<p><font size="+1"><b>CHAPTER SIX </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I WAS SITTING IN an extremely comfortable armchair. Unseen 
  hands had removed the corks from my ears and the blindfold from my eyes. To 
  my right stood a delicately-latticed birdcage in which a chaffinch tweeted. 
  To my left, a tattooed thug brandished a pointed stick. In front of me, ten 
  people dressed entirely in black sat behind a long wooden table: each sported 
  a turquoise badge, pinned over their hearts. The table was cluttered with incomprehensible 
  paraphernalia. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"We are the Turquoise Badge Ten," said the person fifth from 
  the left. I can't say I was surprised. "Each of us will ask you one question," 
  she continued, "You will answer the questions fully and frankly. Should we suspect 
  that you are withholding from us any information, whether or not we deem it 
  pertinent we will bid our thug to poke at you with his pointed stick." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have ever found yourself in a situation remotely similar 
  to this, you will understand why my immediate reaction was to ask where the 
  lavatory was. All ten of them sighed as one, as if they were used to such shenanigans. 
  The thug pointed to a yellow painted arrow on the floor. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Follow the arrows," he said, "And come right back." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The lavatory was at the end of a twisting series of corridors. 
  There were five cubicles and a single urinal. When I had poohed, flushed, and 
  washed my hands at the strangely gigantic sink, it struck me that there was 
  nothing to stop me roaming at will through the HQ until I saw fit to return 
  to my interrogation. Leaving the lavatory, I pranced off down yet another corridor, 
  and pushed open the first door I came to. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The room I entered was dark and dingy. I was unable to find 
  a light-switch, so I closed the door behind me and waited until my eyes had 
  got used to the gloom. Before they had done so, I was almost overpowered by 
  the unmistakeable smell of hamster. I held a kerchief over my nose and gagged. 
  Why had I not noticed the stench as soon as I opened the door? Oh, let's just 
  say I forgot to mention it. Gradually, I picked out the details of the room: 
  flock wallpaper; scuffed lino; enormous bells, their clappers removed, lying 
  on their sides; a hospital trolley shoved into a corner; torn bits of maps pinned 
  higgledy-piggledy on the walls; a pile of papers jammed into the open drawer 
  of a filing-cabinet; a jewel-encrusted spittoon; a dead moth; a garden incinerator; 
  an empty crate; a cage containing abundant straw and seemingly dozens of hamsters; 
  a glass eye in a bowl of water; and a cracked jug upon the mantelpiece, on the 
  handle of which a beetle dozed. Was there anything here worthy of my attention? 
  No. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Back in the interrogation room, I found that the thug had been 
  replaced by a coeval, fairer of complexion, and armed with a proper spear rather 
  than a pointed stick. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"You were gone rather longer than we expected," said one of 
  the Turquoise Badge Ten, "We sent our other thug off to track you down." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I got a bit lost," I explained. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Wool cannot be pulled over our eyes," I was told, "Bear that 
  in mind." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Right," I said, sitting down hurriedly in the armchair seconds 
  before Thug Number 2 was about to manhandle me into it. "We will each now ask 
  you a question," said the one furthest to the right, "I will go first. What 
  is your name?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ignatz Milkbone," I lied: it was, of course, an anagram. The 
  fact that not one of the Ten batted an eyelid reassured me: apparently it was 
  possible to pull wool over their eyes. I can be quite naive, I'm afraid. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Why are you wearing a false moustache?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Damn! Maybe they weren't as credulous as I had thought. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Er," I mumbled, "It was given to me by a friend as an, um, 
  St Septimus' Day present. If I hadn't stuck it to my upper lip with industrial-strength 
  adhesive, he'd have been heartbroken. Hm. I can see that you're not convinced. 
  Shall I try again? Be full and frank, you said. The moustache is part of my 
  Tip-Top Disguise Kit. Before setting out from home, I adopted a variety of devices 
  designed to conceal my true identity." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Feeling rather foolish, I detached the moustache, removed the 
  wads of cotton wool which I had wedged inside my mouth to puff out my cheeks, 
  and took off the clear-glass spectacles set in violent crimson frames which 
  I had been wearing since I set out on my adventure. Scarcely had I done so than 
  the third question was rapped at me. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Have you ever read <i>The Dictionary of Stains </i>by Walter 
  Mad?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There was no need to think up a pack of lies this time. I had 
  never even heard of the book. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"During your journey here, on the Thursday night when you camped 
  on a knoll next to the Great Frightening River, our special agent went through 
  your pockets. Among the items which he has brought to our attention is a commemorative 
  postage stamp depicting the captain of the winning team in the 1904 Hooting 
  Yard Water-Tennis Championship. The cancellation is rather smudged. We believe 
  that the stamp is one of a set belonging to a client of ours. Would you care 
  to tell us how it came into your possession?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Certainly," I replied, eager to please. "It is a stamp I have 
  always treasured. It was given to me by a school-friend. He was lanky, and covered 
  in boils. His name is [forgotten, alas!], and I believe he is the nephew of 
  the philatelist Istvan Plunkett." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was rather pleased with my reply. It was honest, for one 
  thing, and it contained little details which I hoped would ingratiate me with 
  my questioners. They did not stir: I might as well have been prating in a foreign 
  tongue. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"The fifth question is not, strictly speaking, a question at 
  all. It is more in the way of a command. Tell us everything you know about Istvan 
  Plunkett." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Oh, I could go on for hours," I replied, "I have read, what, 
  three or four biographies of that towering figure." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Tell us everything you know," the speaker repeated. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was not exaggerating when I said I could go on for hours. 
  By the time I had reached the exciting story of Plunkett's trip to Iceland when 
  he was seventeen, the thug had dozed off. The Turquoise Badge Ten were surprised, 
  I think, at the breadth of my erudition. I could not have done better had I 
  been Plunkett himself. I knew all about the blotting paper scandal, the woodland 
  hike which ended with the accidental death of Plunkett's mentor and champion, 
  Father Pod, the rigours of his boating, the weft of his tunics, the grease on 
  his sister's lantern: I went on and on, so much so that the thug had to be roused 
  to fetch me a glass of water. Eventually, one of the Ten held up her hand and 
  bid me cease. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Wait, wait!" she cried, "This is most interesting, but I think 
  we have heard enough for one day. Let us retire to our hammocks, and reconvene 
  in the morning." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had no idea what time it was: the special agent had pocketed 
  my tin-and-titanium alarm clock. The Turquoise Badge Ten filed out of the room, 
  and, at a prod from the thug's spear, I followed them. We passed down the twisting 
  corridors to the Chamber of Hammocks, a lushly-carpeted room in which a dozen 
  hammocks had been strung up in a neat row. I was guided to mine by the thug, 
  but before I could clamber into it, one of the Ten held aloft a Vitus Bering 
  Pennant and everyone else in the room stood to attention. I thought it best 
  to ape them. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Let us sing a sea shanty!" shouted the pennant-bearer, whereupon 
  the lot of them, thug included, burst into song. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Yo ho ho! Land ahoy! Paint the deck with varnish! </i></font></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">We've been at sea for twenty years and we've run out of 
  rum. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">Picture our atrocious state: we are quite disgusting. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">The captain's beard is caked with salt, his timbers have 
  been shivered. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">What a useless ship we've got! The wood is surely rotten. 
  </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">The whole hulk stinks of mouldy meat and half the crew has 
  scurvy. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">We shall dock in half an hour, if they'll let us in. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">If they won't, just you watch, we'll start our cannons roaring. 
  </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">The harbourmaster's flying flags, not one of them's a white 
  one. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">One's got a plague warning writ upon it, and one's stained 
  red for danger. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">Yo ho ho! We'll sail on! There is no berth here for us. 
  </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">We have no berth in any port, but what the hell, life is 
  short, </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">We'll sail upon these ugly seas until we're stricken by 
  disease, </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">Until each crewman's sickened and died, each corpse been 
  hurled over the side, </font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="+1">And washed to shore on the high tide, and washed to shore 
  on the high tide. </font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">And with that, they all tumbled into their hammocks and started 
  to snore. They made such a din that I couldn't be bothered to even try to sleep. 
  Instead, I crept tippy-toes out of the room and scurried along the corridors 
  until I found a cocoa-dispensing machine. I started to read the instructions, 
  but they were so complicated that I gave up, and extricated a steaming hot plastic 
  tumbler of cocoa by means of a few well-aimed kicks and a great deal of shaking 
  and clattering. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Squatting on the floor, I reviewed the situation. The Turquoise 
  Badge Ten, Walter Mad, and Istvan Plunkett: all of them were in some way connected 
  with the purloined stamp collection. Fig-like, I leapt intuitively to a theory. 
  Indefatigable collector that he was, I conjectured, Plunkett had an obsessive 
  desire to own Mister Patch's pre-adhesive album: the Ten were charged with the 
  task of obtaining it for him. They in turn employed Walter Mad as their agent. 
  If this was the case, I was wasting my time - and possibly risking my life - 
  by remaining at the HQ. I had to track down Plunkett, obviously. Draining my 
  cocoa-tumbler, I got to my feet, and capered off down the gas-lit corridor to 
  find the way out. </font></p>
