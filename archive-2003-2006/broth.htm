<p><b><font size="+2">THE PHIAL OF BROTH</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+2">Or : THE END OF C. W. SPRAINGUE</font></b></p>
<p><b><i><font size="+2">by Frank Key</font></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">Few people alive today remember the highly entertaining music 
  hall act Guesbaldo Sopwith &amp; His Amazing Tea Strainers. Sopwith - real name 
  Cedric William Spraingue - was born in the Damp Building at Hooting Yard in 
  18--, and though his parents dragged him off a-circusing before he could even 
  walk, he always recalled his birthplace with affection. At the turn of the century, 
  when his popularity was at its height, Sopwith returned to Hooting Yard for 
  the first time since infancy, to put on a Christmas Show for the bewildered 
  and the fraught.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The show was of course a tremendous success, and so thrilled 
  were the burlap-shanked mayoral officers of the town that they threw an impromptu 
  banquet for Sopwith. A tent was erected over the ice-rink, the rink itself covered 
  in tough cork matting, and trestle-tables were carried in piled high with such 
  delicacies as were available in Hooting Yard at that time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Sopwith was ushered to a seat at the top table, and a hush 
  descended on the tent as the first course was brought in by the Hooting Yard 
  Duckpond-Cleaner, whose name was Cackbag. This geriatric half-wit carried a 
  capacious tureen containing gallons upon gallons of an iridescent broth, flavoured 
  with pap, rime and bonemeal, and reportedly thoroughly indigestible.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cackbag slopped a ladleful of the broth into Sopwith's rusty 
  bowl, and the majestic entertainer was about to spoon some of the piping hot 
  liquid into his mouth, when of a sudden the tent was filled with cataclasm and 
  pandaemonium.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;Cedric William Spraingue!&quot; The words rang out, re-echoing 
  round the canvas walls. &quot;Tundists have come for you! We will take you now!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Poor Sopwith, ashen, trembling and incontinent, could do little 
  else but to obey the bidding of the unseen Tundists. As bolts of purple light 
  spurted around the tent, and mesmerising noises deafened the townsfolk, he crawled 
  to the entrance flap, a piteous figure on his hands and knees. As soon as he 
  was through the flap, the uproar ceased, the tent interior calmed, the air grew 
  still. Clamour and rack were no more: but Cedric William Spraingue, alias Guesbaldo 
  Sopwith, was gone. Like so many others, he had been taken by the Tundists.Who 
  knows why, or to what end? Like all who fell foul of Tundism, he was ne'er seen 
  on earth again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">His tea strainers, amazing though they may have been, were 
  disposed of through a public auction on the first anniversary of his vanishment. 
  All his other personal effects were sold off, burned, cast into canals, or donated 
  to educational institutions for tiny ones. All, that is, except for one item.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The banquet was abandoned after the Tundists had fallen upon 
  the tent. Small urchins were plucked from the gutters to clear everything away, 
  and were given the uneaten food as a reward. One such urchin, who earlier that 
  day had been held entranced by the Amazing Tea Strainers act, was so upset by 
  the disappearance of Sopwith that he carried the bowl of unslurped broth away 
  with him under his sordid tunic, as a trophy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He kept it at home in his infected hut until it began to moulder 
  and stink out even this most noisome of hovels, whereupon he took it to an apothecary 
  who very carefully encased what was left of the broth in a glass phial, the 
  very phial which is today found underneath the water-pipes in the janitor's 
  cupboard next to the boiler room in the basement of the Museum at Hooting Yard, 
  where it can be viewed by appointment only.</font></p>
