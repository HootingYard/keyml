<p><font size="+3"><b>THE ALBATROSS</b></font> </p>
<p><b><font size="+2">by Augustus Earle & Marigold Chew</font></b> </p>
<p><font size="+1">Being a fine morning, I determined to ascend the mountain. 
  I wore a rather gauche hat. As several parties had before gone up, they had 
  formed a kind of path: at least we endeavoured to trace the same way; but it 
  requires a great deal of nerve to attempt it. Luckily I had swallowed a phial 
  of Dr Gillespie's Brain Tonic for my breakfast. The sides of the mountain are 
  nearly perpendicular; but, after ascending about two hundred feet, it is there 
  entirely covered with wood, which renders the footing much more safe; but in 
  order to get to the wood, the road is so dangerous, that it made me almost tremble 
  to think of it, - slippery grey rocks, and many of them unfortunately loose, 
  so that when we took hold, they separated from the mass, and fell with a horrid 
  rumbling noise. It was a noise not unlike the racket and din I had heard when 
  I inadvertently found myself underneath the stage at the Helsinki Festival of 
  Brusque & Earnest Percussion Music, where I was employed to muck about with 
  the wiring. Here and there were a few patches of grass, the only thing we could 
  depend upon to assist us in climbing, which must be done with extreme caution, 
  for the least slip or false step would dash one to atoms on the rocks below. 
  The rocks were mostly bauxite, with the odd clump of thack. By keeping our eyes 
  constantly looking upwards, and continuing to haul ourselves up, by catching 
  firm hold on this grass, after an hour's painful toil we gained the summit, 
  where we found ourselves on an extended plain, of several miles expanse, which 
  terminates in the peak, composed of dark grey lava, bare and frightful to behold. 
  We stopped to insert our specially-manufactured contact lenses; doing so made 
  such a terrible vision a tad more bearable. We proceeded towards it, the plain 
  gradually rising, but the walking was most fatiguing, over strong rank grass 
  and fern several feet high, with holes concealed under the roots in such a way, 
  that no possible caution could prevent our occasionally falling down into one 
  or other of them, and entirely disappearing, which caused a boisterous laugh 
  amongst the rest; but it frequently happened, while one was making merry at 
  the expense of another, down sunk the laugher himself. By God, that put an end 
  to the cackling! A death-like stillness prevailed in these high regions, and, 
  to my ear, our voices had a strange, unnatural echo, and I fancied our forms 
  appeared gigantic, whilst the air was piercing cold. Icicles began to form on 
  the brims of our hats, so we melted them with the portable bunsen burners we 
  carried in our haversacks. The prospect was altogether very sublime, and filled 
  the mind with awe! Well, my mind, at any rate; I cannot speak for my companions, 
  who were, if truth be told, somewhat cloddish. On the one side, the boundless 
  horizon, heaped up with clouds of silvery brightness, contrasted with some of 
  darker hue, enveloping us in their vapour, and, passing rapidly away, gave us 
  only casual glances of the landscape; and, on the other hand, the sterile and 
  cindery peak, with its venerable head, partly capped with clouds, partly revealing 
  great patches of red cinders, or lava, intermingled with the black rock, produced 
  a most extraordinary and dismal effect. I do not use the words <i>extraordinary</i> 
  and <i>dismal</i> lightly; I give them their full weight, and trust my readers 
  will pause, in contemplative manner, perhaps furrowing their brows. It seemed 
  as though it were still actually burning, to heighten the sublimity of the scene. 
  It burned like the fires of some fresh and urgent hell, a hell far more terrifying 
  than even the most demented Jesuit could conceive. The huge albatross appeared 
  here to dread no interloper or enemy; for their young were on the ground completely 
  uncovered, and the old ones were stalking around them. The albatross, as most 
  ornithologists have argued, is a kind of bird. This bird is the largest of the 
  aquatic tribe; and its plumage is of a most delicate white, excepting the back 
  and the tops of its wings, which are grey: they lay but one egg, on the ground, 
  where they form a kind of nest, by scraping the earth round it. They are not 
  as clever as crows, which know how to manipulate small sticks, although to call 
  them - crows, that is - the Isambard Kingdom Brunels of the avian realm is rather 
  exaggerating their abilities. After the young one is hatched, it has to remain 
  a year before it can fly; it is entirely white, and covered with a woolly down, 
  which is very beautiful. It is as beautiful as anything ever painted by the 
  Douanier Rousseau, or Grandma Moses, or even Jackson Pollock. As we approached 
  them, they clapped their beaks, with a very quick motion, which made a great 
  noise. This noise was very different to the noise I had heard from under the 
  stage at that long-ago percussion festival; this was more like one of Lothar 
  Preen's <i>Bagatelles for Hammers & Bakelite</i>, particularly number seventy 
  three, with its maddening, repetitive rhythm. This, and throwing up the contents 
  of the stomach, are the only means of offence and defence they seem to possess. 
  Dobson claimed in one of his pamphlets that in some languages the albatross 
  is called the <i>regurgitato bird</i>, but this is probably spurious, like so 
  much of Dobson's scribbling. The old ones, which are valuable on account of 
  their feathers, my companions made dreadful havoc amongst, knocking on the head 
  all they could come up with. This I had not expected; appalled, I took out my 
  revolver and managed to shoot four of my bloodthirsty pals, which put an end 
  to the bird-massacre; and I aimed at their legs, so there were no human fatalities, 
  for which the Lord be praised. </font></p>
