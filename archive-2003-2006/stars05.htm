<p><font size="+1"><b>CHAPTER FIVE </b></font> </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">ON MY FATHER'S TWENT</font><font size="+1">Y first 
  birthday, Professor Underlip - or Walter Mad, as I had better call him - was 
  forty. Almost a year had passed since poor Patch told me the story of the theft, 
  so by my calculations, Mad was now ninety eight: check that yourself, I think 
  you'll find it's correct. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">My first stop, having set out upon my quest, was 
  at the reference library of Spangles, a market town some three days' journey 
  from home. Resting my haversack in the cloakroom, I charged into the newspaper 
  archive and consulted the biographical index, which consisted of untold thousands 
  of little pencil-scrivened cards housed in a series of metal filing cabinets. 
  The index had been devised by a certain Riggory Dewe, an amateur who had also 
  turned his mind to the design of oars, the analysis of socks, and a revolutionary 
  scheme for the eradication of mumps in the Trobriand Islands. When I have finished 
  with this story, I have a good mind to write a thumping great biography of Dewe: 
  he was a gifted and fascinating man. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Not the least of his accomplishments was the Spangles 
  Newspaper Reference Index, a scheme which, to my knowledge, has never been used 
  elsewhere, for reasons which mystify me. I intend to write a lengthy chapter 
  on Dewe's system in the biography, so I will not go into detail here. As a taster, 
  however, I reprint below the contents of the Walter Mad index card. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">Unzipping a little bag full of tokens, I made 
  my way to the issuing desk and requested newspaper number 644000012: there being 
  no obvious place to start, I thought I may as well plunge in at random and discover 
  why Mad had questioned the existence of fish. Pocketing my token, the librarian 
  pointed towards a small wooden bench, and requested that I sit there until the 
  newspaper was delivered from the vaults. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">There were five other people waiting: one had 
  a long grey beard; one was inspecting a scrap of paper on which arcane details 
  of ships' moorings had been roughly scribbled; one was chewing on a radish; 
  one seemed fast asleep; and the fifth, next to whom I sat down, was cradling 
  in his hairy hands a .44 Pugsley - an alarmingly powerful revolver - which he 
  immediately poked into the small of my back. At the same moment, his mouth, 
  full of an implausible number of filthy, unbrushed teeth, was jammed next to 
  my right ear-hole. Noises issued from this mouth, but such was my terror that 
  at first I was unable to wring any meaning from them: it was like listening 
  to my mother. Slowly - although in truth it can only have taken a few seconds 
  - the whispers assailing my ear congealed into sensible words: if anything, 
  my terror heightened. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Act naturally," I heard, "Stand up, walk out 
  of the library, and go towards the owl sanctuary - it's on your left, past the 
  baths, the chemist's shop, the Town Hall and the pigeon lofts." </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Ung," I said, for which my spine was prodded 
  rather painfully by the Pugsley. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">So I stood up, looked wildly about me and, seeing 
  no librarians dashing to my assistance, made my way towards the owl sanctuary. 
  Ten minutes later, arriving at a clump of simnel trees in which dozens of owls 
  were snoozing, my abductor ordered me to halt. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"What do you want with me?" I asked, in a quavering 
  little voice. The gun-toting git was still behind me, and I dared not look round. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"I trade in tin futures," he said mysteriously. 
  I waited for further details, but he remained silent. At times like these, I 
  have an annoying tendency to start babbling, so I did. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Ah, tin. An intriguing metal, isn't it? I remember 
  once reading a study of metal-planet affinities which allied tin to Jupiter. 
  Apparently the ancient Etruscans called the planet Jupiter Tins - " </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">He clouted me on the head with his free hand, 
  so I shut up. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"When I am not trading in tin futures," he rasped, 
  "I act as a special agent for the Turquoise Badge Ten." He paused to let that 
  sink in, but I had no idea what he was talking about, and I told him so. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"The Turquoise Badge Ten," he explained, "Is an 
  impossibly powerful secret society. Woe unto the nit who incurs its wrath, as 
  you have done. Take off your hat. Good: put it on the ground directly in front 
  of you. The Turquoise Badge Ten sent me to forestall you in your Walter Mad 
  researches: unfortunately, I have not been given permission to kill you. For 
  some reason best known to themselves, they have ordered me to swipe your hat, 
  to clout you twice upon the head - there, that's the second - and to put you 
  into a crate and take you to their headquarters. I am now going to collect the 
  crate, and to make sure you do not run away, I am going to bury you up to your 
  waist. Hand me that shovel." </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">God knows where the crate was: it took him about 
  four hours to fetch it. During that time, when I had finished sobbing and shouting 
  fruitlessly for help, it struck me that perhaps this was all for the best, and 
  that being delivered into the clutches of the Turquoise Badge Ten, far from 
  being a terrible calamity, was an unexpected opportunity to get to the heart 
  of the matter. The special agent was a considerate man, in his way. He had insisted 
  that I wrap a large sheet of oilcloth around my legs and feet, so that, when 
  submerged in the earth, my boots and trousers would not get muddy. From a sack, 
  he took some floral-embroidered cushions and placed them comfortingly around 
  me. He set up a little folding-table and arranged on it a packet of trout-paste 
  sandwiches, a flask of cocoa, a fly-swatter, a Tilly lamp, and a selection of 
  reading matter, including Gargle's <i>The Life and Times of Colonel Bigot</i>, 
  half a dozen improving tracts published by the Society for the Regulation of 
  Orphanages, a rare edition of a tremendously exciting sci-fi yarn by Chlorine 
  Winslow, and the cumulative index, bound in greaseproof paper, of the <i>Journal 
  of Nosebleed Research</i>. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">It was getting dark, and the owls were waking, 
  when my abductor reappeared, trundling a wheelbarrow on which the crate rocked 
  unsteadily. By the time he had dug me out of the ground, he was puffed out. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Look," I said, "I'm quite happy to accompany 
  you. We can take it in turns to push the wheelbarrow. Just before we get to 
  the HQ I'll jump into the crate: that way you can pretend you've followed your 
  orders to the letter." And, of course, I'd be able to memorise the route: I 
  learned a thing or two from Fig, you know. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Splendid, splendid," said the special agent, 
  "I must say I wasn't looking forward to pushing this damnable crate, with you 
  inside it, for a forty mile stretch. I have a metal pin in my leg." </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">We shook hands in a sort of hearty, two-chaps-together 
  way. I fancied he was smiling behind his starched linen mask, worn to ensure 
  that I could not identify him at a later date. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"There's a spot of cocoa left, if you'd like some," 
  I offered. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Yum," he said. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">As I stooped to pour out the remains of the flask, 
  he sneaked up behind me and whipped a blindfold around my head. The hot cocoa 
  splashed on my hand and I whimpered. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">"Sorry about that," he said, reasonably, "But 
  I can't have you knowing the location of the Turquoise Badge Ten HQ. If we meet 
  anyone on the way, I'll pass you off as a victim of some particularly hideous 
  crime. I am now going to insert a pair of corks into your ears, so you won't 
  be able to retrace the route from auditory clues. And don't worry - I'll make 
  sure you don't bump into anything." </font></p>
