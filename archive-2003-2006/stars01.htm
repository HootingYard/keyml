<p><font size="+1"><b>CHAPTER ONE</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">THE FIRST STAMP IN my collection was an 1898 badly-perforated 
  14h maroon rectangle on 9x5 gummed tinsy paper, depicting the shallow grave 
  of the whaling captain Rastus Binns, etched from an image taken by a nebulon, 
  a now-forgotten photographic machine. My father presented it to me on my sixteenth 
  birthday, with a gleam in his eye and alcohol on his breath. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Two months later, I acquired my second stamp, steamed off an 
  envelope which I found discarded in Monsignor Sinkpail's wastepaper basket. 
  I was ever the prying sort. This one was a lavish three-colour design on waterbath 
  paper, 8x6, the zealous franking of which almost obliterated a picture of the 
  dirigible <i>Grapplinghook</i>, exploding into a fireball over the Great Beige 
  Dam on the twenty third of June 1907. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The third and fourth stamps were given to me by a lanky, boil-plagued 
  schoolfriend whose name I forget. One showed a blurred view of an unidentified 
  mountain range, the other a fiendishly-spiked cactus against a bright yellow 
  background. By this time I had bought myself an album and, optimistically, a 
  packet of five thousand stamp hinges. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In October of the same year, my father, the Monsignor, and 
  my schoolfriend were drowned, when the boat in which we were rounding a northern 
  headland capsized. As the only swimmer aboard, I was able to struggle back to 
  shore, sopping wet, exhausted, but still alive. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I spent two months abed in the school sick room, at first of 
  necessity, later wallowing in the unaccustomed comfort. My sheets were changed 
  daily by the matron, I was fed with delicacies forbidden to the other pupils, 
  and, of course, I was excused from all lessons and sports, allowed simply to 
  idle my time away poring over my stamp collection, which now became my consuming 
  interest. From my sick bed, I clipped out coupons from magazines and sent off 
  for packets of approvals. A pockmarked prefect visited me one day and gave me 
  as a gift his entire collection, upwards of two thousand thematics - mostly 
  gorges, flags, insects and executions. Matron dutifully soaked off the stamps 
  from the school's daily postbag, until I explained as tactfully as I could that 
  I had more than enough definitives of King Vincenzo, left- <i>and </i>right-profile, 
  brown, cream and puce, and had space in my album for no more. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In January, I was forced to return to my class, but within 
  days, on account of my artificially-induced pallor and neurasthenic fits, I 
  was sent off home for further recuperation. Majestic horses delivered me from 
  the railway station to our coastal mansion, where my mother greeted me with 
  a demented clap on the head, before handing me over to Mister Patch, the retainer, 
  who carried me to my room and deposited me on the bed. I remained there, artfully 
  malingering, for the next two years. Throughout that time, I saw my mother only 
  twice: her derangement pre-dated her widowhood, and I was pleased to note that 
  still, still, she passed her days drawing up plans for a gigantic marble monument 
  to commemorate a footpad who had been hanged in Chockbung on Boxing Day 1804. 
  The monument was never built, of course, but its design, endlessly revised, 
  kept my mother busy for the best part of her life. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had been carted off to the first in a series of brutal schools 
  at seven, and had spent many of my holidays with relatives: these two bed-ridden 
  years, then, afforded my first real opportunity to get to know Mister Patch. 
  He had been in service to my family for as long as anyone could remember, but 
  I had only dim memories of him from my own childhood. Now, as a daily visitor 
  to my room, he became my closest friend. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unlike many fictional retainers, Patch was neither wrinkled 
  nor obsequious. He looked like a pirate: bushy black beard, wooden leg, frantic 
  long hair and a black eyepatch. "Patch", it appeared, was only a nickname. He 
  had been dubbed such by his parents when still a tot, after an accident involving 
  an extremely sharp pointed thing took out his left eye. He no longer remembered 
  his real name, and nor did anyone else. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What I liked most about Patch was his cavalier disregard of 
  his social position. Had I been foolish enough to send him on errands, or to 
  order him about, he would have spat at me. My mother, of course, was too distracted 
  even to contemplate asking Patch to <i>do</i> anything, but my two spinster 
  aunts - Daisy and Maisie, who also lived at the mansion - had the terrible habit 
  of commanding Patch to do things they were quite capable of doing for themselves, 
  like fetching their breakfasts, or pruning the hydrangeas, or taking their repellent 
  little dogs for a walk. Patch fixed them with a glare of magnificent contempt, 
  then unleashed a projectile of spittle at them, and turned on his heel. He never 
  did a stroke of work unless he wanted to: no doubt that shared inclination drew 
  us together. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">His visits to my room began on the day he carried me there, 
  and continued throughout the two years I lay abed. At first, misconstruing his 
  character, I tried to fool him, dabbing weakly at my brow as he came in, emitting 
  the odd groan as I saw fit. After a week, Patch sat at the end of my bed and 
  gave me a good talking to. He did not give two pins whether or not I was sick; 
  it was all the same to him whether I lived or died; would I like to join him 
  as he worked his way through my late father's wine cellar? He drew from his 
  pocket a bottle of 1904 Brut Glabb, uncorked it with his shining teeth, and 
  took a mighty swig. I proffered my tooth-mug, and our camaraderie was born. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Patch was keenly interested in my stamp collection, which now 
  filled two enormous albums, each bound in some sort of animal hide - reindeer, 
  perhaps, or wildebeeste. He seemed to know everything there was to know about 
  perforations, overprinting, variants, control numbers, shades, forgeries and 
  proofs. His own speciality, he informed me on a wet Thursday in March, was the 
  pre-adhesive period, with particular regard to the postal histories of Hoon, 
  Mins, Berberdept and Vug. He announced, with a strange tremor in his voice, 
  that his collection of covers, emblazoned with inky cancellations made by a 
  variety of rubber, potato, and gutta percha printing devices, had been stolen 
  from him exactly fifty seven years ago to the day. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"By whom?" I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Patch settled himself on an assortment of cushions and told 
  me the story of the theft. It had taken place on Papa's twenty first birthday. 
  There had been a party, here at the mansion, and among those attending had been 
  a noted scientist. Over dinner, while Patch skulked in the cellars pouring bottles 
  of vintage Glabb down his throat, the talk had turned to the recent experiments 
  of the mesmerist Walter Mad, who claimed to be able to propel the spirits of 
  his subjects a thousand years into the future: Patch could hear every word of 
  the discussion, transmitted down to the cellars through a secret system of pneumatic 
  tubes. The talk became heated, half the party poo-pooing Mad as a fraudster, 
  the other half defending him as a new kind of visionary whose discoveries would 
  revolutionise our understanding of the universe. Just before the ladies were 
  due to retire to the drugs-cabinet, Professor Underlip - the noted scientist 
  - suggested a simple experiment which, he said, would prove indubitably that 
  Walter Mad was nothing but a trickster. Down in the cellars, Patch drained his 
  umpteenth bottle and decided to return to the dining room to witness the Professor's 
  little diversion. The wily retainer slid inconspicuously into the room as Underlip 
  was unpacking from his mysterious blue bag an array of outre scientific apparatus. 
  To the consternation of the dinner guests, he cleared a space on the table and 
  placed thereon giant carboys, Faure's accumulators, voltaic piles, coils of 
  wire, Coddington lenses, and great blocks of non-conducting porcelain. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"How in heaven did you fit all that into your mysterious blue 
  bag?" exclaimed Mrs Cambodge. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"We men of science do not dilly-dally," replied the Professor, 
  an enigmatic twinkle in his eyes. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He called for a volunteer, and after two minutes of hubbub, 
  it was agreed that my father should have the honour of submitting himself to 
  Professor Underlip's experiment. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Think of it as your finest birthday gift!" cooed Mrs Cambodge. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Papa was steered into an armchair, whereupon a grotesque sponge 
  hood was fitted to his head by the Professor. Orange flaps on the hood were 
  connected by wires to the gleaming equipment on the dining-table, which hissed 
  gently, letting forth jets of gas. Underlip attached a couple of wire clips 
  to Papa's hands, fixing them in place with strips of grivelling tape. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Palms up, Donald," he commanded. (Donald was not my father's 
  name, but let that pass: this all happened a long time ago.) Underlip placed 
  a potato in Papa's right hand, and an aniseed pill in his left. Then he stood 
  back, cleared his throat, and made an announcement. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "You are about to witness 
  a most extraordinary experiment! I suggest that you all sit fast in your chairs 
  and make no attempt to stir." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mister Patch, hiding behind a tallboy, watched as the Professor 
  fiddled about with the dials, chocks and hooters on his equipment. Then, with 
  a scarcely perceptible finger-flick, he switched it on. There was a flash of 
  brilliant light, accompanied by a monstrous roaring noise. Everyone in the room 
  was made temporarily blind and deaf: with the exception, of course, of the ear-plugged 
  and eye-shaded Professor Underlip, who took the opportunity to rifle through 
  the house, filling his strange blue bag with valuables. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Among which," concluded Mister Patch, "was my collection of 
  covers from the pre-adhesive period." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Smite me with a bludgeon, Patch!" I exclaimed, "Do you mean 
  to say the blackguard made off with his loot?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Indeed he did," said the retainer, "When our sight and hearing 
  returned some twenty minutes later, the Prof was gone, and many a valuable heirloom 
  with him." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Could he not be tracked down?" I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He has not been seen from that day to this," replied Patch. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had further questions, of course, but I am sure you can guess 
  what they were: the answers to them were detailed, verbose, and in many cases 
  highly intriguing, but you do not need to be that well-informed to enjoy this 
  story. You get the gist, after all, don't you? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The point is that, some months later, I vowed to devote myself 
  to the task of finding Patch's stamp collection and returning it to its owner. 
  My decision was made in the autumn of that frightful year. Patch had suffered 
  an attack of the bindings, and was now virtually bed-ridden himself. Of course, 
  I had grown so used to my situation that it was quite out of the question for 
  me to haul myself the few dozen yards along the corridor to his room: but I 
  bid his replacement factotum, a dishevelled ex-convict named Brewster, to wheel 
  Mister Patch to me every day, at four p.m. sharp, armed with half a dozen bottles 
  from the cellar and a brace of tumblers. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was during one such drunken afternoon that Patch began to 
  sob. Sympathetically, I mussed his hair: it was like a bale of fusewire. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ouch!" I said, "What's the matter, Mister Patch?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Boo hoo hoo!" was all I got out of him for half an hour. Then, 
  draining the last bottle of Sprinkler's Nightmare, he confessed that, despite 
  appearances, he was a sentimental old fool, and that it was his dearest wish, 
  before death stole upon him and he was enwrapped in a grisly shroud, that he 
  could once more feast his eyes - sorry, eye - upon his priceless collection 
  of pre-adhesive covers, the collecting of which had made his boyhood a sun-glazed 
  idyll, its theft by the unspeakable Underlip having reduced him to the pitiful, 
  cantankerous wretch now sprawled before me. Well. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some minutes later Brewster arrived to take Mister Patch back 
  to his room, but I had time enough to say something along the lines of: "Fear 
  not! I will track down your collection, and yes, before you expire, you will 
  once more hold your album in trembling hands!", although I may not have put 
  it quite so resoundingly as that. </font></p>
