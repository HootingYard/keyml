<p><font size="+1"> <b>What is Hooting Yard? </b></font></p>
<font size="+1">A splendid place. Much cake is eaten there. </font>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Where is it? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let me give you directions. Turn around, head for the door, 
  turn left, past the baths, the chemist's shop, the Town Hall, the pigeon lofts 
  and the owl sanctuary, along Blister Lane, go right at the duckpond, then up 
  Pang Hill until you reach the gasworks. Now strike off down Amnesiac Lane towards 
  the graveyard, hop over the fences and head west to Bodger's Spinney. Dip your 
  cup in the stream & rest awhile. Make your way to the mysterious village, where 
  the dandelions are blue and the air is thick with the stench of vinegar. Dither 
  in the square until you spot the newspaper kiosk, where you will be able to 
  buy a gazetteer of the village and its hinterland. Study this carefully. Whisk 
  yourself along the towpath of the canal & cross it at Sawdust Bridge, following 
  thereafter the course of the Great Frightening River. Camp out on the knoll 
  & eat up your sausages. There are many butterflies to be seen there. Do not 
  net them. Hare ye on, past the big Fireworks Factory & the Dental Institute 
  (you will notice that the cross bar is missing from the T, so it reads as the 
  Denial Institute) until you find yourself in a thicket of nettles. Free yourself 
  with the aid of secateurs. Then you must catch the funicular railway to the 
  very top of Pilgarlic Tor, and hurry down the other side on foot, splashing 
  through puddles until you reach the infected pig farmer's house. Hide in his 
  orchard & snooze. Now stride with giant steps across fields of barley, turnips, 
  bracken & furze, yes, bracken & bracken & furze & javelin weed, past the abandoned 
  quarry & on through a knot of allotments, finding shelter in a hut empty but 
  for the rusted remnants of a lawnmower, the skull of a badger, & a smudged & 
  unreadable instruction manual for a pencil sharpener. As the sun rises, trudge 
  south, skirting the Shabby Lime-Kilns & the serried belvederes of Haemoglobin 
  Towers until you hit upon an astonishing tract of rhubarb fields, at the far 
  end of which, nestled beside the alleyway leading off to Plunkett Hall, you 
  will find Hooting Yard, where you will be welcomed. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Gosh!</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Indeed. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Will I need a phrasebook? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">No. But do make sure you are armed with the necessary documentation, 
  certificates & so on. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Such as? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Albigensian heresy clearance, bee permits, cartography qualifications, 
  dust inspection slip, encomia, freight dockets, guarantees of rectitude, Hall 
  of Mirrors at the Palace of Hoon visitor's ticket, ice readings, jalopy licence, 
  klaxon waiver, lip prints, mortuary attendant's sash, night soil test results, 
  orlop deck pass, pigsnout haberdasher boneyard ravings gumboil ratification 
  tag, question paper, rag & bone chit, &quot;Savonarola's Wisdom-in-a-Bucket&quot; 
  proof of purchase, thumping headache medication prescription, Ülm map, visual 
  impairment notice, wax thing, x-rays envelope, your own pod, and nothing whatsoever 
  that begins with Z. All this stuff must be packed into a satchel which you hand 
  over at the gate. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>What sort of gate is it? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A white wicket gate, if you must know. A guarded white wicket 
  gate, to ensure that there is no monkey business. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Oh, so I can't bring my monkey? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Certainly not. Even if you could, your ape would be driven 
  insane by the mere sight of the Duty Git who guards the gate. His is a terrible 
  & gruesome countenance, & his voice can extinguish the very stars in the heavens. 
  Indeed, there have been complaints from Plunkett Hall. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>When I get past the Duty Git, what then? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then you will be ushered aboard a dilapidated charabanc & taken 
  to meet Mr Key & Ms Cradledew. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>And who might they be? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let me read to you their potted biographies. Frank Key was 
  born in a lighthouse. Much hectoring attended his infant years. As a youth, 
  he fell in with an itinerant trio of bell-ringers named Mat & Nat & Bam. Often 
  plagued by whitlows, he is no stranger to medical interventions of a peculiarly 
  jarring kidney. Of late, he has been living quietly on the attic floor of an 
  abandoned & crumbling hotel, where he is visited by his familiar, who keeps 
  him entertained with piccolo recitals & the chewing of brazil nuts. A keen ornithologist, 
  Frank recently received a special tin badge from the Hooting Yard Cormorant 
  Patrol. He likes to buff his badge to a shine with a frayed rag. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>And what of Ms Cradledew? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Again, the potted biography is my source. After a brief & successful 
  career as a child, Pansy Cradledew put to good use her almost fanatical interest 
  in pencil cases. She was the youngest ever person to become an Adept of the 
  Order of the Hinges, and from this platform was able to launch a series of sparsely-attended 
  lecture tours. Much enamoured of the pingpong table & its accoutrements, Pansy 
  too is <i>au fait</i> with bird lore, & is often to be found daubing any available 
  wall surface with enormous paintings of starlings, corncrakes & buffleheads. 
  Despite persistent rumours, Pansy is not a flapper. Perhaps she is being mistaken 
  for her cousin Tallulah. Do you require any further information? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Not at the moment. I must say I like the cut of their jibs! 
  </b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As well you might. The projecting arm of Pansy's crane is crimson 
  & elegant. The boom of Frank's derrick is blue & sparkling. Only a few have 
  seen fit to remark on their jibs. I salute you for that. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>I am not used to being saluted. </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fear not. Salutes are rarely essayed in Hooting Yard, nor are 
  forelocks tugged. I was using a figure of speech. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Gasp! </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oh? Have I hit upon a raw nerve? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>No, no. My gasp was one of awe, for look! Look how the stars 
  are glittering so brightly above that miserable-looking hut near the wicket 
  gate!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Ah yes, they twinkle so. It is a profound mystery that the 
  firmament takes on so sublime an aspect over so humble a hut. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>What is the hut? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is where the Duty Git stockpiles his potatoes. No more, 
  no less. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Tell me more about the Duty Git. </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I am afraid I am not at liberty to do so. I once let slip what 
  I considered a trifling bit of gossip about him - something about his shoes, 
  or his boots, or his head, or his ectoplasm - & let me tell you that the ensuing 
  pandaemonium is not something I ever wish to witness again for all the tea in 
  China. There is only so much one person can take in a lifetime, however long 
  it may please the Lord to eke. Would you care for some buns or cake? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>That's kind of you. </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I said, Hooting Yard offers a warm welcome. There is celery 
  too, if you are peckish. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Thank you. Pansy & Frank seem charming, & you have been 
  most solicitous. So I'm rather puzzled by your alarming hints about the Duty 
  Git.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> No doubt you want to know what in the name of heaven he does 
  with all those potatoes! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Not particularly. It's just that you make him sound so fearsome 
  & terrifying.</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He is indeed. He is an excellent myrmidon & no mistake. Now, 
  if you will finish munching that celery & sweep up the crumbs from the bun I 
  gave you, I shall take you by the hand, or should I say mitten, & lead you fondly 
  into Hooting Yard. Tarry a while, stay alert, & try your best not to frighten 
  the owls. </font> </p>
