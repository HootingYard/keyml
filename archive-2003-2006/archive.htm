<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="feb05.htm">FEBRUARY 2005 :</a></b> 
  Such an exciting month at Hooting Yard that Mr Key had to go and lie down for 
  two months, hence the absence of any entries for March and April. Here you can 
  read about bags in the Bible, Rasputin, moths, the Electric Prunes, Muggletonians, 
  haruspices, and both Tiny Enid and Serpentine Claude.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="jan05.htm">JANUARY 2005 : </a></b>We 
  enter the new year with Anubis and Ra, pageantry and ice, Saint Mungo and Agent

  and the Hooting Yard Gallery Of Goo!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="dec04.htm">DECEMBER 2004 :</a></b> 
  Hooting Yard reaches its first birthday and celebrates with tales of wild pigs, 
  vampire bats and days of imbecilic glee, as well as looking at the crucial importance 
  of topiary, the legend of the Grunty Man, the Swiss Family Robinson, and, of 
  course, what happened when Björn and Benny and Anni-Frid and Agnetha were invited 
  to Belshazzar's feast... Gosh!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><a href="nov04.htm"><b>NOVEMBER 2004 :</b></a> 
  includes a note about a rare edition of the Bible, unanswered questions about 
  JFK, my little blind dolly and my little blind crow, a picture of a big black 
  beetle, two pictures of locusts, and all sorts of other magnificently entertaining 
  material for all the family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="oct04.htm">OCTOBER 2004 :</a></b> 
  a cornucopia of delights, including Dobson in the Biblical Land of Nod, railings 
  and pewter, <i>Spem in Alium</i> by Thomas Tallis, bees, chewed things, Richard 
  Nixon, Emily Dickinson and Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp, paper crumpling, and

  the return of Mrs Gubbins, Dobson's fear of squirrels, Christopher Plummer as 
  Atahualpa, bean diseases, a horrible cave, and a selection of 18th century newspaper 
  headlines, together with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alexander Graham Bell &amp; 
  Ringo Starr...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="aug04.htm">AUGUST 2004 :</a></b> all 
  about celery, gutta percha, neurasthenic shuddering, egg flip, the old town

<p align="left"><b><font size="+1"><a href="jul04.htm">JULY 2004 :</a> </font></b><font size="+1">is 
  there any subject we <i>didn't </i>address in July? Tundism, owls, Ricardo Montalban, 
  glue and gruel and God and hydraulics and tsars and bogs, Emily Dickinson, botched 
  trepanning operations, curd, birds, mucilage, balm in Gilead, and of course 
  an enormously useful Pontiff mnemonic.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="+1"><a href="jun04.htm">JUNE 2004 :</a> </font></b><font size="+1">the 
  definitive return from Technonightmareland! June brought mentions of gnats, 
  Nixon, nuns purporting to be from Finland, little Severin the mystic badger, 
  Ronald Reagan, Belt, Bong &amp; Yaw and at least 44 curlews.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="may04.htm">MAY 2004 :</a></b> still 
  bedevilled by technical trauma, we nevertheless managed to address such issues 
  as &quot;Was Dobson Stalin?&quot;, examine the legacy of Tuesday Weld, ponder 
  Frank's future as the Face of L'Oreal, and sigh at the strange fate of the Besmirched 
  &amp; Bonkers Topiary Man, His Hoodoo &amp; Collapse. All this plus croissants, 
  horses, Stendahl on peas, ogres, vapours and, of course, even more cormorants.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><b><a href="apr04.htm">APRIL 2004 :</a></b></font> 
  <font size="+1">a month which saw hideous and traumatic computer nightmares 
  at Hooting Yard. Despite this, you'll be able to read about Mrs Gubbins and 
  her infatuation with buttons, a noodlehead in peril, Sopwith's so-called "marsh 
  gas years", and the disgusting bilge of Cadet Vig, among other things. </font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="+1"><a href="mar04.htm">MARCH 2004</a> : </font></b><font size="+1">a 
  bumper month - not only the seven dwarves, the administration of lighthouses, 
  and six cows and a bee, not only <i>Chutney On My Spats </i>by Beerpint &amp; 
  <i>How I Invented A Revolutionary New Birdseed </i>by Dobson, but soup, cake, 
  gluttony, Chewism, jars, cormorants and a leech mishap.</font></p>
