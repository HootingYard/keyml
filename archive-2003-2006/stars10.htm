<p><font size="+1"><b>CHAPTER TEN </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>A WEEK OR SO after the young rapscallion had set off on 
  his travels, I was astonished one morning to receive a letter from my Uncle 
  Nobby. Like the rest of the family, I had assumed he was dead. Twenty years 
  ago, weighed down by life's travails, he had stowed away on the steamship </i>Corrugated 
  Cardboard<i>, bound for Tantarabim. Engulfed by storms, the ship went down ten 
  miles off the coast of Sprague, with - according to the newspapers - no survivors. 
  We had held a little memorial service for him, and donated his few possessions 
  to the St Odo Rest Home for the Bewildered and the Fraught.</i> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Yet there could be no mistaking the authorship of the letter: 
  it was in Uncle Nobby's curiously ham-fisted handwriting, and the paper gave 
  off the trademark reek of spam and hair-oil which made my uncle such a trying 
  fellow to be within ten feet of.</i> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dear Agamemnon, <i>it read,</i> I have returned to the land 
  of my birth after two decades of quite preposterous escapades. I am staying 
  in the Bodger's Spinney Hotel, and would very much like you to join me for breakfast 
  on Thursday the sixteenth. Come on horseback, for I will want to purchase your 
  steed, and will pay you well. All the best, Uncle Nobby. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I decided not to alert any other members of my family to 
  this intriguing happenstance. Nor did I inform milady: in any case, she was 
  so far gone in her bafflement that she would not have known what I was talking 
  about. I was rather worried about her two sisters, who would doubtless insist 
  on a detailed explanation for my absence, but as chance would have it they were 
  drowned in the duckpond on the very day the letter arrived.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i> That was the ninth: I had a week to prepare myself to confront 
  Uncle Nobby. This at least gave me time to nip off to the village to buy a horse, 
  and to take some riding-lessons. I am afraid that I was a rather clumsy pupil, 
  despite the best efforts of Hengist Grudge, my instructor, and I must have cut 
  an ungainly figure clopping along the woodland paths to Bodger's Spinney on 
  the evening of the fifteenth. I put up at an inn overnight, a lewd and boisterous 
  place, where my dignified bearing, metal skull-plate, and whimsical chit-chat 
  met with ridicule from the assembled topers, gamblers, swindlers and ruffians, 
  so that by the time I had given my horse his suppertime oat-tub and retired 
  to my horrible room, I had a black eye, a fractured rib, and a nasty cut on 
  my upper lip, not to mention innumerable bruises, aches, pains and abrasions, 
  plus an impromptu tattoo - the name </i>Enid<i> in blood-bruised italics, set 
  in an arrow-spliced heart - on my left forearm. Enid? </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>In the middle of the night, I awoke to find a maniac carousing 
  at the foot of my bed. Convinced that it was an hallucination, I turned over 
  and went back to sleep. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>At dawn, I awoke in a state of rancour and disgust. Limping 
  downstairs, I was presented with breakfast. Mercifully, the riotous ne'er-do-wells 
  of the previous night were still abed, and I had only the landlord's smirking 
  contempt to deal with. He placed before me a dish of tongue, pig's liver and 
  saveloys, swimming in grease, and a rusty tankard filled to the half-way mark 
  with watered-down milk and cabbage broth. My manners deserted me. I sent both 
  dish and tankard clattering to the floor with a single sweep of my arm, picked 
  up a hefty club, and bashed the landlord thrice about the midriff. Then, without 
  paying my bill, I lurched off to the stables, mounted my horse, and rode away. 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>This was a mistake. I had gone only a few hundred yards 
  when, looking behind me, I saw that I was being pursued by the landlord and 
  a posse of cut-throats. That they meant me harm was not in doubt. I spurred 
  on my horse, but he was aged and weak, and no match for the powerful stallions 
  ridden by my pursuers. The distance between us was closing with every second, 
  and I was so terrified at the thought of my imminent doom that I am afraid I 
  piddled in my pantaloons. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Then, out of nowhere, a motorbike and sidecar came hurtling 
  towards me, screeching to a halt just as the landlord and his crew were about 
  to draw level. The horses - including mine - reared up, frightened, but rather 
  than stampeding away, they seemed transfixed, snorting and whinnying pitifully, 
  as if in thrall of some nameless and intangible menace. The motorcyclist dismounted, 
  took from his pannier a pair of folding crutches, skipped lightly round to the 
  sidecar, and helped his passenger to clamber out of it, manoeuvering him skilfully 
  onto the crutches. When the motorcyclist removed the safety helmet from the 
  lame man's head, we all let out gasps of astonishment. It was Father Ninian 
  Gumbeetle SJ, the world-famous withered Jesuit! </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>The landlord and his cronies at once leapt down from their 
  horses and prostrated themselves at the misshapen feet of the priest. I was 
  about to do likewise, but he held up his tiny, twisted hand to stop me. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Flee," he croaked, "Go now, while you can. I will deal 
  with these worms. I sense that you are squeamish, and what I am about to do 
  would turn your stomach. It is best that you begone." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Balancing himself carefully, he clapped his hands to shoo 
  my horse on its way. I dared not look back. I do not know what unutterable retribution 
  Father Gumbeetle visited upon the heads of my pursuers, but even now I often 
  lie awake at night, deprived of sleep, turning over in my mind the hideous possibilities. 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>An hour later I tied up my horse outside the Bodger's Spinney 
  Hotel and passed through creaking oaken doors into the lobby. I was peering 
  around in my dreamy, myopic way, when a uniformed man accosted me. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Yes?" he shouted. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>&quot;I'm looking for the breakfast room," I said, after 
  doing a startled little jump. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>&quot;Why?" he yelled. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>&quot;I have an appointment," I explained, </i></font><font size="+1"><i>"With 
  one of the guests." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"And?" screeched my interrogator. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>And what?, I thought. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"And?" he insisted, even louder. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"And, um, I'd like you to show me where I might find him," 
  I tried. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"And?" It was blood-curdling by now. I quaked. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"And, and ... look, would you like a tip?" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Now a second person appeared. He was older, dressed in an 
  expensive suit, had double pneumonia, and wore some sort of chain of office. 
  The uniformed man gave a little display of bows and scrapes to indicate that 
  this man was his superior.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"What's going on here?" asked the latter. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"This man says he's got an appointment, sir." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"An appointment?" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"In the breakfast room." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"An appointment in the breakfast room?" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"With one of the guests." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"An appointment in the breakfast room with one of the guests?" 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>He turned to me. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Let me get this clear," he said evenly, weighing his words, 
  "You're saying that you have an appointment in the breakfast room with one of 
  the guests?" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Yes," I replied. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Twinge," he said, turning to the uniformed man, "Get Captain 
  Freakpit down here right away. You," he said to me, "had better wait in the 
  dimly-lit room at the end of the corridor. No - don't protest! We'll get this 
  sorted out without a hint of delay. Come with me." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I followed him to a dimly-lit room at the end of the corridor. 
  We sat facing each other in complete silence. After a while he seemed to grow 
  restive, and reached over to a little cabinet, from which he took a flag. Draping 
  it over his knees, he rummaged in his pockets, produced a sewing kit, and began 
  to darn the flag, looking up at me from time to time as if to check that I was 
  still there. Eager as I was to break the silence, I couldn't think of anything 
  to say. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Then we heard urgent footsteps approaching along the corridor, 
  and after an unnecessary knocking at the door, Twinge entered the room. He looked 
  shaken. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"It's Captain Freakpit, sir," he said, "He's hanged himself." 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Throwing the flag aside, the superior jumped out of his 
  chair and dashed out of the room, making strangulated noises as if he were a 
  seagull regurgitating food for its young. Twinge hared after him. Blinking, 
  I decided to follow them, down the corridor, through the lobby, up a staircase, 
  along a passage, through a connecting-room, up another staircase, along another 
  corridor, up a step-ladder, through a hatch, into a storeroom, through a door, 
  up yet another staircase, across a landing, up another ladder, into an attic, 
  and there, swinging gently from the rafters, suspended by a length of Italian 
  hemp, I saw, bug-eyed and purple, and quite, quite dead, not "Captain Freakpit", 
  but my Uncle Nobby. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Scrimgeour henceforth devotes several dozen pages to a mawkish 
  valediction, of no interest whatsoever. Things liven up a bit when he pieces 
  together his uncle's final days, hiding out in the hotel posing as Freakpit 
  - a man he had murdered a fortnight earlier - and growing increasingly desperate 
  as his many and various enemies close in. The author then spends an unwarrantable 
  amount of time in fruitless conjecture as to why he, Scrimgeour, had been summoned 
  to the hotel. Did his uncle have an important message for him? Had he left anything 
  in his room which could shed light on the mystery? Just how much had he been 
  intending to pay for the horse? This sort of drivel goes on for so long that 
  one has to physically restrain oneself from plunging the book into a vat of 
  boiling tar. Eventually, however, it perks up again when Scrimgeour rides off 
  on his horse, heading for home...] </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>By mid-afternoon, my horse was growing tired, and I was 
  ravenously hungry, and I veered off the path and made for the tiny hamlet of 
  Mustard Parva. I hoped there to find a tavern more hospitable than the iniquitous 
  den of the previous night. I halted outside a pretty little inn called The Rhinoceros 
  & Buttercup, and, fixing a nosebag onto the horse, stepped warily inside. It 
  was a vision of wonderment, a pocket of heaven on earth. My heart burst with 
  bliss as I sat down at a dainty table. Beautiful women and handsome men thronged 
  about me, humming angelic melodies, caressing me gently, and dabbing at last 
  night's gashes and bruises with pads of cotton wool soaked in ointments, unguents 
  and lotions. Plates piled high with ambrosial foodstuffs were set before me, 
  and wherever I turned I was proferred gleaming goblets of sweet and delightful 
  drinks. A dozen shimmering, winged creatures plucked on harps, creating an unearthly 
  music. The place was festooned with exotic flowers, in pots and vases and hanging 
  baskets, their rare and delicate perfumes combining to create a heady fragrance. 
  I felt that by some strange accident I had entered upon paradise. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Scrimgeor got a bit carried away with the adjectives in the 
  above passage, but I thought you should get some idea of the awfulness of his 
  prose, if only to appreciate how much I have spared you with my ruthless editing.] 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Then the door crashed open, and a wretched, glowering man 
  strode up to the bar and beat his fists upon it. The spell, if spell it was, 
  was broken. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"I want a barrel of grog!" cried the man. Fear-struck, two 
  of the handsome men immediately scurried down to the cellars to fetch what he 
  wanted. He glared around at the company. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Whose horse is that outside?" he yelled. I begged that 
  he would not cast his eyes upon me, but my furious blushes gave me away. Coming 
  close, thrusting his face into mine, foul-breathed, he roared, "It's yours, 
  is it? Come on, you're going to help me!" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>He let out a gurgling laugh and hoisted me to my feet. The 
  barrel of grog was brought up from the cellars and he had it lashed to my poor 
  horse's back. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"You lead the gee-gee," he said, "and follow me." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I had no choice but to obey, for he presented such a terrifying 
  figure that I was sure any refusal would be met by inexplicable violence. In 
  silence broken only by the pitiful clip-clop of my horse and by occasional belches 
  from my tormentor, we headed away from Mustard Parva into the countryside. It 
  began to rain. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>An hour later, we came to a spinney, wherein a quartet of 
  thin and demented outcasts were sprawled hopelessly upon a picnic-blanket, their 
  hollow eyes fixed upon a hamper which had been heavily padlocked. They seemed 
  oblivious to our arrival, until the ferocious-looking man shouted to them. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Right, you scum, it's feeding time." </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>He took from his pocket a gigantic bunch of keys; only then 
  did I notice that the piteous crew wore fetters, from which he now proceeded 
  to free them, before unlocking the hamper. They fell upon the food like beasts, 
  while their keeper dragged the barrel of grog off my horse and rolled it towards 
  a titanic larch. He sat down and drew off a flagon's worth of grog, downing 
  it in one. Then, as if he had only just remembered my presence, he flung a coin 
  at me, and bid me leave, using words which delicacy forbids me from setting 
  down here. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Sadly reflecting upon the misery of life, I was about to 
  mount my horse when, taking a last look at the bestial picnickers, I was astonished 
  to see a young man who I could have sworn was milady's hypochondriac son. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[That is not the worst thing Scrimgeour has to say about me 
  in his Memoirs, so I shall let it pass.] </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I looked again: it was him! As he shovelled great chunks 
  of black pudding into his mouth, his eyes met mine. Dulled by whatever hateful 
  calamity had befallen him, he seemed not to recognise me. Then, perhaps because 
  I was staring at him so intently, with such astonishment, something flickered 
  in his soul, and he raised himself up, spat out the sausage of coagulated pig's 
  blood, and allowed himself a hesitant "Ag, Ag, Agamomenon?" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"It </i>is<i> you!" I cried. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>"Aga. Ag? Agamemnon?" </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>He got it right that time. Sense was sifting back into his 
  brain. While we stood like a couple of splinterheads batting our befuddled greetings 
  back and forth, the keeper - or coachman, as I was later to learn was his proper 
  title - was sinking ever more inevitably into a stupor. The grog from the Rhinoceros 
  & Buttercup was, it seemed, laced with powerful narcotics which, having lulled 
  the drinker into a peaceable slumber, would rattle him awake in two hours' time, 
  and subject him to agitation, fits, breathlessness, hallucinations and death. 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Scrimgeour and I did not witness the coachman's end, more's 
  the pity. He has taken these details from a letter I received from Mat some 
  months later. She and Nat made a rapid recovery from their bell-ringing torments, 
  and settled in Mustard Magna, where they took over the running of a phosphorous-candle 
  workshop. Bam had gone completely off his head, she wrote, but they were caring 
  for him, and hoped that he would make an eventual recovery. I never did find 
  out what became of them all, but given the number of years that have passed, 
  I suspect that the three of them are dead now, Mat and Nat and Bam, dead and 
  gone and in their graves.] </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I hauled the poor lad up onto my shoulders and carried him 
  home.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[The above sentence is an abridgement of - wait for it - two 
  hundred and forty four pages of Scrimgeour's tome. You would not believe the 
  brain-numbing detail he thinks necessary to describe such a simple matter. Basically, 
  he put me on the horse and led me through woodland glades, and the odd marsh, 
  until we turned up at the mansion in time for supper.] </font></p>
