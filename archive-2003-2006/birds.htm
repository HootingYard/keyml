<h1><font size="+2">A CATALOGUE OF 53 BIRDS</font><font size="+1"> </font></h1>
<p><font size="+1">The Godwit. Like Italo Calvino, the godwit has a seething hatred 
  of cement. It has been known to burrow. Prone to desperate sneezing, the godwit 
  chews dandelions & lacks any sense of pottery. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Wan Clump. An extraordinary bird, the wan clump is best 
  known for its habit of swooping upon film premieres attended by the likes of 
  Cloris Leachman, Troy Donahue & Tab Hunter. But not Tuesday Weld.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Third bird. The Quint. Vercingetorix Sepulveda wrote about 
  quints in one of his majestic tracts. Unfortunately, scholars have to date been 
  unable to read any of them, as his penmanship was execrable. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Lopwit. Omitted from most biographies of Ezra Pound is 
  the startling fact that he was an indefatigable trapper of lopwits. Such was 
  his mania that he was fired from the joint US-Italian Lopwit Monitoring Committee 
  in 1949.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The Tult. Sadly, the tult is an irrelevant bird.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The Fristiglip. What a joy to behold a flock of fristiglips 
  on the wing, as they set off on their annual migration from Penge to Uttoxeter! 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Snote. The following is a quotation from Eric Wheat's "Notes 
  On That Bad Man Dobson & Some Birds": "This morning on my way to church I noted 
  the nest of a snote atop the timber-framed hut in which the malefactor Dobson 
  plots his dark deeds. The nest was empty. Yet upon my return from worship, it 
  was absolutely crammed with innumerable sickly snotes." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Churter. The churter is able to mimic the sound of klaxons, 
  sirens & tocsins, but does not often do so. It feeds on dew & flax. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Arpad. Many top ornithologists contend that the arpad is 
  a kind of nightjar. Certainly its beak & wings give that impression. Arpads, 
  both in flight & roosting, have been a popular subject for recent postage stamps 
  in Finland. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Hoogoo. There are a number of interesting facts about the 
  hoogoo, a tiny bird much smaller than the wren, or even the hummingbird. The 
  hoogoo is, as far as I know, the only bird which has magnetic feet. For this 
  reason, hoogoos avoid sites such as ironworks, blacksmiths, smelting yards, 
  tin mines & other locations of metallurgical interest. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Pale Auk. Aerodynamically unsound, the pale auk is only 
  capable of flight on Wednesdays, except Ash Wednesday. Its characteristic cry 
  is a wild & deafening ululation, not unlike a hoarse muezzin. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Catsob. Catsobs were once numerous in Java & Batavia, but 
  they have been almost wiped out, possibly because they resemble stalks of wheat. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Shoveller Wreck. A shy bird, the shoveller wreck feeds 
  mainly on bags of suet eked from shipwrecks. It tears the bags open with its 
  huge, lacerating beak. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Ip. The ip is treasured by tiny & bewildered orphans, for 
  at harvest time it will roost atop unlikely clumps of foliage & sing oh so sweetly, 
  which provides a diversion in the poor unfortunates' otherwise dismal lives. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Immense Floon. The nomenclature of the immense floon is 
  one of those endlessly fascinating ornithological puzzles tabulated by the Jesuit 
  bird-fancier Father F X Curpin in his exhaustive book "Eggs & Talons". The immense 
  floon is neither immense, nor is it a floon. Nor a bird. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Plint. The plint is fractious, terrified, rotating, cowardly, 
  pompous, harsh, bilious, untenable, made of cloth & pig iron, and often found 
  in railway sidings. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Panstub. The panstub is best known as the "star" of the 
  long-running television series "Meet My Panstub!", in which members of the public 
  show their panstubs to a studio audience. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Grey Fod. Not to be confused with the vermilion fod, the 
  grey fod has been adopted as a mascot by the Association Of Icing Sugar Enthusiasts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The Chawbill. Ah yes, the chawbill. Few can forget the Sherlock 
  Holmes story in which the entire plot hinges upon the presence, or absence, 
  of a chawbill. I am one of the few. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Tump. According to the testimony of that most winsome yet 
  valiant of bird-experts, the wryly-bespectacled & quite possibly stone deaf 
  Heppenstall Pondcrack - a man of whom it was said that phantom ospreys perched 
  on his skull - the tump is "possibly the most charming bird I have ever been 
  attacked by". </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The White Sprague. The poor, poor white sprague is considered 
  a delicacy by Tasmanian bird-eaters & thus spends much of its life hiding behind 
  tractors. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Ringtod. Also known as "that bird with antennae", the ringtod 
  is capable of hearing sounds at such high pitch that laboratory experiments 
  have sent many boffins completely insane. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Twenty third bird. The Frail Grewn. The frail grewn is a wholly 
  dismal bird. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Ockfop. Fond of caster sugar & whelks, the ockfop has a 
  fiendishly complex chirp which appears to be intelligible not only to other 
  birds, but also to dromedaries, antelopes, & gnats. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Sneed. A toy sneed built from tungsten was stolen from 
  the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas just two hours before the assassination 
  of President John F Kennedy. Note that the F stood not for "Fitzgerald", as 
  is commonly supposed, but for "Fulmar" (a type of duck). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Blet. Savage blets! Numberless are the fools who think 
  the blet is a wistful, pacific bird. Not so! I bear scars today from a childhood 
  blet incident, fully recounted in my book "Eight Hundred Traumatic Bird Episodes" 
  (out of print). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Mo. If to Penge you go For the bittern show Stub not your 
  toe Nor cause yourself woe No Instead, speak low Take up thy oars and row Where 
  the stream doth flow But not the River Po And in the sunset glow Behold the 
  shy & tiny mo </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Amherst Pintpot. The feathers of the amherst pintpot are 
  truly remarkable. I have no idea why. I was once accosted upon a train by a 
  raving ornithologist who swore that this was the case, & who was I to argue? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Wert. The wert has one head, one tail, two wings & two 
  legs. I have not had time to count its talons. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Groaning Fad. The groaning fad was popular, perhaps too 
  popular, in the iconography of 1960s easy listening LP covers. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Gorey. Ajax was his name, florid his complexion, & mighty 
  were his works. Among these works, legend has it that he set free ten thousand 
  goreys caged by the bird-hating King Anaxagrotas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Curpin. The curpin is a tremulous bird which is known to 
  flock in the vicinity of hot air balloons, aerostats & grey dirigibles, especially 
  those put out of commission because their fabric is frayed, rent, or torn. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thirty third bird. The Tiny Shid. With its massive beak & laughably 
  elongated legs, the tiny shid is often the butt of larger & more elegant birds, 
  which give it chase & ridicule it in a peculiarly bird-like manner which has 
  to be seen to be believed. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Paglop. Worms form the staple diet of the paglop, a singularly 
  idle bird which can survive bewildering extremes of temperature. An ornithologist 
  once accidentally trapped a paglop in her fridge freezer, from whence it emerged 
  four months later none the worse for wear. The next day, the very same paglop 
  suffered mid-flight concussion & plunged into a huge cauldron of boiling grease. 
  Regaining consciousness three days later, the paglop simply flew away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The Booter. Booters were the favourite birds of Bruce Ismay, 
  owner of the White Star Line. The company's most famous, or infamous, ship was 
  the Titanic, the sinking of which was survived by Ismay due to his wretched 
  cowardice. Later in life Ismay, a broken man, tried to argue that the Titanic 
  had not sunk, but had in fact run aground on a grassy knoll. Yes, THAT grassy 
  knoll. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Snab. Flightless, blind in one eye, & prone to fits, the 
  snab emits a curious, frog-like croak when approached by Jesuits, bus conductors, 
  & deposed monarchs. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Illusory Wrenfig. Birdwatchers have reported increased 
  chances of success in spotting illusory wrenfigs if they first ply each other 
  with loganberry sandwiches & flasks of boiling hot custard. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Giant Clamper. Despite my vast & intimidating erudition, 
  I confess that I am wholly ignorant of the giant clamper. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Beaked Snap. Or possibly the "Beakered" snap. Experts cannot 
  agree on the correct term for this bird, & have not been helped by the astonishing 
  popularity of Gus Fang's book "How To Spell The Names Of Birds According To 
  Whim". </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Tragic Clot. Massive & unruly, the tragic clot lives on 
  the edges of cliffs, in wind tunnels, & at the bottoms of abandoned wells. It 
  is often mistaken for a loping heron, but only by those who don't know which 
  side their bread is buttered on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Tupy. Monstrous & implacable, the tupy is possibly the 
  most dangerous bird on this or any other planet. Keep away from them, for god's 
  sake. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Forlorn Punt. Quite why the forlorn punt has been included 
  in this list is beyond me. Granted, it has a beak, it has feathers, it is wingéd. 
  It is indubitably a bird, but it really is most unprepossessing. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Forty third bird. The Ectoblot. Aah, we come at last to the 
  ectoblot, fondly known as the "Rod Steiger of the Aviary". Cantankerous, doleful 
  & seldom at rest, the ectoblot's luminous crimson plumage is surely evidence 
  that God exists. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Snagger. Snaggers are a type of gull. Like all gulls, they 
  are scavengers. However, being mentally unstable, snaggers tend to scavenge 
  pointless things, like blunted pencil sharpeners & broken cotton reels. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Big Drub. What poetry lover has not felt a frisson of pure 
  delight upon encountering Gervase Beerpint's slim volume "A Toc H Lamp Sputters 
  In The Gloom"? I am thinking of the first edition, with the cover picture of 
  a big drub in her nest, feeding her cuddly chicks with scrapings from a bran 
  tub. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Old Cargpan. The following quotation is from an unknown 
  source: "That year there was an Indian summer. As a hard-nosed press reporter, 
  I had spent months tracking down the so-called "umbrella man" shown in photographs 
  from Dealey Plaza. I was getting nowhere, & I was down in the dumps. To cheer 
  myself up, I strode through buttercup-splattered fields, looking at the enormous 
  blue sky, blue, so blue. And there, blue too, almost invisible, coming in from 
  the south, was a whole flock of old cargpans. I nearly had a heart attack." 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Spavined Ack. The spavined ack is a parasitic bird. The 
  chicks attach themselves to much larger ostriches. Once attached, if they fall 
  off, they die.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The Hopeless Cork. The hopeless cork's name is a misnomer. 
  Indeed, it is one of the most optimistic of birds, possibly because it looks 
  so appealing that even those with the hardest of hearts will readily toss breadcrumbs 
  to it. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Reed Flamboise. The reed flamboise is the only bird in 
  this list to be wholly mythical. Having said that - as I just did - it is not 
  without charm. What it IS without is a sense of direction, as it habitually 
  confuses north with west, but not vice versa. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dobson's Wafer. Many is the time, strolling 'mid the fens, 
  the spire of Ely Cathedral visible in the distance, that I have taken off my 
  big woolly hat in awe at the sight of a pair of dobson's wafers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The Basinbeak. Exceedingly disagreeable, though harmless, 
  the basinbeak is the most unmusical of birds. You'll get no cheeps or chirrups 
  out of this little fellow. God knows I've tried, alternately feeding it Garibaldi 
  biscuits & holding its head under a water pump, but all to no avail. Call me 
  a fool, but I'm going to try again, probably next Monday. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Illicit Hoonjaw. Once upon a time, a little girl called 
  Minnie said to her papa, "Papa, today I was coming home from school when one 
  of my friends had an epileptic fit, a grand mal, & I was so disconcerted I made 
  a strange surprised noise, like MIP! MIP!" "Ha!" replied her papa, "That is 
  exactly like the song of the illicit hoonjaw!", for papa was a top ornithologist, 
  & he knew his onions. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fifty third bird. The Clunk. Last but not least. </font></p>
