    <h2><a class="post" href="#2004-03-31-1" name="2004-03-31-1" title="Permanent link to this day's posts.">Chrononhotonthologos</a></h2>
    
<p>For many years I believed that the most startling opening line in theatre was Ubu's “Merdre!” in Alfred Jarry's <i>Ubu Roi</i>. But no! What could better this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the opening words of Henry Carey's <i>Chrononhotonthologos</i>, spoken by Rigdum-Funnidos. The play is not unlike <i>Ubu Roi</i>, in that the title character is a greedy, bad-tempered and violent king. (It would have been a great role for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Coates">Robert Coates</a>.) The final scene leaves the stage littered with corpses - this memorable line will give you some idea:</p>

<blockquote><p>O horrid! horrible, and horridest horror! Our king! our general! our cook! our doctor! All dead! stone dead! irrevocably dead! O——-h!—— [All groan, a tragedy groan.]</p></blockquote>

<p>The play also includes my favourite musical direction, which would not be out of place at the Festival of Argumentative Music at Ülm (see 24th February):</p>

<blockquote><p>SCENE—A Bed Chamber. Chrononhotonthologos asleep. [Rough music, Viz. Salt Boxes and Rolling Pins, Grid-Irons and Tongs, Sow-Gelders Horns, Marrow-Bones and Cleavers, c. c.] He wakes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Henry Carey (c.1687-1743) also wrote, among much else, the words to <i>God Save The King</i> (or <i>Queen</i>). <i>Chrononhotonthologos</i> was so popular in its day that the title entered the language, as a synonym for “furious, violent, demanding, self-centered” (sounds just like Pa Ubu) and appeared in earlier editions of <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i>, although appears not to have made it into the <i>OED</i>.</p>

<p>You can read the play in full by clicking on the picture of Pa Ubu (for want of a picture of Chrononhotonthologos himself).</p>

<p>I've come to talk with you again. I've had a nightmare about a hen. I'd been abandoned, in my pyjamas, in a desolate fen. The hen approached me, clucking. Seldom have I heard so eldritch a cluck from a domestic fowl. I was thoroughly unnerved. In the nightmare, believing that I had awoken, I was chewing my pillow and my mouth was full of feathers and I began to choke. But I did not wake. The hen pecked at something on the ground. I was no longer in a fen. I was standing in the middle of a field splattered with buttercups, holding a big iron slab of dubious utility. I looked at it very carefully, and saw that a stanza of Emily Dickinson's had been scratched on it: <i>Its little Ether Hood - Doth sit upon its Head - The millinery supple - Of the sagacious God.</i> Now I was spectacularly terrified! The Belle of Amherst dream, that had plagued me for two decades until Dr Snap prescribed his balm and unguents, had returned to haunt me! Somehow I was conscious that I was thrashing about in my bed and yet I remained transfixed in sleep. The noise made by the hen grew louder. Knowing that “a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid”, I looked desperately around me. Though I could hear it, the hen had vanished. The iron slab weighed heavy. Now I was knee deep in water. I began to shout, echoing Edgar Allan Poe's dying words: “Reynolds! Reynolds! … Reynolds!” At the last cry, mercifully, I awoke. I jumped out of bed immediately and plunged my head into a nearby pail of icy water. Then I went to the window, and looked out at the bright morning. Rustic farmyard persons were trudging up the hill over by Bodger's Spinney. A booby and a godwit sang.</p>

    <h2><a class="post" href="#2004-03-31-3" name="2004-03-31-3" title="Permanent link to this day's posts.">The Encyclopaedia of Unnecessary Knowledge</a></h2>
    
<p>Jasper Poxhaven has claimed that Dobson had as many unrealised or aborted projects as there were published pamphlets - and we know how numerous they were! Perhaps the most ambitious of these abandoned works is the gargantuan <i>Dobson's Illustrated Encyclopaedia Of Unnecessary Knowledge</i>. From notes scrawled higgledypiggledy in various notebooks, we know that the projected work was to extend to forty thick volumes of tiny, tiny print, with upwards of twenty thousand articles containing millions of words. Some of the pieces were indeed written and appeared as pamphlets, but until recently it was thought none of the proposed illustrations were ever executed. At a Port of Tongs jumble sale, however, Mrs Gubbins' nephew happened upon a cardboard box full of detritus, buried in which were three drawings. Subjected to tremendously exciting forensic analysis by a scientist known only to Jasper Poxhaven as “man with unwashed hair”, the pictures have now been authenticated. They were drawn by Marigold Chew to accompany three of Dobson's encyclopaedia articles; alas and alack, not one of the three was ever written. We are proud to publish the pictures here, together with Mr Poxhaven's brief notes. We have given each its own Hooting Yard paragraph-break, because that's the kind of thing we do, especially on Wednesdays.</p>

<h3>BIG PÂPIER MACHÉ DINOSAURS</h3>

<p><img alt="" height="110" src="dinosaurs.jpg" width="245" /></p>
</div>

<p>It is possible that some trace of Dobson's text for this article can be found in his pamphlet <i>How And Why I Built Eight Small Pâpier Maché Brontosauruses</i>.</p>

<h3>PHANTASM OF THE PLANT-POT</h3>

<p><img alt="" height="153" src="hide.jpg" width="168" /></p>

<p>It is unclear what Dobson meant by the title of this proposed article. Ms Chew's illustation is similarly perplexing. I have applied for a grant which will allow me to devote the next four years to unravelling the mystery.</p>

<p>“Yet, was his beauty not amiable, but rather calculated to inspire terror and distrust, than affection and confidence: in fact, a bandit may be uncommonly handsome; but, by the fierce, haughty character of his countenance, the fire which flashes from his eyes, and the contempt which curls his mustachoed lip, create fear, instead of winning regard, and this was the case with Charles. One, however, of those maidens, unto whom it was the folly and vanity of his youth to pay general court, conceived for him a passion deep and pure, which in semblance, at least, he returned; but how far to answer his own nefarious purposes, for Charles Elliott was a godless young man, we shall hereafter discover.” — Miss M L Beevor, <i>The Huntsman : A Traditionary Tale</i></p>

<p>In Britain, the day after Christmas is known as Boxing Day. Curiously, the day after Pansy Cradledew Day has not been accorded its own name. A plenary session of the Hooting Yard Miscellaneous Matters Of Towering Importance Committee was convened to address the issue. It was swiftly agreed that a name for the post-Pansy day should be in some way related to “boxing”, but frantic arguments raged for minutes whether the allusion was to packaging or fighting. Some members of the committee wanted to plump immediately for Wrestling Day. They were silenced when member F X Duggleby provided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day">unassailable evidence</a> that the “boxing” referred to boxes, and had not a jot nor tittle to do with contact sports.</p>

<p>This point decided, the committee went into recess, and partook of a superb lunch of shredded watercress and boiled duckpond water, then engaged in post-prandial calisthenics (think trampolines and medicine balls). Brain scans completed, the committee members shuffled back into the Big Overwhelming Hall, with its gleaming linoleum, important-looking wallpaper, and empty birdcages.</p>

<p>The afternoon session reviewed a wide variety of boxes and packaging materials, and eventually voted between two options: Big Unwieldy Crate Day or Jiffy™ Bag Day. The latter was carried by four thousand and eight votes to six.</p>

<p>Renowned as a musician, impresario, voluptuary and habitué of tough drinking-dens in the dockyards of Marseilles, Lothar Preen was - perhaps surprisingly - a novelist of no little talent. Few of his books have had a wide readership, published as they were by small presses which were often phantom companies serving as cover for illicit &amp; reprehensible activities, the tomes themselves likely to be pulped within days of coming off the press. The time seems right for a re-evaluation of Preen's literary work, so we are pleased to present the first ever English-language summary of his prose. Click on the picture of Preen below….</p>

<p>Mister Bim bought an atlas as a birthday gift for his daughter, who was tremendously fond of geography. Without opening the big fat book, Mister Bim asked the oddly-haired shop assistant to wrap it up in colourful and exciting paper and to tie a ribbon around it. The shop assistant did the wrapping with precision and care, but then got the ribbon entangled in his odd hair, and had to use a pair of scissors to free it. Now the ribbon was not long enough to girdle the atlas.</p>

<p>“I am most dreadfully dreadfully sorry,” said the shop assistant.</p>

<p>“Oh never you mind now,” said Mister Bim, “the wrapping paper is lovely all by itself.” The paper had a pattern of interlocking hollyhocks, delphiniums, and fire extinguishers, all red and green and gold and purple and yellow and blue.</p>

<p>Mister Bim's daughter, Clytemnestra, unwrapped the atlas on her birthday three days later. She beamed and gave her papa a kiss on his hairy cheek.</p>

<p>“Oh gosh what can I say thank you so much papa!” she said.</p>

<p>We learned in the very first sentence that Clytemnestra was terrifically fond of geography. That fondness had led her to become knowledgeable, too. So imagine her disappointment when, upon close inspection, she discovered that every single one of the maps in the atlas was inaccurate. The port of Split is not in Bolivia. The world's largest lake is not just a few miles south of Swanage. Swanage itself is not spelled Swange.</p>

<p>“I will take it back to that shop and complain,” said Mister Bim.</p>

<p>“No no, papa. Let us tear all the maps out of the book and make a fire with them. Let us create a conflagration like unto the very flames of Hell.”</p>

<p>And, children, do you know something? That is exactly what they did!</p>

<p>“Vermin with wings” was the memorable phrase used by newt-fancying Mayor of London Ken Livingstone to describe pigeons. He has a point. Sometimes it seems as if nowhere in our capital city is free from pigeon shit. They're grubby birds. Even the supposedly healthy ones <i>look</i> disease-ridden. And that eerie, unholy noise they make - the soundtrack to nightmares. I know otherwise saintly people - Francis of Assisis in the making - who would gladly bludgeon, stamp on, or maim pigeons to make the world a better place. Well.</p>

<p>My theory is that our attitude to Ken's “vermin” has a lot to do with the associations - such as those above - which crowd our heads when we hear the word “pigeon”. Our ability to take an objective view of the birds is lost. Just as we would find it difficult to maintain an air of suave politeness if introduced to a woman, only to learn that her first name was Condoleezza, we cannot escape the involuntary, Lovecraftian shudderings elicited by certain words and names.</p>

<p>There is a way forward, if we are prepared - in this instance - to approach ornithological taxonomy with a devil-may-care looseness. Some breeds of pigeon have lovely names. Ever since I began to think of these shit-riddled birds as cumulets, my heart swells with pangs of joy at the sight of them, which is as it should be on this miraculous and lovely planet. And who - apart from the likes of Condoleezza Rice - could fail to have tender feelings towards a Czech ice pouter?</p>

Think of his happiness blighted for ever and her doomed to a perpetual maidenhood, harrowed with remorseful dreams of the hourly perils and horrors through which he must be passing without her, and dreading to enter an academy or picture-gallery lest a laocoon or a fury might revive apprehensions too horrible to be borne. In view of possibilities so dreadful, surely it is a duty that a man owes to his kind to disseminate the truth, if he can, about the present condition of that reptile which, crawling on its belly and eating dust and having its head bruised by the descendants of Eve, sometimes pays off her share of the curse on their heels.” — E H Aitken, <i>Concerning Animals &amp; Other Matters</i></p>

<p>On Friday 12th March we referred to Dobson's short-lived contract with Ladybird Books, which saw the publication of just one work. It has long been argued, by the indefatigable Dobson scholar Jasper Poxhaven, that a second book was planned, and - more controversially - that dust-jackets were printed for the new title so that it could be included in Ladybird's 1960 catalogue. When Dobson failed to deliver his manuscript, says Poxhaven, the proposal was quietly dropped, an erratum slip was inserted into the catalogues, and the dust-jackets were torn up and donated to the Pang Hill Orphanage for use in pâpier maché projects. All traces of the book were then lost, and it became one of the so-called “Phantom Dobsons”, those much-discussed works of which there appear to be hints and vestiges in the documentary record, yet which elude even the Poxhavens of this world.<span class="asterisk">*</span></p>

<p>Last week, however, while taking a cigarette break, the same Poxhaven was caught in a downpour and took shelter in a derelict kiosk abutting the Port of Tongs flag-and-pennant warehouse. The scholar was astonished to see, pasted to the crumbling wall of the kiosk with proprietary paste, a copy of the lost Dobson dust-jacket. Gingerly, he unpeeled it from the wall, put it in his satchel, and cycled furiously to the Dobson Building, where it is now on temporary display next to a pile of towels in the laundry room.</p>

<p>Imagine, just for a moment, that you live in ancient Latvia. Now look at today's date. Gosh! It's Kazimiras Diena, the festival which commemorates the return of the larks! Being an ancient Latvian, you know full well that larks are passerine birds of the predominantly Old World family <i>Alaudidae</i>, small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Often, you have pointed out to your ancient Latvian pals that larks nest on the ground, laying between two to six speckled eggs. Sometimes you get into arguments with your ancient Latvian next hut neighbour, who insists that most larks are fairly dull in appearance. Both of you agree, however, that their food is insects and seeds. Now, amity restored, you set off arm in arm with your neighbour for the festival.</p>

<p>“Look, Arvids,” you say, pointing to a nearby bird, “a lark!”</p>

<div class="illustration">
<div class="images">
<p><img alt="" height="140" src="lark.jpg" width="205" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Indeed it is, Egils,” says your neighbour, “But what species of lark do you suppose it is?”</p>

<p>“Well now, Arvids, I must confess I'm not entirely sure! There are so many different species of larks! Monotonous, Singing Bush, Australasian Bush, Latakoo, White-tailed, Madagascar, Kordofan, Williams', Friedmann's, Red-winged, Somali Long-billed, Ash's, Angola, Rufous-naped, Flappet, Clapper, Collared, Indian Bush, Gillett's, Fawn-colored, Rufous-winged Bush, Rusty, Pink-breasted, Degodi, and Sabota, to name but twenty five!”</p>

<p>“Egils, Egils!” replies Arvids, “Are you not forgetting the Rufous-rumped, Dusky, Archer's, Sidamo, Rudd's, Cape, the Algulhas-, Eastern-, and Karoo Long-billed, Benguela, Short-clawed, Dune, Karoo, Barlow's, Ferruginous, and Spike-heeled larks, to say nothing of the sparrow larks?”</p>

<p>“Sparrow larks, Arvids?” you ask, plaintively.</p>

<p>“Yes, Egils. Not just the Black-eared and the Chestnut-backed, but the Black-crowned and Gray-backed and Chestnut-headed and Fischer's and Ashy-crowned!”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, Arvids,” you say, “Now you come to mention it, I used to have a tame Chestnut-headed Sparrow lark.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that's what it was, Egils?” challenges Arvids, a fierce look in his blazing eyes, “Quite sure it wasn't a Bar-tailed, Rufous-tailed, Desert, Gray's, Greater or Lesser Hoopoe, Thick-billed, Calandra, Bimaculated, Tibetan, Mongolian, or White-winged lark?”</p>

<p>You are now beginning to feel defeated by your neighbour's superior knowledge.</p>

<p>“I suppose it might have been a Black or a Greater Short-toed lark, Arvids,” you whimper.</p>

<p>“Well, that's as may be,” says Arvids, “But what about the lark over there which has now taken up a perch on the branch of that lightning-struck pugton tree? Is it a Blanford's, Hume's, Lesser Short-toed, Red-capped, Asian Short-toed, Sand, Somali Short-toed, Pink-billed, Botha's, Sclater's, Obbia, Masked, Dunn's, or Stark's lark, do you think?”</p>

<p>“It's definitely not a Stark's,” you say, confidence boosted a little, “Although perhaps it might be a Dupont's, Thekla, Malabar, Sun, Tawny, Long-billed, Short-tailed, Wood, or Skylark, Arvids.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Egils! You will be telling me next it is a Japanese, Oriental or Razo skylark! Or even a Horned or Shore or Temminck's lark!”</p>

<p>“Well at least I know it's not a Magpie lark, Arvids,” you shout, “Which is actually neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant Monarch flycatcher.”</p>

<p>“I am well aware of that, Egils,” your neighbour ripostes.</p>

<p>By this time the bird, which is in fact a Crested lark, has flown away, and raindrops are beginning to fall in ancient Latvia.</p>

<p>The logophiliac barber Nuttawood Sirinuntananon used the above five sentences from Knox's pulp non-classic as the basis for a word game which he unsuccessfully marketed under the name <i>Johnfowlesopoly</i>.

<p>Taking the adjectives from Knox's passage - in alphabetical order, <i>bestial</i>, <i>big</i>, <i>debauched</i>, <i>fashionable</i>, <i>foreign-made</i>, <i>jaded</i>, <i>neurotic</i>, <i>sickening</i>, and <i>whirling</i> - players are given five minutes to compose a very short tale suitable as a bedtime story for infants. All nine adjectives must be used, but free rein is given for the rest of the text. Extra points are awarded if the word <i>plodded</i> is also included.</p>

<p>It is time once again for this popular contest, open to all readers, their families and friends. With just a week to go until Pansy Cradledew Day, the panel of judges decided to set her as the topic - or, to be more precise “a poem in praise of Pansy Cradledew written in the style of Andrew Motion”. Now there's a challenge for poetasters and versifiers! Sharpen your pencils, set to work, and send in entries by Thursday 25th March, for publication on the great day itself. See 18th December and 17th March for examples of the Poet Laureate's doggerel, and refer to <i><a href="what.htm">What Is Hooting Yard?</a></i> for some pointers to Pansy's estimable character. The winner will be sent an original Gervase Beerpint manuscript, in pink ink on blotting paper - <i>really</i>!</p>

<p>There is good news from the Pang Hill Orphanage. The philanthropist Guesbaldo Sopwith - he whose fortune derives from the Unnerving Cakes &amp; Pastries franchise - has donated six cows and a bee to the crumbling and storm-tossed institution, to bring a spark of light, albeit minuscule, into the lives of the woebegone tots. In announcing his largesse, Mr Sopwith said: “The orphans may be shabby little guttersnipes, but I had a spare half dozen cows, so after long deliberation and much chewing of freshly-picked gloxinia and harebells, I decided to let them loose in the orphanage garden, or what passes for a garden. The bee was my wife's suggestion, and a very good one, I think.”</p>

<p>My <a href="http://tinshednauticals.com/helmets.htm">diving helmet</a> is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week, on Friday afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen <i>voots</i> to a bucolic hamlet called Mustard Parva. (Curiously, there is no neighbouring village named Mustard Magna, although a rustic barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of <i>gaar</i> in the local <i>gaar</i>-pot drinking hut told me that there had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this toothless derelict said, the sizeable cluster of wooden buildings known as Mustard Magna had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them, driven insane by ergot poisoning, each bear capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling with a single thwack from its mighty paw. Two hours after the first bear lumbered across Sawdust Bridge, the village was completely obliterated. It is still shown on some maps.) Jamming my bicycle into a kiosk on Mustard Parva's Yoko Ono Boulevard, I join six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. Huddled together in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot, we discuss our diving helmets and take lamentably inaccurate minutes which are published regularly through the good offices of the <i>Mustard Parva Thing</i>, whose editor is none other than the blind cousin of Marigold Chew.</p>

<p>“Next to Rosa Whittier sat Julia Balcolm, with saddened expression of countenance and large deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper expression of melancholy in their glances than is usual to the merry age of childhood, and elicited your sympathy ere you knew her history. Julia was a cripple. She was drawn to school by an older sister with rosy cheeks, bright flashing black eyes, and a sprightly animated countenance, and carried into the school-room in the arms of her teacher, or some of the older scholars. And so she came, year after year, mingling with the merry group. But where is she now? Yon little mound of heaped up earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can but hope she who was denied the privilege of walking on earth may now soar on angel's wings. This dear child was obliged to crawl from place to place after her more favoured companions, dragging her useless perished limbs behind her. But He who careth for us knew what was best for her, and we cannot doubt His infinite wisdom.” — Abigail Stanley Hanna, <i>Withered Leaves From Memory's Garland</i></p>

<p>Dark clouds lour'd, and hailstones began to ping upon the pavement. Inside Haemoglobin Towers, Mrs Gubbins and her eighty-three-year-old colleague Daisy De'Ath were putting the finishing touches to their new software development, Pump-Action Graffix Hub 1.0, already being touted as “a harbinger” by <i>Technobilge</i> magazine.</p>

<p>“Would you care for a cup of tea, dear?” asked Daisy, noting that Mrs Gubbins was panting asthmatically and mopping her brow with a dainty handkerchief embroidered with a pattern of crocuses, hollyhocks, mealy bugs, and spurge. Daisy had always been famed for her solicitude.</p>

<p>“Ack…” gasped Mrs Gubbins.</p>

<p>“Tsk! You're getting yourself all flustered, Mrs Gubbins,” said Daisy, a little sharply, “Just because you forgot to insert a backslash into the command line for the ActiveX Pod System Tray Default.”</p>

<p>Reminded of this peccadillo, Mrs Gubbins became even more agitated, toppled off her ergonomic extruded-plastic workstation seating module, and landed on the floor, threshing about in an alarming fashion.</p>

<p>“Dearie me,” muttered Daisy to herself, and resolved at once to call an ambulance, despite the storm which was now raging outside like something from the imagination of the painter <a href="http://www.artmagick.com/paintings/painting2213.aspx">John Martin</a>. She flipped through her Rolodex looking for the telephone number of the Bodger's Spinney Ambulance Station, which was close by, but without her spectacles - which she had unaccountably left in the office kitchenette while making some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovril">Bovril</a> earlier - she was as good as blind. “One of these days I'll forget my own head!” she chuckled, in her fluting croak.<span class="asterisk">*</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile a stream of drool was flowing from Mrs Gubbins' thin-lipped mouth, and her head was turning green …</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="mark">* NOTE :</span> Pedantic readers may argue that a croak cannot be fluting, but they have not heard Daisy De'Ath speak. Oh, and by the way, you will be pleased to know that Mrs Gubbins made a full recovery, before an ambulance arrived, by dint of the first aid skills of Matilda Choctaw (so spritely for a ninety-one-year-old!) who skipped into the office at the ellipsis above.</p>

<p>Yesterday we celebrated Punter Hoonjaw's centenary. There are those who would argue that the author of <i>Invasion Of The Vapid Ones</i> and <i>The Tharg From Planet Icke</i> does not deserve to be remembered. No one, however, can cavil at our decision to draw attention to an event that occurred in London two hundred and sixty four years ago today. Indeed, its contemporary relevance is uncanny. On 17th March 1740, Henry Fielding - author and magistrate - using the splendid pseudonym Captain Hercules Vinegar, issued a court summons against the Poet Laureate, Colley Cibber, accusing him of the wilful murder of the English language.</p>

<p>Is there in 21st century London an officer of the law with the wit to follow Captain Vinegar's example? I have had stern words to say about the present Poet Laureate before (see 18th December). But Lemsip-slurping Andrew Motion has now surpassed even his own previous doggerel with <i><a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,1160976,00.html">A Song For Jonny</a></i>. Read it and weep.</p>

<p>Now dry your eyes, for Pansy Cradledew has a theory. “Could it be,” she asks, “that Motion is brilliantly undermining the anachronistic, monarchist post of laureate by writing deliberately atrocious twaddle? Consider the evidence. You referred in December to his poem about a ”dapper hall“ and a ”ball“. In this latest poem we find more balls. Read the last line of the new one carefully. I think the poet - if that's the word - is trying to tell us something.”</p>

<p>When he wasn't rescuing fallen women or devising theories about Ancient Grecian colour blindness (see 2nd March), William Ewart Gladstone enthused about Atlantis. He was so infatuated with Ignatius Donnelly's book <i>Atlantis, The Antediluvian World</i> (1882) that he begged the Treasury for funds to mount an expedition of discovery, having decided that the Azores were the mountain peaks of the lost continent. The cabinet refused to let him have any money for this harebrained scheme, displaying a level of judiciousness which would not go amiss today.</p>

<p>“It is bad luck to carry a spade through a house … It is bad luck to travel with a priest; this idea seems to me of Spanish importation; and I am inclined to attribute a similar origin to the strange tropical superstition about the banana, which I obtained, nevertheless, from an Italian.

    <h2><a class="post" href="#2004-03-16-1" name="2004-03-16-1" title="Permanent link to this day's posts.">Punter Hoonjaw</a></h2>
    
<p>On <a href="jan04.htm">31st January</a>, we had cause to mention the science fiction author Punter Hoonjaw, in a copy of whose potboiler <i>Attack of the Zargons from Planet Git</i> was found the anonymous “Captain Cake” manuscript to which Dobson devoted so much impenetrable verbiage. There are those who say that Hoonjaw (1904-1993) is a justly neglected figure, but today is the centenary of his birth, and here at Hooting Yard we wish to mark it.</p>

<p>Given that he died an octogenarian, it is surprising to learn that Hoonjaw's active career as a writer lasted just six years: his first published story, <i>Dick Dazzle And The Intergalactic Toothpaste Horror</i>, appeared in <i>Inexplicable Yarns Magazine</i> in 1937. Following the publication of his novel <i>The Fiendish Plasma Goo From Outer Space</i> in 1943, Hoonjaw lapsed into silence, and wrote not another word in the half-century until his death. Yet between those two landmarks, he was one of the most prolific writers in history. The sci-fi expert Dr Gavin Foddal, when attempting to produce a <i>catalogue raisonée</i>, estimated that Hoonjaw wrote over seven hundred full-length novels, eighty-odd novellas, and an astonishing four thousand, two hundred and ninety seven short stories. Today, not a single one of the millions of words he wrote is in print. Perplexingly, one will search in vain in secondhand bookshops for any of his work, and the original manuscripts - written in longhand with a fat fountain pen in exquisite copperplate - were all destroyed. In 1957, the by now ex-author set fire to the warehouse in which they were stored as part of an insurance scam involving a gang of ruthlessly violent Bolivian thugs and a mysterious figure known only as “Henry”. That this may have been the self-styled “Doctor” Henry Kissinger, later to become President Nixon's National Security Adviser, is clearly a load of flapdoodle.</p>

<p>The paperback which harboured the “Captain Cake” text has itself vanished from a filing cabinet in the Dobson Building on the Blister Lane Bypass. It is a most curious state of affairs.</p>

    <h2><a class="post" href="#2004-03-16-2" name="2004-03-16-2" title="Permanent link to this day's posts.">Dobson's Leech Mishap</a></h2>
    
<p>Dobson was one of the few pamphleteeers of the 20th century who still took seriously the mediaeval theory of the Four Bodily Humours. To remind readers who have forgotten, and inform those who don't know, here is a commendably concise paragraph from <i>“Humorous” Dobson</i>, an unpublished essay by Marigold Chew:</p>

<blockquote><p>Taking the Aristotelian elements in turn, the theory was as follows: earth is reflected in the body as black bile, air as yellow bile, fire as blood, and water as phlegm. From these derive the terms melancholic, choleric, sanguine and phlegmatic. Dobson never deviated from his belief that the theory was fundamentally correct. He tended towards melancholy.</p></blockquote>

<p>And, it should be said, he was so convinced that he also subscribed to the related practice of bloodletting with leeches. Dobson was rarely ill, but when he was, he had a devil of a time trying to find a doctor who would treat him as he wished. On his 61st birthday, suffering from an excess of black bile, he was in luck - or so he thought. An “alternative therapist” had opened their doors just down the road. Dobson presented himself and demanded leeching. He was shown into a back room and lo!, leeches were applied to his spindly legs. Unfortunately, the quack used leeches of the genus <i>Helobdella (Glossiphoniidae)</i>, rather than <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>. The latter is, as its name implies, the medicinal leech. It is a quaint, dark cylinder which has thirty three body rings, five pairs of eyes, several pairs of testes and two suckers, one at each end of its body. The head sucker searches and penetrates while the tail sucker holds fast to the host.</p>

<p>The result of the wrong type of leech being used was so vile that I shall not repeat it here. Dobson was lucky to survive, but he did, thank the Lord. If you decide to have your blood sucked by leeches, take this helpful anatomical diagram of <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i> with you. You will be able to check that your practicioner is using the correct type of leech, and can rest easy.</p>

<p>I must make a confession. Here in the Haemoglobin Towers branch office, where the website is put together by a team of volunteers from the Bodger's Spinney Home For The Bewildered, The Withered &amp; The Fraught, there has lain neglected in a damp corner a bulging sack full of letters, all of which are pleas from readers who seek urgent advice on their jars. I can offer no satisfactory excuse for having ignored them for so long. Much as I would like to throw blame upon our temporary janitor, the defrocked papal nuncio ex-Monsignor Shudderyhead, I cannot do so. With his hacking cough, boils, and seeming unwillingness ever to wash his hair, he makes an easy target, but despite his numberless crimes we make every effort to bolster his self-esteem. Only last week Mrs Gubbins gave him her soiled copy of one of David Icke's books about extraterrestrial lizard people, and the crones in the ActiveX Plug-In Division have been saving him their boiled sweet wrappers for a month. But enough office gossip! Here, with apologies for its lateness, is the jar advice so many readers have been waiting for:</p>

<p>It is vitally important to keep all your substances in separate, labelled jars. Nothing good can come of mistaking your turps for your suet, or vice versa. It can also help to arrange your jars in alphabetical order, to wit: blubber, crusts, curd, dew, grease, orts, pips, spume, ullage, vapour, whey. (This of course is only an example, as you may own an entirely different set of substances.)</p>

<p>I trust that will suffice.</p>

He had a steel dagger fitted with a diamond-studded, carved gold hilt, to stab himself. He had especially spun a rope of gold and silk, to strangle himself.

<p>My name is Maud Abdab. I am the woman who ate blood oranges with Enver Hoxha. We sat together in uncomfortable beach chairs, without speaking. My Albanian was rusty, and I was in awe, and he saw I was in awe, and he relished my awe. Juice from the blood oranges dribbled down our jaws. From the discomfort of his beach chair, Enver Hoxha directed my attention to the left. I looked, and saw a rowing boat, and the rowing boat's oars. The oars were too small for the rowing boat - or - the rowing boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at Enver Hoxha. After a pause, he rose, and pulled from his pocket a length of gauze. When he went, he shook my hand, but he did not let fall the gauze. He spoke then. He said he had to go and draft some new Albanian laws. I recall nothing more.</p>

<p>“What in the name of heaven is Kurt Chodd prattling on about?” asks reader P. N.

This lack of verisimilitude ruined the lecture for me, and I am sure for many other readers.” Well: Mr or Ms Cowper is clearly not familiar with James Forbes' <i>Oriental Memoirs (1813-15)</i>, where we find this:</p>

<p>“The Banian hospital at Surat is a most remarkable institution; it consists of a large plot of ground, enclosed with high walls, divided into several courts or wards, for the accommodation of animals; in sickness they are attended with the tenderest care, and find a peaceful asylum for the infirmities of age. At my visit, the hospital contained horses, mules, oxen, sheep, goats, monkeys, poultry, pigeons, and a variety of birds, with an aged tortoise, who was known to have been there for seventy-five years. The most extraordinary ward was that appropriated to rats, mice, bugs, and other noxious vermin. The overseers of the hospital frequently hire beggars from the streets, for a stipulated sum, to pass a night among the fleas, lice, and bugs, on the express condition of suffering them to enjoy their feast without molestation.”</p>

<p>Edward Gibbon, author of <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, was possibly the greatest writer of footnotes who ever lived. Here is a fine example of his art: “According to Julius Africanus, the world was created on the first of September - an opinion almost too foolish to be recorded.”</p>

<p>By inserting that “almost”, of course, Gibbon gets away with recording a wonderfully foolish opinion, and by doing so preserves it for us. We include it here in the hope that readers will contribute further foolish opinions, past and present, to create the Hooting Yard Pantheon o' Preposterousness. And yes, I know that there are many, many sites on the web devoted to such zaniness, but only at Hooting Yard will you find Edward Gibbon and Julius Africanus sharing a space with a photograph of black-caped, sepulchral-voiced brain guru Tony Buzan.</p>

<p>Seldom referred to these days, the so-called Beerpint Scandal<span class="asterisk">*</span> of 1977 is worth revisiting. Dennis Beerpint (brother of the poet Gervase) tells the story himself, in this previously unpublished memorandum, hurriedly scribbled on a piece of blotting paper and deposited in a credenza located in the boiler cupboard of the Museum of Moral Turpitude in Lewdbag.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hundreds of outraged citizens threw pebbles at me in the streets after I announced, in the pages of the <i>Tungsten Railings Digest</i>, that I had never been to the theatre, that wild horses, nor indeed any other savage beasts of the field, would fain drag me to the theatre, and that I had no intention of going to the theatre, ever, full stop, end of, BAM! When, every evening, I kneel down to lavish praise upon my Maker, my most earnest prayer is that icy claws shall hug me to the bosom of Death rather than that I be propelled through the gaudy doors of the playhouse. Is this so grave a crime that I should be pelted with missiles? I can only surmise that the hot-headed reaction of the townsfolk was occasioned by my tenure, for many long years, as drama critic of the <i>Weekly Shackle</i>. Of course I had never seen any of the thousands of productions I reviewed in its august, if tatty, pages. Given an assignment by my editor, I would note down the play-title on a scrap of paper, place it under my pillow, and <i>dream</i> it. I ask you, humbly - is that so wrong?</p></blockquote>

<p class="footnote"><span class="mark">* NOTE :</span> Given the decade in which it occurred, it is a wonder that this scandal was never called “Beerpintgate” (see “Nixon”, 26th February).</p>

<p>Reader Tim Thurn has complained that recent mentions of the film person Melvin Gibson, and more particularly his absurd <i>The Passion Of The Christ</i> (see 3rd &amp; 10th March, &amp; <i>passim</i>), indicate that I have lost sight of the supreme importance of Kevin Costner to world cinema. Fear not, Tim! I may not have prostrated myself before my Costner-shrine of late, but I have not been idle.

    <h2><a class="post" href="#2004-03-13-3" name="2004-03-13-3" title="Permanent link to this day's posts.">A Guide to Pointy Town : Part Two</a></h2>
    
<p>Yesterday we listed some of the things Pointy Town is famous for. Yet it is no Utopia. For instance, you will find in the town no trace whatsoever of quaintness, wry euphonium rehearsals, toffee, yoghurt, ululating idiots, ornithological paraphernalia, athletics, sawdust, dockyard flamboyance, gutters, hedgerows, jugglers, kissing lovers, zealous x-ray-eyed cadets, &amp; “Visigoth”-brand nougat munchies. But who needs any of those things when there are great architectural marvels to be seen? One of the most striking and gigantic buildings in Pointy Town is the Old Wretched Flophouse. The principal front on the land side is considerably more than one-third of a Javan mile in length, and its wings, in depth, extend six hundred and seventy two feet, down to the edge of the Big Frightening River, this noble watercourse forming the fourth side of the quadrangle. Within the three sides (the Big Frightening River and two wings) are ranges of parallel buildings, which form the magazines, artificers' shops, mast and boat houses, offices, &amp;c.; and in the area within these are four slips for building the largest, and two for the smaller class of Tugboats of Pointlessness. The whole of the outer range of buildings consists of lamentable suites of rooms, and long and filthily ornamented galleries, filled with the natural history and curiosities collected in every part of the globe, and brought by the different navigators which Pointy Town, of late years, has sent forth on discovery. In one room are assembled all the different nautical and mathematical instruments; in another all the models of toy brazil nuts of different nations and different eras; in another a complete library connected with every branch of both human and inhuman knowledge. The library's most treasured item is the manuscript of the first draft of Sepulveda's inane <i><a href="bogenbroom.htm">Lines Written Upon First Listening To ‘Dr Bogenbroom’ by Jethro Tull</a></i>.</p>

<p>We last drew attention to Sir Isaac Newton on 16th December last year. Here is a further anecdote. Passing swiftly over the fact that his name is an anagram of “ironic swans eat”, we ought also celebrate his powers of concentration. When his mind was fixed upon some knotty mathematical problem, as it so often was, he had great difficuly bestirring himself in the mornings. He was known to begin dressing, get one leg inside his breeches, then sit back down on the bed, lost in thought for hours upon hours. A proper caution, in other words.</p>

<p>“He was nothing if not superlative: his diatribes, now culminating in a very extravaganza of hyperbole - now sailing with loose wing through the downy, witched, Dutch cloud-heaps of some quaintest tramontane Nephelococcugia of thought - now laying down law of the Medes for the actual world of to-day - had oft-times the strange effect of bringing back to my mind the very singular old-epic epithet, <i>aenemoen</i> - airy - as applied to human thought. The mere grip of his memory was not simply extraordinary, it had in it a token, a hint, of the strange, the pythic - nay, the sibylline. And as his reflecting intellect, moreover, had all the lightness of foot of a chamois kid, unless you could contrive to follow each dazzlingly swift successive step, by the sum of which he attained his Alp-heights, he inevitably left on you the astounding, the confounding impression of mental omnipresence.” — M.

<p>As we reported on Tuesday, today sees Snow White's tiny friends the seven dwarves adopting new names as part of a long-overdue rebranding exercise (see 9th March). Inspired by their example, we have decided to rebrand Hooting Yard itself. Readers are invited to send in suggestions, bearing in mind that in the corporate world exciting, vibrant and dynamic new identities are invariably limited to one word, usually ending in <i>-A</i>, and probably in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1152163,00.html">fake Latin</a> - think Aviva, Consignia, Engenda and so on. We will also be chucking out that so, so fussy “Implausible” emblem at the top of the page and replacing it with a simple swirly design, similar to the superb examples shown here:</p>

<p>This familiar phrase, which appears in the quotation from M. P. Shiel above, was also the title of one of Dobson's more readable works, and the only one to find a publisher in his lifetime. (All those pamphlets of his were, of course, cranked out on Marigold Chew's dilapidated printing press.) During the early 1950s, after spending some time as a pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard instructor at the Pang Hill Orphanage, Dobson became interested for the first time in writing pedagogic works for urchins. The early attempts were not a success. In a burst of ludicrous enthusiasm, he produced a series of ten “Tracts For Tinies” (including the now justly-admired <i>Hideous Execution Practices Of The Blood-Drenched Corsairs</i>, <i>Ten Easy Steps To Grooming Your Cormorant</i>, and <i>My Nightmares About Emily Dickinson</i>), but sales were few, and most of the copies ended up being used as hot air balloon ballast. Late in 1958, however, a janitor who worked for Ladybird Books picked up a copy of <i>A Brief &amp; Bewildering History Of Helsinki</i> in a charity shop, read it with glee, and showed it to one of the firm's editors, who immediately tracked down the elusive pamphleteer. Commissioned to write a book for the Junior Science series, and given <i>carte blanche</i> regarding his subject-matter, Dobson scribbled down this tremendous text in just three hours. Sadly, it is now out of print.</p>

<p>Pointy Town lies just south of the Port of Tongs, and is famous for its amusing biscuits &amp; cakes, dustbin exhibitions, ferocious geese, horrible icing-sugar jewellery, kaleidoscopic lettuce museum (never open), public quacking recitals, squalor, tortoises, utopian vinegar works, &amp; xanthous (yellow) zanies. The few squares that existed in Pointy Town before the revolution were used as ostrich colonies and horse laundries rather than, as they are today, places of lasciviousness and grotesquerie. The Triumph of Marmalade Square, in particular, fenced round with a rude wooden railing, interrupted by lumpish brick piers at intervals of every half-dozen yards, partakes more of the character of a pond than a parterre; and as for Kevin Costner Square, it has very much the air of a sorry cow-yard, where blackguards are to be seen assembled daily, playing at husselcap up to their ankles in mire.</p>

<p>The rest of today's content is food-related, for some reason, so this seems an appropriate item to include. When George Nevil, brother to the Earl of Warwick, was installed as the Archbishop of York in 1470, he arranged a banquet for the nobility, gentry and clergy, as was the custom. Here is a list of what they ate (spellings <i>sic</i> throughout) :</p>

<p>300 quartrs of wheat, 300 ton of ale, 104 ton of wine, 1 pipe of spic'd wine, 80 fat oxen, 6 wild bulls, 300 pigs, 1004 wethers, 300 hogs, 300 calves, 3000 geese, 3000 capons, 100 peacocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids, 2000 chickens, 4000 pidgeons, 4000 rabitts, 204 bitterns, 4000 ducks, 400 hernsies, 200 pheasants, 500 partridges, 4000 woodcocks, 400 plovers, 100 carlews, 100 quails, 1000 eggets, 200 rees, 4000 bucks and does and roebucks, 155 hot venison pasties, 100 dishes of jellies, 4000 cold venison pasties, 2000 hot custards, 4000 ditto cold, 400 tarts, 300 pikes, 300 breams, 8 seals, 4 porpusses.</p>

<p class="editor">(For a definition of Chewism, see 2nd March)</p>

<p>The subject of today's harangue is the preparation of soup, so pin back your nasty fat little purple ears and listen carefully. The following directions will be found generally applicable, so that there will be no need to repeat the several details each time. In any case, I will distribute written notes later, and this time I am feeling magnanimous, so they will be legible. Seasonings are not specified, as these are a matter of individual taste and circumstance. Some people think I am overfond of very, very hot mustard, and thus blame me for everything from trivial lip-burns to years spent in a lazaretto - pah! Some from considerations of health or otherwise are forbidden the use of salt. Sissies. In such cases a little sugar will help to bring out the flavour of the vegetables, but unless all the members of the household are alike, it had best not be added before bringing to table. Anyway, at first glance salt and sugar look almost identical, so one ruse is to dim the lanterns or to light a batch of blubber-candles, the fumes from which will be acrid enough to divert your diners' attention. Where soup is to be strained, whole pepper, mace, &amp;c., is much preferable to ground, both as being free from adulteration, and giving all the flavour without the grit. Some soup recipes, of course, call for the inclusion of handfuls of grit, dust, and pavement grease, so bear that in mind. The water in which cauliflower, green peas, &amp;c., have been boiled, should be added to the stock-pot, but as we are now recognising that all vegetables should be cooked as conservatively as possible - that is, by steaming, or in just as much water as they will absorb, so as not to waste the valuable salts and juices, there will not be much of such liquid in a ‘Reform’ menage. Any water you do use is best brought to kitchen in an iron pail direct from the closest duckpond, for springs and even wells harbour all sorts of tiny little beasties with far too many legs, and even wings, whereas all such creepy-crawlies will have been removed from a duckpond by the eating habits of hungry and none-too-fastidious ducks. A stock must therefore be made from fresh materials, but as those are comparatively inexpensive, we need not grudge having them of the freshest and best. Try never to eat anything that is more than five years old. Readers of Thackeray will remember the little dinner at Timmins, when the hired chef shed such consternation in the bosom of little Mrs Timmins by his outrageous demands for ‘a leg of beef, a leg of veal, and a ham’, on behalf of the stock-pot. Those who do not know their Thackeray will wonder what in heaven's name I am talking about, but the point is plain: every kitchen must have a bound set of Victorian novels - wrapped in greaseproof paper - to avert the unexpected.</p>

<p>“I do not think it is wise to wear bracelets when playing unless they are plain and tight to the wrist. Although you might not think it, ornaments, however small, can and do get in your way. I remember one match that was entirely lost because of the presence of a gold curb bracelet with a small dangling chain attached. Putting up her hand to adjust a hairpin, the owner did not know that the chain had caught on to her fringe-net, and, bringing her hand down quickly, the fringe-net and most of the hairpins were dragged from her hair. The result was that the player, who might easily have left the court and fixed up her hair again firmly, adjusted it as best she could, her hair blowing about in all directions. In between every stroke she had to clutch wildly at stray portions that blew across her face and into her eyes. This diversion naturally upset her game, and I think that was the last time she wore a bracelet in court.” — Mrs Lambert Chambers, <i>Lawn Tennis For Ladies</i> (1910)</p>

<p>On Monday 8th March we published one of Dobson's so-called “ghost photographs”, thought to be the only extant picture of those tiresome yet strangely attractive twins, Istvan &amp; Zoltan, whose madcap escapades have thrilled a handful of readers. But Dr Ruth Pastry has news for us. “I was clearing out one of the leisure-and-relaxation module-compartments in my space-age home,” she writes, “to make room for my new collection of <i>The Passion Of The Christ</i>-related <a href="http://www.sharethepassionofthechrist.com/gifts.asp">merchandise</a>, when I came upon a little book called <i>Jimmy At The Seaside</i> by Neville Main, published by the Brockhampton Press in 1949. Imagine my surprise when, leafing through it, my eyes fell upon some pictures of twins who bear a striking resemblance to your dashing duo. They may be given different names in Mr Main's ur-text, but surely these are Istvan and Zoltan <i>avant le lettre</i>? I claim my five pounds.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="mark">* NOTE :</span>I am careful to write “I think, reasonably well-known” as opposed to the magisterial “everybody knows”. A particularly splendid example of the latter appeared in the <i>Guardian</i> recently. A. S. Byatt wrote: “<i>most people know</i> [Sir Charles Sherrington's] description of the waking brain as ‘an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern<i>…’”</i> (my emphasis). If readers have favourite examples of such absurd pomposity, please send them in.</p>

<p>Yesterday's quotation of the day, Wilma Salisbury's terrific description of a dance by Father Bob VerEecke, included a link to a page about the terpsichorean Jesuit. What was lacking, however, was a photograph of our hero in action. Here he is:</p>

<p>Is nothing sacred? In this age of pointless but seemingly obsessive rebranding, news reaches us that Snow White's diminutive pals, the seven dwarves, are to be given new names. From next Friday, apparently, they are to be known as Wretched, Spiteful, Incontinent, Wistful, Lippy, Rancorous &amp; Preening.</p>

<p>On a related note, Pansy Cradledew has brought to my attention the growing debate over the identity of the “Eighth Dwarf”, akin to the long-running argument as to who exactly deserves the title of the “Fifth Beatle”. Pansy hopes to bring us the latest news on this important subject very, very soon.</p>

<p>“As an introduction to the Jesuit priest's choreography, Kahn performed <i>Overwhelmed</i>, an expressionistic evocation of a dark emotional state that suggested sacred dance only in a few gestures of prayer. Set to a recording of prepared piano music by John Cage, the brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying in a heap as the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Kahn had disappeared, and <a href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v6/d11/vereecke.html">VerEecke</a> had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the floor, he cried out to God, ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded his fists against the rear wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed in lyrical movements by ten dancers who had learned the graceful choreography in VerEecke's workshop.” — Wilma Salisbury, dance critic, <i>The Plain Dealer</i> July 1999</p>

<p>A number of readers, enamoured of the thrilling adventures of Istvan and Zoltan chronicled here over the past week or so, have asked if any pictures exist of the duo. Long hours rooting and rummaging in the Hooting Yard Photographic Library, (to be found on the mezzanine floor of the Big Damp Building pitched so perplexingly on the lethal slopes of Pang Hill), eventually brought to light one of the notorious “ghost photographs” taken by Dobson.

<p>An unsigned email arrives from (I surmise) New York City, regarding the Father Hopkins SJ adaptation <i>The Tall Nun Goes West</i> (see “Films On Television”, 5th March):</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Sir : Please provide air date and time for the referenced feature. While I agree with you that it is the most faithful of the many Hopkins adaptations, I have a deep personal affection for <i>The Cheery Beggar</i>, despite the unfortunate miscasting of Aldo Ray as the Polynesian sponge-diver. Thank you for your consideration.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am afraid that the schedule has not yet been finalised, so cannot say when this majestic piece of cimema will be shown. One point about <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/122/61.html">The Cheery Beggar</a></i> which my anonymous correspondent does not mention is that the film marked the screen debut of the great child Method actor Tad Wensleydale. At the age of seven, he had already taken Broadway by storm with his performances as Shylock, Lear, Mrs Miniver, Torquemada, Mike Hammer, Louis Pasteur and Clytemnestra, among others. Six years later, on the cusp of teenage hobbledehoyhood, his meteoric career was effectively over, but not before he had appeared in a second Hopkins adaptation, <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/122/29.html">Felix Randal The Farrier</a></i>. Wensleydale was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the “big-boned and hardy-handsome” title character, stone dead at the beginning of the film, but the award that year went to Ricardo Montalban.</p>

<p>The four hundred men and women of the Blister Lane Cormorant Patrol brandished their pencil sharpeners, toffee apples, and inaccurate atlases as they reached the peak of the tor after marching all day. Below them, beyond the pig huts, the curiously-stained bridge, and the abandoned swimming baths, they were just able to see, shrouded in mist, the famous (or infamous) Wotan and Tantalum ponds, so dried up after successive droughts that they were now little more than puddles.</p>

<p>“Onwards!” cried Captain Federico ‘Gwyneth’ Paltrow, undisputed leader of the Cormorant Patrol and the man whose stupendous energy had helped it thrive even through such lean times. Seldom has a puny and diminutive physiognomy been so misleading.</p>

<p>And so began their descent. Three quarters of the way down, the newest recruit, fey young Daisy ‘Ricardo’ Montalban, stopped in her tracks, pointed, and yelled out: “Look! Look! Something with a beak and feathers!” And indeed, as they peered through the enshrouding mist, the others saw it too, perched on the branch of a withered pugton tree sprouting hopelessly on the banks of one of the ponds, or puddles. Excitedly, they began running, capering and gambolling down the muddy slope of the tor. But as they closed upon their prey, they realised it was not a cormorant at all. It was a little bittern.</p>

<p>“What do you know of literature?” sneered Zoltan, but Istvan was already rummaging in his brother's satchel. Moments later, he held triumphantly aloft a dog-eared paperback. Zoltan eyed him closely. “Your arm shot up in phallic conspiracy,” he quoted. Istvan examined the curiously stained cover of the book. He was severely myopic. Eventually he managed to discern the title: <i>Pestilence &amp; Farm Implements - Number 8 in a Series of Dog-Eared Paperbacks by Vercingetorix Sepulveda</i>.</p>

<p>“May I borrow this?” he asked.</p>

<p>As a service to all those readers who have a bullfinch to feed, I have consulted that invaluable reference work <i>Enquire Within Upon Everything</i> (1856 edition), which tells us: “Old birds should be fed with German Paste No. 2, and occasionally rape-seed. The Germans occasionally give them a little poppy-seed, and a grain or two of rice, steeped in Canary wine, when teaching them to pipe, as a reward for the progress they make. Bird organs, or flageolots, are used to teach them.” Didn't the Victorians use a lot of commas? Note that no information is given about the feeding of young bullfinches, which I would have thought would be a more urgent matter. If you are one of the few readers who does not have a bullfinch to feed, but wish to obtain one, this is what they look like:</p>

<p>Now, having installed your bullfinch in suitable accommodation, you will be wondering where to get your German Paste No. 2. I recommend Joseph Sterry &amp; Sons, “manufacturers of poor man's plaisters and German Paste”, 2 Mint Street (opposite St George's church) Borough High Street, London SE. Last time I checked, in 1873, the business was thriving. While you are there, pick up some of their poor man's plaisters in case your bullfinch pecks you with its fierce, lacerating beak or attacks you with its talons, which it may well do if you mistakenly feed it German Paste No. 1, or indeed No. 46.</p>

<p>The television arm of the Hooting Yard Foundation is currently developing a drama series based on the detective stories of F X Duggleby. Fans of his fiction will know that DCI Gruesome is irascible, vain, hirsute, and mordant, that he keeps a colony of fruitbats in his attic, and that he invariably solves his crimes using a ratiocinative method similar to - if not wholly plagiarised from - <a href="http://www.rollins.edu/olin/archives/shiel_frm.htm">M. P. Shiel's</a> Prince Zaleski. (Duggleby goes so far as to have the DCI spend long hours loitering in a gazebo.) His assistant, Sgt Turgid - highly-strung, imprudent, bedizened, yet valiant, a keen <i>Reader's Digest</i> reader - bears a striking resemblance to Frankenstein's monster. In the first book of Duggleby's series, <i>The Murder of the Murderous Murderer</i>, he is described thus: “His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. His voice, when at last he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.” I mention this because the casting director is completely stumped, having failed to persuade veteran Eric Sykes and Melvin “Mad Max” Gibson to take the lead roles. If readers have any suggestions, please send them in at once. Shooting begins next week.</p>

She held up, this time, a cluster of slender, spindly cigars. She showed him, flung them from her. Her hands went up overhead, quivered there aloft, vibrant with doom and malediction, calling the blind skies to witness.

<p>By popular demand, here is another of Marigold Chew's pieces of “interstitial prose” (see yesterday's item on Chewism). This one is a little moral fable taken from <i>Stories From Life</i> by Marden Vice Harden:</p>

<p>Brethren, we find ourselves, today, in a village in China. Perhaps some would feel inclined to ridicule rather than applaud the patience of a poor Chinese woman who tried to make a needle from a rod of iron by rubbing it against a stone. We may scoff and laugh and snicker like rude and common folk do. It is doubtful whether she succeeded or not, but, so the story runs, the sight of the worker plying her seemingly hopeless task, put new courage and determination into the heart of a young Chinese student, who, in deep despondency, stood watching her. He was a spindly little chap whose greatest joy was to be found in the study of industrious leaf-cutter ants, of which he kept teeming thousands in a glass case in the parlour of his pneumonia-racked mother. Because of repeated failures in his studies, ambition and hope had left him. He could think only of ants. Bitterly disappointed with himself, and despairing of ever accomplishing anything, the young man had thrown his books aside in disgust. He had even cast aside a five-volume encyclopaedia devoted entirely to the world of insects; ants alone filled the pages of books one and two. Put to shame, however, by the lesson taught by the old woman, he gathered his scattered forces together, went to work with renewed ardour, and, wedding Patience and Energy, became, in time, one of the greatest scholars in China. Actually, that's not strictly true: he ended up sewing cummerbunds-for-export in a Batavian sweatshop. When you know you are on the right track, do not let any failures dim your vision or discourage you, for you cannot tell how close you may be to victory. And even if every damned thing goes wrong, there is no shame in being a deluded pauper. Have patience and stick, stick, stick. Then stick a bit more. It is eternally true that he “Who steers right on / Will gain, at length, however far, the port. / Though he be seasick all the way / And quite bereft of thought.”</p>

<p>“The kam, as if approaching the Yarta of Erlik and coming into his presence, bows, brings his drum up to his forehead, and says, ‘Mergu! mergu!’ Then he declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts; this is meant to indicate that Erlik is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his yurta. The frightened kam leaps backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Erlik's throne. After this performance has been gone through three times, Erlik speaks: ‘Winged creatures cannot fly hither, beings with bones cannot come: how have you, ill-smelling black beetle, made your way to my abode?’” — M.

<p>Chewism is the popular name for the fictional method pioneered by Marigold Chew (1955-1998).

Sometimes the results were startling: the poet Gervase Beerpint, in one of his all too rare critical essays, said that Chew's story based upon a chapter from George Bernard Shaw's “nonage novel” <i>The Irrational Knot</i> was “as good as anything by Ayn Rand, and makes John Fowles read like a grumpy cod-mystic of limited talent”. (Inevitably, Beerpint received a grumpy letter from Fowles within days of the essay being published. Wisely, he cast it into a furnace.) As a special treat for Hooting Yard readers, we have gained permission to reprint one of Marigold Chew's uncollected stories, <i><a href="albatross.htm">The Albatross</a></i>, where her “interstices” appear within a short sketch of the same title by Augustus Earle which was included in <i>The Book of Enterprise &amp; Adventure; Being an Excitement to Reading for Young People</i> (London, 1851).</p>

<p>“These palliards be called also clapperdudgeons. These go with patched cloaks, and have their morts with them, which they call wives. And if he go to one house to ask his alms, his wife shall go to another; for what they get, as bread, cheese, malt and wool, they sell the same for ready money; for so they get more [than] if they went together. Although they be thus divided in the day, yet they meet jump at night … Farther understand for truth that the worst and wickedest of all this beastly generation are scarce comparable to these prating palliards. All for the most part of these will either lay to their legs an herb called spearwort, either arsenic, which is called ratsbane. The nature of this spearwort will raise a great blister in a night upon the soundest part of his body. And if the same be taken away, it will dry up again and no harm. But this arsenic will so poison the same leg or sore, that it will ever after be incurable. This they do for gain and to be pitied. The most of these that walk about be Welshmen.” — Thomas Harman, <i>A Caveat or Warening, for Commen Cursetors Vulgarely Called Vagabones</i> (1566)</p>

<p>Alert readers will have noted the appearance (thrice) of a crest or emblem at the top of the page. This is taken from the pamphlet <i>Dobson's Heraldic Dossier</i>, a bewildering little booklet which the great pamphleteer had specially printed on an antique press which Marigold Chew discovered rotting away in a blizzard-swept tent on the outskirts of Helsinki during her tour of Finland. Dobson writes in hallucinatory prose about what he calls “the new heraldry” which he planned to usher in, and provides a number of examples of his own devising, though it is thought that the artwork itself was completed by Chew. For a large-scale copy of <i>Implausible</i>,click on the further example below:</p>

    <h2><a class="post" href="#2004-03-01-2" name="2004-03-01-2" title="Permanent link to this day's posts.">Zoltan &amp; Istvan</a></h2>
    
<p>“Crikey!” exclaimed Istvan. He had just noticed that a fierce gigantic elephant-like being was thundering towards him, &amp; that he was almost certain to be crushed to death within the next few seconds.</p>

<p>“Have you ever read <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i>?” asked his twin brother Zoltan, who was reclining in a hammock safely out of the path of the fierce gigantic elephant-like being. Zoltan was speaking through a shiny red loudhailer.</p>

<p>“Cease taunting me with seventeenth century prose!” cried Istvan, “Is it beyond your puny wits to see that I am about to be flattened by a fierce gigantic elephant-like being?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn't worry about that,” drawled Zoltan, “It will be stopped in its tracks by the mahout who is at this very moment careering across the verdant greensward bent on intercepting it.”</p>

<p>“Pah!” expostulated Istvan, his terror momentarily submerged beneath contempt for his brother, “Next you will be telling me that you are ignorant of the two salient features of all mahouts: one, they are unhinged, and two, their skills are defunct in this our brave new century.”</p>

<p>The fierce gigantic elephant-like being had meanwhile halved the distance between itself &amp; Istvan, whose now renewed terror rooted him to the spot. That spot, incidentally, lay a yard or two from a chance splash of campions in bloom, their vivid colours a pleasing contrast to the bracken, furze &amp; bindweed run riot o'er the greensward as far as the human eye could see. Zoltan removed his pince-nez, &amp; holding them with strange delicacy in his mighty, hairy fist, he said: “That's as may be, o twin, but I can assure you that this particular mahout is both hinged &amp; funct.”</p>

<p>And he was proved correct, for just then the said mahout leapt astride the fierce gigantic elephant-like being &amp; coaxed it to a halt.</p>

<p>It's well known that Sherlock Holmes described his arch enemy Moriarty as “the Napoleon of crime”. Less celebrated, but far, far more evocative, is his description of Dr Watson as “the stormy petrel of crime” (see <i>The Adventure of the Naval Treaty</i>, and also see below):</p>
