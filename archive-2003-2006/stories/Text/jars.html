<h1>Advice On Jars</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is vitally important to keep all your substances in separate, 
  labelled jars. Nothing good can come of mistaking your turps for your suet, 
  or vice versa. It can also help to arrange your jars in alphabetical order, 
  to wit: blubber, crusts, curd, dew, grease, orts, pips, spume, ullage, vapour, 
  whey. (This of course is only an example, as you may own an entirely different 
    set of substances.)</p>
