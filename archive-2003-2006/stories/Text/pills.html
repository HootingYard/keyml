    <h1>A Brief Note About Pills</h1>
    
    <p class="noindent">Please do not confuse toad-pills - those "tiny pink miracles 
      of batrachian well-being" as Dobson called them in his engaging pamphlet 
      <em>How I Counted All The Toads In Scandinavi </em> (out of print) - with other 
      sorts of pills, not least those of Lockyer, whose tomb in Southwark Cathedral 
      commemorates his genius:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="verse">
        <p>Here Lockyer lies interr'd, enough : his name<br/>
          Speaks one hath few competitors in fame ;<br/>
          A Name soe Great soe Generall'e may scorne<br/>
          Inscriptions wh doe vulgar tombs adorne :<br/>
          A diminution to write in verse<br/>
          His eulogies wh most men's mouths rehearse.<br/>
          His virtues and his PILLS are so well known,<br/>
          That envy can't confine them under stone.<br/>
          But they'll survive his dust and not expire<br/>
          Till all things else at th'universall fire.<br/>
          This verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him safe<br/>
          To future times without an Epitaph :
        </p>
        <p>Repair'd Octobr 1741<br/>
          Deceast Aprill ye 26th Anno Do : 1672 Aged 72
        </p>
