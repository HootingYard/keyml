<h1>(Footnote on Belshazzar)</h1>
  <blockquote>
<p>Rembrandt's source for this painting, the Old Testament Book 
  of Daniel (5: 1-6, 25-8), tells of a banquet Belshazzar, King of Babylon, gave 
  for his nobles. At this banquet he blasphemously served wine in the sacred vessels 
  his father Nebuchadnezzar had looted from the Temple in Jerusalem. </p>
<p>Rembrandt shows the moment when a divine hand appeared and 
  wrote on the wall a phrase only Daniel could decipher. When transliterated the 
  inscription reads: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation: 
  'God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; you have 
  been weighed in the balances and found wanting; your kingdom is given to the 
  Medes and Persians.' That very night Belshazzar was slain. </p>
<p>Rembrandt derived the form of Hebrew inscription from a book 
  by his friend, the learned Rabbi and printer, Menasseh ben Israel, yet mistranscribed 
  one of the characters and arranged them in columns, rather than right to left, 
  as Hebrew is written. The picture, painted in about 1635, is an example of Rembrandt's 
  attempt to establish himself as a painter of large-scale Baroque history paintings.
