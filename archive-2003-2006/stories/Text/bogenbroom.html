    <h1>Lines Written Upon First Listening to <em>Doctor Bogenbroom</em> by Jethro Tull</h1>

    <p class="byline">A poem by Vercingetorix Sepulveda</p>

    <div class="verse">
      <p>
        O! Savage &amp; vile &amp; pink &amp; bloated thing! <br/>
        Curs'd uncanny globule of despair! <br/>
        Monstrous, too! So pale &amp; shuddering! <br/>
        Its gleaming talons clawing at my hair! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hast this being come t' announce my doom? <br/>
        Its head is like a chaffinch or a gull. <br/>
        It has been sent by Doctor Bogenbroom, <br/>
        Invoked by minstrel-wizards Jethro Tull.
