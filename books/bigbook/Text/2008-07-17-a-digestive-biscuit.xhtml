  <p>Following on from <a href="2008-06-21-corncrake-project.xhtml" class="internal" title="Corncrake Project"><em><strong>Corncrake Project</strong></em></a>, the first in a series of what might be called Hooting Yard's <em>Readers' Digest</em>-style digested news stories, here is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2071537/Woman-arrested-with-knife-%27saved-by-sausage%27.html" class="external"><strong>another one</strong></a>.
