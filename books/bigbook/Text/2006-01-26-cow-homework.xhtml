  <h1>Cow Homework</h1>
  <p>Yesterday's item <em>A Series Of Unfortunate Cows</em> had a homework assignment attached. This is just one initiative in the development of a new Interactive Hooting Yard Project. Reader Mark Williams had the good grace to send his homework in, and I reprint it below to give the rest of you some idea of the standards we are looking for.</p>
  <p>Note to Mark&nbsp;: Your handwriting is lopsided. In future, please ensure that the express turbomotorcycle courier arrives at Haemoglobin Towers before midnight.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Here is Mark's homework:</p>
  <p>1. A cow is not wise, thus on that premise cows will inadvertently engender unfortunate situations as proved by the four classic unfortunate situations that you have written about. So, ultimately I would require the best possible quality of life, that is, the least amount of suffering. Therefore I would not want to get myself into unfortunate situations. The inevitable swift painless death of a cow standing on some railway tracks is my choice. This is dependent on the scruples of the helm man…hmmmm…crikey, there is a possibility of an unfortunate painful death resulting from a partial maiming caused by the driver braking and thus not fully killing the cow due to the reduced speed. I am confused now.</p>
  <p>2. I would not laugh, instead, I would bury my head in the ground. However, due to the unfortunate nature of a cow I would, no doubt, stick my head in a field full of Caper Spurge otherwise known as stinking hellebore. The Dumville family used this foul smelling plant to rid moles from the English countryside. Fascists.</p>
  <p>3. I would tip the cow like this: “Don't laugh in the face of misfortune, little cow<span class="asterisk">*</span>, otherwise you could end up with more than you bargained for.”</p>
  <p>4. On the assumption that an eldritch soul-transfer had taken place then it is likely that this soul would have the same intention as me in the answer to question one. Thus, I would mow the cow down with my train at the highest speed possible.</p>
  <p>I hope this is not too late.</p>
  <p><span class="mark">* NOTE&nbsp;:</span> Mark appears to think that cows are tiny. They are not. One wonders if he has got a grip of the subject at all.</p>
