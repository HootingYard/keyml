  <h1 id="post-5579">O Say Can You See</h1>
  <p>O say can you see only indistinct blurs? As you squelch through the marsh on your way to the pig sty.</p>
  <p>In the cold misty dawn you are poked at with twigs by the sprites of the marsh who are strident and captious.</p>
  <p>You're not wearing your specs. You're disorientated. You sink to your knees in the vapours of marsh gas.</p>
  <p>The sprites harry you, and they hector you too. You spill all the pigfeed out of your tin pail.</p>
  <p>Such a dawning as this, on a wet Wednesday morn, it does make you wonder why e'er you were born.</p>
