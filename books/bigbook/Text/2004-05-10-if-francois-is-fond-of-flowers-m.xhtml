  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“If Francois is fond of flowers, M. Perrin has the same penchant for hydraulics and the camera obscura; he draws, he makes jets from the Seine, by an ingenious piece of machinery of his own invention; while he was retouching his syphon, I asked permission to turn over the register, where suicides are ranged in two columns.“—Leon Guzlan, <em>A Visit To The Morgue At Paris</em></p>
