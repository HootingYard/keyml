  <h1 id="post-6745">Cupcake O’ The Future</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I hesitate to tread into that realm where blogging and cupcakes collide, as it is territory where Brit at <strong><em><a href="http://thinkofengland.blogspot.com/search/label/cupcakes" class="external">Think Of England</a></em></strong> stands proudly alone, far above the petty doings of mere mortals.</p>
  <p>I do think it worth mentioning, however, that next month I shall be taking a trip to Mortlake, where I shall be served with a nice cup of tea accompanied by a cupcake emblazoned with the Monas Hieroglyphica of the Elizabethan magus Dr John Dee. See below, for the mystic symbol, if not the cupcake, which I assume has yet to be baked. A full report on this extremely sensible outing will follow in due course.</p>
