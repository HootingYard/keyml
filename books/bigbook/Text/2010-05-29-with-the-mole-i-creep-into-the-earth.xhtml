  <h1 id="post-4546">With The Mole I Creep Into The Earth</h1>
  <p>Yesterday I went to a concert given by <strong><a href="http://www.williamddrake.com/" class="external">William D Drake</a></strong>. One of the songs he and his band performed was a splendid setting of a sonnet by Michael Drayton (1563–1631), a poet of whom I confess I had never heard before. Here is a portrait, and the poem:</p>

  <p>When first I ended, then I first began;</p>
  <p>Then more I travelled further from my rest.</p>
  <p>Where most I lost, there most of all I won;</p>
  <p>Pinèd with hunger, rising from a feast.</p>
  <p>Methinks I fly, yet want I legs to go,</p>
  <p>Wise in conceit, in act a very sot,</p>
  <p>Ravished with joy amidst a hell of woe,</p>
  <p>What most I seem that surest am I not.</p>
  <p>I build my hopes a world above the sky,</p>
  <p>Yet with the mole I creep into the earth;</p>
  <p>In plenty I am starved with penury,</p>
  <p>And yet I surfeit in the greatest dearth.</p>
  <p>I have, I want, despair, and yet desire,</p>
  <p>Burned in a sea of ice, and drowned amidst a fire.</p>
