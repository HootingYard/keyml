  <h1 id="post-6881">Scenes Of Domestic Bliss, No. 1</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It was an overcast morning in July. Pansy Cradledew was up and about at an ungodly hour. Some time later, her inamorato woke up, and, glugging his morning coffee, asked:</p>
  <p>“So what have you been up to so early in the day, my sweet, my darling dear?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, I pulled the head off a bat,” replied Pansy.</p>
  <p>Her inamorato spluttered a mouthful of coffee and almost choked, until it became clear that the bat in question was not some flesh and blood and sinew pipistrelle, but a model bat made from terracotta-coloured modelling clay. Pansy, it transpired, had fashioned a figurine of the hideous bat god Fatso, his “look” based on the equally hideous bat god <strong><a href="06881_scenes_of_domestic_bliss_no_1.xhtml" class="internal" title="Fatso Versus Camazotz">Camazotz</a></strong>, and the removal of the head was a temporary measure to expedite the drying and setting process. Nonetheless, her crack o’ dawn activity led to the conversational exchange reported, causing much merriment and the splitting of sides.</p>
