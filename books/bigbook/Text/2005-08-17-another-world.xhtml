  <h1>Another World</h1>
  <p>It is appropriate that today's quotation is taken from an “esoteric” book entitled <em>Another World</em>, as I have received conclusive information that Hooting Yard is read by at least one being from another world. Whether that world is the Star City of Montalluyah I do not know.</p>

  <p>I confess to being thoroughly overexcited at the fact that Hooting Yard has an extraterrestrial being as a reader, and a little glum that he, she, or it only dropped in once. If anyone knows how I might communicate with alien worlds, short of joining the Star Fellowship (see <em>Wedd Star</em>, 10th <a class="internal" href="2005-02-01-hooting-yard-archive-february-2005.xhtml">February 2005</a>), please drop me a line. If I can work out how to send my thought-beams to an unknown world, that lone alien reader may return, and perhaps be joined by others.</p>
