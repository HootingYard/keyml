  <h1>Aguirre, The Wrath Of Candleford</h1>
  <p>Exciting news from the BBC. Werner Herzog has been persuaded to direct a forthcoming episode of twee bucolic period drama <em>Lark Rise To Candleford</em>. This follows the unprecedented global success of the <strong><a href="2010-11-29-rustic-radio.xhtml" class="internal" title="Rustic Radio">scene</a></strong> where the peasant sprawled in the drainage ditch recites Captain Beefheart's <em>Old Fart At Play</em>.</p>
  <p>Herzog is currently working on the screenplay for his episode, which is likely to feature either a conquistador and a gang of howler monkeys laying waste to Dorcas Lane's Candleford post office, and/or an attempt by a deranged impresario to build an opera house in the squalid village of Lark Rise.</p>
