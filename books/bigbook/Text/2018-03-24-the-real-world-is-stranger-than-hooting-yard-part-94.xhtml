  <h1>The Real World Is Stranger Than Hooting Yard (Part 94)</h1>
  <p>I have occasionally muttered in exasperation when the world o' Hooting Yard is described as “surreal” or “weird”, given that the so-called real world is often so much stranger. Just the other day, there was that business about the (all too real) <a href="2018-03-17-the-tremendous-gert.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Tremendous Gert"><strong>Valeska Gert</strong></a> anticipating the (wholly fictional) world-famous food-splattered Jesuit.</p>

    <p><em>Neil Armstrong (no, not that Neil Armstrong) reviewing</em> Secret Pigeon Service: Operation Columba, Resistance and the Struggle to Liberate Europe <em>by Gordon Corera in the latest edition of</em> Literary Review:</p>
    <p><em>Among others, we meet Viscount Tredegar, an occultist and friend of Aleister Crowley. He was for a time in charge of the section of the army that supplied MI14(d) with birds but was eventually court-martialled for gossiping about Columba's work. His defence cited his unhappy childhood and the fact that his mentally ill mother had built herself a large bird's nest in the living room and sat in it wearing a beak.</em></p>
