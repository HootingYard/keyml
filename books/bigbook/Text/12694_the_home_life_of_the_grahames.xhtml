  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">The marital life of the Grahames became uncosier by the year. “Elspeth seldom got up before eleven, often went to bed in her clothes … Much of the time she spent on her divan, sipping hot water. She ate practically nothing and mouse-nests proliferated in the larder ; she put Kenneth into special underwear which was only changed once a year. It is perhaps not surprising that he took a long solitary walk every day.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">John Sutherland, <em>The Lives Of The Novelists</em> (Profile Books, 2011), quoting from (I think) a 1959 biography of Kenneth Grahame by Peter Green.</p>
