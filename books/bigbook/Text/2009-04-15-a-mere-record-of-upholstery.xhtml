  <h1 id="post-2293">A Mere Record Of Upholstery</h1>
  <p class="noindent"><em>Aladdin</em> is possibly the best-known of the <em>Tales Of The One Hundred And One Nights</em>, fodder for panto and Disney and even for film-makers in the Soviet Union. I have never read the story myself, in any version, and I doubt that I ever will, now that I have chanced upon Thomas De Quincey's judgment of it.</p>
  <p>In <em>Infant Literature</em>, he wrote: “in <em>Aladdin</em>, after the possession of the lamp has been once secured by a pure accident, the story ceases to move. All the rest is a mere record of upholstery; how this saloon was finished today, and that window on the next day, with no fresh incident whatever”.</p>
  <p>That said, it's an interesting narrative technique, if one has a particular readership, such as upholsterers, in mind. But I don't.</p>
