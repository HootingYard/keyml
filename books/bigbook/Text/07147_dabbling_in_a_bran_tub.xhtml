    <p class="noindent">This week in The Dabbler, my cupboard contains <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/08/a-bran-tub-of-bittybobs/" class="external">a bran tub of bittybobs</a></strong>. To give you some idea of what I am talking about, here is the Oxford English Dictionary definition of bran-tub (with a hyphen) which, as you can see, leads directly to its definition of bran-pie (also with a hyphen), a term I confess is entirely new to me:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="blockparagraphs">

        <p> <strong>bran-tub</strong> <em>n.</em> = <em>bran-pie</em> <em>n.</em>; also <em>fig.</em></p>
        
        
        <p>1858 C. Parry&nbsp;in E. Parry&nbsp;<em>Mem.</em> (1870) vii. 173&nbsp;&nbsp; It quite reminded me of the bran-tub itself as I unpacked each separate article.</p>
        
        <p> 1909 <em>Westm. Gaz.</em> 22 Apr. 8/2&nbsp;&nbsp; Sideshows will contain the ever-popular phrenologist's tent and bran-tub.</p>
        
        
        <p> 1963 <em>Times Lit. Suppl.</em> 26 Apr. 313/3&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a mathematical bran-tub.</p>
        
        
        <p> <strong>bran-pie</strong> <em>n.</em> a tub full of bran with small gifts hidden in it to be drawn out at random, as part of festivities at Christmas, etc.</p>
        
        <p>1877 <em>Cassell's Family Mag.</em> May 377/1&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last division of the tent we had‥a bran-pie.‥ The bran-pie was an oblong washing-tub‥filled with bran, in which were hidden‥small articles.</p>
        
        <p> 1889 <em>Peel City Guardian</em> 28 Dec. 7/4&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes what is termed a ‘bran pie’ is employed‥for storing the presents in.</p>
        
        
        <p> 1904 <em>Daily Chron.</em> 27 Feb. 3/2&nbsp;&nbsp; The bran-pie‥is the receptacle of second-rate presents: gifts not quite showy enough to be displayed upon a Christmas tree.</p>
        
        
        <p> 1916 <em>Daily Colonist (</em><em>Victoria, Brit. Columbia</em><em>)</em> 4 July 4/4&nbsp;&nbsp; All sorts of seasonable refreshments will be served and the blue ribbon girls will have an attraction in the form of a bran pie.</p>
        
        
        <p> 1931 V. Woolf&nbsp;<em>Waves</em> 236,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think more disinterestedly than I could when I was young and must dig furiously like a child rummaging in a bran-pie to discover my self.</p>

    <p class="noindent">I am disconcerted to learn, however, that neither bittybob (without a hyphen) nor bitty-bob (with a hyphen) is defined in the OED. Can such things be?, to quote Ambrose Bierce.</p>
