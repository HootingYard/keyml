  <h1 id="post-362">Evil Stalks The Land</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It is easy to laugh at the English judiciary, with all those bewigged judges who seemingly know nothing of the wider world outside their chambers. But they know how to turn a phrase, those judges. With <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7210688.stm" class="external"><strong>Nicholas Van Hoogstraten</strong></a> back in the news, it is worth recalling that many years ago he was described in court as “a self-styled emissary of Beelzebub”. I wouldn't be surprised if he's used that phrase ever since when filling in his “Occupation” on documents.</p>
