  <h1 id="post-15084">A Postcard From The Last Century</h1>
  <p class="noindent">In 1982 I spent much of my time making postcards, which I sold for a pittance to eager punters from what would now be called a pop-up stall in Norwich. Below is an example of the sort of thing I was doing.</p>
  <p>The source material for both words and images was a huge pile of <em>National Geographic</em> magazines from the 1950s and 1960s acquired from various second-hand bookshops. To create the captions I employed a cut-up technique akin to that used by William S Burroughs and David Bowie, but far more amusingly than either of them ever did, particularly the former, a tedious gun-toting drug-addled uxoricide.</p>
  <p>Younger readers may find it difficult to fathom, but in Norwich in 1982 it was well nigh impossible to find an affordable colour photocopying facility. I thus sent my originals to my friend <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Curious-Cookbook-Sparrows-Historic-Recipes/dp/0712358633" class="external">Peter Ross</a></strong> in London, and Peter organised the copying and sent me the results by post. I then employed scissors and glue to mount the hysterically funny images on to card, ready for sale to East Anglians.</p>
  <p>I think Peter is still in possession of most of the original artwork, but this one came to light the other day. The captions read as follows:</p>
  <p><em>Undimmed by Death</em></p>
  <p><em>Who were they?</em></p>
  <p><em>In this convivial land, trendy youngsters like Walter And Jorg searched the ground for clues.</em></p>
  <p>Walter and Jorg are each identified by separate name captions.</p>
