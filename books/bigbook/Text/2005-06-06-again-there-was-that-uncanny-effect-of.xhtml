  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Again there was that uncanny effect of diabolical intelligence. The hissing, whirling ball of purple fire followed its predecessor… They heard a muffled explosion this time. Lurid tongues of light speared from the window, dancing like an aurora borealis. The room inside looked for a moment to those staring from the darkness like the mouth of some fantastic inferno such as the hand of a Doré might have depicted. Above the noise of the concussion they heard a single, horrible cry. Then blackness descended and the night seemed to close in, bringing silence with it. The voices of the detectives grew hushed with amazement and the awe of the unknown.” — Paul Chadwick, <em>Doctor Zero</em></p>
