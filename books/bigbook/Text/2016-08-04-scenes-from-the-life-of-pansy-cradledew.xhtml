  <p><em>Scenes From The Life Of Pansy Cradledew</em> is our popular series in which, Boswell-like, we document exciting scenes from the life of Pansy Cradledew. Today, we turn our attention to Wednesday the third of August 2016.</p>
  <p><em>Wednesday, 3 August 2016</em> <em>[aetat. 51]</em>. It so happened that on the morning of this day, Ms Cradledew found herself sitting next to the head of a horse enshrouded in cellophane. The horse-head remained <em>in situ</em> for the entire morning, though shortly after the clock struck noon it was removed, and taken away, she knew not where.</p>
