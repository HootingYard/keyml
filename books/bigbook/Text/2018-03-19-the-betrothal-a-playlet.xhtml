  <h1 id="post-16371">The Betrothal&nbsp;: A Playlet</h1>
  <p><em>Characters:</em></p>
  <p>GAEL ANDERSON, the bride-to-be</p>
  <p>ANDREW CLUTTERBUCK, her suitor</p>
  <p>IAN ANDERSON, minstrel &amp; father of Gael</p>
  <p><em>Scene: A mansion in the countryside</em></p>
  <p>Enter GAEL and ANDREW</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: Oh darling! I am so thrilled at the prospect of our imminent betrothal!</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: As I am too, my poppet. <em>[A dark cloud passes over his brow.]</em> But first I must ask your father for your hand in marriage. I fear he may place hurdles in our path.</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: It is true he can be an exacting man, darling, but I feel sure you will win him over.</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: Well, we shall find out soon enough. Hark! I hear him approach!</p>
  <p>Enter IAN ANDERSON</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: Hello Gael, hello young fellow-me-lad.</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: Hello Papa!</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: Hello Ian … I may call you Ian?</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: No you may not. Address me as J-Tull Dot Com, as in the title of the 1999 album release by my rock band.</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: Oh … okay.</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: <em>[Laughing]</em> But I jest with you! By all means call me Ian. And what brings you to my country pile on this lovely summer's day, sonny?</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: Well, I, er, um …</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: Go on, darling, ask him!</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: I come to ask for the fair and dainty hand of your daughter in marriage.</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: I see. And are you a worthy suitor?</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: He is, Papa, he is!</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: To be worthy of my daughter, a man must be able to play the flute while standing on one leg. Can you do that, son?</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: <em>[Crestfallen]</em> I'm not sure.</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: But Papa, Andrew has other special skills. He has fought many zombies, and has a string of triumphs over the walking dead!</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: Really? I have not heard anything so preposterous since <em>Crest Of A Knave</em>, the 1987 album release by my rock band.</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: Yes, really, Papa! Have you not seen the post-apocalyptic television drama <em>The Walking Dead</em>? Every week, Andrew gives those zombies the what-for!</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: My poor sweet child, you are confusing Mr Clutterbuck here with Andrew Lincoln, the zombie-battling star of that show.</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: Be it known that I <em>am</em> Andrew Lincoln! Born a Clutterbuck, I dropped that foolish surname when I embarked upon my glittering thespian career.</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: Is that so? Well then, I give my consent!</p>
  <p>GAEL&nbsp;: Oh thank you Papa!</p>
  <p>ANDREW&nbsp;: Thank you, J-Tull Dot Com sir!</p>
  <p>IAN&nbsp;: Let us celebrate by singing a few snatches from <em>Aqualung</em>, the 1971 album release by my rock band.</p>
  <p><em>They sing &amp; wassail.</em></p>
  <p><em>Curtain.</em></p>
