  <h1>Cost O’ Cows &amp; Horses</h1>
  <p class="noindent">John Fernely, a successful Victorian dauber who lived in Melton Mowbray, charged ten pounds to paint a portrait of a horse, but only seven pounds for a portrait of a cow. Were these costs fair? Would you have been prepared to pay more for a cow picture than a horse painting? If not, why not? What do you think was going on in Fernely's head when he set these prices? Comments please.</p>
