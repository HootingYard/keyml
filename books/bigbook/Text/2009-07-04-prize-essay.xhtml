  <h1 id="post-2572">Prize Essay</h1>
  <p>Every five years, Hooting Yard awards a prize for the best entry received in our Essay Competition. As ever, the subject matter of essays is in some wise related to potatoes. Entries must be at least ten thousand words in length, couched in majestic sweeping paragraphs, and executed in gorgeous handwriting. This year's title is as follows:</p>
  <p>“Potatoes were no food for a dying woman.”—Hannah Maria Jones, <em>The Life Of A Murderer</em> (1848). Discuss, with particular emphasis on potatoes and dying women.</p>
  <p>The closing date is tomorrow.</p>
