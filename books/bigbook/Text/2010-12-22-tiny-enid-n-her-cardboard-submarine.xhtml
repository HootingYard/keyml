  <p class="noindent">This photograph has yet to be authenticated by the Tiny Enid Photographic Authentication Bureau, but appears to show a tot who could possibly be Tiny Enid standing next to her cardboard submarine. That the plucky little fascist had a cardboard submarine we already know. Remember that stirring line in the <em>Memoirs</em>, “I had a submarine and it was made out of cardboard”?</p>
