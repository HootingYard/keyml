  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Another blessed ‘passing-over’ I viewed was that of a little girl on earth crippled by an accident in which she was run over by a heavy dray, and which necessitated the amputation of her leg. Her mother had ‘died’ shortly before this accident, and she was left in the charge of people who had no kindliness, were hard and callous, her one sympathetic companion a little spaniel pup. Without this dear dumb brute, existence would have been well-nigh unbearable. A neglected chill resulting in pneumonia happily finished off this poor little human fragment and relegated her to a sphere where love and happiness awaited her. The mother, attended by a band, of which I was a member, watched at the ‘death’-bed of this sweet little creature, and when the last breath of life had been drawn in that frail body, helped the luminous soul to ascend to a fairer setting.” — Lilian Walbrook, <em>The Case Of Lester Coltman</em></p>
