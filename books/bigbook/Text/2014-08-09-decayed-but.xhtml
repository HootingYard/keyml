  <p>Ruthie Bosch (who designed the cover of <em>By Aerostat To Hooting Yard</em>) is in regular receipt, from a Canadian correspondent, of Victorian newspaper and magazine clippings. These are primarily illustrations, but bits and scraps of surrounding text are often still attached. Ruthie tells me that one recent acquisition included the splendid phrase</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now as I belong to a “decayed”, though not yet phosphorescent family</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I think I ought to do something with that.</p>
