  <p class="noindent">Here is an (anonymous) review on Amazon of <em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Keys-Shorter-Potted-Brief-Lives/dp/1472115236/" class="external">Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</a></strong></em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">This is a near-perfect example of a gift book that keeps on giving. Small and appealing, with a well-organised, encyclopaedia-style layout and charming portrait illustrations. The text is a delightâ€”easy to dip in and out of, and full of facts that are perplexing, bizarre, amusing and sometimes poignant. What really sets it apart, however, is Frank Key's unerring eye for the deliciously obscure and his unique sense of humour, which runs like a seam of precious metal through the book. An unexpected treasure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">I need hardly remind you lot that you are under instructions to buy copies of the book for everybody you know. While you're about it, you should add your ha'ppenyworth to the online reviews at Amazon. You know it makes sense.</p>
