  <h1 id="post-88">Wrecks</h1>
  <p class="noindent">There is huge excitement at Bodger's Spinney as we look forward to this weekend's annual Spinney Wreck Competition. Rival teams have been preparing for months, in utmost secrecy, their re-enactments of <a href="http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/Classic%20Poems/Hopkins/the_wreck_of_the_deutschland.htm" class="external"><em>The Wreck Of The Deutschland</em></a> and <a href="http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Poetry/Wreck.htm" class="external"><em>The Wreck Of The Hesperus</em></a>. As ever when the Jesuits meet the Hiawathas, there is a sense of age-old blood feud, and volunteer ambulance-based medicos wearing special armbands will be on the alert from before daybreak.</p>
  <p>Old Farmer Frack's cows will be mooching in a nearby field to add an air of bucolic charm, and Mrs Gubbins will again be wearing the referee's <em>chapeau</em>. In an exclusive pre-contest interview she told our reporter, “I am hoping things pass off with due decorum, but I have made sure we have enough tourniquets on site this year. No one wants to see a repeat of the time we had to send urchins scampering off across the hills to Old Ma Bagshaw's Bandage Shop.”</p>
  <p>Mrs Gubbins was made referee-in-perpetuity after she single-handedly sent packing a gang of rogue Opium-Eaters who tried to sabotage the contest with a wholly inappropriate, because shipless, re-enactment of <a href="http://library.beau.org/gutenberg/2/0/0/9/20090/20090-h/20090-h.htm" class="external"><em>The Household Wreck</em></a>.</p>
  <p>The latest odds are available from the illegal gambling den behind the illegal butcher's shop on the plaza.</p>
