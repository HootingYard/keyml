  <h1>Overseas Jesuit</h1>
  <p>Mention of Dr Charlotte Bach's tragically unrealised <strong><a href="2011-03-13-aztec-fun-for-all-the-family.xhtml" class="internal" title="Aztec Fun For All The Family">Aztec board game</a></strong> summoned to memory a family favourite from my childhood. Overseas Jesuit was a board game in which one rolled the dice and moved one's counter across various dark and benighted continents, converting the heathen hordes by fire and sword. So simple were the rules that the game was suitable for even the tiniest young Catholic.</p>
