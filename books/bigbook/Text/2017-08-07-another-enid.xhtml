  <p><em>The latest correspondence in the Hooting Yard postbox:</em></p>
  <p>Dear Mr Key&nbsp;: Your brief list of <a href="2017-08-06-the-pauper-and-the-princeling-and-the-pea.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Pauper And The Princeling And The Pea"><strong>children's authors named Enid</strong></a> brought back happy memories. I was surprised, however, that you made no mention of my own favourite, Enid Blytmyfire. Who can forget her series of books about Little Jim, the shamanic singer, poet and counterculture icon, who is revealed as merely a drug-addled alcoholic who dies in a bathtub in Paris?</p>
