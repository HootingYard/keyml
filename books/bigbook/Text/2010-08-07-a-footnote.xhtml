  <h1>A Footnote</h1>
  <p class="noindent">In the <strong><a href="2010-08-03-reading-and-listing-and-quiz-question.xhtml" class="internal" title="Reading And Listing (And Quiz Question)">potsage</a></strong> a few days ago regarding the keeping of a list of books one has read, I completely forgot to mention one “voracious reader” whose list goes back over forty years to 1968 and is available for all to see online. Yes, 'tis <strong><a href="http://www.artgarfunkel.com/library/list1.html" class="external">Art Garfunkel</a></strong>, golden-voiced croonperson and thespian. When you are done checking to see which books you and “The G” (as he is called on one section of his site) have both read, you may wish to investigate his transcontinental walks (of both the USA and Europe). Oscar Wilde famously said that all Art is quite useless, but clearly he was not referring to Mr Garfunkel.</p>
