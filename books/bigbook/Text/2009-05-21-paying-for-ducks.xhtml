  <h1 id="post-2465">Paying For Ducks</h1>
  <p>While I have fallen silent due to blockage of the inspirational funnels in my cranium—about which more later—the media has been merrily obsessed with MPs and their expenses. I have been following all the details with far more intensity than is advisable for a sensible person. Today, I wish simply to leap to the defence of the Tory <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5357568/MPs-expenses-Sir-Peter-Viggers-claimed-for-1600-floating-duck-island.html" class="external">Sir Peter Viggers</a></strong>, who claimed Â£1645 for a floating duck island. This seems to me to be a legitimate and imaginative use of taxpayers' money, quite unlike such abuses as moat-cleaning, mortgage interest, and food—except food for ducks, which is fine.</p>
