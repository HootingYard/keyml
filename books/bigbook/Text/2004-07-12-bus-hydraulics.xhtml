  <h1>Bus Hydraulics</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Glyn Webster writes&nbsp;: “The bus driver on my <a class="external" href="http://www.ew.govt.nz/regionalservices/passengertransport/timetables/hamiltoncity/hillcrest10.htm">route</a> has learnt to play music on the door-opening hydraulics of his bus. When a pretty woman signals for a stop, he likes to make the door go <em>A Phoo A Phoota Phoo A Phoo-phoo Phoot! HISS</em> as it opens. What is that tune?” Well, Glyn, if I'm not mistaken it could be either the <em>Passacaglia</em> or one of the <em>Four Sea Interludes</em> from Benjamin Britten's opera <em>Peter Grimes</em>. Any readers wishing to look further into this matter can go to the splendid <a class="external" href="http://www.grsites.com/sounds/vehicle006.shtml">Vehicle Sound Effects</a> page, where such alluring items as <em>bus pulling away</em>, <em>bus turn signal</em>, <em>bus applying airbrakes</em> and, indeed, <em>bus door opening and closing</em> can all be listened to.</p>
