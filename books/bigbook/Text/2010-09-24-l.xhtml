  <h1 id="post-5293">L</h1>
  <p>After that little interruption we return to our alphabetic schedule with L. And as with G, L is a double bill, for L stands for both Lettuce and Leeks.</p>
  <p>According to the <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-11380834" class="external">BBC</a></strong>, there was much amusement recently when police in Hampshire released an e-fit picture of a burglary suspect who appeared to be wearing a lettuce on his head.</p>

  </div>
  <p>What has gone unremarked is the possibility that the image may be devastatingly accurate, and that it is the habit of burglars and other ne'er-do-wells in the Hampshire area to sport the makings of salads upon their bonces. It would not surprise me if some urban folklorist, attached perhaps to a polytechnic, was at this very moment preparing a monograph on, say, the radish-wearing footpad of Gosport, or the Winchester Watercress Rascal.</p>
  <p>A wider range of vegetables has been used by miscreant scamps in the past, of course, though for hiding behind rather than wearing openly upon the head. Six long years ago <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/apr04.htm#2004-04-06-2" class="hootingyard">here</a></strong> at Hooting Yard we dealt, in passing, with the case of the chap who skulked under cover of a serried array of leeks hanging from a ceiling.</p>

    <p class="imagerow"><img class="size-full" src="../Images/2010-09-leeks.jpg" alt="leeks" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>It just goes to show that sooner or later the so-called “real world” tends to catch up with Hooting Yard, albeit sometimes at a slightly lopsided or tangential angle.</p>
