  <p class="noindent">“The reviewer gets carried away with his own sensational tale of ‘Medea Blenkinsop, or the Octogamist’:</p>
  <p>‘But think of the shifts and perplexities of a wife with eight husbands, being not only mysteriously married like Aurora Floyd to her noble husband's horse-trainer, but… also to the Emperor of China, who writes compromising letters by each mail, the more compromising as she is also secretly married to the postman, who is of a suspicious temper…; also, under peculiar circumstances, to the giant of a show that is coming to be set up at a fair in the neighbourhood; also to a maniac whom she keeps in the cellar.'”</p>
  <p>Cited in <em>The Maniac In The Cellar&nbsp;: Sensation Novels Of The 1860s</em> by Winifred Hughes (Princeton University Press, 1980)</p>
