  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“People with inconveniently long memories recalled a youth of like name who got into trouble at Whitechapel for selling Kosher fowls judiciously weighted with sand: and there was also a story about a young man who manipulated three thimbles and a pea on Epsom Downs.
