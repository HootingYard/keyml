  <h1 id="post-3911">Impenetrable Mysteries</h1>
  <p>There are certain impenetrable mysteries which tug at our imaginations and allow us no peace of mind. I am sure I am not the only person to be kept awake at night, tossing and turning, chewing the pillow, my brain fuming as I ponder in perplexity for the umpteenth time whether, for example, <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badge_man" class="external">Badge Man</a></strong> was a living, breathing, armed maniac or merely a trick of the light, whether the Loch Ness Monster truly exists or is just a figment in the minds of socially inept men in anoraks who like to spend their time sitting in the lochside drizzle with Thermos flask and binoculars, whether it is permissible simply to wipe over one's socks when performing <strong><a href="http://www.islam.tc/cgi-bin/askimam/cat.pl?c=Purity%20(Tahaarah)" class="external">wudhu</a></strong>. These are all terrifically mysterious matters, and there are many more, so many more it is a wonder we are not stunned into mental collapse.</p>
  <p>Every now and then, we stumble upon some fragmentary clue which promises to shed light where previously there has been only darkness, ignorance, and numbing stupidity. One of the greatest puzzles gnawing away inside my head has long been to find an answer to the question: <em>what did Tiny Enid do, once she had grown up and was no longer tiny?</em> Though I am still unable to give a full account of her adult doings, I can, today, say one thing with a modicum of confidenceâ€”she dressed up as a bat.</p>

  <p>There remains some doubt whether this really is Tiny Enid. It may be an impostor, or even a hallucination brought on by a surfeit of lampreys. I am clutching at straws, dammit, but sometimes that is all we can do.</p>
