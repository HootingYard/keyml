  <h1 id="post-8710">Our <em>Milieu</em> Is That Of Doctor Ludwig</h1>
  <p>Last night I dreamed that I was walking in Saint Chad's Park, past a music rehearsal studio, within which I could hear a beat combo practising. The song I overheard—which, in dreamland, I understood to be a Sleater-Kinney cover version—consisted of a single line, repeated over and over again: “Our <em>milieu</em> is that of Doctor Ludwig”. Very melodious.</p>
