  <h1>Dobson</h1>
  <p>How are we to get the measure of Dobson? We do not know his first name. We know neither the year of his birth, nor that of his death. (We do know that he is buried near his favourite lighthouse.) Virtually every last scrap of his work has been destroyed. All that remains is a short play, <em>The Glue In The Palace Was Rarefied; The Putty Was Dreadful.</em> This astonishing drama has only ever been performed once, on the London radio station <a class="external" href="http://www.resonancefm.com/">Resonance FM</a>, by Pansy Cradledew and <a class="external" href="http://www.evrah.org.uk/">Evrah</a>â€”and even then, it was misattributed to someone called Istvan Scrimgeour. Here, then, for your pleasure &amp; education, is Dobson's majestic work in all its <a class="internal" href="2003-12-22-the-glue-in-the-palace-was-rarefied-the-putty-was-dreadful.xhtml">glory</a>!</p>
