  <h1 id="post-7791">Hooting Yard Advent Calendar (vii)</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Today's advent calendar picture is an old trading card for celery compound. Personally, I always thought a celery compound was a fenced-off area where you grew celery, much as the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts is a sort of fenced-off area for the keeping of Kennedys. But apparently not. You live and learnâ€”especially with Hooting Yard as your guide!</p>
