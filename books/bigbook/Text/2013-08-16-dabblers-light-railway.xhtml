  <p>In my <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/08/the-dlr-forecast/" class="external">Dabbler</a></em></strong> cupboard this week I make a convincing argument that the names of the stations on the Docklands Light Railway are as worthy of having their own dedicated forecast on the radio as those oh so evocative shipping areas.</p>
  <p>And while we are on the subject of BBC Radio 4, I should note that I learned something very fascinating on <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/08/the-fathomless-mysteries-of-farming-today/" class="external">Farming Today</a></em></strong> this morning. Apparently, on no account whatsoever should you ever tell anybody how many sheep you have, even if they have the gall to come out and ask you directly. Remember that.</p>
