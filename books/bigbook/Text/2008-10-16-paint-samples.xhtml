  <h1 id="post-766">Paint Samples</h1>
  <p class="noindent">OutaSpaceman sends news of some exciting paint samples. A company called <strong><a href="http://www.green-scene.co.uk/products.html#texturepaints" class="external">Green-Scene</a></strong> offers tins of General Muck, Corporal Crap, Devon Soil, and—my favourite for obvious reasons—Yard Filth. There is something endearing about a website advertising paint samples on which most of the pictures are missing, promising “Image Coming Soon”, dated 2005.</p>
