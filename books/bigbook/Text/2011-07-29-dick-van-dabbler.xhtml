  <p>This week in <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/07/porpoises-rescue-dick-van-dyke/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I provide a unique insight into my working methods, casting a frank and unstinting* gaze upon the creative process involved in the writing of the masterpiece that is&nbsp;<em>Porpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention of which reminds me that, several days after publication, there may be one or two readers in far-flung corners of the earth who have not yet bought copies. You know who you are. Zip thyselves o'er to <strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/porpoises-rescue-dick-van-dyke/16323249#" class="external">Lulu</a></strong> and make purchase now, tardy ones!</p>
  <p>* <strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> “Unstinting”, in this context, means “not involving at any stage the participation of a stint”. As any fule kno, a stint is a type of bird, specifically a very small wader known in North America as a peep. They can be difficult to identify because of the similarity between species, and various breeding, non-breeding, juvenile and moulting plumages, but you shouldn't let that stop you.</p>
