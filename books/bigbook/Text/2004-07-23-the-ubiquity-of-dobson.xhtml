  <h1>The Ubiquity of Dobson</h1>
  <p>A Google search for <em>Dobson</em> yields no less than 1,150,000 results. Of course, a handful of these purport to be about other Dobsons, rather than the out-of-print pamphleteer himself. Having examined all the pages with a fine tooth comb, I am breathless in my admiration for Dobson's skills as a master of disguise. He has somehow managed to continue his subterfuge from beyond the grave, which is some feat, as I am sure you can appreciate. But it was ever thus. Four days after his death, a balaclava-clad farmyard person swore an affidavit before a provincial solicitor that he had seen Dobson squatting behind his pig hut, scribbling notes into a ledger, but that when he—the farmyard person—returned with cronies, to accost the wraith, “Dobson”, if it was he, had vanished, leaving only a toothpaste tube from which much of the paste had already been eked, and a sinister plasticine duck, possibly intended to be a bufflehead, the head of which was squashed by the farmyard person's mastiff, by accident. Was it Dobson? Probably not, but who can say for certain?</p>
  <p>Inspired by the <a class="external" href="http://www.reaganlegacy.org">Ronald Reagan Legacy Project</a>, whose aim is to “name at least one notable public landmark in each [US] state and all 3,067 counties after the 40th president [i.e., the Potus]”, Hooting Yard is setting up the Dobson Legacy Project. No city, town, village, hamlet, or cluster of shabby rural buildings ought to be without its very own <em>Dobson Boulevard</em>. I implore all readers to fire off a letter to their local bureaucrat this very minute!</p>
