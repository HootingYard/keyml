  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“He recalled to me, too, the case of a well-known novelist who has recently contracted to supply a publisher with four novels in one year, each novel to run to not less than a hundred thousand words. Even Balzac's titanic industry must hide its diminished head before such appalling fecundity; and what would Horace have to say to such froglike verbal spawning?” — Richard Le Gallienne, <em>Imperishable Fiction</em></p>
