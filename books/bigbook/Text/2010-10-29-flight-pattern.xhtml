  <p>I am not a frequent flier, so it may be some while before I can take advantage of this excellent service. However, next time I am summoned to an important Hooting Yard-related international conference, I shall insist that my all-expenses-paid trip is made via Henri Lehmann Airlines. Satisfied customer Saint Catherine of Alexandria chirrups: “My flight was so comfortable it was almost as if angels were transporting me to my dedicated monastery at Mount Sinai after a foolhardy attempt by bad, bad heathens to have me broken on the wheel”.</p>
