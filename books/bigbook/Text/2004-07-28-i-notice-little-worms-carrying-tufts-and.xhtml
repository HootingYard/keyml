  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“I notice little worms carrying tufts and feathers; I make out some with flabby fins constantly flapping on their backs. What are they all doing there? What are their names? I do not know. And I stare at them for ever so long, held by the incomprehensible mystery of the waters.” — J Henri Fabre, <em>The Life Of The Fly</em></p>
