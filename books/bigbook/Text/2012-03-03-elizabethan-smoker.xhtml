  <p>The estimable <strong><a href="http://www.wartimehousewife.com/2012/03/smoking-is-not-illegal-2-the-hypocrisy-gathers-pace/" class="external">Wartime Housewife</a></strong> has a rant about the latest stupidity regarding tobacco sales, so I don't have to. Instead, in a no doubt doomed attempt to redress the balance, here is a splendid image of a smoker unburdened by modern restrictions. John White's “The Flyer” (1587) shows an Algonquian shaman prancing around, with his tobacco in a pouch slung around his waist and, most importantly, a small black bird tied to his head. I think perhaps this is the correct attitude to adopt.</p>
