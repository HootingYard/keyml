  <h1>A Dream Of Ginger</h1>
  <p>Several years ago, I wrote “Accounts of dreams are rarely of interest to anyone other than the dreamer” before going on to <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/aug05.htm#2005-08-11-1" class="hootingyard">describe</a></strong> a dream in which I was about to attack the late actor Roy Kinnear with a chair-leg. Since then, I have occasionally <strong><a href="2011-11-12-dreaming-a-dream.xhtml" class="internal" title="Dreaming A Dream">shared</a></strong> with readers other <strong><a href="2011-09-02-the-vanbrugh-chicken.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Vanbrugh Chicken">dreams</a></strong> I have <strong><a href="2011-08-12-dream-tribunal.xhtml" class="internal" title="Dream Tribunal">had</a></strong>, when I think they may be of interest. What I have not done is to recount somebody else's slumberland visions. I was so delighted, however, by reader Mark Patterson's dream that I felt impelled to post it here:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dreamt last night that my only Christmas present was a ‘Ginger Complains' dvd. 70 minutes of poor quality footage featuring Ginger Baker grumbling about this and that in front of a succession of run-down cinemas. ‎25% of his griping was inaudible due to poor sound quality.</p>
