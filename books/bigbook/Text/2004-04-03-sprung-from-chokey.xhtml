  <h1>Sprung From Chokey</h1>
  <p class="noindent">News has reached us that Mrs Gubbins has been sprung from chokey. (See 23rd March for details of her arrest.) She is now holed up in a safe house—or, more properly, derelict shed—protected by a heavily-armed gang of thugs wearing boa constrictor masks. They are subsisting on a diet of gruel, slops and pap until a criminal supply line can be set in place. We will keep you fully informed of developments. Please remember them in your prayers.</p>
