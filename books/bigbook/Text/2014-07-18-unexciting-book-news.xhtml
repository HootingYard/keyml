  <h1>Unexciting Book News</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Back in February I <strong><a href="2014-02-11-exciting-book-news.xhtml" class="internal" title="Exciting Book News">announced</a></strong> the forthcoming book <em>Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</em>. You lot have no doubt been panting with spittle-flecked anticipation ever since, impatiently awaiting the day when you can sashay into your nearest bookshop and buy dozens of copies for family, friends, and semiliterate hobbledehoys you encounter in the queue at the soup kitchen.</p>
  <p>Alas! What with one thing and another, unbeknown to me, Constable have decided to postpone publication until September 2015. To ensure that your Christmas is not thereby ruined, I will try my best to issue a brand new <strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/frankkey" class="external">Lulu</a></strong> paperback for the festive season. Watch this space.</p>
