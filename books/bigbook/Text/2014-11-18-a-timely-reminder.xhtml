  <h1 id="post-13482">A Timely Reminder</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It has come to my attention that some among you lot are not spending your appointed three hours per day listening to <em>Jubilate Agno</em>, Christopher Smart's lengthy and demented poem, recited in full by Mr Key and Germander Speedwell. Happily, there is a link to the recording at the <strong><em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2011/01/31/christopher-smarts-jubilate-agno/" class="external">Public Domain Review</a></em></strong>. Backsliders take note!</p>
  <p>Which prompts me to bring to your attention the newly-published <em>Public Domain Review&nbsp;: Selected Essays 2011â€“2013</em>, a book which you ought to buy immediately. Go <strong><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/essay-book/" class="external">here</a></strong> for further details and ordering information. Mr Key's piece on Kit Smart is included in the book, so it is a necessary purchase (along with <strong><a href="2014-11-18-a-timely-reminder.xhtml" class="internal" title="Kew. Rhone."><em>Kew. Rhone.</em></a></strong>) for all fanatically devoted Hooting Yard completists, which of course is every last one of you.</p>
