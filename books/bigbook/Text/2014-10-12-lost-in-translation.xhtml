  <h1 id="post-13329">Lost In Translation</h1>
  <p>Sometimes I find myself fretting about things which common sense tells me are absolutely not worth fretting about. Yet still I fret. Think of it as idiotic fretting.</p>
  <p>The latest matter to consume my stupid attention is as follows. I was struck, when watching Danish television dramas such as <em>Borgen</em> and <em>The Killing</em>, by the immense politeness of the Danes. In both shows, the characters are forever saying “Takk” (“Thank you”), certainly more so than the average Brit or American would do. I am not familiar with real life in Denmark, but I assume that the writers of these series are making every effort to reproduce the actual speech of contemporary Danes.</p>
  <p>In <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, by contrast, we are told by Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) that “there is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki”. Given that the Dothraki are a savage and barbaric race whose idea of a square meal is to consume a whole horse-heart, raw, the absence of an expression of gratitude is not surprising.</p>
  <p>But what is bothering me is this&nbsp;: when Danish dramas are shown on Dothraki television, how in heaven's name will the subtitle-writers cope with all those “Takk”s?</p>
  <p>It is, to be sure, a proper quandary, if an idiotic one.</p>
