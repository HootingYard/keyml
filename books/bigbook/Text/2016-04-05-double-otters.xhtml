  <h1 id="post-14680">Double Otters</h1>
  <p>If you are in the vicinity of a riverbank, and you see two otters, this is known as Double Otters. Mark your little dun cardboard slip accordingly, in pencil, and take it to the kiosk. The man at the kiosk—argumentative, boisterous, catarrh-riddled, dismal, eggy (as in the Beatles' song), flip, gaunt, horrible, ill, jaded, knock-knee'd, lascivious, mordant—will exchange your slip for a prize, usually a biro or a balloon.</p>
  <p>He is a fallen man. When you are not looking, he will blub into a napkin.</p>
