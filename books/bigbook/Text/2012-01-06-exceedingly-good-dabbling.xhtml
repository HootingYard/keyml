  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2012/01/poetry-cake-exceedingly-plain-biscuits/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week, I consider that hallowed realm where poetry and cake collide. And that's not all, for my ruminations lead me from poetry and cake to poetry and biscuits, all in just four brief paragraphs. Even the loveable Liverpudlian moptops get a mention. It's all so exciting it's enough to make an ant keel over and die.</p>
