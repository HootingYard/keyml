  <h1>Emblem</h1>
  <p>Alert readers will have noted the appearance (thrice) of a crest or emblem at the top of the page. This is taken from the pamphlet <em>Dobson's Heraldic Dossier</em>, a bewildering little booklet which the great pamphleteer had specially printed on an antique press which Marigold Chew discovered rotting away in a blizzard-swept tent on the outskirts of Helsinki during her tour of Finland. Dobson writes in hallucinatory prose about what he calls “the new heraldry” which he planned to usher in, and provides a number of examples of his own devising, though it is thought that the artwork itself was completed by Chew.
