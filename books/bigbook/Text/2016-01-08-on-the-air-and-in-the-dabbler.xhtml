  <h1 id="post-14421">On the Air And In The Dabbler</h1>
  <p>This is a brief reminder that each week's episode of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> is now posted on <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-7th-january-2016/" class="external">Mixcloud</a></strong> almost as soon as it has been broadcast. Delve through the archives and you can listen to Mr Key babbling into your eardrums until the cows come home. Yesterday's show includes a sort of homage to David Bowie on his 69th birthday, and the text appears in today's <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2016/01/bewlay-the-landgrave/" class="external">Dabbler</a></strong>, so if you wish you can read and listen at the same time.</p>
