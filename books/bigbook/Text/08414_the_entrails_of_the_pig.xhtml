  <h1 id="post-8414">The Entrails Of The Pig</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Today is Collop Monday, so here is what you ought to be eating (and a tip on what to do with the servants):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">PIG-FRY—This is a Collop Monday dish, and is a necessary appendage to <em>“cracklings”</em>. It consists of the fattest parts of the entrails of the pig, broiled in an oven. Numerous herbs, spices, &amp;c. are added to it ; and upon the whole, it is a more sightly <em>“course”</em> at table than fat cracklings. Sometimes the good wife indulges her house with a pancake, as an assurance that she has not forgotten to provide for Shrove Tuesday. The servants are also treated with “a drop of something good” on this occasion; and are allowed (if they have nothing of importance to require their immediate attention) to spend the afternoon in conviviality.</p>
  </blockquote>
