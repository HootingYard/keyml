  <h1 id="post-719">A Rustic Lesson</h1>
  <p>Oh the farmer's dancing round a pit. He's trapped Beelzebub in it. Upon a branch a warbling tit sings: We have chained the devil-oh.</p>
  <p>The farmer tramples in the muck. His belly's full of boiled duck. A chicken makes a warning cluck, says: The devil's loosed his chains-oh.</p>
  <p>The sky above is a sudden black. The devil leaps up on the farmer's back. He puts the farmer in a sack and he jumps back into the pit-oh.</p>
  <p>The chicken clucks and the tit still sings. It beats its frozen little wings. Oh rustics, you must learn these things: Don't try to chain the devil-oh.</p>
  <p>Till your fields and hoe your ground. Harrow the earth and don't look round when you hear that awful sound: The devil's boiling the farmer-oh.</p>
  <p>That duck he ate avenged its fate. It took Baal's shape and had Baal's hate. The farmer learned that much too late, and he'll dance no more round the pit-oh.</p>
