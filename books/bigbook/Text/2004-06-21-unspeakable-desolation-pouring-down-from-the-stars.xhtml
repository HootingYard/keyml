  <h1>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From the Stars</h1>
  <p>About ten years ago I wrote a short, unpublished novel entitled <em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em>. (I stole that phrase, incidentally, from <em>Playing With Water</em> by James Hamilton-Paterson, which I recommend.) The time has come, I think, to place the complete text of this exciting philatelic adventure story on to the Hooting Yard site, but rather than doing so in one go, it will appear as a weekly serial. Every Monday, for the next thirteen weeks, a chapter will be added. To begin reading, click on the postage stamp. But don't forget to come back.</p>
