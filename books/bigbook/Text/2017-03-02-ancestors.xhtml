  <p class="noindent">Oh look, a tubercular peasant, slouching through the muck. His tunic is a filthy rag. He lacks both grit and pluck.<br />
  If he had either, he'd stand tall, and shake his fist at God, and he would stride on o'er the hills, chuckling like Ken Dodd.<br />
  But he has never laughed, not once, in all his peasant years. And there is nothing, just a void, in between his ears.<br />
  Your ancestors were all like this, or most of them, at least. A slouching, snivelling ignoramus … “And what rough beast…?”</p>
