  <h1 id="post-1526">Potato Blot</h1>
  <p class="noindent"><a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2009/01/potato-fair.html" class="external"><strong>Mustard Plaster</strong></a> provides a link to the pamphlet <em>The $100 Prize Essay On The Cultivation Of The Potato, Prize offered by W.T. Wylie and awarded to D.A. Compton</em> to which is appended <em>How To Cook The Potato, Furnished by Prof. Blot</em> (New York, 1870). Well worth a read if you are a potatoey person, which I sincerely hope you are.</p>
  <p>Prof. Blot, by the way, is <a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/authors/author_blot.html" class="external"><strong>Pierre Blot</strong></a> (c.1818–1874), a man whose name I would have had to invent had he not already existed. According to culinary historian Jan Longone, “As far as I can tell, no other nineteenth-century cook in America was treated with a comparable level of media hyperbole”. Alas, after his death, an article written about him concluded that “he lived to see himself neglected and discarded by a capricious public”.</p>
  <p>The Pierre Blot revival begins here!</p>
