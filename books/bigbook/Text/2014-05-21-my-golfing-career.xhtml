  <h1 id="post-12746">My Golfing Career</h1>
  <p>In correspondence with one of my correspondents the other day, the subject of golf was raised. (There was a Herman Melville connection, with which I will not tax you.) This led me to recall a childhood memory, and I fired off an email as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The only time in my life I ever played a round of golf was when I was eight years old. I was with a friend and his Scottish grandfather. My abiding memory of the adventure is that the grandfather whacked me on the elbow—hard—with his golf club. He insisted it was an accident. Hmm.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To which my correspondent replied:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for that piece of information—I am wondering whether the disclosure of the grandfather's nationality is a mere embellishment, or actually a key detail of the tale.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Without giving the matter much, or indeed any, thought, I replied immediately to say that I thought the detail highly significant. I have never played golf again.</p>
