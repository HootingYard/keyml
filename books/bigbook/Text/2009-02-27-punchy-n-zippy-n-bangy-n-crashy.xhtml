  <h1 id="post-1935">Punchy &amp; Zippy &amp; Bangy &amp; Crashy</h1>
  <p>Last week, Mrs Gubbins suffered some sort of mental collapse and called in a team of consultants to overhaul the Hooting Yard “brand image”. The octogenarian crone put aside her knitting and got it into her head that what was needed was a brand new logo. “It has to be punchy and zippy and bangy and crashy,” she drivelled, adding that she wanted something that a half-blind orphan child could reproduce with a crumbling crayon. I have no idea how much the consultants charged for their work, but knowing these charlatans it was probably thousands and thousands of pounds. When the invoice turns up I shall cast it into a waste disposal chute. Anyway, here is the new logo, based I am told on an <strong><a href="http://beineckeearlymodern.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/book-of-secrets-alchemy-and-the-european-imagination-1500-2000-2/" class="external">illustration</a></strong> from an alchemical treatise of long, long ago.</p>
