  <h1>Victorian Aether Ships, Etc</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Mr Key has recruited a hare-brained academic with wild hair and smudged spectacles to carry out an analysis of search terms which fetch people up at Hooting Yard. You will recall that some poor soul came here having sought information on <strong><a href="2009-09-17-character-flaw-of-mediaeval-peasant.xhtml" class="internal" title="Character Flaw Of Mediaeval Peasant">“character flaw of mediaeval peasant”</a></strong>. Among recent phrases of interest are:</p>
  <p>Iron wolf implements</p>
  <p>Victorian aether ships</p>
  <p>John Le Mesurier dentures</p>
  <p>Mormon goat</p>
  <p>How to make a crow</p>
  <p>How to cook a cormorant</p>
  <p>I am hoping my befuddled academic discovers that the person seeking culinary tips for cormorants was Peter Maxwell Davies, the Master of the Queen's Music famed for his swan-eating activities. We shall wait and see.</p>
