  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The figure was that of a man, in shabby clothes, with a sallow, mean face, a retreating forehead, with hair cut after the French fashion, and a moustache, dark. The jaws and chin were covered with a bristly growth, as if shaving had been neglected for a fortnight. The figure did not appear to be thoroughly solid, but to be of the consistency of curd, and the face was of the complexion of curd.” — Sabine Baring-Gould, <em>A Dead Finger</em></p>
