  <p class="noindent">Here, to brighten your day, is a picture of an imperilled noodlehead. The source of his peril was lurking in one of the custard-balls piled in his bowl. Due to monstrous kitchen slapdashery, a gewgaw was inadvertently baked into one of the balls. The gewgaw, a tiny metal cameo brooch depicting Gordon Sumner, is now stuck in the noodlehead's throat, and he is choking. Let us hope that he manages to spit it out.</p>
  <p class="noindent">Gordon Sumner is one of that select band of middle-aged popular singers who still calls himself by a nickname he adopted as a considerably younger man. In his case, that name is <em>Sting</em>, or possibly <em>Stig</em>. Doesn't this embarrass him? Does he occasionally wake screaming in the night and phone Paul Hewson, or <em>Bono</em> as he is absurdly known, so that they can compare notes on their irretrievable loss of dignity?</p>
