  <h1 id="post-15448">The New Look</h1>
  <p>For a number of reasons, it has proved necessary to faff about with the technical gubbins lurking behind the Hooting Yard website, hence this new look. My—and your—thanks are due to the boffin who worked tirelessly to ensure the whole thing is still here on the internet. He has now gone away to a foreign land for a well-deserved break.</p>
  <p>Inevitably, there will be a few teething problems. I noted, for example, that the index to the Archives, making them accessible by date and topic under the tab above, has vanished. I know that most of you lot spend virtually all your waking hours reading, rereading, and rerereading the ten years' worth of potsages [sic] gathered here, so until we fix that, upon the boffin's return, I suggest you make use of the Search box to rummage around.</p>
  <p>Please let me know of any other blips, bloops, or catastrophic horrors you may spot, and we shall endeavour to put things straight.</p>
