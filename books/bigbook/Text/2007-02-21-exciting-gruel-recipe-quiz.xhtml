  <h1 id="post-69">Exciting Gruel Recipe Quiz</h1>
  <p>The following recipe is an effective remedy for a common malady. All you have to do is to use your skill, judgment, and pulsating brain flashes to work out the malady.</p>
  <p><em>1 Pint New Gruel, 1 gr. Tincture of Green Acorns, 1/2 gr. Hypo, 1/16 gr. Castor Sugar, 3 Clove Kernels, 1/2 lb. Coffee Essence, 3/4 lb. Sugar of Zinc, 2 gr. Bisulphate of Lead, 1 Pint Spirits of Sulphur, 5 gr. Bicarbonate of Saltpetre, 1 oz. Table Salt.</em></p>
  <p>Tip: I recommend making up a big pot of the lovely gruelly goo and using it to treat a variety of wretched and woe-inducing medical conditions. If you lack the patience to do so, and are instead making wild and witless guesses, you will find the correct answer at <a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2007/02/happy-pancake-eating.html" class="external">Mustard Plaster</a>.</p>
