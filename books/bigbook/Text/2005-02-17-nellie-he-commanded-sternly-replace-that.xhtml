  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“ ‘Nellie,’ he commanded sternly, 'replace that receptacle where you found it. As you surmise, it contains a substance of incalculable value—the first practical preparation of Zapt's Repulsive Paste.'… Sargent crossed to gaze into the little bucket his fiancée was holding. ‘Does look sort of repulsive,’ he agreed after a glance at the mess in the bottom of the pail. 'But—you mean this stuff is responsible for Fluffy's sudden elevation in life?' ” — J U Giesy, <em>Zapt's Repulsive Paste</em></p>
