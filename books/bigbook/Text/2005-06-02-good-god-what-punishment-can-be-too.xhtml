  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Good God! what punishment can be too great, what mark of infamy sufficiently signal, for those pernicious villains of talent, who have employed that talent in the composition of Bacchanalian songs; that is to say, pieces of fine and captivating writing in praise of one of the most odious and destructive vices in the black catalogue of human depravity!” — William Cobbett, <em>Advice To Young Men And (Incidentally) To Young Women In The Middle And Higher Ranks Of Life</em></p>
