  <h1 id="post-14687">Park Bench</h1>
  <p>This confounded Hooting Yard hiatus has gone on long enough. My apologies for the silence. I am hoping to give my brain a good kicking to get it back on track.</p>
  <p>Regular readers will know that the municipal park bench is a recurring motif in my prose. Imagine my unalloyed glee, then, to discover the existence of an actor and director named <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0070339/?ref_=nv_sr_1" class="external">Park Bench</a></strong>. One of his films is called The Secret of Goat. These things make me extremely happy.</p>
