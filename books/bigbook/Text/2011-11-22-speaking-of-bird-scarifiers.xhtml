  <h1>Speaking Of Bird Scarifiers…</h1>
  <p class="noindent">… as I was just now, in <strong><a href="2011-11-22-the-wooden-lake.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Wooden Lake">The Wooden Lake</a></strong>, reminds me to bring to your attention a weekend postage at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/11/musical-behemoths/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, where Mahlerman tells us about Havergal Brian's <em>Gothic Symphony</em>, which</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">calls for up to one thousand performers, including nine choirs, four offstage brass bands, and the normal orchestra size doubled-up to about 150 players. A vast percussion section includes chains, a thunder machine and a bird scare.</p>
    <p>That Brian was one of the great British eccentrics has never been in doubt</p>
