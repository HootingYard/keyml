  <h1 id="post-7851">Wheatley As Roussel</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Here is a snippet from Phil Baker's excellent <em>The Devil Is A Gentleman&nbsp;: The Life And Times Of Dennis Wheatley</em> (2009):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><em>Star Of Ill Omen</em> is an extraordinary performance, with its characteristically fraught and tender Wheatley love story (quite unlike James Bond and his girls) embedded in a mind-bogglingly improbable Cold War potboiler. Realistic details are combined with a larger naivety about space that wouldn't be out of place in Dan Dare, and there are moments whose sheer weirdness compares with the work of proto-surrealist Raymond Roussel: when, for example, the insects [a breed of hyper-intelligent insects who buzz around like bees and give telepathic orders] show them black and white films of great moments in human history, and</p>
    <p>“the bee-beetles who controlled the machine again pressed the lever; again the machine whirred and the words came, ‘Music while you work’, followed by the rumba.”</p>
    <p>Wheatley never attempted science fiction again.</p>
