  <h1 id="post-13828">Key Twit</h1>
  <p class="noindent">As most of you lot know, I do not engage with Twitter. (The <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hootingyard" class="external">Hooting Yard Twitfeed</a></strong> is an automated bit of gubbins that updates whenever I post something here.). It has been brought to my attention, however, that last week I was all over Twitter like a rashâ€”if being retwitted over fifty times is, as I am assured, a rash. The cause of the hoo-hah was the attention given to a letter I had published in <em>The Spectator</em> which is, I hope, self-explanatory.</p>
