  <p class="noindent">My more astute readers will be aware that I have, for many years, immersed myself in the world of gangsta rap. Indeed, only the other day Ice-T popped round for a cup of (non-iced) tea and we had a long and frank discussion about all sorts of gangsta rappy topics. I am of course completely <em>au fait</em> with the argot, so much so that even Ice himself had difficulty understanding me.</p>
  <p>I mention this as a preamble to my news that I have been commissioned by an academic press to edit a book of essays exploring the crucial influence, in the development of gangsta rap, of fotherington-tomas. I think we all know that the St Custard's pupil who is uterly wet and a sissy is the presiding spirit of gangsta rap, the role model whose example Ice-T and all the other rappers, whose names escape me for the moment, strive to emulate.</p>
  <p>Submissions for the book are welcome, and please bear in mind that you will be forgiven if your essay contains any uncouth words.</p>
