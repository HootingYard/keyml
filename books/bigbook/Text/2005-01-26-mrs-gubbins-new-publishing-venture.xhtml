  <h1>Mrs Gubbins' New Publishing Venture</h1>
  <p class="noindent">That indefatigable crone Mrs Gubbins has announced the launch of a brand new, subscription-only magazine. Here she is, to tell us all about it:</p>
  <p>Hello readers. It was a dark and stormy night, just like in that novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and I was lying awake in bed, tossing and turning under my counterpane, watching little fairies twinkling over by my washstand, when I had one of my bright ideas. Actually the fairies may have been moths. Anyway, all of a sudden I realised that there would be a huge market for a glossy magazine, with a spine, probably, devoted to velcro, dubbin and crayons. I jumped out of bed, a bit creakily, and went over to my escritoire, rummaged for my lorgnette, found a pad and pencil, and scribbled down my ideas in the dark, because my little lamp is broken and I was too excited to go all the way across the room to turn on the main light.</p>
  <p>I decided to call my magazine <em>A Daily Digest About Velcro, Dubbin And Crayons By Bathsheba Gubbins (Mrs)</em>. That has a nice ring to it, don't you think? In the first issue I thought I would tell my thousands of subscribers the story of how George de Mestral invented velcro in 1948 after taking his dog for a walk. “I will design a unique, two-sided fastener,” he decided, “one side with stiff hooks like burrs and the other side with soft loops like the fabric of my pants. I will call my invention <a class="external" href="http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa091297.htm">velcro</a>—a combination of the words <em>velour</em> and <em>crochet</em>. It will rival the zipper in its ability to fasten.” That would take up a few pages.</p>
  <p>Then I would have a picture spread about <a class="external" href="http://www.simplyoz.com/products/footwear/rossi_boots/accessories/dubbin">dubbin</a>, a combination of oils, beeswax and other waxes, hence the pleasant smell when opening the can. I would have to make a few telephone calls come morning to see if I could include a little scratch-and-sniff panel on page 14.</p>
  <p>The remainder of issue one would be an exciting article all about <a class="external" href="http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/story060.htm">crayons</a>, including the fact that Alice Binney came up with the brand name Crayola by combining two words that mean “oily chalk”. <em>Craie</em>, in French, means chalk, and <em>oleaginous</em> means oily.</p>
  <p>By the time I had planned out the first issue the storminess had ceased and the night was still, but before going back to bed to have a good long snooze, I made a quick note about what should go on the cover. I decided that each issue should have a full-colour cover-picture of a celebrity, if possible shown holding or using or maybe just ruminating upon velcro, dubbin, or crayons. Who could it be for the launch issue? It would have to be a toss-up between new US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Glenn Cornick, one-time bass guitarist of Jethro Tull.</p>
  <p>I scrambled back to bed happy in the knowledge that subscriptions would come pouring in.</p>
