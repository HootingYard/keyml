  <p><em>For day five of our tenth anniversary celebrations, here is a repost of an item that first appeared on 21 February 2007. You would do well to memorise it, and to chuck it into a lull during the conversation at one of those swish sophisticated cocktail parties you are forever going to (and I am not).</em></p>

  </blockquote>
