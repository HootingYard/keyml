  <h1 id="post-2668">Zippy</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I seem to have made a great clunking mistake. In the piece <a href="02665_groovy.xhtml" class="internal" title="Groovy"><strong>below</strong></a>, for “groovy” and its variations please read “zippy”, and its variations. There is a material difference, and one not to be sniffed at. Sniffing will not be countenanced. It's simply not a zippy thing to do.</p>
