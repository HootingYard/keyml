  <h1 id="post-438">Lost Pig</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I know next to nothing about computer games, but tireless Hooting Yard researcher Tristan J Shuddery tries hard to keep me abreast of the latest developments. Many thanks to Tristan, then, for alerting me to an exciting “interactive text adventure computer game” called Lost Pig. What topic could possibly be more thrilling? I admit myself to be befuddled by it, but for those of you who know how these things work, here is a <a href="http://jayisgames.com/ifiction/game/lostpig" class="external"><strong>link to it</strong></a>. Happy pig finding!</p>
