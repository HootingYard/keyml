  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“He wanted to know from actual knowledge what sort of places the saloons were. What he saw after a dozen visits to as many different groggeries added fuel to the flame of indignation that burned already hot in him. The sight of the vast army of men turning into beasts in these dens created in him a loathing and a hatred of the whole iniquitous institution that language failed to express.” — Charles M Sheldon, <em>The Crucifixion Of Philip Strong</em></p>
