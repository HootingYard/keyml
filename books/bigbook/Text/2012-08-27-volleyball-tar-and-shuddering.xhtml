  <h1>Volleyball, Tar &amp; Shuddering</h1>
  <p class="noindent">A couple of snaps of <em>Volleyball, Tar &amp; Shuddering</em>, a 1989 work by Mr Key. It consists of a set of fifteen cards each bearing a colour illustration and a scribbled text (plus two endpapers, or, I suppose, endcards). I cannot recall how many copies were issued, but its rarity value is such that it can fetch as much as 35p at today's prices.</p>
