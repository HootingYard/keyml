  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“No one should put any trust in the spoons, which are constructed apparently of pewter shavings in a chronic state of semi-fusion. On the evening of the second day, the landlady allowed a second knife at tea, as the knife-of-all-work had begun to knock up under the heavy strain upon its powers; but this supplementary instrument was of the ornamental kind, and, like other ornamental things, broke down at a crisis, which took the form of a piece of crust.” — George Forrest Browne, <em>Ice-Caves Of France And Switzerland</em></p>
