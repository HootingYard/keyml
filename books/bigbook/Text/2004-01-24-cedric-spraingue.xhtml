  <h1>Cedric Spraingue</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Cedric Spraingue, Inspector of Lighthouses (see below, 23rd January), ought not be confused with his relative Cedric William Spraingue. Quite why this confusion recurs is quite beyond reason and is a source of misery and teeth-gnashing to their descendants, the Spraingue kin of Blister Lane, who are the only people I know apart from the Kennedy clan to live in a “compound”. In a last ditch attempt to clear up the matter, short of knocking a few heads together, here is a narrative regarding Cedric William. A cursory reading should make quite plain that he was not the same man whose lighthouse inspections have become the stuff of legend. The text is entitled <a class="internal" href="2004-01-24-the-phial-of-broth.xhtml">The Phial of Broth</a>.</p>
