  <p>I know I shouldn't allow such twaddle to exasperate me so much. I know it is a sign of weakness, even of imminent mental collapse, when one feels compelled to post a comment at the <em>Guardian</em>. But alas, I couldn't help myself. To discover the cause of my intemperance, go and read <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/feb/22/university-challenge-trimble" class="external">this</a></strong>.
