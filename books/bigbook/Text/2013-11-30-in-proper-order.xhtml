  <h1 id="post-12132">In Proper Order</h1>
  <p>Reviewing <em>The Elements Of Eloquence</em> by Mark Forsythe in <em>The Spectator</em>, Christopher Howse notes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The shiniest piece of information I picked up is that, in English, adjectives go in this order:</p>
    <p>Opinion—size—age—shape—colour—origin—material—purpose—noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you'll sound like a maniac.</p>
    <p>This knowledge is implicitly mastered by all native speakers; to see it made explicit is an enjoyable revelation, like learning to carry a tray on the flat of your hand.</p>
