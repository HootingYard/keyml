  <h1 id="post-7573">Dreaming A Dream</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Last night I dreamed, not that I went to Manderlay again, yet again, yet again, but that I was hanging out with Emerson, Lake, and Lake's mother, but not Palmer, of whom there was no sign. It was uneventful, as dreams go, but when I woke I did wonder what it might mean, and I decided to ask that question on <del>Facebook</del> Facecloth.</p>
  <p>Answer came from <strong><a href="http://www.williamenglish.com/" class="external">William English</a></strong>, who wrote&nbsp;:&nbsp;“After careful consideration it seems obvious that by omitting Carl Palmer, drummer with Atomic Rooster, and substituting him with Lake's mother, you are erasing traumatic childhood memories of a “pram cellar” (being an anagram of Carl Palmer). Am I right?”</p>
  <p>Eek! It has all come flooding back. I shall now undergo rigorous recovered memory therapy.</p>

  <p class="center">Emerson (present), Lake (present), Palmer (absent), Lake's mother (not shown)</p>
  <p><strong>ADDENDUM&nbsp;:</strong> A particularly bewildering point about this dream is that I was never an aficionado of the band John Peel invariably referred to as Emerson, Lake &amp; Parker, and have never owned any of their music in LP or CD form, nor indeed in cassette or 8-track or mp3, nor in any other format yet dreamed up by sound reproduction boffins.</p>
