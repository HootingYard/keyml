  <h1>Larder Tips</h1>
  <p>Welcome to this month's Hooting Yard Larder Tips. If you have a larder, we strongly recommend that you stack the shelves with lots of jars containing different types of sauce. It is a good idea to glue a label to each jar, bearing the name of the sauce it contains. A bold, clear typeface should be used for the label, not some hasty scrawl made with the last remnant of a crayon. In the unlikely event that you do not drool with glee at the prospect of eating all those sauces, you can instead pack your larder with pots of paste, but follow the same labelling advice. Pots may need smaller labels than jars, so bear that in mind.</p>
  <p>Make sure your larder is airy. If the door shuts very very tight, and by some chance all the air is sucked out of the larder, you will find that you are unable to gain access to your jars of sauce, or pots of paste, because the larder will have become a vacuum, which nature abhors. Readers in the United States who face this quandary may find it useful to contact Dave Aspnes (pictured below) who is the current president of the <a class="external" href="http://www.avs.org/">American Vacuum Society</a>. As Dave says, “the historic roots of [the Society] are in the creation and measurement of vacuum”, so he should be able to help if your larder becomes one.</p>
