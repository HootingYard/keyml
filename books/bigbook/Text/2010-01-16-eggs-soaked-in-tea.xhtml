  <h1 id="post-3683">Eggs Soaked In Tea</h1>
  <p>Nowadays, if I understand these things correctly, long distance runners rehydrate themselves by glugging lots of water during a race. Such namby-pamby methods were alien to the doughty amateurs who ran the twenty-six mile Marathon at the 1908 Olympic Games in London. Among their refreshments along the route were muscatel grapes, calves' foot jelly with lemon, new-laid eggs soaked in tea, orange segments, brandy, champagne, and small doses of strychnine.</p>
  <p>So I learned from <em>The First</em> <em>London</em> <em>Olympics 1908</em> by Rebecca Jenkins (2008)</p>
