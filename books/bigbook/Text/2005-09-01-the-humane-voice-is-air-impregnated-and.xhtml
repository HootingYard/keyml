  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The Humane <em>Voice</em> is Air, impregnated, and made Sonorous by the impressed Character of the Life, or is such, as whilst it is in breathing forth, doth smite upon the Organs of the <em>Voice</em>, so, as <em>they tremble thereupon</em>; for indeed, without this tremulous Motion, no <em>Voice</em> is made: Yea, not only the <em>Larynx</em>, or Wind-pipe, doth thereupon tremble, but the whole Skull also; yea, and sometimes <em>all the Bones of the whole Body</em>, which any one may easily find in himself, by his applying his Hand to his Throat, and laying it on the top of his Head.” — John Conrade Amman, <em>The Talking Deaf Man</em></p>
