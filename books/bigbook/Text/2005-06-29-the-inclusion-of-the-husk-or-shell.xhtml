  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The inclusion of the husk or shell in some of the cheaper forms of chocolate is another reprehensible practice (strongly condemned), as they do not possess the qualities for which the kernel or nib is so highly prized. To prevent this practice it was enacted in 1770 that the shells or husks should be seized or destroyed, and the officer seizing them rewarded up to 20s. per hundredweight. From these a light, but not unpalatable, table decoction is still prepared in Ireland and elsewhere, under the designation of ‘miserables'.” — Brandon Head, <em>The Food Of The Gods&nbsp;: A Popular Account Of Cocoa</em></p>
