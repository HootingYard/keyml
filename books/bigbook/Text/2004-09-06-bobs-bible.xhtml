  <h1>Bob's Bible</h1>
  <p><a class="external" href="http://www.bdrak.com">Bob Drake</a> writes with exciting news:</p>
  <p>I opened the Bible (it fell open somewhere in <em>Daniel</em>) and the next nearest book (<em>The Hounds of Tindalos</em> by Frank Belknap Long) which opened somewhere in <em>The Space Eaters</em>. Folded a couple pages together and read:</p>
  <p>“I screamed and slashed hard as iron; as iron that shatters, and the horse didn't need anything. It will crush and break before I could throw the liver”.</p>
