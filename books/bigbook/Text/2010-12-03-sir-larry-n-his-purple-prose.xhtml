  <p class="noindent">“Olivier doesn't fall asleep, for him ‘the god Morpheus had applied his gentle pressure to my dormic nerve’; he doesn't go for a quick shag, Olivier has ‘tender venturings into the blessed unction of sex’. It's a masquerade.”</p>
  <p>Roger Lewis, <em>The Real Life Of Laurence Olivier</em> (1996), quoting from the actor's autobiography.</p>
