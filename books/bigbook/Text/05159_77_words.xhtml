  <p class="noindent">The history of Britain, 1939–2010, in seventy-seven words:</p>
  <p>“The British soul was at its zenith when everyone had clipped accents and sex was furtive and all men wore hats and leapt onto steam locomotives as they pulled out of the station (before&nbsp;alighting at Boxhill and Westhumble) and thin-moustached officers in&nbsp;tropical outposts sweated gin-and-tonic and quoted Latin proverbs; and everything that's happened since, from the welfare state to&nbsp;<em>The X Factor</em> to the Guardian website, has been unmistakeably symptomatic of our purposeless spiritual decline.”</p>
