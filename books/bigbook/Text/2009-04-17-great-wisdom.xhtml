  <h1 id="post-2306">Great Wisdom</h1>
  <p>The Islamic chaplain at Yale University <strong><a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2704" class="external">says</a></strong> there is “great wisdom” in the idea of putting to death those who leave his religion. I suspect he may need to have his brain tampered with, or at least be given a dictionary so that he can learn the meaning of “wisdom”. Here, for example, is a proper example of great wisdom from <strong><em><a href="http://mickhartley.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/asymmetrical-bees.html" class="external">Mick Hartley</a></em></strong>:</p>
  <p>“In these dark days it's somehow comforting to think that someone, somewhere, has been spending their time fitting eye-patches on bees.”</p>
  <p>It is indeed.</p>
