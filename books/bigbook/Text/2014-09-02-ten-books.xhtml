  <h1 id="post-13181">Ten Books</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I was persuaded to take part in one of those Facecloth round-robins, in which I was asked to name ten favourite books “without thinking too hard”. Here is my list (A-Z by author):</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">1. <em>Watt</em>, Samuel Beckett<br />
  2. <em>Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead</em>, Barbara Comyns<br />
  3. <em>The Household Wreck</em>, Thomas De Quincey<br />
  4. <em>Amphigorey</em>, Edward Gorey<br />
  5. <em>The Falls</em>, Peter Greenaway<br />
  6. <em>Bartleby The Scrivener</em>, Herman Melville<br />
  7. <em>Pale Fire</em>, Vladimir Nabokov<br />
  8. <em>W or The Memory Of Childhood</em>, Georges Perec<br />
  9. <em>The Crying Of Lot 49</em>, Thomas Pynchon<br />
  10. <em>The Purple Cloud</em>, M P Shiel</p>
  <p>Do not be confused by No. 5. The screenplay of Greenaway's majestic film is (or was) available in paperback, and takes the form of a continuous piece of prose.</p>
