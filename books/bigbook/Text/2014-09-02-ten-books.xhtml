  <h1 id="post-13181">Ten Books</h1>
  <p>I was persuaded to take part in one of those Facecloth round-robins, in which I was asked to name ten favourite books “without thinking too hard”. Here is my list (A-Z by author):</p>
  
  <ol> 
  <li><em>Watt</em>, Samuel Beckett</li>
  <li><em>Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead</em>, Barbara Comyns</li>
  <li><em>The Household Wreck</em>, Thomas De Quincey</li>
  <li><em>Amphigorey</em>, Edward Gorey</li>
  <li><em>The Falls</em>, Peter Greenaway</li>
  <li><em>Bartleby The Scrivener</em>, Herman Melville</li>
  <li><em>Pale Fire</em>, Vladimir Nabokov</li>
  <li><em>W or The Memory Of Childhood</em>, Georges Perec</li>
  <li><em>The Crying Of Lot 49</em>, Thomas Pynchon</li>
  <li><em>The Purple Cloud</em>, M P Shiel</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Do not be confused by No. 10 The screenplay of Greenaway's majestic film is (or was) available in paperback, and takes the form of a continuous piece of prose.</p>
