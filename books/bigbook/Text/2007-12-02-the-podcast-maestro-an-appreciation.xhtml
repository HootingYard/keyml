  <h1 id="post-293">The Podcast Maestro&nbsp;: An Appreciation</h1>
  <p>You all know by now that there are untold hours of the sound of Mr Key babbling into a microphone available from the <strong><a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/hooting" class="external">ResonanceFM Hooting Yard podcast hub</a></strong>. What may not be clear is that this treasure trove of twaddle is made available to you through the tireless work of unsung yet heroic figures who actually have a grasp of whizzbang 21st century technology (unlike Mr Key). So today I want to pay tribute to the current podcast maestro <a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/marvin-suicide" class="external"><strong>Marvin Suicide</strong></a>, in particular for his choice of photographic illustrations to each programme. This week, for the story <a href="2007-11-15-pancake-hints.xhtml" class="internal" title="Pancake Hints"><strong>Pancake Hints</strong></a>, he has excelled himself. Isn't this fantastic?</p>
