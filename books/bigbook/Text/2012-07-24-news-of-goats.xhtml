  <h1 id="post-9719">News Of Goats</h1>
  <p>Many thanks to Glyn Webster for alerting me to this exciting headline:</p>
  <p><strong><a href="http://m.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10821545" class="external">Fears for goat-man in Utah wild herd</a></strong></p>
  <p>I cannot help wondering if the fellow togged up as a goat might be related to the goat-boy in that favourite children's rhyme, which I am sure all Hooting Yard readers have by heart:</p>
  <p class="verse">Incey-wincey goat-boy, creature of two realms.<br />
  We can see you darting in between the elms.<br />
  Half of you is human, the other half's a goat.<br />
  Incey-wincey goat-boy, drowning in a moat.</p>
