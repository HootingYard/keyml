  <p>At <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/01/behold-the-far-off-luminary/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> the other day I answered the question “Where do you get your ideas from?”</p>
  <p>The other poser regularly aimed at scribblers—and, indeed, bloggers—is “What do you write about? Describe your work to us, in terms a dribbling infant could understand!” I have seen no better a potted summary of Hooting Yard than <strong><a href="http://twistylanes.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/johnnynorms-whimsical-tour-of-the-web-3/" class="external">this piece</a></strong> at <strong><a href="http://twistylanes.wordpress.com/" class="external">Twisty Turny Lanes</a></strong>. Anybody crashing through the rusty iron gates of Hooting Yard for the first time would do well to read it, before devoting the rest of their dismal days to exploring the archives.</p>
  <p>Many thanks to that perceptive fellow Johnnynorms.</p>
