  <h1 id="post-16404">Winklepicker Days</h1>
  <p class="linebreaks">Oh! How I pine for those winklepicker days<br />
  On the pier at Deal<br />
  Like Ingmar Bergman's camera's gaze<br />
  In <em>The Seventh Seal</em><br />
  Yes, I played chess on Deal pier<br />
  Against Death dressed in black<br />
  But I was shod in winklepickers<br />
  And they took Death aback<br />
  I saw envy on his pale white face<br />
  Envy for my shoon<br />
  And I bested Death on the pier at Deal<br />
  Under a Kentish moon</p>
