  <h1 id="post-14458">Delusions And Slurry</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Just a couple of things to attend to today. First, over at <strong><em><a href="http://gruts.com/2016/01/lrb-chortles/" class="external">Gruts</a></em></strong>, Richard Carter quotes some amusing snippets about O. Henry and Osbert Lancaster. One wants to learn much more about the latter's father-in-law. Were the rest of his “numerous” delusions as delightfully specific as the belief that he “had crossed the Channel with Blériot”?</p>
  <p>Second, it has occurred to me that one thing I would really, really like to do is to write a smash hit million-selling pop song about a farmyard mishap, entitled <em>16 Tons Of Slurry</em>.</p>
