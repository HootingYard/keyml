  <p class="verse">Old Farmer Frack! Old Farmer Frack!<br />
  What are you carrying in your sack?<br />
  <em>I've half a dozen weasels in my sack,</em><br />
  <em>Three for Jill and three for Jack.</em><br />
  Are you sure they're weasels and not stoats?<br />
  Or even little baby goats?<br />
  <em>No, they're weasels, of that I'm sure</em><br />
  <em>Now get in the barn and lock the door.</em><br />
  And Old Farmer Frack burns the barn to the ground<br />
  And swings his sack o' weasels round and round<br />
  Then he climbs up to the top of Polkadot Hill<br />
  And gives the sack o' weasels to Jack and Jill<br />
  <em>Oh thank you, thank you, Old Farmer Frack!</em><br />
  <em>We've always wanted weasels in a sack!</em></p>
