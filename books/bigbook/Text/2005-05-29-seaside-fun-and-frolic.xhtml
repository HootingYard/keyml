  <h1>Seaside Fun and Frolic</h1>
  <p>Hal K Wells, author of today's quotation, above, was always the most measured of writers. <em>Black Pool For Hell Maidens</em>—which includes chapters entitled “The Clawed Ghoul”, “House Of Grisly Fear”, and “Mad Pack Of the Maimed” — was the first in his series of guides to British seaside resorts, all of them featuring both “hell maidens” and the enigmatic Raoul. Later titles included <em>Skeg Ness For Hell Maidens</em>, <em>Tot Nes For Hell Maidens</em>, and <em>Raoul And The Hell Maidens Go Wild In Great Yar Mouth</em>.</p>
