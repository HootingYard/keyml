  <h1 id="post-403">Button, Tomato</h1>
  <p>I've decided to start a keeping a note of interesting names as I come across them. First names, for the most part, though spectacular surnames may also earn a place in my collection.</p>
  <p>Two to begin with: Michael Gilleland (“antediluvian, bibliomaniac, and curmudgeon”) at <a href="http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.com/2008/04/ferns-and-dead-languages.html" class="external"><strong>Laudator Temporis Acti</strong></a> reminds us that one of the signatories of the US Declaration of Independence gloried in the name of Button Gwinnet. And ever since I heard him being <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/closeup/the_right_to_be_deaf.shtml" class="external"><strong>interviewed</strong></a> on the radio a few weeks back, I've had a soft spot for deaf activist Tomato Lichy. His assertion that deafness is not a disability is, um, <em>unusual</em>, but his name is Tomato and that's good enough for me.</p>
