  <h1 id="post-7171">Real Orghast</h1>
  <p class="noindent">More from Phil Baker's <strong><a href="http://strangeattractor.co.uk/shoppe/austin-osman-spare-2/" class="external">biography</a></strong> of Austin Osman Spare, one of the chief pleasures of which is its plethora of anecdotes and asides. Such as this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">In the 1960s Ted Hughes and Peter Brook attempted to develop a language called Orghast, effectively a magical language where words would have “a more inevitable relationship to reality”. For example, the Orghast for “darkness opens its womb” (“staple of any phrasebook” as a cynic writes) is BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">I would like to learn and become fluent in Orghast. <strong><a href="http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/theater/orghast.htm" class="external">Apparently</a></strong> it has a vocabulary of some two thousand words, but of these only about fifty count as “real Orghast”, according to Ted Hughes, and he should know. I wonder what the Orghast is for “By ‘eck, Sylvia, when you first kissed me you drew blood”.</p>
  <p>I hope, when I have mastered the fifty magic words, that I do not have the dismissive attitude of Rayner Heppenstall towards another invented language</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">I had never thought highly of Esperanto (my father had once tried to make me learn it, but when I found the word for bird was ‘birdo’ I could no longer take it seriously).</p>
