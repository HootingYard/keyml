  <h1>Chrononhotonthologos</h1>
  <p class="noindent">For many years I believed that the most startling opening line in theatre was Ubu's “Merdre!” in Alfred Jarry's <em>Ubu Roi</em>. But no! What could better this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">These are the opening words of Henry Carey's <em>Chrononhotonthologos</em>, spoken by Rigdum-Funnidos. The play is not unlike <em>Ubu Roi</em>, in that the title character is a greedy, bad-tempered and violent king. (It would have been a great role for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Coates">Robert Coates</a>.) The final scene leaves the stage littered with corpses—this memorable line will give you some idea:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">O horrid! horrible, and horridest horror! Our king! our general! our cook! our doctor! All dead! stone dead! irrevocably dead! O——-h!—— [All groan, a tragedy groan.]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">The play also includes my favourite musical direction, which would not be out of place at the Festival of Argumentative Music at Ülm (see 24th February):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">SCENE—A Bed Chamber. Chrononhotonthologos asleep. [Rough music, Viz. Salt Boxes and Rolling Pins, Grid-Irons and Tongs, Sow-Gelders Horns, Marrow-Bones and Cleavers, c. c.] He wakes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">Henry Carey (c.1687-1743) also wrote, among much else, the words to <em>God Save The King</em> (or <em>Queen</em>). <em>Chrononhotonthologos</em> was so popular in its day that the title entered the language, as a synonym for “furious, violent, demanding, self-centered” (sounds just like Pa Ubu) and appeared in earlier editions of <em>Roget's Thesaurus</em>, although appears not to have made it into the <em>OED</em>.</p>
  <p>You can read the play in full by clicking on the picture of Pa Ubu (for want of a picture of Chrononhotonthologos himself).</p>
