  <h1>Egg Update</h1>
  <p>Back in November, you will recall, we had a <a href="2008-11-28-ova.xhtml" class="internal" title="Ova"><strong>brief look</strong></a> at George Orwell's diary and its—at times—exclusive concentration on egg-counting. I have not seen fit to keep you abreast of the daily totals, confident as I am that you are equally fascinated by this egg business, and thus have added a check of the <a href="http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/" class="external"><strong>online diary</strong></a> to your daily routine. However, the latest seventy-year-old entry is somewhat alarming, so I thought I should draw your attention to it.</p>
  <p><em>26–28.12.38 Have been ill. Not certain about number of eggs, but about 9.</em></p>
  <p>Not certain? Get a grip, George, get a grip!</p>
