  <p class="noindent">You lot need to replace your copies of <em>Dracula</em> by Bram Stoker, and you need to do so <em>right now</em>. Well, actually, make that on Thursday, when the new paperback edition pictured above is published. The reason you need to do so is because this edition is illustrated by my second-born son, <strong><a href="http://edwoodburn.tumblr.com/" class="external">Edwood Burn</a></strong>. It is his first publication, released as he begins the final year of his illustration degree, so it seems to me you ought to go and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dracula-Vintage-Childrens-Classics-Stoker/dp/0099582597/ref=dp_return_2?ie=UTF8&amp;n=266239&amp;s=books" class="external">buy it</a></strong> out of your devoted loyalty to Hooting Yard.</p>
