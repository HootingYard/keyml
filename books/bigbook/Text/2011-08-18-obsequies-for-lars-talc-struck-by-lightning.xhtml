  <p>This is the cover of <em>Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning</em>. It was published in an edition of twenty-five copies in 1994, under the Hooting Yard Press imprint and—save for a brief, rewritten, extract posted <strong><a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/archive/obsequies.htm" class="hootingyard">here</a></strong> some years ago—has never again seen the light of day. It was the last piece of prose I completed before my descent into the maelstrom, or the Wilderness Years, or whatever one wants to call that period of ruination from which I eventually emerged with the launch of the Hooting Yard website in 2003.</p>
  <p>I am planning to republish <em>Obsequies</em>, with the original text unaltered, as the second volume in the Out Of Print Pamphlets Reprinted series, later this year. Meanwhile, I have decided to read the whole thing on the radio, starting with this evening's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air on Resonance104.4FM, continuing next week, and possibly the week after. (I'm not sure how long it will take.)</p>
  <p>Turn on, tune in, pin back your ears, and listen.</p>
