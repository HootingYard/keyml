  <h1>Spade</h1>
  <p>It has been an industrious week at Hooting Yard, what with the publication of a <strong><a href="2011-07-25-porpoises-rescue-dick-van-dyke.xhtml" class="internal" title="Porpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke">brand new paperback</a></strong> and the production of those lovely <strong><a href="2011-07-20-badges.xhtml" class="internal" title="Badges!">lapel accoutrements</a></strong>. Global domination has never seemed so surely within my grasp. Whatever next?, you may ask. Fridge magnets? Monogrammed bomber jackets? Hooting Yard tea-cosies? Tee-shirts?</p>
  <p>Mention of tee-shirts is as good a pretext as any to bring to your attention this splendid (if unrealised) design by recently-deceased Hooting Yard aficionado Martin Clare, recorded by his brother in a <strong><a href="http://www.martinclaremusicfund.org/roland.htm" class="external">funeral tribute</a></strong>.</p>
