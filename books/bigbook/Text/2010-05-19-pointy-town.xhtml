  <h1 id="post-4478">Pointy Town</h1>
  <p>Today's <em>Grauniad</em> has an article asking if Brighton is the “hippest city in Britain”, whatever that might mean. (I have not provided a link to the piece, for I feel sure Hooting Yard readers have better things to do with their time.) I mention it only to note that a far more cogent question would be “Is Pointy Town The Pointiest Town In The Known Universe?” Unfortunately, this would not fill much space in a newspaper, as the answer is quite obviously “Yes, it is”. One could I suppose extrapolate upon the most pointy of the pointy attractions of Pointy Town, and perhaps one day soon I shall do so. But will the <em>Grauniad</em> publish it?</p>
