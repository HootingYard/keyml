  <p class="noindent">“Swinburne… boasted to Burne-Jones that he had ‘discovered the one serious rhyme in the language’ to ‘babe’, which was, not very helpfully, ‘astrolabe’.”</p>
  <p>Mollie Panter-Downes, <em>At The Pines&nbsp;:</em> <em>Swinburne And Watts-Dunton In Putney</em> (1971).</p>
  <p>I was directed to this magnificent and eccentric book by <strong><a href="http://nigeness.blogspot.com/2009/05/at-pines.html" class="external">Nige</a></strong>, who also provides a link to Max Beerbohm's account of his Putney visit.</p>
