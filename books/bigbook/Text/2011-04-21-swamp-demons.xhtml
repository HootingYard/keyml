  <h1 id="post-6464">Swamp Demons</h1>
  <p class="noindent">The weedy, asthmatic, fey and trembling poet Dennis Beerpint has, I am afraid to say, been caught red-handed in an act of blatant plagiarism. The title piece in his latest slim volume of twee verse, <em>Swamp Demons, And Other Demons, And Other Swamps</em>, has been copied word for word from the August-September 1936 issue of <em>Weird Tales</em> magazine, where it was correctly ascribed to the writer C A Butz. Reclining on a divan, feeling faintly ill, Beerpint has refused to comment on his act of poetic perfidy. Here is Butz's original verse.</p>
  <p>The lights that wink across the sodden moor</p>
  <p>Like phosphorescent eyes that beckon men</p>
  <p>To risk fell footsteps in the treacherous fen,</p>
  <p>And sink in loathsome muck, without a spoor —</p>
  <p>What ghosts of former days, what dread allure,</p>
  <p>Abides within this subterranean den?</p>
  <p>Or, reaching out, snares victims to its ken,</p>
  <p>With wraith-like fingers, to a peril sure?</p>
  <p>‘Tis told that evil things lurk out of sight</p>
  <p>With human bones that fester in the ooze;</p>
  <p>Belike 'tis true, these bones that once were clothed</p>
  <p>In fleshly form now harbour deadly spite</p>
  <p>Against the living, and this swamp still brews</p>
  <p>Within its bubbling depths the curse men loathed</p>
  <p>Before they turned to leprous Things of Night!</p>
