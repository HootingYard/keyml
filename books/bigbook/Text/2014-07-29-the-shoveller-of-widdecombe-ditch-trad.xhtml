  <h1 id="post-12882">The Shoveller Of Widdecombe Ditch (Trad.)</h1>
  <p>Shoveller, shoveller, what do you shovel?<br />
  <em>I shovel the muck outside my hovel.</em><br />
  Shoveller, shoveller, lay down your spade,<br />
  Let us go tiptoe throâ€™ a verdant glade.<br />
  <em>Not on your nelly, for shovel I must<br />
  The muck and the filth and the pebbles and dust,<br />
  I must shovel it all into Widdecombe Ditch<br />
  And cover it o'er with tar and pitch.</em><br />
  Shoveller, shoveller, come skip with me<br />
  Round about the linden tree<br />
  We'll skip in circles 'til we drop<br />
  Then go to the kiosk for a drink of pop.<br />
  <em>Away with you, temptress! Siren! Witch!<br />
  I only drink water from Widdecombe Ditch.<br />
  It's black and brackish and tastes quite foul.</em><br />
  Damn you, shoveller! [She turns into an owl.]</p>
