  <h1 id="post-6012">The Editor, His Neighbour, And The Neighbour's Twins</h1>
  <p class="noindent">After reading <strong><a href="http://zmkc.blogspot.com/2011/01/battered-penguins-i.html" class="external">this post</a></strong> at <strong><a href="http://zmkc.blogspot.com/" class="external">ZMKC</a></strong>, it seemed like a good idea to familiarise myself with the work of Honor Tracy. Here is a quick character sketch (of Desmond Marjoribanks, editor of <em>Torch</em>, “some new dynamic weekly that's going to teach us all how to live”) from her novel <em>A Number Of Things</em> (1960):</p>
  <p>“He was a man of about forty with a lofty brow made loftier by hastily retiring hair, and the wide thin mouth, the nutcracker nose and chin that often go with large progressive views: his light blue eyes positively glared with love of humanity, his nostrils expanded and deflated with enthusiasm like those of a passionate horse. He dearly loved resolutions, workers' councils, committees, monster rallies, his children and his second wife. His first wife had thrown herself under a train.”</p>
  <p>His downstairs neighbour, Orlando Figgis, has twin children named Summerskill and Hallucination. I suspect I am going to enjoy this book.</p>
