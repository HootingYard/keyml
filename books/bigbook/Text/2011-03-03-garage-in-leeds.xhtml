  <h1 id="post-6139">Garage In Leeds</h1>
  <p>Reading P J O'Rourke's <em>Holidays In Hell</em> (1988), I learned that in Communist Poland, during the mid-1980s, there was a postpunk band called Garaz w Leeds, or, in English, Garage in Leeds. Had they actually hailed from Leeds, or indeed from anywhere in the UK, this would have been a terrible, terrible name. But precisely because they were languishing behind the Iron Curtain, playing their reportedly very gloomy “Cold Wave” music, I think this is one of the most fantastic band names ever devised. Where are they now, I wonder?</p>
