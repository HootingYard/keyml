  <p>In <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2015/04/letting-off-steam/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week I have a good moan about a couple of current exasperations, the phrase “our NHS” and the word “mum”. The piece ought to have been far more vituperative and indeed unsuitable for family reading, but the editor chose to illustrate it with a photograph of that lovely cuddly character John Lydon, so I suppose it's fortuitous that I toned down my invective.</p>
