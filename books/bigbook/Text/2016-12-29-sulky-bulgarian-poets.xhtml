  <h1 id="post-15092">Sulky Bulgarian Poets</h1>
  <p>Along with the <strong><a href="2016-12-29-a-postcard-from-the-last-century.xhtml" class="internal" title="A Postcard From The Last Century"><em>Undimmed by Death</em></a></strong> postcard, I unearthed another set of six cards from the same era. These are hand-drawn and hand-written, and collectively titled <em>Sulky Bulgarian Poets</em>. Unfortunately, the drawings are cack-handed and the “poems” are atrocious—with one exception. Number 5, “In Fish And Shipping”, is attributed to sulky Bulgarian poet Elvis Targnegescubit, and, though it pre-dates Hooting Yard, I think it is a worthy addition to the canon.</p>
  <p class="verse">In despicable visions of<br />
  An unholy refrigerator,<br />
  Another refrigerator,<br />
  In implacable discussions of<br />
  A swordfish,<br />
  A carp,<br />
  An enormous schooner,<br />
  A small schooner,<br />
  A tiny ship, ship-ette,<br />
  In all these I have said,<br />
  Irrefutably, not once,<br />
  But with venom,<br />
  I am a very fat man.</p>
