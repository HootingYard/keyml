  <p class="noindent">Yesterday, an idea for an <strong><a href="2011-04-13-idea-for-a-ballet.xhtml" class="internal" title="Idea For An Opera">opera</a></strong>. Today, an idea for a ballet, courtesy of the magnificent headline</p>
  <p class="center"><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/12/german-swan-besotted-with-tractor" class="external">Swan ‘falls in love’ with a tractor</a></strong></p>
