  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">In “Der Liedler” (1815), a minstrel saves a maiden from a werewolf by smashing his harp against him and then hurling him over a cliff.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">As noted in <em>The Spectator</em> by Damian Thompson, who adds “Even Schubert couldn't polish this particular turd. Long, corny, cod-mediaeval ballads never showed him at his best.”</p>
