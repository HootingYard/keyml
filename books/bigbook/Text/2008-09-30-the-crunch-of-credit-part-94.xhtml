  <h1 id="post-669">The Crunch Of Credit (Part 94)</h1>
  <p>Hey there Key!, <em>writes the insufferably jaunty Dr Ruth Pastry</em>, The crunch of credit seems to be turning into complete economic meltdown. If you don't believe me, read the papers. Anyway, from my bolt-hole here in the paradise that is an out-of-season English seaside resort, I have a solution to the whole bloody mess. We know, from listening to the news on the wireless, that economists witter on about a “basket of currencies”. No wonder we face fiscal Armageddon if all the money is put in baskets! If everyone did as I do, and kept their cash in a pippy bag, I think we would see a dramatic about-turn in the global economy. Now I am going to take my dog Skippy for a seashore walk. Bye bye.</p>
