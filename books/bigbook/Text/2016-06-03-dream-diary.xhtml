  <h1 id="post-14697">Dream Diary</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Last night, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi_Ofarim" class="external">Abi Ofarim</a></strong> was presented with a sheep.</p>
  <p>There was a broader context to this exciting scene, but alas it was obliterated the instant I awoke. All that remains is a smiling Abi, circa 1967, taking in his arms a non-smiling sheep.</p>
  <p>I would be pleased to hear from any brain-quacks who feel competent to interpret this phantasm.</p>
