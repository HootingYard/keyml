  <h1 id="post-1193">Disaster In A Contemporary Brain</h1>
  <p>I am indebted to the great Max Décharné for drawing to my attention this little-known (to me, unknown) work by H G Wells. The title is foolish enough, but I am particularly fond of that resounding subtitle: <em>Adventures, Poses, Stresses, Conflict, and Disaster in a Contemporary Brain</em>. Somehow I think that deserves an exclamation mark. If any Hooting Yardistas have read it, perhaps they could post a review in the Comments.</p>
