  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“It is bad luck to carry a spade through a house … It is bad luck to travel with a priest; this idea seems to me of Spanish importation; and I am inclined to attribute a similar origin to the strange tropical superstition about the banana, which I obtained, nevertheless, from an Italian. You must not cut a banana, but simply break it with the fingers, because in cutting it you cut the cross. It does not require a very powerful imagination to discern in a severed section of the fruit the ghostly suggestion of a crucifixion.” — Lafcadio Hearn, <em>New Orleans Superstitions</em></p>
