  <p class="noindent">Sound advice from <strong><a href="http://gruts.com/2012/05/20120506/" class="external">Richard Carter</a></strong>&nbsp;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">having a pair of owls in your bathroom could help avoid potential embarrassment when you have guests.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">As he says,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">wouldn't it be utterly awesome to keep a couple of owls in your bathroom, just to impress visitors?</p>

  <p class="noindent">Meanwhile, over at <strong><a href="http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2012/05/monkeys-with-guns.html" class="external">Wonders &amp; Marvels</a></strong>, monkeys at war!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Who were the first monkeys to see action in war? Before the invention of gun powder fire-arms in China (ca 13th century), a 9th century Chinese chronicle (“Yu-yang-tsah-tsu” by Twan Ching-Shih) describes annual battles between soldiers of Po-mi-lan and 300,000 giant rock-throwing apes who came down from the high craggy mountains of the west to ravage crops every spring.</p>
