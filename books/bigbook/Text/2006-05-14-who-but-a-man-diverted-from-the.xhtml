  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Who but a man diverted from the paths of honest feeling and natural enjoyment, possessed of a demoniac mania, lost to the peace and serenity of the virtuous and the blessed, could find pleasure amid the damps, and dews, and chills, and raw-edgedness of a garden in the early morning, absolutely find pleasure in saturated trousers, in shoes swathed in moisture, in skies that are gray and gloomy, in flowers that are, as Mantalini would put it, ‘demnition moist’? The thing is incredible!” — Oliver Bell Bunce, <em>Bachelor Bluff : His Opinions, Sentiments, And Disputations</em></p>
