  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“There should be at least seven servers for Benediction—two acolytes, four torch-bearers, and a thurifer. All will be ready vested in soutane and surplice, wearing altar shoes, with torches lighted and thurible prepared, five minutes before the hour. They will arrange themselves in ranks just outside the priest's sacristy. Whenever, during the time that the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, it is necessary to leave or enter the Sanctuary, a reverence is made on <em>both</em> knees; not, however, when simply passing before the altar.” — Bernard F Page SJ, <em>A Practical Guide For Servers At Low Mass &amp; Benediction</em></p>
