  <h1>Beasts of the Field</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“What in the name of heaven is Kurt Chodd prattling on about?” asks reader P. N. Cowper, “Contrary to the absurd waiting room scene in <em><a class="internal" href="2004-03-14-the-dobson-memorial-lecture-2004.xhtml">The Administration Of Lighthouses</a></em> (9th March), vets do not as a rule tend to the kinds of animals listed there. This lack of verisimilitude ruined the lecture for me, and I am sure for many other readers.” Well: Mr or Ms Cowper is clearly not familiar with James Forbes' <em>Oriental Memoirs (1813-15)</em>, where we find this:</p>
  <p>“The Banian hospital at Surat is a most remarkable institution; it consists of a large plot of ground, enclosed with high walls, divided into several courts or wards, for the accommodation of animals; in sickness they are attended with the tenderest care, and find a peaceful asylum for the infirmities of age. At my visit, the hospital contained horses, mules, oxen, sheep, goats, monkeys, poultry, pigeons, and a variety of birds, with an aged tortoise, who was known to have been there for seventy-five years. The most extraordinary ward was that appropriated to rats, mice, bugs, and other noxious vermin. The overseers of the hospital frequently hire beggars from the streets, for a stipulated sum, to pass a night among the fleas, lice, and bugs, on the express condition of suffering them to enjoy their feast without molestation.”</p>
