  <h1>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From the Stars</h1>
  <h2>Afterword</h2>
  <p>There are a small number of thefts in <em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em> which deserve acknowledgement.</p>
  <p><em>The Courier's Tragedy</em>, scenes from which are engraved on the stolen pipe-rack, is a Jacobean drama by Richard Wharfinger. Both the play and its author were invented by Thomas Pynchon in <em>The Crying Of Lot 49</em>.</p>
  <p>The description of Mister Poxhaven is identical to Mary Shelley's description of the Monster in <em>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</em>.</p>
  <p>Matilda Spamclot's childhood anecdote, beginning “In a late evening” and ending “in the midst of a journey we never began” is the text of a song by Chris Cutler, with music by Lindsay Cooper. It appears on the album <em>Letters Home</em> by News From Babel.</p>
  <p>The title <em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em> is culled from James Hamilton-Paterson's book <em>Playing With Water</em>.</p>
