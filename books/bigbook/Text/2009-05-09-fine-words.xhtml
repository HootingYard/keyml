  <h1 id="post-2450">Fine Words</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I am having to stop myself from copying out vast swathes of Ruskin's <em>Fors Clavigera</em> for your entertainment and edification. How can you not love a writer who refers in passing to looking something up “in one of my thirteenth-century Bibles”? Here, in any case, are a few lines from <em>Letter XXIII, The Labyrinth</em>:</p>
  <p><em>[H]aving been obliged to write too young, when I knew only half truths, [I] was eager to set them forth by what I thought fine words. People used to call me a good writer then; now they say I can't write at all; because, for instance, if I think anybody's house is on fire, I only say “Sir, your house is on fire;” whereas formerly I used to say , “Sir, the abode in which you probably passed the delightful days of youth is in a state of inflammation,” and everybody used to like the effect of the two p's in “probably passed,” and of the two d's in “delightful days”.</em></p>
  <p>I do like them… probably too enthusiastically.</p>
