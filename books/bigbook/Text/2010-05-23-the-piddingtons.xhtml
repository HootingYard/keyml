  <h1 id="post-4498">The Piddingtons</h1>
  <p class="noindent">So, I was thinking, as I so often do, of the golden age of the <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/jul04.htm#2004-07-02-2" class="hootingyard">Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre</a></strong>, and then, over at <strong><a href="http://gawragbag.blogspot.com/2010/05/inhabitants-of-lost-world.html" class="external">Ragbag</a></strong>, I came upon this marvellous list of music hall acts:</p>
  <p>“The joy, perhaps as much in memory as at the time, was in the variousness: the magician Ali Bongo (‘The Shriek of Araby’), the illusionist Cingallee, the pigeon act Hamilton Conrad, the animal and bird impersonator Percy (‘I Travel the Road’) Edwards, the drag act Ford and Sheen, the mind-reader The Amazing Fogel, the lady whistler Eva Kane, the male impersonator Hetty King, the foot spinner and raconteur Tex McLeod, the yodelling accordionist Billy Moore, the human spider Valantyne Napier, the mental telepathists The Piddingtons, the novelty xylophonist Reggie Redcliffe, the speciality dancer Bunty St Clair, the pianist Semprini, the aereliste Olga Varona, and many, many others—inhabitants of a lost world.”</p>
  <p>Later today I will be attempting to contact The Piddingtons, via mental telepathy of course, and I shall keep you informed of the ensuing revelations.</p>
