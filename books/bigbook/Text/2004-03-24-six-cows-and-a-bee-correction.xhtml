  <h1>Six Cows and a Bee&nbsp;: Correction</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Due to a production error, the text and pictures which appeared under the heading “Six Cows And A Bee” on Friday 19th March were completely erroneous. Wool from Mrs Gubbins' knitted tea-cosy began to unravel and somehow became entangled in the mainframe, leading to all sorts of hoo-ha. The headline was meant to a refer to a piece about the debut performance of a new pop group of that name. We hope to run the article as soon as we can spring Mrs Gubbins from chokey (see yesterday), although I have to admit that things are running quite smoothly in her absence.</p>
