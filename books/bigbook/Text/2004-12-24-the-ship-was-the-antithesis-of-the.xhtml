  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The ship was the antithesis of the floating palace we had left… White-collar workers, adventurers, toughs, would-be toughs, and leather-faced old scoundrels crowded every foot of available space, and when walking up and down the deck we had to dodge foul squirts of tobacco-juice. Their chief occupations were drinking and playing ruinous crap games, and the noise that went on all the time made my study of Spanish grammar a difficult matter.” — Lt Col P H Fawcett, <em>Exploration Fawcett</em></p>
