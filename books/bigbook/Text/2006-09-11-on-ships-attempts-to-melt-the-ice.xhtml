  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“On ships, attempts to melt the ice by buckets of hot water or by steam jets are only partially effective, because a great deal of heat is needed to melt a little ice. Further, if the temperature is still below freezing point when the operation is being carried out, the melted ice may freeze again unless it can be pushed overboard first. Mechanical detachment of the ice is no easy matter, for ice adheres most tenaciously to clean, grease-free surfaces and a ship has often been thoroughly de-greased by wind-swept rain and spray before it becomes iced-up.” — G Van Praagh, <em>De-Icing Of Ships</em></p>
