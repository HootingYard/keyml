  <p class="noindent">Word of the day&nbsp;: Boggle.</p>
  <p>I am afraid that before we move on to <em>boggle</em>, we have unfinished business with yesterday's word of the day, <em>parp</em>. Reader Wlad Onanugu writes&nbsp;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Dear Wordmaestro, I am confused by your maunderings on the word <em>parp</em>. You say it is pretty much identical to <em>toot</em>, but then proceed, in your illustrative sentence, to refer to a <em>hooter</em>, rather than, as I might have expected, a <em>tooter</em> or <em>parper.</em> My mental chaos is compounded by the fact that you also make mention of <em>tots</em>, virtually the same word as <em>toots</em>, though entirely different in meaning. I looked forward to improving my word power with your new series. Instead I find myself quite dreadfully unhinged.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">Mr Onanugu will find it helpful to consult Dobson's pamphlet <em>Parp. Toot, Hooter, Tooters, Parpers And Tots&nbsp;: A Complete Guide For The Bewildered</em> (out of print). I have not read it myself, but am told it is almost, but not quite, “the greatest pamphlet ever written”.</p>
