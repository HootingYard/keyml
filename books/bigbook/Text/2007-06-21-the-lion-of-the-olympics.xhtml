  <h1 id="post-213">The Lion Of The Olympics</h1>
  <p>I have been giving further thought to <a href="2007-06-05-that-olympics-logo.xhtml" class="internal" title="That Olympics Logo">that logo</a>—or <em>brand</em>—for the 2012 Olympics. Clearly the £400,000 design is a hideous mistake and will have to be ditched and replaced at some point within the next five years. My own view is that the organising committee ought to take a cheerful, jolly image from an <em>already proven</em> successful brand, slap the Olympic rings on it somewhere, and have done with it. What could be better than a picture of a lion being attacked by a swarm of Africanised killer bees?</p>
