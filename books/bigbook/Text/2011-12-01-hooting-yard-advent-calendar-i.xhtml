  <h1 id="post-7745">Hooting Yard Advent Calendar (i)</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I think it is about time I treated you lot to a Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. Each day between now and Christmas Day I will post a picture. The idea is that you get a big sheet of cardboard and hang it up on an inner wall of your hovel. Then, each day, you can print the picture posted here onto a sheet of paper, cut it out, and glue it to the sheet of cardboard. Watch in delight as the pictures multiply!</p>
  <p>We start today with a colour photograph of a drainage ditch, courtesy of <strong><a href="http://fiveislandsorchard.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/recent-photos/" class="external">Five Islands Orchard</a></strong>.</p>
