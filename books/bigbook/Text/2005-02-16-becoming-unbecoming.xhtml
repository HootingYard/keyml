  <h1>Becoming Unbecoming</h1>
  <p>To become unbecoming, you must learn what is meet—which is moot—and then go against it. Get a book of etiquette. Where it says do, don't, and where it says don't, do. When you can do or don't with practised ease your conduct will be unbecoming. To become becoming again, simply undo the don'ts and do's. By the by, why what is meet is moot is because conventions vary. And remember your catechismus:</p>
  <p>Q—What do I not give for convention?</p>
  <p>A—A jot</p>
