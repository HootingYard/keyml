  <h1 id="post-13241">If You Go Away</h1>
  <p class="noindent">If you go away, like I know you will, I will take the vase from the windowsill, and I'll take the blooms that are shoved in it, and I'll throw them out, 'cause you're such a git, if you go away, if you go away, if you go away.</p>
  <p>But if you stay, I'll give you some hay, I'll give you some straw, I'll lean on the fence, like the peasant I am, on my filthy farm, where the pigs are all sick, and the horses all limp, through the mud and the muck, as the rain pours in sheets, relentless and wet, like rain usually is, when it falls from the clouds, like the clouds in my brain, inside my glum head, the colour of curd, under my woolly hat, that's soaking and drenched, like my waterlogged boots, tied with frayed lengths of string, which are spattered with blood, from the butcher's shop, where I stole them for you, to wrap up your gifts, the hay and the straw, but used instead, to tie up my boots, when you went away, when you went away, when you went away.</p>
