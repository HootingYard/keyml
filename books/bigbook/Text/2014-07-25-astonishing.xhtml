  <h1 id="post-12838">Astonishing</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I was intrigued by this snippet in the diary column of the <em>Guardian</em>. Yesterday, we were told, was</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">the feast day of Christina the Astonishing, a 12th century Belgian saint who could fly and occasionally lived in holes, ovens, and ponds while preaching.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">Clearly I am going to have to do further research, and when I have, I will let you lot know what I have discovered.</p>
