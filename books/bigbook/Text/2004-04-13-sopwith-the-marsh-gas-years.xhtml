  <h1>Sopwith&nbsp;: The Marsh Gas Years</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Claude Sopwith is the only one of Dobson's associates to have his biography written by the great pamphleteer. Dobson devoted a full eighteen-month period (October 1962 to March 1964) to the task. Such concentration on a single subject was unusual for Dobson—a notorious flibbertigibbet—but then Sopwith's was an unusual life. Following his trajectory from an orphanage in Borneo to a futuristic “pod” on the outskirts of Bodger's Spinney, via stints as an insurance salesman, bird expert, jewel-encrusted mountebank, and trainer of seals (among innumerable other escapades), following him from continent to continent, now in one guise, now in another, was a highly ambitious undertaking, and one perhaps unsuitable for a temperament such as Dobson's. The planned <em>Life</em> was never, of course, completed, but with Marigold Chew busy at the printing press, Dobson issued several pamphlets in the early 1960s, each a fragment of the projected work. The idle reader, stumbling upon one of these dog-eared tracts in a seaside junk shop, may not realise that Sopwith is even the subject. After all, Dobson's prose style at this period has been described by Poxhaven as “incomprehensible”. Nonetheless, readers will I am sure be intrigued by this all-too-brief excerpt:</p>

Observing his eerily waxen forearms, that [illegible] priest had suggested a remedy of cornflakes and glucose tablets. He had lost his bus pass, but he no longer knew the bus routes. What was that dream Leonardo da Vinci had about a vulture? Well, he had that dream too, except in his case the image that lingered, as he awoke, was of twigs, thousands upon thousands of twigs, all sticky with birdlime, piled up in a tottering heap, and his docent, juddering, just vanishing behind them, waving a brightly-coloured scarf embroidered with uncanny visions of Swedenborgian splendour…</em></p>
