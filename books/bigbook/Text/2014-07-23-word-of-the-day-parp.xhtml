  <p>Word of the day&nbsp;: Parp.</p>
  <p><em>Parp</em> is a verb, pretty much identical to <em>toot</em>. Here is an illustrative sentence: <em>In an apoplexy of rage, he parped his hooter</em>. To act out this sentence, for example in a classroom full of tots, you will need a hooter. You should also smear your face with beetroot juice to give it that “purple with rage” look, and be able to boggle your eyes convincingly. Tomorrow we will consider the word Boggle.</p>
