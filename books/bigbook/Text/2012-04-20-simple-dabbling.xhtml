  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2012/04/simple-simon/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> today, I examine an episode from the life of the noted simpleton, Simple Simon. His adversary, the pieman, also appears in this tale, and not, it must be said, in a good light. As in all the best fables, a moral is drawn at the end, though not a very enlightening one.</p>
