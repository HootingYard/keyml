  <h1>Another Tiny Enid</h1>
  <p>We already knew there was a <strong><a href="2008-12-18-tiny-enid.xhtml" class="internal" title="Tiny Enid">hen</a></strong> called Tiny Enid. Now it has come to my attention that, in the USA, there is a Dalmatian puppy also named after the plucky tot. Matt and Mandy (whomsoever they may be) are to be congratulated on their excellent pet-naming skills. Visit their <strong><a href="http://dropmystraw.blogspot.com/2009/06/like-i-need-another-reason-for-people.html" class="external">Drop My Straw</a></strong> blog and you can see both a photo and a video of the canine Tiny Enid.</p>
