  <p>Over in my cupboard at <em><strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/03/the-miliband-resignation/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></strong></em> today I try, as best I can, to come to terms with the most seismic event in our national life for centuries. I am not ashamed to admit that I wept, <em>wept</em> I tell you!, and copious were my tears, and salty were they too, at the self-willed downfall of perhaps the one true political colossus of the past five hundred years.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, it might be that, with <em>The Miliband Resignation</em>, I was trying my hand at devising a convincing Robert Ludlum-style title, in preparation for a forthcoming cinema franchise. But who would star as David Miliband?</p>
