  <p class="noindent">“I have already been subject to abuse and physical attack (pelting with so-called ‘organic’ vegetables etc.) because of my genetic engineering experiments: eg, my production of a new type of electronic bread, enriched with GMOs, which turns into toast on a voiced command.—Paul Ohm, Atomdene, Edgbaston”</p>
  <p>From <em>Peter Simple's Century</em> by Michael Wharton (1999)—my aeroplane reading yesterday, crossing the Atlantic. I have never before read the uberreactionary Wharton, who is extremely funny and, I learn, was noting the activities of Aztec fundamentalists long before me.</p>
