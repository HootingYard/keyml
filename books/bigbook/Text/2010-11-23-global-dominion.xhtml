  <h1 id="post-5601">Global Dominion</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Hooting Yard's campaign for global dominion continues apace with the first of four “sponsored” episodes of Norm Sherman's <strong><a href="http://web.me.com/normsherman/Site/Podcast/Podcast.html" class="external">Drabblecast</a></strong> fiction podcast. Hear Mr Key read a story with added music and sound effects! My thanks are due to Norm and to Salim Fadhley. Follow the <strong><a href="http://web.me.com/normsherman/Site/Podcast/Podcast.html" class="external">link</a></strong> and home in on episode 188, and remember there are three more to come, each with Hooting Yard-related enticements.</p>
