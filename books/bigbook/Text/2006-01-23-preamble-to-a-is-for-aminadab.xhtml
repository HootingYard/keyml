  <h1>Preamble to <em>A Is for Aminadab</em></h1>
  <p class="noindent"><em>The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet</em> was a pamphlet about an immense duckpond, as opposed to an immense pamphlet about a duckpond. The text consists of twenty six chapters, lettered from A to Z. It was published in pamphlet form late in the last century, and as I am still fond of it I have decided to add it here, in serial form. So for the next twenty six days this spine-tingling work of duckpondiana will appear, chapter by chapter. I have made a few amendments to the original text, where it was less than felicitous, or where I could see room for improvement.</p>
  <p>Here is a picture of the original title page, which should be studied with due care.</p>
