  <h1 id="post-13231">Tooting My Own Trumpet</h1>
  <p>This is the Age of Unbridled Narcissism, but Mr Key is of course a diffident and unassuming fellow. However, I would like to draw to your attention the programme for <strong><a href="http://www.devourfest.com/program/soul-of-a-banquet-wa-recipe-for-gruel/" class="external">Devour! The Food Film Fest</a></strong>, to be held in Wolfville, Nova Scotia in November. Among the films to be shown is Sharon Smith's splendid adaptation of <strong><em><a href="http://www.misshathorn.com/my-film/" class="external">A Recipe For Gruel</a></em>,</strong> described thus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Animated and described cleverly by the best British voice you have ever heard, <em>A Recipe for Gruel</em> will charm and inform, but mostly charm.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Er â€¦ to be precise, it was animated by Sharon (aka Miss HatHorn) and narrated by Mr Key, but I am flattered by such praise. In case you have no idea what the Nova Scotians are talking about, you can listen to untold hours of that voice babbling away at the <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> <strong><a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/hooting" class="external">archives</a></strong> at Resonance104.4FM.</p>
  <p>When it has done the rounds of the film festivals, food-related and otherwise, <em>A Recipe For Gruel</em> will be available to watch online. I shall keep you informed.</p>
