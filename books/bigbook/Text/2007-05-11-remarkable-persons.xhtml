  <p class="noindent">I hope that all Hooting Yard readers have become devotees of the magnificent <a href="http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.com" class="external">BibliOdyssey</a>. Today the site has a particularly splendid set of <a href="http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.com/2007/05/remarkable-persons.html" class="external">Remarkable Persons</a>:</p>
  <p>“John Bigg, the Dinton Hermit, baptized 22nd of April, 1629, buried 4th of April, 1696. He lived [..] in a cave, had been a man of tolerable wealth, was looked upon as a pretty good scholar, and of no contemptible parts. Upon the restoration he grew melancholy, betook himself to a recluse life, and lived by charity, but never asked for any thing but leather, which he would immediately nail to his clothes. He kept 3 bottles that hung to his girdle, viz. for strong and small beer, and milk; his shoes are still preserved; they are very large, and made up of about a thousand patches of leather.”</p>
