    <p class="caption">It may be a little quiet here for a few days while I watch my flocks and muck about with gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and stare at a star, and other such important activities. I will, however, try to post the traditional Hooting Yard pictorial Christmas greeting tomorrow, if I can find something suitable.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Meanwhile, over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2010/12/a-tale-from-keys-christmas-cupboard/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, you can find a seasonal tale exhumed from the Archives. Devoted readers will probably have it by heart, and be ready to recite it to the tinies at bedtime, but I learned that apparently there are a few visitors to The Dabbler who have <em>not</em> spent the past six months poring over the accumulated treasures of Hooting Yard (2003â€“2010), so we must help them get up to speed before the new year.</p>
