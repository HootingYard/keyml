  <p>Make sure you tune in to Resonance today, between noon and midnight, for the second half of the <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/fundraiser" class="external">Fundraiser Weekend Marathon</a></strong>. Mr Key will be on air from 1.30 to 2.00 PM announcing the auction of <em>Derek The Dust Particle</em>, <em>Bring Me The Head Of Derek The Dust Particle!</em>, and a complete set of <em>Massacre</em>, issues one to five of the anthologies published in the 1990s. I think bidding for items, by telephone, email, or metal tapping machine, continues until midnight, but all will become clear if you listen carefully.</p>
