  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Sophistry might shake, blandishment bend, sex-affinity blight, but Jerry would stand like an oak, its young leaves among the stars, its roots deep in mother earth. Marcia Van Wyck, her black damask boudoirs, her tinted finger tips, her Freud, Strindberg and all the rest of her modern trash—there would come a day when Jerry would laugh at them!” — George Gibbs, <em>Paradise Garden&nbsp;: The Satirical Narrative of a Great Experiment</em></p>
