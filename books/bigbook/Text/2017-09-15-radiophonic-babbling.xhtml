  <p>There are now more than 100 episodes of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> available for your listening pleasure on Mixcloud. This means you could shove some headphones over your ears and listen to Mr Key babbling for two whole days without a break, and there would still be more to come. What bliss!</p>
  <p>Yesterday the umpteenth series began with <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-14th-september-2017/" class="external"><strong>this thrilling broadcast</strong></a>. Please note that the audio remains obstinately silent until about one minute in, due to technical gubbins beyond my puny understanding. Thereafter, you can listen to readings of <a href="2017-07-30-when-i-was-borp.xhtml" class="internal" title="When I Was Borp"><strong>When I Was Borp,</strong></a> <a href="2017-08-01-expulsion-of-the-fools-from-the-orchard.xhtml" class="internal" title="Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard"><strong>Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchsrd</strong></a>, <a href="2017-08-03-pierre-et-clothilde.xhtml" class="internal" title="Pierre Et Clothilde"><strong>Pierre Et Clothilde</strong></a>, <a href="2017-08-04-pierre-et-les-pantoufles.xhtml" class="internal" title="Pierre Et Les Pantoufles"><strong>Pierre Et Les Pantoufles</strong></a> (featuring Plastic Bertrand) and <a href="2017-08-06-the-pauper-and-the-princeling-and-the-pea.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Pauper And The Princeling And The Pea"><strong>The Pauper And The Princeling And The Pea</strong></a>.</p>
