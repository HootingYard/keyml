  <h1>A Pedant Writes</h1>
  <p>A letter from Tim Thurn.</p>
  <p>Dear Mr Key&nbsp;: In the piece entitled <em>The Bilgewater Elegies</em> (26th July), there is a glaring narrative error. Dobson counts flags during his taxi ride from the seaport to the chalet, but a few lines later we learn that he kept his eyes shut throughout the journey. I cannot be the only reader to abhor such errors, which quite ruined the piece. Close study of writers such as Dennis Wheatley, Anthony Burgess, and Tobias Smollett will help you to avert such howlers in future. Yours ever, Tim Thurn</p>
  <p>What Mr Thurn fails to realise is that the piece he refers to was written according to the strict rules of Dobsonian Ãœbertexts, as outlined in the out-of-print pamphlet <em>Some Thoughts About Shabby Taverns, Cows And The 1958 Munich Air Disaster Which Wiped Out The Flower Of Post-War English Football, Although Sir Matt Busby Survived The Crash, Praise The Lord</em>. Read and learn, Tim, read and learn.</p>
