  <h1 id="post-2488">Some Words From Inside A Barrel</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Mr Key has lately been described, <strong><a href="http://www.rermegacorp.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=RM&amp;Product_Code=ReRVril2&amp;Category_Code=CU" class="external">elsewhere</a></strong>, as a “Diogenesian recluse”. There is an element of truth in this. How many readers were aware that the material at Hooting Yard issues forth from inside a barrel, or large tub? Now you know.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> For those following the link above, further details of <em>The Fatal Duckpond</em>—in the form of a blatant advertisement—will appear here when it is actually available (soon, as far as I'm aware).</p>
