  <h1>A Guide to Pointy Town&nbsp;: Part One</h1>
  <p>Pointy Town lies just south of the Port of Tongs, and is famous for its amusing biscuits &amp; cakes, dustbin exhibitions, ferocious geese, horrible icing-sugar jewellery, kaleidoscopic lettuce museum (never open), public quacking recitals, squalor, tortoises, utopian vinegar works, &amp; xanthous (yellow) zanies. The few squares that existed in Pointy Town before the revolution were used as ostrich colonies and horse laundries rather than, as they are today, places of lasciviousness and grotesquerie. The Triumph of Marmalade Square, in particular, fenced round with a rude wooden railing, interrupted by lumpish brick piers at intervals of every half-dozen yards, partakes more of the character of a pond than a parterre; and as for Kevin Costner Square, it has very much the air of a sorry cow-yard, where blackguards are to be seen assembled daily, playing at husselcap up to their ankles in mire.</p>
