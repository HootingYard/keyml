  <h1 id="post-3960">Notes Towards A Dictionary Of Great Composers</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Here are two things I learned today, which, taken together, have planted in my brain the idea of writing <em>A Dictionary Of Great Composers</em>. These would be the complete entries for those named, and dozens, nay, hundreds of others would be similarly brief:</p>
  <p><em>Schubert, Franz.</em> Upon his deathbed, his final wish was that someone would bring him some books by James Fenimore Cooper.</p>
  <p><em>Tippett, Michael.</em> He referred to the refrigerator in his kitchen as “Bernard Levin”.</p>
