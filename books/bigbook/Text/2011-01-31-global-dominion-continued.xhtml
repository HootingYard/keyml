  <h1 id="post-5955">Global Dominion (Continued)</h1>
  <p class="noindent">And still the onward march of Hooting Yard into every nook and cranny in the universe continues, unstoppable! The latest place we have wormed our way into is the <strong><em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.okfn.org/2011/01/31/christopher-smarts-jubilate-agno/" class="external">Public Domain Review</a></em></strong>, a project of the <strong><em><a href="http://okfn.org/" class="external">Open Knowledge Foundation</a></em></strong>. The <em>Public Domain Review</em> is, as it says, “exactly what it says on the tin: a web-based review of works which have entered the public domain. Each week an invited contributor presents an interesting or curious work with a brief accompanying text giving context, commentary and criticism.”</p>
  <p>This week's invited contributor is your very own Mr Key, who was asked to write a brief piece introducing that inimitable masterpiece <em>Jubilate Agno</em>. The lovely people at the <em>Review</em> have added the audio of the legendary ResonanceFM recording (an <strong><a href="2011-01-31-global-dominion-continued.xhtml" class="internal" title="Jubilate Agno&nbsp;: The Outtake">outtake</a></strong> of which appeared here the other day), so now you know exactly what to do with the next three hours of your nasty, brutish and short life.</p>
  <p><strong>ADDENDUM&nbsp;:</strong> On the subject of global dominion, WordPress keeps me alerted to mentions of Hooting Yard wherever and whenever they occur. And today, I am pleased—albeit rather beflummoxed—to learn that <strong><a href="http://www.unthinkableconsulting.com/" class="external">Unthinkable Consulting</a></strong>, on its ‘delicious’ feed, recommends the “offbeat brilliance” of Hooting Yard, “an example of a gift-based literary business model”. Well, at long bloody last. Ever since I started tippy-tapping the contents of this website over seven years ago, I have been waiting for somebody to acknowledge that, all along, I have been constructing a gift-based literary business model, daddy-o.</p>
