  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Tasmania shows us her animal freak, the platypus paradoxus, the beast with a bill, first cousin to our tailors and butchers, all of whom are beasts with bills. Our own country has added to the philatelic ‘zoo’ by placing a herd of cattle on one of the Trans-Mississippi issue. That it is a pretty picture cannot be denied but the connection between cows and postage stamps is not obvious.” — John N Luff, <em>What Philately Teaches</em></p>
