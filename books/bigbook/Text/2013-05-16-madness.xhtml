  <h1 id="post-11441">Madness</h1>
  <p>I am currently reading blockbusting paperback bestseller <em>Gone Girl</em> by Gillian Flynn. It's a page-turning thriller which I am much enjoying, in a blockbusting paperback bestseller page-turning thriller kind of way. But I reach page 260, and lo! there is a sudden and awful clunk! Until now, all the dialogue has been believable—you can imagine the characters speaking the words Ms Flynn puts in their mouths. But would anyone, in any circumstances, ever, say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“I think that's it. Yes, Amy is using a Madness song to give me a clue to my own freedom, if only I can decipher their wily, ska-infused codes.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I shall be looking for opportunities to say this as often as possible in future.</p>
