  <h1>Trenchmore &amp; The Cushion Dance</h1>
  <p>“In Queen Eliz: time, Gravitie and state was kept upp. In King James time things were pretty well. But in K. Charles time there has binn nothing but Trenchmore &amp; the Cushion dance, Omnium gatherum, tolly polly, hoyte come toyte.”</p>
  <p><em>The Table-Talk Of John Selden</em> (1689)</p>
  <p>Apropos Brit's <strong><a href="2010-09-01-77-words.xhtml" class="internal" title="77 Words">history of Britain 1939–2010 in seventy-seven words</a></strong>, clearly things have been going to pot for a long, long time. Tolly polly and hoyte come toyte indeed! What fresh hell will yet assail us?</p>
  <p><strong>ADDENDUM&nbsp;:</strong> In 1652, John Evelyn complained of “the depraved youth of <em>England</em>, whose prodigious <em>disbaucheries</em> and late unheard of extravagancies far surpasse the madnesse of all other <em>civilized Nations</em> whatsoever”.</p>
