  <h1>Hubs</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Some while ago I had cause to mention the new fad for appointing Tsars (see 28 July). Another word which seems to hold our leaders in its thrall is “hub”. I live near a hub, apparently, or at least a hub-to-be, though quite when official hubdom is to be conferred on it is uncertain. Perhaps the most preposterous use of the word in its new senseless sense is one I heard on the television news yesterday. Those places where children go to be educated will no longer be known by that fuddy-duddy term “schools” in bright new Britain… no, they will become “community hubs”. Let's hope Alice Cooper can be persuaded to release an updated <em>Community Hub's Out</em>. Onward and upward!</p>
