  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The Punans add some picturesque incidents. According to their version, a huge helmeted hornbill (<em>Rhinoplax vigil</em>) sits by the far end of the bridge across the river of death, and with its screams tries to terrify the ghost, so that it shall fall from the bridge into the jaws of the great fish which is in league with the bird. On the other side of the river is Ungap, a woman with a cauldron and spear. Ungap, if appeased with a gift, aids the ghost to escape from the monstrous bird and fish. Pebbles or beads are put in the nostrils of the Punan corpse in order that they may be presented to Ungap.” — Charles Hose &amp; William McDougall, <em>The Pagan Tribes Of Borneo</em></p>
