  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“James I, at the beginning of his reign, to gratify the people, published a book of sports, of which the women had some time before participated on Sunday evenings, but which had been prohibited. These sports consisted of dancing, ringing, wrestling, and other profanations of that day, and which had risen to such a height that the land would have been deluged with immorality, if Charles I had not wisely shown his piety, by totally abolishing them.” — <em>The Mirror of Literature, Amusement and Instruction, Vol. 19, No. 553, 23rd June 1832</em></p>
