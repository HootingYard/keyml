  <p>Mr Key is very pleased to announce that he will be reading a couple of (short) stories as part of a night of live radio art presented by the Resonance Radio Orchestra at the Jellyfish Theatre on Sunday the third of October. Tickets are just Â£5, and doors open at 7.30 PM.</p>
  <p>The Jellyfish Theate is a temporary structure built of pallets and discarded doors and old nails. You can read about it <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/aug/16/junkitecture-jellyfish-theatre-kaltwasser-kobberling" class="external">here</a></strong> and find out where it is <strong><a href="http://www.oikosproject.com/about-2/" class="external">here</a></strong>.</p>
