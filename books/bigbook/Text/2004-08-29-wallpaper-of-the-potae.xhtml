  <h1>Wallpaper of the Potae</h1>
  <p>This is an important new series in which we will be showing you the decorative wallpaper choices of various Potae. (Please note that we prefer <em>Potae</em> to <em>Potuses</em> for the plural of <em>Potus</em>, which is of course the correct manner of referring to the President Of The United States.) For security reasons we have only been given clearance to show a small patch of each wallpaper design. Here is a sample from Richard Milhous Nixon's White House rumpus room:</p>
