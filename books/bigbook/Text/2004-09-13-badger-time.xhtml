  <h1>Badger Time</h1>
  <p class="noindent">A letter arrives from Poppy Nisbet:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Dear Mr. Key, Further to Mr. Décharné's fascinating item about the Dachshund's artistic abilities (7 September), I wonder if you might find work for your mystically-disgraced small badger, Little Severin, as an artist's model? I am certain he could be reasonably still-ish while being drawn, or even painted, and I feel he deserves a second chance. He is, after all, a very small badger, and it is not his fault if his behaviour was misconstrued as “mystic” by ne'er-do-well impresarios hungry for a victim to exploit. Yours concernedly, Poppy Nisbet</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">Well, Poppy, it's true that Little Severin the Mystic Badger turned out to be not so mystic after all, although rumours flying about at Haemoglobin Towers have it that he correctly forecast the medal winners in the recent Olympic men's polevaulting event (though not in the right order). On the other hand, maybe he was just scrubbling about in the undergrowth foraging for tasty grubs. Who can say? In any event, we have taken your advice and Little Severin is now earning his keep posing not, I am afraid to say, for paintbrush wielding Dachshunds, but as a full time model for human children at the Lancashire Badger Group. Here he is, seen twice, in a painting by Rachael Moodie, aged six.</p>
