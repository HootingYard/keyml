  <p class="noindent">A letter arrives from Kimika Ying:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Dear Mr. Key&nbsp;: I came across the following picture today which struck me as remarkably familiar, and words from one of your earlier writings came to mind:</p>
    <p>“<em>Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen</em> voots <em>to a bucolic hamlet..”</em></p>
    <p>You may well have seen this photo before, but while it was on my mind I wanted to take a moment to thank you for making the world a more surreal place. Listening to Hooting Yard is always a pleasure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">I had not seen the picture before, and nor did I recall the piece Ms Ying quoted—not surprisingly, as it is nine years old, appearing here in March 2004. Here are both the photograph (from this <strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83287853@N00/94300411/" class="external">source</a></strong>) and my elderly tale, <em>What's On In Mustard Parva</em>.</p>

  <p class="noindent">My diving helmet is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week, on Friday afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen <em>voots</em> to a bucolic hamlet called Mustard Parva.</p>
  <p>(Curiously, there is no neighbouring village named Mustard Magna, although a rustic barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of <em>gaar</em> in the local <em>gaar</em>-pot drinking hut told me that there had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this toothless derelict said, the sizeable cluster of wooden buildings known as Mustard Magna had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them, driven insane by ergot poisoning, each bear capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling with a single thwack from its mighty paw. Two hours after the first bear lumbered across Sawdust Bridge, the village was completely obliterated. It is still shown on some maps.)</p>
  <p>Jamming my bicycle into a kiosk on Mustard Parva's Yoko Ono Boulevard, I join six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. Huddled together in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot, we discuss our diving helmets and take lamentably inaccurate minutes which are published regularly through the good offices of the <em>Mustard Parva Thing</em>, whose editor is none other than the blind cousin of Marigold Chew.</p>
