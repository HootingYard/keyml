  <h1>Andrewmotionopoly</h1>
  <p>The exciting wordgame Andrewmotionopoly is closely allied to the equally thrilling pastime Johnfowlesopoly (see 23rd March and 1st April). As in the latter, the idea is to compose a text containing all the adjectives in a prescribed list—in this case, those in the above Blathwayt quotation. However, this time, instead of devising a bedtime story suitable for tiny tots, the challenge is to compose a poem worthy of our titanically talented Poet Laureate. To assist readers wishing to contribute verses or doggerel to a forthcoming Andrewmotionopoly Anthology, here are those adjectives in alphabetical order: airy, busy, clean-shaven, clever, energetic, handsome, inquisitive, interesting, light, little, mobile, perpetual, sarcastic, sharp, slight, special, thin. Seventeen adjectives in two sentences is quite a feat. Your poem, however, can be as long as you like, so long as you include all those adjectives, which must appear once and once only. Extra admiration will be showered upon entries which include the (non-compulsory) phrase “waving in the air”. So set to work, readers!</p>
