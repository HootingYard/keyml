  <h1 id="post-16566">The Dunst Comparator</h1>
  <p class="noindent">This year's foopball World Cup coincided with the Hooting Yard shutdown, which means I have neglected to keep you lot apprised of the choice witterings of commentators. Each time there is a big foopball tournament, we find ourselves wondering if one of the TV babblers will say anything to match that classic observation from 2010&nbsp;: “For a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who'd just plopped out of the womb.”</p>
  <p>My favourite moment from this year came early in the contest. Commenting on one of the Argentinian players, the BBC man said&nbsp;: “He's five-foot-five, the same height as Kirsten Dunst. A dangerous little winger.”</p>
  <p>Was he in possession of a chart matching the heights of foopballers to Hollywood stars? Or is a foopballer's height relative to Kirsten Dunst a standard measure? These questions were never answered, more's the pity.</p>
