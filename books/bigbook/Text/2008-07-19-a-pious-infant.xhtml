  <h1 id="post-485">A Pious Infant</h1>
  <p>If, like me, you are unreasonably obsessed with the weird goings-on in the Anglican church, you might have discovered the blog being tapped out by <a href="http://canterburytalesfromthefringe.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-arrive-at-st.html" class="external"><strong>Bishop Gene Robinson</strong></a><strong>*</strong>. I am certainly pleased that I stumbled upon it, for I have learned about Saint Rumwold.</p>
  <p>Saint Rumwold was born at King's Sutton in AD 662, the son of Saint Cyneburga and King Alchfrid. His first words, on the day he was born, were “I am a Christian”. He then asked to be baptised, and to receive Holy Communion. The next day he preached a sermon, quoting freely from Scripture. On the third day he addressed another sermon, to his parents, and then he keeled over and died. A pious infant indeed.</p>
  <p>Possibly even more pious than Edward Gorey's Henry Clump…</p>

  <p><strong>*</strong><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> Pansy Cradledew has asked me to point out that Bishop Gene Robinson, a gay bishop, should not be confused with Gay Bishop, the TV newsreader who sometimes presents news items about gay bishops.</p>
