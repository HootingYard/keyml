  <h1>Summertime</h1>
  <p>British Summer Time begins today. The clocks go forward by one hour, unless you believe <em>The Guardian</em>, which helpfully advised readers to turn their clocks back. As a result, thousands of people will be late for the traditional ceremony marking the start of summer, due to take place in thousands, if not millions, of homes across the land.</p>
