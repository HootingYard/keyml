  <h1>Ova</h1>
  <p>In <strong><em><a href="2008-09-03-diaries-of-the-dead.xhtml" class="internal" title="Diaries Of The Dead">Diaries Of The Dead</a></em></strong>, I mentioned that <strong><a href="http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/" class="external">George Orwell's diaries</a></strong> are being posted online as a daily blog. They are magnificent, in a quite unexpected way. Here are some—unedited—entries for seventy years ago:</p>
  <p>16.11.38 One egg.</p>
  <p>17.11.38 One egg.</p>
  <p>19.11.38 Two eggs.</p>
  <p>21.11.38 Two eggs.</p>
  <p>22.11.38 Two eggs.</p>
  <p>25.11.38 Two eggs.</p>
  <p>27.11.38 One egg.</p>
  <p>28.11.38 Two eggs.</p>
  <p>Clearly, Orwell's diary would have been the most terrifying book <strong><a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2008/10/see-how-theyve-grown.html" class="external">Alfred Hitchcock</a></strong> could imagine.</p>
  <p>I am also reminded that I once bought a picture postcard in Prague which included a quotation from “The Dairies Of Franz Kafka”.</p>
  <p><strong>EXCITING UPDATE!</strong>&nbsp;: 29.11.38 One egg.</p>
