  <h1 id="post-13109">Thoughts On A Characteristically English August Bank Holiday</h1>
  <p>The rain it raineth in my brain<br />
  And outside too, upon the mud<br />
  I wonder will it ever drain<br />
  Or drown all life in a great flood<br />
  My sons are Japheth, Ham, and Shem<br />
  They've not one brolly between them<br />
  Before nightfall, when it grows dark<br />
  We had better board my ark<br />
  And take the animals two by two<br />
  We'll have ourselves a floating zoo<br />
  Oh look! There is an aerostat<br />
  Hovering o'er Mount Ararat<br />
  Time's out of joint, I got befuddled<br />
  I'm not Noah, I'm Key, empuddled<br />
  The rain it raineth in my brain<br />
  The rain it raineth, come rain or rain</p>
