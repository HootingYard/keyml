  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The poetry is drugged, and as we read [Francis Thompson's] poems through in the order of their publication, we feel the power of the poppy more and more. At last the hand seems to lose its power and the will its control, though in flashes of sheer flame the imagination shows wild and beautiful as ever. His gorgeousness is beyond that of the Orient. The eccentric and arresting words that constantly amaze the ear, bring with them a sense of things occult yet dazzling, as if we were assisting at some mystic rite, in a ritual which demanded language choice and strange.” — John Kelman, <em>Among Famous Books</em></p>
