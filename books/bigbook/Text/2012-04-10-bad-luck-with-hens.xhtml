  <h1 id="post-8885">Bad Luck With Hens</h1>
  <p>Another magnificent snippet from <em>Fish, Flesh And Good Red Herring&nbsp;: A Gallimaufry</em> by Alice Thomas Ellis (2004):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[The vicar's wife] has had bad luck with hens: she lived for a time on Tristan da Cunha and says there are few things more dispiriting than seeing your poultry being blown by the wind out over the Atlantic.</p>
