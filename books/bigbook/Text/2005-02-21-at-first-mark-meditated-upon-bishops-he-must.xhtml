  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“At first Mark meditated upon bishops…[He] must needs fix his contemplation upon a certain Bishop of Bingen who was eaten by rats. Mark could not remember why he was eaten by rats, but he could with dreadful distinctness remember that the prelate escaped to a castle on an island in the middle of the Rhine, and that the rats swam after him and swarmed in by every window until his castle was—ugh!—Mark tried to banish from his mind the picture of the wicked Bishop Hatto and the rats, millions of them, just going to eat him up.” — Compton MacKenzie, <em>The Altar Steps</em></p>
