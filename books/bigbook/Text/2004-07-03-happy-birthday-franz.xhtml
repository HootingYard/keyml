  <h1>Happy Birthday, Franz</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Today is, or would be, Franz Kafka's 121st birthday. Two things worth remembering about Mr K. Although one thinks of him as a haunted, pallid, neurasthenic wreck, he was in fact an enthusiastic oarsman who enjoyed rowing boats. The other thing I find quite arresting is that he was a keen Fletcherist, which made his table manners trying, to say the least. Fletcherism was (is) a system of eating which involves chewing each bite of food until it becomes a watery mass in your mouth before swallowing. This has two effects. First, if you chew a bite of food that long, you will be consuming your meal at a slower rate. Secondly, the reduction of this food to liquid goo means that it will be less difficult to extract the nutrients. I am not sure whether it is true that the recommended number of mastications is thirty-two (one for each tooth). Horace Fletcher (1849-1919) was an American businessman from Lawrence, Massachusetts who expounded his theories in a number of excitingly-titled books, including <em>Fletcherism : What It Is or How I Became Young At Sixty</em>, <em>The New Menticulture</em>, <em>The AB-Z Of Our Own Nutrition</em>, and <em>The New Glutton Or Epicure.</em> He was known to cycle up to two hundred miles a day. Other notable Fletcherists included John D Rockefeller, Upton Sinclair, and Henry James. Incidentally, I read somewhere that Henry James in his final years became deluded and was convinced that he was Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
  <p>Fletcherism ought not be confused with Daltonism, which is the technical term for colour blindness. John Dalton (1766-1844) was a British chemist and physicist, born at Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth in Cumberland. In 1794 he published the first scientific paper on the subject, <em>Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours</em>.</p>
