  <h1 id="post-11286">Zinc Egret</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Yesterday's piece entitled <strong><em><a href="11276_tungsten_grebe.xhtml" class="internal" title="Tungsten Grebe">Tungsten Grebe</a></em></strong> contained an unfortunate error which rendered it incomprehensible. As a consequence, the Hooting Yard Incoming Postage Logistics Silo was bombarded with untold thousands of letters from readers expressing bafflement, befuddlement, or, in some cases, utter indifference.</p>
  <p>I have now taken the opportunity to reread, rereread, and rerereread the text, scan it through a Blötzmannscope, subject it to the Pigwell-Faffington Test, and carry out several other procedures that you need not bother your ungainly little heads about.</p>
  <p>As a result of my labours, which I can assure you were Herculean, I am now able to announce that if you replace the words “tungsten grebe” with “zinc egret”, all becomes clear. Well, if not exactly clear, then let us say less misty.</p>
