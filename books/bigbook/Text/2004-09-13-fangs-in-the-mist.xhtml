  <h1>Fangs in the Mist</h1>
  <p><em>Fangs In The Mist</em>, a true crime book by T B Puddle, is sadly forgotten and out of print. Those of you with nostalgic childhood memories of having mama or papa read it to you as a bedtime story will be delighted to learn that an extract from it appears in the thirteenth and final chapter of <a class="internal" href="2004-06-21-unspeakable-desolation-pouring-down-from-the-stars-contents.xhtml"><em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em></a>, which appears today. An afterword or endnote will be added next Monday.</p>
