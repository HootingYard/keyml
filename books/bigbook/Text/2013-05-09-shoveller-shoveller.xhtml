  <div class="verse">
  <p>“Shoveller, shoveller, what do you shovel?”</p>
  <p>“I'm shovelling the muck outside your hovel.”</p>
  <p>“Shoveller, shoveller, please desist!<br />
  I love my muck, it will be much missed!”</p>
  <p>“Peasant, oh peasant, the muck is not yours.<br />
  I'm shovelling it off for a greater cause.<br />
  The cause of the princeling who owns your muck,<br />
  As he owns you, your hovel and your duck<br />
  And your pot and your pan and your hay and your straw.<br />
  The princeling needs your muck for the war.”</p>
  <p>“Shoveller, shoveller, what war is that?”</p>
  <p>“It is the war of the princeling's hat.”</p>
  </div>
  <p><em>Fragment from an old folk song called “The War Of The Princeling's Hat”.</em></p>
