  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Behold, Teta hath arrived in the height of heaven, and the henmemet beings have seen him; the Semketet boat knoweth him, and it is Teta who saileth it, and the Mantchet boat calleth unto him, and it is Teta who bringeth it to a standstill. Teta hath seen his body in the Semketet boat, he knoweth the uraeus which is in the Mantchet boat, and God hath called him in his name…and hath taken him in to Ra.” — E A Wallis Budge, <em>Egyptian Ideas Of The Future Life</em></p>
