  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The postman came just now, and among the letters he brought was one from North Wales. It was fat and soft and bulgy, and when it was opened we found it contained a bit of seaweed. … “Oh, how it smells of Sheringham,” said one. “No, there is the smack of Sidmouth, and Dawlish, and Torquay in its perfume,” said another.” — Alfred George Gardiner (“Alpha of the Plough”), <em>Pebbles On The Shore</em> (1916)</p>
