  <h1>Plummermania</h1>
  <p>Quetzalcoatl is the feathered serpent, an Aztec deity, as worshipped by Christopher Plummer in his weird performance as Atahualpa in <em>The Royal Hunt of the Sun</em> (1969). In a better world, Plummer would have used the same acting technique (and terrific strangulated high-pitched squawking voice) in his earlier role as Baron Von Trapp in <em>The Sound of Music</em>. Imagining this is always a good way to cheer oneself up.</p>
