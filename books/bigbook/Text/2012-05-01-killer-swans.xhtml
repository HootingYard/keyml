  <h1 id="post-9036">Killer Swans!</h1>
  <p class="noindent">With my ornithologist's hat on, I keep telling you that swans are savage, murderous, semi-aquatic monsters. Now, with thanks to reader Dan Fuchs, <strong><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/18/illinois-man-dies-in-attack-by-swans/" class="external">unassailable evidence</a></strong> that I have been right all along…</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">A man whose job was to maintain and care for the swans at a suburban condominium complex in Des Plaines, Illinois was killed yesterday in what appears to have been a freak attack by one or more of the birds.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">Nothing freakish about it, when, like me, you know what you're dealing with… feathered fiends!</p>
