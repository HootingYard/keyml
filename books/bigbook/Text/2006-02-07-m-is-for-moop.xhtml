  <h1>M Is for Moop</h1>
  <p>And so we reach the half-way mark in our serial story, <em>The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet</em>, which began with <em>A Is For Aminadab</em> on 23 <a class="internal" href="2006-01-01-hooting-yard-archive-january-2006.xhtml">January</a></p>
  <p>Moop's shoes had been shoved into a red plastic basin on the floor underneath her sink. Each tuberologist had their own sink. Doctor Cack had insisted upon it.</p>
