  <p>In 1922, Charles Ives self-published his collection of 114 songs. Now, almost one hundred years later, Mr Key has self-published a collection of 114 stories. Yes, at last, wrenched from the innermost core of his creative innards, <em><strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/impugned-by-a-peasant-other-stories/13042967" class="external">Impugned By A Peasant &amp; Other Stories</a></strong></em> is available for you to buy, to fawn over, to stroke tenderly with your fingertips just like Christopher Plummer as Atahualpa in <em>The Royal Hunt Of The Sun</em>, in dazzling sunlight, strokes the Holy Bible. Or you may prefer to keep your copy locked away in a lead-lined cabinet, submerged in a pit, cordoned off by an electric fence patrolled by wolves and hogs. It's up to you, really. The important thing is that you buy as many copies of the book as a sensible person would, what with Christmas coming up, and all those birthdays and anniversaries and saints' feast days on which you will want to present your nearest and dearest with a treasurable gift. So get with the programme, readers, and hike over to <strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/impugned-by-a-peasant-other-stories/13042967" class="external">Lulu</a></strong> at once to make your purchase!</p>
