  <h1>Rhubarb</h1>
  <p class="noindent">As we know, tiny John Ruskin was allowed to <strong><a href="2009-08-01-further-adventures-of-little-ruskin.xhtml" class="internal" title="Further Adventures Of Little Ruskin">jump off his favourite box</a></strong> on Sunday afternoons. Things were not nearly so idyllic for <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Hare" class="external">Augustus Hare</a></strong>:</p>
  <p>“I remember that one day when we went to visit the curate, a lady very innocently gave me a lollypop, which I ate. This crime was discovered when I came home by the smell of peppermint, and a large dose of rhubarb and soda was at once administered with a forcing-spoon, though I was in robust health at that time, to teach me to avoid such carnal indulgences as lollypops for the future. For two years, also, I was obliged to swallow a dose of rhubarb every morning and every evening because—according to old-fashioned ideas—it was supposed to ‘strengthen the stomach’! I am sure it did me a great deal of harm, and had much to do with accounting for my after sickliness.”</p>
  <p>From <em>The Years With Mother&nbsp;: Being an abridgement of the first three volumes of The Story Of My Life</em> by Augustus J C Hare (1952)</p>
