  <h1>Poetry Corner</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Mention of an “intense mangle” in the Amazon.com review (see below, 16th December) reminded me of a similarly infelicitous phrase I came upon recently. When George W Bush made his state visit to Britain, <em>The Guardian</em> invited the usual suspects to write open letters to him for a special edition of the <em>G2</em> supplement. The so-called “Poet Laureate” Andrew Motion contributed a poem, the first stanza of which is:</p>
  <p class="verse">
  The child who has lost his arms<br/>
  thought he was catching a ball<br/>
  when the bomb his enemies dropped<br/>
  bounced through his dapper hall.</p>
  <p class="noindent">This titanic piece of versifying repays considerable attention. Just one point to ponder—in the fourth line, why is the boy's hall “dapper”? Is he in the <em>hall</em> because it rhymes with <em>ball</em>? Have you ever visited someone's house and, looking around admiringly, announced, “My, isn't this dapper?” No, you have not. Nor has anyone else. Ever.</p>
