  <h1>Downy, Witched, Dutch Cloud-heaps of Some Quaintest Tramontane Nephelococcugia of Thought</h1>
  <p class="noindent">This familiar phrase, which appears in the quotation from M. P. Shiel above, was also the title of one of Dobson's more readable works, and the only one to find a publisher in his lifetime. (All those pamphlets of his were, of course, cranked out on Marigold Chew's dilapidated printing press.) During the early 1950s, after spending some time as a pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard instructor at the Pang Hill Orphanage, Dobson became interested for the first time in writing pedagogic works for urchins. The early attempts were not a success. In a burst of ludicrous enthusiasm, he produced a series of ten “Tracts For Tinies” (including the now justly-admired <em>Hideous Execution Practices Of The Blood-Drenched Corsairs</em>, <em>Ten Easy Steps To Grooming Your Cormorant</em>, and <em>My Nightmares About Emily Dickinson</em>), but sales were few, and most of the copies ended up being used as hot air balloon ballast. Late in 1958, however, a janitor who worked for Ladybird Books picked up a copy of <em>A Brief &amp; Bewildering History Of Helsinki</em> in a charity shop, read it with glee, and showed it to one of the firm's editors, who immediately tracked down the elusive pamphleteer. Commissioned to write a book for the Junior Science series, and given <em>carte blanche</em> regarding his subject-matter, Dobson scribbled down this tremendous text in just three hours. Sadly, it is now out of print.</p>
