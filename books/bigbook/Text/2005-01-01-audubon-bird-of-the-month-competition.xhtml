  <h1>Audubon Bird-of-the-month Competition</h1>
  <p>Winner of the December Audubon Bird-of-the-Month Competition (see foot of the page) was reader Pierre Sloggit, whose entry reads as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I know what this bird is, it's a Taft's Guillemot. It is shown in your picture guarding the famous oyster that was thought by many to incorporate in the convolutions of its shell an image of Howard Taft, one time US President. [Pierre is, I think, using here an outmoded term for “Potus”.] This bird was only discovered in the early twentieth century and was therefore added to a supplement of Audubon's work.<span class="asterisk">*</span> It should be distinguished from Barbara's Guillemot, which of course stands guard over the head of former First Lady, Barbara Bush, who by remarkable coincidence has a facial birthmark that looks like an oyster, as well as a moustache like Howard Taft.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="footnote"><span class="mark">*</span><em>Missing Guillemots and Auks: Series IX (Presidential Guillemots): Supplementary vols. CCCXI – CCCXXVIII (Great Lakes and Seaway Guillemots, Three Toed and Lesser).</em></p>
  <p>Pierre wins a hallucinatory bowl of myrrh and some trinkets.</p>
