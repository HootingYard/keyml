  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“We turned back through the city, and walked along watching the zopilotes with their bald heads and foul dingy-black plumage. They were sitting in compact rows on parapets of houses and churches, and seemed specially to affect the cross of the cathedral, where they perched, two on each arm, and some on the top. When some offal was thrown into the streets, they came down leisurely upon it, one after another; their appearance and deportment reminding us of the undertaker's men in England coming down from the hearse at the public-house door, when the funeral is over.” — Edward Burnett Tylor, <em>Anahuac</em></p>
