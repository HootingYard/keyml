  <p>Yesterday's episode of <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-14th-december-2017/" class="external"><strong><em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em></strong></a> was the final show for the Year of Our Lord MMXVII. As a special treat for listeners' ears, it included a rather marvellous rendition of <a href="2017-11-02-the-cuthbert-spraingue-song.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Cuthbert Spraingue Song"><strong>The Cuthbert Spraingue Song,</strong></a> for which Mr Key was joined by the dulcet tones of Pansy Cradledew. Thereafter, there was a lot of babble about an <a href="2017-11-04-ogre.xhtml" class="internal" title="Ogre"><strong>ogre</strong></a>, and Dobson, both <a href="2017-11-05-dobson-on-an-atoll.xhtml" class="internal" title="Dobson On An Atoll"><strong>on an atoll</strong></a> and <a href="2017-11-06-dobson-in-a-pickle.xhtml" class="internal" title="Dobson In A Pickle"><strong>in a pickle</strong></a>. Plus an end note on Italian fascist Benito Mussolini.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, don't forget that ancient episodes of the show are being regularly added to an archive on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWRkgZ7yMk_MqGzFco1sEA" class="external"><strong>YouTube</strong></a>.</p>
