  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“She had no way of knowing how long she sat there before the tapping on her window brought her to her feet with a start. Stark fear squeezed the breath from her body and made her incapable of motion. Suddenly a face appeared at the window! A strange face, yet hauntingly familiar. In a flash she recognized it to be that of Phyllis, the trapeze artist, but in some way it was different! Haltingly, she made her way to the window and threw back the catch. Into the room bounded the half nude figure of a man!” — Hugh J Gallagher, <em>Death Mates For The Lust-Lost</em></p>
