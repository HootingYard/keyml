  <h1 id="post-3999">In Parenthesis</h1>
  <p class="noindent">The greatest parenthesis in literature has already been written, and will never be improved upon. It is from <em>Lolita</em>, where Nabokov writes: “My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three.”</p>
  <p>But one must always be on the lookout for superb phrases, or complete sentences, in parentheses, and there is a fine example in today's <em>Guardian</em>. Into her <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/27/woman-shot-mussolini-stonor-saunders" class="external">review</a></strong> of <em>The Woman Who Shot Mussolini</em> by Frances Stonor Saunders, Lucy Hughes-Hallett drops this marvel: “(Rumour had it he kept a tortoise in his sporran.)”</p>
  <p>(One day I must set to work on an anthology of great parentheses.)</p>
