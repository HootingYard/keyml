  <p class="noindent">Adam Faith's famous last words, spoken in a Stoke-on-Trent hotel room, were apparently “Channel Five is shit, isn't it?” I am not qualified to judge whether the dead popster was right or wrong, but there is at least one programme on the channel today which deserves our attention.</p>
