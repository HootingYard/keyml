  <h1>Animals on Television</h1>
  <p class="noindent">We try to keep abreast of the latest news in the world o' television, and have just learned that the BBC's popular countryside programme <em>One Man And His Dog</em>, in which shepherds and sheepdogs display their skills, is to be axed. Our sources tell us that it will be replaced in the new year by <em>One Man And His Swarm Of Killer Bees</em>, presented by V S Naipaul and Liza Minnelli.</p>
