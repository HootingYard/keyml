  <p>“Ministers of religion have always been attached to their orchards. Ever since the Serpent induced Eve to eat of a particular apple and Eve tempted Adam to do the same, the livelihood of the clergy has depended upon a proper appreciation of fruit.”</p>
  <p>Hesketh Pearson, in his potted biography of the Reverend Samuel Ogden, “Boswell's Bedside Author”, in <em>Extraordinary People</em> (1965)</p>
