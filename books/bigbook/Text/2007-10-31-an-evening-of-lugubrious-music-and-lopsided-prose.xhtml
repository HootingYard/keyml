  <h1 id="post-274">An Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It's not often that the command “Drop what you're doing and go to Slough!” is irresistible. This is one of those times. Or rather, next week, Friday 9<sup>th</sup> November is one of those times, for on that day you should drop what you're doing and go to Slough for <em>An Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose</em>. David OutaSpaceman will provide the lugubrious music, and I shall be declaiming lopsided prose from the Hooting Yard archive. You can find details, including a handy map, <a href="http://fenner.ddict.co.uk/" class="external">here</a>, if you scroll down the page a bit.</p>
  <p><strong>Addendum</strong>&nbsp;: Ten thrilling photographs from the evening can be found <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/FennerFest/2007_11_09_HootingYard" class="external">here</a>.</p>
