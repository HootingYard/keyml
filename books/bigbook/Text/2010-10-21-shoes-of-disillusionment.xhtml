  <h1 id="post-5443">Shoes Of Disillusionment</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Reader Mark Patterson alerts me to the usefulness of the robe in modern Druidic practice—with an important caveat.</p>
  <p>In <em>The Living Stones</em> (1957), Ithell Colquhoun wrote&nbsp;: “It disguises imperfections of figure: round shoulders, bosoms of unmodish size or shape, pigeon-chests, pot-bellies, too-insistent buttocks, knock knees and bandy legs, all are mitigated in the merciful folds of the robe. But whatever the type of robe… its effect is often destroyed by disillusioning shoes.”</p>
