  <h1 id="post-11109">You Can Buy God</h1>
  <p class="noindent">In the song “Joe The Lion” on his <em>‘Heroes'</em> album, David Bowie tells us that “You can buy God”. I had always thought he was spouting twaddle, and pernicious twaddle at that, until I saw, in a New York shop window, the baby Jesus for sale, with a price tag tied to his elbow. Alas, the shop was shut, and I was unable to make purchase.</p>
