  <h1 id="post-2501">The University Of Life, On A Canal</h1>
  <p>“Then next, take <em>canal</em> life as a form of ‘university’ education. Your present system of education is to get a rascal of an architect to order a rascal of a clerk-of-the-works to order a parcel of rascally bricklayers to build you a bestially stupid building in the middle of the town, poisoned with gas, and with an iron floor which will drop you all through it some frosty evening; wherein you will bring a puppet of a cockney lecturer in a dress coat and a white tie, to tell you smugly there's no God, and how many messes he can make of a lump of sugar. Much the better you are for all that, when you get home again, aren't you?”</p>
  <p>John Ruskin, <em>Fors Clavigera</em>, Letter LXXV “Star Law” (1877)</p>
