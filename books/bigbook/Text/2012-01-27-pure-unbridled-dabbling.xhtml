  <p>I hesitate to provide this <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2012/01/pure-unbridled-filth/" class="external">link</a></strong> to my cupboard in <em>The Dabbler</em> on this fine Friday, for this week I have chosen to besmirch the pages of that splendid blog with a stream of pure unbridled filth. Those of you who, in spite of that warning, proceed to wallow in a swamp of moral turpitude may be amused to discover that, in the Comments, a fellow named George has devised a diverting parlour game which will provide much fun and frolic to those who commandeer their parlours for the playing of games.</p>
