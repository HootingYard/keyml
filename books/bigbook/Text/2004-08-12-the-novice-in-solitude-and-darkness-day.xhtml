  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The novice, in solitude and darkness, day after day and night after night, ponders images of perdition and despair. He is taught to hear, in imagination, the howlings of the damned, to see their convulsive agonies, to feel the flames that burn without consuming, to smell the corruption of the tomb and the fumes of the infernal pit. He must picture to himself an array of adverse armies, one commanded by Satan on the plains of Babylon, one encamped under Christ about the walls of Jerusalem; and the perturbed mind, humbled by long contemplation of its own vileness, is ordered to enroll itself under one or the other banner.” — Francis Parkman, <em>The Jesuits In North America In The Seventeenth Century</em></p>
