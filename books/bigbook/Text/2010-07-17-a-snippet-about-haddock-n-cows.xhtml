  <h1 id="post-4785">A Snippet About Haddock &amp; Cows</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The haddock… amongst marine animals, is supposed, throughout maritime Europe, to be a privileged fish&nbsp;: even in austere Scotland every child can point out the impression of St Peter's thumb, by which, from age to age, it is distinguished from fishes having, otherwise, an external resemblance. All domesticated cattle, having the benefit of man's guardianship and care, are believed, throughout England and Germany, to go down upon their knees at one particular moment on Christmas Eve, when the fields are covered in darkness, when no eye looks down but that of God, and when the exact anniversary hour revolves of the angelic song, once rolling over the fields and flocks of Palestine.”</p>
  <p>Hargrave Jennings, <em>Curious Things Of The Outside World, Last Fire</em> (1861)</p>
