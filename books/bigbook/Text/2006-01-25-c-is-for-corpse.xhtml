  <h1>C Is for Corpse</h1>
  <p>Episode three in our daily serialisation of <em>The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet</em></p>
  <p>Oh dear! Hidden behind an iron chest in the pointless hut, bundled up in sacking, there is a dead body. The cause of death is not immediately apparent. In a few weeks time, an inquest will be told that the oesophagus contains three or four small items of ironmongery. The sacking is mostly burlap.</p>
