  <p><strong><a href="http://nigeness.blogspot.com/2010/07/vets-daughter.html" class="external">Nige</a></strong> has a postage about Barbara Comyns, which served to remind me that <em>Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead</em> (1954) is one of my favourite novels, and without any doubt the finest book in the popular outbreak-of-ergot-poisoning genre. I have not reread it for years, so have removed it from the shelves in readiness.</p>
  <p>Those who like to delve into such things may wish to know that I consider it an important influence on my own scribblings. How could it not be, when, leafing through it just now I note sentences such as:</p>
  <p><em>There was a great smell of mud, and it was the first of June.</em></p>
  <p><em>We always have cocoa after a thunderstorm.</em></p>
  <p><em>The village bachelor, drink-sodden Lumber Splinterbones, usually ambled along to Grandmother Willoweed's birthday party.</em></p>
  <p><em>Dennis was frightened of cows</em></p>
  <p>and there should now be a question mark to end <em>this</em> sentence on a grammatically sound footing, thusâ€¦ ?</p>
