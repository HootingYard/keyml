  <p>The time has come for me to update the enormously useful Hooting Yard <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2010/09/keys-cupboard-pontiff-mnemonic/" class="external">Pontiff Mnemonic</a></strong>. Before I wrestle with the most appropriate F word, however, I think I am right in saying that there could be no more Hooting Yardy Pontiff than a one-lunged Jesuit bus passenger.</p>

  <p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> I managed to pluck from the dictionary the definitive F word to add to the Pontiff Mnemonic just in time for today's episode of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> on ResonanceFM. You can find out what the word is by listening to the show, archived on soundcloud <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/resonance-fm/18-30-00-hooting-yard-on-the-7" class="external">here</a></strong>.</p>
