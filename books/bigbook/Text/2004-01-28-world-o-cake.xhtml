  <h1>World O' Cake</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Following the item about the sop to Cerberus (see below, January 24th January), reader Ruth Pastry has written as follows: “It is all very well including such nuggets of (questionable) information, but if you are going to whet the readers' appetite in such a manner, please do not stint<span class="asterisk">*</span> when it comes to giving us the full story. I am sure I am not alone in wanting to know what kind of cake is referred to. Chocolate swiss roll? Battenburg? Old Mother Framley's Cherry Surprise?”</p>
  <p>Point taken, Dr Pastry. If any readers can help out, I will be happy to publish contributions to this invigorating debate.</p>
  <p class="footnote"><span class="mark">*NOTE&nbsp;:</span> A <a class="external" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/guide/l/littlestint/index.asp">stint</a> is, of course, a bird. What is Dr Pastry prattling on about?</p>
