  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Their strong Holds have all the open Places cover'd with Canvass stretch'd from Side to Side; upon which is strew'd an Herb so venemous, that, in six Hours after it has been expos'd to the Sun, it emits so pestiferous a Stench, that no Fowl can approach it by many Yards, but what will fall dead; and this Stench, by the Effluvia mounting, is no way offensive to those below.” — Captain Samuel Brunt, <em>A Voyage To Cacklogallinia, With A Description Of The Religion, Policy, Customs And Manners of That Country</em></p>
