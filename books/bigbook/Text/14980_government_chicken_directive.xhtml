  <h1 id="post-14980">Government Chicken Directive</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I learn from the BBC that chickens are to be kept indoors to create a Bird-Flu-Free-Zone. This prompts a little song we can all sing as we round up our chickens (if we have any):</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Bring in your chickens!<br />
  It's Indoor Poultry Week.<br />
  Pop your chicken on the couch<br />
  And pat its little beak.</p>
  <p>Apparently we should also be on the lookout for dead or debilitated swans, and report any sightings to the police.</p>
