  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Cheese was rarely consumed on an allegorical level in the seventeenth century.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">E. de Jongh, cited in <em>The Embarrassment Of Riches&nbsp;: An Interpretation Of Dutch Culture In The Golden Age</em> (1987) by Simon Schama. Lucky for me that I did not live in that place at that time, as my own consumption of cheese is pursued almost exclusively on an allegorical level. I shall have more to say on this matter shortly.</p>
