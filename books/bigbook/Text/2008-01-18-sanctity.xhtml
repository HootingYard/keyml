  <h1 id="post-354">Sanctity</h1>
  <p class="noindent"><a href="http://outaspaceman.blogspot.com/" class="external"><strong>OutaSpaceman</strong></a> dropped me a line to point out that I failed to observe the feast day of St Mungo last Monday, 14th January. Remiss of me, I know. To make up for such an inexplicable oversight, let me draw your attention to St Prisca, whose feast day is today.</p>

  <p>St Prisca was a child martyr, and you can read all about her in <a href="http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=brown&amp;book=saints&amp;story=prisca" class="external"><strong><em>The Book Of Saints And Friendly Beasts</em></strong></a> by Abbie Farwell Brown. You will learn how, “Small and defenceless though she was, she did not fear to tell everyone what she believed and Whose Cross she followed. So she soon became known as a firm little Christian maiden.” When you have read this stirring tale, and wept, yet felt strangely uplifted, I recommend some of the other stories you will find there, such as Saint Keneth [sic] Of The Gulls, Saint Launomar's Cow, Saint Fronto's Camels, and Saint Werburgh And Her Goose. That should be quite enough saints to keep you occupied and out of mischief.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> It strikes me that St Prisca comes across as a Christian version of heroic infant <a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/?cat=25" class="hootingyard"><strong>Tiny Enid</strong></a>, many of whose exploits have been recorded here. I am not aware to what, if any, religious persuasion Tiny Enid adhered, but I shall do some research and let readers know in due course.</p>
