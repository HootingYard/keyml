  <h1 id="post-15098">O, Little Radish</h1>
  <p>By popular demand, here is another verse by a <a href="2016-12-29-sulky-bulgarian-poets.xhtml" class="internal" title="Sulky Bulgarian Poets"><strong>sulky Bulgarian poet</strong>,</a> written circa 1982. This one is entitled <em>O, Little Radish</em> and purports to be by Fratsin K Yecebit. (My poets' names sound Turkish rather than Bulgarian, but I was young, so young â€¦)</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Tomorrow morning we will<br />
  Drink vinegar<br />
  Here in this trench.<br />
  I haven't paid<br />
  Any of my debts<br />
  And I don't intend to.<br />
  They can brandish guns at me<br />
  Or twigs.<br />
  I'll make my peace<br />
  And whip it up with a whisk.<br />
  Send me your cash now.<br />
  Send me the lot.<br />
  I'm the man you ought to<br />
  Shove in the vat.</p>
