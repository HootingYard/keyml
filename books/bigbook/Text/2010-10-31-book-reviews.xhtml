  <p>Another snippet from Richard O'Connor's 1967 biography of Ambrose Bierce:</p>
  <p>“The book-reviewing end of his chores, predictably, loosed [Bierce's] most savage energies… He once composed what may be the shortest, nastiest book review on the record by listing its title, author and publisher and adding the one-line comment, ‘The covers of this book are too far apart’.</p>
  <p>“Occasionally, like an eagle swooping down on the carrion-littered plains of literature, he would quote one paragraph of a current novel as an example of hopelessly bad writing. Such as&nbsp;: ‘She remained inactive in his embrace for a considerable period, then modestly disengaging herself looked him full in the countenance and signified a desire for self-communion. By love's instinct he divined her purpose—she wanted to consider his proposal apart from the influence of the glamour of his personal presence. With the innate tact of a truly genteel nature he bade her good evening in French, and with measured tread paced away into the gathering gloom’.”</p>
  <p>Alas, we are not told the titles of the two books under review.</p>
