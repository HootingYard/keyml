  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Having first tested the air and proved it good by dropping in blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine, a stout oak stick was attached to the end of the rope… The sensation was strange and exhilarating. Looking up I could only see the small opening I came through, and a straggling stream of light poured down that, but on all sides profound darkness reigned supreme.” — Luella Agnes Owen, <em>Cave Regions Of the Ozarks And Black Hills</em></p>
