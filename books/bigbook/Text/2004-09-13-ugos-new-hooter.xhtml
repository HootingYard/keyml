  <h1>Ugo's New Hooter</h1>
  <p>Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his blind ma's ear. “Ooh, Ugo,” said Ugo's ma, “That hooter makes a din!” “It's a hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize,” said Ugo. “And what did your pal Ulf win, Ugo?” asked Ugo's ma, shelling peas as she spoke. “Ulf won a toy wolf, ma,” said Ugo, “It's as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars.” Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.</p>
