  <h1 id="post-7877">A Lopsided And Lugubrious Christmas</h1>
  <p class="noindent">On Thursday next, 22nd December at 6.00 PM, <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/" class="external">ResonanceFM</a></strong> will be broadcasting the Hooting Yard Christmas Specialâ€”an hour-long (slightly edited) recording of last month's <strong><a href="http://www.woolfsonandtay.com/1/post/2011/11/frank-key-and-outa_spaceman-18-nov-2011.html" class="external">Evening Of Lopsided Prose And Lugubrious Music</a></strong> at Woolfson &amp; Tay in Bermondsey Square. Those of you who were there will be able to relive those golden moments, and those who were unable to attend can hear what you missed, and gnash your teeth, and rend your garments in despair, after which you may want to cheer yourselves up a little by sending Mr Key his Christmas money, via <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=YnPjDtJCPl0ciyvr-eeG9HbJrpOp7aGF_3qdwEo1GMN_5EqPTQuCF6GJs_S&amp;dispatch=50a222a57771920b6a3d7b606239e4d529b525e0b7e69bf0224adecfb0124e9b61f737ba21b081988562bf19d61623c6f33db8e87506be10" class="external">PayPal</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>A podcast of the complete, unedited recording will be available shortly after the broadcast, and I will of course post a link to it here.</p>
