  <p class="noindent">You lot are aware, I think, that Hooting Yard is a with-it, groovy, space age kinda place. If proof were needed (which it isn't) then what could be more with-it and groovy and space age than the release of Mr Key's recent paperback <em>Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle!</em> in the decisively intangible form of an ebook for Kindle?</p>
