  <h1>Download News</h1>
  <p>Downloading music from the internet is now so popular that the music industry has established a chart of (legal) downloads alongside its usual album and single charts. What has gone unnoticed is the concurrent staggering growth in downloads of John James Audubon's magnificent <em>Birds Of America</em> paintings. Just as music lovers use file-sharing programmes such as Kazaa or WinMX, Audubonistas favour a dedicated piece of software called DownloadAudubonBirdsOfAmericaPictureFilesV1. 04. What is not often realised is that one can access the paintings via any old internet connection, for example by visiting <a class="external" href="http://www.abirdshome.com/Audubon/plates.html">A Bird's Home</a>. To whet the appetites of any readers who have not yet become caught up in the craze, here is this week's chart of the top five downloads (last week's position in brackets).</p>
  <p>1. Little Columbian Owl (4)</p>
  <p>2. The Wood Pewee (2)</p>
  <p>3. Townshend's Ptilogonys (18)</p>
  <p>4. The Worm-Eating Swamp Warbler (9)</p>
  <p>5. The Cow-pen-bird (1)</p>
