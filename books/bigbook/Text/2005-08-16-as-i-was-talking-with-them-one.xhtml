  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“As I was talking with them one of their camels belched, and the donkey took fright and ran off, and the gods fell off its back, and three of them were broken, and only two remained whole. But when the Syrians saw what had happened, they said, ‘Why did you not tell us that you had gods to sell? We might have bought them before the donkey took fright, and they would not have been destroyed; at least we will take the gods that remain, and pay you the price of them all’. And they did so; and the broken gods I cast into the river Gur, and they sank and were seen no more.” — M R James, <em>Old Testament Legends</em></p>
