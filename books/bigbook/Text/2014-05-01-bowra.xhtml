  <h1 id="post-12701">Bowra</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Last night I dreamed of Sir Maurice Bowra (1898—1971). When I awoke, this morning, I had to <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Bowra" class="external">look him up</a></strong> to find out who he was. When I went to sleep last night, his was a name I knew, that I had come across here and there over the years, but I could not have said I knew anything about him.</p>
  <p>I learn, today, among other things, that he wrote&nbsp;: “I expect to pass through this world but once and therefore if there is anybody that I want to kick in the crutch I had better kick them in the crutch now, for I do not expect to pass this way again.”</p>
  <p>In my dream Bowra was hanging about on the street wit a man named Henderson and a third party whose name was not divulged. Bowra had lank sandy hair and looked not unlike the actor David Warner. But in <strong><a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5404" class="external">reality</a></strong>, he was “built like a sandbag, … short and square with no neck and possessed a huge bittern booming voice”. This is what he really looked like.</p>
