  <h1>Terror &amp; Shrubbery</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I have just started reading a collection of stories by Marcel Schwob (translated by Iain White) and was pleasantly startled by the opening sentence of “Train 081”:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">The great terror of my life seems far distant from the shrubbery in which I am writing.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">Marcel Schwob (1867–1905) was a friend of Alfred Jarry, and the dedicatee of <em>Ubu Roi</em>. I may have more to say as I read the book, <em>The King In The Golden Mask &amp; Other Writings</em> (1982).</p>
