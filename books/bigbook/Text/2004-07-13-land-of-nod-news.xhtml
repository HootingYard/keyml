  <h1>Land of Nod News</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Why,” writes Tim Thurn, “did you choose to illustrate chapter four of <em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em> [see yesterday, below] with a photograph of Emily Dickinson's gravestone? I cannot see the relevance.” Well, Tim, therein lies a story. For many years I have been plagued by nightmares about the Belle of Amherst. Sometimes she comes wafting towards me hovering in the air, surrounded by malignant hens or similar poultry. Sometimes I dream that I am sitting in a shaded bower, scented by honeysuckle and lilac, idly reading some imaginary pamphlet of Dobson's, when with terrifying suddenness a wraith-like Emily Dickinson appears before me, wailing, flailing a cutlass or scimitar at my head, a ghastly rictus distorting her face. At other times I have woken with Lovecraftian shudders, trying to expel horrible nightmare-visions of Emily Dickinson sat in the crows'-nest of a pirate ship, a necklace of teeth and bones around her white neck, dropping cake-crumbs on to the heads of the sailors below. So, Tim, every now and then I find that by contemplation of the poet's tombstone, with that irrevocable <em>Called Back May 15th 1886</em>, I can remind myself that she is indeed dead and gone, and so, for a few nights at least, my sleep will be untroubled by her restless spirit.</p>
  <p>On a related note, readers may be interested to know that this morning I awoke from a vivid dream in which Pansy Cradledew got married to Anthony Newley (1931-1999), the actor, writer and musician (and influence on the young, <em>Laughing Gnome</em>-era David Bowie). Pansy hastens to assure me that this is not the case, citing that, like Emily Dickinson, the ex-husband of Joan Collins has also been “called back”. However, the alacrity with which she provided the picture below, a publicity shot for Mr Newley's 1969 film <em>Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe And Find True Happiness?</em>, gives one pause for thought.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The heading for this item, by the way, uses the <em>Land of Nod</em> in its now common sense as a euphemism for sleep. Lest we forget, Nod was the land to which Cain was banished after he slew his brother Abel. <em>And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden</em> (Genesis 4:16). One of Dobson's earliest pamphlets was a gazetteer of Nod, excerpts from which we hope to publish soon.</p>
