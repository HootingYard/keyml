  <p>This week in <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/09/heroes-in-the-seaweed/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I pioneer a new form of close textual analysis of classic songs, starting with “Suzanne” by Leonard Cohen. And when I say “close”, I mean close—in my attempt to winkle out the deep meaning of the song I concentrate on a single six-word phrase, jettisoning the rest of it. And when I say “winkle”, well, as you will discover when you pore over my piece, winkles and other hardy organic life-forms of the tide pool have a crucial part to play in the heretofore hidden deep structure of the song.</p>
  <p>One unexpected advantage of my brain-numbing work was the realisation that there is a connection, albeit tentative and tangential, with my concurrent <strong><a href="2011-09-06-lobster-research.xhtml" class="internal" title="Lobster Research">lobster research</a></strong>. I make no great claims for what we might call “the Suzanne lobster”, but it suffices, I think, that the word “lobsters” appears, not at all gratuitously, in my analysis.</p>
  <p>These are hideously complicated matters, but I hope I have been able to shed some little light on them.</p>
