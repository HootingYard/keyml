  <h1>Agatha Christie's Mystery Potatoes!</h1>
  <p>I mentioned <strong><a href="2012-05-24-like-flies-to-a-cucumber.xhtml" class="internal" title="Like Flies To A Cucumber">yesterday</a></strong> Jack Warner's fantastic cheese-and-biscuits recipe, included in <em>The Curious Cookbook</em> by Peter Ross. The original source is a wartime collection entitled <em>A Kitchen Goes To War&nbsp;: Famous People Contribute 150 Recipes To A Ration-Time Cookery Book</em> (1940). Among the other dishes is the splendidly-named Agatha Christie's Mystery Potatoes. I was intending to transcribe the recipe here, then realised that in so doing I would shatter the mystery, so instead I will urge—or indeed egg you on—to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Curious-Cookbook-Sparrows-Historic/dp/0712358633" class="external">buy the book</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, you might be interested in making imitation bacon out of marzipan. Who wouldn't be?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Take some of your marchpane [<em>marzipan</em>] Paste, and work it in red saunders [<em>sandalwood—a red dye</em>] till it be red; then rowl a broad sheet of white paste, and a sheet of red paste; three of the white and four of the red, and so one upon the other in mingled sorts, every red between, then cut it overthwart, till it look like collops [<em>slices</em>] of bacon, then dry it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That is from <em>A Queen's Delight</em> of 1671, and given the title I suggest you make some to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee.</p>
