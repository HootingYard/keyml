  <h1>The Hooting Yard Biennale</h1>
  <p>Summertime is of course the time for arts festivals, and here at Hooting Yard, the famous Biennale rivals Venice for what Mrs Gubbins has called “cultural clout”. Highlights include:</p>
  <p>A one-man show by Tad Wensleydale, in which the great child Method actor will essay a number of parts, including Agamemnon, Thomas a Becket, both Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge, Christopher Columbus, Christopher Plummer, Clive Bunker, the one-time drummer with Jethro Tull, late lamented astronomer Carl Sagan and French author Françoise Sagan (in an excerpt from Beerpint's classic <em>A Tale Of Two Sagans</em>), Yoko Ono, Ayn Rand and a ferocious giant invisible hamster.</p>
  <p>The first showing in two decades of Globb's triptych <em>The Shroud Of Hengist</em>.</p>
  <p>Enrico Fubby &amp; His Performing Tea-Strainers.</p>
  <p>Morris dancing, balaclava wearing, pond draining, skipping, gamboling, frolicking, mucking about, and pointing warily at birds.</p>
  <p>Rufus Hinge reads from his classic <em>A Little Book Of Bus Tickets.</em></p>
  <p>All of these events, and more, taking place during Rainfall Awareness Week.</p>
  <p>Please note that, as its name indicates, the Hooting Yard Biennale takes place every two years, and this is the other year, apparently.</p>
