  <h1>International Bog Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">According to the superb <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a>, tomorrow is International Bog Day, a time for all of us to sing the praises of sphagnum. I am distraught to note that for once the wiki is wrong, as the celebration came five days early this year. However, one sure way to recover from such a trauma is to ponder all the other special days or weeks that are celebrated around the world. I am particularly fond of “Awareness Weeks”, those times when we are urged to raise our consciousness about—usually—health-related matters. But why should nosebleeds, coughing fits, running sores and botched trepanning operations get all the attention? It's time to broaden the range. I therefore propose that next week should become Potato Awareness Week, with Wednesday as International Pencil Sharpener Day. Before introducing an exciting new calendar, however, I ought to check up on what already exists. I am sure there must be a website somewhere giving comprehensive details of all these things, but I haven't found it. If any reader can help, please send details of useful links.</p>
