  <h1>Pastry Post</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Dr Ruth Pastry has written in yet again: “Yesterday you showed a picture of Dr Henry Kissinger in close proximity to a picture of a leech. Is this meant to be amusing?” Dr Pastry should be aware that, unlike her, Kissinger has never been entitled to that “Dr”: he simply made it up, trusting—for the most part correctly—that no one would dare challenge it, given his assumed gravitas and that sepulchral voice which outdoes even the graveyard tones of our own dear brain guru Tony Buzan. Anyway, Kissinger and the leech appeared in separate items. Get a grip, Dr Pastry!</p>
