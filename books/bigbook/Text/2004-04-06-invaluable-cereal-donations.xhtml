  <h1>Invaluable Cereal Donations</h1>
  <p class="noindent">A masked brigand equipped with a brace of pistols and an incredibly sharp cutlass popped into the office this morning, bearing a message from Mrs Gubbins. Although there is some gruel left in her hideaway, the slops and pap have been exhausted, and our fugitive is wondering whether any readers could send her some cereals. “She says,” growled the brigand, as he manicured his surprisingly elegant fingernails with the cutlass, “She wants bran, durra, millet, sorghum, emmer, spelt, panic, barley, groats, and a lot more millet”. Gentle reader, see what you can do.</p>
