  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The vicious habit of giving birds bad names is one that grows, and you never know when the scientific have come to a finality. For instance, little Robin Red-Breast has successively lived through three tags, <em>Turdus migratorius</em>, <em>Planesticus migratorius</em>, and <em>Turdus canadensis</em>. If he had not been an especially plucky little beggar he would have died under the libels long ago. For my own part I cannot conceive how a man with good red blood in his veins could look a chirky little robin in the eye and call him to his face a <em>Planesticus migratorius</em>, when as chubby youngster he had known the bird and loved him as Robin Red-Breast. One is inclined to ask with suspicion, ‘Is naming a lost art?’” — Agnes Deans Cameron, <em>The New North&nbsp;: Being Some Account Of A Woman's Journey Through Canada To The Arctic</em></p>
