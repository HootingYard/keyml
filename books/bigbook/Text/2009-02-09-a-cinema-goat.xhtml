  <h1 id="post-1735">A Cinema Goat</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Today, for reasons I shall not bore you with, my attention is drawn to the 2005 Hungarian film <em><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466370/" class="external">Fekete kefe</a></strong></em>, directed by Roland Vranik. This synopsis could scarcely fail to entice any devoted Hooting Yardist:</p>
  <p><em>Four fake chimney sweeps prowl on rooftops, in pubs &amp; flats of</em> <em>Budapest</em> <em>and in the stomach of a goat. Love, history, friendship and religion pull each other's weights but in the end there is absolutely no solution. Zoli, DÃ¶fi, Papi and Anti goes to the rooftops one morning to sweep the chimneys but they are meeting a strange housing-estate-goat so they are getting totally confused and everything goes chaos. After their hard day they find the key to escape in the stomach of the goat…</em></p>
  <p>It's shot in black &amp; white, too. I may have to write about a quartet of fake chimney sweeps and a “strange housing estate goat”, and should probably do so before seeing what I have already convinced myself is a masterwork of cinema.</p>
