  <h1>Living With Alf</h1>
  <p>A new property development has recently appeared near where I live. It's a block of flats called Marnie Court, so I suspect all the residents will be deranged blonde kleptomaniacs who try to suppress memories of having murdered a sailor when they were tiny tots.</p>
  <p>I do like the idea of naming blocks of flats after Hitchcock films. Wouldn't you love to live in Psycho House, Rich And Strange Villas, Spellbound Court, Notorious Buildings, Torn Curtain Court, or Frenzy Flats?</p>
