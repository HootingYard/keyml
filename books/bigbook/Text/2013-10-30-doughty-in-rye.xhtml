  <h1>Doughty In Rye</h1>
  <p>Over at the indispensable <strong><a href="http://nigeness.blogspot.co.uk/" class="external">Nigeness</a></strong>, Nige occasionally writes a postage about a fortuitous find in a secondhand bookshop. I thought I would follow his example, for yesterday I was in Rye, and in a tiny bookshop called the Tiny Bookshop I was happy to come upon a 1956 Penguin copy of <em>Passages From Arabia Deserta</em> by Charles Montagu Doughty, for a mere three pounds.</p>

  <p>This is an abridged version of Doughty's best-known work, <em>Travels In Arabia Deserta</em>, which was extolled by <em>The Observer</em> thus: “Charles Montagu Doughty was one of the great men of our day, the author of a unique prose masterpiece. For many readers it is a book so majestic, so vital, of such incomparable beauty of thought, of observation, and of diction as to occupy a place apart among their most cherished literary possessions”.</p>
  <p>I have written about <strong><a href="2009-07-13-gurgles-from-hid-grot.xhtml" class="internal" title="Gurgles From Hid Grot">Doughty</a></strong> before, with particular reference to his strangely hypnotic prose. Never having had the courage to tackle the <em>Travels</em> in their vast entirety, I shall look forward to reading this abridgement—still over 300 pages.</p>
