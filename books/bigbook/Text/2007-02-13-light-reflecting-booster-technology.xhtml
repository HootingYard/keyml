  <h1 id="post-47">Light Reflecting Booster Technology</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It is with some trepidation that I announce an imminent court case. For a long time I turned a blind eye to the continued boasts of the L'Oreal company that some of their shiny hair products are enhanced by Light Reflecting Booster Technology. I am appalled that they continue to make this claim in their television adverts despite numerous letters urging them to desist. Well, I have been provoked far enough. Here at Hooting Yard we will be suing L'Oreal for infringement of intellectual property rights. Regular readers will be aware that every single word that appears on this website, and every word broadcast in the associated podcasts, could not have been wrenched from the innermost depths of Mr Key's soul without Hooting Yard's very own Light Reflecting Booster Technology. We got there first, L'Oreal!</p>
  <p>P.S.&nbsp;: If anyone can recommend a suitably shabby and cheap solicitor, please get in touch. Because I'm worth it.</p>
