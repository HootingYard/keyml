  <h1 id="post-13128">How To Act Like A Sensible Person</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Over in the right-hand column, below the pictures of the Hooting Yard book covers, there languishes a little orange button inscribed with the words “Make a donation”. Below this is another little chunk of text inviting you to subscribe, which basically means you automatically make a donation every month. Over the years, both the button and the text have tempted the occasional reader, and I am very grateful for their support. (They know who they are.)</p>
  <p>Today I was reading David Thompson's excellent <strong><a href="http://davidthompson.typepad.com/davidthompson/" class="external">blog</a></strong> and I felt impelled, after a smidgeon of judicious editing, to copy and paste a passage from a recent postage:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Patrons are reminded that this rickety barge is kept afloat, just about, by the kindness of strangers. If you've been remotely entertained over the years and would like to help this dubious endeavour remain buoyant a while longer, there's an orange button below with which to monetise any love. Debit and credit cards are of course accepted. Think of it as a magazine subscription.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">This is a very sensible piece of prose, and I urge you to act on it. Make a one-off donation by clicking the button below, or a regular monthly donation by heading over to that paragraph on the right.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="noindent"><strong>NOTA BENE</strong> : For the avoidance of any doubt, following the guidance above will of course result in donations to Hooting Yard. If, in addition, or instead, you wish to donate to David Thompson, go <strong><a href="http://davidthompson.typepad.com/davidthompson/2014/08/it-will-only-encourage-him.html" class="external">here</a></strong>.</p>
