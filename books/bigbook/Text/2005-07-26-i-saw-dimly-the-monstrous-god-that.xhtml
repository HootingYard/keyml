  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“I saw, dimly, the monstrous god that had been known in Mamurth in ages past. It was like a giant spider, with angled limbs that were yards long, and a hairy, repellent body. Even as I stood there, I wondered that the thing, invisible as it was, was yet visible by the life-blood in it… When I passed the thing, the intolerable odour of a crushed insect almost smothered me, and the monster itself made frantic efforts to loosen itself and spring at me. But it could not, and I got safely down, shuddering and hardly able to walk.” — Edmond Hamilton, <em>The Monster-God Of Mamurth</em></p>
