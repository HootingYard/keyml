  <h1>That Mrs Gubbins Self-portrait</h1>
  <p>On 17th March we promised that a signed self-portrait of Mrs Gubbins would be made available to readers.</p>
  <div class="illustration">

  </div>
  <p>I am afraid that the picture, which indeed bears a striking resemblance to Mrs Gubbins, is in fact a forgery. Our art consultant, Vidiadhar Engineer, has subjected the portrait to a battery of often alarming tests, some of which involve volatile chemicals, and has concluded that “the penmanship could not have come from Mrs Gubbins' palsy-withered hand. It is clearly a fake.” Reader Sam Byrne has confessed to the imposture, and Mrs Gubbins has been arrested.</p>
