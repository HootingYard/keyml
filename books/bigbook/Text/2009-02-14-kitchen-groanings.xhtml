  <h1 id="post-1802">Kitchen Groanings</h1>
  <p><em>“Kitchen Groanings addressed to the Parlour</em>&nbsp;: a pamphlet so called, published fifty years ago. It is the spirited remonstrance of some angry cook-wench, or discontented housemaid, against lazy footmen with their ruffles, their canes, their bags, and powdered heads, who run away with the pecuniary perquisites, or, as they were at that period called, <em>vails</em>, without having their due proportion of the hard work of the house. This publication is said to have been actually produced by one of the sisterhood, whose cause it pleads; and, considering the quarter from whence it issued, is not badly written.”</p>
  <p>From <em>Anecdotiana; or, A Library of Anecdote. Facts and Opinions, Historical, Biographical, Critical &amp;c. Collected and Recorded by An Eminent Literary Character</em> (I. J. Chidley, London 1841)</p>
  <p>I am not quite sure, but I think Dobson may have produced a <em>Kitchen Groanings</em> pamphlet of his own.</p>
