  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer old person half demon and half man who has an idol-shop in a byway of the City and who keeps me informed of affairs of the Edge of the World. And briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information: that Mr. Neepy Thang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World and was even now in London.” — Lord Dunsany, <em>The Last Book Of Wonder</em></p>
