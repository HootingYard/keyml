  <h1>Waxy Insensibility</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Another letter arrives from Max Décharné, wit, sage, and originator of the well-known catchphrase “Well, tie me to a tree and call me Barry”. Max writes to say that, in his recent reading, he learned of the now-neglected British surrealist painter Robin Ironside. “When he wasn't designing the four-foot obelisk in Sevenhampton churchyard which commemorates Ian Fleming,” writes Max, “Ironside painted pictures with titles that might appeal to you.” They do, they do. Here are the titles of six paintings from the 1940s:</p>
  <p><em>Street Entertainer Playing Threatening Music To A Cinema Queue</em></p>
  <p><em>A Picture To Prove That The Greeks Only Painted With Three Colours</em></p>
  <p><em>Wounded Man In Bed-sitting Room</em></p>
  <p><em>Crowd Awaiting A Portent</em></p>
  <p><em>Famous Statues Visiting A Museum Of People</em></p>
  <p><em>Patients Suffering From Waxy Insensibility</em></p>
  <p>I have not been able to track down any reproductions on the web: perhaps an enthusiastic reader can do further research?</p>
