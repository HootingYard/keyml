  <h1 id="post-2904">Old Ground</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Here are some of the topics I have considered writing about today, in no particular order…</p>
  <p>The interior workings of the brain of a moose.</p>
  <p>The delivery of a brand new Snodgrass-Ponsonby Machine, to replace one sent for repair.</p>
  <p>Two Mossad agents playing pingpong in a dismal hangar.</p>
  <p>Nelson Eddy, by a waterfall, calling “you-oo-oo-oo”, to Jeanette Macdonald, because he has sprained his ankle and wants her to call an air ambulance.</p>
  <p>A map of Vange, with all its unmarked pathways marked.</p>
  <p>A discursive yet exhaustive history of the unbutton.</p>
  <p>… but each of these subjects has been done to death by Dobson, in a series of pamphlets. It is true that the pamphlets are out of print, but it's old ground, old ground. I think I shall instead turn my hand to a mashed potato waltz, and whistle down the wind.</p>
