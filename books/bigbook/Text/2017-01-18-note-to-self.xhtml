  <h1 id="post-15129">Note To Self</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Yesterday I <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archives/15121">mentioned</a>,</strong> in passing, Will Self. This is never a good idea. I am reminded, however, that I really need to stamp my big black boot down and make something very clear. First, back in 2009, we had the <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archives/1916">question</a></strong> posed “Is Frank Key Will Self?” And now, just the other day, this:</p>

  <p class="noindent">While I am flattered by Mr Bugs’ complimentary remarks, I am equally appalled to find myself compared in any way with the preposterous figure of Self. Perhaps the most laughable thing is the idea that he is some kind of edgy intellectual maverick. From his many appearances in the <em>Grauniad</em> and on the BBC, I think it is clear that he is in possession of the <strong><a href="https://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/06/dabbler-diary-a-holiday-from-oneself/" class="external">Middle-Class Student Wanker's starter pack marked ‘This is what you think’</a></strong>. All his opinions are predictable and orthodox. If there is such a thing as the “metropolitan liberal elite”, he is a card-carrying member. For example, he believes that <em>everyone</em> who voted for Brexit is probably a racist. Such simplistic twaddle will always get you applause and whooping from a <em>Question Time</em> audience, a fairly reliable indicator of vacuous dimwittery.</p>
  <p>I fear, however, that I will forever be linked with the wretched Self, given that his one useful <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archives/1916">contribution</a></strong> to the world was giving Mr Key a light for his cigarette in the midst of a downpour in south London.</p>
