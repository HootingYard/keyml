  <p>Dear Mr. Key, <em>she writes,</em> I've found a book which put me in mind of Hooting Yard which I would like to pass along, “The Infant Moralist” by Lady Helena Carnegie and Mrs. Arthur Jacob, published in 1903. Public domain versions of the book, with a delightfully illustrated copy of the original, are located <strong><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/infantmoralist00carn" class="external">here</a></strong></p>
  <p>It contains some of the usual moral lessons on “The Consequences of Greed”, “Profanity”, “Envy”, “Courage”, etc. What caught my attention were the less commonly heard ones: “Insensate Mischief”, “Inevitable Retribution”, “Unsuitable Jesting”, and “Ill-Timed Levity”.</p>
  <p>And this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>THE CHATTERBOX</p>
    <p>I needs must beg you, Caroline,</p>
    <p>To cease your Chatter whilst I dine.</p>
    <p>It deafens every Ear.</p>
    <p>John Footman cannot hear my Words,</p>
    <p>And I have asked him twice for Curds</p>
    <p>And still he cannot hear.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If Caroline were with us today she would undoubtedly have a cell phone out at the dinner table as well. Anyway, all fine moral lessons and a good addition to any library. It also occurs to me that this book might be a superior replacement for the usual deadly dull workplace employee handbook.</p>
