  <h1>Thimble Of Everything</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose” is perhaps Gertrude Stein's most memorable utterance. It first appeared in the 1913 poem <strong><em><a href="http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=6082895" class="external">Sacred Emily</a></em></strong> (published in 1922 in the collection <em>Geography And Plays</em>) as “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose”, the first Rose being a proper name. There are other lines in the poem of which I am very fond, including:</p>
  <p><em>It is rose in hen… Weeds without papers are necessary… Humming does as humming is… Electrics are tight electrics are white electrics are a button…&nbsp; A very reasonable berry… A coral neck and a little song so very extra so very Susie… Cow come out cow come out and out and smell a little… Websters and mines, websters and mines… Cunning piler… Thimble of everything.</em></p>
