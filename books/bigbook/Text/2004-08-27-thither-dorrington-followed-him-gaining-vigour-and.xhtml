  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Thither Dorrington followed him, gaining vigour and fury at every step. At sight of him the wretched Mallows sank in a corner, sighing and shivering with terror. Dorrington hauled the struggling wretch across the room, tearing off the crepe whiskers as he came, while Mallows supplicated and whined, fearing that it might be the other's design to imprison him in the enamelling oven.” — Arthur Morrison, <em>The Affair Of The Avalanche Bicycle &amp; Tyre Co., Ltd</em>.</p>
