  <h1 id="post-5509">Wolfenbüttel Footnote</h1>
  <p>Readers who keep track of these things will know that I am fond of Horace Walpole's coinage “bewolfenbuttlement”, recently noted in my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2010/10/keys-cupboard-bewolfenbuttled/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>. I have today learned that Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, that great figure of the Enlightenment, was for some years the librarian at the Herzog-August-Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel. In the 1770s, he published, anonymously, the <em>Wolfenbüttel Fragments</em>, essays by the (deceased) Professor of Oriental Languages at Hamburg, Reimarus, questioning the status of miracles recounted in the Bible.</p>
  <p>His skepticism in this regard means Lessing is one of the few European thinkers who has a ditch named after him. It is an <strong><a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/02/lessings-ugly-broad-ditch.html" class="external">ugly, broad ditch</a></strong>, but, disappointingly, is a theoretical ditch rather than a real one.</p>
  <p>He also had an interestingly egg-shaped head.</p>
