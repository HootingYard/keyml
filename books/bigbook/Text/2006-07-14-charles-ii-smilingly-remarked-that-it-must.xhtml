  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“[Charles II] smilingly remarked that it must surely have been his own fault that he did not come back sooner, for he saw no one who did not protest that he had always longed for his return. One Dobson, a miller at Charlton, in Kent, burnt his windmill as a bonfire for joy.” — Professor Meikeljohn, <em>The History Of England And Great Britain</em> (Thanks, Max)</p>
