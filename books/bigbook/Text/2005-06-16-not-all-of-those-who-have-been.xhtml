  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Not all of those who have been stimulated by the new freedom of speech to thrust themselves forward as teachers of sex hygiene, and as social reformers, are safe leaders. Some are ignorant and unaware that enthusiasm is not a satisfactory substitute for knowledge. Some are hysterical. At a recent purity convention, a woman said, ‘I know little about the facts, but it is wonderful how much ignorance can accomplish when accompanied by devotion and persistence’. That declaration was applauded.” — William Trufant Foster, <em>The Social Emergency&nbsp;: Studies In Sex Hygiene And Morals</em></p>
