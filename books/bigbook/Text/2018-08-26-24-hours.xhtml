  <p>Exciting news from ResonanceFM,,,,</p>
  <p><strong>Bank Holiday Monday, 27 August&nbsp;: 12:00amâ€”11:59pm.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Twenty four hours in the company of Frank Key, writer in residence and creator of Resonance's longest running programme, Hooting Yard on the Air. Comprising a selection of programmes from the very first in April 2004 to the present day.</strong></p>
  <p>It has been an eerily quiet summer here at Hooting Yard, what with one ting and an udder (as my mother used to say). I hope to return to the land of the living soon.</p>
