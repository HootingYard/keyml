  <h1>History Lesson</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Last year, I drew to your attention Brit's capsule <strong><a href="2010-09-01-77-words.xhtml" class="internal" title="77 Words">history of Britain</a></strong>, 1939â€“2010, in seventy-seven words. Now another indefatigable blogger, the esteemed <strong><a href="http://wartimehousewife.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/bicycle-bicycle-bicycle-bicycle-rack/" class="external">Wartime Housewife</a></strong>, has managed to sum up the history of England in just seven words:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">England wasn't built on glamour and competence.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">If tinies were still taught anything approaching history in their Self-Esteem Workshop Community Hubs, that would make a perfect essay title. Discuss.</p>
