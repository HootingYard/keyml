  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Sometimes, with their bony limbs flung forth in gnarled unnatural gestures, they remind me of frantic skeletons suddenly petrified in their dance of death. They are frenzied, and unutterably tragic. They seem to move; yet they are so dead. And I imagine their denuded tortured arms reaching toward unanswering Heaven in an agony of protest against the fate that has gripped all nature.” — Katherine Shortall, <em>Where The Sabots Clatter Again</em></p>
