  <p><em>Is stoning ever justified?</em></p>
  <p><em>“It depends what sort of stoning and what circumstances,” he replies.</em></p>
  <p>– From an interview with Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari, leader of the Muslim Council of Britain, in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, 10th November 1007… sorry, 2007.</p>
  <p>It goes without saying that stoning to death is the only proper way of dealing with certain crimes, but as Dr Bari so wisely says, one has to be clear about what <em>sort</em> of stoning. That is why Hooting Yard is pleased to announce a soon-to-be-out-of-print pamphlet entitled <em>How To Choose The Right Sort Of Stoning To Death For Ne'er-Do-Wells.</em> This helpful work gives tips on many different techniques of throwing rocks at defenceless women until they are dead.</p>
