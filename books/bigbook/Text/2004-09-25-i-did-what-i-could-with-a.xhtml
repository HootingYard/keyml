  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“I did what I could with a hunting-knife and forceps, without dyes or microscope, swallowing my nausea — it was a nauseating thing! — memorizing what I found. But, as the sun rose higher, the thing liquefied, melted, until by nine o'clock there was nothing but a glutinous gray puddle, with two green eyes swimming in it. And these eyes — I can see them now — burst with a thick pop, making a detestable sticky ripple in that puddle of corruption.” — Gerald Kersh, <em>Men Without Bones</em></p>
