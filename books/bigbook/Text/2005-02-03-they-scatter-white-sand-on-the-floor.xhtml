  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“They scatter white sand on the floor every morning. They keep their houses very clean. In their kitchens they have open fireplaces, with fires blazing brightly. Near the fires they have footstools made of cork. In some houses they have fire boxes for warming their feet. They can carry these boxes wherever they like. In cold weather they take their fire boxes to church.” — Edward R Shaw, <em>Big People And Little People Of Other Lands</em></p>
