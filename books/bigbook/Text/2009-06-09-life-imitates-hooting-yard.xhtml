  <h1 id="post-2505">Life Imitates Hooting Yard</h1>
  <p>There are times, I think, when the gods who order our puny human affairs take their lead from Hooting Yard. How else to explain this magnificent headline?</p>
  <p><em><strong><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8089498.stm" class="external">MP Blunkett injured in cow attack</a></strong></em></p>
  <p>Incidentally, it is somewhat disconcerting that the BBC feels it necessary to qualify the numinous Blunkett name with the designation “MP”, as if there might be other newsworthy Blunketts in the known universe. There are not.</p>
  <p>I am going to go on a little trip now. I will be gone only for a couple of days, and will return in time for this week's <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> at teatime on Thursday. I live in hope that a brief change of scene, and the thought of that cow, will loosen up the cranial integuments, the knotting of which has caused such regrettable silence of late.</p>
