  <h1>Today's Dietary Tip</h1>
  <p>Having got rid of your piles yesterday by smearing yourself with boar's grease, it's time for a treat. Here is a splendid snacking idea from the <em>Book Of Fruits &amp; Flowers</em>:</p>
  <p><em>To make Printed Quidony of Quinces.</em> Take two pound of Quinces, paired, coared, and cut in small pieces, and put them into a faire posnet, with a quart of faire water, and when they are boyled tender, put into them one pound of Sugar clarified, with halfe a pint of faire water, let them boyle till all the fruit fall to the bottom of the posnet, then let the liquid substance run through a faire linnen cloath into a clean bason, then put it into a posnet, and let it boyle till it come to a jelly, then Print it in your Moulds, and turne it into your boxes. You shall know when it is ready to Print, by rouling it on the back of a Spoone.</p>
