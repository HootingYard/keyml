  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Ayn Rand is the greatest human being who has ever lived. <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> is the greatest human achievement in the history of the world. Since Ayn Rand has designated Nathaniel Branden as her ‘intellectual heir’ and has repeatedly proclaimed him to be an ideal exponent of her philosophy, he is to be accorded only marginally less reverence than Ayn Rand herself.” — Nathaniel Branden, <em>Judgment Day&nbsp;: My Years With Ayn Rand</em></p>
