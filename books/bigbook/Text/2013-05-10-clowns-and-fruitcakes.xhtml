  <p>This week in my cupboard at <em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/05/letter-from-an-inept-spy/" class="external"><strong>The Dabbler</strong></a></em>, you will find a letter from an inept foreign spy sent on a mission to discover what in heaven's name is going on in the Westminster bubble. I managed to decipher the enciphered text using incredibly complicated code-breaking techniques devised by Snippage, the code-breaker <em>extraordinaire</em>, who cut his chops on Dobson's mysterious pamphlet <em>Several Observations On Kathy Kirby, Composed In A Cipher So Baffling That Centuries May Pass Before Anybody Will Be Able To Wring Any Sense From It</em> (out of print). Of course, Snippage failed to decipher the pamphlet <em>in toto</em>, but without his efforts we would not even know the title, which is given on the cover as <em>Gwzhfgsjlf seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter klrtfghsdjwi</em> (uto fo pirnt).</p>
