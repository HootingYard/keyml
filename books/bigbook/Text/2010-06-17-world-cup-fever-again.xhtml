  <h1>World Cup Fever, Again</h1>
  <p>We know that the important thing about any televised <strong><a href="2010-06-17-world-cup-fever.xhtml" class="internal" title="World Cup Fever">foopball</a></strong> match is the demented wittering of the commentators. The 2010 World Cup has, in that sense, reached its climax with just a week of matches played. For I do not believe any commentator, however bonkers, will be able to better the stupendous words declaimed during tonight's France v. Mexico tie:</p>
  <p>“For a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who'd just plopped out of the womb.”</p>
