  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“In form and movement the woodchuck is not captivating. His body is heavy and flabby. Indeed, such a flaccid, fluid, pouchy carcass, I have never before seen. It has absolutely no muscular tension or rigidity, but is as baggy and shaky as a skin filled with water.” — John Burroughs, <em>Birds And Bees, Sharp Eyes And Other Papers</em></p>
