  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“In an instant, the whole mass of ice, extending for several miles from the coast, and as far as the eye could reach, burst, and was overwhelmed by the rolling waves. The sight was tremendous and awfully grand; the large fields of ice raising themselves out of the water, striking against each other, and plunging into the deep, with a violence not to be described, and a noise like the discharge of innumerable batteries of heavy guns. The darkness of the night; the roaring of the wind and the sea, and the dashing of the waves and ice against the rocks, filled the travellers with sensations of awe and horror, so as almost to deprive them of the power of utterance.” — Anonymous, <em>Dangers On The Ice Off The Coast Of Labrador, With Some Interesting Particulars Respecting the Natives of that Country, Printed for the Religious Tract Society, London</em></p>
