  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Does any boy's conscience smite him at my naming the insects? I hope not. I hope you have not been tempted by Satan to do any harm to the little harmless, and often useful, creatures that cross your path. A butterfly, a cockchaffer, a house-fly, a snail, a caterpillar, a worm—these, and all others, are God's handy-work; and if you could see them through a glass that magnifies very much indeed, you would be more astonished than I can tell you.” — Charlotte Elizabeth, <em>Kindness To Animals, Or, The Sin Of Cruelty Exposed And Rebuked</em></p>
