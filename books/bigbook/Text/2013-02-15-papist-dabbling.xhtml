  <p>Over at <em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/02/pope-pius-xiis-ripening-delusions-of-grandeur/" class="external"><strong>The Dabbler</strong></a></em> this week I offer some advice to the conclave of cardinals before they gather to elect a new Pontiff. I would quite like to be Pope myself, standing on a balcony bestowing blessings upon a throng of the faithful. Alas, I am afraid that just at the time the redhats gather in Rome I shall be rejoining the international jet set and heading off in the opposite direction, bent on important Hooting Yard business in the New World. Further details to follow, but any fanatical devotees who are in New York City on the fourth of March may wish to clear their diaries.</p>
