  <p>Another brief Hooting hiatus may be afoot. Well, not afoot, exactly, rather ahead, for the head is the home of the eyes. As readers will be aware, the Key eyes have lately been pitiful things, subjected to all sorts of medical procedures. Tomorrow I shall be off to the hospital again for an op. It may be that reading and writing will be difficult until such time as I obtain new reading specs with a new prescription. While I am gone, you can rummage around in the archives. Type a word or phrase into the search box above and see what buried treasures you unearth.</p>
