  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Sir Hubert von Herkomer was a Bavarian-born painter who founded an art school in Bushey [Hertfordshire] in the 1880s, and can also claim the distinction of having concocted, in a series of narrative paintings, all the Welsh druidic paraphernalia we now associate with that country's Celtic prehistory. Herkomer made it all up in his studio, and his clients, rich Welsh industrialists, propagated his work at <em>ersatz</em> jamborees like the National Eisteddfod.” — Matthew Sweet, <em>Inventing The Victorians</em></p>
