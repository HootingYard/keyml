  <h1 id="post-5330">T</h1>
  <p class="noindent">T is for Taylor, more precisely Joseph Taylor, author of <em>Apparitions or, The Mystery of Ghosts, Hobgoblins, and Haunted Houses Developed. Being A Collection Of Entertaining Stories, Founded On Fact, And Selected For The Purpose Of Eradicating Those Fears, Which The Ignorant, The Weak, And The Superstitious, Are But Too Apt To Encourage, For Want Of Properly Examining Into The Causes Of Such Absurd Impositions (</em>1815), wherein he remarks, <em>inter alia</em>, “idiots in general are remarkably fond of any thing relative to a funeral procession”. Well worth bearing in mind, I think.</p>
