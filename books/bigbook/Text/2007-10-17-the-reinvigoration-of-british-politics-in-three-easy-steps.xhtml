  <h1 id="post-256">The Reinvigoration Of British Politics In Three Easy Steps</h1>
  <p>Here is my three-step plan to reinvigorate British politics.</p>
  <p>Step One&nbsp;: The Liberal Democrats elect Chris Huhne as their next leader.</p>
  <p>Step Two&nbsp;: A cabinet <em>putsch</em> in the Labour Party sees Geoff Hoon oust Gordon Brown.</p>
  <p>Step Three&nbsp;: Returning to their roots, the Conservatives ditch David Cameron and replace him with a proper toff, Lord Home. As is the way with the aristocracy, his name is not simply pronounced as it looks, but as “Hume”.</p>
  <p>Done and dusted.</p>
