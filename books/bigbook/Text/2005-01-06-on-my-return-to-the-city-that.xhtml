  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“On my return to the city that night, I felt a positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. It was alight as though a small sun was located in it and I passed the whole night applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally the flashes diminished in frequency and force but it took more than three weeks before they wholly subsided. These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time… but they are no longer exciting.” — Nikola Tesla, <em>The Strange Life Of Nikola Tesla</em></p>
