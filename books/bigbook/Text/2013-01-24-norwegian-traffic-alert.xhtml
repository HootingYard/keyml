  <h1 id="post-10900">Norwegian Traffic Alert</h1>
  <p class="noindent">So there I was, standing by a Norwegian roadside as smoke from a blazing consignment of Norwegian goat cheese billowed in goaty cheesy gusts. Luckily, standing next to me was Kjell Bjoern Vinje of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.</p>
  <p>“Tell me, Kjell Bjoern Vinje,” I shouted, “Can you recall any previous occasions when cheese has caught fire on Norwegian roads?”</p>
  <p>I did not catch his reply, but a <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21141244" class="external">BBC News</a></strong> reporter did.</p>
