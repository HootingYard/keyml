  <h1 id="post-13190">Laughter In The Dark</h1>
  <p>Having been somewhat disconsolate of late, for reasons I need not bore you with (but hence the silence here), I needed a laugh, and was rewarded this morning. In the <em>Guardian</em>, Suzanne Goldenberg interviews Naomi Klein.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>She flies, already a lot more than most people, and is set to rack up air miles that would make her, by her own admission, “a climate criminal” … Yet she confesses to getting weepy when she thinks about the future under climate change.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Imagine poor Naomi sobbing her heart out. But not to worry …</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>She says she is not going to be trapped into “gotcha games” about personal habits.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Speaking of the <em>Guardian</em>, Rod Liddle has an amusing line about the online video lectures delivered by Russell Brand:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>like a condensed version of a particularly bad edition of the <em>Guardian</em>, filtered through the veins of an imbecile.</p>
  </blockquote>
