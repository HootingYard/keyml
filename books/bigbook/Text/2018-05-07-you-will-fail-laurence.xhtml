  <h1 id="post-16516">You Will Fail, Laurence</h1>
  <p><em>You Will Fail, Laurence</em> is the title of a book which appeared to me in my dreams last night. It was a children's book, written in very short, staccato sentences, and lavishly illustrated with detailed, brightly-coloured drawings—in spite of the fact that Laurence spent much of his time enveloped in what my dream insisted on calling “fog-storms”.</p>
  <p>An additional curiosity was that I was looking at a facsimile of the book online, and the dream suggested that the book itself did not exist, this digital version being a hoax perpetrated by japesters for reasons which must remain unutterably mysterious.</p>
