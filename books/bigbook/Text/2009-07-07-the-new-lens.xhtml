  <h1 id="post-2586">The New Lens</h1>
  <p>I have just heard someone on the news talking about “the new lens”. He did not explain the nature of this optical device, nor whether it was a replacement for an old lens fallen into disrepair or desuetude. As far as I can gather, from the meagre information provided, the new lens is the device through which everything henceforth ought to be viewed—or perhaps peered at, myopically, with much befuddled blinking. I will be placing an order for a goodly supply of the new lenses, if more than one is available, so rest assured that your favourite website will on no account be regarding the world in some hopelessly old fashioned way. Take due note—Hooting Yard! Forward With The New Lens!</p>
