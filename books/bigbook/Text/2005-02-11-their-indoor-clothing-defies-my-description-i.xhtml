  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Their indoor clothing defies my description. I can only say that the colours they wore dazzled me, and that I was almost deafened by the jangling of beads when they moved. In contrast to this was their dress when they worked out-of-doors, as they frequently did. Then they wore duffle coats with hoods, trousers, and very often gum-boots. They might have been mistaken for industrious gnomes.” — Miles Burton, <em>Death In A Duffle Coat</em></p>
