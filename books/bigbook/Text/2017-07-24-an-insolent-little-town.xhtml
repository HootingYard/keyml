  <h1 id="post-15471">An Insolent Little Town</h1>
  <p class="noindent">One of the places I visited on my recent holiday was described to me as “an insolent little town, turning its back on the tortured sea”. Tortured the sea may have been, but it was neither dolphin-torn nor gong-tormented, though given my guide's turns of phrase perhaps it ought to have been. Among the sights of the town—snapped by Pansy Cradledew—was this absurd <em>flaneur</em> prancing like a ninny along the boulevards before posing for the camera.</p>
