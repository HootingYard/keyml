  <h1>Smooching With Istvan</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Many, many women, and not a few men, have their stories of the time they smooched with Istvan. Their recollections have been anthologised in a new book, entitled <em>Smooching With Istvan</em>, in which they reminisce about their smooching. One of those whose memories are not included is alleged Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, who is known to have smooched with Istvan in a Fort Worth, Texas nightclub early in 1963, soon after his return from the Soviet Union. <em>His</em>, there, refers to Oswald, not Istvan, although Istvan had himself visited the USSR (or, in Cyrillic, the CCCP) on many occasions, smooching with Olga, Natasha, Yuri, Boris and Svetlana, among others.</p>
  <p>It has to be said that most of these tales are mundane, boring, even unreadable. From time to time, however, the diligent reader comes upon a nugget of splendour, such as this brief passage from an unnamed resident of the Land Adjunct To The Frightening Sea:</p>
  <p>“Titlarks sang, German <em>lieder</em> singers gathered, petunias and hellebore were in bloom, and a new DVD of <em>William Betty : The Young Roscius</em> was at last available in the shops. I pootled off to the dancehall planning little more than an evening of glum pinch-mouthed misery. But Istvan was there! I smooched with him for two hours. His cravat was so, so dashing. Now as I sit in my beach hut peering intently at auks and terns through my binoculars, I think of that night, and my heart pounds with something which may well be excitement.”</p>
  <p>Copies of <em>Smooching With Istvan</em> are not yet available, as they have been impounded by shadowy figures wearing tunics woven from thousands upon thousands of hairs plucked from pipistrelle bats.</p>
