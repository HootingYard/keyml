  <h1>Pick Some Words &amp; Save Resonance</h1>
  <p>The world's finest radio station, Resonance104.4FM, is in urgent need of funding. You can help the station remain on air by sponsoring next week's <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> show, to be broadcast (live as ever) at 4.00 PM on Wednesday 14 February. Here is how it works:</p>
  <p>1. Go to <a href="http://www.resonancefm.com" class="external">Resonance</a> and donate a minimum of Â£5.</p>
  <p>2. You may now choose a sentence, a phrase, a string of words, or a name to be incorporated into a specially-written story which will feature on next week's show.</p>
  <p>3. Send your chosen words to me at <span class="broken" title="This mailbox is defunct.">hooting.yard@googlemail.com</span>, and <em>voila!</em>, it's as simple as that.</p>
  <p>4. After reading the story, I will recite the names of the donors (unless anonymity is preferred).</p>
  <p>5. Now follow Step 1, immediately!</p>
