  <h1 id="post-15723">Another House Of Turps</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Older readers will recall <em>House Of Turps</em> as an out of print pamphlet published by the Malice Aforethought Press in 1989. That's how I recall it myself. But yesterday, rummaging in a midden, I came upon several sheets of buff paper, the typed manuscript of a piece also called <em>House Of Turps</em>. It bears no resemblance to the published text. It is the “Prologue” to what I clearly intended as a lengthy narrative poem which, equally clearly, I thereafter abandoned. For the benefit of scholars who, I know, devote their waking lives to poring over every syllable I have ever written, here is that fragment of the lost (until yesterday) <em>House Of Turps</em> …</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;Welcome to the House of Turps,<br />
  Riddled with visionaries, idiots, twerps,<br />
  Bores, poltroons, maniacs, cranks,<br />
  Of the highest and the lowest ranks;<br />
  Raised and ruined, rich and poor –<br />
  What brings them all to the same door?<br />
  A vision of a visionary world.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Each year a pennant is unfurled<br />
  From the very top of the House's walls,<br />
  In howling wind, as the mercury falls,<br />
  As winter bites. Ice grips the land.<br />
  Each member of our demented band<br />
  Bids fare thee well to home, kith, kin,<br />
  And with a doomed and gritty grin<br />
  Sets forth upon a long slow trudge<br />
  Towards a circular bank of sludge.<br />
  This sludge-bank bars the trudgers’ way.<br />
  To cross it takes near half a day,<br />
  Weighed down by netting, pig-iron shoes,<br />
  Tourniquets, gum, a supply of booze,<br />
  Branches, forks, baize and bait –<br />
  All gifts for the Keeper at the gate,<br />
  The unfurler of the Winter Flag.<br />
  He's eighty-nine. His name is Cragg.<br />
  The House of Turps depends on him.<br />
  His countenance is pale and grim.<br />
  His history's shadowy and obscure.<br />
  He's lived here since the age of four.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">As each guest lurches from the slime<br />
  Cragg makes a note of name and time<br />
  Scraped on the page with a blood-stained hook<br />
  In his huge registration book.<br />
  He slams it shut then barks: “Go flee<br />
  To room nineteen!” or “twenty-three!”.<br />
  The guests head off on a path of gravel<br />
  For they have not yet ceased to travel.<br />
  The House looms a further six miles’ trudge<br />
  Over gravel and pebbles, not slime or sludge.<br />
  Cragg remains, hard by the gate,<br />
  Until he's counted in all eight.<br />
  We'll leave him there, improbably dressed,<br />
  As we consider each mad guest.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">POTATO SMITH is sick at heart,<br />
  Festooned with rotten sacking.<br />
  He made a fortune in fine art.<br />
  His sense of humour's lacking.<br />
  Curt and shrivelled, eighty-five,<br />
  He likes to suck wood-splinters.<br />
  He is only just alive,<br />
  But comes here every winter.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">PRIMROSE LEEK, a friend to ants,<br />
  Is only thirty-two.<br />
  She wears black hat, black coat, black pants,<br />
  She's also known as Sue.<br />
  Though dumb in summer, at the House<br />
  She speaks the lingua franca.<br />
  She murdered Hector Lockjaw Frowse,<br />
  The international banker.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Then there's DR RUFUS GLUBB,<br />
  The noted bandage-stainer.<br />
  His head looks like a bakelite tub<br />
  Topped by a bent tea-strainer.<br />
  His belly has grown to a pot<br />
  From eating too much custard.<br />
  The other guests loathe him a lot<br />
  But think he cuts the mustard.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Our fourth pal has a widow's peak,<br />
  Looks not unlike a panda.<br />
  C. T. PUCK's part-Dutch, part-Greek,<br />
  Half-blind and part-Greenlander.<br />
  She lives on a diet of gruel and slops<br />
  And vats of sour beer.<br />
  You can't buy those things in the shops,<br />
  But Cragg supplies them here.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">LASCELLES DISTEMPER JARLEY<br />
  Has no sense of direction.<br />
  He is a proper Charlie<br />
  And has a cork collection.<br />
  He says “by Jove!” and “golly gosh!”<br />
  And other dumbkopf phrases.<br />
  He talks a huge amount of tosh<br />
  And he is prone to crazes.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">OLD DOGMOUTH's fits are legion.<br />
  He broke his wooden legs.<br />
  Like others from his region<br />
  He sets fire to hard-boiled eggs.<br />
  Cragg and he are so alike<br />
  They could share the same mother,<br />
  But Cragg was once an orphan tyke<br />
  And Dogmouth has no brother.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">SISTER GERTIE of the Cross<br />
  Is a religious nutter.<br />
  She roams the land astride her “Hoss”,<br />
  A goat, a fractious butter.<br />
  Moths have fluttered round her head,<br />
  Its incandescent light<br />
  Proof that she is not quite dead<br />
  But shining, dazzling bright.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">The last of the guests at the turpentine House<br />
  Has crutches painted yellow.<br />
  His head is cracked, he's such a louse,<br />
  He's such a grotesque fellow.<br />
  Watch him grow warts upon his ears,<br />
  Watch him act agitator.<br />
  He's quite as vile as he appears –<br />
  NED HELLHOUND, your narrator.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">So now we've met this motley crew,<br />
  On with our tale of derring-do.</p>
