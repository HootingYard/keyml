  <h1 id="post-23">Concrete Boats</h1>
  <p>I was reading <a href="http://www.davidbodanis.com/pages/Electric_universe_pg.html" class="external"><strong>Electric Universe</strong></a> by David Bodanis, and was struck by his comment that Thomas Alva Edison spent an inordinate amount of his time working on plans for a concrete boat. It pleases me to learn that J L Lambot got there before him, in 1848. See <a href="http://www.tecnologos.it/Articoli/articoli/numero_010/concrete.asp" class="external">A Short History Of Concrete</a>.</p>
