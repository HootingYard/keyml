  <h1>Train Your Brain</h1>
  <p>In a culture dominated by pap, it is ever more important to exercise our brains and keep them supple. There are countless techniques for giving our craniums (crania?) a boost, activities which seem to have little or no practical utility but send our synapses a-buzzing. Chess, crosswords, and numerical puzzles are popular, and an alarming number of people pay homage at the altar of brain guru Tony Buzan, he of the sepulchral voice and sinister black cape.</p>

  <p>At Hooting Yard we have devised a new method. It's cheap, simple, and—most importantly—fun<span class="asterisk">*</span>, and we're very pleased to launch it today with a special gala in the field next to the Blister Lane Bypass, which you will probably have missed by the time you read this.</p>
  <p>Set to become a popular craze, <em>Memorise All The Place-Names In Finland (Suomi)™</em> can be played by young and old alike. Over the next few years, we will be listing all the place-names in Finland (Suomi), in no particular order, a dozen at a time. All you need to do is commit them to memory, perhaps while eating your breakfast. You may wish to be a solo player, or you can gather with other <em>Memorise All The Place-Names In Finland (Suomi)™</em> players and hold tournaments. Overexcitement can be a risk at such events, so please take advice from your doctor if you suffer from any perilous ailments.</p>
  <p>To start you off, here are the first twelve Finnish place-names: Petäjäjärvi, Enonlahti, Tuukkala, Hööpakka, Torp, Aho, Sund, Maarianhamina, Eugmo, Törmäsenvaara, Korkeakangas, Lumparland.</p>
  <p><span class="mark">*NOTE&nbsp;:</span> A caveat. One must always bear in mind the immortal words of Dr Robert Matthews—“You have to define fun or you will have none”.</p>
