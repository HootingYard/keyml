  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“About an hour before the ship was to leave her moorings, I went on board and made my way at once to the stateroom which I was to share with a fellow passenger, whose acquaintance I then made for the first time. He was a tall cadaverous young man of about my own age, and my first view of him was not encouraging, for when I came in, I found him rolling restlessly on the cabin floor, and uttering hollow groans. ‘This will never do,’ I said… He explained, somewhat brusquely, that he was suffering from mental agony, not seasickness.” — F Anstey, <em>The Curse Of The Catafalques</em></p>
