  <h1 id="post-14757">Collapsed Puffin</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Oh look, a puffin has collapsed on that floe.<br />
  Wipe the steam from your goggles and you will see it too.<br />
  We should airlift it to the puffin hospital yonder in our chopper.<br />
  Take those corks out of your ears so you can hear me speak.<br />
  Love is a mighty power, and I love puffins, as I love guillemots and auks and bonxies.<br />
  Snap those icicles dangling from your nose and you will breathe easier.<br />
  Here comes a blizzard. Oh, puffin, don't die.<br />
  Stamp your feet in your furry boots, my companion.<br />
  Two men and a collapsed puffin in a white wasteland.<br />
  Allegory of something or other.<br />
  The chopper blades are frozen, and we are stranded, or marooned.<br />
  Come, Squiffy, plod with me towards the puffin, that we may give it succour.<br />
  Love conquers all, if you will wipe those damned goggles!</p>
