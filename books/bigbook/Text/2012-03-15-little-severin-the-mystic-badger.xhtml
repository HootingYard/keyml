  <p>Those very sensible people at <strong><a href="http://www.unit-united.co.uk/" class="external">Unit</a></strong> have released a new double CD entitled “Civil Disobedience”, described by the fanzine <em>Fracture</em> as “the most relentlessly depressing pop album ever released”. I am delighted to tell you that it includes a three-minute instrumental entitled “Little Severin, The Mystic Badger (For Frank Key)” which you can listen to here:</p>
  <p><strong>♪ ♪ ♪</strong> <a href="../Media/2012-03-09-Little-Severin-The-Mystic-Badger.mp3" class="internal-audio" title="Little Severin, The Mystic Badger (For Frank Key), by Unit"><strong>Little Severin, The Mystic Badger</strong></a> <strong>♪ ♪ ♪</strong></p>
  <p>I would urge you to go straight to the Unit <strong><a href="http://www.unit-united.co.uk/" class="external">website</a></strong> and buy the album, but online purchase does not appear to be possible. Perhaps a Unit-person will add a comment telling readers how they can obtain this essential recording.</p>
