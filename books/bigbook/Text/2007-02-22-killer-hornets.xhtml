  <h1 id="post-73">Killer Hornets!</h1>
  <p>We like to keep abreast of the latest bee, wasp, and hornet news here at Hooting Yard. According to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/21/whornets21.xml" class="external">The Telegraph</a> our plucky British honeybees are at risk from swarms of killer hornets. The fiendish <em>Vespa velutinae</em> have reached France, where “thousands of football-shaped hornet nests are now dotted all over the forests of Aquitaine”. We will be setting up a Hornet Patrol soon, so drop us a line if you wish to volunteer. Badge, cap, and whistle provided.</p>
