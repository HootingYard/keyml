  <h1 id="post-5662">The Sausage In Western Art</h1>
  <p>From far California, my brother has sent me a snap of something so sausagey and preposterous that I feel compelled to share it with you. Constructed by a drama teacher who once put my nephew through his thespian paces, this is a Christian nativity scene made entirely from sausages and bacon. Warning&nbsp;: may contain sausages and bacon.</p>
