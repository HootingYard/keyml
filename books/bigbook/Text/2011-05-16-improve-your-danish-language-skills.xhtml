  <h1>Improve Your Danish Language Skills</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I noted <strong><a href="2011-05-16-oolississ.xhtml" class="internal" title="Oolississ">below</a></strong> that when my Flemish-speaking mother wanted to improve her English, she worked her way through the classics of literature. Nowadays, we just slump in front of the television and watch foreign-language thrillers on BBC4. Thus I have embarked upon a crash-course in Danish by watching, somewhat belatedly, <em>Forbrydelsen</em>, or <em>The Killing</em>, the highly popular murder ‘n’ knitwear detective series. Apart from being a splendid example of Nick Cohen's <strong><a href="http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/tv-may-11-politically-suspect-nick-cohen-midsommer-murders-lewis-ethnic-quotas-political-correctness-brian-true-may" class="external">observation</a></strong> that ethnic minorities are <em>never</em> the villains in BBC cop shows, the series has done wonders for my Danish language skills. I think I could successfully apply for an IT post in Copenhagen, armed with these additions to my vocabulary:</p>
  <p>English&nbsp;: computer. Danish&nbsp;: compuder.</p>
  <p>English&nbsp;: password. Danish&nbsp;: password.</p>
  <p>English&nbsp;: fuck-up. Danish&nbsp;: fuck-up.</p>
