  <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
  <p>The <em>Hooting Yard Treasury Of Recondite Yet Somehow Arresting Facts</em> is currently in preparation. After much thought, and a bowl of Mrs Gubbins' delicious soup, we decided to use a simple question-and-answer format for this mighty undertaking. Here is a sneak preview, especially for website readers:</p>
  <p>Q—Ayn Rand, the gravel-voiced amd dementedly right wing author of such pap as <em>The Fountainhead</em> (1943) and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> (1957) was, as we know, a keen collector of postage stamps<span class="asterisk">*</span>, but what I really want to know is the title of the song played at her funeral service in 1982. (I know that this is not phrased as a question, but bear with me.)</p>
  <p>A—The song played at Ayn Rand's funeral was <em>It's A Long Way To Tipperary</em>.</p>
