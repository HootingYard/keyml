      <p class="caption">Mrs Catherine Crowe, who wrote the best-selling <em>Night Side Of Nature</em> [1848], an enormous compilation of ghost stories, was found ‘in the street, clothed only in her chastity, a pocket-handkerchief, and a visiting-card. She had been informed, it appeared, by the spirits, that if she went in that trim she would be invisible’,</p>
