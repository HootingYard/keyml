  <h1 id="post-11470">Whimpers From My Bed Of Woe</h1>
  <p>While I languish in my sickbed glugging Lemsip and generally feeling woebegone, there are a couple of items I ought to bring to your attention.</p>
  <p>The first (courtesy of <strong><a href="http://liberalengland.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/giant-badger-causing-hysteria-at.html" class="external">Jonathan Calder</a></strong>) is this startling headline from <strong><a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentish_express/news/Giant-badger-1004/" class="external">Kent Online</a></strong>. I suspect this is one of those occasions when real life collides with a paperback potboiler by Pebblehead.</p>
  <p>The second is to inform you of a couple of books the existence of which I have recently learned. Recently and belatedly, given that both were published almost three hundred years ago. I am going to have to learn Dutch in order to read them:</p>
  <p>Jacobus Hondius, <em>Black Register Of A Thousand Sins</em> (1724)</p>
  <p>Anon,, <em>The Finger Of God, or Holland And Zeeland In Great Need From This Hitherto Unheard Plague Of Worms</em> (1731?)</p>
  <p>I ought to illustrate this postage with images of badgers and worms and sin, but instead I am going to fall into an uneasy and fevered sleep.</p>
