  <h1 id="post-6437">The Land Of Cheese And Wine</h1>
  <p>I have been called many things in my time—“Mr Key” and “a <strong><a href="http://www.rermegacorp.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=ReRVril2&amp;Category_Code=&amp;Store_Code=RM" class="external">Diogenesian recluse</a></strong>” are two that spring to mind—but the one I particularly treasure is “the anti-Capitalist Music journalist”. Alas, the tiny speck of Interwebshire where these words appeared has <strong><a href="http://soundofmoh.blogspot.com/2010/12/capitalist-music.html" class="external">vanished</a></strong>. Let us hope it pops up again somewhere one day.</p>
  <p>Capitalist Music were an endearingly preposterous band, based in Norwich, in those heady post-punk days circa 1979–1982. Their chief characteristic, as I recall, was an almost boundless self-importance. For the crime of having given them a so-so review in a local rag, I earned my immortal epithet. Not “an” anti-Capitalist Music journalist, note, but “the” (as if they were otherwise universally adored), and the implication that my opinion of them was the defining fact about me. I may have been scribbling reviews of other bands, and of films, and bashing out a <strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/salimfadhley/sets/72057594140539554/" class="external">cartoon strip</a></strong>, but what did that matter? Surely everybody knew me as “the anti-Capitalist Music journalist”.</p>
  <p>But was I, truly? After all, here I am writing about them thirty years later. The reason for doing so is basically a plea for help. For me, the band's finest work was the ludicrous “Jane's Gone To France”, with its rousing lines “It's the land of cheese and wine / It's the land of Marshal Petain!” Yet no matter how efficiently I sluice out my ears with Dr Baxter's Ear-Sluicing Preparation, I have never, ever been able to work out what on earth the great Steve Bloch is singing in the next line. So in a desperate attempt to solve this puzzle that has haunted me for three long decades, I am posting the song here. Have a listen, and when you have calmed down sufficiently, and stopped giggling, do let me know what you think that line is.</p>
  <p>Jane's gone to France</p>
  <p>It's the land of cheese and wine</p>
  <p>And it's the land of Marshal Petain</p>
  <p>And it's the land of [<em>what, for God's sake?</em>]</p>
  <p>She was a good girl</p>
  <p>But now she's gone for good</p>
