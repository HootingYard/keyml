  <h1 id="post-9166">Eight / Eight</h1>
  <p class="noindent">For reasons both bewildering and unfathomable, Hooting Yard has occasionally ended up in lists of tiptop blogs perused by those of a Liberal Democrat persuasion. Partly by way of these perplexing bedfellows, I happened upon a postage called <strong><em><a href="http://liberalengland.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/eight-years-in-eight-posts.html" class="external">Eight years in eight posts</a></em></strong>—where Jonathan Calder, following the lead of some others, took a look back at what he was writing on more or less the same date during the past eight years. So I thought it might be instructive and diverting to do the same. There was a time, regrettably, when Hooting Yard was not the Indefatigable Daily it has become, so where there was no postage for 16 May I have taken something from as close to the date as I could.</p>
  <p>Last year, on <strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="Oolississ">16 May 2011</a></strong>, I linked to a piece in <em>The Dabbler</em> about James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>. This gave me the excuse to retail for the umpteenth time a couple of contemporary reviews of the novel and other Joycean bittybobs.</p>
  <p>On <strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Bats Of Remorse">16 May 2010</a></strong>, <em>The Bats Of Remorse</em> included the phrase “the porale of grief”. “Porale” is a splendid and too rarely deployed word.</p>
  <p>On <strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="Four Types Of Reader">18 May 2009</a></strong> I revealed the four categories of reader defined by an eighteenth-century subscription library.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="Proper Tennis">16 May 2008</a></strong> was the occasion for an illustration depicting sphairistike as played in the year 2000.</p>
  <p>Another illustration on <strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="From The Archives">16 May 2007</a></strong>, which I like so much I shall reproduce it here. We have, of course, seen <strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="On The Accidental Death Of A Cartographer&nbsp;: Part Five">further</a></strong> references to <em><strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="On The Sixth Of May 2012">Chutney On My Spats</a></strong></em> in recent <strong><a href="09166_eight_eight.xhtml" class="internal" title="Important Reader's Digest Correspondence">days</a></strong>.</p>

  <p class="noindent">We now revert to the old Hooting Yard format, where <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/may06.htm#2006-05-14" class="hootingyard">14 May 2006</a></strong> included a quotation from <em>Bachelor Bluff&nbsp;: His Opinions, Sentiments, And Disputations</em> by Oliver Bell Bunce (1881).</p>
  <p>On <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/may05.htm#2005-05-24" class="hootingyard">24 May 2005</a></strong>, learn why you will be disappointed should you wish to know How Cats Spend Their Time.</p>
  <p>And on <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/may04.htm#2004-05-17-2" class="hootingyard">17 May 2004</a></strong>, <em>The Life And Loves Of The Immersion Man</em>, one of the first pieces I ever read on Resonance104.4FM, on a Clear Spot programme in 2002, before the advent of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> The links to Old Format Hooting Yard seem to go somewhat astray. You might have to scroll up or down a tad to find precisely what I intend you to find.</p>
