  <h1>World O' Cake</h1>
  <p class="noindent"><em>To be given a Sop.</em> The full quotation should be “to give a sop to Cerberus”. Cerberus was Pluto's three-headed dog set at the gates of the Infernal Regions over which Pluto was King. The Greeks and Romans when burying their dead put into the hands of the corpse a cake. The idea was that the cake was a sop to Cerberus to allow the dead to pass unmolested.</p>
