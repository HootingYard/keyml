  <h1>On Why I Should Be The Next Pope</h1>
  <p class="noindent">So, having previously explained <strong><a href="2012-11-10-on-why-i-should-have-been-the-next-archbishop-of-canterbury.xhtml" class="internal" title="On Why I Should Have Been The Next Archbishop Of Canterbury">why I should have been the next Archbishop of Canterbury</a></strong> and why I was the obvious choice to be <strong><a href="2012-11-12-on-why-i-should-be-the-next-director-general-of-the-bbc.xhtml" class="internal" title="On Why I Should Be The Next Director General Of The BBC">the next Director General of the BBC</a></strong>, I will no doubt be asked to explain why I should be the next Pope. Do I really need to argue my case? Has the world collapsed to the extent that it is even necessary for me to stake my claim? I mean, isn't it blindingly obvious that I would be absolutely the finest Pontiff you could imagine? I shall sit by my metal tapping machine and await the call from the conclave of cardinals, and while I wait I shall give due consideration to the pontifical name I shall adopt. Readers may have their own suggestions of course, which you may wish to note in the comments.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, it appears that these very sensible persons of the Islamic persuasion were correct after all. . .</p>
