  <h1>Thurn's Swoon</h1>
  <p>That grumbling complainant Tim Thurn, who seems to read these pages for no other reason than to find things to whinge about, has sent in another missive:</p>
  <p>Dear Mr Key, <em>he writes,</em> It is little more than a week since you resuscitated Hooting Yard, and in that short time you have written about swans and swains. Do you not think it would be better to leave a gap between such near-homophones, say a month or two? I cannot be your only reader who has failing eyesight and who can thus become confused, when peering at my computer screen, wondering if an item about swains is a continuation of some drivel about swans, or vice versa. Yours tetchily, Tim Thurn</p>
  <p>All I can say in response is that I hope Tim's bedizenment was not so great that in failing to distinguish between swains and swans he fell into a swoon.</p>
