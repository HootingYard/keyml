  <h1>Ono Again</h1>
  <p><em>I would not wish readers to miss a comment posted by Max Décharné on <strong><a href="2017-02-18-84-today.xhtml" class="internal" title="84 Today!">Ms Ono's birthday</a></strong>, so I have yanked it out and place it here for your edification:</em></p>
  <p>Frank, inspired by your call to arms, I immediately wrote and staged a three-hour chirpy Cockney knees-up musical based upon the lives of our two multi-millionaire heroes, entitled “John &amp; Yoko—I Should Coco,” in which the whole cast and audience bring the Grade 2-listed house down with a rousing final chorus of “Yes! Imagine We Have No Bananas, I Wonder If You Can?”</p>
