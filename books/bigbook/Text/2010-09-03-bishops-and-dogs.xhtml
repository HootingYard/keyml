  <h1 id="post-5169">Bishops And Dogs</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It has come to my attention that a bishop, when dying, is compelled by law to bequeath his pack of dogs to the reigning monarch, for the sovereign's free use and disposal.</p>
  <p>Perhaps there is a legal expert among my readers who could confirm whether or no this sensible measure remains on the statute book. And if it does, I would be interested to know if it is possible to pursue, beyond the grave, any bishop who, before his last gasp, broke the law by <em>not</em> so bequeathing his pack of dogs. It seems to me that a prelate who sinned by breaking the law, even in his last extremity, ought to be pitched from his heavenly perch into the maw of hell.</p>
