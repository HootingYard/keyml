  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Another thing I had noticed which gave me an unpleasant qualm—almost a feeling of nausea. At her breast Dorothy Wolff was wearing a weird orange flower covered with hideous black protruding spots, which suggested more than anything else some particularly noxious disease. The beastly thing, fraught with ill omen, irritated my nerves beyond all words.” — Gerald Biss, <em>The Door Of the Unreal</em></p>
