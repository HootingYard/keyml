  <h1>An Exciting New Scheme</h1>
  <p class="noindent">We are pleased to announce an exciting new scheme here at Hooting Yard. In our tireless attempts to keep alive forgotten pockets of our cultural heritage, if pockets can be considered animate, we are introducing Rare Bird Loyalty Cards. That's right! To honour the time when music meant portentous vapidity, aimless noodling, and cod-orchestral shenanigans, you can win points on your Loyalty Card every time you devote part of your listening day to the more ludicrous excesses of prog rock.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The design of the card is based on Rare Bird's <em>Sympathy</em> LP, which may or may not have had a gatefold sleeve originally. Extra points can be awarded if you manage to dredge up memories of significant titles such as <em>Pantagruel's Nativity</em> by the otiose Gentle Giant. To apply for your card, send us an email with the words <em>Atomic Rooster</em> in the subject line.</p>
