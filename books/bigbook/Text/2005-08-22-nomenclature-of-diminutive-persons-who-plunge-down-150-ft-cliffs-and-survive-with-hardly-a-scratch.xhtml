  <h1>Nomenclature of Diminutive Persons Who Plunge Down 150-ft Cliffs and Survive With Hardly a Scratch</h1>
  <p class="noindent">The most recent addition to our list which attempts a complete nomenclature of diminutive persons who survive after toppling over the edge of cliffs is Demi-Leigh Tweddle. The wonderfully-named Ms Tweddle meets the diminutiveness criterion in that she is a six year old child. Last week, she <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4160000/newsid_4165800/4165846.stm">tumbled</a> one hundred and fifty feet down the cliffs at Chimney Hole, near Filey, in North Yorkshire, while playing roly poly. When she reached the bottom, she simply picked herself up and walked around to find her parents.</p>
  <p>Demi-Leigh Tweddle should not be confused with Dairylea Twaddle, which is a generic term for the advertising guff spouted by the makers of foil-wrapped processed cheese triangles and similar produce.</p>
  <p>Rumours that your esteemed editor has changed his name to Demi-Frank Key are inaccurate and can be discounted.</p>
