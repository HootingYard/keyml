  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“She gave him a key to the locker and told him the evening class would start in thirty minutes. ‘Get out of your clothes,’ she directed. 'I'll be back in no time to show you the ropes.' She smiled again, a friendly smile of promise. Ace was new at the nudist racket, but he lost no time removing his clothing. He patted his .38 with a feeling of regret as he stored it away in the locker.” — Jack Gray, <em>The Nudist Gym Death Riddle</em></p>
