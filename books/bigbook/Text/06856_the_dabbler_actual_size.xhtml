  <p class="noindent">Critically important advice, in my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/07/the-neurasthenic-aquaperson/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, on correct apprehension of the dimensions of sea beasties. I claim no credit, as the piece is basically a paraphrase of Pebblehead, from one of his innumerable bestselling paperbacks.</p>
  <p>Over the years, many readers have written to ask if there is any truth in the rumour that, long before <em>Frost/Nixon</em>, there was a project entitled <em>Frost/Pebblehead</em>, or even <em>Pebblehead/Nixon</em>, which had to be abandoned due to pelf and priggishness and panic and other things beginning with P. Many readers have asked, and none has been answered, for I chuck all such enquiries into a waste chute, down which they fall, rolling and tumbling, until they reach the fires of hell, where they burn to a crisp. Some things are better left uninvestigated, unresearched, unsaid.</p>
