  <p class="noindent">It is about time we had a hovel in the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, so here is one that doubles as a Norbiton allotment shed.</p>

  <p class="noindent">I have taken this snap from <strong><a href="http://www.anatomyofnorbiton.org/" class="external">Anatomy Of Norbiton</a></strong>, an extraordinary website and a thing of strange and terrible beauty. If you can bear to tear yourself away from Hooting Yard—never an easy task, I know, but with grit and determination it is occasionally possible—I recommend that you immerse yourself in its wonders for several hours.</p>
