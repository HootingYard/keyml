  <h1 id="post-11761">Schwob On Boswell</h1>
  <p class="noindent">In the introduction to his <em>Les Vies Imaginaires</em> (1896)—a profound influence upon Borges—Marcel Schwob writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">If Boswell's book took up ten pages it would be the book we were looking for. Doctor Johnson's common sense comprises the vulgarest of commonplaces: expressed with the bizarre violence that Boswell has the art to depict, it has a quality unique in this world. Only this ponderous catalogue resembles the doctor's dictionary; from it one could extract a <em>Scientia Johnsoniana</em> with an index. Boswell has not had the aesthetic courage to select.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">(Translation by Iain White.)</p>
  <p>I was delighted to note, elsewhere in the introduction, that Schwob makes mention of “the conjectures to which Boswell abandons us concerning the use Johnson made of the dried orange-peel he liked to keep in his pockets”—as noted recently <strong><a href="2013-07-20-schwob-on-boswell.xhtml" class="internal" title="Dabbling With Oranges">here</a></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>NB&nbsp;:</strong> Hooting Yard's in-house anagrammatist R. will, I hope, get to work on the title of this postage.</p>
