  <h1 id="post-439">Donations</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I want to take this opportunity to thank those readers and listeners who click that rectangular orange emblem over to the right and make donations to Hooting Yard via Paypal. There aren't that many of you, and you know who you are, and you should be aware that your donations are genuinely appreciated. They do actually help me to meet such essential costs as my gas bill or bus fares.</p>
  <p>If you haven't yet donated, and enjoy the teeming thousands of words here or the countless hours of podcast audio of me babbling into a microphone, please consider doing so. If nothing else, you will get your reward in heaven, or in hell via a handcart, depending upon your moral probity.</p>
