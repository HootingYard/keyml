  <p class="noindent">Blasphemous Ted Cargpan's dog (above) has been awarded top prize in the “Ayn Rand Household Pet Of The Week” contest run by <em>The Weekly Shackle.</em> The hound, variously known as Hopscotch, Spinach, Chevenix De Groot, and L'Oreal (because he's worth it) was the clear winner in a field which included a bee, a horse, three corncrakes, a flea-ridden bison, Tim the pipistrelle bat, a weasel, a curlew, a pair of otters, and—the bookies' favourite—a squirrel called Miriam. Unfortunately, Miriam succumbed to an attack of the bindings and had to be withdrawn from competition. Better luck next week!</p>
