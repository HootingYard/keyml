  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“His commands to the labourers were substantially these: ‘Take your mattocks, and pick up that stone flooring; then take your basket, and fill it with the bones of hyaenas and other creatures which you will find there.’ We may fancy the ridicule wherewith ignorance might have greeted science: but lo, the triumph of philosophy, when its mandate soon assumed a bodily shape in bushels of bones gnawed as by wild beasts, and here and there a grinning skull that looked like a hyaena's!” — Martin Farquhar Tupper, <em>Probabilities</em></p>
