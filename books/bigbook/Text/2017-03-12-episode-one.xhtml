  <p class="noindent">Prick up your ears and click <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-9th-march-2017/" class="external">here</a></strong> and you can listen to the first episode of <em>Hooting Yard In The Electro-Magnetic Field</em>, a brand new show from ResonanceFM.</p>
  <p>As I write, boffins in a top secret research laboratory buried somewhere beneath the Swiss Alps are trying to calculate just how this show can be differentiated from the much-loved <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>. Initial measurements would seem to indicate the answer is “not at all”.</p>
