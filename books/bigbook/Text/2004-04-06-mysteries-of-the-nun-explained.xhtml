Back at the convent, perched dangerously on the edge of the Dizzyingly High Cliffs of Ümblasco, she was the subject of much impromptu doggerel. <em>That Sister Hortense / She makes no sense / Mother Superior / Said “Get thee hence!”</em> sang the novitiates as they queued in the canteen for their jugged hare and creeping jenny.

He took her away with him to sea, and she followed willingly, and when he fell overboard after an accident with a topgallant shroud as the ship approached the Arctic Circle, she gave not one whit of a thought to returning to the convent. She prayed; she said her novenas; she drank rainwater; and two weeks later she hove into port, who knows what port it was, gave the barquentine a lick of paint, stocked up on provisions, renamed the boat the <em>SS Our Lady of Lachrymose Convulsions</em>, and sailed away. Auks and skuas shrieked, and a guillemot swooped low over the poop deck.
