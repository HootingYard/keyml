  <p class="noindent">B is for Bat, and for our entry on Bats who better to quote than the preposterous, ridiculous Aleister Crowley? This is from “The Cry of the 18th Aethyr which is called Zen”, from <em>The Vision And The Voice</em> (written in 1909, as far as I know, or care).</p>
  <p>“And now there dawns the scene of the Crucifixion ; but the Crucified One is an enormous bat, and for the two thieves are two little children. It is night, and the night is full of hideous things and howlings.”</p>
