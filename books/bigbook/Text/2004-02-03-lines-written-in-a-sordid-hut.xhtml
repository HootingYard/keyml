  <h1>Lines Written in a Sordid Hut</h1>
  <p>The dilapidated walls, the mouldering plaster, the blackened mantel-pieces, the stained and polluted wainscots—under license of a fop! Wrath, wrath immeasurable, unimaginable, unmitigable, burned at my heart like a cancer; the worst had come, among weeds and forgetfulness, the blank treachery of hollowness. A pageant of vapory exhalations; thick clouds and vapours. Hoist by the fop's petard, I could but drool.</p>
