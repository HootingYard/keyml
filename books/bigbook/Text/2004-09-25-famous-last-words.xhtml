  <h1>Famous Last Words</h1>
  <p class="noindent">This afternoon, whim dictates that I share with readers some famous last words.</p>
  <p>“Reynolds! Reynolds! … Reynolds!” — Edgar Allan Poe <span class="asterisk">*</span></p>
  <p>“I suppose I am now becoming a god” — Emperor Vespasian</p>
  <p>“All this buttoning and unbuttoning” — Anonymous 17th century suicide</p>
  <p>“It was I who discovered leeches have red blood.” Georges Cuvier</p>
  <p class="footnote"><span class="mark">* NOTE&nbsp;:</span> Poe was yelling out for Jeremiah Reynolds—not present at his deathbed—an enthusiastic supporter of the hollow earth theories of <a class="external" href="http://www.burlingtonnews.net/judithhedden2.html">John Cleve Symmes</a>. Symmes' idea that there were entrances to subterranean worlds at both the Poles was one of the inspirations for Poe's magnificent <em>The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket</em>.</p>

    <p class="caption">Symmes&nbsp;: “I declare the earth is hollow, and inhabital within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the poles or 16 degrees; I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow, if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking.”</p>
