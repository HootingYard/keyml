  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“An Estonian friend who came here as a displaced person in the 1940s told me that she did not know what kind of country she had arrived in as she landed in Hull, which means ‘mad’ in Estonian, with the head of state being the king, Estonian for ‘shoe’. Not only Brits find other people's languages funny.” — J Terry Palmer, <em>Letter to the Guardian, today</em></p>
