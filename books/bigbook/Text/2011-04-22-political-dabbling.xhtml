    <p class="caption">In <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/04/sir-isaac-newton-m-p/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week I examine in breathtaking detail the parliamentary career of a scientist who dabbled in politics. Dabbler he may have been, but Sir Isaac Newton's record as a parliamentarian, albeit brief, was exemplary, and ought to serve as a model for some of the more loathsome specimens at large in the Palace of Westminster today.</p>
