  <h1 id="post-11695">Riddled With Knowledge</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Mary Bousted, leader of one of the teachers' unions, was on the radio the other day giving her views on the planned new national curriculum. Obviously she disapproved of it, because the teachers' unions automatically disapprove of any and all revisions suggested by the government, whichever government is in power. What was striking, however, was one of her principal objections. The new curriculum, she warned darkly, is “riddled with knowledge”.</p>
  <p>Heaven forfend that the teachers in our <del>schools</del> self-esteem ‘n’ diversity awareness hubs should be expected to impart <em>knowledge</em> to the tinies!</p>
  <p>I am left speechless, but will merely note that Mary Bousted attended a grammar school and bears the title of “Doctor”. I think she must have been taught some “knowledge” somewhere along the line.</p>
