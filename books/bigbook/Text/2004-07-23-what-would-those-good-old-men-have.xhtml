  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“What would those good old men have thought when they were laughing at and ridiculing Mr. Terry, if they had known that the little urchin who was so eagerly listening to their conversation would live to make <em>Two Hundred Thousand</em> metal clocks in one year, and <em>many millions</em> in his life. They have probably been dead for years, that little boy is now an old man.” — Chauncey Jerome, <em>History Of The American Clock Business For The Past Sixty Years</em></p>
