  <h1 id="post-6504">An Easter Sunday Morning Moan</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Prompted by his recent piece in <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/03/tim-birkhead-on-the-wisdom-of-birds/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></strong>, I decided to improve my ornithological knowledge by reading Tim Birkhead's <em>The Wisdom Of Birds</em>. And lo! that is how I began my Easter Sunday on this sunny morning, to the sound of cawing crows outside.</p>

  <p class="noindent">I am afraid to say I am ready to hurl the book across the room in exasperation. This is an expensive and lavishly-produced Bloomsbury book, and by page 18 I have fought my way past no fewer than three howling typos: a missing indefinite article on page 2, “who” for “how” on page 6, and “know” for “known” on page 18. This is proofreading-by-spellcheck, and it simply isn't good enough.</p>
  <p>I shall persevere, for the time being. But this slipshod approach fatally undermines the pleasure of reading, for me. Tim Birkhead has been ill-served by his publishers. I'd insist on getting the whole print-run pulped and starting again, with a competent copy editor.</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> Still on page 18, and another one!—“principle” where what is meant is “principal”.</p>
