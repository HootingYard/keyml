  <p>“Q.- What is Cabrey's arrangement? A.- Mr. Cabrey makes his eccentric rod terminate in a pin which works into a straight slotted lever, furnished with jaws similar to the jaws on the eccentric rods of locomotives. By raising the pin of the eccentric rod in this slot, the travel of the valve will be varied, and expansive action will be the result. Q.- What other forms of apparatus are there for working steam expansively? A.- They are too numerous for description here, but a few of them may be enumerated. Fenton seeks to accomplish the desired object by introducing a spiral feather on the crank axle…” — John Bourne, <em>A Catechism Of The Steam Engine</em></p>
