  <h1>Boffins' Work Done</h1>
  <p>The boffins have now completed their <strong><a href="2009-07-25-boffins-at-work.xhtml" class="internal" title="Boffins At Work">work</a></strong>, and so exquisite has it been that you lot won't even know anything has happened. But, by the long grey beard of Methuselah, it has! New Hooting Yard may look identical to old, tired, dull, pasty-faced Hooting Yard, but it is revivified and a-throb. Steam was pouring out of the funnels late into the night. I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
  <p>Actually, a couple of vague traces of the boffins' work are apparent. The three postages from yesterday have had to be reposted, and I have added the original date in the interests of fanatical and pointless accuracy. Also, any comments made on those postages have vanished into the murk, so I would ask readers who spent hours crafting their pearls of wisdom to type them out again and repost them.</p>
  <p>It is at times like this we all ought to whistle along to <em>Time, forward!</em> by Gyorgy Sviridov (1915â€“1998)</p>
