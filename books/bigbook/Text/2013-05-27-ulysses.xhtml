  <h1 id="post-11479">Ulysses</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Clench your fist in such a way that, when held up against a beam of light and casting its shadow upon the wall, it resembles, in silhouette, a stately, plump person. Why, as I live and breathe, 'tis Buck Mulligan!</p>

  <p><strong>ADDENDUM&nbsp;:</strong> You hardly need reminding that Joyce himself always pronounced the title of his book <em>Oo-liss-iss</em>.</p>
