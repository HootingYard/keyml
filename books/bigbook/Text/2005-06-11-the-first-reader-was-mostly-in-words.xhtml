  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The First Reader was mostly in words of one syllable. In this book we find the story of the lame dog that, when cured, brought another lame dog to be doctored; of the kind boy who freed his caged bird; of the cruel boy who drowned the cat and pulled wings and legs from flies;… of the chimney sweep who was tempted to steal a gold watch but put it back and was thereafter educated by its owner; of the whisky boy; and of the mischievous boy who played ghost and made another boy insane. Nearly every lesson has a moral clearly stated in formal didactic words at its close.” — Henry H Vail, <em>A History Of The McGuffey Readers</em></p>
