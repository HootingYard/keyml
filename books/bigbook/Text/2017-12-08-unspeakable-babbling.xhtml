  <p class="noindent">In this week's <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-7th-december-2017/" class="external"><strong>episode</strong></a> of your favourite radio programme, Mr Key discusses the cravat of an <a href="2017-12-08-unspeakable-babbling.xhtml" class="internal" title="Unspeakable"><strong>unspeakable</strong></a> cad, a village full of <a href="2017-12-08-unspeakable-babbling.xhtml" class="internal" title="Guy Maddin Film Intertitles Advent Calendarâ€”VI"><strong>cheesegraters</strong></a>, birds and <a href="2017-12-08-unspeakable-babbling.xhtml" class="internal" title="Birds And Bats And The Bible And The BBC"><strong>bats</strong></a> and the Bible and the BBC, and, last but not least, <a href="2017-12-08-unspeakable-babbling.xhtml" class="internal" title="Lint"><strong>lint</strong></a>, with particular reference to some godawful power ballads.</p>
