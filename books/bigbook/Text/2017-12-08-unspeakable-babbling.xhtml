  <p>In this week's <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-7th-december-2017/" class="external"><strong>episode</strong></a> of your favourite radio programme, Mr Key discusses the cravat of an <a href="2017-10-08-unspeakable.xhtml" class="internal" title="Unspeakable"><strong>unspeakable</strong></a> cad, a village full of <a href="2017-12-06-guy-maddin-film-intertitles-advent-calendar-vi.xhtml" class="internal" title="Guy Maddin Film Intertitles Advent Calendarâ€”VI"><strong>cheesegraters</strong></a>, birds and <a href="2017-10-31-birds-and-bats-and-the-bible-and-the-bbc.xhtml" class="internal" title="Birds And Bats And The Bible And The BBC"><strong>bats</strong></a> and the Bible and the BBC, and, last but not least, <a href="2017-11-01-lint.xhtml" class="internal" title="Lint"><strong>lint</strong></a>, with particular reference to some godawful power ballads.</p>
  <p>As if that were not enough to have you swooning with unalloyed ear-pleasure, the show features the return of Miss Blossom Partridge and her knitting tips. Is there, or has there ever been, anything on the radio to compare with the sheer moral heft of this programme?</p>
