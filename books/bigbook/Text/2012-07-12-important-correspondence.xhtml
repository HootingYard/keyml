  <p>An important letter arrives from Antipodean Hooting Yard researcher Glyn Webster. The heading is “Supermarket”. I reproduce it in its entirety:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The elderly man ahead of me was buying a big bag of zeolite, two bottles of Shiraz and a funnel. And I said nothing! Lord knows what he has gone and done.</p>
