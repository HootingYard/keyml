  <h1 id="post-2327">Shepperton And Hampstead</h1>
  <p>I haven't read anything by J G Ballard since I was a teenager. Nor have I read, or enjoyed, much science fiction. A simple statement by Ballard, filmed in 2006 and shown on a Channel Four News obituary last night, makes me suspect I've been missing something. He said:</p>
  <p>“The great thing about science fiction is that nobody lives in Hampstead.”</p>
  <p>Compare and contrast with this extract from a book review by some airhead a few years ago, which I shall have to paraphrase because I cannot track down the exact quote:</p>
  <p>“This is a perfectly-observed portrait of North London literary life, with such telling details as the copy of the weekend <em>Guardian Guide</em> on the coffee table.”</p>
  <p>I don't recall which novel was under review, but it could have been one among hundreds, couldn't it?</p>
