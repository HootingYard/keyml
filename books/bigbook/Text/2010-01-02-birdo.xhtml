  <h1>Birdo</h1>
  <p class="noindent">At the risk of deluging you with <strong><a href="2010-01-02-a-pernicious-brain-softener.xhtml" class="internal" title="A Pernicious Brain-Softener">Heppenstall</a></strong>, I cannot resist posting this line from <em>The Intellectual Part</em>:</p>
  <p>“I had never thought highly of Esperanto (my father had once tried to make me learn it, but when I found the word for bird was ‘birdo’ I could no longer take it seriously).”</p>
  <p>I wonder if perhaps I should arrange for Blötzmann's <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/mar06.htm#2006-03-11-1" class="hootingyard">bird psychology diagram</a></strong> to be translated into a <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/mar06.htm#2006-03-13-1" class="hootingyard">birdo psychologyo diagramo</a></strong>.</p>
