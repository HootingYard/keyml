  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Athwart that dream came a sudden, frightful, heart-stilling roar of destruction; a hideous crash followed, a terrible rending, breaking, smashing, concatenation of noises, succeeded by frightful detonations… the ship was reduced in a few moments to a disjointed, disorganized, sinking mass of shapeless, formless, splintered steel.” — Cyrus Townsend Brady, <em>And Thus He Came</em></p>
