  <h1>In Re Joyce</h1>
  <p>The Irish writer Roddy Doyle recently turned his piercing critical pea-shooter upon Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>, accusing it, among other things, of being overlong and in need of a good editor. Mr Doyle, if you are going to criticise a book, at least do the job properly! Here are two excerpts from contemporary reviews of the great work:</p>
  <p>“An immense mass of clotted nonsense” — <em>Teachers' World</em></p>
  <p>“The maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book issued in our own or any other time… inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty … a book that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum” — <em>The Sphere</em></p>
