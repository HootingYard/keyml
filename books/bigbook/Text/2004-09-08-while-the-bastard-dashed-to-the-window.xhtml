  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“While the Bastard dashed to the window, the barber considerately helped little Blanche to her feet; and since Blanche d'Ovrebreuc, Vicomtesse d'Acy, was a religious soul, she wiped her mouth and her husband's face with her Picardy hood, placed it over his swollen face, and recited in her childish voice three Our Fathers and one Hail Mary, amid the yelling of the Bastard's men, who were busy ransacking the coffers.” — Marcel Schwob, <em>Bloody Blanche</em></p>
