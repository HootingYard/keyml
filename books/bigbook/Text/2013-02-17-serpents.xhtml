  <blockquote>
    <p>Emmett lived in a trailer park out by the airport. I took a back road and ran over a dead snake on the way. Louise turned to me. “You just drove right over that snake.”</p>
    <p>“That was an old broken fan belt.”</p>
    <p>“It was white on the bottom. Do you think I don't know a snake when I see one?”</p>
    <p>I told her he was already dead and that women were easily taken in by serpents.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Charles Portis, <em>Gringos</em> (1991)</p>
