  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Found wandering in a confused state in Crucifix Lane, near his cathedral… the Rt Rev Tom Butler… was seen sitting in the back of a Mercedes chucking children's toys out of the window and announcing: ‘I'm the Bishop of Southwark. It's what I do.’” — <em>The Guardian</em>, today</p>
