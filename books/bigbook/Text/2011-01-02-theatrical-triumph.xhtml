  <p>We do not pay much attention to the theatrical world here at Hooting Yard, unless, that is, we have tidings to report from the Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre. But every so often, a dramatic production so stupendous comes along that we can but gasp in awe and admiration.</p>

  <p>Such a theatrical triumph is <em>Entries From Reverend Gilbert White's Diary In December</em>, performed by Miss Hathorn's Little Paper Theatre at <strong><em><a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2011/01/natural-history-of-selbourne-musical.html" class="external">Mustard Plaster</a></em></strong>. If there was a smidgen of sense in the world, this would transfer to the West End and pack in the punters and be showered with awards.</p>

  <p>Readers are reminded that the Hooting Yard Christmas Special for 2009, devoted to Mrs Snooke's tortoise Timothy (pictured above), can still be listened to <strong><a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/1577" class="external">here</a></strong>.</p>
