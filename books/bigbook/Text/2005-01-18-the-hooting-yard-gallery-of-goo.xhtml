  <h1>The Hooting Yard Gallery of Goo</h1>
  <p>Having read the above item, would you like to experience the world through a film of ectoplasmic goo? One way to begin is to do as Minnie Harrison did. She is shown here, in Middlesbrough in December 1948, creating her own extrusion of ectoplasm.</p>

    <p class="caption">Ectoplasm emanating from the Medium's mouth. Taken in complete darkness using Kodak infra-red plate. Exposure by means of powerful ‘Sashalight’ bulb through ‘Wratten’ glass filter—extremely deep ruby-red colour. The Ectoplasm is emanating from her mouth and in this form it is quite transparent, very similar in appearance and texture to chiffon.
