  <h1 id="post-16291">In Gath</h1>
  <p class="noindent">And lo! there came unto Gath an man whose head was as the head of the otter.</p>
  <p>And his body also was as the form of the otter and likewise his dimension.</p>
  <p>And when the man spoke his voice was as the cry of the otter.</p>
  <p>Now the people of Gath, seeing this, were much afraid.</p>
  <p>They gathered about the man with their pointy sticks and led him unto their Hierophant.</p>
  <p>Now the Hierophant of Gath dwelt in a place of much mist and vapourousness unyielding.</p>
  <p>And the people said “O Hierophant of Gath, we bring you this man in form like unto the otter, what shall we do with him?”</p>
  <p>And with his mouth the Hierophant of Gath spoke mumbo-jumbo unto them and they laid down their pointy sticks and returned to their fathers' fields where many tares were sown.</p>
  <p>And he took the man like unto the otter into his house in the mists.</p>
  <p>And the next day there came tidings of the <em>Hindenburg</em> disaster.</p>
