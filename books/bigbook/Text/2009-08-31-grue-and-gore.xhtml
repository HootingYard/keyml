  <h1>Grue And Gore</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I had never before visited <strong><a href="http://assemblyman-eph.blogspot.com/" class="external">ephemera assemblyman</a></strong>, but I am glad I did, and you will be too.</p>

  <p class="noindent">I particularly enjoyed <strong><a href="http://assemblyman-eph.blogspot.com/2009/04/dying-speeches-execution-broadsides.html" class="external">Dying Speeches Execution Broadsides</a></strong>, which contains much that is gruesome, in a chronologically distant, non-threatening way. Oddly, no mention is made of the killer <strong><a href="2009-01-24-chucking-out-time-at-the-cow-and-pins.xhtml" class="internal" title="Chucking-Out Time At The Cow &amp; Pins">Babinsky</a></strong>, whose gore-splattered end would make some of the scenes depicted look more like the twee adventures of Pippy The Pit Pony. I shall transcribe an account of Babinsky's doom here shortly, when I can face typing up the details without emptying my guts all over the place.</p>
