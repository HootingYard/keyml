  <h1 id="post-12662">American Vicarage</h1>
  <p class="noindent">In his scholarly introduction to <em><strong><a href="12662_american_vicarage.xhtml" class="internal" title="Baffling, Brilliant, Brutal, &amp; Hysterically Funny">By Aerostat To Hooting Yard</a></strong></em>, Roland Clare writes: “<em>The Bad Vicarage</em> is a very funny piece that epitomises not only the moral instability of Hooting Yard but also Key's desire to puncture the very illusion of reality that naturalistic authors are at pains to sustain. Even if the rest of the story were sensible—rest assured, it is not—there is no easy way we can come to terms with the unreliability of a narrator who first wonders what has become of the ‘Bad Vicar’, then reveals himself to be the incumbent in question.”</p>
  <p>The estimable Walt O'Hara of <em>Airy Persiflage</em> says: “Not for the faint of heart, Mr. Key's spine tingling tale of a monstrous vicar of old and the evil that he wrought!” You can enjoy the pleasurably disconcerting experience of listening to the tale read by Mr O'Hara <strong><a href="http://misternizz.podbean.com/2014/04/14/on-the-bad-vicarage-by-mr-frank-key-read-by-walt-ohara/?token=7d93bb94ed9a129016a19f709fab4a59" class="external">here</a></strong>.</p>
