  <h1 id="post-6308">For Podpersons</h1>
  <p>In a startling initiative, born of who knows what brain-faff, I have resolved to post a direct link here each time a new Hooting Yard On The Air podcast is made available by ResonanceFM's podcasting maestro. So here is the latest:</p>
  <p class="centered"><strong><a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/6468" class="external">On Sawdust Bridge, Harangued</a></strong> Click, listen, and learn.</p>

  <p>In a couple of weeks' time, the show will celebrate its seventh anniversary. It is a pity, I think, that back in 2004 neither I nor anyone else thought to apply Blötzmann numbers to the episodes. Scholars, researchers, and fools would have a much easier time of it if they were able to refer to “Episode 149”, say, instead of having to identify shows by the original broadcast date. Perhaps a sensible person could devote a portion of their otherwise worthless life to the creation of a numerical index?</p>
