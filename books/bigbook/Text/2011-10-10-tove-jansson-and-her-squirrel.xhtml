  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Max said, “Don't you ever feel inspired to paint the Finnish countryside in summer?”</p>
    <p>“It's all so damned green,” she answered.</p>
    <p>Then she told us about the squirrel, the one squirrel which has appeared on the island; and it slept under her neck and tried to collect food there. As the relationship between artist and squirrel developed, the squirrel came to expect a game at four o’ clock in the morning. Tove Jansson had to get out of bed and pretend to be a tree. The squirrel would run up and down her frozen limbs.</p>
