  <h1 id="post-6729">The Lobster's Tune</h1>
  <p>In Act III, Scene III of <em>Death's Jest-Book, or The Fool's Tragedy</em> by Thomas Lovell Beddoes (1829), Isbrand asks an important question:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What is the lobster's tune when he is boiled?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Alas, he does not answer it, but goes on to sing a song about an unborn ghost, a Nile crocodile, and a “little, gruntless, fairy hog”. This is all very well, but I still want to know about the lobster's tune. Can any reader point me in the right direction? Are there any contemporary cover versions?</p>
