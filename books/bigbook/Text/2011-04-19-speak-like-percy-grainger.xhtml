  <p>Now you too can speak and write like Percy Grainger! At <strong><em><a href="http://strangeflowers.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/a-percy-grainger-glossary/" class="external">Strange Flowers</a></em></strong>, which I am extremely pleased to have discovered, James Conway provides a splendid list of Grainger-approved words. He explains:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>… the older he got the more cantankerous he became. A 1958 piece entitled “The Things I Dislike” began “Almost everything. First of all foreigners, which means: all Europeans except the British, the Scandinavians &amp; the Dutch.”</p>
    <p>Grainger was nothing if not thorough, and his distrust of anything originating south of Holland led to him to try and purge his writing of Greco-Latin elements</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is much more in the piece about the madcap Antipodean composer, but the highlight is the glossary itself. Go thou <strong><a href="http://strangeflowers.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/a-percy-grainger-glossary/" class="external">hence</a></strong> and memorise it, and soon you will be able to write vast epic poems akin to those of <strong><a href="2009-07-13-gurgles-from-hid-grot.xhtml" class="internal" title="Gurgles From Hid Grot">Charles Montague Doughty</a></strong>, surely Grainger's guiding spirit?</p>
