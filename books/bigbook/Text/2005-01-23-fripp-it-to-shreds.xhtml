  <h1>Fripp It to Shreds</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Following our heartfelt homage to King Crimson maestro and über-cranium Robert Fripp (see below, 16th January), my old mucker Max Décharné writes with exciting news:</p>
  <p>“Thought you might enjoy <a class="external" href="http://www.fripp.com/frippicism.shtml">this link</a> to the barking mad website of Fripp's sister, who seems to be a Californian motivational business speaker. Nice to see the relatives of famous people playing down their connections and being all modest. Dig them Frippicisms, dad!”</p>
  <p>Thanks, Max. Visit the site and you too can be the lucky purchaser of a six-CD set (yes, six) of Mr Toyah Wilcox speaking for hours and hours. “Intimate conversations with Robert Fripp produced by Patricia Fripp”, we are told, “For the first time ever… experience the private side of Robert Fripp. Hear him be profound, poignant and up-close-and-personal. When Patricia Fripp is not promoting her brother she is building leaders, transforming sales teams and working as a speech coach to executives.” I wonder if her motivational techniques include forcing the gullible saps to listen to <em>Larks' Tongues In Aspic</em>?</p>
