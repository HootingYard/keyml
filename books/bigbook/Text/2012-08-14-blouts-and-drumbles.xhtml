  <h1>Blouts And Drumbles</h1>
  <p>Having listed some of the <strong><a href="2012-08-14-fubbed-pannicles.xhtml" class="internal" title="Fubbed Pannicles">“heady confect”</a></strong> of words revived in his poetry by Wallace Stevens, Roger Kimball turns to W H Auden and finds</p>

    <p>Auden often remarked on his fondness for the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. In later life, it provided some of his favourite reading matter and indeed was the source of many of the lexical curiosities that—increasingly—bedizened his poetry . . . In a review of <em>Epistle To A Godson</em> (1972), one critic lists “blouts, pirries, stolchy, glunch, sloomy, snudge, snoachy, scaddle, cagmag, hoasting, drumbles”, among others. How many do you know?</p>
