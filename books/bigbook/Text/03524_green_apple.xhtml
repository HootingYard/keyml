  <h1 id="post-3524">Green Apple</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Green Apple Books on Clement Street in San Francisco had been recommended to me as one of the finest bookshops it would ever be my pleasure to visit. As it happened, I was staying five minutes’ walk away, so I availed myself of a number of opportunities to pop my head in the door. They sell both new and used books, and we all know that a splendid selection of reasonably-priced secondhand books is basically what makes life worth living. Here is a list of my purchases, carted back to Blighty to take their places on the tottering bookshelves at Haemoglobin Towers. In no particular order:</p>
  <p><em>H L Mencken&nbsp;: Disturber Of The Peace</em> by William Manchester</p>
  <p><em>Sartor Resartus</em> by Thomas Carlyle</p>
  <p><em>The Post-Office Girl</em> by Stefan Zweig</p>
  <p><em>Lolly Willowes</em> by Sylvia Townsend Warner</p>
  <p><em>The Coming Race</em> by Edward Bulwer-Lytton</p>
  <p><em>The Sinking Of The Odradek Stadium</em> by Harry Mathews</p>
  <p><em>The Case Of The Persevering Maltese&nbsp;: Collected Essays</em> by Harry Mathews</p>
  <p><em>Schnitzler's Century&nbsp;: The Making Of Middle-Class Culture 1815–1914</em> by Peter Gay</p>
  <p><em>Treatise On The Gods</em> by H L Mencken</p>
  <p><em>The Sardonic Humour Of Ambrose Bierce</em> edited by George Barkin</p>
  <p><em>Lost Prince&nbsp;: The Unsolved Mystery Of Kaspar Hauser</em> by Jeffrey Masson</p>
