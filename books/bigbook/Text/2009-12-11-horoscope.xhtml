  <h1 id="post-3527">Horoscope</h1>
  <p>The following forecast is applicable to all twelve astrological signs, and also to three or four of the far more reliable signs in the <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/aug04.htm#2004-08-18-2" class="hootingyard">Blodgett Zodiac</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>“You are followed by an obbligato of hoots and grimaces from a derisive posse of ragamuffins.”</p>
  <p>This prediction first appeared in <em>Wanderings Of A Globe-Trotter In The Far East</em> by Lewis Wingfield, published in 1889. One hundred and twenty years later, it shall come to pass.</p>
