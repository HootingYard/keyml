  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“There is no reason why he should never look chic; he has a slimmer figure than the bullfinch, for instance, who always manages to look so well-tailored. It is just arrogance, pure Londonism, on the part of the sparrow, just that impudent socialistic spirit that makes it so difficult for us to reform the Naughty Poor.” — Stella Benson, <em>Living Alone</em></p>
