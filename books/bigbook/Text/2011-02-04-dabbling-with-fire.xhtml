  <p>In my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/02/keys-cupboard-firestarters/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week, you will be able to discover the causes of thousands of mid-nineteenth-century fires in an unnamed bailiwick served by “the Brigade”. Prometheus was never so busy a bee, nor so inventive. Salutary warnings are implicit in this list, and I recommend you keep a watchful eye on your monkey, your monkey's nuts, your cargo of lime, your sewing, your rats and your ants.</p>
