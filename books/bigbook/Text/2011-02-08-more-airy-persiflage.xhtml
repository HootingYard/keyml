  <h1>More Airy Persiflage</h1>
  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://misternizz.podbean.com/2011/02/04/i-had-a-hammer-by-frank-key/" class="external">Airy Persiflage</a></em></strong>, Walter O'Hara—known to his friends as Mister Nizz—gives a fine rendition of “I Had A Hammer”. I am very fond of the grain of his voice, which has the curious quality of making me believe every word of what he tells me. There is also a pleasingly ramshackle air to his podcast, as if he has simply plopped himself down in front of a microphone for a few minutes in between feeding the hens or fixing the roof. (I should make it plain here that I am wholly unacquainted with Mr O'Hara and have no idea how he spends his days.)</p>
