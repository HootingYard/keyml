  <p class="noindent">Many thanks to <strong><a href="http://davidthompson.typepad.com/davidthompson/2015/02/they-walk-among-us.html" class="external">David Thompson</a></strong> for bringing to our attention this letter from the correspondence columns of the <em>Weekly Worker</em>. What a relief to know that David Icke's sensible insights have been taken on board by the Communist Party Alliance!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">I never claimed that the future of humanity “may rest on the beneficence of extra-terrestrial reptiles.” I… referred to the reptilian control theory, which argues that for thousands of years humanity has been controlled by a reptilian race, using their mixed reptile-human genetic bloodlines, who have oppressed and exploited humans, while claiming descent from the ‘gods' and the divine right to rule by bloodline. Ancient and modern society is obsessed with reptilian, serpent and dragon themes, possibly due to this heritage. Even the flag of Wales has a dragon on it.</p>
    <p>Most people have closed minds, depending on the issues. Mention the possibility of aliens secretly manipulating humanity behind the scenes and the shutters come down.</p>
