  <p>In my cupboard in yesterday's <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2015/07/the-golden-age-of-variety/" class="external">Dabbler</a></em></strong> I resurrected some prose from the last century. The twelve potted biographies you will find there served originally as the texts accompanying illustrations for the 1993 Hooting Yard Calendar, entitled <em>The Golden Age Of Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre</em>. (One of the illustrations is reproduced for The Dabbler.)</p>
  <p>I revisited some even earlier prose in a dream last night. When I was about fifteen years old I wrote a dreadful surrealist(ish) play-of-sorts called <em>The Shepherd Of Amsterdam</em>. The text no longer survives, long ago consumed by fire or eaten by worms. Last night it returned to haunt me in my sleep. I was in charge of putting on a stage production of the work, due to begin in fifteen minutes in spite of the fact that no rehearsals had taken place and the actors were wholly unfamiliar with the play. Indeed, there was only the single copy of the text in my possession, which I belatedly thought to photocopy. I was heading to the library for that purpose when I was told that the soundtrack CD of the play—produced by a walrus-moustachioed impresario who, I was assured, was “a big fan of Hooting Yard”—featuring music by Verdi and Monteverdi, was ready, awaiting only the addition of the actors performing the words.</p>
  <p>Then I woke up.</p>
