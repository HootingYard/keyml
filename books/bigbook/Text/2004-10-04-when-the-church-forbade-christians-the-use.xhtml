  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“When the Church forbade Christians the use of poultry on fast days, it made an exception, out of consideration for the ancient prejudice, in favour of teal, widgeon, moorhens, and also two or three kinds of small amphibious quadrupeds. Hence probably arose the general and absurd beliefs concerning the origin of teal, which some said sprung from the rotten wood of old ships, others from the fruits of a tree, or the gum on fir-trees, whilst others thought they came from a fresh-water shell analogous to that of the oyster and mussel.” — Paul Lacroix, <em>Manners, Customs And Dress During The Middle Ages And During The Renaissance Period</em></p>
