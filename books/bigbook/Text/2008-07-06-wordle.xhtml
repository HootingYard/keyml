  <p>I have just created a <a href="http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/54532/Hooting_Yard_June_2008" class="external"><strong>Wordle</strong></a>. As far as I can see, it's based on the most recent Hooting Yard entries, rather than all of them, which is what I would have preferred. And yet it is still a thing of beauty, I think.</p>
  <p>If I had more skill in technical jiggery-pokery, I would have copied the image and posted it here to save you following the link, but it didn't seem to lend itself to standard copying and pasting. Perhaps I can rely on the helpful nature of a technobod reader to tell me how to do that, and also to tell me if it's possible to do a Wordle of all of Hooting Yard, rather than just some of it.</p>
  <p>N.B.â€”There is a second one <a href="http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/54567/Hooting_Yard_June_2008_(a)" class="external"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
