  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“As I searched feebly among the unmaterial transparencies that were growing more and more evanescent, I saw the symbol of the little shabby figure from the road, staring in at the window. Amid a turmoil of strange gyrations, I caught a sight of him in that zinc box, huddled knees to chin like a prehistoric corpse—there was yet enough water left to cover him. Afterwards I floated for unrealised years in immensity.” — J D Beresford, <em>Nineteen Impressions</em></p>
