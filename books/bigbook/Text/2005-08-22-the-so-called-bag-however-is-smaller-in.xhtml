  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The so-called bag, however, is smaller in width, manufactured of flexible lumalloy which is proof against storm, lightning, and, in fact, everything except explosives… The gas is used as fuel, eliminating all sound save for a faint hissing… We have utilized the gas in small quantities within the ship. The controls, the hatches and elevator, and the disappearing guns, or rather their carriages, are automatically operated. The X-Gas may be released upon our foes with dreadful results. It causes a thin, yellowing, impenetrable haze and, contrary to ordinary principles, does not rise!” — Cyril Plunkett, <em>The X Gas</em></p>
