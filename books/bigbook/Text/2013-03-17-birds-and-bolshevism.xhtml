  <h1 id="post-11147">Birds And Bolshevism</h1>
  <p>I am indebted to Ruth Bosch for drawing to my attention this photograph from <strong><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParaphiliaMagazine" class="external">Paraphilia Magazine</a></em></strong>, captioned “Russian children taking part in a parade celebrating birds helpful to farming, 1934”. It is instructive to realise that Soviet Communism was not an unalloyed disaster, at least in ornithological terms. Needless to say, I am agog to learn precisely which birds were deemed “helpful to farming”. Skylarks? Peewits? Pratincoles? Any readers equally expert in birds and Bolshevism should contact me immediately.</p>
