  <h1 id="post-11979">Pointless Wittering</h1>
  <p class="noindent">She done him wrong, so he took revenge.<br />
  He put her on the bus to Penge.<br />
  She sat down on the upper deck<br />
  And bid farewell to Tooting Bec.<br />
  But the driver got lost and went to Hendon.<br />
  That seems the perfect note to end on.</p>
