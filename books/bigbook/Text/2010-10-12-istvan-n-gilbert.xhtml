  <p>Reading Gilbert Adair's second Evadne Mount mystery, <em>A Mysterious Affair Of Style</em> (2007), I note that his film director character Rex Hanway has a cat called Cato. This served to remind me of a personal favourite from the implausibly vast Hooting Yard archives, the 2004 <strong><a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/archive/jan04.htm#2004-01-02" class="hootingyard">quotation</a></strong> from <em>Spine-Tingling Tales Of Glucose Deficiency</em> by Istvan Scrimgeour&nbsp;:&nbsp; “He had two pets: a cat called Doge and a dog called Cato.”</p>
