  <h1 id="post-891">A Footnote To Despair</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Quite apart from anything else, the <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3362150/Councils-ban-elitist-and-discriminatory-Latin-phrases.html" class="external">dimwits and barbarians</a></strong> have clearly overlooked the fact that “Latin and Greek are the only tongues in which departed spirits can be addressed, for this reason they are denominated the <em>dead</em> languages. The nonappearance of these supernatural beings in the present day, may be fairly ascribed to the decay of the learned languages.” The anonymous contributor to <em>The Mirror Of Taste, And Dramatic Censor, Volume I, Number 5</em> knew this much in May 1810, so the elected representatives of Bournemouth and Salisbury Councils and the unelected dullards at the Plain English Campaign ought to know it too. Perhaps if they wander down to their local Andy Burnham Chat ‘n’ Snack Zone before all the books disappear they might learn something.</p>
