  <h1>Tuesday Weld News</h1>
  <p>Hooting Yard's New Zealand correspondent Glyn Webster writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This seems so eerily Frank Key-ish I'm wondering if you are involved:</p>
    <p><em>Bathtime in Clerkenwell&nbsp;: Go find a friend with a Windows PC to watch this: an animated video for 'The Real Tuesday Weld's Bathtime in Clerkenwell' in which an army of cuckoos attempt to wake and bathe a reluctant human. [ Windows Media ] <a class="external" href="http://www.tuesdayweld.com/video/bathtime.html">http://www.tuesdayweld.com/video/bathtime.html</a></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, I have to report that I am innocent of any involvement in this project. In fact, I have not yet, at time of writing, even viewed the link. But readers of <a class="internal" href="2004-03-14-a-catalogue-of-53-birds.xhtml"><em>A Catalogue of 53 Birds</em></a> will see why Mr Webster diligently reported this finding. Meanwhile, here, as a print-and-cut-out-and-frame souvenir, is a signed picture of Ms Weld:</p>
