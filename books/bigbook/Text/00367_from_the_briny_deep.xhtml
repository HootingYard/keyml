  <h1 id="post-367">From The Briny Deep</h1>
  <p class="noindent"><em>From across the</em> <em>Atlantic</em><em>, Hooting Yard podcast listener and aquatic ecologist Darell Slotton writes with important news from the briny deep:</em></p>
  <p>Hagfish are spectacularly disgusting, being sea bottom, naked-looking, smooth, pink eels with a battery of dodgy looking tendrils around the mouth. They burrow enthusiastically into and through carcasses that fall to the bottom, until they are hollowed out. The sight of a carcass bulging frenetically in the dim undersea light, with a dozen of these lovelies inside, isâ€¦ something. On top of that, if you keep hagfish in an aquarium and reach in to pick them up, they instantly exude a chemical that mixes with seawater to produce a huge ball of snot all around them, which you are left holding as they slip away.</p>
