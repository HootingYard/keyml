  <h1>From Plovdiv</h1>
  <p>Here at Hooting Yard we rarely take note of tennis tournaments, but let it be recorded that Tsvetana Pironkova, who surprisingly knocked Venus Williams out of the Women's Singles at Wimbledon yesterday, hails from Plovdiv in Bulgaria. No doubt the plucky giant-killer was inspired by the <strong><a href="2007-03-14-take-me-back-to-old-plovdiv.xhtml" class="internal" title="Take Me Back To Old Plovdiv">Plovdiv Central Post Office mural</a></strong> painted by Georgi Bozhilov, a member of the legendary Plovdiv Fivesome. Perhaps, too, she grew up listening to the <strong><a href="2007-06-06-knitted-bulgarian-folk-tale-puppet.xhtml" class="internal" title="Knitted Bulgarian Folk Tale Puppet">stories</a></strong> of Ugo and his blind Ma and his pal Ulf in Old Plovdiv. I like to think she owes her success to these things, which have been given the all-important Hooting Yard imprimatur.</p>
