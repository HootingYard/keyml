  <p class="noindent">At last! Say goodbye to lack-of-Hooting-Yard-paperback misery by clutching to your bosom a collection of fifty two stories lovingly collected together in book form! Now, you will be able to perch at the bedside of a pallid and sickly tot and never be at a loss for something to read by candlelight to the wan infant, in between mopping its brow and feeding it spoonfuls of milk of magnesia or some kind of fuming brain tonic.</p>
