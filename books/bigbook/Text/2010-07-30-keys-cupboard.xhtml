  <h1 id="post-4884">Key's Cupboard</h1>
  <p>Mr Key is delighted to announce that his global domination schemes continue apace. Now, in addition to this very Hooting Yard you are reading, the radio show and the vast archive of <strong><a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/hooting" class="external">podcasts</a></strong> available from ResonanceFM, he has found another berth on what our Flemish pals call het internet. Very sensibly, the quintet of indefatigable blogpersons who have created <strong><a href="http://thedabbler-blog.blogspot.com/" class="external">The Dabbler&nbsp;: A Culture Blog</a></strong> have invited your favourite impoverished scribbler to occupy his own cupboard there.</p>

  <p>Postages will be placed in <strong><a href="http://thedabbler-blog.blogspot.com/search/label/Key's%20Cupboard" class="external">Key's Cupboard</a></strong> once a week, probably on Fridays, and include a mix of brand new stuff written exclusively for The Dabbler and forgotten items long buried in the Hooting Yard archives.</p>
  <p>So hie ye over there right now, and make sure you read all the other interesting dabblings. (I particularly recommend the item about the <strong><a href="http://thedabbler-blog.blogspot.com/2010/07/cobham-cuckoos.html" class="external">Cobham Cuckoos</a></strong>.)</p>
