  <h1>Buying Books</h1>
  <p>Today is, apparently, “the start of a two-week frenzy of online shopping”. I am told by persons who know such things that it is much easier to make purchases online than it was for Richard Bradley in the late 18th century trying to <strong><a href="2011-11-28-buying-an-island.xhtml" class="internal" title="Buying An Island">buy an island</a></strong> and having to negotiate with the Tobabmanser of Jancacunda and his singing man. Though in general I disapprove of shopping frenzies, I do think it would be a good idea for you all to go <strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/frankkey" class="external">here</a></strong> and buy copies of all six Hooting Yard books, available in both paperback and ebook formats. They do, after all, make the perfect Christmas gifts for your loved ones.</p>
