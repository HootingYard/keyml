  <h1 id="post-5027">The Sordid Roadsign</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It was remiss of me never to follow up the doings of <strong><a href="2009-11-20-reproachful-n-splotchy.xhtml" class="internal" title="Reproachful &amp; Splotchy">Splotchy Astrid, the reproachful spinster</a></strong>. Many letters have thumped on to the doormat at Haemoglobin Towers from readers eager to know what happened next, and I have ignored them, disgracefully. However, thanks to <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords/cryptic/25088" class="external">No. 25,088 set by Crucible</a></strong>, I can bring you up to speed.</p>
  <p>It seems Splotchy Astrid was tucking in to some <em>tiramisu</em> in a <em>worldly teashop</em>, when a <em>lethargic menial</em> began playing an anthem of the <em>Resistance</em> on a <em>viola</em>. A <em>chill</em> came over the room, and a <em>sagacious adult</em> customer challenged the menial to a bout of <em>fisticuffs</em>. The reproachful spinster was well aware that this was a <em>lethal locality</em>, for her <em>itinerary</em> had taken her past the <em>sordid roadsign</em>, daubed with <em>four letter words</em>, which led her here in the first place. She was the only <em>eyewitness</em> to the altercation, apart from an <em>arty</em> gentleman suffering from <em>amnesia</em>.</p>
  <p>To be continued, one of these days.</p>
