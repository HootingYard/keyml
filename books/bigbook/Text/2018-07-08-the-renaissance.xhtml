  <h1 id="post-16540">The Renaissance</h1>
  <p><em><strong>Renaissance</strong></em>&nbsp;: noun, from the French for “rebirth”. If you stumble upon this word in the course of your reading, you need no longer scratch your head in dimwitted befuddlement. Its primary definition is a reference to the occasion, in early July in the Year of Our Lord MMXVIII, when the Hooting Yard website, having been <em>kaput</em> for some while, came blazing back to life (hence, rebirth) like a phoenix rising from the ashes. (If you want to know what a phoenix is, you will have to wait for the “P” section of the <em>Hooting Yard Guide To Non-Existent Birds.</em>)</p>
