  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“He appears occasionally on the scene, generally entrusted with some death-dealing commission, which he proceeds, scymeter in hand, or provided with bag, cord, box, or poison, to execute; we follow his actions with awe; when he disappears we know no more of him—his further life is shrouded in mystery.” — G Carter Stent, <em>Chinese Eunuchs</em></p>
