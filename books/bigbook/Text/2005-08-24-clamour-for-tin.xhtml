  <h1>Clamour for Tin</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Monday's <em>Metal Of The Week</em> item on tin proved surprisingly popular with readers, and I have received quite a few requests for additional tin-related material. I do not mean to be churlish, but if my biographer devil, the enigmatic Jeb (see 19th August) is going to have anything of interest to write, he will need me to do more than trudge back and forth to the library to consult dusty old reference books about metals. As a sop to the tin-fixated, however, Max Décharné helpfully comes to the rescue with this:</p>

  <p class="noindent">There you are, two more tins. I am no expert on this particular hound o' film, but I can tell you one thing. So devoted was Rin Tin Tin's owner, Corporal Lee Duncan, that when his wife filed for divorce, she cited Rin Tin Tin as co-respondent, saying Duncan loved the dog more than her. The divorce case was dropped and never granted.</p>
  <p class="noindent">Meanwhile, out in Texas, apparently, “the 87-year legacy continues at El Rancho Rin Tin Tin”, which is a bit like El Rancho Hooting Yard, but with dogs.</p>
