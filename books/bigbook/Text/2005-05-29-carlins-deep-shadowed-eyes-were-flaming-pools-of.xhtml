  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Carlin's deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace. ‘I could shoot you both down where you stand,’ he rasped, ‘but that would be a foolish waste of valuable material… I shall turn the two of you over to the Dweller in the pool!’ Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's thin lips writhed in a snarling smile… ‘Who, or what, is the Dweller in the pool?’ demanded Kent, 'And what devil's work is Carlin doing here anyway?' ‘The Dweller in the pool,’ Dorothy answered, her low voice trembling, ‘is my brother, Raoul!’ … Small wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine to taint the very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitant dread!” — Hal K Wells, <em>Black Pool For Hell Maidens</em></p>
