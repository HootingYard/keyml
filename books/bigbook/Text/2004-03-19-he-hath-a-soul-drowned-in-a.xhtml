  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“He hath a soul drowned in a lump of flesh, or is a piece of earth that Prometheus put not half his proportion of fire into … The Muses and the Graces are his hard mistresses; though he daily invocate them, though he sacrifice hecatombs, they still look asquint. You shall note him (besides his dull eye, and lowering head, and a certain clammy benumbed pace) by a fair displayed beard, a night-cap, and a gown … His jests are either old fled proverbs, or lean-starved hackney apophthegms, or poor verbal quips, outworn by serving-men, tapsters, and milkmaids.” — Sir Thomas Overbury, <em>Characters; or Witty Descriptions of the Properties of Sundry Persons</em></p>
