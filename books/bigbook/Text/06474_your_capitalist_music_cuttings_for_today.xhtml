  <h1 id="post-6474">Your Capitalist Music Cuttings For Today</h1>
  <p class="noindent">No luck as yet with the decipherment of the great Steve Bloch's lyrical sally in <strong><a href="06474_your_capitalist_music_cuttings_for_today.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Land Of Cheese And Wine">“Jane's Gone To France”</a></strong>. But for those of you keen to see the resurrection of perhaps the most important beat combo ever to mention Marshal Petain in a song, here are some cuttings culled from distant outposts of Interwebshire.</p>
  <p>First, two reviews of the magnum opus itself, from a couple of local rags. Please note that a young Mr Key did not write either of them.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Second, unfortunately as low in resolution as he was high in importance, Bloch himself, on stage.</p>
