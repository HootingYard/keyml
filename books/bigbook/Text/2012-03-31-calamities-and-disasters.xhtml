  <h1 id="post-8808">Calamities And Disasters</h1>
  <p>I noticed that on BBC1 yesterday there was the first in a short series of programmes called <em>Titanic With Len Goodman</em>â€”Mr Goodman being one of the judges from <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. It is a curious combination of presenter and subject, and I wonder if we can look forward to <em>Hindenburg With Alesha Dixon</em>, <em>The Munich Air Disaster With Bruno Tonioni</em>, <em>The Tay Bridge Disaster With Craig Revel-Horwood</em>, T<em>he Lisbon Earthquake With Arlene Phillips</em>, and, perhaps, <em>The Black Death With Tess Daly</em>.</p>
