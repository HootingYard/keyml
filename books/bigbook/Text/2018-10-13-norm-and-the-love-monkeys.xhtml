  <h1>Norm &amp; The Love Monkeys</h1>
  <p class="noindent">The <a href="https://www.drabblecast.org/2018/10/10/drabblecast-presents-far-far-away/" class="external"><strong>latest episode</strong></a> of the recently-resurrected Drabblecast is devoted to Mr Key. It includes Norm Sherman's magnificent reading of the exciting sci-fi story “Far, Far Away”. If you have not previously heard Norm intone the words “magnetic mute blind love monkeys”, you are in for a rare treat. If you have heard him, you will know that there are few instances in the history of recorded sound that are quite so unforgettable.</p>
