  <h1>Friday Quiz</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I snap my fingers and, <em>foof-la!</em>, inaugurate the Hooting Yard Friday Quiz. (It is likely, not to say inevitable, that tomorrow I shall snap my fingers again and, <em>foof-la!</em>, abolish the Hooting Yard Friday Quiz, so make the most of it while you have the chance.)</p>
  <p>This week's challenge is to identify correctly the forty-seven fictional characters listed yesterday in the piece <strong><em><a href="2011-07-14-unhinged-by-cream-crackers.xhtml" class="internal" title="Unhinged By Cream Crackers">Unhinged By Cream Crackers</a></em></strong>. You need to provide the title of the work, be it a novel or a play or a film or what have you, where the character first appeared.</p>
  <p>The first person to post a full and correct list in the Comments will win a modest prize. I do not yet know what it will be, but I will think of something, and it will not be a world cruise aboard the HMS Corrugated Cardboard.</p>
