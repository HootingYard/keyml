    <p class="caption">This week in <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I conduct a long-overdue <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/02/keys-cupboard-an-inquiry-into-the-death-of-virginia-woolf/" class="external">inquiry into the death of Virginia Woolf</a></strong>. If everything goes according to plan, this should be the first in a series of inquiries into the deaths of the great modernists, a necessary step, surely, into any proper understanding of <em>post</em>modernism. I have convinced myself that, once I fully grasp every last little detail of the deaths of the modernists, I will be in a much better position to winkle some meaning out of the endless clogged blather of standard po-mo prose. Some would say it is not worth the effort, and they are probably correct, so perhaps I ought to put the whole project into a dustbin or wastepaper basket. What a quandary!</p>
