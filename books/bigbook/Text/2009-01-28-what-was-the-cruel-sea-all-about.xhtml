  <h1 id="post-1565">What Was “The Cruel Sea” All About?</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I ought to have explained that the piece entitled <a href="2009-01-28-the-cruel-sea.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Cruel Sea"><strong>The Cruel Sea</strong></a> was simply a list of titles of the books currently being written by bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead. He always has a number of works on the go at any one time, expertly juggling everything in that big baked potato-like head of his. Hooting Yard reader Dr Ruth Pastry tells me that she is drawing a diagram of Pebblehead's head, or more precisely of the innards of his head, which she wants me to post here when it is finished. That means we will all have a better, and long overdue, insight into the great paperbackist's fantastic brain, in diagrammatic form, with arrows.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> Dr Pastry says her diagram will be without arrows.</p>
