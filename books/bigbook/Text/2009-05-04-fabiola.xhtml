  <h1 id="post-2411">Fabiola</h1>
  <p>Mr Key would like to draw to your attention a small exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. <em>Fabiola</em> is a collection of mostly “amateur” portraits of Saint Fabiola, collected over the years by the Flemish artist Francis AlÃ¿s. They are all based on a single source, a now lost 19th century painting, which means they look almost identical—but they're not, of course. The effect of seeing them all gathered together in a couple of rooms is quite mesmerising. The official gallery page is <strong><a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/event-root/francis-alys-fabiola.php" class="external">here</a></strong>, and there is a photograph of an earlier showing in New York <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/arts/design/05alys.html" class="external">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
