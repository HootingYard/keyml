  <h1 id="post-170">Those Frankish Kings&nbsp;: A Multimedia Approach</h1>
  <p>An extract from Mrs Gubbins' so-called <em>Mission Statement:</em></p>
  <p>“We will seek new ways to enhance our readers' Hooting Yard experience. For example, we should strain mightily to harness the awesome power of the interweb to create what I think are known as <em>multimedia</em> formats. We should exploit different <em>platforms</em> and <em>portals</em>. The site will strive to be a <em>critical hub</em> for the Hooting Yard <em>community</em>. Now get on with it! You can make a start by bunging in a few pictures so that readers can visualise those Frankish kings mentioned in <a href="2007-05-21-annals-of-the-frankish-kings.xhtml" class="internal" title="Annals Of The Frankish Kings"><em><strong>Annals Of The Frankish Kings</strong></em></a>, or at least some of them.”</p>
  <p>Ever mindful that Mrs Gubbins has a matchless grasp of what really matters in this often perplexing world, we have taken her advice. Here, then, are three of those Frankish kings.</p>
