  <p>“Overhead, there would sound a curious wailing from Father Bernard's room. When I first heard this sharp cry break out on Monday morning, I had supposed that Father Bernard was either having a fit or whipping himself. [Eric] Gill, however, had quickly reassured me. It appeared that Father Bernard's vocal cords were not all they might be and that he was studying a new method of voice-production, invented by a man called White, in which the vocal cords were dispensed with altogether and the notes produced by expansion and contraction of the sinuses. This did not seem to me possible.”</p>
  <p>Rayner Heppenstall, <em>Four Absentees</em> (1960)</p>
