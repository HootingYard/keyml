  <h1 id="post-159">From The Archives</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It has been suggested to me that I ought to transfer the vast Hooting Yard Archive 2003–2006 into this blog format so that readers can skip happily about tracking down their favourite items with ease. That sounds like a job for a factotum. <em>[That would be us —Hooting Yard Archivists]</em> Is it possible to be one's own factotum? While I ponder such an imponderable, I may post a few orts and scantlings from the Archive here, in a whimsical manner. This, for example, which first appeared on Thursday 18th March 2004.</p>
