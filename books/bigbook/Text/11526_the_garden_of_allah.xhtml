  <h1 id="post-11526">The Garden Of Allah</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Allahu Akbar!” I shout, as I deadhead the roses. I am an Islamic gardener. The gardens I tend are based upon Islamic principles, and contain not a whiff of kaffir filth. No woman shall ever besmirch the gravel paths between the flower beds. And whenever a bloom sprouts atop a green stalk, I take my combination scimitar-and-secateurs and lop it off, in praise of Allah.</p>
  <p>The only plants I allow to flourish are varieties of Old Man's Beard, including <em>Chionanthus virginicus</em>, a tree both medicinal and ornamental, <em>Clematis aristata</em>, an Australian climbing plant, <em>Clematis vitalba</em>, another climbing plant, <em>Tillandsia usneoides</em>, or Spanish moss, a bromeliad, and <em>Usnea</em>, a type of lichen. Because they vaguely resemble an old man's beard, they are suitably Islamic.</p>
  <p>Occasionally I am mistaken for a hippy gardener, Steve Hillage of Gong with a spade in place of a guitar. I have been told we are like two peas in a pod. But there are no peas in my gardens, because peapods do not have beards.</p>
