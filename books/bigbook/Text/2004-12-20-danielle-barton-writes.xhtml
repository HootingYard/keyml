  <h1>Danielle Barton Writes</h1>
  <p>I received a thrilling email from Danielle Barton, who says, among other things: <em>Hello, I visited your site</em><em>and feel that your site would be perfect for inclusion in our free yard directory.</em> I was very touched that Ms Barton had presumably spent her weekend reading the Hooting Yard pages in order to arrive at her view that the site is “perfect for inclusion” in her listing. It is quite an honour to get such a vote of confidence from someone who specialises in yards. I am going to write back to her to express my profound gratitude, and I may slip in a question that has been preoccupying me since I read her delightful letter. “Are you by any chance,” I will ask, “related to Special Agent Dick Barton from the long-ago radio serial?”</p>
  <p>As I sit here basking in the glow of being included in a free yard directory, I cannot help but feel a slight pang of disappointment that to date no hooting specialist has written to invite me to be in a free hooting directory. Perhaps that wondrous day will come before such time as I become a doddery, spavined and toothless wretch. Possibly by next Friday, then.</p>
