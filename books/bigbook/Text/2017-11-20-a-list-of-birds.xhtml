  <h1 id="post-15926">A List Of Birds</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Eleven years ago, I devoted an episode of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> to reading out a list of 601 birds, plus an astronomer, a newsreader, 2 jazzmen, 5 film directors, and 34 stars of stage and screen. This recording—hugely significant both culturally and ornithologically—has now been made readily available, split into three parts by dint of YouTubeosity. I strongly advise you lot to listen to the whole thing, repeatedly, umpteen times a day, until you have it committed to memory. You will find it invaluable next time you are leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party and there is a lull in the conversation.</p>
