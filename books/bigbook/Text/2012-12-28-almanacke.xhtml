  <p class="noindent">Over at <em>The Dabbler</em> today you will find <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2012/12/old-keys-almanacke-2/" class="external">Old Key's Almanacke</a></strong>, a list of a dozen prognostications of what will befall us in the coming twelvemonth. The spooky thing about Old Key is that he has been proved unerringly accurate, time and time again. I am not entirely sure who he is, or was, other than that his papers were discovered in a shoebox underneath a sink in a cubby in an old manse perched on a windswept hillside. The papers, bound into a series of Almanackes, had been piddled upon by generations of feral cats. On the rotting linoleum next to the shoebox lay a wand and a pointy hat. They too had been piddled upon, by something bigger and more terrible than a feral cat.</p>
