  <p class="noindent"><em>Peter Blegvad, from “The Unborn Byron”:</em></p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Spread the word, tomorrow morn<br />
  A future poet shall be born.<br />
  From my mother I shall fall<br />
  Into the womb that holds us all.<br />
  My life shall be a meteor<br />
  Which generations shall adore.<br />
  For my unbuttoned liberty<br />
  The unborn will remember me.</p>
  <p><em>Mr Key, from “The Tiny Newborn Mr Key”:</em></p>
  <p class="linebreaks">1959, this very morn<br />
  The tiny Mr Key was born<br />
  He was a full month premature<br />
  When he knocked his fist upon the door<br />
  Of the world beyond his mother's womb<br />
  A tiny bright spark in the gloom<br />
  And soon the words poured out of him<br />
  They pour out still, with ceaseless vim.</p>
