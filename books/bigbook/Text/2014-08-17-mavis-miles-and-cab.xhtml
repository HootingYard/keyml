  <h1>Mavis, Miles, &amp; Cab</h1>
  <p class="linebreaks noindent">Miles Davis dials Mavis<br />
  To blow his trumpet in her ear<br />
  Mavis slams the phone down<br />
  And sheds a bitter tear<br />
  She's a little old woman who lives in a shoe<br />
  And she's feeling kind of blue.</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">Cab Calloway calls a cab for her<br />
  And drives her to the future<br />
  Now she's no longer Mavis<br />
  Instead she's Minnie the Moocher</p>
  <p class="linebreaks">She mooches and she smooches<br />
  Does fandangos in the aisles<br />
  Goodbye to that confounded shoe<br />
  {And thank the Lord!)<br />
  â€˜She didn't take that call from Miles</p>
