  <h1>A Danish Pencil</h1>
  <p>Pansy Cradledew recently spent three days in rural Denmark. Upon her return, she presented me with some small gifts of Danish stationery. Among these was a pencil, along the barrel of which the following phrases are stamped:</p>
  <p>GRAKS AGANAK PIKIPOF</p>
  <p>AUTOMOLOK TITA TITO</p>
  <p>PLOKS GUGANAGA PLIP</p>
  <p>I suspect this is probably gobbledegook rather than Danish, although there is a distinct possibility it might be <strong><a href="2011-08-29-real-orghast.xhtml" class="internal" title="Real Orghast">Real Orghast</a></strong>. If any reader can tell me what it means, please do so in the Comments.</p>
