  <h1>Goon Fang&nbsp;: A Correction</h1>
  <p>Further to yesterday's item <em>Pansy The Adept</em>, Pansy Cradledew has asked me to publish the following statement:</p>
  <p>I fear that in your ill-considered witterings about the ancient mystic art of Goon Fang, you gave the impression that I am an Adept. There are many—indeed, countless—levels of eptness within Goon Fang, and I wish it to be quite clear to your readers that I am an Inept. If you do not publish this correction on your website, I shall have no choice but to make a visitation to Haemoglobin Towers and enact the Goon Fang movement known as The Fluttering Sociopathic Moth-Being, guaranteed to give you hideous nightmares for the rest of your life, believe you me.</p>
