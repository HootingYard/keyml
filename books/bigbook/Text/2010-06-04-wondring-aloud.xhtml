  <p>As I lumber about this world of ours, by turns perky and despondent, I often find myself wondering if it would be possible to enjoy all the comforts of twenty-first century western civilisation were I to be uprooted and cast, by some inexplicable agency, to live out the rest of my days on one of those far distant giant gas planets.</p>
  <p>Probably not.</p>
