  <h1 id="post-8655">The Names Of Rivers</h1>
  <p class="noindent">From today's <em><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/13/in-praise-of-the-names-of-rivers" class="external">Grauniad</a></strong></em>. Well worth memorising (and adding to).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">England's drought draws attention to the condition of England's rivers. And England's rivers—with those in Scotland and Wales—have ancient names, often conferred before the Roman legions came, and passed down almost unchanged to the present. Daily Mail spread on the misery that will last all summer featured the Bewl, the Chess and the Pang. But these are just the start. What about the Mease, the Tees, the Dee, the Cree, the Nar, the Ter and the Ver? Or the Box, the Yox and the Axe? Or the Neet, the Fleet and the Smite? Do not forget, either, the Ebble, the Piddle, the Polly, the Nadder or the Wandle. Or the Feshie, the Mashie and the Wissey. Then there are the Lugg, the Ugie, the Meggat, the Tud, the Lud and the Irt. Like these other rivers, the Wampool, the Snizort, the Skirfare, the Deveron, the Cocker and the Stinchar speak of a deep Britain, to which we are more connected than we realise. Or would be if it rained.</p>
