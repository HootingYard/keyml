  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“She sank deeper and deeper into seclusion, and during the twenty-seven years she lived in Rome she left her home in the Via del Babuino only once for twenty-four hours. She grew more and more immersed in the Church and its affairs. Gregororius said she fairly ‘sputtered spirituality’. Her chief work was a twenty-four-volume study bearing the thrilling title, <em>Interior Causes of the Exterior Weakness of the Church</em>. This ponderous affair she finished a few days before her death.” — Rupert Hughes, <em>The Love Affairs of Great Musicians</em>, on Franz Liszt's lover Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein</p>
