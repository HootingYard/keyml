  <h1 id="post-8278">A Mystery Solved</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Last April I posted a <strong><a href="08278_a_mystery_solved.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Land Of Cheese And Wine">plea for help</a></strong>. For thirty years I had been incapable of deciphering part of the lyric of Capitalist Music's titanic masterpiece “Jane's Gone To France”. Several readers tried, but failed, to work out what on earth the great Steve Bloch was harping on about, and were equally as baffled as me.</p>
  <p>Now, out of the blue, someone called Matt has added to the comments on that post, and provided the answer. And of course, when you listen to the song again, knowing what Matt has told you, it seems absolutely clear, and indeed obvious.</p>
  <p>I doubt that any of you care very much, but this has made me happy. Thank you, Matt.</p>
