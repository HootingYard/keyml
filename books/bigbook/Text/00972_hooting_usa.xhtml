  <p class="noindent">In case it's overlooked in the Comments to the piece below, here is an informative memorandum from R.:</p>
  <p><em>It is unimaginably strange to hear an ‘Unspeakable Desolation’ story read in a US accent … for those not traumatised by the mere suggestion, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/58avg5" class="external">http://tinyurl.com/58avg5</a>&nbsp; is the place to go, but you have to weather an advertisement, a dictionary definition, and some stuff about trains before the dawning of the Main Feature. ‘Weird, awesome stuff,’ the host declares.</em></p>
  <p>I have to say I like Norm Sherman's narration very much, particularly the way he intones the words “magnetic … mute … blind … love monkeys”.&nbsp;</p>
