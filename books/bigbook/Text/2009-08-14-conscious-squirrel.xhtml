  <h1 id="post-2871">Conscious Squirrel!</h1>
  <p class="noindent">At the beginning of the year, you may recall, in homage to George Orwell's egg-counting mania, I began a daily <strong><a href="2009-08-14-conscious-squirrel.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Diligent Counting Of Squirrels">squirrel count</a></strong>. Alas, I lack the single-minded diligence necessary for so useful a pastime, and I am afraid the count petered out on, er, the <strong><a href="2009-08-14-conscious-squirrel.xhtml" class="internal" title="Squirrel Count">second</a></strong> of January.</p>
  <p>I mention this solely as a pretext to draw to your attention <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6018173/Squirrel-is-surprise-star-of-holiday-photo.html" class="external">this squirrel</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>It is said somewhere, possibly by Dobson, that every fictional hero has an antipole, an eerie opposite that features in an—almost certainly unwritten—mirror of the original work. (If it <em>was</em> Dobson, it is a shame he never developed this thesis into an entire pamphlet.) I think we can safely say that what we have here is the antipole of <strong><a href="2009-08-14-conscious-squirrel.xhtml" class="internal" title="Unconscious Squirrel!">Unconscious Squirrel!</a></strong>, the unconscious squirrel.</p>
