  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“On the second day, sahib, as I sought in the darkest part of the forest among great trees of <em>Padouk</em> and <em>Sal</em> many cubits high, it happened that I heard a great rending of wood, and lifting my eyes, I beheld the father of all the <em>Nats</em> tear a great tree asunder and spring at me from the bowels thereof. The face was the face of the <em>Boh</em>, only more terrible, but the arms were of the thickness of a man's leg, and hairy as those of a spider.” — Gordon McCreagh, <em>The Wood Devil Thing</em></p>
