  <p>There are two films I adore without reservation. Both of them have been constant guiding influences on me, either consciously or in more subtle ways. One of them, Jacques Rivette's <em>Celine And Julie Go Boating</em> (1974) I have seen umpteen times, whereas the other, Peter Greenaway's <em>A Walk Through H&nbsp;: The Reincarnation Of An Ornithologist</em> (1978), I saw once shortly after its release and only again last year.</p>
  <p>Of course there are dozens, or hundreds, of other films I have relished over the years, from <em>Brief Encounter</em> to <em>Aguirre, The Wrath Of God</em>, from <em>Love And Death</em> to <em>Random Harvest</em>, but somehow those two have been my touchstones. I saw them first when I was young, and they opened up new imaginative possibilities to me. It would not be true to say that I haven't been bowled over by a film since then, rather that I can't think of one that has given me precisely that sense of wide-eyed surprised gleeful imaginative abandon.</p>
  <p>Until yesterday, when I went to see <em>Brand</em> <em>Upon The Brain!</em> by Guy Maddin. Hooting Yardists will need only to know that the film takes place in a lighthouse orphanage on Black Notch island, that the characters include a harp-playing teenage detective and an evil boffin in his underground lab, and that communications are made via aerophones and a foghorn, to understand my enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>Here is Andrew Sarris in The New York Observer: “<em>Brand Upon The Brain!</em> succeeds at one and the same time in functioning as both a celebration and a deconstruction of the conscious and unconscious glories of silent movies through the barely thirty years of their existence at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Let us say simply and definitively that I have never seen anything like it. The pace of the twelve chapters, told over the course of ninety-five minutes, surges along, propelled by the archaic silent-movie storytelling device of intertitles coupled with a faux-naif verbal narration…[it] is one of the most compelling avant-garde excursions into the narrative cinema ever.”</p>
  <p>Apparently the film is to be released on DVD next month, so everyone should buy a copy. It is a work of genius.</p>
