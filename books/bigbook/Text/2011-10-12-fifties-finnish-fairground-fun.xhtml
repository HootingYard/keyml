  <blockquote>
    <p>Luna Park, the Linnanmäki [in Helsinki] … is high above the city on a granite outcrop with a water-tower that looks like a stone gasometer with trees growing on top, and which is circled with lights… One side-show, to judge by the pictures outside, was a house in which people are attacked by bees.</p>
  </blockquote>
