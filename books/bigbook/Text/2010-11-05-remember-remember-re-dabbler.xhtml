    <p class="caption">In my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2010/11/keys-cupboard-remember-remember/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week, I have transcribed the words of a children's song appropriate for today's date.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="noindent">The song is taken from a garish publication of the last century entitled <em>Special Agent Rastus Blot's Traditional Songbook For Winsome Tinies</em>. It was a piece of spectacular self-aggrandisement by Blot. Though the songs purport to be much-loved chants and ditties sung by billions of children around the world, they were all in fact devised by the Special Agent himself, and feature him in a starring role, carrying out deeds of daring and bravado. When I did some research into the matter, I discovered that not one tiny has been heard singing any of these songs, anywhere, ever.</p>
  <p>Quite frankly, if you are going to present an urchin with a book as a gift, I would give Special Agent Rastus Blot's farrago of nonsense a wide berth and buy <em><strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/impugned-by-a-peasant-other-stories/13042967" class="external">Impugned By A Peasant &amp; Other Stories</a></strong></em> instead.</p>
