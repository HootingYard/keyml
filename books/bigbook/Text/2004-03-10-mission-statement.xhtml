  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  <p class="noindent">This site is nearly three months old, and it has been suggested that it cannot long continue without a definitive Mission Statement. Below is a first draft, the fruit of long minutes spent cogitating while wolfing down a bowl of Special K. I suggest that readers copy and paste it into a word-processor document, print it out, get it laminated, and—whenever visiting Hooting Yard—place it next to the screen for ready reference.</p>
  <h2>Hooting Yard Mission Statement</h2>
  <p class="noindent"><strong>We will find a window in our schedule to take a proactive approach to thinking outside the box, pushing the envelope and running things up the flagpole 24/7, like totally. Pick the bones out of that one, innit. It's not rocket science—it's a no-brainer.</strong></p>
