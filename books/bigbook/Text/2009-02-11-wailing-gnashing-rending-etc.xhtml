  <h1>Wailing, Gnashing, Rending, Etc</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Astute readers will note that posts currently appear undated and without a comment option. This is due to one of those laughably-named “upgrades”, which as far as I can see just make life more difficult. Fear not, equilibrium will be restored as soon as possible. I will be <strong><a href="2009-02-10-hooting-yard-on-witter.xhtml" class="internal" title="Hooting Yard On Witter">wittering</a></strong> about this in due course (i.e., in approximately fifty years time).</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> Dates and Comments restored, as you can see. The Yard's boffin is working on further tweaks to tidy up the spacing between posts and a few other horrors.</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> Back to normal. I suppose I could delete this post, but I will leave it here for the historical record, to be pored over by future scholars. Also, leaving it here means I can continue to assert that there has been at least one posting every day since the sixteenth of December last year, which makes a change from the awful hiatuses (hiatae?) of yore.</p>
