  <p>“His epitaph upon the duck he killed by treading on it at five years old—<em>Here lies poor duck / That Samuel Johnson trod on; / If it had liv'd it had been good luck, / For it would have been an odd one</em>—is a striking example of early expansion of mind and knowledge of language” — Hesther Lynch Piozzi, <em>Anecdotes Of The Late Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em></p>
