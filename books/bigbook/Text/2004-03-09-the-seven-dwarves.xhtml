  <h1>The Seven Dwarves</h1>
  <p>Is nothing sacred? In this age of pointless but seemingly obsessive rebranding, news reaches us that Snow White's diminutive pals, the seven dwarves, are to be given new names. From next Friday, apparently, they are to be known as Wretched, Spiteful, Incontinent, Wistful, Lippy, Rancorous &amp; Preening.</p>
  <p>On a related note, Pansy Cradledew has brought to my attention the growing debate over the identity of the “Eighth Dwarf”, akin to the long-running argument as to who exactly deserves the title of the “Fifth Beatle”. Pansy hopes to bring us the latest news on this important subject very, very soon.</p>
