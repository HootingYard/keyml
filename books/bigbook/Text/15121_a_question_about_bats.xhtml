  <h1 id="post-15121">A Question About Bats</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I have not bothered to look this up in any reference books, so please forgive me if the answer is blindingly obvious.</p>
  <p>What, I would like to know, is the quality inherent in the excrement expelled by bats that is related to human madness? I am thinking of the phrase <em>batshit crazy</em>. We do not commonly say, for example, <em>catshit crazy</em> or <em>giraffeshit crazy</em> or <em>puff-addershit crazy</em>, or at least I have not heard these phrases used at the sort of swish sophisticated cocktail parties I try to barge my way into. But reference to the droppings of bats is made frequently.</p>
  <p>Answers in the Comments please, unless you are batshit crazy yourself, in which case you would be more appropriately occupied reading something by Will Self.</p>
