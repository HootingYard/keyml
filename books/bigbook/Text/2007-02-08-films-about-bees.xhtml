  <h1 id="post-35">Films About Bees</h1>
  <p class="noindent">One of the most eagerly-anticipated awards in the arts calendar is Hooting Yard's <em>Best Title Of A Film About Bees Made Within The Last Five Years</em>. We only make this award after a rigorous selection process, fuelled by many, many cups of piping hot tea in Mrs Gubbinsâ€™ space-age kitchenette parlour.</p>
  <p>I am delighted to announce that the 2007 Award goes to William Bishop-Stephens for <strong>Bee Control In City Parks</strong>. He wins a toffee apple with bite marks which, a dentist tells me, could well have been made by fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol immediately after he won the 1966 Blister Lane Bypass Sprint Hurdles Cup And Saucer in a then record time of eight hours, sixteen minutes and forty-four seconds.</p>
  <p>Well done, Will, and I am sure all Hooting Yard readers will take the opportunity to <a href="http://wrongboy.wordpress.com/2006/10/31/test-2/" class="external">watch</a> your splendid film.</p>
