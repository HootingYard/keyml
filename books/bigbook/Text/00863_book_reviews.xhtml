  <h1 id="post-863">Book Reviews</h1>
  <p class="noindent">When the usual suspects publish their books, they can be guaranteed to pat each other on the back in the pages of their North London Literary Mafia house journals. When a starving scrivener such as Mr Key <strong><a href="00863_book_reviews.xhtml" class="internal" title="Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude &amp; Pippy Bags">publishes</a></strong> <strong><a href="00863_book_reviews.xhtml" class="internal" title="Befuddled by Cormorants">his</a></strong> <strong><a href="00863_book_reviews.xhtml" class="internal" title="Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars">books</a></strong>, he does so to resounding indifference from those same publications. This is neither surprising nor particularly exasperating (on a good day), but it is a lamentable state of affairs. In the past, some review copies have been sent out, but they may as well have been chewed up by a post office hound.</p>
  <p>It occurs to me that Hooting Yard readers might wish to marshal the power of the interweb and write their own reviews, to be posted on their own blogs, if they have such things, or on a dedicated page here. This would give new visitors some idea of what delights await them, and also be a generally cockle-warming exercise for all concerned. Just a (possibly ill-advised) thought, in a moment of grumpiness.</p>
