  <p>“Will you come with me to Belshazzar's feast?” asked Agnetha.</p>
  <p>“I didn't know you'd been invited. I'll have to ask Björn,” said Benny.</p>
  <p>Benny strode off into the mountains to find Björn. Agnetha stayed at the hotel, sipping her alcohol-free absinthe. Wild winds were howling and storm clouds gathered.</p>
  <p>Benny found Björn sheltering in a declivity. He was burning charcoal.</p>
  <p>“Agnetha wants me to go with her to Belshazzar's feast,” said Benny, after tipping his hat to Björn in greeting, “What do you think?”</p>
  <p>“The gods may throw a dice,” said Björn, “Their minds as cold as ice.” He stared off into the mist-enshrouded distance, towards the fireworks factory and the abandoned tennis courts.</p>
  <p>“I shall reflect on what you have said and come to a decision, then,” said Benny, “Thank you.”</p>
  <p>On the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on the mountain path by Anni-Frid. She was dressed like a gaucho and looked as if she had been weeping.</p>
  <p>“Anni-Frid, whatever is the matter?” asked Benny.</p>
  <p>Anni-Frid dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel. Her upper lip curled in a sneer. Discomfited by her silence, Benny began to gabble.</p>
  <p>“Agnetha asked me to accompany her to Belshazzar's feast,” he said, “And I asked Björn for his advice. He is up there in a declivity burning charcoal.”</p>
  <p>“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,” said Anni-Frid, and she pranced away into the mist.</p>
