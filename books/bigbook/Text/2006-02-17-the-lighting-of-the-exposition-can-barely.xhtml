  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The lighting of the exposition can barely be touched upon in a few paragraphs and it would be difficult to describe in words even if space were unlimited. It represented the power of light to beautify and to awe… It was a crowning achievement of a century of public lighting which began with Murdock's initial display of a hundred flickering gas-jets… It was a silent but pulsating display of grandeur dwarfing into insignificance the aurora borealis in its most resplendent moments.” — M Luckiesh, <em>Artificial Light</em></p>
