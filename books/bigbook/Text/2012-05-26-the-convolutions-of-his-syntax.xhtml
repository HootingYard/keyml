  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">His students realised that they had a legend on their hands, and made the most of it. Dozens of stories circulated about his rumbustious asides, his impossible handwriting, the convolutions of his syntax.*</p>
    <p>* In the Saintsbury <em>Memorial Volume</em> a former student recalls learning a specimen sentence by heart: ‘But while none, save these, of men living, had done, or could have done, such things, there was much here which—whether either could have done it or not—neither had done.’</p>
  </blockquote>
