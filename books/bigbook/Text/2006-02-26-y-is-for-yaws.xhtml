  <h1>Y Is for Yaws</h1>
  <p class="noindent">The penultimate chapter of our serial story <em>The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet</em></p>
  <p>Blodgett suffered dreadfully from yaws, but the condition cannot excuse his behaviour. Yaws is also known as framboesia. Blodgett was also known as Jubble. The deception had been difficult. Sometimes he had had to be in two places at once. Moop had been willing to impersonate him from time to time, no questions asked. She had been a useful ally, but he had begun to distrust her. She would be the next to go, after Ruhugu. Preening his mustachios, he cackled, as if he were a character in a nineteenth century melodrama.</p>
