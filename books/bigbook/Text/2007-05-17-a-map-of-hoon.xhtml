  <h1 id="post-163">A Map Of Hoon</h1>
  <p>What land is on my map? A country I call Hoon, a land of clatter and banging, of hideous shrubs and rivers. My eyes reject its coloursâ€”it's grey and blue in blotches. I keep a vinegar-stained map rolled up in my little suitcase. Proud, majestic, grand, I leapfrog in the darkness. My torch shines on my map, a map made by an idiot. One day I'll lose my thread. I'll stumble in the bracken, catch fire, blaze, then smoulder. That land was just a rumour.</p>
