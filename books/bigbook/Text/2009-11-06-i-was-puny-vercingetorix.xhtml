  <p><em>I Was Puny Vercingetorix&nbsp;: a novel by Lars Talc</em> (2003) is not a novel and it is not by Lars Talc. It is not a book at all. It is an <em>objet d'art</em>.</p>

  <p>In the words of art critic Cosmo Hoxtonwanker, “it is a bold, transgressive, edgy work, interrogating notions of authenticity, desire, and <em>jouissance</em> while incorporating both dippiness and a Playmobil figure holding a vacuum cleaner under some streamers. If it was for sale, I would pay millions for it.”</p>
