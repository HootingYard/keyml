  <h1>Parlour Games</h1>
  <p class="noindent">One of the more profound mysteries of modern Hollywood is the career of Kevin Costner. He makes a hugely expensive, brainless film—as actor, director, producer or any combination thereof—which is critically reviled and commercially disastrous, and lo! rather than being cast into the outer darkness, gets to do the same thing again—and again. Truly puzzling.</p>
  <p>Which is by way of preamble to one of our favourite parlour games, <em>Costner!</em> Players take it in turns to name Kevin Costner-related films <em>ad nauseam</em>, the winner being the last one to raid their memory-banks successfully. Tactics are crucial—how long should one delay playing a triumphant “<em>Tin Cup</em>!!!”?</p>
