  <p>Imagine for a moment that you have a pet swan. What would you call it? Alan? Belinda? Clive? Dot? I could continue through the alphabet, but I won't, not for the time being. If I did, we would soon enough get to J. I like to think that I would not, at that juncture, pick the name Jack. Not for a swan. It doesn't seem right. Yet that is the name Anna Pavlova gave to her swan, as can be seen in this tremendous photograph, kindly sent to me by <strong><a href="http://nervoussquirrel.com/" class="external">David Cranmer</a></strong>.
