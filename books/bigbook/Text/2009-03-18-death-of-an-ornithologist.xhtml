  <p><em>There is an obituary in today's</em> Guardian <em>of ornithologist David Snow, who died in February, You can read the whole thing <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/18/obituary-david-snow-birdwatching" class="external">here</a></strong>, but I have helpfully extracted the more arresting bits:</em></p>
  <p>[He] pioneered studies of three of the world's rarest birds: the lava gull, the nocturnal swallow-tailed gull and the flightless cormorant.</p>
  <p>His father also gave him a pair of pocketable first world war German Goerz binoculars.</p>

  <p>He maximised his ornithological shore leave by having his bicycle sent ahead by train to suitable British ports.</p>
  <p>in 1958, [he] married Barbara Whitaker. Between them, they pioneered studies on such species as hermit hummingbirds, the bearded bellbird and the extraordinary cave-dwelling oilbird which emerges at night to feed on fruit, navigating by echo-location, using audible clicks.</p>
  <p>he was active to the end of his life: a scholarly little note about the feeding of blackcaps wintering in his Wingrave garden appeared in the January bulletin of the Buckinghamshire bird club.</p>
