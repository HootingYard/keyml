  <h1 id="post-6130">Bootless Hawk</h1>
  <p>It was raining on the moors. Ted was peering through his binoculars at a hawk. Suddenly Sylvia appeared. She nudged the binoculars aside and kissed Ted, drawing blood.</p>
  <p>“Ouch!” said Ted, but in a manly way.</p>
  <p>“Talk to me about boots and Fascism, Ted” said Sylvia.</p>
  <p>“That hawk I were watching,” said Ted, “That's a Fascist.”</p>
  <p>“It's not wearing boots,” said Sylvia.</p>
  <p>She kissed Ted again, drawing more blood, and walked off to the cottage.</p>
  <p>Later, done with hawk-watching through binoculars, Ted joined her.</p>
  <p>“What's thee doing, lass?” he asked, gruffly.</p>
  <p>Sylvia looked up at him.</p>
  <p>“I am knitting boots for the hawk,” said Sylvia, in domestic bliss.</p>
  <p>Ted stared out of the window into the rain.</p>
