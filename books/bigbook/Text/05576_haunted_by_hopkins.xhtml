  <h1 id="post-5576">Haunted By Hopkins</h1>
  <p class="noindent">With my head still buried in tales by M P Shiel, I find myself wondering if our author was haunted by the spirit of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Rather like that wonderful game <strong><a href="05576_haunted_by_hopkins.xhtml" class="internal" title="Mr Key Is Transfixed">Cheese or Font?</a></strong>, one could ask, of certain short passages, Shiel or Hopkins?</p>
  <p>Consider the emboldened patch of this sentence, from the apocalyptically bonkers Shiel story <em>Vaila</em>:</p>
  <p>“As he lifted a latch the metal flew inward with instant impetuosity and swung him far, while <strong>a blast of the storm, braying and booming through the aperture with buccal and reboant bravura</strong>, caught and pinned me against an angle of the wall.”</p>
