  <p class="noindent">This week in <em><strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2012/03/some-key-apps/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></strong></em> I present a round-up of exciting new apps for those of you who carry about hand-held computerised devices.

If millions, or indeed billions of fatheads buy one of my apps, I shall not be complaining.</p>
