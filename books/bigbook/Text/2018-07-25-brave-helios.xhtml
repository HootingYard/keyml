  <h1 id="post-16574">Brave Helios!</h1>
  <p class="noindent">My apologies for the recent lack of potsages [sic] here at the Yard of Hooting. This has been occasioned my my inability to cope—either mentally or physically—with the damnable weather. Whatever happened to “overcast, with drizzle”? Instrad, I am battered and blinded by the sun—or, as the Moody Blues liked to call it, Brave Helios! Well, Brave Helios is an accur'd orb I would happily see blotted out, or wholly extinguished. I shall pray for rain, or, better, a howling blizzard,, and resume tippy-tapping when I am able.</p>
