    <p class="caption">This week over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/01/keys-cupboard-corrections-and-clarifications/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I am afraid I have had to issue a set of corrections and clarifications to <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2010/12/old-keys-almanacke/" class="external">Old Key's Almanacke</a></strong> for 2011. As I point out, the errors in the original were probably due to the wrong kind of ectoplasm on the line, the “line” in this case being an invisible thread strung between the corporeal world and the eldritch realms inhabited by the shade of Old Key himself.</p>
