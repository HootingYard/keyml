  <h1 id="post-4338">Important Announcement</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Here is an important auction announcement. This coming weekend, May the first and second, sees ResonanceFM's fundraising marathon. From noon to midnight on Saturday and Sunday a series of guests will be trooping into the studios offering delectable items to be snapped up in <em>live</em> auctions.</p>
  <p>Mr Key will be on air between 1.30 and 2.00 PM on Sunday, eliciting bids for a pair of uberrarities, the books <em>Derek The Dust Particle</em> and <em>Bring Me The Head Of Derek The Dust Particle!</em>, written by Perry Natal and illustrated by Frank Key, published two decades ago by Indelible Inc.</p>
  <p>So turn on, tune in, drop what you're doing, and bid as if your life depends on it. Resonance needs you, almost as much as you need Resonance.</p>
