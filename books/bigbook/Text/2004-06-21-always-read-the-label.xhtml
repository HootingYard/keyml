  <h1>Always Read the Label</h1>
  <p>This advice is always given on proprietary medicines, of course, but one ought to bear it in mind with other products too. What, I thought to myself, could possibly be more entertaining than watching a DVD of <em>The Sound Of Music</em> and choosing the Finnish language option? By God, I know how to enjoy myself. Imagine my chagrin, then, when I realised that only Suomi subtitles were available, not the soundtrack! I very nearly gnashed my teeth in despair. Sympathetic readers can look at this picture of some nuns while pondering my sorry plight.</p>
