  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“‘What are the processes?’ He eyed Herzog as though the man had been an ox, a dog or even some inanimate object, coldly and with narrow-lidded condescension… ‘In Notodden, Norway, they have firebrick furnaces, you understand, sir, with an alternating current of 5000 volts between water-cooled copper electrodes. The resulting arc is spread by powerful electro-magnets, so.’ And he illustrated with his eight acid-stained fingers. ‘Spread out like a disk or sphere of flame, of electric fire, you see.’ 'Yes, and what then?' demanded Flint, while his partner, forgetting now to smile, sat there by the window scrutinizing him. One saw, now, the terribly keen and prehensile intellect at work under the mask of assumed foppishness and jesting indifference.” — George Allan England, <em>The Air Trust</em></p>
