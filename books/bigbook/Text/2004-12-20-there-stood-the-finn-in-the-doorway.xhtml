  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“There stood the Finn in the doorway talking to his reindeer, although they were far away in the mountains. He barred the wolf's way, and threatened the bear with spells; and then he opened his skin sack, so that the storm howled and piped, and there was a swirl of ashes into the hut. And when all grew quiet again, the air was thick with yellow bumble-bees, which settled inside his furs, whilst he gabbled and mumbled and wagged his skull-like head.” — Jonas Lie, <em>Weird Tales From Northern Seas</em></p>
