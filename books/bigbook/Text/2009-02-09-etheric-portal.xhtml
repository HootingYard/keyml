  <h1 id="post-1739">Etheric Portal</h1>
  <p class="noindent">For quite some time now, ever since I had a revelatory picnicking experience in a muddy field, I have been on the lookout for a proper Etheric Portal featuring the Circle of Power. Thanks to the <em><strong><a href="http://counterknowledge.com/2009/02/radionics-%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%CB%9Csacred-esp-quantum-crystal-wizardry%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2-or-nonsense-you-decide/" class="external">Counterknowledge</a></strong></em> website, I have at last tracked one down. Doesn't it look <em>reliable</em>?</p>

  <p class="noindent">According to the blurb on the <em><strong><a href="http://www.higherpowertech.com/" class="external">Ultimate Metaphysical Power Tools</a></strong></em> website, this particular Etheric Portal is “Brand New: Psychotronic 8, Etheric Portal Plus Supreme, Version 3.0, FEATURING THE CIRCLE OF POWER. Now Made With New ULTIMATE Orgontek (Orgone Matrix Material)”.</p>
  <p>I found all those capital letters pretty exciting, and if you are sensible enough to go to the site, you will see lots and lots of bright colours too, making for a really braintastic visit. Here is the full spec of what must be the best Etheric Portal I've ever seen for sale:</p>
  <p>“This is the ultimate Psychotronic / Life Force Energy Enhanced Radionics / Psionics workstation, nothing even comes close to this powerful subtle etheric energy instrument.</p>
  <p>Featuring:</p>
  <p>The Circle Of Power, Version 3.0</p>
  <p>Variable-Capacitance Psychotronic / Radionic Tuner Control panels (2 Rad Cases 12 Dials each)</p>
  <p>Photon Light Force Energy Projector Box: Vogel Cut Crystal (double terminated, 12 sided) with Blue Light Beam Projecting through Crystal and Radiating the center Beamer Witness Plate with a high vibrational energy bath</p>
  <p>Scalar wave technology</p>
  <p>Magnetron Technology</p>
  <p>Life Force Energy Technology</p>
  <p>Vibrational Shape Wave Energy Patterns</p>
  <p>Sacred Geometry</p>
  <p>Crystal Power Technology</p>
  <p>Electronic Amplifier Module Transmitting System with 2 Transmitting Antenna</p>
  <p>Orgone E (Energy) Block Etheric Energy Projection System</p>
  <p>Sound Wave Input Feature</p>
  <p>Fixed and Variable Frequency Tuning System</p>
  <p>This amazing workstation features the upgraded and powerful etheric energy reactor the Circle Of Power, version 3.0, 5 years in the making its finally released to the public. Now you can do 8 operations simultaneous at one time for both your Trend/Remedy and or Target/Witness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Scalar wave technology combined with life force energy technology, Russian style Psychotronics, and Metaphysical Radionics makes this the most powerful Radionics / Psychotronic instrument available at this time.</p>
  <p>Finally a Radionics machine with enough etheric juice (fuel) to open a portal to other energy systems. The Psychotronic 8's CIRCLE OF POWER is a vortex of flowing universal energy or “chi”, it can be said that it is an etheric energy reactor in the subtle energy realms.”</p>
  <p>I was so mind-numbed (in a good way) by all this that I had to go and lie down, so I didn't explore the website thoroughly enough to gather how much it costs. As far as I recall, it says somewhere that it's “under $3,000”. Frankly, I wouldn't care if it was <em>over</em> $3,000—or over $30,000. I want one, and I want one now!</p>
