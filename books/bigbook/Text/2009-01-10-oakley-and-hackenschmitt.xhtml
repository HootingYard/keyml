  <h1>Oakley &amp; Hackenschmitt</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Five years ago today, when the Hooting Yard website was in its infancy, I posted this quotation from <em>The Daily Telegraph Book Of Obituaries</em>. It still makes me laugh.</p>
  <p>Sir Atholl Oakley (1900–1987) was a champion wrestler, an impresario of giants, organiser of “rugged holiday cruises” and an authority on <em>Lorna Doone</em>. His wrestling career began after he was beaten up by a gang of thugs. He built up his physique by drinking eleven pints of milk every day, a regimen designed by the giant wrestler Hackenschmitt, who later told Oakley that the quantity of milk prescribed was “a misprint”.</p>
