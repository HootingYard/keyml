  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“There was an interesting communication at, of all places, Salisbury railway station in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone to help my condition. Having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in <em>Other Tongues, Other Flesh</em> by George Hunt Williamson, with their complicated circuits, I felt unqualified to build one. The answer rapped back: 'Just build a simple cone of copper—that's not beyond you is it?' I sat up with a start—surely space people would not talk like that? But it jerked me out of my self-pity and I began a regular daily use of a cone which my father made from a piece of scrap sheet copper.” — Jimmy Goddard, <em>Cosmic Friends</em></p>
