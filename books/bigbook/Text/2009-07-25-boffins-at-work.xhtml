  <p class="noindent"><em>[Originally posted on Friday 24 July]</em></p>
  <p>Boffins are at work mucking about with the Hooting Yard website to ensure its continued gorgeousness for years to come. While they go poking and prodding around in its innards, you may note some hiccups. Fear not. As Julian of Norwich said, “all will be well, and all will be well, and every manner of thing will be well”.&nbsp; Very sensible woman, that Julian. Had a pet cat.</p>
