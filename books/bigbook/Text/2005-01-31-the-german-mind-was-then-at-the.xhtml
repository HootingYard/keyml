  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The German mind was then at the height of its emotional unrestraint… and it produced a new sect or religious distinction almost every day. Many of these sects came to Pennsylvania, where new small religious bodies sprang up among them after their arrival. Schwenkfelders, Tunkers, Labadists, New Born, New Mooners, Separatists, Zion's Brueder, Ronsdorfer, Inspired, Quietists, Gichtelians, Depellians, Mountain Men, River Brethren, Brinser Brethren, and the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness, are names which occur in the annals of the province.” — Sydney G Fisher, <em>The Quaker Colonies</em></p>
