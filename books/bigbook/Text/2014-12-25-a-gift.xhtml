  <p>Although it is not compulsory (yet) for devoted readers to shower Mr Key with gifts, it is certainly advisable. I was very pleased to find this lapel accoutrement in my Christmas sock, and would encourage all of you to spend the best part of 2015 considering carefully how you might demonstrate your fealty next time Yuletide comes around.</p>
