  <h1>G Is for Gabbitas</h1>
  <p>Episode seven in our daily serialisation of <em>The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet</em></p>
  <p>The Blodgett figure on the second and third floors of the House was known as Gabbitas, although this was not the name he had been born with. Like Blodgett, he had been in place for as long as anyone could remember. His nose ran. He was clumsy. His disposition was as bleak and unforgiving as Blodgett's. Gabbitas was astonishingly tall—almost seven and a half feet—and his eyes were permanently bloodshot. We shall meet with him again, you can count on it.</p>
