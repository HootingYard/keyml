  <h1 id="post-5573">Dead Priest At Two O’ Clock</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“The habit is now confirmed in me of spending the greater part of the day in sleep, while by night I wander far and wide through the city under the sedative influence of a tincture which has become necessary to my life. Such an existence of shadow is not without charm; nor, I think, could many minds be steadily subjected to its conditions without elevation, deepened awe. To travel alone with the Primordial cannot but be solemn. The moon is of the hue of the glow-worm; and Night of the sepulchre. Nux bore not less Thanatos than Hupnos, and the bitter tears of Isis redundulate to a flood. At three, if a cab rolls by, the sound has the augustness of thunder. Once, at two, near a corner, I came upon a priest, seated, dead, leering, his legs bent. One arm, supported on a knee, pointed with rigid accusing forefinger obliquely upward. By exact observation, I found that he indicated Betelgeux, the star <em>“a”</em> which shoulders the wet sword of Orion. He was hideously swollen, having perished of dropsy. Thus in all Supremes is a <em>grotesquerie</em>; and one of the sons of Night is—Buffo.”</p>
  <p>M P Shiel, <em>Xelucha</em> (1896)</p>
