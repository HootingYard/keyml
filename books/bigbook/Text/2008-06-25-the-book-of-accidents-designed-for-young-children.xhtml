  <h1 id="post-453">The Book Of Accidents Designed For Young Children</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Peacay, the onlie begetter of <a href="http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.com/" class="external"><strong>BibliOdyssey</strong></a>, draws my attention to the excellent <em>Book Of Accidents Designed For Young Children</em> (1831).</p>
  <p>I'm sure this must have been a set book for the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage. The anonymous author “conceives he cannot render a more important service to the rising generation and to parents, than by furnishing them with an account of the accidents to which Children, from their inexperience or carelessness, are liable. If generally studied it will save the lives of thousands, and relieve many families from the long and unavailing misery attendant on such occurrences”. Among the potential mishaps addressed in this invaluable book are Playing With Horses, Worrying Dogs, Scalded At The Table, Playing With Fire-Arms, Falling Out Of A Coach, and Troubling The Cook.</p>
  <p>There are some sample pages <a href="http://brblroom26.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/the-book-of-accidents/" class="external"><strong>here</strong></a>, where you will also find a link to the entire book online.</p>
