  <h1 id="post-6204">Ornithological Anniversary</h1>
  <p>Astonishingly, today is the <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/mar06.htm#2006-03-11-1" class="hootingyard">fifth anniversary</a></strong> of the publication of Blötzmann's historic bird psychology diagram. Ornithologists throughout the world will be celebrating this landmark in a manner only ornithologists can, that is, by gathering upon promontories peering at the sky while munching filberts.</p>

  <p>It is hard to put into words the earth-shuddering ramifications occasioned by Blötzmann's diagram. Certainly it has had immeasurable effects upon the way we puny humans apprehend our beakéd, wingéd, airborne pals. I for one am reduced to dribbling with joy that I no longer languish in bird-ignorance, as I sadly did until this day five long years ago.</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> Inexplicably, several errors crept into the reproduction of Blötzmann's diagram. The corrected version appears below, and will, again, loom larger should you click upon it.</p>
