  <h1 id="post-5855">128 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)</h1>
  <p class="noindent">It is that time of year when reader Mike Jennings, from his exile in a pompous land, supplies us with an update to his comprehensive Dobson bibliography. A further twenty-four pamphlets have been added to the earlier list, which you can find <strong><a href="" class="internal" title="104 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">here</a></strong>. Mr Jennings has once again applied those terrifying, and terrifyingly significant, Blötzmann Numbers. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, all the listed titles are currently out of print.</p>
