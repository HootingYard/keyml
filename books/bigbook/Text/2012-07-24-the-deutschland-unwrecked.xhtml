  <p>An eerie photograph arrives in the post from Salim Fadhley</p>

  <p>If you click to enlarge, you will see clearly that the name of this big ship is the <em>Deutschland</em>. Yet as we know, because Father Gerard Manley Hopkins SJ told us, the <em>Deutschland</em> was wrecked off the Kentish Knock on the morning of the seventh of December 1875. Five nuns were drowned! So could this be a ghost ship? And if we peer very very intently at the photo, can we see, there on deck, the Tall Nun? It is all very mysterious.</p>
