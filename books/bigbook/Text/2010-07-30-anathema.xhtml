  <h1 id="post-4893">Anathema</h1>
  <p>I don't know about you, but increasingly I find myself compelled to cast anathemas, often at bus stops, supermarkets, and other sites of close contact with one's fellow citizens. But getting the <em>tone</em> right can be the devil of a job. One wishes the curse to come across as neither deranged nor weedy, but rather as a considered, cogent, rational, searing, and—above all—unarguable response to the situation.</p>
  <p>How pleased I am, then, to have discovered this splendid outburst from Austin Osman Spare:</p>
  <p><em>“Your theology is a slime pit of gibberish become ethics. In your world where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity, everything ends miserably, besmirched with fratricidal blood.”</em></p>
  <p>It is from his book <em>Anathema Of Zos, A Sermon To The Hypocrites</em> (1927) which I am clearly going to have to read, possibly even learn by heart. Further reading <strong><a href="http://thebonesgolast.blogspot.com/p/about.html" class="external">here</a></strong> and, enticingly, the opportunity in a couple of months' time to see an <strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200162/the_cuming_museum/1607/temporary_exhibitions/3" class="external">exhibition</a></strong> of Spare's work.</p>
