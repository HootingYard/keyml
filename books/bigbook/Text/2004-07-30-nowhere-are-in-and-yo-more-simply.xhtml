  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Nowhere are In and Yo more simply and adequately imaged than in the vegetable kingdom. The trunk of a tree is Yo, its foliage, In; and in each stem and leaf the two are repeated. A calla, consisting of a single straight and rigid spadix embraced by a soft and tenderly curved spathe, affords an almost perfect expression of the characteristic differences between Yo and In.” — Claude Fayette Bragdon, <em>The Beautiful Necessity</em></p>
