  <blockquote>
    <p>There used to be a library cataloguing methodology called the Dewey Decimal System, which could result in books with enormously long references: A.832.102.098/67 might be an example. Instead, every book fanatic knows that the quaint, humane system used in the London Library is much clearer: all the interesting stuff is in Science and Miscellaneous and arranged alphabetically. Fruit Farming follows Flagellation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus Stephen Bayley, in the <strong><em><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/8317759/Decimalisation-Day-Forty-years-ago-we-lost-the-rich-and-beautiful-poetry-in-our-pockets.html" class="external">Telegraph</a></em></strong>, while bemoaning the decimalisation of our currency forty years ago. The London Library's idiosyncratic approach to cataloguing is indeed a thing of wonder, as the juxtaposition in this photograph shows.</p>
