  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“An ingenious Frenchman has invented and patented in England lately a machine called the Thanatophore, which I confidently recommend. It can be obtained from Messrs B S Williams, of Upper Holloway. The Thanatophore destroys every insect within reach of its vapour, excepting, curiously enough, scaly-bug. The machine may be obtained in different sizes through any good ironmonger.” — Frederick Boyle, <em>About Orchids</em></p>
