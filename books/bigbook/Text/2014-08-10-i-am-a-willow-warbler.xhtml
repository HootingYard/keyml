  <h1 id="post-12970">I Am A Willow Warbler</h1>
  <p>The willow warbler is a type of bird which warbles in willows. I am not a bird—obviously!—but I, too, have warbled in willows. It is a simple enough matter. What you do is locate a clump of willows, then wander into the midst of them, and start warbling. You can then describe yourself as a willow warbler, perhaps when, at a sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece, you are approached by a fellow guest who asks you what you do. “I am a willow warbler”, you can say, truthfully.</p>
  <p>Among the various definitions given for <em>warble</em> in the OED, the one I find particularly helpful is “To twitter, as a young bird; to make uncertain attempts at singing”. This is my kind of warbling, because, frankly, I cannot sing for toffee. But there is nothing to stop me making “uncertain attempts” at singing, in the midst of a clump of willows, whenever the mood takes me. And take me it often does!, to the point of mania.</p>
  <p>I have a varied repertoire of songs which I warble—or sing uncertainly—on my willowy jaunts. <em>Land Of Ladies</em> by the Brothers Johnson, <em>Vienna</em> by Ultravox, <em>Boom Bang-A-Bang</em> by Lulu, and <em>Nunc dimittis servum tuum</em> by The Toofles are among my favourites. I struggle with the words—and tunes—of all of them, but that is par for the course with warbling. Occasionally I am shot at by farmers.</p>
