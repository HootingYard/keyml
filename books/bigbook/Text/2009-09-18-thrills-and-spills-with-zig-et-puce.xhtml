  <h1>Thrills &amp; Spills With Zig Et Puce</h1>
  <p>Only six issues of the children's comic <em>Zig Et Puce</em> were ever published. Our correspondent Fatima Gilliblat has spent the last ten years writing a definitive study of this milestone in Latin tot literature. Here is an extract from her forthcoming book, a brief summary of the content of each issue.</p>

  <p><em>Zig Et Puce, Number One.</em> Zig steals eggs from the Mavis Nest. Puce whittles a stick. Zig glows like a lightbulb. Puce bangs a pan. Zig clocks off. Puce wears blue pyjamas.</p>
  <p><em>Zig Et Puce, Number Two.</em> Zig, in an extremity of barbarian anguish, pops a cig into a dovecote. Puce outbids a flapper at an auction. Zig melds tarp with gauze. Puce takes part in a testimonial match for a retiring football ace who now has but the one leg. Zig meets Tod. Puce murmurs, like the sea.</p>
  <p><em>Zig Et Puce, Number Three.</em> Zig crunches twigs underfoot as he stalks his quarry. Puce spies a window of opportunity. Zig goes to the gallows. Puce mucks about with currants. Zig looks like Eve Marie Saint in <em>On The Waterfront</em>. Puce reads Simone De Beauvoir in her American circumstance. Zig spits. Puce clanks.</p>
  <p><em>Zig Et Puce, Number Four.</em> Zig is embalmed within the tomb of a great but anonymous ancient Egyptian monkey god king. Puce blots her copybook. Zig has gum disease. Puce clings to the raft of the <em>Medusa</em>. Zig makes much of much that has not panned out as planned. Puce goes for the Bob Stokoe Memorial Bucket.</p>
  <p><em>Zig Et Puce, Number Five (the notorious banned issue).</em> Zig shows grit. Puce, in tumbling, dislodges the Buttons of Beb, which cascade down the mountainside and are scattered about the lanes of a village in a Swiss canton. Zig foots the bill. Puce goes rogue. Zig is in a ditch with Tod and a cup and an owl. Puce dissolves in water. Zig hails the chief. Puce watches <em>Cowards Bend The Knee, or The Blue Hands</em>, with Latin intertitles.</p>
  <p><em>Zig Et Puce, Number Six.</em> Zig milks a cow. Puce milks another cow. Zig pays a visit to the place where it goes “clunk!”. Puce keeps milking cows. Zig is a harbinger of harbours and binges. Puce milks more and more cows. Zig crashes upon the rocks, like the sea. Puce sashays along Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse. Zig whimpers. Puce bangs.</p>
