  <h1>The Crucial Importance of Topiary</h1>
  <p>Hooting Yard's roving reporter Velma Nebraska writes to inform me that early in the twentieth century, there was a topiarist active in England named, delightfully, William Cutbush. He is mentioned in the splendid <a class="external" href="http://www.frostatmidnight.co.uk">Topiary In The United Kingdom</a> site created by Anthony Blagg, who—quote—“lives in Worcestershire with his wife, shears and family of ever growing topiary”.</p>
  <p>Incidentally, a Google search for “famous topiarists” yielded a startling result—absolutely nil. What is the world coming to?</p>
