  <h1 id="post-14864">Mr Key At The Movies</h1>
  <p>There I was, thinking that my film career began (and, thus far, ended) with Miss Hathorn's splendid adaptation of <a href="https://vimeo.com/80218060" class="external"><em><strong>A Recipe For Gruel</strong></em></a> in 2014. But what is this I find, lurking in a remote corner of Het Internet? Why, it is a film entitled <em><strong><a href="http://www.endwellproductions.com/projects/social/index.html" class="external">Creekside Artists</a></strong></em>, made by Endwell Productions as long ago as 2006â€“7, the soundtrack of which is a direct recording of Mr Key babbling away on the radio about Dobson, Marigold Chew, squirrels, and seagulls. I had no idea this existed. I suppose it also counts as one of my rare forays into the world of <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/James-Beckett-Works-Constant-Interjections/dp/0615726283" class="external">ART.</a></strong></p>
