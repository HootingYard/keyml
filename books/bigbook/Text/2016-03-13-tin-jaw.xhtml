  <h1 id="post-14650">Tin Jaw</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I was intrigued to learn that the new president of the Land Formerly Known As Burma goes by the resounding name Tin Jaw. At least, that is how the BBC pronounces Htin Kyaw on the <em>Today</em> programme.</p>
  <p>Though I wish Mr Jaw no ill, past or present, I cannot help wishing that he personifies a spectacular variant of nominative determinism and that, at some point earlier in his life, he suffered a catastrophic injury to his face which led to him being surgically fitted with a tin jaw.</p>
  <p>A tin jaw is perhaps not as gritty and heroic as, say, an iron jaw, but it is a fine name for a head of state.</p>
