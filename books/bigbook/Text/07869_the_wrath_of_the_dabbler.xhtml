  <p class="noindent">This week in my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/12/caption-competition/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I present a caption competition with a twist. Those of you who can barely think straight due to your excitement at the continuing wonders of the Hooting Yard <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archives/category/advent-calendar" class="hootingyard">Advent Calendar</a></strong> will be pleased to learn that, having printed and cut out and pasted with glue to a sheet of cardboard one of the pictures which appeared earlier in the week, you will have an advantage over common or garden Dabbler readers. You will already be familiar with the photograph, and indeed with the caption. So get thee hence and devise your entry for a chance to win untold riches in gold.</p>
