  <h1 id="post-11025">Are You Being Savaged?</h1>
  <p class="noindent"><em>Are You Being Savaged?</em> was a popular television situation comedy in the 1970s. It was set in an eerie and mist-enshrouded forest clearing, where a cast of regular characters were attacked by a variety of wild beasts. Much of the humour derives from the attempts of the cast to fight off savage and blood-crazed panthers, lions, bears, etcetera, armed only with a tape measure.</p>
  <p>Among the show's memorable catchphrases were “Unhand me, you brute!”, “Eek! My windpipe has just been slashed by the razor-sharp claws of a wild hog!” and “Let's put the kettle on for a nice piping hot cup of tea”.</p>
  <p>Today DVD copies of the first two series are particularly popular with zoo monkeys.</p>
