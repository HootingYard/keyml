  <h1 id="post-15140">Further Plums</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Yesterday's <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-19th-january-2017/" class="external"><em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em></a></strong> on Resonance104.4FM contained further plum-based radiophonic frolics. Listen carefully. I expect there will be yet more of this next week, until I have exhausted plums and turn my attention to another fruit, or even a completely non-fruit-related topic.</p>
  <p>And don't forget that the lines are still open for our 2016 <strong><a href="15140_further_plums.xhtml" class="internal" title="Christmas Appeal 2016">Christmas Appeal,</a></strong> and will remain open untll 24 December.</p>
