  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Stealing a little to one side, and crouching against the dark hangings of the wall, I could see him in the faint light which dimly illuminated the hall, and then I discovered that my surmise was correct—Neranya was quietly at work. Curious to learn more, and knowing that only mischief could have been inspiring him, I sank into a thick robe on the floor and watched him. To my great astonishment Neranya was tearing off with his teeth the bag which served as his outer garment.” — W C Morrow, <em>The Ape, The Idiot, And Other People</em></p>
