  <p>Here is an eminent seismologist pointing at seismological data with a small stick, or possibly a pencil. Not only is this seismologist a key member of the splendidly-named <a class="external" href="http://geosurvey.state.co.us/Default.aspx?tabid=297">Colorado Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Council</a>, he is also Director of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Centre, based in Denver. I draw him to your attention for a particular reason. It was this seismologist who, after the Boxing Day tsunami, criticised the lack of an early warning system of tide gauges that could have saved thousands of lives. And his name is Waverly Person.</p>
