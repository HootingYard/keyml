  <h1 id="post-5021">Befuddled By Laundry</h1>
  <p>One of the more intriguing Sherlock Holmes cases <strong><a href="http://thedabbler-blog.blogspot.com/2010/08/keys-cupboard-glimpsed-cases-of.html" class="external">unrecorded by Dr Watson</a></strong> is the affair of the bogus laundry. It is mentioned in <em>The Adventure Of The Cardboard Box</em>, where Inspector Lestrade writes to Holmes:</p>
  <p><em>“He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy—something like Aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.”</em></p>
  <p>I suppose “laundry” here refers to the business establishment, to what we might today call a launderette, rather than to the stuff itself, cravats and sheets and shirts and socks etc. gathered in a hamper. But perhaps not. Given the wild fancies of Conan Doyle's imagination, either is possible.</p>
  <p>And, just as the word “laundry” is open to more than one interpretation, so is “model”. What are we to make of this, recently drawn to our attention by <strong><em><a href="http://backwatersman.wordpress.com/2010/08/08/nothing-sadder-than-a-pitch-with-no-square-grindleford/" class="external">Backwatersman</a></em></strong>?</p>

  <p>A model laundry? Abstracted, perhaps, from a model village like Bekonscot and left to fend for itself in a Derbyshire townlet? “Come, tinies, we are going on an outing to see the model laundry!” If the hampers of laundry in the model laundry are bogus, what then? What then?</p>
  <p>It is enough to give me <strong><a href="http://thedabbler-blog.blogspot.com/2010/08/keys-cupboard-swimming-in-head.html" class="external">a swimming in the head</a></strong>.</p>
