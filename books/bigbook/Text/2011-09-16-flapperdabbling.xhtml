  <p>You can read about one particular flapper, and a criminal flapper at that, in my cupboard this week at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/09/the-chump-and-the-flapper/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>. The flapper is accompanied in my tale by a chump (unillustrated).</p>
  <p>Ray Bradbury wrote a famous collection of short stories called <em>The Illustrated Man</em> (1951), made into a film (1969) starring Rod Steiger (1925–2002). Were Mr Steiger still with us, I think I would write to him suggesting he play a character called The Unillustrated Chump. This would not be an adaptation of <em>The Chump And The Flapper</em>, the story in today's Dabbler, but a wholly different work, based on the boiling frustrations of a chump who, try as he might, cannot get his likeness depicted by a single illustrator. Mr Steiger did boiling frustration very well, and though he may have had difficulty playing a chump—for he was the most unchumpish of men—his training in the Method would no doubt have stood him in good stead. Alas, it is not to be.</p>
