  <h1>More From The Midden</h1>
  <p>A further find in the <strong><a href="2012-04-17-on-mail-order-in-the-twentieth-century.xhtml" class="internal" title="On Mail Order In The Twentieth Century">paper-midden</a></strong>: a scrap dated 16th February 1992.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Yesterday I considered a string of words to form an alphabet, words beginning and ending a-b, b-c, c-d and so on. Let's see if I can remember it. Alb, basic, cod, drone, earmuff, flailing, garish, hoi-polloi, [imaj?], jack, kernel, loom, marzipan, no, orlop, [p-q], quiver, railings, squirt, tofu, [u-v], vow, wax, xerophilously, [y-z], zeugma. The idea is (after finding something for the missing wordsâ€”invented proper names if necessary) to write a story which mentions all those in order.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This story was never written, twenty years ago, but perhaps I shall apply myself to it now, or in the near future.</p>
