  <h1 id="post-14159">American Snipper</h1>
  <p>Following the success of his box-office hit <em><strong><a href="2015-02-01-american-snipe.xhtml" class="internal" title="American Snipe">American Snipe</a></strong></em>, about a killer bird, Clint Eastwood has announced his next project. Rather excitingly for all of us here at Hooting Yard, the octogenarian titan of cinema has bought the rights to the <strong><a href="2015-10-21-the-petula-clark-files.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Petula Clark Files">Petula</a></strong> <strong><a href="2015-10-22-the-petula-clark-project.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Petula Clark Project">Clark</a></strong> <strong><a href="2015-10-24-the-petula-clark-minefield.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Petula Clark Minefield">Trilogy</a></strong>. My understanding is that, rather than making a series of three films, Bourne-style, Mr Eastwood intends to compact the narrative into a single movie, entitled <em>American Snipper</em>. As this title indicates, the film will be a character study of the collector who originally snipped out of newspapers the Petula Clark cuttings. Thanks to Max Décharné, I am able to reproduce one such cutting here. (Click to enlarge.)</p>
