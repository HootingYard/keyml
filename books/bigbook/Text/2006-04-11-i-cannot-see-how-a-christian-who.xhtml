  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“I cannot see how a Christian, who has had a taste of 'angel's food', can relish the miserable trash contained in novels. The tendency of novel reading is most pernicious. It enervates the mental powers, and unfits them for close study and serious contemplation. It dissipates the mind, and creates a diseased imagination. It promotes a sickly sensibility, and renders its votaries unfit for the pursuits of real life. It is a great waste of time, and on this account alone may be regarded as sinful.” — Harvey Newcomb, <em>A Practical Directory For Young Christian Females</em></p>
