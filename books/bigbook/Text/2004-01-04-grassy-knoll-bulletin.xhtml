  <h1>Grassy Knoll Bulletin</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Today I was idly glancing through the Sunday morning television schedules, as I so rarely do, when I noticed something quite intriguing on Channel 5:</p>
  <p><em>6.35 Dappledown Farm. 7.00 The Save-Ums! 7.30 Oswald. 7.45 Make Way For Noddy. 8.00 The Book of Pooh.</em></p>
  <p>Sadly it was already past 7.30 by the time I read this, so I missed the programme, but how interesting that the channel throws in a fifteen-minute documentary about JFK's alleged assassin among all those children's shows. I fully expect in future weeks to see the slot filled with shows such as <em>Wilkes Booth</em>, <em>Princip</em>, <em>Sirhan</em> and <em>Tsafendas</em>.</p>
