  <p class="noindent">“<em>I would my father had made me a Hangman, when he made me a Stationer;</em> for we are call'd to Accompt for Other Men's Works, as well as for our Own. And one thing that's cast in our Dish, is the selling of <em>Translations</em>, so <em>Dog-Cheap</em>, that every <em>Sot</em> knows now as much as would formerly have made a Passable Doctor, and every <em>Nasty Groom</em>, and <em>Roguy Lacquay</em> is grown as familiar with <em>Homer, Virgil, Ovid</em>, as if 'twere <em>Robin the Devil; The Seven Champions; or a piece of George Withers</em>.</p>
  <p>“He would have talkt on, if a Devil had not stopt his Mouth with a Whiffe from a rowle of his own Papers, and Choak't him with the smoak on't. The Pestilent Fume would have dispatch't me too, if I had not got presently out of the reach on't. But I went on my way, saying, this to myself; If the <em>Book-seller</em> be thus Criminal, what will become of the <em>Author</em>!”</p>
  <p>Sir Roger L'Estrange, <em>The Visions Of Don Francisco De Quevedo Villegas</em> (1667)</p>
