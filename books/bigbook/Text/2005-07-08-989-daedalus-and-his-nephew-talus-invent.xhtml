  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“989. Daedalus and his nephew Talus invent the saw, the turning-lath, the wimble, the chip-ax, and other instruments of Carpenters and Joyners, and thereby give a beginning to those Arts in Europe. Daedalus also invented the making of Statues with their feet asunder, as if they walked.” — Isaac Newton, <em>The Chronology Of Ancient Kingdoms Amended</em></p>
