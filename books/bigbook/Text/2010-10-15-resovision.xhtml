  <p>Unlikely as it may seem, the first—and quite probably only—edition of your favourite television show of all time, <em>The Frank Key And Lepke B. Half-Hour</em> will be broadcast live, yes live!, on <strong><a href="http://www.livestream.com/resovision" class="external">ResoVision</a></strong> tomorrow (Saturday) at 2.30 PM UK time. Turn on, tune in, shovel snack foods down your gullet, furrow your brow, and <em>concentrate</em>. That is all I ask of you. God knows it is little enough, at least for the time being, pending inquiries, debriefings, further snacking opportunities, and hell freezing over.</p>
