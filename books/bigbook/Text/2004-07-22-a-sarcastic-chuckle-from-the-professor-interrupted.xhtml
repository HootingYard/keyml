  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“A sarcastic chuckle from the professor interrupted: “Don't try heroics, my friend. It is useless!” As Flannery cursed, the fiend turned to a metal cabinet on the wall beside his desk. He busied himself with glass tubes for a while, mad mutterings and chuckles falling from his throat in an unintelligible rumble of sound. Then, without looking at the reporter, he approached the girl, a large red pill on his outstretched palm. A lurid oath spewed from Arn Flannery's lips as he strained upward. Blind fury gave him the strength of a maniac.” — Lars Anderson, <em>The Yellow Curse</em></p>
