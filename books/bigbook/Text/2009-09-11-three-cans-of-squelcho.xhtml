  <h1>Three Cans Of Squelcho!</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Astute reader Roland Clare reminds me that the soft drink sloshed all over the canteen table by the narrator of <em><strong><a href="2009-09-10-impugned-by-a-peasant.xhtml" class="internal" title="Impugned By A Peasant">Impugned By A Peasant</a></strong></em> <strong><a href="2009-09-10-impugned-by-a-peasant.xhtml" class="internal" title="Impugned By A Peasant"></a></strong>was the subject of an Andy Warhol painting.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><em>Three Cans Of Squelcho!</em> (1966) recently fetched untold billions of dollars at auction. The buyer remained anonymous, though the word on the street<strong>*</strong> suggests the picture now hangs in the foetid lair of the Grunty Man, up in the hills. The Grunty Man has been a keen art collector for some centuries. If you look very, very carefully, you can spot him at the back of the auction scene in <em>North By Northwest</em>, where Roger O Thornhill (Cary Grant) confronts Philip Vandamm (James Mason) and causes a kerfuffle.</p>
  <p><strong>* NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> Blister Lane, apparently.</p>
