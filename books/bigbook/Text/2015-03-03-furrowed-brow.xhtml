  <p class="noindent">Yes, yes, I know there has been an unseemly silence at Hooting Yard for a while. There are a number of reasons for this, the only one of interest to you lot being that I have received the page proofs for <em>Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</em>, to be published (at last!) by Constable in September. This is my final opportunity to proofread the text of this classic reference work, so you can imagine your beloved Mr Key peering myopically at the pages, brow furrowed in concentration, trying not to dribble, and having to go and have a lie down in a darkened room every once in a while.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, for those of you suffering from Too Few Postages At Hooting Yard Mental Imbalance Syndrome, I ought, belatedly, to let you know that ResonanceFM is now uploading editions of the radio show on to its <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/" class="external">Mixcloud</a></strong> page almost as soon as they are broadcast. That link takes you to all the Resonance programsâ€”<strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/favorites/" class="external">this link</a></strong> is to the Hooting Yard shows currently online. (If it doesn't work, just search for Hooting Yard from the main page.) That should keep you occupied for the time being.</p>
  <p>Back soon, with unfurrowed brow.</p>
