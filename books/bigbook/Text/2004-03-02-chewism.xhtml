  <h1>Chewism</h1>
  <p>Chewism is the popular name for the fictional method pioneered by Marigold Chew (1955-1998). In her only book, <em>Six Hundred And Six Stories</em>, Chew demonstrated what she called “interstitial prose”: she would take an existing composition (from a bewildering variety of sources) and insert her own text in between each and every sentence of the original material. Sometimes the results were startling: the poet Gervase Beerpint, in one of his all too rare critical essays, said that Chew's story based upon a chapter from George Bernard Shaw's “nonage novel” <em>The Irrational Knot</em> was “as good as anything by Ayn Rand, and makes John Fowles read like a grumpy cod-mystic of limited talent”. (Inevitably, Beerpint received a grumpy letter from Fowles within days of the essay being published. Wisely, he cast it into a furnace.) As a special treat for Hooting Yard readers, we have gained permission to reprint one of Marigold Chew's uncollected stories, <em><a class="internal" href="2004-03-02-the-albatross.xhtml">The Albatross</a></em>, where her “interstices” appear within a short sketch of the same title by Augustus Earle which was included in <em>The Book of Enterprise &amp; Adventure; Being an Excitement to Reading for Young People</em> (London, 1851).</p>
