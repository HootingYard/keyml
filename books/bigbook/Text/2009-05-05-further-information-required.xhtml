  <p class="noindent">Alan Bristow, whose <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/may/05/obituary-alan-bristow" class="external">obituary</a></strong> appears in today's <em>Guardian</em>, was clearly quite a character. Here was a man who once threw Douglas Bader into a swimming pool (pity it wasn't a pond, I sighed) and called him a “tin-legged git”. I was particularly struck by one little detail, maddeningly not expanded upon, one of those asides that have you clamouring for more information.</p>
  <p><em>Bristow survived into old age to die at 85, just a decade after licensing for production a patent “water bed” for cows…</em></p>
  <p>What? What what what? It is sometimes said that Hooting Yard is “odd” or “wacky”, but the “real world” is infinitely more strange.</p>
