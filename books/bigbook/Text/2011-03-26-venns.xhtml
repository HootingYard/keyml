  <h1 id="post-6272">Venns</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I have been thinking of drawing a Venn diagram showing all possible Venns. There is John Venn himself, the in<em>venn</em>tor of the diagram, also notable for having built an automatic cricket-ball-bowling machine which was used to great effect in Cambridge in 1909 against a visiting Australian XI. There is red ochre-stained Diggory Venn, the reddleman from Hardy's <em>The Return Of The Native</em> (1878). And there is a hamlet in Saskatchewan called Venn which, in its glory days, had a wood crib grain elevator.</p>
  <p>There, that is three Venns to be going on with, sufficient for a diagram. Time to get the coloured pencils and paper!</p>
