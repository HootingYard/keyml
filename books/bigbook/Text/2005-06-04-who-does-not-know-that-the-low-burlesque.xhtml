  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Who does not know, that the low-burlesque word of Hocus-pocus, is an humorous corruption of their <em>Hoc est corpus meum</em>, by virtue of which, they make a God out of a vile wafer, and think it finely solved, by calling it a mystery, which, by the way is but another name for nonsense. Is there any thing amongst the savages half so absurd or so impious?” — Antoine Simon Maillard, <em>An Account Of The Customs And Manners Of The Micmakis And Maricheets Savage Nations, Now Dependent On The Government Of Cape-Breton</em></p>
