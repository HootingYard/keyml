  <h1 id="post-7207">Dead Or Out Of England</h1>
  <p>The splendid people at the increasingly essential <strong><em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/" class="external">Public Domain Review</a></em></strong> asked me to write a brief piece on a curious compilation of dog anecdotes published in 1895. You will of course drop everything to go and <strong><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2011/09/05/dog-stories-from-the-spectator/" class="external">read it</a></strong>, and when you do please pay particular attention to the author's apology, which I quote in full, and which contains the lovely line “the writers may be dead or out of England”, which somehow suggests that these are equivalent states. Perhaps they are.</p>
