  <h1>Queequeg</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Queequeg was a member of the crew of the Pequod, in <em>Moby-Dick, or; The Whale</em> by Herman Melville (Harper &amp; Brothers, New York, 1851). One of Queequeg's shipmates was, of course, Starbuck. It may be a tiny &amp; futile way of joining the anti-globalisation protest, but here at Hooting Yard we always refer to the hydra-headed coffee bar chain as <em>Queequeg's</em>. (We do not neglect the apostrophe.) Another amusement is to wrench as many anagrams as possible from the word <em>Starbucks</em>. <em>Burst sack</em> and <em>back truss</em> are pleasing, although for lovers of medieval musical instruments, and by cheating a little (adding the national designation <em>US</em>) it is possible to slurp your coffee at <em>Sackbuts R Us</em>.</p>
