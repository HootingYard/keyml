  <h1>The Cow &amp; Pins Redux</h1>
  <p>It pains me to say it, but a few readers are claiming that the <a href="2009-01-24-chucking-out-time-at-the-cow-and-pins.xhtml" class="internal" title="Chucking-Out Time At The Cow &amp; Pins"><strong>Cow &amp; Pins</strong></a> is a fictional tavern, a tavern simply made up by Mr Key for his own amusement. A “Facebook group”, whatever that might be, has been set up, called <em>The Cow &amp; Pins Is A Fictional Tavern, A Tavern Simply Made Up By Mr Key (Of The Hooting Yard) For His Own Amusement</em>, which, at the last count, had somewhere between three and thirty-five thousand six hundred and forty-six members. One can tell that the originators of this calumny are not true devotees, because they have made the elementary mistake of referring to “<em>The</em> Hooting Yard”, when of course it never attracts the definite article, never has and never will, so long as there is calcium in Mr Key's bones.</p>
  <p>Anyway, to prove these accusers wrong once and for all, here is a hyperrealist photograph of the Cow &amp; Pins inn sign, taken by Rex Hyper, the noted hyperrealist.</p>
