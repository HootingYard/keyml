  <h1 id="post-13393">Dream Report</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Last night I had a dream in which I met a young idiot savant who had committed to memory the entire contents of every single issue of <em>Reader's Digest</em> magazine.</p>
  <p>“Recite the story about the blue caravan that appeared in 1965 or thereabouts,” I said.</p>
  <p>Before he was able to do so, the dream veered off in another direction, alas.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTA BENE</strong>&nbsp;: For the correct placement of the apostrophe in the title of <em>Reader's Digest</em> magazine, see <strong><a href="2012-05-13-on-the-correct-placement-of-the-apostrophe-in-the-title-of-readers-digest-magazine.xhtml" class="internal" title="On The Correct Placement Of The Apostrophe In The Title Of Reader's Digest Magazine">this potsage</a></strong> [sic].</p>
