  <h1 id="post-263">Polish Tusk News</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Is it just me, or does <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7054912.stm" class="external">Donald Tusk</a> sound more like the protagonist of a contemporary American novel than the next Prime Minister of Poland? “Donald Tusk” could be a plutocrat in a fat Tom Wolfe paperback, or a sidekick of Oscar Crease in William Gaddis' superb <em>A Frolic Of His Own</em>.</p>
  <p>Mr Tusk's Civic Platform is likely to form a government in coalition with the Peasants' Party. Why haven't we got a Peasants' Party here? I'd vote for a peasant to be put in charge of things. Not a farmer, nor a Countryside Allianceista, but a proper peasant, in a smock, with a piece of straw in their mouth, and a stock of folk wisdom which I may well find incomprehensible. There must be a peasant called <a href="2007-10-17-the-reinvigoration-of-british-politics-in-three-easy-steps.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Reinvigoration Of British Politics In Three Easy Steps">Hoouhmne</a> who could be persuaded to run for office, the sort of Prime Minister who would award honours for the cultivation of <a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2007/10/best-in-show.html" class="external">Curiously Lumpen And Hirsute Root Vegetables</a> so that <a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com" class="external">Miss Hathorn</a> wouldn't have to strike her own medal.</p>
