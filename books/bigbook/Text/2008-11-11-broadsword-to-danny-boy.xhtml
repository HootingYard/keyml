  <h1 id="post-930">Broadsword To Danny Boy</h1>
  <p class="noindent">The Fire Wire has an amusing list of <strong><a href="http://larryfire.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/secret-service-code-names/" class="external">Secret Service codenames</a></strong> for American presidents and their nearest and dearest. Naturally, I am disappointed that neither “Broadsword” nor “Danny Boy” has been used, these of course being the codenames spectacularly en-un-cia-ted by Richard Burton (for himself and the great Michael Hordern) in <em>Where Eagles Dare</em> (1968). Still, at least I now know to refer to Richard Milhous Nixon as “Searchlight” in future.</p>
