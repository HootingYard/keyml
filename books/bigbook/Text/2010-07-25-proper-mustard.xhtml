  <h1 id="post-4831">Proper Mustard</h1>
  <p><strong><em><a href="http://brackenworld.blogspot.com/2010/07/mustardgate.html" class="external">A Very British Dude</a></em></strong> <strong>*</strong> explains proper mustard:</p>
  <p>“Listless and radioactive yellow, [American mustard] does not add to the celebration of all that is good and holy in your mouth. The “Actions on” ingesting Proper Mustard are as follows. Your sinuses should clear instantly; your brain should be invigorated and you should develop a nose bleed. English Mustard delivers and it is thus the correct Mustard.”</p>
  <p><strong>*</strong> I am charitably assuming this is a deliberate oxymoron. The alternative is too horrifying to contemplate.</p>
