  <h1 id="post-10639">Louise Brooks With An Owl On Her Head</h1>
  <p>Had she not died ten years ago, yesterday would have been the 105th birthday of Louise Brooks. To celebrate, the splendid <strong><em><a href="http://compendium-of-beasts.tumblr.com/" class="external">Bestiary</a></em></strong> posted a photograph of her with an owl on her head.</p>

  <p>At least I think it's an owl. <strong><a href="http://outaspaceman.blogspot.co.uk/" class="external">Outa_Spaceman</a></strong>, to whom I am once again indebted for alerting me to the snap, thinks it is either an owl or a hawk of some kind.</p>
