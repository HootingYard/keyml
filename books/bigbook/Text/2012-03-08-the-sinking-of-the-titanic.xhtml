  <h1 id="post-8553">The Sinking Of The Titanic</h1>
  <p class="noindent">An amusing letter in today's <strong><em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/mar/07/oppose-war-on-iran" class="external">Grauniad</a></em></strong>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Having written a piece of music based on the sinking of the Titanic, I might perhaps be lumped with the Titanoraks (Pass notes, G2, 5 March). Inevitably this 1969 piece is being performed several times this year. Recently a young Belgian composer contacted me to ask if his composition on the subject might be performed alongside mine in his country. His piece is written from the point of view of the iceberg.</p>
