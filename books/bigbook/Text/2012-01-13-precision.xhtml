  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Sebald's point, it seemed to me, was simple. That precision in writing fiction—especially in writing fiction—is an absolutely fundamental value. He summed up by saying that if you look carefully you can find problems in all writers, or almost all (Kafka being an exception; especially, he told us, if you look at the reports he wrote for the Workers' Accident Insurance Institute!).</p>
