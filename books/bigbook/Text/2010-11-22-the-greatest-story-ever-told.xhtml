  <h1>The Greatest Story Ever Told</h1>
  <p class="noindent">I must apologise for the dearth of decisive prose at Hooting Yard over the last while. At first I attributed the absence of fizzing sparks in my cranium to my becoming enwrapped in <strong><a href="2010-11-15-the-spell-of-shiel.xhtml" class="internal" title="The Spell Of Shiel">M P Shiel</a></strong>, but I am beginning to think there is another cause. My mind is haunted, haunted I tell you!, by the image of <strong><a href="2010-11-12-friendly-sea-creatures.xhtml" class="internal" title="Friendly Sea Creatures">those friendly porpoises</a></strong> pushing octogenarian surfboard man Dick Van Dyke safely to shore from his imperilment upon the sea. Is there <em>any</em> other subject worthy of the attentions of the writer of today? I think not. But then, how to treat, in mere prose, an incident that seems to me more and more numinous and mythic?</p>
  <p>No doubt I will shake off this sluggishness and return to the fray, but right now I feel hampered by my sheer inability to do justice to The Greatest Story Ever Told.</p>
