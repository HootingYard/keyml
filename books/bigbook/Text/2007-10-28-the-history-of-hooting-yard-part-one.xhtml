  <h1 id="post-270">The History Of Hooting Yard&nbsp;: Part One</h1>
  <p>It is twenty years since “Hooting Yard” first appeared in print. The words were tucked away in a squib of verse included in the 100-page pamphlet <em>Smooching With Istvan</em>, half of which was written by Mr Key and half by the estimable Max Décharné. Alas, like the complete <em>oeuvre</em> of Dobson, this Malice Aforethought Press publication is now decisively out of print.</p>
  <p>On page 96, we find the squib in question, entitled “Slab's Song”, the first verse of which is:</p>
  <p><em>The man with the hammers is Traitor Bill</em></p>
  <p><em>His flag is made of shoes</em></p>
  <p><em>He shut up shop in Hooting Yard</em></p>
  <p><em>And drowned himself in booze</em></p>
  <p>This was actually written a few years before 1987, but I can't recall when that might have been with any precision.</p>
