  <div class="verse">
  <p>Dear Bonkers Maisie, thou art so fair.<br />
  Blind beetles scuttle through your hair,<br />
  That unwashed tangle atop your head<br />
  Wherein's your brain, poisoned by lead.</p>

  <p>You breathed in oh so many fumes<br />
  And now the gleam of madness looms<br />
  Behind your eyes, or rather eye,<br />
  As you muck out the filthy pig sty.</p>

  <p>'Twas a pig took out the eye that's missing<br />
  When we were in the pig sty kissing<br />
  An idyll I shall ne'er forget.<br />
  The day was windy, cold, and wet.</p>

  <p>But all days are, in this rustic hell.<br />
  Oh Bonkers Maisie, my countryside belle!<br />
  They locked you up in the potting shed.<br />
  Poisoned by lead, poisoned by lead.</p>
