  <h1>Hooting Yard Archive, December 2004</h1>
  <p>Hooting Yard reaches its first birthday and celebrates with tales of wild pigs, vampire bats and days of imbecilic glee, as well as looking at the crucial importance of topiary, the legend of the Grunty Man, the Swiss Family Robinson, and, of course, what happened when Bj√∂rn and Benny and Anni-Frid and Agnetha were invited to Belshazzar's feast... Gosh!</p>
