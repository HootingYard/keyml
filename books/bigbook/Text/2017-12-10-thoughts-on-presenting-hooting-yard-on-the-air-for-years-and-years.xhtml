  <h1>Thoughts On Presenting <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> For Years &amp; Years</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="linebreaks noindent"><em>'Twas brillig, and I babbled guff</em><br />
    <em>Until my listeners cried “Enough!”</em><br />
    <em>And stopped my gob with a plug of dough</em><br />
    <em>And then it was that I knew woe.</em></p>
    <p class="linebreaks"><em>A woe such as I'd never known</em><br />
    <em>Not e'en when I was skin and bone</em><br />
    <em>In starveling days of pimply youth</em><br />
    <em>Before I grew so fat forsooth.</em></p>
    <p class="linebreaks"><em>Fat and loud and babbling guff,</em><br />
    <em>All roister doister swagger and puff,</em><br />
    <em>Puffed up like one of those eerie toads</em><br />
    <em>That leap at you from beside the roads.</em></p>
    <p class="linebreaks"><em>Well, at least, they leap at</em> moi.<br />
    <em>I wrote of them in my memoir,</em><br />
    <em>The text of which is what I brayed</em><br />
    <em>Hoping to make my listeners afraid.</em></p>
    <p class="linebreaks"><em>Instead they plugged my gob with dough</em><br />
    <em>And brought me down so very low</em><br />
    <em>That now my life is full of woe</em><br />
    <em>And it is time for me to go.</em></p>
    <p class="linebreaks"><em>Go where? To the seaside I suppose</em><br />
    <em>To my seaside chalet o' prose</em><br />
    <em>To thump my typewriter's leaden keys</em><br />
    <em>And write of hornets, wasps, and bees.</em></p>
