  <p>Gervase Beerpint's latest collection, <em>Chutney On My Spats &amp; Other Verses</em> will be published next week on Pansy Cradledew Day (26th March). Says Gervase of his new work: “This is a new direction for me. I used to write sat at my desk facing south, but these grandly poetic soul-emanations were composed in my temporary billet at an Antarctic weather station, so I couldn't help but look to the north, and that has been a wonderful inspiration. Mrs Gubbins has hailed it as my best work. What do you think of these tough reindeer-hide snow-boots I'm wearing? I think I cut quite a dash, don't you?”</p>
