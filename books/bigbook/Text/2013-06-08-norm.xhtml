  <h1 id="post-11574">Norm</h1>
  <p class="noindent">One would expect a person called Norm to conform to a norm, so it came as a surprise to me when I met someone called Norm whose conduct was anything but normal. Indeed, it was so far off what anybody might consider normal that I would happily sign an affidavit to the effect that Norm was absolutely bonkers.</p>
  <p>“Norm,” I said to Norm, some little while after making his acquaintance, and having witnessed a plethora of oddities, “It seems to me that your parents, when naming you, chose whatever the nominal opposite of the <em>mot juste</em> is. Whatever possessed them to dub you Norm? Were you, perhaps, normal as a babe in arms, only latterly striking out in wild and unhinged directions?”</p>
  <p>“Sigismund has unlatched his pig door,” said Norm, as he writhed within his straitjacket. You see what I mean? His reply made no sense whatsoever. He was a very trying companion. I am as loyal as the most loyal of puppies to my friends and acquaintances, but I think I might have broken things off with Norm, through sheer exasperation, were it not that I, too, was enswathed in a straitjacket, and shared with Norm the padded cell from which neither of us are ever likely to be released.</p>
