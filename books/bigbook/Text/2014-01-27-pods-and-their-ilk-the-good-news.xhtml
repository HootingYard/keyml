  <p>A number of readers and listeners have written to me on the subject of Hooting Yard podcasts, generally along the lines of “Oi, Mr Key! My life has become barren and empty and devoid of purpose and it is all your fault. Where once I could rely on weekly, or even twice-weekly, new Hooting Yard podcasts, nowadays they only turn up once in a blue moon. What in the name of heaven is going on?”</p>
  <p>I ought to explain that I am as bewildered as my correspondents. Once a week, more or less, I go to the Resonance studio and babble into a microphone for half an hour, live on air. How any of what I say eventually finds its way onto the ethereal mews and boulevards of Interwebshire has always been a profound mystery to me.</p>
  <p>However, I have good news for all those of you biting your pillows in despair. All episodes of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> are now uploaded, regularly and promptly, to the <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/resonance-fm/sets/hooting-yard" class="external">ResonanceFM Hooting Yard Soundcloud Archive</a></strong>. As I write, there are twenty-eight shows online, with which to siphon out your ears. Turn on, tune in, yelp with glee!</p>
