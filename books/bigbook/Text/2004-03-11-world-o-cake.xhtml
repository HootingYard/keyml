  <h1>World O' Cake</h1>
  <p>Yesterday was the birthday of long-time Hooting Yard reader Chris Atton. To celebrate the event, Dr Ruth Pastry has supplied two more pictures by Neville Main, onlie begetter of Mat and Nat, the ur-Istvan and ur-Zoltan whose cheery countenances were featured yesterday. Today we have a monkey cutting a birthday cake which is gobbled up by ducksâ€”that's something you don't see every day. (The captions suggest that the ducks only got the leftover crumbs, but I doubt it. Have you <em>seen</em> ducks eat?) The pictures are from <em>Jimmy Goes To A Birthday Party</em> (1950).</p>
