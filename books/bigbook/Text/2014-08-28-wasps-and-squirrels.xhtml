  <h1 id="post-13121">Wasps And Squirrels</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Hooting Yard's anagrammatist-in-residence, R., has alerted me to a non-anagrammatical matter of some importance. <strong>Winchester woman finds 3ft wasp nest on bed</strong>, says a <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-28949601" class="external">report</a></strong> on the BBC news page. As R. remarks, it is “disappointing that it's the extent of the nest, rather than the magnitude of a particular wasp, to which this headline refers”. I have read and reread the story, in the faint hope that R. misunderstood it and that there really is—or was—a 3ft wasp at large in Hampshire. It would make a terrific short story, wouldn't it? <em>As Mrs Gubbins awoke one morning from uneasy dreams she found herself transformed in her bed into a gigantic wasp</em>. Or has somebody already written something similar?</p>
  <p>Elsewhere at the BBC, I heard—in the woozy world between sleep and wakefulness—something about squirrels with leprosy. This was a report on <em>Farming Today</em> on Radio 4, a show I have come to think of as <em>Girly Farming Club</em>. The BBC seems forever to be wringing its hands at the under-representation of women, but <em>Farming Today</em> is produced and presented by an exclusively female team. Regrettably, however, not one of them sounds remotely like a proper peasant.</p>
