  <h1 id="post-13995">Incidents In The Life Of A Git</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Readers will know that from time to time I find inspiration from cryptic crosswords. For decades, it has been my daily habit to tackle the <em>Guardian</em> crossword, with occasional forays into those of other newspapers. Today I have been particularly impressed by 4 Across in the <em>Guardian</em>. The clue reads:</p>
  <p><strong>Incidents where git punches crusty things behind back of cafe (8)</strong></p>
  <p>I have not yet solved this, but while it is fresh in my mind I thought it useful to transcribe it here, mostly as an <em>aide memoire</em> to myself. You lot can look forward to an examination of such incidents in a forthcoming sweeping paragraph of majestic prose.</p>
