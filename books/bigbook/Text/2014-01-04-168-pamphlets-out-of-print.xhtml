  <h1>168 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)</h1>
  <p class="noindent">For the past several years, reader Mike Jennings has spent his time very usefully compiling a reliable list of the works of Dobson. Once a year, at around this time, he updates the list to include those pamphlets to which reference has been made in these pages during the previous twelvemonth. And bang on time, here he is with an additional eight titles. Each has appended to it one of those damnably clever Bl√∂tzmann numbers. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, these titles are out of print.</p>
