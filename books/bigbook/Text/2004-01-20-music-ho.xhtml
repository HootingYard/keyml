  <h1>Music Ho!</h1>
  <p>That wretched man Ben Elton has carved a career for himself writing appalling musicals, picking over rock music's back catalogues like a vulture over carrion—<em>We Will Rock You</em> based on Queen, <em>Tonight's The Night</em> on Rod Stewart, and so, gruesomely, on. Before London's theatreland chokes on this lethal diet, a corrective is clearly needed. Work needs to begin on <em>Bittern Storm Over Ülm</em>, <em>Pin Back Your Ears!</em> and <em>Perfume Bottle Atomiser Air Bulb Invention</em>, doing for Henry Cow, Charles Ives and Captain Beefheart &amp; The Magic Band what Elton has done for Mercury &amp; co and Stewart.</p>
