  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p class="noindent">“Four kinds of wild pigs are found. The most numerous, or at least the most often seen, as it lies about our enclosures, is the common thorn-hog. It is the largest of the wild pigs, long-bodied and flat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in which it wallows.” — Richard Jefferies, <em>After London</em></p>
