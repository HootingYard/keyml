  <h1 id="post-284">Nonsense?</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Apparently, I may have “written more nonsense than any other man living”, according to Sam Jordison in the online <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/11/im_talking_nonsense_in_a_good.html" class="external"><strong><em>Guardian</em></strong></a>. I'm pleased to note, however, that by the end of his article Mr Jordison acknowledges that Hooting Yard is a fundamentally sensible place, sober and reasoned and measured.</p>
  <p><strong>Addendum</strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; It occurs to me that a <em>Guardian</em> article is likely to lure many new readers here, some of whom will flit swiftly away but others who will become entranced and quite possibly spend the rest of their lives trawling through the Archives. To the latter, may I draw your attention to the Donation box on the right? All this prose is offered freely, I don't get paid, and I don't have a private income. I do need to keep a variety of wolves from my door. End of begging letter.</p>
