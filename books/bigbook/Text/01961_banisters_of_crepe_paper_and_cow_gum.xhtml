  <h1 id="post-1961">Banisters Of Crepe Paper And Cow Gum</h1>
  <p class="noindent">According to the old adage, “the best banisters are the sturdiest banisters”. There is a great deal of wisdom in this simple phrase, as many unsteady persons who may otherwise have toppled to their deaths can attest. But it is a saying which has been wilfully ignored by trendy banistermaker Tim Snap, who is peddling his latest design, a banister rail made of crepe paper thickened with cow gum. We sent a roving Hooting Yard reporter to interview Mr Snap.</p>
  <p><em>Reporter&nbsp;:</em> I am astonished to see you leaning insouciantly against your crepe paper and cow gum banisters, Tim, given they are all that stands between you and a yawning stairwell down which you could plunge to your death.</p>
  <p><em>Snap&nbsp;:</em> You should add, for the benefit of your readers, that I am leaning my full weight against the banisters.</p>
  <p><em>Reporter&nbsp;:</em> If you don't mind me saying so, Tim, you are quite a chubby banistermaker, so there must be quite a bit of weight for your banisters to support.</p>
  <p><em>Snap&nbsp;:</em> That is indeed so.</p>
  <p><em>Reporter&nbsp;:</em> If I were to give you a shove, in a joshing sort of manner, as between a couple of pals, would your banister withstand the added pressure suddenly put upon it?</p>
  <p><em>Snap&nbsp;:</em> I certainly hope so.</p>
  <p><em>Reporter&nbsp;:</em> Let's test it shall we?</p>
  <p><em>Snap&nbsp;:</em> Well, before you do, please note that this new banister rail, like all my banisters, is primarily decorative.</p>
  <p><em>Reporter&nbsp;:</em> Are you trying to wheedle your way out of my shoving test?</p>
  <p><em>Snap&nbsp;:</em> Quite frankly, yes.</p>
  <p><em>Reporter&nbsp;:</em> I think that tells us all we need to know.</p>
  <p>There is, you see, a point to those old adages, and a reason why they have survived. They express truths, both big and little truths. So when next you come upon a snaggle-toothed peasant sitting on a fence chewing a piece of straw and mumbling a litany of folk wisdom, do not dismiss what they say. Sometimes their sayings may seem to be blithering nonsense, as for example “A pig on the lane can cause you a sprain” or “When you see a door ajar, tug your forelock to the Master up at the Big House”. If you reflect for long enough even upon the most ludicrous-seeming utterance, you will eventually bow to its wisdom. And you will be much less likely to fork over your cash to a pretentious git like Tim Snap who, our reporter revealed, was supported over that vertiginous stairwell not by his crepe paper and cow gum banisters, but by a system of invisible winches and pulleys. Let that be a lesson to you.</p>
