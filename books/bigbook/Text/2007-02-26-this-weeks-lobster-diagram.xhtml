  <h1 id="post-81">This Week's Lobster Diagram</h1>
  <p>Untold numbers of Hooting Yard readers have been writing in with a single demand. <em>What we expect, Mr Key,</em> they all say, <em>is regular lobster diagrams! We know what we want and we want them weekly!</em> Whether this is a true reflection of the popular will or a sinister campaign to divert us from our important work I cannot say. As a sop to the protesters, however, here is a lobster diagram. You will note that it emphasises the location of the lobster's brain, which is, incidentally, the subject of Pebblehead's latest bestselling paperback, <em>The Location Of The Lobster's Brain</em>.</p>
