  <h1>An Eye for a Bargain</h1>
  <p>The story above mentions bargain price stationery. I came across a rather more enticing offer today, while reading the always-interesting <a class="external" href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/">Religion News Blog</a>.</p>
  <p>In my more puritanical moments, I have been known to declare that all advertising is hateful, and that this would be a far, far better world without it. Such pronouncements reckon without eBay, which appears to have infiltrated every cranny of the internet.</p>
  <p>There I was, browsing the Religion News Blog for further detail on the magnificent headline <em>Little Pebble Planned To Start ‘A New Race’</em>, when I noticed this, at the bottom of the page, tucked among the adverts:</p>
  <p class="editor">Priests&nbsp;: Quality new and used items. Search for priests now!&nbsp;: www.ebay.com</p>
  <p>That exclamation mark is priceless.</p>
