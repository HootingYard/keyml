  <h1 id="post-3892">Three Out Of Four Moptops</h1>
  <p>I have just started to read <em>The Killing Of Julia Wallace</em>, Jonathan Goodman's account of one of the twentieth century's most intriguing murder mysteries. The events took place in 1931, in Liverpool. Thirty-odd pages in, I have been struck by the following:</p>
  <p>One of the key locations is Menlove Avenue, the road where John Lennon grew up. The evening before the murder of his wife, William Herbert Wallace played chess with a man named McCartney, and on the day of the killing itself, he paid a visit to a Mrs Harrison. Alas, the index shows no sign of anyone called Starkey, or Starr. Still, three out of four loveable moptops is a pretty good tally so far as meaningless yet interesting coincidences go.</p>
