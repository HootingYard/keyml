  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“There are many in Paraguay who cherish dreams of discovering Jesuit mines. Humanity loves to deceive itself, although there are plenty ready to deceive it; and if men can both forge for themselves fables and at the same time damage their neighbours in so doing, their pleasure is intense” — R B Cunninghame-Graham, <em>A Vanished Arcadia: Being Some Account Of The Jesuits In Paraguay 1607 To 1767</em></p>
