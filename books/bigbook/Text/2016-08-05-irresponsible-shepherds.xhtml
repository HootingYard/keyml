  <h1 id="post-14789">Irresponsible Shepherds</h1>
  <p>“The problem is not the sheep. The problem is irresponsible shepherds.” Thus spake—on the radio this morning—a spokesman for the majestically-named Irresponsible Shepherding Task Force in the Forest of Dean. Apparently, that rustic paradise is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who, among sundry enormities, allow their sheep to bleat in the middle of the night.</p>
  <p>Personally, I am not surprised to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleating. Sheep are highly neurasthenic creatures who spend their entire lives in a state of fretfulness and nervous tension, and as a result they rarely sleep. This is probably one reason why, as has been observed by several country persons, a sheep's ambition in life is to die.</p>
