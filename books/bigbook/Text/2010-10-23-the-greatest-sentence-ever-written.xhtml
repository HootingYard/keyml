  <h1 id="post-5458">The Greatest Sentence Ever Written</h1>
  <p><strong><a href="http://nigeness.blogspot.com/2010/10/i-was-shadow-of-waxwing-slain.html" class="external">Nige</a></strong> has been rereading <em>Pale Fire</em>, and has inspired me to begin my own once-per-decade revisit to Vladimir Nabokov's most magnificent novel. Just as <em>Lolita</em> has the finest parenthetical phrase in all literature—<em>(picnic, lightning)</em> – so <em>Pale Fire</em> contains my absolute favourite sentence. If you have not yet read the book, you should look away now, as they say on television…</p>
  <p>In itself, the sentence is unremarkable. But in its context, its placement (at the end of the third paragraph of the Foreword), and its startling, joyous, vertiginous effect, it has no peer.</p>
  <p><em>There is a very loud amusement park right in front of my present lodgings.</em></p>
