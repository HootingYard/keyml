  <p class="noindent">I ought to have posted a Pietà yesterday, but events of the past few days have led me to leave Hooting Yard untended. First there was an eye test involving blurring-effect droppages, then a three-hour marathon radio broadcast as part of the <strong><a href="http://fundraiser.resonance.fm/" class="external">ResonanceFM fundraiser week</a></strong>, and certain other matters which I may go into at a later date. Onwards and upwards!</p>
