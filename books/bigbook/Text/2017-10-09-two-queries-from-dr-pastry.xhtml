  <p class="noindent">Ahoy there, Mr Key!, <em>writes Dr Ruth Pastry,</em> I very much enjoyed reading your piece <a href="2017-10-08-unspeakable.xhtml" class="internal" title="Unspeakable"><strong><em>Unspeakable</em></strong></a>. For me, the thunderclap moment was the mention of the <em>cravatteuse's</em> dog. I am sure I cannot be alone among your readers in hankering for more dog-detail. Would you, for example, be in possession of a picture of this fabled canine?</p>
  <p>On another matter, with reference to your piece <strong><a href="2017-10-04-hendiadys-in-mudchute.xhtml" class="internal" title="Hendiadys In Mudchute"><em>Hendiadys In Mudchute</em></a>,</strong> am I correct in thinking that there is a figure of speech, or it might be a disease of poultry, called chickendiadys?</p>
  <p>I look forward to hearing from you regarding both these riveting topics.</p>
