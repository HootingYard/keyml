  <p class="noindent">Here is a snap taken at Yada's restaurant in Peckham last night, where I did a reading as part of the LitCrawl festival. The photo was taken by one of my fellow-readers, Tony White, and also on the bill was Audrey Reynolds. I read a couple of stories and also took the opportunity to extol the many and various virtues of <em>Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</em>, waving a copy of the book at the audience and reading a couple of extracts. This, for example, provoked pleasingly immoderate laughter:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><strong>Scott, George R.</strong> (British poultry expert, 20th century). Scott was the author of the 1934 book <em>The Art Of Faking Exhibition Poultry</em>. In the introduction, Socrates, Galileo, Voltaire, Nietzsche and D. H. Lawrence are each called to support his attack on the despicable practice, nowhere more vile than in “the pseudo-scientific Hogan cult, with all its blowsy jargon; its crapulous fundament of snide anatomy; its noisy and prolific drool of whim-wham”.</p>
