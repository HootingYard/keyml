  <h1>I See The Chicken</h1>
  <p class="noindent">As you know, I am currently keeping my eye out for <strong><a href="2013-07-29-rustic-wisdom.xhtml" class="internal" title="Rustic Wisdom">chickens</a></strong>. Thanks, then, to Ruthie Bosch for sending me this snap of a chicken alongside a <em>smoking child</em>, from a century or so ago. I will probably receive a stern directive from some governmental agency insisting that I airbrush the gasper out of the photograph, but history is history. Weirdly, it seems that in the early twentieth century not everyone was in thrall to some kind of Blairite-Cameronian-Third-Way-Consensus, in spite of what the BBC tells us. (See <em>Lark Rise To Candleford</em>, and any other period drama.)</p>
