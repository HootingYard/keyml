  <h1 id="post-3963">Here Be Dragons</h1>
  <p>One can truncate it slightly, and omit the inverted commas, without altering the essential meaning. This is the best headline since that business about Blunkett and the cow:</p>
  <p><strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1253066/Norman-Tebbit-attacks-child-dressed-dragon-Chinese-New-Year.html" class="external">Norman Tebbit attacks child in dragon outfit</a></strong></p>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> Hmm. The <em>Daily Mail</em> has changed the headline on its story, thus making my truncation and omission comments meaningless. All I can say is that it's a good job I posted this version before it was lost.</p>
