  <p>This is the coat of arms of Cuxhaven:</p>

  <p>In Cuxhaven, there is a tower built of concrete which is inaccessible to the public, which means to you and me, as well as to native Cuxhavenites. The significance of this inaccessible Cuxhaven tower for denizens of Hooting Yard will become apparent quite soon.</p>
  <p>There is a beach at Cuxhaven, too, which is the setting for Pebblehead's bestselling paperback <em>The Beach At Cuxhaven</em>, which I wouldn't recommend, as it is a mere potboiler, with wooden characters, leaden imagery, and a pewter plot.</p>
