  <h1>Two Gunthers</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Gunther the Pipsqueak, who appears in the story entitled <em>Grebe</em> (Sunday 29th May) is not to be confused with another Gunther who is mentioned in one of my favourite lines from a television drama. It works best on screen, of course, rather than reproduced coldly on the page, but here it is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Nate: Hey, have a hydroponic raspberry. They're grown by a guy named Gunther who once slept with Stevie Nicks.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="editor">From episode two of the first series of <em>Six Feet Under</em>.</p>
