  <h1>A Short Break (Again)</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Things have been pretty quiet here at Hooting Yard, and they are going to be even quieter over the next few days as I head off for another jaunt in the cause of <strong><a href="2013-02-20-marginal-notes-and-poetic-mirrors.xhtml" class="internal" title="Marginal Notes And Poetic Mirrors">art</a></strong>. This will probably be the last one, at least for the foreseeable future, so when I return early next week I shall resume my usual practice of hunkering down in my Diogenesian Barrel of Reclusion and sending forth sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose to an eager, panting populace..</p>
