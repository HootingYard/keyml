  <h1 id="post-407">Thicket</h1>
  <p class="noindent">In a thicket, with a compass, I am thinking about blubber. I use blubber for my candles. I'm the captain of a whaler. Some use tallow, I use blubber. It gets smoky in my cabin. I'm not in my cabin now. As I said, I'm in a thicket. I'm on shore leave for a fortnight. I've been hiking with the devil. Satan left me in a thicket on the wild and windy moors. But I've got my trusty compass and my pipe clamped in my jaws. I am smoking in the thicket. I hope to see my whaler soon. Don't go hiking with the devil. Keep your compass in your pocket. I am thinking about blubber. Blubber is my candle light. It's a comfort in this thicket on the wild and windy moors to think of blubber candle light, for the devil trapped me in this thicket and it is a pitch black night.</p>
