  <h1>Quicklime and Orpin</h1>
  <p class="noindent">Having read very carefully last Wednesday's quotation from <em>Forty Centuries Of Ink</em> by David N Carvalho (see 18th August), reader Glyn Webster has decided to carry out an experiment:</p>
  <p><em>In my driveway</em>—he writes—<em>I have stacked a sheet of writing paper, a ball of cotton soaked in quicklime and orpin (calcium oxide and arsenic sesquisulphide) and a brick. I will examine it daily for any messages European readers of Hooting Yard may wish to send me. Procedure: write your message on the kerb in clear block capitals in saturn (lead—a fisherman's lead sinker will do, but pencil lead will not); kick that message hard four or five times, then park your car over it to apply a vice-like pressure.</em></p>
