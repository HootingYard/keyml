  <h1 id="post-12310">A Trip To The Vomitorium</h1>
  <p>Following the unseemly decision of Penguin Books to publish the maunderings of a has-been pop singer as a “Classic”, we now have the equally risible <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/22/hanif-kureishi-archive-acquired-british-library" class="external">sight</a></strong> of the British Library paying £100,000 for the collected scribblings and jottings of the hugely untalented writer Hanif Kureishi.</p>
  <p>“Kureishi said it was <em>important</em> that it was the British Library that looked after the archive”, apparently—my italics—thus winning this week's Self-Regarding Wanker Award.</p>
