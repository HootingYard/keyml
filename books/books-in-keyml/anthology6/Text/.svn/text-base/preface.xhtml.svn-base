  <h1>Mr Key's Prefatory Remarks</h1>

<p class="noindent">One day late in 2011 I came upon the word ‘perpilocution’, defined as ‘the art of expounding upon that of which one knows little or nothing’. Gosh!, I thought, that's what I've been doing for all these years on the Hooting Yard blog. Henceforth, in the unlikely event that I am invited to a sophisticated cocktail party, when asked what I do, I can reply, while leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece, “I am a perpilocutionist”.</p>

<p>At some point before the new year dawned, I determined to test out my perpilocutionary chops by the discipline of writing roughly a thousand words per day throughout 2012. I had made such plans for a daily blog before, but never succeeded in getting as far as the end of January. This time around, two things emboldened me. First, the liberty granted by the conscious act of perpilocution. Second, perhaps oddly, was the happy, if unoriginal, thought of deploying a standard format, beginning each title with the word ‘On’. I am not entirely clear why this serves to inspire me, but it does. Thus far—September—I have pretty much managed to stick to my plan. On several occasions I have posted on the blog resurrected pieces from the past, but not often.</p>

<p>For the present collection I have selected one hundred and eleven pieces written in the first half of the year. They appear here in the order they were written, save for Nos. 66–71, which have been arranged together because they form a coherent sequence.</p>

<p>The title is taken from Father Hopkins, of course, for three reasons. First, it reflects my writerly interest in—some might say obsession with—birds. Second, because the buckling of the windhover has some vague echo of what has been described as my ‘lopsided’ prose. Third, and most important, is the idea that, if ever I do get invited to that sophisticated cocktail party, I can say, in a booming voice, while leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece, “My latest book, <em>Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle!</em>…” I look forward to that.</p>

<p>The cover design is by Pansy Cradledew. As my muse, there is a sense in which all my books are dedicated to her. That being so, I like to take the opportunity to thank certain others by dedicating these paperback collections to them. So this book is for Glyn Webster.</p>
