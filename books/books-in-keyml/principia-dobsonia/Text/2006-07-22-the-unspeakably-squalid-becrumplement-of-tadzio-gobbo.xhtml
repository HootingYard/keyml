  <h1>The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement of Tadzio Gobbo</h1>
  <p>Intriguing news from the world of letters, where weedy poet Dennis Beerpint has turned his hand to a work of prose fiction. We have received a review copy of the novel, entitled <em>The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo</em>, presumably on the basis that we will give it a favourable notice and thus boost Mr Beerpint's bank balance, albeit flimsily.</p>
  <p>“An immense mass of clotted nonsense”. That was the verdict of the magazine <em>Teachers' World</em> upon the first publication of <em>Ulysses</em> by James Joyce, and I am tempted to say the same about this Beerpint book, and leave it at that. Astonishingly, however, this thousand-page tome has already been made a set book for schools, colleges, and orphanages throughout the land, which means that your tots, if you have any, or you, if you are a tot, will have to become familiar with it. When examination time comes round, everyone's knowledge of Dennis Beerpint's fictional farrago will be tested to the full. And so, public-spirited as ever, I am going to try to save you from wasting your precious time actually reading the damn thing, by telling you what you need to know.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Plot</em>&nbsp;: Tadzio Gobbo is a princeling in a fictional Renaissance city state, clearly meant to remind us of the setting of a Jacobean drama such as <em>The Courier's Tragedy</em> by Richard Wharfinger. As the novel opens, Gobbo is pristine, even, and uncreased. “If he were a piece of cardboard,” writes Beerpint, “he would not be of the corrugated kind.” Chapter by chapter we watch as the princeling becomes ever more becrumpled in a variety of unspeakably squalid ways, until at the end there is a <em>deus ex machina</em> and he is unfolded and ironed out.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Characters</em>&nbsp;: Tadzio Gobbo is a crude self-portrait of the author, sharing his weediness, neurasthenia, predilection for twee verse, and hypochondria. Many of his becrumplements are accompanied by the onset of an imagined disease, such as yaws, the bindings, ague, flux, black bile, bitter colic and the strangury. Beerpint attempts to play up a certain devil-may-care foppishness, but this is never convincing. In fact it is laughably inept.</p>
  <p>There is a host of secondary characters, the most important being Lugubrio, the princeling's mad, stiletto-wielding uncle. Beerpint is constantly harping on about his “frantic black eyebrows”, which soon becomes tiresome. Lugubrio's sole motive for all his actions, from eating his breakfast to murdering a crippled beggar, is revenge, but what or whom he is avenging is never made clear to the reader.</p>
  <p>Other characters in the novel are a mixture of fictional, legendary, and real historical figures. Among the latter are Anthony Burgess, Edward G Robinson, Emily Dickinson, L Ron Hubbard and Veronica Lake. Beerpint thinks he is being clever by setting some of the scenes in a so-called ‘Scientology tent’ on the banks of ‘Lake Veronica’, but the effect is simply witless, and the reader will struggle not to throw the book into the fireplace.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Imagery</em>&nbsp;: As a poet, Beerpint has been praised for his imagery (although I cannot think why) and <em>The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo</em> is jam-packed with all his old favourites. Crows, cows, burnt toast, pencil-cases, weather systems, the blood-spotted handkerchief of a tuberculosis patient, chaffinches, hedgerows, the horn of plenty and the Garden of Gethsemane, mud, chutes, Mudchute, potato recipes and pastry fillings, starlings, pigs, more starlings, more pigs, a nightmarish albino hen and the Munich Air Disaster are all evoked at one time or another in imagistic ways, as the princeling become ever further becrumpled.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Does the book have heft?</em>&nbsp;: Yes it does.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Structure</em>&nbsp;: The book is divided into forty nine chapters, fairly uniform in length. Each chapter ends with a reminder, as if the reader needed one, that a further stage of unspeakably squalid becrumplement has taken place, except for the last chapter, to which I have already referred. Beerpint is clearly fond of the practice found in the picaresque novel of summarising the plot in his chapter headings. To take a random example, Chapter XXVI is titled: “In which the becrumpling of Tadzio Gobbo proceeds apace, as his mad uncle Lugubrio unleashes a swarm of killer bees into the sports arena during a wrestling contest, and a false eclipse of the sun leads to rioting and flux; together with some notes on the flocking of chaffinches and the nesting habits of starlings, an aside in which a missing punctuation mark spells doom for an apothecary, and the reappearance of Lugubrio's lobster.”</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Plagiarism or quotations</em>&nbsp;: Certain passages in the book appear to have been copied verbatim from novels by Barbara Taylor Bradford, Elias Canetti, Dan Brown, and the sociopathic ex-jailbird Jeffrey Archer. Dennis Beerpint presumably considers this to be postmodernist irony, a dangerous medical condition best treated by having one's brain sluiced out with a violent purgative.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Narrative sloppiness</em>&nbsp;: Untold oodles of it. It is a sloppy, flabby and slapdash book from first to last. At its core is a burning jewel of flummery and poppycock.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Brow</em>&nbsp;: Neither high, middle, nor low. Not even no-brow. This book's brow is frantic and black (see above).</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Bookcase location</em>&nbsp;: Finding the right spot for this volume on your bookcase or bookshelf is likely to be fraught with difficulty. Dobson's invaluable pamphlet on the shelving of books, which is sadly out of print, will not help you, even if you manage to track down a copy, for as the titanic pamphleteer readily admits, “There are certain books, especially those written by twee poets such as Dennis Beerpint, which resist proper shelving on even the most well-ordered of bookcases. Top left corner? No. Squeezed in among the drivel and tat on the bottom shelf? Hardly. Shoved behind the collected works of Edward Upward and quietly forgotten? Certainly not, because you will always remember that it is there, and its hidden presence will reproach you every time you go anywhere near the bookcase, and you will be as the lowest worm or beetle or that which creepeth on its belly in the foulest muck of the earth.” Maddeningly, Dobson goes no further, he leaves us in the lurch, he refuses to say what I think he means—set fire to the damn thing in your garden, just as Burgess biographer Roger Lewis was tempted to do with a rival <em>Life</em> of the absurd Mancunian polymath.</p>
<hr/>
  <p><em>Marketing ploy</em>&nbsp;: Each copy of <em>The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo</em> comes with a free gift, <em>viz</em>. a paper bag of badger food. For that reason alone, I recommend that you buy a copy at once.</p>
