  <h1 id="post-150">First Lines</h1>
  <p>In a piece on the <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/05/who_cares_about_ann_quin.html" class="external">Guardian Books Blog</a>, Lee Rourke identifies “the greatest first line of any novel I have ever read”, the opening of Ann Quin's <em>Berg</em>: “A man called Berg, who changed his name to Greb, came to a seaside town intending to kill his father . . .” Some of the commenters propose their own favourite first lines, and one links to a list of the “hundred best” from a website called <a href="http://www.litline.org/ABR/100bestfirstlines.html" class="external">LitLine</a>. There is no explanation of how the hundred were selected, or by whom, but it makes for an occasionally intriguing read.</p>
  <p>I had been thinking of compiling a list of the hundred best opening lines from out of print pamphlets by Dobson, and maybe one day I will do so. Certainly near the top of the list would be “There was a thunderstorm, and I discovered I had mislaid my bus pass” from <em>How I Mislaid My Bus Pass During A Thunderstorm</em>.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, having managed to type a couple of paragraphs while wheezing and spluttering due to my fever-racked condition, I am going to reward myself with <a href="http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com" class="external">A Nice Cup Of Tea And A Sit Down</a>.</p>
