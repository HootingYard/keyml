  <h1>The Spangles Reference Library</h1>
  <p>The reference library in Spangles, mentioned in the enthralling serial <a class="hootingyard" href="https://hootingyard.github.io/Text/2004-06-21-unspeakable-desolation-pouring-down-from-the-stars-contents.html"><em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em></a>, is, as far as I know, the only library in the world to hold a complete run of Dobson's short-lived periodical <em>A Lantern In The Pit</em>. The <em>Lantern</em>, as it was known, was a bold attempt to shed Dobsonian light on various intractable questions, chiefly of a philosophical bent. For some unknown reason, the pamphleteer-turned-journalist chose to compose most of the contents in a so-called <em>ur-lingua</em> of his own devising. He provided no translations, and all the papers relating to what he hoped would become a new universal language were destroyed in the Potato Building fire. We are left with seven fat issues of the magazine, densely packed with text which is—and, one assumes, will remain—devoid of meaning. Various cryptographers have at one time or another tried to crack Dobson's code, but most of them have given up when they discovered that no one would pay them. Here is a mercifully brief extract, from Volume 2, Number 1:</p>
  <blockquote>
