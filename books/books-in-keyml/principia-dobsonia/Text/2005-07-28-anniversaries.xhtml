  <h1>Anniversaries</h1>
  <p>Regular readers know that here at Hooting Yard we like to keep abreast of important doings in the world of petulant Canadian pop songstresses. That being so, it did not escape our attention that a new acoustic version of <em>Jagged Little Pill</em> by Alanis Morissette is being issued as a “ten year anniversary commemorative edition”.</p>
  <p>Next year will see the twentieth anniversary of the publication of two ground-breaking books, <em>Stab Your Employer</em> and <em>Smooching With Istvan</em>. These were early collaborations between Max Décharné and Frank Key and are, just like Dobson's pamphlets, sadly out of print. Following Ms Morissette's example, I think that twentieth anniversary commemorative acoustic editions would be a splendid idea. I know what you're thinking—these were written works, not musical ones. Hell, we won't let that stop us! Max and I have already arranged for a series of meetings to thrash out the details of the project.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, admirers of the woman Johnny Esposito calls “Her Shrillness”, if there are any, ought to visit the <a class="external" href="http://www.brunching.com/alanislyrics.html">Alanis Morissette Random Lyrics Generator</a>.</p>
