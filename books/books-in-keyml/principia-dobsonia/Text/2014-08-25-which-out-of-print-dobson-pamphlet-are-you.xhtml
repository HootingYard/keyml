  <div class="blockparagraphs">
  <p>This potsage [sic] has been removed because:</p>
  <p>(a) The Dobson estate slapped me with a cease-and-desist order</p>
  <p>(b) There are far too many out of print Dobson pamphlets to choose from</p>
  <p>(c) I haven't got the faintest idea how to replicate the format of those immensely irritating quizzes that have spread across Het Internet like an ague</p>
  <p>(d) All of the above</p>
  <p>(e) None of the above</p>
