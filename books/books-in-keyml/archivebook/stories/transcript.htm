<p><font size="+2"><b>TRANSCRIPT OF A DICTAPHONE RECORDING MADE BY DOBSON AT THE 
  1955 FESTIVAL OF ARGUMENTATIVE MUSIC IN ÜLM</b></font></p>
<p> <font size="+1">[Uncanny and repetitive metallic banging noises, as if from 
  the maw of Hell.] Ick… Ack… Ülm. According to the programme, this racket must 
  be an ensemble called "Brouhaha" playing a piece called <i>Tiny moths, ah! gossamer 
  wings</i>. I suppose that's meant to be ironic in some way. Either that or it's 
  a mistranslation - after all, they're Hungarians. And so many of them! I counted 
  forty, but then more appeared with hammers and other ironmongery. And they all 
  bear a faint resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Maybe "Brouhaha" is one big family. 
  I will have to check. This piece has been going on for over an hour and they 
  look as if they're just warming up. God help us. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Now that was more like it. I've just finished watching Fleur 
  & Primrose, much more conducive to my tastes. Fleur played pocket cornet and 
  Primrose played tack piano. Instrumentals, mostly, with a sort of valiant carelessness. 
  I don't think any of the pieces lasted more than 45 seconds. The last number 
  was strange. They were joined by someone called Dennis, who shouted things. 
  I think he was reading from a list of water polo cup tie results. Matchless!

<p><font size="+1">I really don't know what I'm doing here. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It's three hours since I last recorded. I've just come back 
  on the bus from the Ülm Swimming Pool, Lido and Marina complex, where parts 
  of the Festival are taking place. I went over there to hear the big event everyone 
  has been talking about - the premiere of Binder's <i>Concerto For Medicine Balls, 
  Blood Oranges & Canoe</i>. I assumed it was going to be an electronic piece, 
  but no, it was all natural, unamplified sound, and somehow it had an astonishing 
  Monteverdiesque resonance which is hard to explain. It was visually exciting 
  too, as all the players were wearing hideous orange jump-suits. I'm sure I saw 
  Primrose in the melée somewhere, without her tack piano sadly. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Edit.] </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next up is something called "Big Flugelhorn Mayhem In The Northern 
  Territories Disputed By Goat Boy And His Whelk Farm Hard Hat Orchestra". I think 
  I'll give it a miss. </font></p>
