<p><b><font size="+1">A BRIEF NOTE ABOUT PILLS</font></b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Please do not confuse toad-pills - those &quot;tiny pink miracles 
  of batrachian well-being&quot; as Dobson called them in his engaging pamphlet 
  <i>How I Counted All The Toads In Scandinavia </i>(out of print) - with other 
  sorts of pills, not least those of Lockyer, whose tomb in Southwark Cathedral 
  commemorates his genius:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here Lockyer lies interr'd, enough : his name</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Speaks one hath few competitors in fame ;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A Name soe Great soe Generall'e may scorne</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Inscriptions wh doe vulgar tombs adorne :</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A diminution to write in verse</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">His eulogies wh most men's mouths rehearse.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">His virtues and his PILLS are so well known,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That envy can't confine them under stone.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But they'll survive his dust and not expire</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Till all things else at th'universall fire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him safe</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To future times without an Epitaph :</font></p>
