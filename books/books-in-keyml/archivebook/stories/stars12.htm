<p><font size="+1"><b>CHAPTER TWELVE </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I SUPPOSE IT WAS stupid of me to expect Scrimgeour to answer 
  the telephone himself: he was, after all, staying as a guest with one or other 
  offshoot of his family. Nonetheless, I was disconcerted when the voice at the 
  other end of the line yapped at me in a foreign tongue. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Er, I'd like to speak to Agamemnon Scrimgeour, please," I 
  said, as politely as I know how. The voice said something like "ick" or "ack", 
  so, after clearing my throat, I repeated my request. There was a sort of scuffling 
  at the other end, followed by what I could only imagine to be the racket made 
  by a flock of auks being hosed down by a powerful jet of water. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello?" I said. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello?" This new voice was an almost inaudible croak: it was 
  not Scrimgeour. Once again I asked to speak to him. There was a long silence, 
  although it was clear that the croaker was still there, hanging on to the phone, 
  breathing rather heavily. I let half a minute pass before prompting him, or 
  her. Or, knowing Scrimgeour's family, it. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Are you there?" I asked, loudly, as if I were acting in a 
  bad play. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello?" the croaker recroaked. I sensed that this conversation 
  was going to last a long time, and decided to make myself comfortable. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Wait there," I commanded. The previous week, for reasons best 
  known to herself, my mother had had the house's one telephone removed to a damp, 
  bare room no bigger than a cupboard, accessible only by clambering through the 
  jungle of gigantic, spiny, poisonous foliage which she thought of as her "conservatory". 
  Peering out of the telephone room into the dripping heat, I wondered where I 
  might find a couple of cushions or pillows upon which to recline. I resolved 
  to head west, towards the long-abandoned nursery. Before I did so, I picked 
  up the telephone again. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Wait," I repeated, "I'll be back in a couple of minutes." 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In truth, some five or six minutes elapsed during my foray 
  to the nursery, in which time I incurred a variety of scrapes, scratches and 
  lacerations from mama's specimens of gruesome flora. Sweat was pouring off me 
  as I collapsed back into the dingy confines of the telephone room, and I dared 
  not dwell upon the maladies to which I would succumb as deadly plant-poisons 
  worked their way into my bloodstream. Hurling my armful of nursery cushions 
  on to the floor, I sank down on them, and picked up the receiver. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I'm back," I announced. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ick?" came the reply. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Get me Agamemnon Scrimgeour at once!" I cried, "Tell him it's 
  a matter of life and death!" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ack?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hm. The croaker had obviously given up on me. He, she, or it 
  had at least spoken my own language. I tried out a variety of phrases designed 
  to impress upon my interlocutor that I wished to speak to "the croaking one". 
  Eventually, at my umpteenth attempt, something worked. There was a final "ick", 
  another scuffle, further dousing of auks, and, at last, a different and intelligible 
  voice, a new one again, urgent and interrogatory. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello? Hello? Hello?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ah, hello," I replied, all suave, "May I speak to Agamemnon 
  Scrimgeour please?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Which one?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"What?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Which Agamemnon Scrimgeour do you wish to speak to?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had had many long talks with Scrimgeour about his family, 
  but he had never let drop that he shared his cognomen with another. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I didn't know there were two of them," I said. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Actually, there are eight," came the reply, "Of whom I am 
  one. Now, which one is it you wish to speak to?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Eight Agamemnons in one family? It didn't bear thinking about. 
  I was so startled that I had difficulty summoning up any distinguishing features 
  of the Agamemnon I knew. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ah," I said at last, "The one with a metal plate in his skull." 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There was a pause. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"That narrows it down to five of us. At least we have established 
  that you do not wish to speak to me." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I thought for a moment. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"My name is Zoltan Mingbike," I said, using another anagram, 
  but one with which I knew Scrimgeour - my Scrimgeour - would be familiar, "He 
  works for me." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Wait there," said the Scrimgeour at the other end. I plumped 
  up my cushions and wished I had brought a hefty bottle of Fin de Siecle Moustachio 
  with me. A minute or two later, the Scrimgeour was back. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"There are four Agamemnon Scrimgeours here who claim to work 
  for someone using your name," he said, "Three of whom have metal plates in their 
  skulls." I was astounded. "We're getting there," he continued, encouragingly. 
  I think I have mentioned earlier that my patience is inhuman. However. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Now look here!" I yelled, "I cannot believe that Zoltan Mingbikes 
  are as common as, as, as Agawhatever Scrimgeours, let alone that they all seem 
  to work for each other! Stop your piddling and get me Scrimgeour this instant!" 
  This was an ill-measured little outburst, as I now realise, and did me not one 
  whit of good with the Scrimgeour to whom I was speaking. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"If, sirrah, you wish to speak to Agamemnon Scrimgeour," he 
  said, "You would do well not to give vent to such rudery. I shall give you ten 
  seconds. If, in that time, you have not apologised, I shall hang up." Such was 
  my frazzlement that I let nine seconds elapse before, sheepishly, I blathered 
  a few sorry mumblings. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Very well. Thank you," said Agamemnon Scrimgeour. "Let us 
  proceed. We are down to a shortlist of three. What else can you tell me about 
  the Agamemnon you wish to speak to?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"He has a crestfallen air about him." There was a sound of 
  wry chuckling from the other end. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Oh, so have we all," said the Scrimgeour, "So have we all. 
  It's a family trait." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I see," I replied, chastened, "Um. I live in a large mansion 
  on the coast. Agamemnon helps me to care for a shattered retainer named Mister 
  Patch. We sometimes play ping-pong of an afternoon." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Yes?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Well isn't that enough?" I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Do you know his middle name, shoe size, or the width of his 
  girth?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Eh?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Has he had pulmonary thrombosis?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"What?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I'm sorry. I was codding you. Wait a moment and I'll get him." 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While I waited I picked my teeth. After an age, the same bloody 
  Scrimgeour returned to the telephone. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Yes yes yes?" I rapped. What was the problem now? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I'm afraid your Agamemnon has had a little accident," he said, 
  "Apparently, he got trapped in a wind tunnel this morning, and has become temporarily 
  deaf." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was having none of this. Larding my tones with pomposity, 
  I suggested to the speaker that he could act as an intermediary: his role would 
  be to communicate my words to Agamemnon by sign language, or by writing them 
  down, and, by reversing the process, give me the other side of the conversation. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hm," he replied after a pause, "I'm afraid that won't be possible. 
  Your Agamemnon is abed, bandaged and sedated. You see, trapped with him in the 
  wind tunnel was an enormous bittern which, in its panic, injured him rather 
  badly." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Well, is he half-way conscious?" I demanded. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Oh yes, the sedatives are only mild ones. But, you see, Aunt 
  Pansy was doing one of her little experiments at the time, and unfortunately 
  a small amount of her nerve gas seeped into the wind tunnel, causing Agamemnon 
  to suffer a complete memory loss. It is truly remarkable, as if his brain has 
  been simply wiped clean. Pansy assures us that luckily, like the deafness, this 
  total amnesia is only temporary." It was a very pretty speech, but it left me 
  at a complete loss. I gnashed my teeth. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"You sound as if you are gnashing your teeth," said the Scrimgeour. 
  "It must be very frustrating for you. However, I do have some good news. Just 
  now, when I went upstairs to check on Agamemnon's condition, I took the opportunity 
  to rifle through the pockets of his smoking-jacket, and came upon a scrunched-up 
  scrap of paper which looks very much like the beginning of a letter. I'm something 
  of a dab hand at anagrams, and at a guess I'd say the letter is addressed to 
  you, Zoltan. Would you like me to read it to you?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"By all the minnows in the biggest of ponds, yes, yes!" I cried. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Right. As I say, it's only the beginning of a letter. It stops 
  in mid-sentence, actually, but-" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Just get on with it!" I roared. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Keep on like that and I'll have to put mufflers in my ears," 
  said the Scrimgeour. I apologised again. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Now, let me see. <i>Dear Tolzna,</i> it says, <i>I am having 
  a tremendously exciting little holiday, but not a minute passes without my thinking 
  of you and poor Mister Patch. I know that you are still determined to hunt down 
  that album of his, and I have to concede that to do so may be the only way to 
  reanimate him: lord knows we have tried everything else. Aunt Pansy tells me 
  of a terrific private investigator who is by all accounts a match for the late, 
  great Fig: her name is Matilda Spamclot. When you set me the task of finding 
  a Fig-substitute, I overlooked her because-</i> and that's it, I'm afraid. Does 
  it make any sense to you?"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> I thanked him profusely and slammed down the receiver: which 
  was rather foolish of me. I stood there in the sopping heat, feeling all resolute, 
  and consciously setting my jawline into a determined, heroic jut. Then I realised 
  that I didn't have a clue what to do next. How was I to track down Matilda Spamclot? 
  Was she indeed possessed of the same mettle as Fig? Why had the almost insanely 
  thorough Scrimgeour overlooked her? How much would she charge to tackle what 
  appeared to be such a hopeless quest? Even if she succeeded, would my theory 
  prove correct? Would Mister Patch be revivified at the sight of a mouldering 
  album full of fading pre-adhesive postage stampings? My mulling over these questions 
  was interrupted by a hammering at the front door. Without Scrimgeour to do his 
  bit, and assuming that my mother was floating about somewhere in the house fixated 
  on her whims, I hurried down to answer it. Opening the door, I was confronted 
  by a whey-faced young woman in a wheelchair, clutching in her lap a cardboard 
  box barely held together by yards and yards of inexpertly-tied string.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> "Hello there," she said in an exhausted voice, "You must be 
  Zinnigmot Blake." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I am he," I replied, after the briefest of pauses to do a 
  mental anagram-check: I had not heard this one before, but I found it rather 
  pleasing. "And who, might I ask, are you?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">She cleared her throat and spat a gobbet onto the gravel. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"They call me Matilda Spamclot," she announced. </font></p>
