  YARD</font></b> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The cornucopia of delights that is Hooting Yard is offered 
  to readers free of charge. That is as it should be. An unfortunate side effect, 
  though, is that your dutiful editor lives in poverty. Really. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you enjoy these pages, and have some disposable income (or, 
  indeed, are a person of untold wealth), you may wish to show your appreciation 
  by sending some money. Anyone who does so will become an official Friend Of 
  Hooting Yard. Their names will appear on a list (unless anonymity is preferred), 
  they will have my boundless gratitude, and I might even arrange for them to 
  receive a certificate or badge or some other token. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Being an economically invisible member of society, I don't 
  have an active bank account. If you wish to donate a sum, large or small, to 
  keep the howling wolves from the doors of Haemoglobin Towers, simply copy and 
  paste the paragraph below into an email, and I'll get right back to you. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thank you. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Frank </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Your plea has touched my heart-strings and I am now sobbing 
  uncontrollably. I want to send you some money as a token of my appreciation, 
  and by so doing, become a Friend Of Hooting Yard. Please, I beg of you, tell 
  me what to do next! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Passionately yours, </font></p>

<p>NOTE : Those few readers who were subscribers to <i>Crunlop!</i> have shown 
  saintly patience, and probably think - with good reason - that I have forgotten 
  them. I have not. Bear with me.</p>
