<p><b><font size="+2">BUILD YOUR OWN <i>HOUSE OF TURPS</i></font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">A harmless pastime devised by Frank Key</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">YOU WILL NEED:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Sharp scissors, a ruler, a blunt knife for scoring fold lines, 
  and a suitable adhesive.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">INSTRUCTIONS</font></b></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Print out diagrams <a href="hoturps1.jpg">one</a> and <a href="hoturps2.jpg">two</a> 
  on whatever thickness of card is suitable for your printer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Cut out all the pieces along the solid lines. Be careful 
  to include all the tabs on the smaller pieces.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Score along all the dotted lines</font> <font size="+1">using 
  a ruler and a blunt knife. This makes it much easier to fold the pieces properly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. Make the outside of the house first. Fold the card as shown 
  below, with the picture on the outside. Apply glue to the area marked A and 
  stick firmly on the inside.</font></p>
<p><img src="hotdiagone.jpg" width="312" height="195"></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. Then take the roof and fold along the three lines marked. 
  Put glue on the areas marked B and C and stick firmly on top of the house. Make 
  sure it's the right way up!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. Now take the inside piece. Snip carefully along the solid 
  lines into the picture as marked. Don't cut too far! Fold the card as shown 
  below, with the picture on the inside. Apply glue to the blank tabs and stick 
  firmly outside the box.</font></p>
<p><img src="hotdiagtwo.jpg" width="312" height="252"></p>
<p><font size="+1">7. You will notice that there are lots of small free-standing 
  pieces, too many for all of them to fit. Choose a few you like best and stick 
  the tabs to the floor, walls, or ceiling of the house.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">8. Slide the inner box into the outside and your customised 
  House of Turps is complete!</font></p>
