<p><font size="+1">"Cornelius Gemma, <i>lib. 2. de nat. mirac. c. 4.</i> relates 
  of a young maid, called Katherine Gualter, a cooper's daughter, <i>an. 1571.</i> 
  that had such strange passions and convulsions, three men could not sometimes 
  hold her; she purged a live eel, which he saw, a foot and a half long, and touched 
  it himself; but the eel afterwards vanished; she vomited some twenty-four pounds 
  of fulsome stuff of all colours, twice a day for fourteen days; and after that 
  she voided great balls of hair, pieces of wood, pigeon's dung, parchment, goose 
  dung, coals; and after them two pounds of pure blood, and then again coals and 
  stones, on which some had inscriptions bigger than a walnut, some of them pieces 
  of glass, brass, &c. besides paroxysms of laughing, weeping and ecstasies, &c.

<p><font size="+1"><b>IN A CABIN, ON A SHIP </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In a cabin, on a ship, steaming into harbour, were two glum 
  men. No. The ship was steaming away from the harbour, or port, a port whose 
  name ended in -dam. Do not try to guess which port I refer to, for your brain 
  will become dizened by the effort, and if you were an animation, little tweeting 
  birds would circle around your head, such would be your befuddlement. I know 
  whereof I speak, so trust me. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This ship, now, the <i>HMS Important And Grandiose Flying Many 
  Flags</i>, had gravitas, if we can ascribe gravitas to a ship, and as it steamed 
  out of the port of -dam it had many, many flags flying. Some of the flags were 
  blue, a cerulean blue like the best skies on the most gorgeous summer days. 
  If you stare at the bright sky on such a day for long enough, you will see that 
  the air is teeming with spirits, as multitudinous as flakes in a snowstorm, 
  according to a French person called Leo Suavius. And look! Many of the flags 
  flying from the ship, those that are blue and those of other shades, have pictures 
  of angels on them. You may scan the flags as carefully as you wish, but you 
  will not find a skull-and-crossbones hidden among them, for this is not a pirate 
  ship. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Is or was? I fear I have veered from the past tense to the 
  present without explanation. Unless I am careful we shall hurtle into the future, 
  and what is intended to be a sober piece of reportage will become science fiction, 
  and you will toss it aside with a <i>harrumph</i> of displeasure, for if I know 
  you well, dear reader, you would rather have me tell you of that which is prosaic 
  and mundane than be titillated with intergalactic space rockets captained by 
  alien beings called Thargon, zapping x-ray beams at inexplicable foes whose 
  very geometry is unearthly. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once, when I had time to spare, and the ship was still in port, 
  I tried to count all those magnificent flags and found that I could never arrive 
  at an exact number. Perhaps there were sailors aboard hoisting and lowering 
  them so rapidly that I did not see. I did not have a pair of binoculars in those 
  days. Indeed, I still don't, for what use would they be to a Cyclops like me, 
  whose left eye was damaged during the Munich Air Disaster? I shall tell you 
  about that another time. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For now, picture that ship, with its serried blue flags and 
  its innumerable angels, steaming out of -dam, and two glum men in a cabin below 
  decks. The door is closed. The cabin has two portholes, and they are of frosted 
  glass, for no particular reason. One of the gloomy men is sitting on an upper 
  bunk, dangling his spindly legs over the side. When he used to laugh, years 
  ago, he sounded like a bronchial horse, and indeed he suffered terribly from 
  bronchitis and often, on his daily rounds, walked past a field in which a tremendous 
  number of horses were put out to fallow, if that is the correct word. I don't 
  think it is, but I shall let it stand, I am in that kind of mood. But that was 
  long ago. Now, glum and emaciated, he sits on the bunk in a cabin of the ship 
  of many flags and clears his throat. He is about to introduce himself to the 
  other miserable man in the cabin, who has just come in, slamming the door behind 
  him. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This second man is wearing atop his pulsating cranium a dippy 
  hat. For the last few hours he has been thinking, thinking so damn hard, about 
  ducks, for that is the sort of man he is. He wants to complete a catalogue of 
  duck markings, duck behaviour and duck habitats, but has been unable to work 
  on it for a while as he has sprained his wrist and cannot write. This accounts 
  for his glumness, and also for his sling. The sprain occurred when he was trying 
  to unscrew the jammed lid of a jar of hoodie-hoodie paste.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We might ask, at this point, the cause of the other man's gloom, 
  the man on the bunk who used to laugh like a horse long, long ago. Sadly, his 
  interior life is a thing of mystery, to me at any rate. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From bulkhead to poop-hatch, instructions are being shouted 
  back and forth by the ship's crew. The mighty sun is gleaming bronze. Flags 
  are flying and the sky is alive with auks and terns and guillemots. Below decks 
  in the gloomy cabin, the two men reluctantly greet each other. This was the 
  historic moment when Blodgett met Dobson. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>PHANTASMAL QUEST THING</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One of the more lamentable episodes in Dobson's career was 
  the year he wasted trying to write a Tolkeinish fantasy novel. What on earth 
  got into him? It was the year Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba, that Alaska and Hawaii 
  joined the United States, that Archbishop Makarios returned to Cyprus from exile; 
  the year of a royal wedding in Belgium and of the so-called kitchen debate between 
  Nikita Krushchev and Richard Milhous Nixon. It was the year which saw the debut 
  of Rod Serling's <i>Twilight Zone</i>, but also, in February, the day the music 
  died. John McEnroe, Jens Stoltenberg, Max Décharné and Magic Johnson were born 
  during that twelvemonth, while Frank Lloyd Wright, Mario Lanza, and Blind Willie 
  McTell all perished. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And all the while Dobson was holed up in a hut in some Arctic 
  wasteland, writing something to which he gave the working title <i>Phantasmal 
  Quest Thing</i>. It is anybody's guess why he tried to write fantasy fiction. 
  He had no feel for the genre. The reader will find here no elves, hobbits, or 
  wizards - just fleas and flies. Dobson seemed to think he could build a thousand-page 
  epic around a flea called Dave. The other characters - if such they can be called 
  - have equally prosaic names. Instead of, say, Aragorn, Legolas and Gandalf 
  we get Keith, Colin, Sue and Geoff. In place of adventures, we get these barely-anthropomorphised 
  insects - accompanied by a few midges, ticks and bluebottles - flying and leaping 
  around the place engaged in conversations which report on action sequences that 
  are never themselves described. </font></p>
<p><img src="jrrt.jpg" width="109" height="102"></p>
<p><b>Tolkein : witless twaddle</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is a soulless and tedious work, and it is best to draw a 
  veil over Dobson's habit, during that year, of dressing in cardigans and tweeds, 
  hanging around in taverns drinking warm beer, and spouting politically reactionary 
  drivel as a way of ingratiating himself with the fantasists he modelled himself 
  upon. Let us just be thankful that Marigold Chew snapped him out of it. On the 
  twelfth of October 1959 she bundled him on to a boat, locked him in the cabin, 
  and, through a coded system of knuckle-raps on the door, threatened him with 
  a big fierce sword-wielding pneumatic robot dervish. It was a turning point 
  in his career. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Four kinds of wild pigs are found. The most numerous, or at 
  least the most often seen, as it lies about our enclosures, is the common thorn-hog. 
  It is the largest of the wild pigs, long-bodied and flat-sided, in colour much 
  the hue of the mud in which it wallows." - Richard Jefferies, <i>After London</i></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1"><b>ME AND MY THORN-HOG</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was given a common thorn-hog as a Christmas present. It is 
  a wild pig, long-bodied and flat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in 
  which it wallows, that mud being my front garden mud, which is somewhat darker 
  than my back garden mud. The mud along the side of the house is another shade 
  again, but Carnforth - that is the pig's name - seems to prefer the front garden, 
  or at least the mud in the front garden. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I did not name her Carnforth. The benefactor who brought her 
  to me at crack of dawn on Christmas morning told me she had been named before 
  birth, like most thorn-hogs. The common practice, I was informed, is for these 
  wild pigs to be called after iconic railway stations, and Carnforth is, of course, 
  where Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard filmed <i>Brief Encounter</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In addition to telling me my new pig's name, my benefactor 
  gave me a little booklet titled <i>So You've Been Given A Wild Pig?</i>, which 
  is packed with useful information on how to care for it, or I should say, her. 
  Not that Carnforth needs much care. She spends most of her time wallowing in 
  the mud in my front garden, and twice a day I unlock the gate to let her out 
  so she can go rampaging about the hills, grunting furiously and waylaying anything 
  edible. She is, after all, a wild pig. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As she is fond of thorns, I took Carnforth to the garden centre 
  when it opened for its Boxing Day sale, and we had a lovely time looking at 
  the rosebushes. I think I can tell from her prolonged and noisy grunts that 
  she would like to go back there when they have restocked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have not yet allowed my thorn-hog into the house, as I am 
  in the middle of redecorating. Sometimes in the middle of the night I can hear 
  her thumping violently against the door trying to get in, but I want to finish 
  her indoor sty first. Transforming the entire downstairs is going to be quite 
  a job, but it will be such a nice surprise for her. The price of straw is high 
  at the moment, so I may have to wait for the market to settle. Meanwhile, I 
  am keeping an eagle eye on both hay and straw futures, and counting up all the 
  loose change in my jars. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I would write a thank you letter to my benefactor for such 
  a delightful gift, but he did not leave a forwarding address. Indeed, after 
  delivering the wild pig, he scampered away at high speed, shouting "Merry Christmas!" 
  as if in the throes of a hysterical fit. And do you know something? I had never 
  set eyes on him before. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST </b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Will you come with me to Belshazzar's feast?" asked Agnetha. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I didn't know you'd been invited. I'll have to ask Björn," 
  said Benny. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Benny strode off into the mountains to find Björn. Agnetha 
  stayed at the hotel, sipping her alcohol-free absinthe. Wild winds were howling 
  and storm clouds gathered. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Benny found Björn sheltering in a declivity. He was burning 
  charcoal. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Agnetha wants me to go with her to Belshazzar's feast," said 
  Benny, after tipping his hat to Björn in greeting, "What do you think?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"The gods may throw a dice," said Björn, "Their minds as cold 
  as ice." He stared off into the mist-enshrouded distance, towards the fireworks 
  factory and the abandoned tennis courts. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I shall reflect on what you have said and come to a decision, 
  then," said Benny, "Thank you." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on the mountain 
  path by Frida. She was dressed like a gaucho and looked as if she had been weeping. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Frida, whatever is the matter?" asked Benny. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Frida dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel. 
  Her upper lip curled in a sneer. Discomfited by her silence, Benny began to 
  gabble. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Agnetha asked me to accompany her to Belshazzar's feast," 
  he said, "And I asked Björn for his advice. He is up there in a declivity burning 
  charcoal." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," said Frida, and she pranced 
  away into the mist. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>HOW DOBSON SPENT BOXING DAY </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Throughout his life, Dobson ignored Christmas, but he loved 
  to celebrate Boxing Day. Every year, he made a point of marking the occasion 
  differently. Here is his journal entry for one year during the 1950s. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Ah, Boxing Day at last! What a glorious day it is. This year 
  there is snow on the ground, robin redbreasts hopping about, and Dickensian 
  scenes of wassail and carousing over by the old thatched tavern. That being 
  the case, I have nailed fast the shutters and am sitting in the gloom. I wired 
  up a microphone next to the indoor wasps' nest, so hectic buzzing drowns out 
  the intolerable sound of carol-singing and suchlike torments. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I breakfasted upon a platter of boiled leeks and steamed viper-heads. 
  I will spend much of the day in the kitchen, boiling more leeks and steaming 
  more viper-heads for my supper. I had a new telephone installed last week, and 
  I intend to take a break from boiling and steaming to call the police. I am 
  going to read out my new pamphlet to the desk sergeant, or whoever answers the 
  telephone, for it concerns police matters, specifically the legal position regarding 
  the theft of leeks from the greengrocers' and of vipers from the zoo. In the 
  pamphlet, which I wrote in pig Latin, just to show off, I make a full confession 
  to having used thievery to obtain my Boxing Day foodstuffs, and justify doing 
  so with reference to certain historical and/or mythological figures, including 
  Hildegard von Bingen, Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, and the Warrior King Anaxagrotax. 
  I also make mention of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire as a way 
  of throwing the coppers off the scent, should they determine to prosecute me. 
  </font></p>
<p><img src="princes.jpg" width="471" height="322"></p>
<p><b>Some of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire, gesticulating</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">At sixty pages, it may take some time to read the complete 
  text to the police officer, so I will attach an extension cord to the telephone 
  and drag it into the bathroom, and make my call while nestling in a tub of hot 
  milk of magnesia. Over the past year I have bought a couple of those little 
  blue-glass bottles every week, and should have enough to fill the bath. I will 
  heat the milk of magnesia using Professor Tadaaki's Submerged Iron Filament 
  contraption, the label on which claims it can boil a few gallons of any known 
  liquid within thirty seconds. Of course, I do not need to boil my bath, far 
  from it. Tadaaki does not provide a thermometer, but I have one somewhere, in 
  a cupboard, and as soon as I have completed this journal entry I shall go in 
  search of it. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the telephone call, the bath, and my supper, I will put 
  the thermometer back in the cupboard and set a roaring fire in the grate. As 
  I have no coal, nor wood, I will burn the beheaded vipers, for there are many 
  of them and I suspect they will ignite well. I dried them thoroughly by putting 
  them in the airing-cupboard under a pile of blankets. The blankets, incidentally, 
  were not stolen. I wove them myself, when I was a child, and capable of weaving 
  at the loom for hours upon end, humming old Latvian folk tunes to myself. In 
  those long ago days I could never remember the words to the songs, except for 
  one, and that only partially. In papa's translation, it went like this: "There 
  is a shepherd in the hills / There is a [something] green / But black is the 
  crow in the [something] tree / And forked lightning blasts the sky / The shepherd's 
  lass has golden hair / She [something something] milk / But the crow has flown 
  away, my love / And the ducks have left the lake". </font></p>

  humour in his forbidding aspect. The fusty black coat, which sat ill upon his 
  shambling frame, was all besmirched with spilled snuff, and the lees of a thousand 
  quart pots. The bands of his profession were ever awry upon a tattered shirt. 
  His ancient wig scattered dust and powder as he went, while a single buckle 
  of some tawdry metal gave a look of oddity to his clumsy, slipshod feet." -

<p><font size="+1"><b>BATS</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having your blood sucked by a vampire bat can be an alarming 
  experience, and not at all like being bled by leeches. In the latter case, you 
  are likely to be attended by a kindly apothecary or physician, who will apply 
  the leeches and make reassuring noises. Alternatively, you may be trudging through 
  a swamp, and leeches will fasten upon your legs and begin to drain your blood, 
  but in such cases you are unlikely to notice them, as you will be half-submerged 
  in the swamp, therefore in your ignorance of the leeches you will not be frightened. 
  A vampire bat is likely to attack you without warning, however, and so you will 
  be alarmed. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Many folk make the mistake of lumping in pipistrelle, Egyptian 
  fruit, red, long-nosed, little brown, pallid, western mastiff, serotine, pocketed 
  free-tailed, woolly false vampire, hoary, Indiana, northern, ghost-faced, greater 
  horseshoe, Brandt, Honduran white, Natterer's, lappet-browed, noctule, Ipanema, 
  tent-making, big brown, evening, yellow, spotted, Nathusius pipistrelle and 
  other bats with vampire bats, and thus being fearful of them all. But only the 
  vampire bat will plunge its fangs in to the soft white flesh of your neck and 
  begin to drain you of your vital gore. If you are awake, and especially if you 
  are active, for example playing lawn tennis, orienteering, or doing outdoor 
  carpentry, you will be able to fight off the vampire bat. Remember that you 
  are bigger and stronger than it is, and be not afraid. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the other hand, if you are fast asleep, and unprotected 
  by an anti-bat curtain of heavy purple brocade, the vampire bat may suck your 
  blood uninterrupted, until its thirst is sated. If you are the bat's first victim 
  for a while, it may drink all of your blood, and you will not wake up, because 
  you will be lifeless. Do not believe those foolish stories about waking after 
  a visit from a vampire bat and tentatively feeling punctures in your neck and 
  thenceforth being a kind of undead human version with a bloodlust of your own. 
  That will only happen if you live in Transylvania and bear a resemblance to 
  Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney. Note that Lon Chaney is not to be confused with Lyn 
  Cheney, wife of the current US vice-president. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>CHRISTMAS DINNER </b></font></p>
<p><b>Here is a recipe for your Christmas dinner, if you are planning on having 
  one. It is taken from Dobson's pamphlet <i>Some Things To Eat In The Bleak Midwinter. 
  </i></b></p>
<p><img src="holly.gif" width="368" height="54"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Boiled Cormorant A La Dobson </font>(for Malachy O'Neill)</p>
<p><font size="+1">This is a splendid and satisfying dish, easy to prepare, highly 
  nutritious, and the enemy of indigestion. First, ensure your kitchen is free 
  of verminous creeping things with hundreds of legs, suckers and antennae. Root 
  them out and exterminate them. Gather the tiny corpses, place them in a paper 
  bag, seal the bag with glue, carry it out of the house, and set fire to it. 
  Do not go back indoors until every last speck has been consumed by the terrible 
  flames. Now, back in the kitchen, take off your windcheater and your big black 
  boots and wash your hands with carbolic soap. Cover your hairstyle, if you have 
  one, with a clean rag fixed in place by an elastic band. You are ready to begin. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Take a freshly-slaughtered cormorant and place it on your work-surface. 
  Vegetarians can substitute the bird with a pretend cormorant modelled in marzipan. 
  I will not remind you of this point again. Pluck all the feathers off and put 
  them in a grinder. Grind them to fine powder, and, using a funnel, pour the 
  powder into a spare cruet. If there is a ring around the cormorant's neck, as 
  there will be if it has been exploited by fisherfolk, carefully remove the ring 
  and throw it away, unless it is old and decorative, in which case you may wish 
  to pop it in an envelope and send it to <i>Antiques Roadshow</i> veteran Hugh 
  Scully. But do that later, on Boxing Day.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Step two. Boil the cormorant. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While the bird is simmering away, prepare the sauce. Chop up 
  into tiny bits four pomegranates, a plum, lots and lots of potatoes, sixteen 
  bananas, another cormorant, some toffee apples and a choc ice. Place the tiny 
  bits in a bowl and stir thoroughly, then get the funnel again and pour the contents 
  of the bowl into the grinder. Adjust the setting to "moderately violent grinding" 
  and switch it on for no more than ten seconds. Transfer back into the bowl. 
  Add water up to the brim and stir. Do not on any account use tap water. You 
  will ruin the recipe and end up with a bowl of inedible sludge unless you use 
  the fantastically pure spring water drawn from the Mysterious Old Well at Pointy 
  Town. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Drain any remaining water from the pan with the boiled cormorant 
  in it, and tip the contents of the bowl in, making sure you do so in one swift 
  movement. Ideally, it should sound like this - <i>gloop gloop gloop…gloop</i>. 
  Now put the bowl down somewhere, bring the pan back to the boil and allow to 
  simmer while you fry the cocktail sausages. They should be almost, but not quite, 
  black. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You are nearly done. Take a large oval platter and make a bed 
  of shredded lettuce, chives, spring onions, porridge oats, cream crackers and 
  mayonnaise. Have another look around the kitchen to make sure no creepy-crawlies 
  have appeared from any unhatched eggs you may have overlooked earlier. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Turn off the heat, and transfer the boiled cormorant and sauce 
  on to the platter. Use a clean dishcloth to wipe around the edges in case any 
  of the sauce is dribbling over the side. Take a Swiss Army knife out of your 
  pocket, extract the sharpest blade, and, just in case the last time you used 
  it was to dislodge a pebble from the sole of your boot, plunge it into boiling 
  water to sterilise it. Very carefully slice the blade across the cormorant, 
  as deep as you can, and put the knife down. Insert the cocktail sausages into 
  the bird, then sew up the slit with edible butcher's string. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Try to remember where you left the spare cruet, and sprinkle 
  the powdered cormorant feathers evenly over the dish. Add salt and pepper to 
  taste. Serve. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>I SAW THREE SHIPS </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I saw three ships come sailing in, but what did I care about 
  ships? I wasn't hanging around in the dockyards because I wanted to look at 
  ships. I am an entomologist, and I was here to trap boll weevils. I watched 
  them scuttling out of sacks of flour being unloaded from one of the three ships, 
  so I pounced on them with my nylon boll weevil net, and ferried them back to 
  my lab. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I cackled as I assembled my equipment. How they glistened, 
  my pincers and knives and scalpels and clamps and suction tubes and Petri dishes! 
  Pulling on my lab coat, the white starched cotton splattered here and there 
  with the blood of insects, I scampered like an excited puppy over to the Dansette 
  and put on my favourite Ronnie Milsap LP. I like to listen to country music 
  as I dissect boll weevils. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was just sharpening one of my scalpels when the door of the 
  lab burst open. Cursing that I had forgotten to lock it, I span round to find 
  myself confronted by a trio of heavily-armed thugs. They were, to a man, huge, 
  very frightening, and togged out in futuristic Robocop-like uniforms. Their 
  helmets had been burnished to a gleam that I could only envy. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Drop the scalpel, pigdog!" shouted one of them, loud enough 
  to be heard over Ronnie Milsap. I froze, but managed to let the blade fall from 
  my hand. It clattered on the linoleum. I do not approve of carpets or rugs in 
  an insect laboratory. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A second thug snatched up from my work-bench the canvas bag 
  in which I had put the boll weevils. He lifted the visor from his helmet and 
  looked at me with snarling contempt. When he spoke, I was disconcerted by the 
  fluting gentility of his tone. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Never, ever, trap boll weevils as they scuttle out of our 
  flour sacks on the dockside when three ships come sailing in," he said.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Crushed and piteous, I began to mumble something, but he waved 
  a gauntleted hand at me, and interrupted. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"If we ever catch you abducting our boll weevils again, we 
  will do something unimaginably horrible to you," he said, "So be warned." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And with that, the three thugs swept out of the lab, slamming 
  the door behind them. I took a napkin from my pocket and mopped my brow. I was 
  shaking. Ronnie Milsap was singing. It was on the very same day that David Blunkett 
  resigned as the Home Secretary.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>PETROCHEMICAL SHIVER-ME-TIMBERS CONCLAVE </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Rookie pirates aboard container ships need to watch their backs. 
  As a seaside doctor, I cannot count the number of cases I've had of youngsters 
  fresh from their first sea voyage coming to me with cutlass wounds or, worse, 
  lead pellets from a blunderbuss embedded in their crania, dangerously close 
  to the brain. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One such lad was Rufus Farjeon, who ran away to sea when he 
  was just seven. He ran from his parents' gingerbread cottage all the way to 
  the beach, panting, panting, and he swam out to a container ship moored on the 
  horizon and clambered aboard, and in his tiny squeak of a voice he said to the 
  captain "Rufus Farjeon, aged nine, reporting for duty, cap'n!" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Captain Cack was not taken in by the boy's lying about his 
  age, but he placed an avuncular hand on Farjeon's shoulder and quizzed him on 
  his knowledge of obscure marine imponderabilities. The captain's right hand 
  was the avuncular one. His left hand was withered. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Over the next few weeks, young Farjeon scrubbed the decks, 
  sloshed out nautical buckets, polished the railings to a gleam, and learned 
  all there was to know about bells at sea. He also sat at Captain Cack's breakfast 
  table, reading aloud to the old sea dog from Yoko Ono's book <i>Grapefruit</i>, 
  while the captain ate plentiful toast, hard tack biscuits and, by coincidence, 
  halves of grapefruit. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then, one Thursday some weeks into the voyage, the blond and 
  brilliantined bo'sun took the boy aside as he trundled a clattering barrel through 
  a narrow passage between containers. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"A word of warning," muttered the bo'sun, in tones of menace, 
  "At eight bells the captain is holding a petrochemical shiver-me-timbers conclave 
  in his cabin. There may be trouble. Watch your back." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But Rufus Farjeon, who had celebrated his eighth birthday a 
  week ago, was by now puffed up, preening and reckless, and he ignored the bo'sun's 
  words. Reeking of grog and blinded by the pitiless tropical sun, he behaved 
  at the conclave in a foolhardy manner, so angering a bloodthirsty corsair that 
  he was taken to the poop deck and shot in the head. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And thus he turned up in my seaside surgery a few days later. 
  I bandaged his wounds and prescribed a course of Doctor Wainwright's Brain Pills. 
  I well knew that just one pill was enough to stun an ostrich, and I had the 
  lad on twenty of them a day, for his metabolism was inhuman. I needed to find 
  out if he was a changeling. He was. And now he sits like a little potentate 
  on a throne on the jetty, facing out to sea, his bandages discarded and his 
  eyes aglow, and mermaids come to gawp at him, and minnows swim in ribbons at 
  his feet, for he is Triton now, and will always be, throned, festooned with 
  seaweed, and staring out to sea. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>THE CARDBOARD CLUB</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Cardboard Club was an odd little society which met in the 
  vicinity of Bodger's Spinney during the last century. Some say that it still 
  does so, although the evidence for this is slight. Throughout its existence 
  it was difficult to pin it down, to attest with any certainty who its members 
  were and what they did, so those who claim its continuance into the new millennium 
  may indeed be correct. I have just noticed a hornets' nest in my rafters. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We do know that the members of the Cardboard Club were fond 
  of regalia. Several crates and trunks packed with badges, emblems, tassels, 
  embroidery, pennants, flags and suchlike were discovered during excavation works 
  on the Blister Lane Bypass a couple of years ago. Catalogued with care by that 
  prematurely white-haired, mute and pallid man at the museum, the collection 
  provides some clues as to the activities of the Cardboard Club. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For example, it seems reasonably clear that the chief purpose 
  of the club was to collect samples of cardboard. Collect, note, not disperse. 
  What is not yet understood is why this was blanketed in secrecy. After all, 
  cardboard is no longer illegal in my country, nor are there any punitive taxes 
  levied upon the possession of it. The mystery deepens when we consider that 
  no cardboard whatsoever was found with the crates of regalia. One can only assume 
  that the club's cardboard collection was squirrelled away. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The most intriguing item to be found was a toy plasticine model 
  of Beaky, from the sixties beat group Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich. 
  A safety pin attached to his plasticine spinal column suggests that it was worn 
  as a signal of honour, perhaps by the Plenipotentiary Grand Vizier of the Cardboard 
  Club. Alternatively, it may have found its way into the crate by accident, and 
  have nothing to do with the club at all. This line of inquiry is well worth 
  pursuing, but not now, because the frantic buzzing of those hornets is driving 
  me crackers, and I am going to have to climb up on the roof and pick them off, 
  one by one, with my deadly anti-hornet pellet rifle. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Then Old Moneybags savagely rings the bell. Enters the butler, 
  obsequious and solicitous. 'The coffee is bad, the toast is vile, everything 
  is wrong. You are a deleted deleted deleted deleted rascal.' Exit the butler, 
  outwardly humble, inwardly a raging flood of anger, and he meets the maid, who 
  archly invites his attentions. She gets them, only they are in the form of an 
  angry shove and an oath. White with indignation, she stamps her foot and runs 
  into the kitchen, bursting into tears. The cook, solicitous, receives a slap 
  in the face, and as the maid bounces out, the cook, seeking a victim, grabs 
  away the gingerbread from the butcher's boy. And that still hungry juvenile 
  slams the door as he leaves and kicks the slumbering cat off the back doorstep. 
  Unfortunately the film did not show what the outraged cat did." - Abraham Myerson,

<p><font size="+1"><b>THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Today is not only the Hooting Yard website's first birthday, 
  it is also the feast day of St John of the Cross, author of that classic work 
  <a href="http://www.ccel.org/j/john_of_the_cross/dark_night/dark_night_bod0.9.html"> 
  <i>The Dark Night Of The Soul</i></a>. I recommend a thorough reading of the 
  text, if only to remind oneself that this is the original, and is not to be 
  confused with Park No Lip's Korean underworld pulp potboiler <i>The Dark Night 
  Of Seoul</i>, which is in itself a classic, but in a different way. </font></p>
<p><img src="johnofthecross.jpg" width="132" height="192"></p>
<p><b>St John of the Cross</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Alas, in his dotage, Dobson <i>did</i> get the books mixed 
  up, which is why his pamphlet <i>A Full And Frank Commentary On &quot;The Dark 
  Night Of The Soul&quot;, Wherein Certain Controversial Theories Are Proposed 
  Which Have Led The Author Into Fist-Fights With Sailors Outside Tough Drinking 
  Taverns In The Marseilles Dockyards</i> (out-of-print) is such a scrappy piece 
  of work. Reading it, one can only rue the day that Dobson accepted medical advice 
  from a charlatan, and began to take regular infusions of a so-called "patent 
  embrocation for the cranium" which made his last days such a trial. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Aloysius Nestingbird commented "If I ever get my hands on that 
  quack I will strangle him with string and fling his lifeless corpse off the 
  end of one of the jetties to which I have the right of access after a series 
  of lengthy court cases which you don't want to hear about, believe you me". 
  Nestingbird said this to me - spitting vitriol - while we rummaged around in 
  a battered old bureau somewhere deep in the Dobson Archives, trying to find 
  evidence that the pamphleteer had ever actually visited the notorious French 
  port. That he once spent an afternoon in Le Havre, accompanied by a chuckling 
  maniac, we well knew. But Marseilles? Could it be that the title of Dobson's 
  late pamphlet was a piece of fantastic embroidery? If so, his entire career 
  would take on a new complexion, and an unwelcome one. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before Nestingbird and myself were able to complete our search 
  of the bureau, a hot and unexpected lamentable thing happened, and we had to 
  abandon the building. As we blundered our way towards the perimeter fence, a 
  messenger ran towards us bearing news of a new Yoko Ono installation. There 
  was only one thing to do. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bafflingly, the bureau has since disappeared, and with it any 
  chance of completing the magazine article <i>Was Dobson In Marseilles? - A Discursive 
  Analysis</i>, for which Nestingbird and I had been promised a few pounds, or 
  if not that much at least enough for a potato each. But penury, it seems, is 
  destined to dog my footsteps. </font></p>

  do. The government has transport tsars and drugs tsars and smoking tsars and 
  so on, so why should we be left out? The Hooting Yard Tsar is an antipodean

<p><b>The Hooting Yard Tsar has been issuing directives daily, usually by phone. 
  His directives are majestically profound, poetic and logical. I'm not always 
  sure who they are directed towards, but if they were to be followed they would 
  place Western Civilisation on a new, deeper foundation and lead the world towards 
  an end currently inconceivable to any other being now living - some great change 
  in human history as profound as the invention of the city or the written word. 
  Sometimes I find these directives so tearfully inspiring that I wish I could

<p><font size="+1"><b>AT THE DUCKPOND</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Imagine that you are standing beside a duckpond. Perhaps you 
  are holding a plastic bag filled with the torn-up remains of a loaf of bread 
  with which you intend to feed the ducks. You have been known to do such a thing, 
  on a Sunday morning perhaps, come rain or shine. Now, what I want you to consider 
  is as follows. Do you think there are any circumstances, whether on a Sunday 
  morning or at any other time, when you might look at the famished expectant 
  ducks paddling towards you, and single out one particular duck, and say to yourself, 
  "Hmm, that duck looks lugubrious"? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Can a duck take on a lugubrious air? This is no idle question. 
  For whether the answer is Yea or Nay, further and more cogent questions present 
  themselves, tumbling over each other in their urgency to be answered. "If so, 
  how?" or "If not, why not?" are clearly the next in line, but it does not stop 
  there. To arrive at honest answers to all the succeeding questions will take 
  all your wit and insight, and a knowledge not only of ducks and other waterfowl 
  but of biology and psychology and the engines of perception and optics and so 
  on, ad infinitum. You see, as each question begets another, by the time you 
  have finished answering them - not that you will ever really finish answering 
  them, more that you will faint from exhaustion - you will know everything there 
  is to know about everything in the universe. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That being so, the lugubrious duck has earned its crusts of 
  bread a thousandfold. So feed it now, before you swoon.</font></p>

  whereon was none so joyless, so sleepless as he. For his grave stood open near 
  him; it was covered only with the snows of age, not decked with the green of

<p><font size="+1">The first blue day of imbecilic glee was a Tuesday towards 
  the end of March. In truth, the day was not blue, for there was frightful storminess, 
  a blizzard of hailstones, and much tempest and wrack. Nevertheless, when looking 
  back, I remember other things. I remember how we laughed even though our picnic 
  plans were dashed. I remember how we pretended the cow in the field was a Magus, 
  bewitching us. I remember how we ran back to the house and spent the afternoon 
  playing a game of Ayn Rand! Every time you shouted a sentence from <i>The Fountainhead</i> 
  and I countered with one from <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, the uproar was such that 
  Mr Loog Oldham next door took off his big black boot and hammered on the wall. 
  I remember the embers at the end of that first blue day. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second blue day of imbecilic glee was that day we took 
  our bicycles on the train to the fishing village at the end of the world and 
  painted watercolours of the post office and bought stamps and drank Tizer and 
  we were followed around the village by a one-eyed dog with terrible fangs and 
  you wanted to take it home and all afternoon the shrill singing of the orphanage 
  choir filled our ears and I found a tiny toy plastic pig in a thicket of stinging 
  nettles and we cycled all the way home along that dangerous road as huge container 
  lorries thundered past us in both directions. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In spite of that little grumble in today's first item, never 
  let Hooting Yard be accused of being out of touch with popular culture. It's 
  just that we're discriminating in what we pay attention to. Today, for example, 
  we celebrate the double birthday of not just one of the finest male voice icons 
  in twentieth century cinema, but two. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Christopher Plummer is 77 today, and decades have passed since 
  his bizarre, strangulated, bird-like squawkings as Atahualpa in <i>The Royal 
  Hunt Of The Sun</i>. I have spent hours upon hours trawling the internet to 
  find out if a Plummermaniac has posted sound samples from the film, but to no 
  avail. Happy birthday, Atahualpa. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Born on the same day two years before Plummer was Dick Van 
  Dyke, the man who invented cockney, or possibly mockney, or whatever that accent 
  was that he used to such powerful effect in <i>Mary Poppins</i>. Chim chim cheroo 
  indeed. One little-known fact about Dick, possibly because it is entirely spurious, 
  is that he signed a multibillion dollar deal to allow his initials to be used 
  by the manufacturers of DVD technology. At one point, the now-ubiquitous discs 
  were going to be called EVDs, because <i>Chariots Of The Gods?</i> author and 
  wag Erich Von Daniken was asking for less money for his initials. The full story

<p><font size="+1">Nobody who the Grunty Man snatches away ever, ever comes back, 
  so nobody can say what he looks like, children. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Where does he take them, ma? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He snatches them from their beds and tucks them under his arms 
  and he bounds away with them up into the dark terrible hills and then he makes 
  them work in his big furnace in a grim black cave where he makes his grunty 
  noise at them all day and all night and it is so loud and horrible that birds 
  fall out of the sky if they hear it… Are you fast asleep now, little ones? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Not yet, ma. Tell us more about the Grunty Man. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Grunty Man is ten thousand years old, and even huge bears

  are frightened of him. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Does he snatch away bad animals too, ma? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yes he does, and he keeps them in cages and sets them on the 
  bad children when they don't work hard enough in his terrible belching furnace 
  in the cave. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oooooooh. What is there to eat in the cave? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">No icing at all? Are they like fairy cakes? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They are, children, but poisonous fairy cakes. And they taste 
  horrible! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Eeeeuuurrgghh. We would be sick. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You would be very sick. But you would never die, because the 
  Grunty Man would keep you working at the furnace. Clang clang clang. Imagine

  you are bad children and do not fall asleep right now, tucked up under your

<p><font size="+1">I wrote some months ago that where I live - when I am not on

  hub. I am not entirely sure who has so designated it, although doubtless it 
  was some "New" Labour apparatchik. In fact it would be more correct to dub it 
  a forthcoming hub, or a hub-to-be, for of course its hubdom is not yet complete. 
  I do not know how many tranches are involved in the area's transformation from 
  whatever it is now to being a true hub, and this bothers me. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I want to know about the tranches, pretty desperately. Something 
  cannot become a hub in Blair's brave new land without each successive tranche 
  being signed off, or so I gather. </font></p>

  out-of-print pamphlets. One of the researchers is tall and Hungarian. The other 
  is lantern-jawed and recently suffered from gastroenteritis. They have only 
  been working together for a short time, and have never met face-to-face, communicating 
  via a virtually redundant communications system involving pneumatics, magnets 
  and steam. </font></p>
<p><img src="dobsonbook.jpg" width="98" height="88"></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have to say that this picture looks more like a book than 
  a pamphlet, in which case it may be the unimaginably rare <i>Stairway To Heaven</i>, 
  one of Dobson's most puzzling works. The picture is too small to decipher the 
  text, so we can only suppose.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> <i>Stairway To Heaven </i>was written in the first flush of 
  Dobson's youth, the manuscript scribbled in a clutch of exercise books the pamphleteer-to-be 
  stole from an enormous locomotive stuck in a railway siding. The guards had 
  apparently gone off to paddle in a pond and hunt wild boar while they waited 
  for spare parts. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The book is subtitled <i>Some Conjectures On The Possible Location 
  Of An Actual Staircase That Leads To The Celestial Sphere</i>, and is a remarkably 
  assured text for one so young. It begins thus: </font></p>
<p><b>As I wander through the wilderness of this world, I often fall to wondering 
  how I will get to heaven. I know it is there somewhere, for that is what my 
  mama and papa have told me ever since I was a tot. I know, too, that every single 
  thing they have ever told me is true, because they vowed it was so. They made 
  these vows to me on my sixth birthday, as papa cut my cake and shortly after 
  mama clambered in through the window after chasing away a robber with her high 
  velocity sniper's rifle. She came through the window of the kitchen because 
  at that time the door to the cottage was sealed shut against fiends and demons, 
  known to prey upon good folk in the countryside where I grew. Papa used quick-drying 
  cement for the job, completing the work in just an hour on the one day that 
  winter when there was no rain or snow, for we lived in a valley. If there is 
  ever a second edition of this book I will check a meteorological reference work 
  to check the accuracy of that statement.. </b></p>
<p><font size="+1">There never was a second edition, of course, a fact that sometimes

<p><font size="+1"><b>ONE MORNING ON THE LANE THAT RUNS FROM POINTY TOWN TO COCTLOSH</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was a sweltering day. I was strolling along the lane that 
  runs from Pointy Town to Coctlosh when I chanced upon a Jesuit priest sitting 
  on a bench. I tipped my hat and greeted him. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello," I said, "What a sweltering day it is." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Felix Randal the farrier o is he dead then?" said the priest, 
  and I realised that I was talking to Gerard Manley Hopkins. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Father Hopkins!" I cried, perhaps a tad overenthusiastically, 
  for he frowned at me and said: "My duty all ended, who have watched his mould 
  of man, big-boned and hardy-handsome, pining - " </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Would you like a bite of my medlar?" I interrupted, and as 
  I did so a dapple-dawn-drawn falcon flew past, narrowly missing my head. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Pining," continued Hopkins, without taking a blind bit of 
  notice of my fruit-sharing initiative, "till time when reason rambled in it 
  and some fatal four disorders, fleshed there, all contended?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Swallowing a chunk of medlar, I wondered about these four disorders. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Impetigo, ague, the bloody flux and Blotzmann's syndrome?" 
  I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Father Hopkins was now fretting with his rosary beads. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Sickness broke him," he said. I was beginning to wonder why 
  the priest was chuntering on about a dead farrier, but I decided to sit down 
  on the bench. He didn't flinch. He kept talking, but I was no longer listening. 
  I had become transfixed by the sight of a flock of weird unholy birds circling 
  above us. They were black and purple and huge, with savage talons and a wingspan 
  of monstrous proportions. Could they be the legendary Birds of Bog I had read 
  about in my little primer when I was an infant at Sunday School? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Suddenly Father Hopkins tapped me on the shoulder. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"How far from then forethought of," he was shouting, "all thy 
  more boisterous years, when thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst peers, 
  didst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal!" 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The last few words were yelled so loudly that my hat nearly 
  fell off my head. But it seemed as if the priest had finished jabbering at last. 
  I felt a sudden urge to kiss his hand, as if he were a bishop, but I decided 
  not to. Instead, I thrust my last medlar at him.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> "Take it, take it, Father Hopkins," I said, and I got up and 
  walked away. All in all, it was quite an interesting morning. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>MELDRUM FONSECA : ÜBER-TROMBONIST </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Eschewing the nose-flute, Meldrum Fonseca first took up the 
  trombone at the age of seventy. Before this, his entire musical experience was 
  limited to singing in the bath - or possibly singing in Bath, it is not quite 
  clear. Having spent the best part of his life as a plinth magnate, Meldrum was 
  a rich man. From Aleppo to Zug, few cities or towns exist without at least one 
  plinth from the Fonseca Plinth Factory or one of its many franchised workshops 
  dotted haphazardly around the globe. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The conversation on that autumn day, under an overcast sky, 
  went something like this. Meldrum's paramour, Mrs Fonseca, asked him why he 
  had never learned to play the trombone. This was a common verbal sally of hers, 
  keeping Meldrum alert by firing questions at him which he had never been asked 
  before. On the same day, for example, she asked him if he knew the slightest 
  thing about the skeletal structure of badgers, and whether he could recommend 
  a particular recording of a 19th century railway timetable being read aloud 
  from cover to cover. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Due to Mrs Fonseca's constant mental prodding, Meldrum's brain 
  was a superb mechanism, thoroughly exercised, almost like a champion greyhound. 
  Although often his answers to these constant questions might simply be "yes" 
  or "no", his response to the trombone enquiry was "Well stap my chives, Marjorie-Suzanna,

<p> <font size="+1">"It appears that in the nineteenth century only one airship 
  was constructed in this country, which proved to be capable of ascending into 
  the air and being propelled by its own machinery. This airship made its appearance 
  in the year 1848, and was built to the designs of a man named Partridge. Very 
  little information is available concerning this ship. The envelope was cylindrical 
  in shape, tapering at each end, and was composed of a light rigid framework 
  covered with fabric. The envelope itself was covered with a light wire net, 
  from which the car was suspended. The envelope contained a single ballonet for 
  regulating the pressure of the gas." - George Whale, <i>British Airships, Past

<p><font size="+1"><b>CONSTANCE, BEREFT </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The pigs needed feeding, so Constance took a big crate full 
  of apples and trudged out in the morning drizzle. The apples were pippins, and 
  mostly rotten, but she knew that the pigs would guzzle them down. Over by the 
  aircraft hangar a flop-eared bunny rabbit was hopping about among a pile of 
  abandoned pots and pans. Constance worried about rust, but not today. She tipped 
  the apples into the pigsty, put the empty crate onto a pile of other empty crates, 
  and headed off towards the orchard as dawn was breaking. Constance had an assignation 
  in the orchard. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The following day, before her assignation, Constance not only 
  fed the pigs with a crate full of overripe plums, but she gathered up all the 
  pots and pans strewn around the door of the aircraft hangar and derusted them 
  with a derusting solution of her own devising. The flop-eared bunny rabbit was 
  nowhere to be seen, but she saw an Arctic hare on the horizon. Then she trotted 
  off excitedly to the orchard. </font></p>
<p><img src="hare.jpg" width="180" height="183"></p>
<p><b>This is what an Arctic hare looks like</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the Thursday, she was late getting to the orchard for her 
  assignation, because one of the pigs had contracted a lethal pig disease, and 
  she ran across the muddy fields to call the local veterinary surgeon, a mutton-chopped 
  old fool with watery eyes. He was still abed, and Constance knocked and knocked 
  on his door to rouse him. When he eventually came down in his dressing gown, 
  not quite awake, and unlatched his door, the following dialogue took place: 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Constance : Vet, vet, I have a sick pig! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Veterinary Surgeon : Let me get dressed and put all the necessaries 
  in my bag and I will come with you. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Constance : Hurry, hurry, vet! The pig may die! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Veterinary Surgeon : I will do my utmost to save your pig. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Because Constance had run across the fields to call the veterinary 
  surgeon, she was late for her assignation in the orchard. When she got there, 
  at last, she found a note fastened to a withered old pugton tree. She read only 
  half of it before hot tears welled up and she fled from the orchard sobbing 
  and bereft. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Back at the pigsty, the watery-eyed veterinary surgeon was 
  packing up his bag. Constance blundered through the gate, fraught and weeping 
  and wild-eyed. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Veterinary Surgeon : I have cured the pig, Miss Constance. 
  All will be well. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>HENGIST POD ASKS A QUESTION</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now here is a question worth asking. Did there once exist, 
  aeons ago, on a distant, icy planet, a race of beings not unlike emperor penguins 
  in appearance, if not size, for let us say that these beings were minuscule, 
  that a hundred of them gathered together would be no bigger than a gnat, and 
  that these beings were unfathomably stupid, that their behaviour patterns were 
  inane and pointless, but that they somehow managed to construct an intergalactic 
  spacecraft built from pack ice, and used it to ferry themselves to other planets 
  and other galaxies for no purpose other than what we might call sight-seeing, 
  and that over millions of years they visited thousands of planets without ever 
  once alighting on earth, for the pale blue dot of our planet, to use Carl Sagan's 
  phrase, was visually horrifying to these beings, whose eight eyes could not 
  tolerate the colour blue, in any of its tints and shades, or green, for that 
  matter, given that their own planet bathed in a totally alien colour spectrum 
  unimaginable to the human brain, unimaginable even to someone like self-styled 
  brain guru and MindMap™ maker Tony Buzan, and that one of these beings, wearing 
  a sort of rocket booster backpack, jetted out of the spacecraft when it was 
  near earth, and this tiny emperor penguin-like being collided with an asteroid 
  and was pulled into earth's magnetic field, if that is possible, and it came 
  in to land on the towpath of the canal just outside my door, last Wednesday, 
  when I was on my way to buy a rake and a hoe for my allotment, having counted 
  my potatoes as I liked to do every morning, wearing a plastic Viking helmet 
  with only one horn, the other horn having broken off when I was clambering down 
  the hillside without pausing for breath on that day I was pursued by an ill-tempered 
  giant badger whose sett I had accidentally demolished? Answer me that, and I 
  will give you sixpence. </font></p>

  the outskirts of Minsk. Why was a Minsk-man here in the park? A man who was 
  jabbering at a crow in a tree? Doddery Martin mussed his hair. He went to feed 
  the park's polar bear. He fed it with biscuits and nuts. I said, he fed it with

  it sometimes happens that a child, or a rustic, finds a wedge-shaped piece of 
  metal or a few triangular flints in a field or near a road. There was no such 
  piece of metal, there were no such flints, lying there yesterday, and the finder 
  is puzzled about the origin of the objects on which he has lighted. He carries

<p><font size="+1"><b>HINGED, UNHINGED, OR NEITHER? </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The quandary that beset Dennis, apart from his conviction that 
  in a previous life he was Veronica Lake, was whether he was hinged or unhinged, 
  or possibly neither. Most of us would not fret about such a thing, but Dennis 
  did. There is a temptation to say that this fact in itself proves that Dennis 
  was indeed unhinged, and to ponder why this had not occurred to him. But it 
  had, and it added to his fretfulness. For there was so much about Dennis that 
  was hinged. For example, when he chanced upon poisonous toads, he scampered 
  out of their way, rather than picking them up and taking them home, as an unhinged 
  person might.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Dennis was adept at self-preservation in a very hinged way. 
  When he plunged out of an aircraft at high altitude, without a parachute, he 
  made sure that he lit upon an air current that allowed him to drift easily onto 
  a bank of fresh-fallen snow, thus cushioning his landing and meaning that he 
  only spent six weeks in hospital instead of being coffined up and buried in 
  that Baltimore churchyard where lie the remains of Edgar Allan Poe. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dennis had given much thought to the idea that he might be 
  neither hinged nor unhinged, not in the sense that he fell somewhere in between, 
  but that hingedness or its opposite was foreign to him, as an igloo to a Maori, 
  or a biro to a caveman. Dennis remembered, in addition to being Veronica Lake, 
  being a caveman. The gulf of thousands of years between these lives was a blank, 
  however, and Dennis wondered if he had spent all that time in some kind of limbo. 
  If he had, where was that limbo, and had he been hinged or unhinged, or neither, 
  while trapped in it? This seemed to Dennis so monumental a question that he 
  could find no rest. </font></p>

  All of them. If Dennis' story has tugged at your heart-strings, please, please

<p><font size="+1">Have you ever met someone from Switzerland named Robinson? 
  Someone named Robinson, from Switzerland, who has been shipwrecked? I have. 
  I was sitting in a coffee bar in Old Grimy Town up north, and as I sipped my 
  cocoa and leafed through yesterday's copy of <i>The Old Grimy Town Gazette</i>, 
  in walked Fathead Robinson and Poopy Robinson and their children Ned, Gristle 
  and Sawdust. They sat at my table. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"We are the Swiss Family Robinson," said Fathead. "We are from 
  Switzerland, and we were shipwrecked."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I looked at them one by one, trying to see evidence of their 
  ordeal. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"When was this?" I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Years ago," said Poopy, "We were rescued by a big boat of 
  birds." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"A boat of birds?" I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Yes," said Ned, "It was a big boat and there were no humans 
  aboard it, only birds. Starlings and chaffinches and buntings and wagtails and 
  corncrakes and linnets and sparrows and swans." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Was a swan the captain?" I asked. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Yes," said Ned, "How did you guess?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I fixed him with my one working eye, sipped the dregs of my 
  cocoa, and stood up. Saying nothing, I swept out of the coffee bar, and went 
  straight home to write in my diary. <i>Today I met the Swiss Family Robinson</i>, 
  I wrote, and then I put down my pencil and became lachrymose, thinking about 
  swans imperilled on the high seas, and my parrot, Lascelles, who yearned for

<p><font size="+1"><b>TINY ENID CONFRONTS THE RUSSIAN BEAR</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tiny Enid put down her book and sighed. She was reading, I 
  think, one of the later novels of Daphne Du Maurier, and it was beginning to 
  irritate her. She decided to go and check on the gloxinia in her garden. Stepping 
  out through the french windows, she saw that the great Russian bear was prowling 
  around at the bottom of her garden. When it saw Tiny Enid, it let out a fierce 
  bellow.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Tiny Enid sat down in her ugly but highly-polished stainless 
  steel garden chair, the one she had rescued from a burning building all those 
  years ago. She lit a cheroot, inhaled deeply, and fixed the Russian bear with 
  a supercilious, sneering look. She wondered if this was the same Russian bear 
  that had mauled to death Vitaly Nikolayenko, one of Russia's best-known bear 
  researchers and a man who spent twenty-five years living with the enormous brown 
  bears of the wild Kamchatka peninsula. He had been found dead in an apparent 
  bear mauling. The body of Nikolayenko, sixty-six, whose lonely journeys allowed 
  him to compile one of the most exhaustive documentaries on the giant, nine-foot 
  cousins of the North American grizzly, was found at a lake near his remote one-room 
  hut on the Tikhaya River. The six-and-a-half-inch pawprint of a medium-sized 
  male bear was found next to his body, along with an empty can of pepper spray 
  with which Nikolayenko had apparently tried to defend himself. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Just two months before, American bear researcher Timothy Treadwell 
  and his girlfriend were killed by a bear in Alaska's Katmai National Park. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The diminutive Nikolayenko, a self-educated researcher and 
  photographer, walked more than six hundred and twenty miles a year through the 
  remote river valleys and coastal plains of Kamchatka, whose giant brown bears 
  were under increasing threat from foreign hunters and poachers. A senior ranger 
  on the Kronotsky Wildlife Reserve, Nikolayenko battled illegal hunting and fishing 
  in the reserve. His patrols kept him in the wilderness for months on end. He 
  spent each day from dawn to dusk following bears, documenting their feeding, 
  mating, and social habits. By night, he would return to his hut, light a kerosene 
  lamp and fill what became hundreds of journals, a body of work that eventually 
  became one of the most important biographical records of brown bear behaviour 
  in existence. He documented an average of eight hundred bear contacts each year, 
  according to <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Kim Murphy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Did you maul Vitaly Nikolayenko to death?" asked Tiny Enid. 
  The Russian bear was now lumbering across the lawn towards her, but when it 
  heard her high-pitched voice, redolent of a terrified crow, it stopped and thwacked 
  its mighty paws against its own head. It is not easy for a Russian bear to look 
  shamefaced and coy, but the one in Tiny Enid's garden did so. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Now get along with you," she said, stubbing out her cheroot 
  under her jet black Manolo Blahnik pump, "Go and do something useful like grubbing 
  for worms in the muck by yonder pond." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Russian bear turned and fled. Tiny Enid got up and crossed 
  the lawn to shut the garden gate. Then she went to the airport to catch her 
  flight to Madagascar, or possibly to Plovdiv, I am not quite sure where she 
  went that day.</font></p>
