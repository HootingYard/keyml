<p><font size="+1"><b><font size="+2">Mister Scrimgeour's Aviary</font> </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Last Tuesday, Mr Scrimgeour realised his lifelong ambition. 
  Five hundred yards to the south of the Pang Hill Orphanage, he threw open the 
  gates of his aviary. The tots had been gathered outside for three hours, the 
  tinier ones literally wetting themselves with excitement. The big fat sun battered 
  down: it was a cloudless day. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mr Scrimgeour had announced the opening of his aviary only 
  the day before, but work had been going on for months, if not years. The parentless 
  infants had grown used to the sight, from the orphanage windows, of a gigantic 
  fence of corrugated iron. Suddenly, overnight, it was gone, the outer walls 
  of the aviary visible at last. As they ate their breakfast porridge, they were 
  told that they would be the very first visitors. Mr Scrimgeour did not even 
  want to be paid. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And now, at noon, they marched solemnly in, their excitement 
  replaced by awe. At first, there were no birds to be seen. Beyond the main gate, 
  at the end of a muddy pathway, were two further gates: huge, of beaten bronze, 
  and each with a sign upon it, a single word, black on white, in letters so plain 
  and clear that even the most myopic infant could read them, if they could read 
  at all, and many of them could not, because the Pang Hill Orphanage was a notoriously 
  ill-run institution, the principal an unscrupulous ex-mariner who picked his 
  staff from wretched sinks of iniquity down by the docks. Between the gates stood 
  Mr Scrimgeour, wearing a peculiarly dainty hat. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hello, hello, oh hello children!" he cried, his jollity somewhat 
  forced. "You must come and see my birds! But you must choose. You may only enter 
  through one gate. On one side, you will find cages containing specimens of all 
  the birds that the Bible says are clean. And on the other, the birds that the 
  Bible says are unclean. The choice is yours!"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The poor little Godless tinies looked at each other, and at 
  Mr Scrimgeour, and at the gates. Whatever may lie behind them, the gates themselves 
  were identical - neither glistening and shiny nor stained and splattered with 
  muck. They did not know that behind one gate they would find turtle doves, pigeons, 
  quails, sparrows, swallows, cocks and hens, partridges and cranes, and that 
  behind the other were eagles, ossifrage, ospreys, vultures, gledes, kites, ravens, 
  owls, great owls, little owls, hawks, nighthawks, cuckoos, cormorants, swans, 
  pelicans, gier eagles, storks, herons, lapwings, bats, ostriches, peacocks and 
  bitterns. The poor little mites had no idea at all, and they could certainly 
  not ask for guidance from the ruffians in whose charge they languished. No doubt, 
  dear reader, you have read your Bible and can run to the orphans' aid, and while 
  you are about it, release the bats! </font></p>
