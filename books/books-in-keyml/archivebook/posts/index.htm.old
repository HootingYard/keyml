<p><font size="+1"><b>PLOVDIV LENSES</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Mesmerised a duck with a chalk line drawn from her beak sometimes 
  level and sometimes forwards on a black table." So wrote Gerard Manley Hopkins 
  in his journal on 27 April 1871. I have long treasured this glimpse of the repressed 
  Jesuit taking time out from various mortifications of the flesh to dally with 
  a duck. Buried within his prose writings as it is, and thus by no means as well 
  known as those magnificent poems, 'Father Hopkins and his duck' took on the 
  air of a private pleasure for me, similar to that (illusory) sense of 'ownership' 
  we feel for a favourite book, or piece of music, that hardly anyone else seems 
  aware of. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So a few years ago, when I was reading an essay by Nicholson 
  Baker - and I can't quite recall the piece, but it was probably in his collection 
  <i>The Size Of Thoughts</i> - I reacted curiously when I came upon a line where 
  he says, in passing, "Hopkins mentions somewhere mesmerising a duck", or words 
  to that effect. Part of me was pleased, wanting to give Mr Baker a conspiratorial 
  wink, two chums sharing a snippet of private enjoyment. But I was vaguely irritated, 
  too. How dare he go into print with Hopkins' duck before I publish my (never 
  actually to be written) monograph? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Something similar has now happened with me and Thomas Pynchon. 
  Eagerly gobbling up the highly enjoyable <i>Against The Day</i>, what is this 
  I find on page 936? "Cyprian had been closely scanning the map with a Coddington 
  lens." Had he indeed? That would be the same Coddington lens which turns up 
  from time to time in Hooting Yard, would it? Type "Coddington" into the Dobson 
  search engine at the top of the page and you will find no less than four mentions 
  of Coddington lenses within the archive. Now it would not surprise me if many 
  readers think I just made it up, and it is true that there is a fifth mention 
  (of a Coddington brush) which is spurious. But there are times when I know what 
  I'm talking about. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Coddington lens was invented by Henry Coddington in 1829. 
  It is a single lens with two curved sides and a groove cut around the middle 
  of the lens - the groove acting as a lens stop. It was (still is) a simple microscope 
  handy for naturalists working in the field. I don't think there is a huge number 
  of references to Coddington lenses in contemporary fiction, and I am quite happy 
  to welcome Mr Pynchon to what I think of as my club. Intriguingly, twelve pages 
  further on in <i>Against The Day</i>, on page 948 we find "Someplace between 
  Plovdiv and Petrich, they disappeared." Ah, Plovdiv! Devotees of my stories 
  of Ugo, his blind ma, and his pal Ulf - about whom we have not heard for too 
  many moons - will smile at the mention of that fair and fabled town, or city, 
  whichever it might be. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan, but that was 
  outside, in the vast harrowing wilderness of wind and ice and storm and horror, 
  whereas we were snug inside in the lecture tent, cupping in our hands piping 
  hot mugs of a strange Norwegian soup, peering through the steam towards the 
  platform upon which stood a lectern, awaiting a lecturer. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There was, as you can imagine, typical lecture-tent hubbub. 
  But then, suddenly, he was there, at the lectern, smashing his fist on it, startling 
  us all, so the hubbub was hushed in an instant, and he began to speak. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Valves! Flaps! Funnels! Ducts! Dials! Plungers! And hundreds 
  upon hundreds of nozzles! My name is Serge." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He then gathered up a sheaf of papers from the lectern and 
  left the platform, disappearing behind a curtain of mauve and cerise brocade, 
  and we were forced to conclude that the evening's lecture was at an end. Now 
  this was something of a quandary. It was early evening, out in the trackless 
  icy wastes, and we were at a loose end. It may have been worth pursuing Serge, 
  of course, if only to pump him for the precise meaning of what had seemed to 
  be very well-chosen words. Which valves did he mean, what flaps, and so on and 
  so forth. Elhugavamp, my companion, was pessimistic, however. She said she knew 
  his type, and he would be forever unforthcoming. I pondered what "type" Serge 
  was, and how Elhugavamp knew enough of them to make so sweeping a judgement. 
  Before I could quiz her to this effect, there was an unutterably hideous inhuman 
  eerie blood-curdling eldritch awful howling from outside. Elhugavamp stopped 
  up her ears with cotton wool and continued to smoke her acrid Serbian cigarillo, 
  looking quite plussed and nonchalant, unlike me, for I was nonplussed and chalant, 
  and innocent of cotton wool ear-stoppers. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A waiting page person stepped to my side to take my drained 
  soup mug, and I asked him what was the cause of the howling. He said nothing 
  in reply, merely exchanging sidelong glances with Elhugavamp, who I am sure 
  nodded in response to his imperceptibly raised eyebrow. The next thing I knew, 
  he had taken me forcibly by the arm, steered me out of the tent, plopped me 
  none to gently on to a sledge, boarded it himself, and mushed a team of huskies 
  who sped us across the ice at bewildering speed. The howling had not been husky 
  howling, of that I was convinced, for I have made a thorough study of the howlings 
  of all known hounds, and of certain other howling creatures which are not hounds, 
  such as monkeys. But the fact that my question remained unanswered was of little 
  concern to me now, as I hung on to the wooden safety rails of the sledge, fearful 
  that if I lost my grip I would topple off onto the ice, or snow, or whatever 
  impossibly white substance it was we were streaking across, glistening under 
  the moonlight. David Bowie would, once, have dubbed it "serious moonlight", 
  and not without reason. I do not think I have ever been in a more serious frame 
  of mind than I was then. A thousand questions jumbled in my brain. </font><font size="+1">The 
  only one I can recall, all these </font><font size="+1">years later, was "Did 
  they put something in the soup?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was a good question, actually. Later, when I was sitting 
  opposite Serge in a sort of giant bamboo-and-straw pod that might have been 
  constructed from half a dozen balloon baskets, I asked him about the soup. His 
  reply was fascinating. Lengthy, but absolutely fascinating. Among the points 
  I managed to jot down with my jotting stub in my jotter were the following: 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. As I had surmised, the soup was strange and Norwegian. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. The recipe had been discovered in a manuscript entitled 
  <i>Some</i> <i>Strange Norwegian Soup Recipes Copied By Hand From Ancient Incunabula</i> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Elhugavamp had sprinkled something in to the soup as it 
  simmered on the stoves at the back of the tent. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. He, Serge, was but a spectral being who had been sent to 
  impart an important message to the world, and I was to be the recipient of that 
  message. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. Well, having said that, either me or somebody else whose 
  identity he could not divulge. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once he had ceased his babbling, I shifted uneasily on my chaise 
  longue and fixed him with what I hoped was a steely glare. This was completely 
  wasted, for I later learned that Serge was as blind as a Blunkett. He eschewed 
  the use of a guide dog because, being spectral, he had no need for earthbound 
  assistance. Having not knowingly met an ethereal being before, I felt rather 
  shy, and flapped my hands around awkwardly. One of my shoelaces had come undone 
  on the high-speed skim across the wasteland to Serge's pod. I became conscious 
  that there were bits of steamed greens from the soup in my beard. Serge was 
  saying nothing more for the time being. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We sat in silence for some time. I could not help pondering 
  on Elhugavamp's perfidy, if perfidy it was. I had not known her for long, but 
  would not have thought her capable of stooping so low as to poison a strange 
  Norwegian soup. And not just my mug, but the cauldron full! I wondered about 
  the others in the lecture-tent audience, some of whom I counted as friends. 
  Little Tim the meteorology student, Sacha the ruffian, Constance Crewfudd the 
  transcriber of witterings by Yoko Ono… were they, and others, now beyond help, 
  their digestive systems shutting down as Elhugavamp's mysterious soup-sprinkling 
  ravaged their innards? I was seized with a desperate need to return to the tent, 
  however perilous the journey may be, and stood up suddenly, gesticulating like 
  a maniac at Serge, who, blind though he was, regarded me with amusement. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was at this point that a pair of ostriches came thudding 
  and scampering into the pod. At least, I think they were ostriches. You can 
  never be sure, particularly if, like me, you have not accorded bird life the 
  same painstaking attention as you have hounds, and I grant that I have not done 
  so, no, never, never, never, and I regret that now. </font><font size="+1">Serge 
  greeted the ostriches - if that is what they were - with a curiously unnerving 
  whoop. Unnerving because it sounded exactly, and I mean <i>exactly</i>, like 
  Elhugavamp's laughter, a sound I knew well and would never hear again without 
  shuddering. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">How convenient if I could say that I swooned and recalled nothing 
  more. But I remember those next two minutes with a grim clarity. There is a 
  line in one of Dennis Beerpint's poems that goes "Then the ostriches revealed 
  themselves as emissaries from [something something] / And all was magnesium 
  white and [something]". That pretty much sums up how it was. I often wonder 
  how Beerpint, that puny versifier, somehow managed to foretell what happened 
  to me that night, in an otherwise irrelevant piece of concrete drivel. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One of the ostriches gave me the once over and told Serge he 
  had picked the wrong person - see point 5 above. Their pod would have to be 
  released from its restraining wires and be transported, I knew not how, to the 
  perimeter of a holiday camp near Basingstoke, where the true - and, it was hinted, 
  more worthy - recipient of Serge's otherworldly message was awaiting them. I 
  had time to tie my shoelace before I was bundled out of the pod and abandoned. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I hailed a passing motorised snow plough which took me back 
  to the lecture-tent. Everyone was still there, looking none the worse for wear, 
  animatedly discussing valves and flaps and funnels and dials and ducts and plungers 
  and hundreds upon hundreds of nozzles. The consensus was that Serge had been 
  the most charismatic lecturer of the winter. Through a fug of pipe smoke I sought 
  out Elhugavamp, and found her lounging in a nook, her eyes flashing brilliantly, 
  and laughing her head off, and I shuddered. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"One day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the 
  world, all the beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locusts, grasshoppers, 
  and other creatures who fly or hop or crawl, and shut them up in a huge sack 
  well tied at the end. What a queer, squirming, muffled-buzzing bundle it made, 
  to be sure! Then the Lord called the woman to him and said, 'Woman, I would 
  have you take this sack and throw it into the sea'." - Abbie Farwell Brown, 
  <i>The Curious Book Of Birds</i></font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>PAUPERS' DROOL </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was once believed that children frightened by thunderstorms 
  could be emboldened by the application of a tincture of paupers' drool to their 
  infant foreheads. When I say "it was once believed", I mean to be very specific. 
  This was once believed, by one person, for a very brief period of time. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The person was Prince Fulgencio, the so-called 'prancing prince', 
  who one autumn day found his daughter, the Infanta Gertrude, cowering behind 
  an arras in her playroom. One rarely finds an arras these days anywhere except 
  upon the dramatic stage, but the prancing prince had thespian inclinations and 
  his palace was littered with theatrical props. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Whyfore art thou cowering so behind the arras as thunderclaps 
  rend the sky?" asked the prince. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In reply, the Infanta Gertrude whimpered in terror as a fresh 
  thunderclap rent the sky. Her playroom was on the topmost floor of the palace, 
  and its ceiling had been removed, exposing the room to the mighty firmament 
  overhead. The prince wanted to toughen up his daughter in preparation for a 
  life of ruthless tyranny, and it dismayed him to see her milksop ways. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus it was that he strode off into the Weird Woods of Woobyhoobyhoo 
  to consult with the Wise Woman. He found her, oblivious of the storm, tossing 
  fallen and gathered crab apples to her team of pigs. The Wise Woman was a shape 
  shifter, and on this particular day she could have been mistaken for Nova Pilbeam, 
  that siren of the British screen who, in the 1930s, starred in Alfred Hitchcock's 
  <i>Young And Innocent</i> and the first version of <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much</i>. 
  </font></p>
<p><img src="pilbeam.jpg" width="180" height="234"></p>
<p><b>Nova Pilbeam</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">The prince explained his predicament. The Wise Woman, more 
  intent upon her pigs than upon this strutting royal git, made up some blather 
  about pauper's drool off the top of her head. Prince Fulgencio listened carefully, 
  scribbled some notes down with a biro in his filofax, remarked upon the Wise 
  Woman's resemblance to La Pilbeam, paid her with a pregnant pig he had found 
  wandering disconsolate in the Weird Woods, and pranced princely and preening 
  back to the palace. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There, he commanded his loathsome servants Odo and Udo to scour 
  the countryside collecting drool from paupers. In the teeth of the still-raging 
  storm, they did so, returning many hours later with two brimming iron pails. 
  The prince took the pails and swept in to the kitchen down in the basement of 
  the palace, and called for Old Ma Blunkett, his cook, to prepare a tincture 
  from the paupers' drool, just as the Wise Woman had prescribed. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Lightning flashed and thunder roared. Up in the playroom, still 
  cowering behind the arras, the Infanta Gertrude was startled to receive a message 
  on her metal tapping machine. It was from Professor Sigismundo, the wild-haired, 
  wild-eyed boffin who had been banished from the princedom a year before, and 
  who was now based at an important research laboratory far, far away. The Professor 
  suggested to Gertrude that she get her laptop and look up his website, where 
  she would find an essay subtitled <i>Paupers' Drool A Quack Potion And No Substitute 
  For Rational Explanation When Emboldening Tiny Ones Terrified By Electrical 
  Storms</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Twilight descended with no let up in the ferocious tempest. 
  The prince pranced into the playroom bearing a tray on which was set a brightly 
  gleaming goblet containing a tincture of paupers' drool, next to which lay some 
  scraps of bandage pressed into service as pads with which to dab the tincture 
  on to the forehead of the terrified quaking Infanta behind the arras. Yet she 
  was gone! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At midnight, the prince found his daughter at last. She was 
  skipping, laughing, gambolling and giggling in the open fields behind the palace 
  as thunderbolts crashed and lightning raked the heavens. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And so never again did the Infanta Gertrude cower behind an 
  arras during a thunderstorm, never again were Odo and Udo sent off with their 
  iron pails to collect the drool of paupers, and never again did the prince believe 
  a word he heard from the Wise Woman of the Weird Woods of Woobyhoobyhoo, who 
  was, in any case, too busy with her team of pigs to twit the prancing prince 
  from the crumbling palace in the faraway land of Gaar. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Found wandering in a confused state in Crucifix Lane, near

<p><font size="+1"><b>QUAYSIDE HARPY</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Ordinarily, when we think of harpies we think of Aello, Ocypete, 
  and Celaeno, or as she is sometimes known, Podarge, the three sisters of Greek 
  myth, bird-women who kept stealing, and befouling, food from Phineus and were 
  generally vicious, violent and cruel. Tennyson called them "These prodigies 
  of myriad nakednesses, / And twisted shapes of lust, unspeakable, / Abominable, 
  strangers at my hearth / Not welcome, harpies miring every dish" but that may 
  be more a reflection of the poet's fevered mental state than of the destructive 
  wind-spirits themselves. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It would certainly be a calumny upon the character of Beatrix 
  Cambodge, the so-called Quayside Harpy who haunted the harbour of O'Houlihan's 
  Wharf, that benighted, sludgesome seaside town a day's horse ride away from 
  Haemoglobin Towers, if of course you point your horse due south, and if of course 
  your horse is vimmy and fit, and not lame nor tubercular nor otherwise incapacitated. 
  You might think it a simple matter to keep your horse healthy, but no! Our equine 
  pals are subject to a host of terrible, terrible diseases! Lockjaw, Chronic 
  Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Equine Colic, Foal Pneumonia, Summer Seasonal 
  Recurrent Dermatitis, and Equine Wobbler Syndrome are among the ones to look 
  out for, next time you're hanging around at the stables, and there is a very 
  helpful website with the admirably informative address www.horse-diseases.com 
  to which you can refer. Don't forget to insert a hyphen between 'horse' and 
  'diseases', by the way, or you will go astray. As indeed, you will go astray 
  if you point your healthy horse in any direction other than south when riding 
  from Haemoglobin Towers to O'Houlihan's Wharf, in order to seek out Beatrix 
  Cambodge, the Quayside Harpy, who of course I am meant to be talking about. 
  Allow me just to prick the back of my hand with a long pin. That will help to 
  concentrate my mind. I usually use a ladies' antique hatpin for what some think 
  a melodramatic practice, but believe me, a tiny amount of bloodshed is well 
  worth it to keep awake and alert when one might otherwise nod off into snoozeworld, 
  particularly embarrassing when babbling into a microphone in the middle of a 
  live radio show. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There. I can read and dab at the puncture in my hand with a 
  disinfected rag at the same time, so let us move on. Beatrix Cambodge wanted 
  to be a harpy from girlhood, after she read about the mythical bird-women in 
  a little book entitled <i>Harpies, And Other Things That Fluttered At The Rim 
  Of Cooking Vessels In Ancient Greece</i>, by Dax Blib, the notorious children's 
  writer and historian who wrote from his cell in a big forbidding prison perched 
  on a promontory, where he was incarcerated for life after causing a series of 
  railway disasters. The book spurred the tiny girl's imagination, but it was 
  not as if hers was a humdrum childhood. Both of her parents were vampires, albeit 
  of a fairly nondescript variety. Not for them remote castles and sweeping black 
  capes and glistening crystal decanters from which to pour the blood they drank. 
  Mr and Mrs Cambodge were lowly sorts, reduced on occasion to squeezing the last 
  drop of gore from a fly or bluebottle thwacked with a rolled-up periodical. 
  Something of a wastrel, Beatrix's father tried to put it about that he was the 
  eponymous fiend in Charles Ives' song "Slugging A Vampire" (1902), though this 
  was clearly twaddle, his only - tenuous - connection with the composer being 
  a brief tenure hawking pencils and pencil sharpeners on the ferry across the 
  Housatonic at Stockbridge. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By the time Beatrix was born, the Cambodges had moved far, 
  far from the Housatonic, fetching up in a village that was scarcely more than 
  a clump of unsightly wooden sheds, a village so remote and dilapidated that 
  it did not even have a name. There is a surprising number of employment opportunities 
  in such a godforsaken spot for a wastrel and his wife who would shrivel to dust 
  at the first ray of sunlight come the dawn, although I can't for the life of 
  me think what they might be. I puzzled over this and a </font><font size="+1">kind 
  friend suggested to me that perhaps the Cambodges made a living by creeping 
  around at night laying traps for moles and badgers and weasels, so let us assume 
  that that is what they did, and that farmers thereabouts paid them well for 
  their exertions. That would at least explain how they came to be able to afford 
  to send the young Beatrix to a finishing school somewhere in the Habsburg Empire 
  where she first encountered the works of Dax Blib and set her heart on becoming 
  a harpy. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">She had wanted to be a bird. She learned that as the child 
  of vampires, she could never, ever be transformed into a starling or a linnet 
  or a nightjar or a nuthatch, not even into a bufflehead or a crow. It was a 
  cruel lesson but she did not let it crush her spirit. Instead she spent hours 
  with the finishing school seamstress, up in that weird cold crooked-beamed dusty 
  stale attic, stitching and stitching, until she had fashioned for herself a 
  pair of bright resplendent wings, with a span so wide when fully unfurled that 
  the old seamstress gave a gasp and swooned, clattering to the floor more like 
  a pile of dry sticks than a body of flesh and blood, and in her harpy heart 
  Beatrix exulted at her power. She would have liked to fly away from the school 
  by launching herself from the rooftops, but she was a sensible girl. She removed 
  her wings and folded them up and stowed them in a tote bag and carried on with 
  the day, through lessons in deportment and watercolour and piccolo and pastry 
  finesse and recital of twee verses by Dax Blib, and only when the time came 
  for the afternoon embroidery lesson did she flit away through a side door and 
  off into the mountains, while the staff and pupils went scurrying in search 
  of their seamstress, now stumbling stunned and blinded about the attic, bashing 
  into mannequins and tearing her paper-taut skin on scattered needles and pins 
  she could no longer see. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And Beatrix wandered in the mountains, stretching her taffeta 
  and organdie wings, striking fear into cowherds and their cows. Stories of the 
  flightless bird-woman circulated in the taverns. To assuage her wrath, offerings 
  of food were left for her in huts and shelters and hermitages. Sometimes, reckless 
  young pups armed themselves with their fathers' rifles and strode up into the 
  foothills, trying not to choke on the tobacco pipes they clenched between their 
  immature jaws, all bluster and braggadocio, hot for harpy hunting. Beatrix by 
  now had perfected a shriek of such ferocity that the blood of those who heard 
  it could have provided her vampire parents with plenty of ice popsicles. Experimenting 
  on the cows and cowherds, she had learned that a few energetic flappings of 
  her wings, accompanied by her shriek, could keep her safe from harm. Each and 
  every gun-toting young fool who came in her pursuit returned to his village 
  shrivelled and slobbering and deranged. Most of them had to be locked away in 
  gloomy cellars, their families' shameful secret, quietly fed on slops for years 
  and years, and never spoken of again. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps they were the lucky ones, for their village pals who 
  eschewed the harpy hunt for one reason or another were soon to perish in the 
  trenches, the Great War doing for them what it did for the Habsburg Empire in 
  which they had grown. And it was at the end of that terrible conflict that Beatrix 
  Cambodge at last came down from the mountains and made her way, vaguely and 
  without any real purpose, across war torn lands until one bright day in 1921 
  she fetched up on the quayside at O'Houlihan's Wharf, and there she stayed. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Beatrix realised soon enough that she inspired not one whit 
  of terror in the raddled and retired old sea dogs who haunted the quayside. 
  These were ancient and crusty mariners who chewed fish-heads when they were 
  not downing tankards of salt water and grog, and most of them had seen things 
  far more terrifying than Beatrix in their years upon the high seas. Pegleg Pinsent, 
  for example, over a hundred years old, with brine for blood, who now slumped 
  collapsed and crapulent in a quayside kiosk, was thought to have seen so many 
  ship-ghosts that he shook still, as he had been shaking for ninety years or 
  more, ever since as a callow cabin boy he had clambered into the crows' nest 
  of the <i>HMS Corrugated Cardboard</i> to be confronted with a sea-soaked ghoul 
  which intoned a dreadful litany of incomprehensible maritime twaddle into his 
  innocent ear. The ghoul was spindly, it pulsated like a jellyfish, it gave off 
  an odour of barnacles and rot and death, and it loomed above the tiny boy, its 
  boneless yet bony-seeming fingers clutching at his sleeve, leaving a trail of 
  slime which no amount of soaking in pail after pail of borax and boiling water 
  would ever expunge. At the end of that first voyage, the young Pinsent took 
  the tunic home to his Ma, supposing her laundry skills equal to any and every 
  stain, ghoul-smeared or otherwise, and that good woman let fall the shirt with 
  a shriek, a shriek compared to which Beatrix's harpy howl was like the song 
  of the nightingale she had, as an infant, wanted to be. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Aye, young miss," croaked Pegleg Pinsent as Beatrix sheltered 
  in his kiosk during a rainstorm on her first day on the quayside, "I saw many 
  a ship-ghost, and I saw ghost ships too. I saw shapes in the night sky that 
  should not have been there, and heard wailings and screams emerging from the 
  depths. And I smelled things no sailor ought ever smell, and touched what no 
  sailor ought ever touch. And all o'that on my very first voyage, miss, nine 
  years old and plying the foul oceans on the <i>Corrugated Cardboard</i>." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Now then, Mr Pinsent," said Beatrix, balancing a dainty teacup 
  on her lap, for harpy though she was she had not forgotten her Habsburg finishing 
  school manners, "You have spoken of eldritch experiences involving four of the 
  senses, but what of the fifth? Did you ever taste something no sailor ought 
  ever taste, as you would put it?" As she posed this question, she unfurled one 
  wing a little, just to see if it had any effect on the ancient mariner, whose 
  beard seemed to be alive with tiny crawling forms of marine life not easy to 
  identify. He did not pay her wing any attention as he replied. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hard tack biscuits riddled with worms, miss. That was my diet 
  then as it is my diet now," he said, "So the answer to your question has to 
  be 'no', I suppose." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I see," said Beatrix demurely, sweeping from her lap the crumbs 
  of a cake she had bought at a neighbouring kiosk. As she did so, she flapped 
  her one unfurled wing with a certain eerie menace, and prepared to display the 
  second. Pegleg Pinsent took no notice, for he was lost and shaking in ghoul-reverie, 
  occasionally slurping from a tin tumbler of rum, or brine, or rum and brine, 
  he could not tell anymore. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The interview petered out. Polite Beatrix thanked the old sea 
  dog for his time and shelter and mussed his filthy hair before striding out 
  onto the quayside deep in thought. Clearly her harpydom had failed to discombobulate 
  the grizzled marine person. It was true she had not essayed a shriek at him, 
  but with his long experience of sea-shriekings she surmised that his composure 
  would have remained unrattled. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Night fell on O'Houlihan's Wharf on that Wednesday. Under fat 
  shimmering stars, Beatrix huddled down under a greasy green tarpaulin she found 
  abandoned at a stretch of the quayside where auks and skuas gathered, far from 
  the hectic tavern raucous with shanties. She took off her wings and folded them 
  into her tote bag and placed it as a pillow, and lay down among birds, lulled 
  to sleep by the waves lapping against the rotting and crooked timber of the 
  jetty. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">She dreamed harpy dreams. Ferocious and merciless and demented, 
  she stole food from kings who had displeased their gods. Descending into the 
  infernal regions, she sunk her savage talons into the bellies of suicides. She 
  tormented unhappy sinners bound for Tartarus. She luxuriated in the filth and 
  stench of her island nest. And when she woke on Thursday morning, the auks and 
  skuas had flown away, and she was alone on the quayside, her wings packed in 
  her pillow. She jumped into the sea and swam, elegantly, as she had been taught 
  to do at finishing school, and then she climbed out and shook herself and preened, 
  like a seabird on a rock, and she retrieved her tote bag and put on her wings, 
  and shrieked and shrieked, and then she pottered off along the quayside towards 
  a crumbling ruinous hut where a signboard promised breakfast, and she sat down 
  at a rickety wooden table, its surface smeared with the slime of a ship's ghoul, 
  surrounded by sea dogs in tatty unravelling sweaters stiff with wax, their rubber 
  boots squelching and leaking, and she tucked in to a breakfast of cockles and 
  mussels and herring and lobster and squid and boiled water from a tide pool, 
  her cup alive with tiny wriggling marine beings, somehow happy at home here, 
  far from her finishing school in the mountains of what once had been the Habsburg 
  Empire, little Beatrix Cambodge, the quayside harpy of O'Houlihan's Wharf. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>DOBSON AND LONGEVITY </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I was preparing for yesterday's edition of <i>Hooting Yard 
  On The Air</i>, I received an email from listener Jonathan Coleclough. Actually, 
  Jonathan just forwarded an email to me, adding a note: &quot;The subject line 
  of the email below promised so much. But of course it was just spam. [Sigh]&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The subject line of the forwarded email was "Dobson and longevity" 
  and, indeed, what followed was twaddle. I wrote back to Jonathan as follows… 
  "I find it disconcerting that Dobson is haunting the less salubrious corners 
  of the world wide interweb, e'en from beyond the grave. That <i>... and longevity 
  </i>seems to be </font><font size="+1">trying to tell us something... something 
  spooky and almost Lovecraftian. I may have to investigate." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Of course I have not yet had time to make a full investigation, 
  to send agents from Haemoglobin Towers fanning out across the globe, with their 
  ponderous briefcases, beaver fur headgear, badger badges, and piercing eyesight, 
  but I have been able to give the matter some thought. Could it really be true 
  that the out of print pamphleteer cheated death? That beneath the funeral shroud, 
  that uncanny yellow festoonment cut from a bolt of cheap tarpaulin from a chandlery 
  in the brine-soaked hellhole of O'Houlihan's Wharf, a tarp stitched with cack-handed 
  embroidery of piddocks and toredos and winkles and periwinkles and strombuses 
  and whelks and loligos, that wrapped in it was not the dead Dobson but an imposter 
  or simulacrum? If so, if Dobson lived, where was he? He would be impossibly 
  old by now, creaking and crumbling. Was he trudging along alien pathways, anonymous, 
  in some distant land, his eyes - one beady, the other milky - fixed straight 
  ahead, an undead dead man plodding ever forward towards he knew not what? We 
  had all thought our dear pamphleteer a wisp, a fume borne upon the luminiferous 
  aether, the spindly frame he once inhabited discarded, hurled enwrapped in its 
  hideous tarpaulin from the worm-eaten jetty outside O'Houlihan's Wharf post 
  office into the boiling sea. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dobson and longevity, indeed. But perhaps, ill tempered and 
  hateful, he skulked in a booth somewhere, in the outskirts, feeding on biscuits 
  and berries and birds plucked in mid-flight from the air, sucking drops of rainwater 
  from the toggles of his duffel coat. Wherever he was, the undead Dobson remained 
  invisible to all who had known him, yet he somehow had the ability to seed the 
  world wide interweb with texts that none would ever read. Was he making some 
  skewed commentary upon all those unread out of print pamphlets that poured out 
  of him during the years before that thunder-wracked gathering in the bracken- 
  and bindweed-choked churchyard of St Bibblydibdib's when bells clanged lamentations, 
  and salt tears ran down the cheeks of even the most grizzled countenance? Where 
  was Dobson then? Did he scuttle from beneath the shroud when backs were turned? 
  Were there conspirators who replaced him with an effigy of felt and excelsior 
  and cardboard and rags? Who could such conspirators have been? Certainly Marigold 
  Chew cannot have been among them, for who could ever question the bleak desolation 
  with which she sported her widow's weeds? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If there is anyone to point a finger at, it would be Ned Blewitt. 
  Dobson had not known this urchin for long. As far as we know the two met just 
  an hour or so before Dobson's death, or his alleged death as we must now refer 
  to it. Dobson had left the house to buy a new picnic hamper, for it is a little-known 
  fact that he was fond of extravagant picnicking occasions, and much given to 
  hauling a hamper stuffed to the brim with cake and pomegranates and Limburger 
  cheese and pre-sliced slices of pemmican and brazil nuts and more brazil nuts 
  and even more brazil nuts and parsley and treacle pies and mashed potato and 
  suet puddings up punishing slopes and down inclines into declivities in the 
  hills where bats are legion and no other human being has ever trod. There, Dobson 
  would unpack his hamper and scoff his food unobserved, one of his own out of 
  print pamphlets propped open with a stick, chewing and reading and impervious 
  to the wind and the drizzle. Such excursions battered the ageing Dobson as much 
  as they battered his hamper, but a picnic hamper can be replaced. And so it 
  was, on that March morning, that Dobson pulled on his Belgian Cadet boots and 
  his souvenir cardigan from the Ayn Rand Exposition at Jakarta and strode off 
  towards the picnic supplies boutique at the perimeter of Old Farmer Frack's 
  fields on that patch of scrubland beyond Blister Lane. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next to the boutique was a kiosk operated by the Holy Sisters 
  Of Headaches And Dismay, an order of nuns who dispensed bowls of soup to passing 
  mendicants. As Dobson made his tottering progress towards picnickery, he was 
  buttonholed by one of the sisters… no, hang on, I've got the wrong day. The 
  kiosk was gone by then, obliterated by livid purple death rays from a spaceship 
  caught in a pocket of error in the continuum. I mean the space-time continuum, 
  I think. Anyway, where the soup kiosk once stood there was now a tent, pitched 
  there by The Mighty Alphonso, a roguish refugee from many a penny circus who 
  promised to astonish and astound the crowds with feats of legerdemain and prestidigitation, 
  accompanied by his assistant, Little Alphonso The Memory Man. But there were 
  no crowds that day, only Dobson, who hurried in through the tent flaps to avoid 
  an encounter with one of his creditors, it doesn't matter which one, who was 
  lurking outside the picnic boutique hoping to waylay the pamphleteer. Inside, 
  in the gloom, he came upon Little Alphonso rehearsing his latest show-stopper, 
  a recitation of a historical glossary of diseases. Peering over his shoulder 
  to ensure that he had not been followed, Dobson slumped into a pew, one of many 
  pews stolen from a cathedral by the ever-resourceful Mighty Alphonso, and hearkened 
  to the words of the diminutive urchin as he learned his lines. </font></p>

  massive dropsy)," recited Little Alphonso, "Apoplexy, Aphthae, Aphthous stomatitis,

  nascentium or neonatorum, Typhoid…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> "Oh for God's sake,&quot; shouted Dobson, &quot;I have heard 
  enough!" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Sorry, I didn't see you there," said Little Alphonso. "I am 
  Little Alphonso The Memory Man," he added, "Although of course that is a stage 
  name, and as you can see I am preparing for a stage performance later on today 
  when the rains tumble from the sky and the townsfolk hereabouts will seek shelter 
  in this our tent as you have done for a purpose unbeknown to me. You are staring 
  in perplexity at my pointy triangular cap, I see. Well, I always wear it for 
  rehearsals, for concealed within it, attached to my cranial integuments, are 
  wires which transmit brain-rays by invisible forces thus nourishing my mental 
  capacity and magnifying it a thousandfold. Would you like a conference pear?" 
  … and the urchin took two of the said fruits from a pocket and passed one to 
  Dobson. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bear in mind that Dobson had little more than an hour to live. 
  There has never been any suggestion that he was poisoned by the pear proffered 
  by Little Alphonso, whose real name, of course, was Ned Blewitt. If anyone had 
  the means and wherewithal to spirit the still living Dobson from beneath his 
  apparent funeral shroud, and to replace him with a counterfeit corpse, it was 
  Ned, and that is why my suspicions rest on him. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My investigations will continue. The next step is to ascertain 
  if The Mighty Alphonso may also have been involved. Unlike Little Alphonso, 
  The Mighty Alphonso was no mere stage name. That fact alone should give us pause. 
  And so I shall pause, not, like the doomed - or maybe not doomed - Dobson, to 
  gobble down a conference pear, but to stretch my legs in the direction of a 
  pie shop, to purchase a lemon meringue pie, and to carry it in its cardboard 
  packaging to a shrine where I will place it as an offering to appease the mad 
  and terrible gods before whom I bow down on Wednesday afternoons. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>THE POTATOES OF POTATOVAG</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"When did you last clap eyes on the potatoes of Potatovag?" 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was asked this question while standing on a bridge over a 
  muddy river in a high wind. I was wearing spats, as usual, minding my own business, 
  and humming the theme tune to the exciting TV quiz show <i>Cormorant Or Grebe?</i> 
  It was pouring with rain, but I didn't care, for atop my head I wore a sprightly 
  wide-brimmed hat, all golden, and decked with plastic chrysanthemums. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yes, dear reader, I was the spats-and-hat man you have heard 
  so many stories about. Remember when you were tiny, and mama tucked you up in 
  bed and opened the <i>Treasury Of Bedtime Tales For Pallid And Sickly Infants</i>, 
  and how you begged her to ignore the vapid rubbish about giants and dragons 
  and magic kingdoms and what have you, and to go straight to the stories of the 
  spats-and-hat man? That's me. But of course you would never have been told the 
  tale of this particular day that found me standing on a windswept bridge in 
  a downpour being questioned about the potatoes of Potatovag, because it was 
  only yesterday, and there has not yet been time for my scribe to boswell an 
  account ready for the printing presses. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In truth, I have a team of scribes, who work in relays. One 
  follows me about, morning, noon and night, scribbling down my doings. One sits 
  at a desk in the chalet, making a fair copy of yesterday's scribblings. One 
  types up the fair copy in the chalet's computer pod. One supervises the printing 
  of the typed copy. One carts the printed copies around to all the kiosks where 
  they can be purchased. And one has a day of rest, often spent studying the swans 
  downriver. I am a lucky spats-and-hat man to have so many Boswells at my beck 
  and call, even if they can be a tiresome bunch. Let me briefly describe their 
  shortcomings. Hoobington is curdled and indiscreet. Tack is blind. Dalewinton 
  has pins in his legs and a metal plate in his skull and his favourite tipple 
  is the boiled blood of ducks. Poop is a nincompoop. Hudibras is a swivel-eyed 
  Stalinist maniac whose cardigans always bear traces of yesterday's sausages. 
  The sixth boswell is actually named Boswell, or rather, Boswellboswell. This 
  one topples over far too often for my liking. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So, yesterday it happened that I was accompanied by this Boswellboswell 
  person. There I was, standing on the bridge in the rain, humming, and peering 
  over across the fields to where the phlox and pansies and pinks, the hellebore 
  and hollyhocks, the marigolds, verbascum and charlock and mimosa, spurge, gorse 
  and erica, the lupins, the daffodils, the broom and japonica, the creeping jenny, 
  the old man's beard and the cow parsley, the speedwell and flax and dock and 
  hops and oxlip and crocuses and teasel, and the geraniums and foxgloves and 
  fleabane and jonquil and lobelia grow in such heavenly profusion, when the person 
  from Potatovag drew up beside me in his death-trap jalopy, and shouted "When 
  did you last clap eyes on the potatoes of Potatovag?" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I made my reply, with all the wit and brio you have come to 
  expect from the spats-and-hat man… but Boswellboswell chose that very moment 
  to topple over yet again, and as we were on a bridge, he toppled into the muddy 
  river, and he sank, and with him sank the words I spoke to the person from Potatovag, 
  words now lost forever, never to find their place in a new edition of the <i>Treasury 
  Of Bedtime Tales For Pallid And Sickly Infants</i>, infants now who will be 
  deprived of a thin, weak smile of glee before falling to a snooze in their iron 
  sickbeds, a snooze from which - who knows? - they may never awake. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>GLUE : SOME DO'S AND DON'TS </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Far too many people simply don't understand how to make the 
  best use of glue. For that reason, here at Hooting Yard we have taken it upon 
  ourselves to educate our readers by providing some cardinal do's and don'ts. 
  Read, ponder, and digest, and never again will you stand accused of glue-related 
  tomfoolery. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Never use glue to stick your head to something it ought 
  not be glued to. For example, you should avoid gluing your head to the nest 
  of a being which will suck out your brains. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Do not confuse glue with gum. Some gum can be chewed - indeed, 
  such gum is often called 'chewing gum'. You cannot chew glue, and you will rue 
  the day you do, should you be such a nincompoop so to do. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Make sure you read Dobson's various pamphlets on the subject 
  of glue, all of which are highly informative. I particularly recommend <i>The 
  Adhesive Properties Of Six Hundred Different Types Of Glue, With Diagrams</i> 
  (out of print, but sometimes salvageable from rubbish tips in the vicinity of 
  glue-making factories). This pamphlet has been condemned by a number of commentators 
  as being a farrago of lies and bile, written by Dobson in order to exact revenge 
  upon one of his enemies, but you should read it anyway, for even if the so-called 
  facts with which it is packed are false and inaccurate, you will still learn 
  much enabling you to hold your own in any argument concerning glue. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. Some glues are designed for very specific purposes. For 
  example, library paste is thick and glutinous, whereas mucilage is thin, clear 
  and gelatinous. Don't get the two mixed up, or you may be beset by adherence 
  issues, and none of us wants to face such a circumstance, bereft of glue-knowledge, 
  alone and puny in a cold and pitiless universe. No! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That is quite enough about glue for today. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1"><b>SHRIVELLED</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When I removed the shrivelled human head from the burlap sack, 
  my first thought was that there must have been foul play, as detectives like 
  to call it. But I am not a detective, and foul play seemed incongruous in this 
  sun-dappled meadow splattered with buttercups, tansy and wild hollyhocks, under 
  a gorgeous blue sky. Just before stumbling upon the sack I had been singing 
  at the top of my voice, singing a happy song, one of my own devising, a paean 
  of praise to bees, extolling the virtues of these splendid buzzy insects, and 
  I was dressed like a bee, sort of, in a black and yellow hooped jumper, and 
  black leggings, and a black cap upon my head. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There was no cap or hat of any sort on the shrivelled head 
  I took from the sack, just a few strands of filthy matted hair. I sat on the 
  grass and took a pair of snippy butcher's scissors out of my pocket and gave 
  the shrivelled head a much needed haircut, and I made a little pile of the clippings 
  on a patch of bare soil, and set fire to it with a match, and it blazed oh so 
  briefly, sparking and crackling, and then all that was left was a trace of ash. 
  I plopped the shrivelled head back into the burlap sack, swung it over my shoulder, 
  and headed off towards Old Farmer Frack's pig farm, singing lustily. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">No one knew how old Old Farmer Frack was, and no one could 
  remember a time when he was not squelching about in the mud, at all hours of 
  the day and night, raising his pigs. As farms go, it was a tiny farm, but Old 
  Farmer Frack was a giant of a man, by the standards of that land, and his pigs 
  grew to giants too, under his care. It was a mystery how he made his living, 
  for he never took his pigs to market to sell them. When they reached a size 
  that made them too big for the tiny farm, he drove them up into the hills and 
  let them loose. That is why dutiful parents warn their children against going 
  a-wandering alone in the hills, and tell terrifying tales of giant rampaging 
  pigs which capture and carry off misbehaved infants in their big chomping jaws. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I found Old Farmer Frack engulfed in a fug of culinary fumes 
  in his kitchen. He was preparing his lunch, a concoction of jugged hare, devilled 
  kidneys, and blancmange, and he was cursing like a sailor, for he had inadvertently 
  jugged the kidneys and devilled the hare. One of his pigs - not yet titanic 
  in stature - was rooting around the skirting boards, looking perhaps for beetles 
  or other creeping things. I patted the pig on its shanks, if pigs have shanks, 
  and placed my sack on the table. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"This might interest you, Old Farmer Frack," I said, helping 
  myself to a tumbler's worth of water from the spigot. Except for his maritime 
  curses, learned when he was but a boy, Old Farmer Frack was a man of few words. 
  He eyed the sack, and he eyed me, and he eyed his spigot. Then he put down his 
  jug full of kidneys and opened the sack with unnecessary vigour, causing the 
  shrivelled human head to roll across the table and topple to the floor. To its 
  credit, the pig ignored it. Old Farmer Frack stared at the shrivelled head and 
  immediately made the sign of the cross. I had no idea he was a Papist pig farmer! 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I just snipped the gory locks off this gory find," I said, 
  "And then I burned them!" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I stooped to lift the head back on to the table, but Old Farmer 
  Frack clouted me with main force and I crumpled to the floor. Unconscious for 
  a few seconds, I came to with the pig's snout in my face. The shrivelled human 
  head was perilously close to one of the pig's cloven feet, and I feared that 
  it would be crushed should the pig become excitable and begin stamping. Thinking 
  fast, I reached my hand up and patted the pig soothingly. Previously, when I 
  had patted its shanks, or what I believed to be its shanks, I had done so in 
  a perfunctory manner, much as one might chuck a dog under the chin. Now I willed 
  the placatory forces of Blotzmann Movement Number Seven (a) into my hand, that 
  I might communicate absolute calm. At this point Old Farmer Frack smashed me 
  on the head with a spade. Typical of a farmer, I thought, to keep a spade in 
  his kitchen. </font><font size="+1">And then I passed out, for hours. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was woken by the unbearable sound of a transistor radio blaring 
  into my ears. 'Unbearable', because on Radio Pipsqueak it was, apparently, U2 
  Day, and the noise assailing me was the voice of the preposterous Paul "Nobo" 
  Hewson, a Christian Irish millionaire given to taking court action to retrieve 
  a pair of trousers and a hat<font color="#FF0000"><b>*</b></font>. I lunged 
  to deaden the sound in any way I could, and saw Old Farmer Frack looming above 
  me, his jowls smeared with vestiges of devilled hare, jugged kidneys, and blancmange. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"You brought me the wrong head," he said, lugubriously. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>HIATUS </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We've had another hiatus here at Hooting Yard. The chief reason 
  for this is that I agreed to take part in an experiment and have spent the last 
  two months living as an otter. Only yesterday did Professor Tadaaki pull up 
  at the riverbank in his big yellow rusty jeep to tell me that I had misheard 
  his instructions and wasted valuable research time splashing about to no apparent 
  purpose. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I towelled myself dry and traipsed home in a bit of a temper, 
  because the good Prof did not see fit to tell me what it was that I had misheard. 
  Was I meant to have been living as a hatter? As a nutter? Who knows? Anyway, 
  I am home now, and have already started scribbling prose to provide my loyal 
  readers with entertainment, instruction, and a diversion from autumn thoughts 
  of knitwear and shove-ha'penny. Now read on… </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1"><b>UNTITLED WORK IN PROGRESS </b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Look at this man coming up the path, the waterlogged path. 
  They call him the district line dentist. He has dentistry in his blood. He has 
  blood on his shoes. Blood on his shoes, talc in his hair, and as he walks along 
  the waterlogged path he is shouting and shouting and shouting. The blood on 
  his shoes is still wet and warm from the slaughtering he has been engaged in, 
  up in the hills, where the district line never goes. It is not the blood of 
  humans. There are no humans in those hills, only cardboard figures, and hardboard 
  figures, and balsa wood figures, and an enormous colony of very, very frightening 
  birds, like savage and pitiless birds from an ancient myth, except that these 
  birds are real, fat with feathers, and absolutely terrifying. You may have seen 
  their like on the sides of buses in Pointy Town, for it was images of similar 
  birds that were used in that ill-conceived advertising campaign for a brand 
  new type of fizzy and frothing detergent pill which, it was claimed, would put 
  more pep into your pots and pans. We know that banging pots and pans is a traditional 
  method of scarifying birds, but it would not work with these birds, the ones 
  that perch on the cardboard and hardboard and balsa wood figures in the hills 
  from which the man they call the district line dentist has just descended, with 
  blood on his shoes and a song in his heart. That is why he is shouting. He has 
  a song in his heart but he cannot sing. His song is about the sad final days 
  of Edgar Allan Poe, and the chorus replicates that neurasthenic writer's dying 
  words…. "Reynolds! Reynolds! Reynolds!" That is what the district line dentist 
  is shouting as he clumps along the path in his blood-soaked shoes. He clumps 
  with a limp, for his legs are of uneven length, only just, but decisively so. 
  He was not born that way. When he was a cherubic bonny baby both his legs were 
  measured, and they were found by several independent authorities to be identical 
  in length. Something happened to him between then and now to mar his symmetry, 
  something he has always blamed on the ferocious birds up in the hills. That 
  is why he is such a bitter man and a bird hater. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He hated birds, but he was fond of moles. He had a little toy 
  mole made of cambric and string, a puppet you could call it, which sat on a 
  china plate on the dresser in the parlour of the boarding house by the seaside 
  where he lived. Seeing a mole on a plate, many people chided the district line 
  dentist that it looked as if he wanted the mole for his dinner, albeit that 
  it was only a cambric and string toy. The presence of a knife and fork alongside 
  the plate served only to emphasise this misapprehension, but that was part of 
  his plan, or I should say part of one of his many plans. Dentistry was in his 
  blood, but he no longer practised that trade, for he was an old, old man, retired 
  to a seaside boarding house, a boarding house named after Ray Milland, the film 
  star who memorably appeared in <i>The Man With X-Ray Eyes</i>. The gardens of 
  the boarding house were riotous with foxgloves, and as you may know, foxgloves 
  are poisonous to moles. At least, that is the case in the land of which I speak, 
  it may or may not be the case elsewhere in the boundless universe. But of course 
  the foxgloves which bloomed in the Ray Milland boarding house gardens were not 
  harmful to the district line dentist's mole, for it was but a toy, a plaything, 
  sat on its plate on the dresser. The cutlery aligned next to the plate was of 
  exquisite workmanship, of the finest metal, manufactured, according to legend, 
  by gnomes, though</font> <font size="+1">the tales told of these gnomes were 
  full of holes, and every version was different. Sometimes the gnomes were said 
  to live under a big bright mountain far away, and sometimes they were said to 
  spend their lives jetting from one paradise island to another, making their 
  knives and forks and spoons during stopovers in airport snack bars. In truth, 
  nothing can have been more mundane than the actual making of the cutlery, and 
  gnomes played no part in it. Every last teaspoon and sugar tong was made in 
  a great grim factory, guarded by beagles, plonked in a field at the end of the 
  district line, Hallelujah Field, where no grass grew, only weeds and tares. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are storms in teacups and barn-storms, but it is a very 
  particular sort of storm that engages our attention now. Henry Cow recorded 
  a piece entitled <i>Bittern Storm Over Ulm</i>, the title taken from a passage 
  in one of Charles Fort's compendia of anomalous phenomena, and likewise, we 
  are dealing with a storm of birds. For up in the hills where the district line 
  never goes, a surge of magnetism convulsed the colony of terrifying birds, and 
  they filled the sky, screeching and shrieking, maddened beyond measure. Hearing 
  the racket, the dentist clumped to a halt on the waterlogged path. His shoes 
  were steeped in the blood of slaughtered birds, but for each one he had killed, 
  dozens more had appeared, flapping in from who knows where, gathering in the 
  hills, perched and brooding and awaiting the burst of magnetic energy sending 
  them into a storm in the sky. But this was Pointy Town, not Ulm, and these were 
  no bitterns. And the waterlogged path that came down from the hills led, in 
  its meandering way, to a cluster of huts on the beach, huts that once belonged 
  to boat builders, Noah figures whose beards were stiff with the salt of the 
  sea, long gone now, the boats they built shattered and broken, wooden fragments 
  scattered across the sands, eaten by worms, as those who built the broken boats 
  were themselves devoured as they lay in their tombs in the pretty churchyard 
  of Saint Bibblydibdib's, hard by the beach, and popular with poets. Sand worms 
  and earthworms, and the work they do, have been ignored by the graveyard poets 
  of Pointy Town, and for that they should be ashamed. The district line dentist 
  was heading for the huts where once boats had been built, for there he believed 
  he would find sanctuary from the vengeful birds. Pelange and Froumier are among 
  those who have written authoritatively about ritual appeasement of bird gods, 
  and while I am not suggesting for one moment that there is a divinity lurking 
  in the breasts of those screeching horrors in the sky over the hills - the sky 
  now black with their swooping, flapping savagery, incidentally - yet we would 
  do well to recall, in particular, Pelange's nostrum regarding protecting shrouds. 
  But of course, that popinjay writer knew nothing of birds driven bonkers by 
  eerie magnetic forces which we still do not fully understand. Luckily for him, 
  the district line dentist did. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was no accident that the church by the beach was consecrated 
  to Saint Bibblydibdib, for he was the patron saint of something or other resonant 
  of marine life. He is one of those saints for whom there is no convincing evidence 
  of his actual existence, and it may be that he was simply a phantom shimmering 
  in vapours from the brains of seaside mystics. Buried in the churchyard was 
  one such mystic, a wise woman known as the Woohoowoodiwoo Woman. Legend in those 
  parts held that she it was who had fallen foul of the birds in the hills, and 
  had pelted the old boat builders with potatoes until they ceased to build boats, 
  and that she had done so because she lived in mortal fear not only of the birds 
  but of the sea. Hideous aquatic beings haunted her nightmares, from which she 
  would awake crying "Woohoowoodiwoo!", hence the name by which she was known. 
  Intriguingly, on 22nd November 1963, the day of the Kennedy Assassination, she 
  awoke screaming "Reynolds! Reynolds! Reynolds!", like Edgar Allan Poe on his 
  deathbed, but we do not know why, and nor did she ever divulge her dream, even 
  to the district line dentist, who did her bridge canal work, and praised the 
  enamel of her molars, and was her confidante and, some said, her inamorata, 
  all those years ago, before the frightening birds haunted the hills, and while 
  boats were still built in the cluster of huts on Pointy Town beach, the huts 
  clustered between two coastal features called impagu and sacketysack. She was 
  invariably dressed, even festooned, in those days, in a maroon shawl, the Woohoowoodiwoo 
  Woman. Maroon, too, was the colour of the plumage of the most frightening of 
  the frightening birds. Did the shawl act as her protective shroud, a la Pelange? 
  The district line dentist suffered from Daltonism, or colour blindness, and 
  he knew not what maroon was, nor how it differed from blue. As we know, maroon 
  and blue are the two 'foundation' colours in the Blotzmann Register. </font></p>
