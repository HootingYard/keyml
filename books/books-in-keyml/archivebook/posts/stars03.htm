<p><font size="+1"><b>CHAPTER THREE</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>THE MANUFACTURE OF TOOTHPASTE</i>, by Gervase Pint, is a 
  book which I would recommend to all students of bodily hygiene: lay readers, 
  too, will find a close examination of its contents highly rewarding. Pint was 
  a student of the great <i>dentifricist</i> Lamouche, and poured the best part 
  of his life into this matchless tome, a copy of which I have to hand as I write.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The first six hundred and forty nine pages of Pint's book 
  are devoted to a disquisition upon two popular toothpaste recipes - camphorated 
  and myrrh. The former is comprised of one pound of prepared chalk, and one or 
  two drachms of camphor. The camphor must be finely powdered and, after mixing 
  with a little wine, pounded into a big splodge with the chalk. The latter is, 
  for amateurs, a simpler recipe: the mingling of two ounces of myrrh with a pound 
  of powdered cuttlefish. How prosaic the bare details: yet how world-shuddering 
  the poetry of Pint's commentary! </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The workers at the Port of Tongs toothpaste factory were presented 
  with a copy of Pint's book upon their recruitment, and were expected to learn 
  it by heart during their first month: failure to do so resulted in automatic 
  dismissal, without the right of appeal. Draconian such regulations may be, but 
  as a confirmed Pintist I cannot bring myself to quarrel with them. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While I have been telling you this, the action has moved forward. 
  The ferry has docked at the Port of Tongs, and our three detectives, suitably 
  disguised, have holed up in a cave high in the purple hills which surround the 
  three landward sides of that perfectly square town. On with the tale: </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">His reconnoitering mission accomplished, Fig reported back 
  to his colleagues. There was nothing for it, he announced, but to pose as toothpaste 
  factory workers, until such time as they should see what they should see. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"What?" snapped Brewster, brusquely. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"What I mean," said Fig, "Is that if we are to track down the 
  Patch album, we must wheedle our way onto the toothpaste factory premises, and 
  keep our eyes peeled. Remember," he added, "I came upon a clue which led me 
  directly to this toothpaste-a-go-go: if we are to know where to go from here, 
  we will need to have our wits about us, and keep a sharp look-out for the next 
  clue." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Spare us the dramatics, Fig," said Brewster, "I say we storm 
  the place, brandishing cutlasses." </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The poor postie had the casting vote. Sensibly, he telephoned 
  me for guidance. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Side with Fig," I advised, "He knows so much about these things." 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I replaced the receiver in its cradle, Scrimgeour lolloped 
  in, bearing a couple of bottles of 1922 Bestial Freak. I sank back on the pillows. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Have you looked in on Mister Patch this morning?" I asked. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Yes, sir" said Scrimgeour, in his smarmy voice. I couldn't 
  bear him. Not only did he call me "sir", but he fawned and scraped, treated 
  my mother with respect (!), and never touched a drop. The final item in the 
  charge-sheet against him was that he was well in with my odious aunts. I was 
  highly suspicious of him, convincing myself for some time that he was a paid 
  agent, employed to spy on me and to reveal my malingerment: the thought of being 
  packed off back to school was so horrifying that I was actually ill for a few 
  weeks. But no, Scrimgeour was merely a forelock-tugging sniveller of the worst 
  sort. Countless were the times I sacked him, only for my commands to be overridden 
  by Maisie or Daisy, to whom, as he put it, he "owed obeisance, sir". Ach! Spit, 
  spit, spit. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was so used to having a retainer of the Patch or Brewster 
  stamp, a man with whom I could happily get drunk while execrating my family, 
  that I am afraid I went into something of a decline during this period. I became 
  listless and irritable. Even my stamp albums held no allure for me. I languished 
  in my bed, groaning quietly to myself, hating everything. Weeks went by in a 
  kind of haze. Then, at the height of spring, I received a letter from Fig: </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Dear Young Scalliwag,</i> it read, <i>You will no doubt 
  be amused that I write these lines while clothed in the apparel of a toothpaste-factory 
  worker: to wit, one bib, one tunic woven of goat-hair, a pair of surprisingly 
  comfortable yellow cheesecloth trousers, alarming socks, great sturdy boots, 
  and a protective facemask not unlike a fencing instructor's. Brewster and Binnie</i> 
  - ah, so that was the postman's name! - <i>are similarly attired. Now, wipe 
  the smile off your face, and I shall apprise you of the latest developments 
  in the case. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>For the past six weeks we have been posing, with some success, 
  as ordinary workers at this toothpaste factory. My job is to slam huge iron 
  clackingtons on to a series of oblong paste-receptacles carried past on motorised 
  railings, each container then being lowered to the hardening chamber, where 
  Brewster is employed to place them in groups of twelve on a sprung plinth, the 
  control mechanism of which is situated in an adjoining room behind protective 
  glass panels, wherein Binnie manually rotates several metallic wheels, the action 
  of which impels the plinth-load up through a chute to the whirlbath. What happens 
  after that is unknown to us. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>At snack-times and other rest periods we have been diligent 
  in following up the clue which led us here. Binnie in particular is indefatigable. 
  Yesterday, for example, he pretended to be sick, and spent the day not, as our 
  masters thought, in the gleaming white Parlour for the Ailing, but scurrying 
  like a mad thing through the administrative building, disguised as an inspector 
  of utensils. Thus he was able to take microfilm photographs of a number of documents 
  which may or may not prove pertinent.</i> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The thing is, Fig prattles. I shall spare you the next seven 
  or eight pages of his twaddle: towards the end, however, there was a nugget 
  of interest: </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Now, boy, you will doubtless be wondering why on earth we 
  are hanging around in this little hotbed of toothpastery. I will tell you. From 
  the earliest days of the case, I have been convinced of one startling idea: 
  that Professor Underlip and Walter Mad were - perhaps still are - one and the 
  same man. To date, this is only conjecture, but I sense that, somewhere in the 
  bowels of this godforsaken factory, I will find the proof. And when I do, I 
  will be one step closer to finding Mister Patch's pre-adhesive stamp collection. 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The letter was signed <i>Yours very sincerely, Stanley Fig. 
  PS: When sending further instalments of money, please address to my alias, Vercingetorix 
  Sepulveda, c/o Zone 94, The Toothpaste Factory, Hobgoblin Boulevard, The Port 
  of Tongs. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Wearily, I shoved another few hundred panes into an envelope 
  and sent Scrimgeour off to the postbox. Upon his return, he handed me a telegram. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Proof found. Onward to Wint. The chase is on. Fig. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My spirits were lifted. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Scrimgeour," I said, "Fetch me a jeroboam of Stomach-Churning 
  Sour Slop!" </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I do not wish to incommode you sir," he replied, "But your 
  aunts have forbidden me to supply you with beverages of an alcoholic nature." 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If I were a fictional character, I may have said "Gadzooks!" 
  or something of the sort. Instead, I berated Scrimgeour with a litany of abuse 
  unsuitable for family reading. There is a sub-plot brewing here, the climax 
  of which will find the narrator having his aunts drowned in a handy duckpond. 
  Assume that this has already happened, and, if you come upon Maisie or Daisy 
  later in the narrative, you can gloat in the foreknowledge of their eventual 
  destruction. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had to think fast. I had not stirred from my room for sixteen 
  months, and I was blowed if I was going to be forced from my bed to collect 
  my own supplies of hooch. Besides, I didn't have a key to the cellars. A stratagem 
  was called for, obviously. Rack my brains as I might, I could not think of one. 
  I sucked on the bottle of tap-water with which Scrimgeour had taunted me, and 
  fell into a swoon. </font></p>
