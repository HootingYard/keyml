\chapter*{Foreword}

THIS IS ANOTHER fat collection of stories, all of which have been read aloud on ``Hooting Yard On The Air'', my weekly radio show on Resonance104.4FM. Most of these pieces were written in the latter part of 2008 and 2009, and this volume acts as a companion to the earlier anthologies \emph{Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude \& Pippy Bags} and (the much thinner) \emph{Befuddled By Cormorants}.

Thanks as ever to the staff and sound engineers at Resonance, and to those readers and listeners who have supported me, not least financially through their contributions to the Hooting Yard Fund For Distressed Out Of Print Pamphleteers.

The cover design is by Pansy Cradledew, without whom my life would be a puny and curdled thing.

He has already been thanked in my previous books for his unflagging and inestimable devotion to the cause of Hooting Yard's global dominion, but it is long overdue that I dedicate a book to Salim Fadhley. This one is for him.
