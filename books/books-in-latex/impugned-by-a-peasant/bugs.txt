FOREWORD
Insert double line space after end of text and "Frank Key / London 2010"
no indentation on "Frank Key" or "London 2010"



The following pieces begin with quotations, so there should be a line space after the quotation, and the next para (beginning with caps) should not be indented:
ALONG THE BANKS OF THE SMEM
LITTLE RUSKIN EPISODE ONE
FURTHER ADVENTURES OF LITTLE RUSKIN
SWANS IN THUNDERSTORMS
THE FREEZING COACHMAN
DOBSON'S CARD INDEX
SHIPWRECK IS EVERYWHERE

Similarly, these pieces begin with a line that's not part of the story, so insert a line space and next para (beginning with caps) unindented:
PRUDENCE FOXGLOVE SUNDAY SCHOOLS
IN SEARCH OF PLUNKETT
PALLID ADA THE CRIPPLED HEIRESS


Other amendments:

BLODGETT BOILS MY LADY KENT'S PUDDING
Paras 3-5 are a quotation (emph'd). Insert a line space before and after.

UNSUNG VICTORIAN GENIUS
This is almost entirely a dialogue, so I think it should be set out with a line space inserted between each speech, and no indentations at all.

SEVEN STINTS
Insert line space between each stint, and no indentation at all.

LUGUBRIOUS FOOL
Insert line space before and after dialogue between Fulgencio & Kaplan

THE MUSCULAR FOOL AND THE OTHER FOOL
There is an asterisked footnote on the first page, so the footnote itself should appear at the bottom of that page, not at the end of the story.
