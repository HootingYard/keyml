<p><b>Q - Where is Hooting Yard?</b></p>
<p>A - Not far from Bodger's Spinney. Walk along Amnesiac Lane, taking a left
turn just past the post office. Follow the hedge until you come to the gates of
Haemoglobin Towers, then head for the kiosk. Hooting Yard is on your right, by
the duckpond.</p>

<p><b>Who is this Frank Key person who seems to know so much about Hooting
Yard?</b></p>
<p>A - Would you like a potted biography?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q - I certainly would.</b></p>
<p>A - He was born in a lighthouse. When still tiny, he was attacked by a flock
of demented bitterns. He had a troubled relationship with his sister, who stank
of camphor. On reaching adulthood, Frank decamped to Concrete, Texas, where he
spent some years as an undertaker's mute. He then moved to Splat in Cornwall,
which can be found on most Ordnance Survey maps if you look carefully. Following
an injection carried out by his doctor - who was also one of the towering
figures of post-war Bolivian water polo - Frank became colour blind. He now
lives on the upper floors of an abandoned hotel, where he is often visited by
his sister, still reeking of camphor, who entertains him with piccolo recitals
and the chewing of brazil nuts. Frank lists his hobbies as ponds, tin and
badgers, but not necessarily in that order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q - That's absolutely fascinating. Is it true?</b></p>
<p>A - Is there a chaffinch on the roof of the hotel?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q - I'll go and have a look .....</b></p>
<p>A - Ah, but not before returning to the
