<p>This site was last updated at some point in the 17th century. Unless, of
course, you read the  <i>Independent On Sunday</i>which says that Hooting Yard
is "an attic crazily packed with the  aerostats, flanges, cobalt and
general late-Victorian flotsam of British comic surrealism". Who am I to
disagree with a national newspaper?</p>
