This is resonance 104 point four FM excuse me, my name is Frank Kate with a head cold. And this is hooting yard on the air. exactly five years and two days ago, on the 14th of April 2004 was the first ever edition of hooting yard on the air. So this is the Thank you, john. So a little clap from the jolly engineer. And so this is the fifth anniversary show. Unfortunately, I don't have a bottle of champagne to pop open, so you'd hear a great sound effect. But I do have a beaker of air rated lettuce water, and I'll be taking dainty sips from that. throughout the show as a way of celebrating this momentous occasion. How many hours of babbling Have there been? Anyway, here's another 28 or 29 minutes or so babble. Beginning with this it's a quotation from Rene do miles novel mount analog, as novel of symbolically authentic non Euclidean adventures in mountain climbing, translated by Roger Shattuck, originally published in 1952, and the trans English translation in 1959, ran idi mile, mountain along along the path glued to the window panes or hung on the bushes or dangling from the ceiling, so that all free space was put to maximum use. Hundreds of little placards were displayed. Each one carried a drawing a photograph or inscription, and the whole constituted a veritable Encyclopedia of what we call human knowledge. a diagram of a plant cell menda lafc periodic table of the elements, the keys to Chinese writing a cross section of the human heart, Lorenz's transformation formula, each planet and its characteristics, fossil remains of the horse species in series, Mayan hieroglyphics, economic and demographic statistics, musical phrases, samples of the principal plant and animal family's crystal specimens, the ground plan of the Great Pyramid brain diagrams, logistic equations, phonetic charts of the sounds employed in all languages, maps, genealogies, everything in short, which would fill the brain of a 20th century Pico della mirandola. The astonishing thing about the little placard displayed by Father so goal, the professor of mountaineering in ran a doe miles novel is how similar they are to the immense card index maintained by Dobson upon which he reported relied when writing his out of print pamphlets. Dobson would have approved to the professor's method of displaying the cards at least sometimes. One of the pamphleteers more irritating characteristics was his inability to settle on the keeping of his cards. At times, like so goal in the novel, he picked them up on every available surface, then a frenzy would take him and he would tear them all down and shove them into one of his innumerable cardboard boxes. marigold two reports that Dobson spent hours upon hours arranging the cards when they were in their boxes, ordering and reordering them according to various abstruse cataloguing systems. No sooner was he done, done, he would once again tip them out of their boxes and pin them up on walls and screens and pinboards and what have you. And of course, all the time, he was adding new cards to the collection. March of Dobson's card collection perished in the potato building fire, and ever since researchers have been attempting to reconstruct it, this is probably an impossible task. But that doesn't stop them trying. The reward would be to create a sort of cardboard model of the innards of Dobson's pulsating brain, not to be confused with the cardboard model of the Cara pace of his brain, which is currently being carted around the globe by a devoteam. According to the timetable posted on The cardboard brain of Dobson World Tour website, the cart with its precious content is on route to one of the masses at the moment, either skeg or done or foul.

There was a flap of controversy some months ago when a previously unheard of Dobson east, one bunco troll, claimed to have recreated an accurate cardboard boxes worth of index cards. After painstaking study of clues littered throughout the pamphlet is out of print works, and a visit to a stationery shop. The mysterious troll placed on display the results of his research. purist suspicions were aroused by the fact that one had to pay an exorbitant fee to get through the door of the Nissen hut, where the exhibition was held. Inside however, there was an attempt to reflect the pamphleteers indecision with half the cards gummed to the walls, and half crammed into a cardboard box. The cards themselves to demonstrated the variety that was characteristic of Dobson's collection, as it was a father so goals, one visited of the heart later to denounce the show as a quote, despicable ferragosto of falsehood, an innocent heart to Window lessness and, quote, made a list of the cards he saw. Instructions for the proper care of ostriches in captivity. street map of Skegness photo of a duck escaped from rule pig Brian diagram boot glace aglet comparisons, lopped Pol Pot pop tart tune and rent stuff widows buttons, tips on bell ringing sandwich paste reviews, drawing of ghost railway station smudge voltage statistics unsalaried napkin from a remote canteen gunshot punctures drew from a pauper old halibuts hat measurements imagined report rate of tech one witek muggle Tony and dinner menu. Fatal Mike microbes when it peg pumpkin is cravat, not schema, Potter's duffel bag toggle analysis, Starling feathers, Starling brooch, desiccated plum pulp, rubberized atomic sackcloth scrap, latch, pins, bolt, set of amazing stains, devotional card of sight abode whoa arguably the patron saint of monkeys periodic table of the crumpled gravy recipe tabulation of Orwellian egg count snapshot of Schubert's grave mezzotint of Schubert's boot, handwritten screed of gibberish lock of pontiffs hair, gummy ik definition definitions of flotsam and jetsam and plankton and krill and lemon meringue pie. The dust of death, the dewdrops of doom, pointless scribblings the Dobson list who made the list whose name has never been made public was initially impressed by the exhibition. A few days later, however, in a letter to the daily Nesbitt spotter, he got into a fit of the Vipers about the window lessness of the Nissen heart, pointing out that depending on the disposition of the purlins, it's quite simple to insert windows into the hearts frame. It is rare for one who spent his life studying Dobson also to have expertise in the construction of huts, whether Nissen or not, and this suggests that we may be able to identify the writer if anyone can be bothered to sift through the documentation in the register. If there is indeed such a register, as the rumor mill insists is the case, though of course, its existence may be a wild fantasy. We know of such phenomena of fictional imagined registers, not least because Dobson himself wrote so forcefully of them in his pamphlet, wild and unhinged fantasies regarding the existence of wholly imaginary registers out of print, we can only guess how many index cards the pamphleteer used during the writing of this frankly blizzarding text, which marigold true for some reason typeset to make it look like a Pepsi popsy book for infants

following the writing of his letter to the press, identified Dobson is had second thoughts about the exhibition where he had been positive. He now heaped Execration is upon it, at first privately shouting at his reflection in a mirror. He seems to have been oddly reluctant to brew it his views abroad. This changed after he spent a prolonged stay in a sensory deprivation tank and emerged hopelessly bonkers. He was seen wandering around various post offices babbling at anybody who would listen. And then he was seen scampering like a mad thing in the hills, and then he was seen weeping and rending his garments at the graveside of fictional athlete Bob net to Vol. Then he vanished. He was missing during the dog days of the year, emerging as they petered out to publish his magnificent counter blast to bunco Tron, which I cited earlier. by quoting his words, I do not necessarily lend them my imprimatur. For one thing I did not see bancos show myself, so I cannot say whether he grasped the essence of the Dobson card index in all its lost glory. And for another thing, I rarely lend my imprimatur to anything. It can be rented at a cost, usually a cost involving blood and body parts and undying fealty, or one or two tangerines and seeds, and the plasticine head of a wolf on a stick.

Here's a simple magic trick to astonish your family and friends when performing it, where a sweeping black cape and apply some mascara around your eyes, doing so will add a dash of Mystique and make you seem a little more exotic than you already are. If you have no family and few friends, you can drag some mendicants and urchins and dogs off the street. I'm just going to take a sip of air at less water.

This trick can only be performed on a sunny day. For To begin, you need to position yourself in such a way that you're standing in a shaft of sunlight beaming through your window into an otherwise gloomy room. This shaft of light will make visible motes of dust dancing in the air around you. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a moat as a particle of dust, especially one of the innumerable minute specs seem floating in a beam of light. There are several other definitions of modes, but that's the one I'm talking about. Dust Meanwhile, is given as earth or other solid matter in a minute and fine state of subdivision so that the particles are small and light enough to be easily raised and carried in a cloud by the wind, any substance coming muted or pulverized powder. Again, the dictionary gives other meanings of dust, including that to which anything is reduced by disintegration or decay, specifically the ashes or molded remains of a dead body. Note that I'm not for one minute suggesting that you should perform this astounding magic trick while engulfed in a cloud of the dust. To which some close relative say your mom or your whan tuberculous sister has recently been reduced. If you're grieving for one not long departed, whether it be your mom or your sister or anybody else, you should probably not be trying to do conjuring tricks, even as a way of perking yourself up. Grief is grief and must run its course, as any number of books in the Self Help section of your local library will tell you even in this day and age. You may search fruitlessly in your library for a work of literature or history or science. But I'm told that the shelves still heave with self help books of all kinds, especially ones with the television time. Make sure you're standing within the shaft of sunlight erect and resolute. Do not hunched your shoulders or slouch and try not to topple over. If you're the sort of person who tends to topple because you're overwhelmed by the sheer weightiness of existence. Show yourself up with something metal poles, artfully placed can keep even the wealthiest of neurasthenic upright, at least for long enough to perform this trick. Explain to your audience that you're going to astound and amaze them. Speak in a booming voice resonant with melodrama. If you're incapable of producing sufficiently booming and melodramatic sounds, hire a ventriloquist who can be hidden somewhere within the gloom. Do not be disheartened if any members of your audience chuckle or titter, or even before that will be a reflection upon them, not upon you. They will I would wager big chuckling or tittering or guffawing due to nerves, nerves strain to snapping point in anticipation of the eldritch forces you are about to unloose meet any laughter with a cackle of your own, or of your ventriloquist, and make it a fiendish cackle, but don't overdo it. Now, it can happen, especially in a climate such as ours, that a sudden cloud will scatter across the sky and occlude the sunlight, thus rendering the motes of dust around you much less visible. If your room is sunk in particular gloom, the motes of dust may not be visible at all, and you yourself self may be better shadow in the murk and a blurred shadow that to those of your audience whose ocular faculties are pitiable. It's imperative that you keep their interest until the cloud passes, and the shaft of sunlight beams again, beams upon you once again, without a banjo or a ukulele and launch into an Appalachian folk song, preferably one with innumerable verses, but a less than compelling narrative, so that you can play and sing for as long as necessary, but break off as soon as the sunlight returns, even in the middle of a verse without disappointing your audience. Some people find it difficult to play stringed instruments while wearing sweeping black capes. I've never quite understood this, but apparently it's something to do with movement of the arms being hampered by the cape. If you were affected by this problem, try tucking the cape behind your back, or pick an Appalachian folk tune that requires only dissolve three strumming so that you need not move your arms too much.

It may be that the cloud blocking the sunlight is a harbinger of further clouds, even of a completely overcast sky, and assess her Rachel downpour will begin that would not be surprising in this land. Now, while such a turn of events may leave You crushed, and in no way is able to perform the astounding magic trick due to the lack of a shaft of sunlight beaming through your window. It has the advantage that your audience will almost certainly wish to remain indoors. True. Some of them may have come armed with Southwest as a macintoshes and galoshes and be willing to trudge back across the fields in the pelting rain. But the likelihood is that most will stay with you. For though you and I are in shrouded in gloom, it is at least dry gloom. I assume of course that you do not have gaping holes in your roof through which the rain comes in and forms puddles in the dense of your floor. If your repertoire of Appalachian folk songs is scanty, and you have exhausted it before the rainfall ceases, you will need to devise some other form of entertainment for your guests. This is where the ventriloquist, if you have hired one can be a godsend. Even if he or she has not brought their usual dummy with them. It's as simple enough matter the bundle of few rags together into a puppet. While the ventriloquist is keeping your audience spellbound, you can familiarize yourself with a few more Appalachian folk songs using speed learning techniques picked up from a self help book. Between the two of you, it ought to be Child's Play to keep your audience entertained for hours and hours, by which time even in this country, the sun would shine once more. On the other hand, if you have a booming and melodramatic voice, and you saw no need to hire a ventriloquist, things might get a bit ugly once your store of Appalachian folk songs has dried up. This is particularly the case if among your audience, you have persons with short tempers low boredom threshold, or those on day release from the nearby secure clinic for the criminally insane. In these circumstances, it will be well if you have borrowed from the library, a self help book such as how to pacify enraged audiences who were expecting a conjuring trick But we're fobbed off with Appalachian folk songs, followed by an eerie silence. But let us be optimistic and hope that that scouting cloud was no more than a fugitive visitor and that the sun shines brightly once more. cast aside your banjo will ukulele and make a couple of sweeping gestures with your cape. Ensure as you do so that nobody in the audience gets a glimpse of the Badger concealed within its black fold. Now, ask one of their number to step into the shaft of sunlight with you and to lend you their hat. On very, very rare occasions, not a single person in the audience will be a hat wearer, but this need not concern you. You will have taken the precautionary measure of planting a student with a stovepipe hat among your guests. Should nobody else volunteer, this person now leaps up with enthusiasm yet without betraying that the pair of you are old backers who go way way back. You take the stovepipe hat from him, and using sleight of hand, insert the Badger into it, it is absolutely crucial that no one sees you do this. You then place the hat on your students head and tell him to return to his seat or stall. At this point, do some flummery for a minute or two. Then with an air of distraction, as if it's an afterthought, ask your students to take his hat off. to the audience his amazement, he will do so to reveal a badger asleep upon his head. To resoundingly applause. Go and collect the Badger. Remember that you will need to pump it full of antidote fairly soon to rouse it from the coma induced by the serum with which you injected it earlier. You can then pass your own hat around upturned to collect any coinage which your stunned audience wishes to give you in gratitude for so thrilling a magic trick. A proportion of any monies collected should of course be spent on the treat for the backdrop.

Coincidentally, both of those pieces mentioned dogs in passing. Not a subject that I'm often reminded to address. But anyway, here is a story called the boring dog. Once upon a time, there was a man who had a dog and the dog bought him. Sorry, I've missed completely misread that sentence. I'm going to start again here is a story called the boring dog. Once upon a time, there was a man who had a dog and the dog bought him senseless. Even it's an earthly howling, with which it greeted the moon every night, and kept up until sunrise and which drove his neighbor's crackers bought him. When he took it for walks in the daylight and through sticks for it to effect. It failed to stir his interest. It drummed when chewing on dog biscuits, and as he mopped up the drawer from the rug demand side and complained about the unanswerable tedium of his dog. Nobody heard his complaints, for he lived alone with the dog, and the dog was death. Eventually the man went to say a dog advice person. I have come to see you because I'm bored by my dog. He said. Ah, said the dog advice person. Have you considered the possibility that you have a boring dog? The man admitted that this had not occurred to him. I've always felt that it was me who's at fault. He said. I've been consumed with fierce self loathing because I'm neither amused nor entertained by my dogs howling and stick factoring and dog biscuit drooling. The dog advice person examined the dog with a scope and a scanner and a probe and other instruments from his dog analysis kit. While this was going on, the man leafed through the magazines on the dog advice person's coffee table, none of which had any dog related content whatsoever. There were lots of articles about international shipping protocols and Antarctic weather stations and derelict railway lines, and the man became so mentally absorbed in them that the dog advice person has to shout at him repeatedly and kick his shins and slap him on the head to gain his attention when the examination was over. I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt and without fear or favor, that you have a boring dog. He said, packing away the instruments in his dog analysis kit and placing it carefully in a cupboard. Well, that's a weight off my mind, said the man. He took the dog home. On the way he threw sticks for it to fetch. Back indoors, he gave the dog a dog biscuit to chew on and mopped his drawl from the rug without complaint. And that nightfall, the dog began its unearthly howling. And the man went to bed and slept the sleep of the unweighted mind, he slept so deeply, that he did not wake up. When the neighbors gathered in the moonlight in a ring around his house, waving pitchforks bent on dog death.

I was trying to find something very short to read to end the show. But I couldn't find I'm still, in fact, looking for something short enough to read. And the more I do that, the less likely it is that there's going to be time enough to read something, which is typical, really of a show that's five years old, that every now and then things go a bit askew, that's because it's a live broadcast. So I'm just going to babble briefly, until it's sort of a decent time to finish in time for the next show, which is also live which means we need to do this very exciting handover in dead silence here in the studio. That can be quite thrilling, you know very well, you know, trying to maneuver in and out with various people and maintain absolute silence like this. That that was, and that was what is technically known as radio silence. You say I've picked a few things up. Since I started doing this show. I think I better stop now. It's a good job. It's not impromptu like this every week, and I'm usually reading rather than talking. I'm going to finish my beaker of aerated lettuce water. And I'll be back next week for the next five year plan, which will be Stalinist and rigorous and very sensible. So that's all for me for this week. Bye bye.
