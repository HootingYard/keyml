Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Whenever bumpkins gathered of an evening in the shack at the end of the line, sooner or later their talk will turn to the Huffington Post. It's not uncommon for the peasantry to fixate upon minutiae, of course, we think of old farmer Frak obsessed with his bellowing cows, or the Erie barn at screwin hunahpu or any number of pig related outbreaks of countryside mass hysteria, often focused upon something as insignificant as the shape of a newborn pig's snout or trotters. Yet the bumpkins preoccupation with the Huffington Post was curious, for To the untrained eye it looked like any other fence post or steak or piece of paling. I daresay you will I would pass by that post without giving it a glance, and the prattle of the bumpkins of an evening in the shack at the End of the Lane, with sounds to us nonsensical. But rustic wisdom is hard one, and Only a fool would dismiss the bumpkins shack chatter as dribbled. On a balmy evening, one such fool blundered into the shack at the End of the Lane. And hearing the bumpkins banding the profundities of Huffington Post law, took it for the idiocy of defectives with his briefcase and bowler hat. It was clear the fool dwelt in a city. Clear too, that he could not tell the Huffington Post from any other posts and steaks and pails thumped into the muck for fencing the fields. His manner and his smirks were disparaging of the bumpkins, and when he left the shack and was making his way to the railway station, they waylaid him and carried him off to the Erie barn at screwin hunahpu age and as they had done with others who came to Mach, they coated him in farmyard slurry and tar and poked him with pitchforks. And when they were done with him, they buried him at midnight, under the Huffington Post.

Dobson was an excessively tidy man. He firmly believed the old soul which insists there is a place for everything, and everything in its place. Thus, he kept sweets in jars and jars on shelves in cupboards. This despite his loading of confectionery. When asked why he stored so many sweets, including humbugs, tahfiz, and jammy teardrops in labeled jars on labeled shelves in labeled cupboards, Dobson blustered and tried to change the subject. Oh look, he might say, pointing out of the window, a mother Shrike with her Shrike lifts, or what would you say were the chief causes of the box arising. In the latter example, he would not bother pointing out of the window, but might Pharaoh his brow, as if he had been pondering the topic for some time. This sneaky yet transparent technique worked surprisingly often, few people other than marigold Chu felt confident enough in the pamphlet his presence to challenge Dobson. The explanation for this lies not in any personal magnetism or force of personality. In fact, for the life of me, I cannot think why he got away with his preposterous behavior. cutlery alignment in cutlery drawers was another type of tidiness which exercised the great man at particularly fraught times. He was known to align and to realign the cutlery in the cutlery drawer 10 times an hour. Sometimes, he would be halfway along the path to the pond to commune with swans, then turn on his heel and stamp back into the house to attend to the knives and forks. Nowadays, of course, some pop psychologist would make a television documentary asserting that Dobson suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder, but I think we can safely reject such a notion. It's not as if he was washing his hands every five minutes, or going do Lally at the sight of glitter. Indeed, he ought probably to have washed his hands more often. They were invariably ink splattered and grubby in other ways, particularly if he'd been down by the pond with the swans. No, I think we can rely on Dobson's own account of the cutlery issue, which he addressed in a pamphlet entitled, keeping cutlery aligned tidally in the cutlery drawer as an absolute imperative, if one aspires to be fully human, out of print, for reasons I not need not go into here, hardly anybody has ever bothered to read this middle period work. The prose is clogged and clunky, the views expressed idiotic and when typesetting it marigold qu. Chose so tiny a font that the average reader needs an extremely powerful magnifying glass to decipher the text. Oh, forgive me, I just went into the reasons why hardly anybody has ever bothered to read this middle period work. Dobson will describe that little slip of mind to the fact that the cutlery in my cutlery drawers is chaotic and askew? Am I not then fully human? And if not, what am I partly ape? Perhaps I would be able to answer those questions if I myself had read the pamphlet, but I confess I have not done so. My eyesight is not up to it. I could perhaps employ some bright eyed literate youngster to read it to me a perky little BrainBox uncowed by Latin tags and arcane references, and paragraphs that go on and on and on and on for 12 pages or more by clogged and clunky prose and idiotic views. But where would I find such a creature? I suppose I could take a stroll in the rain down to the nearest community hub. But that would be the act of a desperate man. Better by far Surely, either to accept my semi human status to give vent to my inner ape and to stuff my face with bananas and nuts, or conversely to go and align the cutlery and the cutlery drawer with Dobbs sonian precision and thus destroy the ape that lurks within me. It's a simple choice and one I shall not shirk from making

this is a story called bunkers Maisie Pevsner never passed this way so the building long abandoned remains on son hidden by Elm and you and larch and Sycamore only ghosts sing here now. Sing and dance, conjure and tumble, toot and whistle and crack the corniest of corny gags you ever did here for the crumbling palace of which I speak was once barges spinny Music Hall and variety theater. And it was here that one of the most singular careers in entertainment began and ended. Like a character from a gothic novel, bonkers. Maisie was locked up in an attic for 40 years. Whether her bonkers pneus was the motive for her confinement, or the inevitable result of it. We cannot say all others who lived at the stinking farmhouse, a top which the attic loomed are dead and gone, and they left no diaries or memoirs or confessions. Indeed, the only book to be recovered from the farm was the novel which was bonkers mazes companion for all those years. It was a copy of iron in the soul by john Paul Sartre. On the night of her rescue bunkers, Maisie came lolloping down the staircase, clutching the soft threat in one hand, and a moth eaten stuffed toy bear in the other. It was a one eyed bear and looked rather like the cloying mascot of the bbcs annual Children in Need appeal. It did not have a name actually passed through the door into the open air for the first time in 40 years. bonkers Maisie took one rapid, unblinking uncomprehending look at those who had kept her shut away. The soldiers had lined them up against the wall of the pigsty boy folded their necks already bed for the nooses. An owl hooted and bonkers Maisie was given an already lit a cigarette and driven away in a Jeep at reckless speed. One week later posters appeared in bodgers Spinney announcing an exciting new turn at the music hall and variety theater. Opening the show for more established act bonkers Maisie would take to the stage for half an hour. The advertisement ran shy of divulging the precise nature of her performance. So when the local hoi polloi peasantry shuffled resentfully into the sawdust strewn mosh pit, they had no inkling of what to expect. with everybody inside, the soldiers slam shut all the doors and set the timer locks. This was the era of the new look, and when bonkers Maisie skipped on stage, it was obvious that a benefactor had replaced her tattered attic rags. She tapped the microphone hesitantly with a gloved fingertip, and took from her new expensive wick fire handbag, her spookily pristine copy of iron in the soul, and beginning very quietly, but gradually getting louder until she was shrieking like a banshee. She read an octopus. He pulled out his knife and opened his eyes. rushes of blood to the head settle nothing. The abscess had got to be drained. He'll pretend to agree so as not to look like a prick bubble. But no sooner is your back turned than he evaporates into thin air. brew ne was grinding scraps of bread into the ground with his heel. The general mood welled sluggishly up in his mind and oozed from his mouth. Truth stood blocking every VISTA to those among the gathered peasants who were existentialists familiar with salt, it was apparent that bonkers Maisie was plucking phrases from the book at random. To the rest, the word took on a haunting granddaughter, some wept, all were transfixed. And then, after reading for 15 minutes, bonkers Maisie stopped, put the book back in her handbag sashayed to the side of the stage, and came back bearing in her Dior clad arms, a large bundle of dish cloths. She spent the next quarter of an hour in complete silence scrunching up the dish cloths one by one, and scrunching them and then scrunching them up again. It was not quite a magic show. In fact, it was as far from a magic show as one could get.

Yet by the time the emcee Tootle his whistle to signal that she sees her scrunching the crowd of rustics was bathed in an aura of absolute or that season bonkers. Maisie performed her show every night without a break, gradually moving up the billing until she was the star act for the final weekend. The morning after her last appearance, it is said that the soldiers came for her in their Jeep and drove her away from bulges Spinney before dawn. Some say they took her to the seaside, and that she lived out the rest of her days in tranquility. No one has ever been able to locate her gravestone. And one little note about that astute and or pernickety listeners may question a certain befuddlement in the chronology of the tale of bunkers Maisie, and of course, you're free to so to do. I offer no defense except to say that I may have muddled up my source material.

Once upon a time, there was a pig It was a sick pig. Now, in a town far away across the hills, there lived a vet. The vet had undergone many years of training in the veterinary sciences, and numerous diplomas in frames hung on the walls of his surgery for surgery was a clean, bright building in the middle of a row of slightly shabbier buildings in the center of the town far away across the hills from the sky with a sick pig ailed. Next to the surgery was a pie shop. And next to the pie shop was a haberdashery and next to the haberdashery was the town hall annex. On the other side of the vet's surgery from the pie shop, was a second pie shop. And next to that was the library. And squeezed in next to that was a kiosk selling tickets for local events and entertainment. And next to that was an ironmongery. Beyond the ironmongery was the bus station. The frames in which the vets many diplomas were displayed had been made by a framer on the other side of town. One day, the vet rolled up all his diplomas and shoved them into a cardboard cylinder and waited at the bus station. He caught the bus number 666 to the other side of town, and gave the cylinder to the person behind the counter the framers who filled in a receipt from a little pad of receipts and gave it to the vet who put it in his pocket. Six weeks later, the vet went to collect his many diplomas now beautifully framed, and he carried them back to his surgery on the 666 bus and hammered nails into the walls of his surgery, and hung the frames on the nails. Now he had all his diplomas on display. If the diplomas were to be believed, the vet had demonstrated the ability to cure the ills of horses and bats, and birds and toads and cats, and killer bees and shrews and weasels and ducks, and chickens and otters, and badgers and field mice, and cows and bears and hamsters, and even giraffes. But not one of his diplomas had a word to say about pigs. Now, the piggery person whose pig was sick upon discovering the pigs sickness, tried out a number of folk remedies, old and new. He sprinkled the pigsty with Tansy and frangipani and gloxinia he went to see the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman who gave him a spell to cast. He set up a loudspeaker in the pigsty and played in a gadda da vida by iron butterfly over and over again. He took tips from books by Tony Buzan, but the pig stayed sick. In fact, it got worse. The piggery person was at his wit's end. Then he remembered once hearing about the vet in a town far away across the hills. Leaving the assistant piggery person in charge, the piggery person set off on the long journey across the hills. On the first day, he met a man dressed all in green who set him a challenge. The piggery person bashed him about with a bludgeon and went on his way. On the second day, he was engulfed in a vaporous mist and had to use his torch to find his way out of it. On the third day, the man dressed all in green stood in his path again. So this time that piggery person felled him with a clever goon Fang maneuver. On the fourth day, from the very top of the high hills, he saw the town nestling in the verdant veil below, and a gigantic mythical bird, a bit like Sinbad rock but bigger, plucked him with its talents and swords down into the town and deposited him in front of the vets surgery.

The vet was out on call as an owl sanctuary. So while waiting for his return, the piggery person studied to the many diplomas hanging in their frames. on the walls. He was dismayed to note that not one of the diplomas announced the vet skills at curing sick pigs. He resolved not to fret but to question closely the vet upon the vets returned to his surgery. He sat down in the waiting room and lift through some of the Dobson pamphlets, scattered Higgledy Piggledy on the table. He became so engrossed in a pamphlet entitled, The Man Who put the bee in Beelzebub that he did not notice the vet skipping jauntily back into the surgery, even though his entrance set a bell a jangling when the piggery person looked up from the pamphlet, the vet was looming over him. It was the man dressed all in green he had twice encountered on his journey. Twice we met and twice you knocked me aside. Now here you are, where I abide rhymed the vet in a voice high pitched, wheedling and malevolent, the piggery person shriveled in his seat. Your pig is sick, and I shall cure it, but you will have to pay a forfeit, said the vet. He pointed his long bony finger the piggery person and sparks flashed and there was a puff of inexplicable Rosi eight vapor when it dispersed the seat where the piggery person had been sat shriveling, was revealed to be empty. At the same moment, far away across the hills at the piggery, the Assistant piggery person was bit flummoxed to see the sick, pig cured, cured and thriving. It grunted happily, and cross it out to scrub oil in the muck. There was a big black beetle in the muck.

This is called a boot bath. He washed his boots in the bath with a scrubbing brush. That is what he did when he got mud on his boots. He took off his boots and placed them on a mat and he filled the bath with boiling water. Then he plunged his boots into the bath. He put on a pair of gloves before he plunged his boots so the flesh on his hands would not burn. When the boots were in the bath, he sprinkled soap flakes from a box on the surface of the boiling water. Then he went to fetch the scrubbing brush. The scrubbing brush was nowhere near the bath. He had to go up and down stairs to get it from its hook. There was a hole drilled in the handle of the scrubbing brush so it could be held by the hook. The hook was fixed to the wall. It was a fixture and fitting. The scrubbing brush was not. It wasn't a pertinence He neither knew nor cared which was a fixture and fitting and which was an appurtenance. His only concern was to get the mother of his boots. He scrubbed his boots with the scrubbing brush while the boots were submerged in the bath of water, to which he had added soap flakes from a box. The mud came off his boots in chunks. When the last flecks of mud had been scrubbed off his boots he took the boots out of the bath and place them back on the mat. The mat was made of rubber. He pulled the plug out of the plug hole in the bottom of the bath and the bath water drained away. While the water drains he took the scrubbing brush up and downstairs and put it back on it hook. He took off his gloves and threw them down a chute. At the bottom of the chute was a pile of other gloves and such things as shirts and socks and tunics. Once a week the pile was swept into a hamper and taken off to be washed but not today. He went up and downstairs to the room with a bath in it and looked at his boots on the mat until they were dry. Then he puts on his boots. Just in time he heard the tutor whistle. He sprinted up and down stairs and past the place where the scrubbing brush hung on it took and carried on out of the door and through the garden gate and he sprinted round and round the running track until a whistle tooted again he stopped and panted and looked expectedly at the whistle tooting person. The whistle tooting person was studying his stopwatch. Oh how he hoped that this time he had sprinted round and round the running track faster than the last time he had sprinted round and round the running track. Then he had had mud on his boots but now he had washed them in the boiling hot bath with a scrubbing brush. Soap flakes from a box and there was no longer any mud on his boots. A nod from the whistle tooting person told him he had sprinted round and round the running track faster than before. He was oh so happy.
