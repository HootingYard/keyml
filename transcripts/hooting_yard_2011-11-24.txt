And the vast expanse of the wooden Lake out past the Spinney has been willfully ignored by the writers of gazzard tears of the hinterland of the spinny why should that be, it's as if they want it kept a secret, the vast wouldn't like stretching as far as the eye can see. With Heron there along it shows clumps of Aspen and large and plain trees, clumps of Lupin and Holly Hawkins Burj. I like to create it in one such clump armed with my binoculars and a bird scarifier my socks are damp. The wooden like is not like entirely of wood of course, only its surface is of wood plank after plank after plank of planed and varnish torn beam slotted together by master carpenters to form of vast flat expanse covering every inch of the lake which broods below you need not ice nor skates to cross the lake, you can simply walk across it. So early in the morning when drew drops have fallen. It can be slippery, so smoothly planed and varnished are the planks. I stamped across the lake to reach the clump by hiding. I stamped in my big black boots. When you read the Gaza tears or look at maps loosely for in atlases, you will find Not a trace of the wooden like sometimes its location is simply ignored. Sometimes there is a pretense that it is the site of wild woods, or a donkey sanctuary or an industrial estate riddled with canneries. But here is only wood, not metal. Unless one takes into account the nails used to strengthen the slotting together a plank hewn from thousands upon thousands of hornbeams along with my binoculars and bird scarifier I have a hammer stone in my clump, but no nails. In the village on the other side of the spinny the village nearest to the wooden like you will never hear a word spoken in the pub or the post office or the Smithies Forge, about the vast expanse of wood stretching as far as the eye can see on the other side of the spinny. Just as in the Gasser tears You can buy in the village shop, there is a conspiracy of silence. I am persona non grata in the village under the surface of the wooden like the waters churn and boil somewhere in the vastness of the deep sea, there is a creature fear some flippered and gigantic, a blasphemous fallow pod, such as no one can look upon without being frozen and blinded and driven insane. At least that is my theory, a theory which over the years has grown into a conviction calcified into mono mania. I know I am right. That is why the lake is covered by a vast expanse of wood. That is why I was physically ejected from the village with kicks and curses. That is why I'm hidden in a clump with my binoculars, and my bird scarifier and my hammer. I am not so foolish as to think that I can scare the monster with the scare of fire as it might scare us darling or a sparrow or a puppet. But I have no proof that it will not be let us say slightly disconcerted long enough at least for me to hear Across the plank edge to the spot where it has burst forth, and a battery on his giant head with my hammer.

And when I have bashes unconscious, I should pull it from the lake and patch up the hole It is made in the woods. And I shall drag the monster all the way across the vast expanse of the wooden like towards the spinny and through the spinny to the village, and I shall shove it into the village duck pond on the village green and sit upon the grass and wait for it to wake. And its name shall be diago bird.

mention of a bird scarifier in that last piece reminds me to bring to your attention. Something I read in the dabbler, some of you might know the dabbler the website where I do a weekly column. But there's much else of interest to read in the dabbler. And the other day, I think it was in on Sunday. In fact, there's often a music post from Marla man and others, but Marla man who tells us about various pieces of music, usually with the links. And one of the pieces that he told us about last Sunday was the Gothic Symphony. By having a gal Brian. Hanging out Brian lived the late 19th century until the late 20th century, he was he lived to the age of about 93 or 94. I can't quite remember which and wrote lots and lots and lots of symphonies, I think something like 32 symphonies, most of the bulk of which were written after he was 80. And he wrote some of them after he was 90, but the first one from back in I think the the 20s, or possibly earlier with the Gothic Symphony, and as Marla man told us in the dabbler, the score calls for up to 1000 performers, including nine choirs for offstage brass bands, and the normal orchestra size doubled up to about 150 players. A vast percussion section includes chains, a thunder machine, and a bird scare. That Brian was one of the great British eccentrics has never been in doubt.

I've actually listened to the Gothic Symphony, it goes on for nearly two hours. Remarkable stuff, and you get to hear all sorts of banging and crashing. So I'd look that out if I were you. Mute further music news now. I've just been reading the pendulum years Britain in the 60s by Bernard Levin, somehow almost a forgotten figure nowadays, even though he bestrode the media, almost like Stephen Fry, in his heyday. And the remarkable thing about the pendulum years is that it was published in 1970. So the 60s have only just ended. And it's and yet it's a remarkably clear sighted view of the decade, and most of Bernard Levin's observations and conclusions would hold good even with the benefit of 40 years hindsight. However, however, pop music, which was written pop hyphen, music by Bernard Levin wasn't exactly his strong point. Though, he makes a tremendous effort to address the phenomenon. And here is a passage from 1970. From the pendulum years, Britain in the 60s by Bernard Levin. The growth of pop music groups, many no doubt inspired by the gigantic commercial success of The Beatles to believe that the lightning might strike them to if they only formed fours and began to perform. But many also clearly in the business of self expression, was the most extraordinary phenomenon in the world of entertainment of the whole decade. Long before its end, there were literally thousands of them in Britain. And America, and though many flourished only briefly, many displayed surprising insurance. And in any case, that were always tend to take the place of one which fell somewhere almost as famous and successful as the Beatles, someone known only to the most devoted aficionados, but all added to the atmosphere of the decade, and the aisle was full of noises as never before coming from, among others, the Rolling Stones, the big trees, the monkeys, the doors, the cream, the Mothers of Invention, the seekers, the who the small faces, the pretty things, the animals, the Pink Floyd, the scaffold, the Grateful Dead, the tremeloes, the family, the Supremes, the holding company, the Four Tops, the Led Zeppelin, the shadows, the exploding galaxy, the editors, the thugs, the gods, the kinks, the hermit, the paper dolls, the breakaways, the grease band, The casuals, the amen corner, the big sound, the flirtations, the heard, the marbles, the status quo, the New York Public Library, the Hollies, the foundation's, the electric havens, the Four Seasons, the bachelor's, the SE shells, the love affair, the fifth dimension, the Three Dog Night, the equals the vagal, the vagabonds, the marmalade, the mind benders, the Moody Blues, the muret, the Tuesday's children, the plastic Penny, the protocol horam.

Let me reassure listeners that that's a direct quote from Bernard Levin. I didn't add or subtract anything from it. He was actually known for liking to write very long sentences. But that one's particularly good, I think, and have depressed a beef he realized that whereas the bulk of those we've we've spell heard of. I haven't heard of all of those bands, I must admit, and I am quite keen to know about the Ohara Express, for some reason. Anyway, last week, some of you will have been there. Not many of you, but some of you will have been at the evening of lagu breus music and lopsided prose, which went very well. And but it occurred to me that I thought it was prudent when making preparations for the evening to provide the audience with a list of instructions to ensure that they conducted themselves properly. After all, you don't want to have to interrupt your babbling to have to deal with bits of the vapors, noisy potato, crisp munching or other distractions and so the printed program for the evening included a list of instructions for members of the audience. And it occurred to me that it might also be useful for not only for other performance, but maybe slightly adapted for those of you listening in the privacy of your own home, so the radio show. So, here are the instructions which we can maybe tinker with them slightly, but this is what you should be doing or not doing when listening. Please remain seated during the more exciting moments. If for any reason you need to mop your brow use a dainty napkin. spillages must be paid for in coinage of the realm. When the darning needle of destiny is unveiled, cower. unseemly pangs may be tempered by moral balance. Applause should be rendered with unbridled fanaticism. Drink everyone the waters of his own system until I come and take you away. Isaiah 36 verses 16 and 17.

The first man ashore was Captain Myles Coverdale, a man all too aware that he shared his name with the first translator of the Bible into English. The second manager was corporal William Tyndale, who had absolutely no idea that he shared his name with the first man to translate the Bible into English from the original Greek and Hebrew. The third man ashore was kornet James Version known to all and sundry as King James Version. As dawn broke, the captain, the corporal and the Cornett stood panting and Brian drenched on the glittering sands. They took their firearms from the rubber sacks in which they had carried the mature and cocked them yonder in the trees and bushes, savages could be lurking. This was an uncharted land. The first day had spotted from the periscope of their submarine in all their months at sea, months that would turn to years for the submarine was on a five year mission to explore strange new world to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no submarine manned by a captain and the corporal Anna Cornett had gone before. There was a sudden rustling in the trees and bushes beyond the shoreline sands. Instinctively, Captain Myles Coverdale aimed his ray gun and fired. It was his way to shoot at the first sign of movement and worry about the consequences later. That was why he was the captain. As the foliage burst into flames. He pranced forward, taking further blasts, signaling for the corporal and the Cornett to follow him. Above in the sky, birds shrieked. Just before they reach the burning trees and bushes, a thicker stepped out to confront them, a finger unlike any they had seen before. It was in derivatively a man but what manners man, his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of apparently whiteness. But these luxuriance is only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost the same color as the Dan white socket in which they were set is shriveled to come. connection and his striped black lips. The captain was in no doubt. What out mean? He cried. That is one of the savages I warned you about. Shall we kill it immediately in cold blood captain? asked the corporal. Wait. I think it is about a grunt some unholy savage babbling, said the cornered and indeed, the strange finger held up a hand as if in greeting and shook chard leaves and twigs from its hair, and its watery eyes fixed the trio of submariners in a mesmeric gaze. Its voice when it last spoke was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. bbti onos quisque quiet Aqua and sister nice su I don't have any m et tala M. Voss. It said. Crikey. What was that all about? us the corporal if I am not mistaken, said the captain is speaking Latin. It said something along the lines of drinky everyone the waters have his own system until I come and take you away. actually said Cornett King James Version. Now you mention it. I'm quite thirsty. Permission to glug from my system captain. Captain miles Coverdale assess the situation in a twinkling as he had been trained to do back at captaincy training school. While keeping a Beady Eye on the Savage. He commanded his men to take the systems from their sexuals and then go out go why. Made the glog the Cornett had a sudden thought and piped up. Captain, he said, the savage said that when we drunk eat from his own system, he was going to take us away. Where do you think he's gonna take us to. But even as he spoke, the salvage came lumbering forward, and it swept the three of them up, and it carried them off into the trees and the bushes. They were swept away. They were swept away and gone.

Birds continued to shriek in the sky, and the glittering sands were again deserted as before. And just offshore, the submarine like bobbing on the water, and waves crashed over it. And As the years passed it rusted and broke into pieces. And one by one that pieces sank to the bottom of the sea and became looks for crabs and lobsters, and other beings have the deep or No trace was ever found of the captain, and the corporal and the Cornett.

So if you've been paying attention, you'll note that there was a quotation from the book of Isaiah. In that piece. There was also a quotation from a fiery flying roll by Ibiza cop, sort of, and most significantly, of course, the savage the description of the savage was taken word for word from the description of Frankenstein's monster in Frankenstein, or a modern promethease by Mary Shelley. Both the appearance and the voice of the savage were taken directly from Mary Shelley. So there you go. Speaking of female writers of the 19th century I've been reading a book called Emily Dickinson profile of the poet has cook with selected recipes. And it's by God that the Dickinson homestead, Nancy Harris Bros. Giuliana McGovern do pre Wendy tota cola and the resident curator, dreamer claw Matt Mudge, Jean McCormack published in 1976. So, I'd somehow if creed McCall Madras still the resident curator, anyway, in among always stuff, there's a passage which said Emily's correspondent and critic Thomas Wentworth Higginson reported in 1870 that the poet's told him, people must have puddings, this very timidly and suggestively as if they were meat eaters or comments. I wonder if it will be possible, given sufficient intellectual rigor, and pen and paper, and time, and a good library and copious amounts of tea to write a study of the poetry of Emily Dickinson demonstrating without fear of contradiction that the key to her work, the one overriding fact that more than any other gives us an insight into her singular genius, and allows us for the first time to see her whole, free of ambiguities and uncertainties, free to have the enigmatic pattern of that has accreted around her like an enshrouding nest, so that we can at last take her proper measure is the assertion by her Campion Thomas Wentworth Higginson that she was able to connect in her own mind, albeit timidly and suggestively, but nonetheless, inextricably. For once we heard it, we ourselves cannot do the untangling, and that's the iron link or train is now in our own head, transmitted across the years from the brain of the bell of amhurst, comets, and meteors and puddings.
