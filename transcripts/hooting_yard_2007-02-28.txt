This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I was about to say it's half an hour of prose. But I'd like to begin this week, in fact with some verse. This was written as a piece of prose, but one of my readers of the shooting yard website pointed out to me that it rhymes, so I thought I'd recite it as if it were a poem. And it's called the heroic bus driver of pointy town. There was a heroic bus driver, and his name was Kim a fat glue. He drove his bus through puddles. He drove it straight and true, though he swerved if he saw a duck or a pig or an infant, human, tiny, or a succubus, or an Incubus, as he steered toward the briny, he drove his bus across pointy town heading for the sea. At the beach, he stopped to let passengers off and he drank a flask of tea. Oh Kim, a fat goo. He drained his flask and he tipped the dregs in the sand, and the idle the while on the promenade, and he watched a spaceship land output a gaggle of alien beings with flippers and antenna and claws and flagrant disregard for the rubric of pointy town laws. We are an invasion force from the planet of contaminated wheat. We are starveling spacemen and we need something to eat. I will drive you to the pie shop said fearless Kim fat guru, get on the bus and sit quietly till we reach the pie shop queue. But he drove his bus up into the hills to a hermit abandoned hut and he lured the invading spacemen in and sealed the doorway shot. So Kim fat goo the bus driver was the savior of pointy town, and that is why his name rings out within perishable renown.

Back to pros now and this is a story called The ebbing away of the age of gilded tin baths. There is no one left alive who witness to the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin baths, nor do we have any written records of that time. The pitiful smidgen of information we do have has come down to us in the form of in comprehensible pictograms and a pair of 78 RPM shellac discs and these are locked away in a concrete box. Far far underground beneath the Museum at or near ACC. The bunker is only accessible through a heavily padlocked Orrin Hatch, one of very few such hatches ever manufactured based upon a patented hatch design, which despite what you may read in the sorts of magazines, beloved of the conspiracy, fixated has absolutely no connection with a US Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican, Utah. Those of you with even a smattering of knowledge about hatches and bunkers will understand how hard it is to get anywhere near those pictograms. Those 78 when last one of our investigators examined the hatch, she reported back that it showed no signs of having been opened since notorious botsman incident 1956 the reckless idiocy of blots man's intervention has been thoroughly detected in pebble heads best selling paperback, a man and his shovels so I need not rehearse it here. Our investigator codename hortense reported something else. She said that the metal ladder which forms the final stage of the approach to the bunker was rife with scratches and dents and had buckled in a few places. This is new. The latter has until now been kept in pristine condition by the maintenance team at or near ACC, whose rigorous training is well attested or tense was unable to posit a convincing explanation for the latter damage. And for the time being the file has been put aside. When I say put aside, I mean literally literally that placed on the right hand side of my desk next to the pot with the bond side plugged in and the framed photograph of Bing Crosby embracing a howler monkey. Had I classed it as an active file, it would be in the wire tray on the left hand side alongside my important stationary buzzer message funnel and metal Tapping Machine. The area of the desk immediately in front of me is kept bare so I can think clearly. I know this sounds as if I have fallen victim to the fad for Feng Shui, but that's not the case. In fact, I'm minded to say that Mr. Crosby's howler monkey would benefit more from feng shui than I would. Incidentally, you may have been told by some earnest nitwit that the correct pronunciation of feng shui is Fung Shui way not so. It's actually Fung show, or possibly thing scheu. Anyway, what I was thinking clearly about at the moment was not hortensis report on the damaged metal ladder, but a more urgent matter. That very morning the post he had brought me a package containing a miniature shellacked disc wrapped in grease proof paper. There was also a letter, obviously written by a mad person, claiming that the disc was a copy of one of the two discs locked in the bunker, and therefore I listened to it with care. I would learn many many interesting things about the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin bars. Now you must understand that in all my years of service to the commission, I have never heard even a whisper that such a copy existed. My first impulse was to smash the shellack into smithereens for I have a short fuse and I'm not to be dallied with bipole croons. Why is a council was provided by hortensia, who offered to listen to the tiny 78 on her Mickey phone and to appraise its content with her unorthodox, unorthodox yet piercing intellect. I gave her the Go ahead, and as I often do, sat contemplating the blue eyes of Bing Crosby and the black eyes of the howler monkey pondering on the ineffable mysteries of existence.

I was snapped out of my reverie when hortensia came dashing breathlessly into my sanctum, her face twisted into a Rictus of lovecraftian terror. Throughout my life, I have been plagued by nosebleeds and the one that began to flow the instant or tense crashed in was the big potato, as they say. I was far too busy flapping around trying to find a cloth to staunch the gore pouring out of my nose to listen to my investigators gibbering by the time I had recovered myself, hortensis swooned. And in so doing, she banged her head, causing as we later discovered complete memory loss. She never did remember what she heard on that shellacked disk, or nor was she able to recall it which railway station she had rented a luggage locker in which to put the disk for safekeeping. I've remonstrated with her, of course, but with a faint heart for despite my ferocious temper, I'm a complete softie in the presence of amnesiacs. So now I sit at my desk looking into the eyes of the crooner, and the Howler and hortensia reclines on a sofa somewhere far away having her brain massaged by nuns. The truth is, she was the only investigator I had all the others having been taken away from me by the glittering fat heads upstairs. And now hortensia is gone, and hortensis memory is gone. And I wonder if the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin bars is also gone. irretrievably vanishing into the past, it's splendors never to be rekindled in the minds of men and women in this baffling age of pap.

If you've ever spent a weekend with an owl God, you will know that it can be a character building experience. I have vivid memories of the time and couch you technological. The Night Owl god of the Aztecs made itself at home in my flat for three prying days. I live in a glitzy and gleaming block of futuristic design impossibly Stark with lots of exciting remote control hubs. But the fact is it's small, even pokey, and it doesn't help that I have crammed into it the contents of my Mars laboratory and my powers garden shed. Together with much of the furniture thrown out when the local vet refurbished his waiting room, and a jumble of junk from a hellhole. That Friday evening, I was crumbled on a city eating lemon meringue pie and reading pebble heads best selling paperback brute beauty and valor and act Oh air pride plume here buckle. When the front door center vibrated. The Hub hummed and the plasma display flashed insistently. I had a visitor though no one was expected. thinking it might be a goon coming to serve me with an asbo I depress the locking knob on the entry pod, put down my pie plate, and tiptoed my way through some of Mars Olympics to the door. peering through the Tintin slat I saw a hunched and somewhat shabby figure dressed like a bus conductor, if you can remember bus conductors, he I thought it was a he was not holding anything that might be an asbo. So being an affable SOT I opened the door. He or rather it almost knocked me over, as it somehow soared past me and came to rest next to the city. Before either of us spoke it, plucked my plate off the floor and scoffed what was left of the lemon meringue pie. Then it said, Good evening. I am an Aztec God. My name is chouchou TECHO lotrel. And I am an hour god of the night. You look like a bus conductor, I replied, and a shabby one at that. Then it screeched at me. It was the loudest and longest screech I have ever had the misfortune to hear. My ears did not stop ringing until Sunday lunchtime, by which time the hour God had completely taken over my life within the confines of my fab, but tiny flat, it swooped it packed at things, it shifted shape. It did some strange rewiring manipulations to my stereo system. It flattered and it preened it fixed me for hours with a cold in human stare at sprouted tufts and feathers. It would not let me read my pebble head paper back. It hooked up gobbets of semi digested pie. It smashed all Mars lab equipment to smithereens. Then ate the smithereens. It shifted shape again. It's summon some of its as tech God pals and held a rally Saturday night party. It kept me awake by looming menacingly just out of sight. It filled the bath with wounded mice and stoats and weasels. It made me sit through a four hour documentary about Spandau Ballet Its metabolism speeded up to the point where everything in the flat was shaking. It found out my friends and told them I'd moved to dawlish. It somehow managed to drag a live Swan into the bathroom and savaged it with its talents. It screeched and squeaked, drowning out the shipping forecast. It burned its bright incandescent fury into my soul. And on Monday morning, it shape shifted again, just as it was pulverizing my bread bin and turned back into what looked like a shabby bus conductor. I'm leaving you now, it said, and it sounded almost regretful. I watched it leave and slumped on what was left of the city. I took a nap and then I went to see the priest to explain to him that I was renouncing the Roman Catholic faith forever. He tried to lure me into the confessional box, but I threatened to tear his beating heart out of his chest and make an offering of it to that mighty orb. The sun that shut him up. I sashayed off through the glittering streets past Pang Hill often Adrian across sawdust bridge towards glory.

You're not you can't say a word about religion these days without being told you're being offensive. After that last piece a weekend with an owl God appeared on the hooting yard website. www dot hooting yard.org for those of you who don't know, anyway, after that piece appeared on the website, I got an email from someone called Steven Adams while Pat green have a an organization called as tech voice. And he this is what he said. Dear Mr. Key, I'm writing to protest in the strongest possible terms about your slanderous treatment of the Aztec faith, producing the name of our night our God chouchou TECHO lottle in such disgusting terms is not funny. It is deeply offensive to our most cherished beliefs. Like any other religion, the Aztec faith demand respect in 21st century Britain, which means among other things, respecting our cultural right to practice a bloody form of human sacrifice on big stone altars, as well as feeling wounded and offended. Your attack has also made us angry, and you know what happens when the gods get angry? Please send me your postal address and telephone number so I can publish them on our website and provoke other as tech believers to exact the retribution, which is your Jew fight. Well, I did a bit of research into this Mr. At acquired by green, and apparently he sent his children to an Aztec faith school. And he successfully applied for government funding to set up something called the Aztec Human Rights Commission.

I read in The Guardian a few days ago on the 23rd of February, actually, whatever day that was five days ago. I read in The Guardian, a quote from Hazel Blears, the chairwoman of the Labour Party, and she said, the days of pulling the central lever are behind us. Readers averse readers listeners listeners of a certain age will remember the leavers there was a row of them color coded black and pink and orange and Cerise and yellow and golden and Dan and red and lavender and green and move and coffee and blue and wheat and white. They had to be pulled in a precise order of course, which changed from hour to hour. It was not well paid work being a lever pulling person, but it was dignified and responsible and important work and those To pull the levers were accorded to respect. And none gained as much respect as the pull of the central lever, the only one which changed color, or rather, was wrapped in burlap shades of different colors, hour by hour, and sometimes minute by minute, by dint of a scheme so abstruse so utterly bewildering, that those responsible for it, like rarely lasted more than a couple of months in the job before they had to be retired off to a seaside resort. pebble heads best selling paperback, they selected the burlap trees for the central lever. True Stories of heroic color coding is a useful if failed attempt to demystify the whole shenanigans in words of one syllable. it's sometimes hard to comprehend just how important the leavers were, nowadays were able to live happy and fulfilling lives without them, without the relentless pulling of them. or so it seems. I have my doubts. It's not mere nostalgia that makes me hanker for the days when the pulling of the leavers and particularly the pulling of the central lever was uppermost in people's minds, drawing us together, binding us, giving us a sense of common purpose. Blodgett always remembered his time as the puller of the central lever as the happiest period of his life. His enemies said, still say that he only did the job for the free toffee apples are normally one would agree. I have had stern words to say about blood jetty and gluttony myself. But for once I think his motives were pure. After an apprenticeship on the golden and pink leavers, he stepped up to the central lever pulling position on St. Gertrude day in 1952. And then who saw it will ever forget the beam of fantastic Glee on his pockmarked and greasy face as he stood there on his plinth, as the duty cadet swapped the blue for a slightly different shade of blue dyed burlap sheath on the central lever. The flock of crane nightingales on the railings burst into joyous song, fiery stars flamed in the sky. Blodgett waited for the pop of a Cornett, which would be his signal to pull the central lever for the first time. Just thinking about it makes me want to weep. So please forgive my snuffling says, I forgive those who snuffle before me.

Who would have thought that Blodgett would be the last person ever to pull the central lever. He did so for many, many years, of course, with gusto and vim, so the applause of those who were very occasionally allowed past the railings to watch. But came the day that the pulling of the leavers, the black and pink and orange and Cerise and yellow and golden and done and red and lavender and green and mowed and coffee, and blue and wheat and white ones, as well as the central lever became somehow irrelevant to our town mocked, even seen as an antiquated and idiotic ritual. And Blodgett and the others were paid off with a crate of toffee apples, and given free cabins in the hills, and the leavers rusted, the burlap trees were left to rot. The nightingale trainer was taken to a quarry and shot by the new regime. And one day, gigantic bellowing engines came and flattened the square where the leavers and the railings had stood for 100 years. And it was all gone. After cameras cannot guess the beauty been, and evaporated milk factory was built on the spot in decently fast, and I watch children cycle round and round it, and I shout at them, and I wave my bludgeon and they cycle round and round and round.

Here's a biographical note about old hollub before winning fame or perhaps notoriety is a better word. As the coach of fictional athletes Bob net to Vol. The train smoking misery guts we know and love as all kalob that a purposeless and indigent existence the familiar image of him in that raincoat, grim and windswept and coughing up Qatar, standing at the side of a running tracks burring his fictional protege onto ever greater sprinting crimes had not yet been been through television screens across the globe. Back in the days when only a cluster of hovels stood on the site that would one day become the old hallowed stadium of sporting triumphant prowess. In his best selling paperback, old Hallo band, Petula Clark, are they the same person? pebble head posits the theory that the possibly East European coach and the English songstress are the same person. He points to the well documented fact that both as children sang in the entrance hall of Bendel's department store in Kingston upon Thames, in exchange for a ton of toffee and a gold wristwatch. In addition, like Petula Clark, old hollub released a CD entitled The songs yell vant success, new Billy ARB. This is where his argument fails to convince for where the aged pop divas album contains songs and was a chart hit in Belgium. Old halabi cd consisted of a recording of him eating his breakfast and grumbling about his mouth eaten raincoat and was an international rather than merely a local success. pebble heads twaddle is thoroughly demolished Of course, if we consider that for the first 52 years of his life, old How long did little except refill birdfeeders in the grounds of a home for the deranged a drug for which he was paid with a daily bowl of gruel and slops. His parents were fabulously wealthy, and live the life of Riley in a big forbidding castle. But their son lacked ambition, and they disowned him when, at the age of nine, he rejected their birthday gift of a booster backpack, the elixir of life a modeling contract with L'Oreal and a populated planet in a far distant galaxy to treat as his placing. No one not even pebble head knows what happened to transform the doll with a bird feeder maintenance man into an athletics coach of legend. Perhaps a clue lies in his change of diet. Shortly after old Howard's 50th birthday, the management of the derangement home was restructured following a report from consultants price Watergate Cooper's Freeman hardy Willis, as part of their recommendation, I'll have stopped eating growling slops, and it was instead fed on whelks and barnacles. The evidence is not conclusive, but future biographers would be stupid to ignore it. And that's all I have to say about today.

A couple of couple of quotations from other writers. In fact, well that was from another writer because I didn't write that recipe. And this is from the song of the cakes by Nat Schachner and Arthur l zag at some of the cakes. As he stood there musing, the door burst open the mid a great clamor and shouting and a mob of drunken soldiers poured through the gap. They were staggering under silken robes, golden goblets, helmeted their heads. Precious ornaments of Jade dangled from their persons, the foremost of the writers beheld of the ancient Ming priest, with joyous cries, they pounced upon him, seized him with and gentle hands. Oh, outlived reptile of a curse lineage, give us your hidden treasures, or we slit your wisdom throat. The priest struggled feebly in his capitalise grasp, crying feebly. And that was from the song of the cakes by Nat Schachner and Arthur elders I get, I said, there'd be two quotes, but there's just one because that's the end of the show. Bye bye.
