Hello, this is Rosenlund swallow 4.4 fm. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. This is a story from the last century. It's called the big metal fence. freakishly tall, draped in a soutien my brain pounding. I found myself standing before a trench full of sludge. in each hand, I discovered I was holding a bucket of pungent glue. My feet were encased in sturdy plastic booties and at least two pairs of socks. I squelched across the trench, each step expelling from the sludge, noise, some fumes that wafted in the air behind me, shimmering and stinking. After some minutes, I clambered onto the other side and rested the buckets upon the ground. sulfurous fires a blaze within my skull, I had made the crossing from life into death. Eternity was before me. That was six weeks ago, and I have now prepared this preliminary report of my impressions. I do not doubt that as further ions pass, what follows may appear naive, churlish and inaccurate. I shall file a more detailed report in 10 billion years or so, and it will be instructive for scholars to compare the two documents are repeat. These are very much first impressions. In marshaling my material, I plunged the majority of my notes into the shoot of wrack and ruin, which is on the mezzanine floor of the larger of the two damn buildings. First, because to include everything would make this report too long and unwieldy. Second, because I've come to enjoy the worrying and clanking noises emitted by the shoot when it is put into operation. It is my fondest hope that however limited and fragmentary the material, my listeners will nonetheless gain a useful insight into what awaits them after death. So far, I have discovered four pubs, the butcher's vest, the consumptive Stalinist, the 10th, chaffinch and the smoldering more. To get into the latter you must be in possession of a special ticket issued by the river police, whose headquarters are in a small heart at the bottom of a flight of stone steps, a few hundred yards north of the moribund dam. To get into the hot tower there. You need a license from the buffed up shield Committee, which meets only once every 4000 years. It's typical of my luck that it met just two days before I arrived here. From what I've heard, the smoldering more has the very best drinks in the afterlife. And what's more there free. My friend ring truck who has been here for untold centuries, recommend a peculiar brew they serve called the hoist. It is effervescent, curdled, of a startling lavender tinge. And after four pints you get to draw in Captain snaps committee of which more later I have been able to get into the other three pubs mentioned, none of which has any restrictions on entry. The Butcher's vest is the only one worthy of repeated visits. Its landlord, a battered Titan whose name is unpronounceable comes from the same village as me. Although he lived there many centuries before I was born. We have had many little chats, although his speech is hard for me to follow. As he's toothless and slobbers uncontrollably. The range of drinks is somewhat limited, but the landlord provides enticing snacks for his regular customers. Each of the tables has a bowl of boiling hot custard on it into which one can get a staggering selection of biscuits, crackers, bands, tarts, and pastries. Often these are stale, but when moistened with sufficient custard, they're quite palatable. The tables are rickety, though, so one must be careful to avoid spillages which enraged the landlord to the point where his hair stands on end, his face turns purple and he gets his cronies to homophobia. Fender into an open sewer which runs past the back door.

You may find it difficult to believe, but absolutely everyone here is dressed from head to foot in corduroy. When I made the crossing, you will recall I was wearing a suit stain. I have no idea why. at reception, however, I was ushered into a little cubicle and given a set of corduroy apparel, to change into hat shirt gerkin underpants, pantaloons, socks and moccasins. The suit was taken away and I have not seen it since. Later, when I was taken to my quarters, I discovered a wardrobe full of corduroy clothing. Yes, my quarters. What is accommodation like on the other side of the grave? Well, pokey, the population is of course ever increasing. So overcrowding is a seemingly insoluble problem. Contrary to popular belief, as far as I can remember, we do not have unlimited space. Those who have been here for an unimaginably long time, can only dimly remember when they had a small room all to themselves. I share my tiny cabin with seven others bins was a whaling captain. Our black booze ran a luxury hotel, rosemary and lettuce who perished together in one of the earliest railway accidents were distressed, gentle women. They still are come to that. Scratch with some sort of Hill peasant Nagar longest serving resident appears to have been a caveman as far as any of us can tell. He smells astonishing, we unpleasant. Lastly, min tox thing babbles endlessly about her glorious life in an Imperial Palace of the Orient, and treat the rest of us with contempt. Throwing together with dead people whose lives were so different, it might be thought that the afterlife is one long round of fascinating conversations, broaden horizons and limitless opportunity to compare ideas, feelings, throbs, pangs, perceptions, and beliefs would that it was so unfortunately, language acquisition and indeed any kind of mental development simply does not happen here. vas nog is locked in his strange and distant world goes out of his mind with confusion when he sees a wheel for example, and spends most of his time grunting, hammering his fists on the floor and deprecating where the fancy takes him. bins told me an uproarious story about how he wants took nog with him to the butcher's vest and forced eight pints of grass down the poor rectories throat. In the resulting mayhem knock smashed the pub to smithereens before passing out quite happily in the sewer, where he spent the next year or so recovering. The fact that we all were virtually identical corduroy clothing also makes things difficult. You simply can't tell whether the person lounging by the bus stop is a 13th century Mongolian warlord a Victorian entomologist the murdered heir to the throne of Finland, a milkman from Wivenhoe an arch Druid, a CIA assassin, a Baltic potato farmer, one of Hannibal's ma hoot, Ethel read the unready or an ex Pope. The chances are that any attempt to make it light conversation will be doomed from the start through mutual unintelligibility. So after a while, you don't even bother to try. I've only been here six weeks and I'm already affected by this social lethargy

are cramped living conditions are intolerable. And it's not surprising that fights and squabbles are common. I tried to spend most of my time out and about going back home only to sleep. In my first week I made inquiries about changing cabins, but to do so is apparently impossible. By have a massive ledger at reception and they pencil in your name against whatever accommodation is available. And that's it forever and ever and ever. I have been given a job at the dairy. We have thousands of cows and efficient bottling plant, good refrigeration facilities and a delivery system that runs like clockwork but Milk is increasingly popular. And we also produce sour cream cheeses, yogurt, and very nice little cartons of way. Of course, fresh milk forms the bulk of our production. And although we no longer do home deliveries, we make sure that the milk kiosks are always fully stocked. After a month in the single cream department, I was promoted. I am now captain of the turns, and I wear a special badge.

The spiritualists among you will be pleased to hear that this place is fairly riddled with Ecto plasm. viscous refulgent and shimmering, it hovers above the rooftops curls in wisps in every room, darts hither and thither in the air, wherever one cares to look. What purpose it serves, is a mystery. There are scholars here of course, and many of them are using eternity to puzzle over this enigmatic substance. Books roll off the presses in frightening quantities. On a visit to the library last week, I noted the following titles all of them published since my arrival, the Ecto plasmic gasm tear the luster of Ecto plasm. To novels on a bite Ecto plasmas, essays in hieratic, crumpling heavens porridge, Ecto plasmic, phantasms and Ecto plasm new hub and Ibarguen gritty In summary, learned journals devoted to the subject are piled high in corridors and pavilions. hotton hate filled debates are broadcast on the radio has two or more experts disputing each other's theories shouting their heads off, and resorting to infant child bickering. True fanatics spend months at a time in the echo plasm Park near the railway sidings where the gleaming substance has somehow been corralled and controlled, hanging a low in the air above a large circle of verdant lawns. The visitor to the park is literally literally enveloped in ectoplasm, breathing it in through every pore. What the effects are of such exposure I do not know as I have yet to experience them. Needless to say those who visit the park come away with wildly different stories to tell. The letters columns of the Ecto plasm journals are full of first hand reports. The writers reactions varying from blinding ecstasy to stultifying boredom. I won't read out any of this verbiage here, you'll have time and laughter to read it when you're dead. I have yet to meet Captain snap, but stories about him are rife. Most of them seem to be about the various high jinks and scamper ease he got up to when he was alive. asked about his role in the afterlife, and there is an ominous, even terrified silence. Now what appears to know which cabin he lives in, if indeed he lives in a cabin at all. On a promontory by the mud wastes their Stanton enormous misshapen castle like something out of a child's nightmare. Some insist that Captain snap inhabited surrounded by minions, but this seems unlikely. Every month there are Shara bank outings to the castle and the tourist chosen by raffle ticket are able to roam all around it at will. Perhaps Captain snap hides in the broom cupboard or makes himself scarce during these visits. Who knows. Most people are only able to drink half a pint of the hoist before passing out. So rigorous training is necessary if one aspires to drink the four point pint necessary to join Captain snaps committee. As we've seen that gels here the committee's function is a mystery. Opinions vary. There are those who accused the committee of regulating every aspect of the afterlife. Other sites million drinking club bins swears blind that the members are able to return to Earth for short periods as ghosts, but for some reason, they're only able to haunt desolate winter wracked seaside resorts. I'm sure he's just making that up. As with ectoplasm, so with grace, there is a vast amount of it here. When I was alive, I remember that Christine's used to bang on about grace all the time. But I must admit I never worked out precisely What it was from what I did gather, however, I can confidently say that as with most aspects of the afterlife, they were very wide of the mark.

You see at reception, they give you a large tub of grace and tell you to look after it very carefully and not to open it until you get the word. Not that they're trusting. Being a curious sort. I tried to open my tab as soon as I got to my cabin, and discovered that it had a safety catch on the lid and nasty little mechanism which snapped over my fingers and clamp them tight against the tub. So the lie how the in agony bins chuckling at mine naivety sent me off to the tub inspectors who Fried my fingers, dab them with ointment, reset the catch and gave me a ticking off. As for the word upon receipt of which I can open my tab. To date, I've not met a single person who's ever been given it. Everybody has their pristine unopened tab. Some people carry them around with them. Although personally I find the pockets on our clothing are not roomy enough. You can buy a little wicker basket into which the tubs fit quite snugly, and you see those quite often. But like most people, I keep my tub of grace in a tiny wooden locker in my cabin. The postal system is charming, rickshaws stacked with packets and parcels and pulled along by brightly uniform Prussians career through the streets. If street is the correct word for the stinking muddy channels which criss cross our domain. For some reason, you have to be a Prussian who died during the 19th century to get a job as a postal worker. This seems to me rather unfair, and we're not so happy at the dairy, I would raise a stink about it. When I first learned about this closed shop employment practice, I assume that the Prussians got the jobs because with their stereotypical passion for order, they ran a tight ship and kept stern bureaucratic control. So potentially chaotic a service. I soon discovered how wrong I was. The great thing about the postal system here is that it's entirely random. You can write a letter, top a parcel, shove a few knickknacks into a packet, and deposit it in a post box, and you simply never know who the recipient will be. If you waste your time, carefully addressing your mail to a particular individual. You're summoned to the post office headquarters and made to do an hour's stamp licking duty. While ferocious hounds buy at you from an adjoining room. There is a big metal fence completely surrounding this place. It's electrified, I have spent long hours peering through it to measure beliefs or wires, trying to see what lies beyond it. But all I can make out is an indistinct Bayesian motion blur. A distant mesmerizing clamor is just about audible. Those who've tried to cross it have found themselves instantly surrounded by gangs of brutish myrmidons, whose golden helmet a burnished and gleaming, merciless and inexplicable, they enrapt their captives in great corduroy shrouds in toner litany of awfulness and dread, and convey them that hideous speed to the mezzanine floor of the big damp building, whence they are dispatched, muffled stricken and aghast into the shoot of wrack and ruin. As it was an clanks, they are forever swept away. They are swept away and gone.

That story was written at some point in the early 1990s. But it was republished two years ago, in we were puny, they were vapid, a spineless book or booklet of three early stories, three stories from the from the 1990s. One case I think we're in the 1980s which is available. If you go to the hooting yard website, which I'm sure you visited but if you go there you will see there are pictures of the covers of six books available. And I do recommend to all listeners that you buy all six books as Christmas gifts for as many of your family, friends, relatives and enemies as as you see fit. And speaking of Christmas today is of course December the first, which means that it's the first day when one opens the first window in a conventional advent calendar, hooting yard is doing its own advent calendar, which is not quite the same. What you have to do is get a very large piece of cardboard. And every day between now and Christmas, I shall be posting a picture on the hooting od website. So if you print that picture out on a piece of paper, cut it out with a pair of scissors and glue it to your piece of cardboard. You'll be able to walk in or and delight as each day. The pictures multiply until you have 25 pictures on your advent calendar. There'll be something to treasure. So if you go to hooting yard.org you will see the first picture of your advent calendar there. And while you're about it, don't forget to donate money to the hooting yard Christmas fund for distressed out of print pamphlet is now mentioned in that mentioned in that piece was mentioned that sorry mentioned in that piece was a castle, the misshapen castle like something from a child's nightmare. And I'm going to read to you about another castle now, it may be may even be a similar castle.

Bear with me. Once upon a time, there was a smelly castle. boy did it Pong. The Baron who lived there could not account for the rIq he was not a stinky person himself. Indeed, he Bade much more often than we do, usually in that time in that land, and he also doused himself in rich and heavy perfumes, brought to him from mysterious distant lands by a tenant perfume aaes. so offended with some of these travelers by the hideous stench, wafting through the castle that they could not bring themselves to cross the drawbridge. The Baron would have to come out of his castle and meet them in a field to take possession of their latest sense and tinctures. He felt this was beneath his dignity, to have to come and haggle in a field like a peasant. But on the other hand, it was quite a treat to be out in the fresh air for half an hour. The Baron had tried everything to read the smelly castle of its palm. He had the drains inspected, he scattered potpourris hither and thither he even called enough fumigation expert, or at least a man who announced himself as one. But all to no avail. The castle stank it was as simple as that.

I should have done that cough while a Caucasian lullaby was still on. here's here's some verse in a German forest sunken gloom, surrounded by men who spell my doom. Always Fritz's, Horst some Kurtz explained the depth of my Veldt Schmitz, but then they all fall to their knees attacked by German killer bees. And now my spirits are surely Boyd as I am filled with shodhan Freud. In another German forest tenebrous and dense, I stumbled through the Duff until I reached a fence. I followed the fence for miles rattling a stick was ever there a forest with German trees so thick was ever there are hiking her as thick as myself. The fence led me directly to the dwelling of an elf It was an elf of untold sin. It's hard as black as pitch, and with a hideous cackle, it shoved me in a ditch. I crawled through the ditch, but the trees grew thicker Still, the sky was blotted out, and I began to feel quite ill. I was undone by a German elf in a forest, darkened drill, and all because I did not have the proper hiking gear. So get your boots from humans and your compass to or else you will get stuck in the woods of Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo.

Frank Key  26:05
It might be argued that, that doesn't make a lot of sense, because first we're in one German forest, then we're in a second German forest. And at the end, we seem to be in the woods. Whoo hoo, hoo Dee Woo. All I can do is apologize for any inconsistency, and put it down to a desperation to find rhyming words. Anyway, before I go this week, I'd like to read you a short extract from manners and rules of good society, or solid isms to be avoided by a member of the aristocracy, published in 1916. We don't know the name of this particular aristocrat. But Christmas is a time for social occasions, so I thought I'd choose something from manners and rules of good society about a social occasion. There are many ways of arranging a water party at yachting stations and at all Riverside places at yachting stations. For instance, a sailing yacht is hired to convey a party of from 18 to 25, to some point of interest on the coast, in which case, luncheon and tea are provided at an hotel in the vicinity of the place where the party have landed, and the expenses are equally divided, not unfrequently. On the return journey, the yacht is becalmed, and does not reach its destination, until between two and three the following morning. If it happens to be a fine, moonlit night, this prolongation of a water party is an additional source of enjoyment. But if there is no moon, as well as no wind and the calm betokens a storm, it is the reverse of pleasant but these little contra Tom, when they do occur, rather lenders zest to the day's pleasure, and there's something to talk about afterwards. Wise words I think there and that's it for this week. I will be back next week with some more stuff by which time you will have six or seven more pictures to add to your hooting yard advent calendar. So get that cardboard and get some glue and a pair of scissors and a printer and ink and whatever else you may need a cup of tea bags. That's it for me for this week. Bye bye.
