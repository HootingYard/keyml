Blarney. Sorry about that as well.

Frank Key  00:30
Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. And it's too darn hot. Which is my way of demonstrating to you that this is a live show. Anything could happen. I don't know the exact temperature but is far too hot for me. Last week on the show, we had an ornithology special in which everything I read was about bird of one type or another, apart from one thing about a cow. And this is not going to be an ornithology special and yet there are more birds that I need to cover before we're done. So I'll press on with that straightaway. This is about the praten coal. The praten coal is a type of bird, beak, feathers, power of flight, etc. is something of a neglected bird. In a poll, when asked to list with a minimum of thought the first five birds that came into their heads, naught percent of respondents named the pratten call Excuse me. And there were a lot of respondents a lot. It was one of the biggest polls ever conducted by the praten colo philia society and the results caused its members severe disappointment. pratten colo fibia is the technical term given to the psychological state of attraction to pratten cold. This can vary from a casual regard and appreciation of the bird as when a person clomping about in the sort of environment where one might see a pratincole meadows and marshes in southern Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, spots one and smiles and says, gosh, what a delightful little pratincole or it can become a full blown crazed Adoration of the bird. Price in colo files. At the far end of the spectrum have been known to erect shrines and altars on which they place simulacra of the object of their obsession. Buy from Plaster of Paris, or plasticine, or wax, or marzipan. Occasionally, they might obtain a stuffed pratincole from a friendly taxidermist, taxidermist. These people are do loudly but harmless and you might be acquainted with one for years without suspecting the nature of their you know, mania, or even that they are maniacs at all. Commonly, the first hint you will be given is when the pratten colo file, speaking in a strangely heightened and excited tone of voice invites you into the inner sanctum, where in stands the shrine or altar to their bird. In these circumstances, the best thing to do, having pro prostrated yourself upon the floor. And Jabba the rumble with me of nonsense as bitten, is to pretend you have an urgent appointment, preferably on the other side of town, or in another town, or in another country or on another continent, and Scarpa without looking back. Next time you bump into your acquaintance, you would be advised to steer the conversation away from any bird related topics whatsoever. It's a curious fact, however, that high spectrum praten Cobo files often display absolutely not interested in any other types of birds. If anything, they say blisteringly ignorant about birds in general boffins have yet to identify the danger points which propel the casual or low spectrum pressing Kobo file that one clumping about with the parents but not killers in a healthy interest in other types of birds. To the bonkers level. It might have something to do with brain chemistry or exposure to air Bone toxins or trauma, though it's difficult to imagine what possible trauma could be occasioned by a little pratincole. Still, the Lord moves in mysterious ways as we know. And it would not be beyond his wit to think up some horror involving a maddened flock of Platinum coals and visited upon a poor benighted sold.

Frank Key  05:25
I'm often asked, Well, no, I'm not often asked. In fact, now I think about it. Nobody's ever asked me. Mr. Key, if there is such a condition as practicing colo philia. Is there a concomitant condition of pratten colo phobia? Should that question ever be put to me, and I hope it will be one day before I die. I will have an answer ready.

Frank Key  06:05
And the last bird we're going to talk about, possibly the last bird we're going to talk about this week is the rock our OC. The Rock is a type of bird. Actually, it's a fabulous bird, meaning it does not actually exist. So it's not entirely true to say it's a type of bird, we might instead say that the rock Excuse me. We might instead say that the rock is a type of bird imagined in the brain of persons long ago, or possibly just one person whose Phantasm was adopted by others, gay down the generations and to our own days. Fabulous is the root of the slang word fab, popular in the 1960s and surely overdue for a revival. The pop group, The Beatles were commonly known as the Fab Four. But that is not to suggest that like the rock, they did not actually exist. Or is it? Couldn't laughable mop tops be nothing more than a hallucination shared by millions? Could the Beatles be a stupendously complex work? concocted by the avant garde Japanese conceptual artist Yoko Ono? Born 1933. I'm not going to argue the case or provide evidence from my theory, in part because it is to use Ambrose bierce his favorite word Bosh, but it's something well worth thinking about. Next time you find yourself a loose end, as for example, when a few days go by without any new postage hooting yard. I know only too well, that in those lamentable circumstances, my readers are reduced to quivering jellies sobbing their little hearts out and biting great chunks out of their hearth rugs if they have hearth rugs to bite chunks out of, or indeed half for a half is present only when there is a fireplace. And with the advent of central heating, many homes are designed and built now without fireplaces, as George Harrison 1943 to 2001. once asked, isn't it a pity? Harrison was a member of The Beatles, either real or imagined by Ono. But he asked his question in a law in a song composed and recorded after the group's demise. Whether he ever existed or not. What we can say with certainty about Harrison is that he was fab. He was as fab as a rock. Which brings us back to the subject of our inquiry, the fabulous bird. What can be said usefully about a non existent bird? Not much really. I mean, what on earth is the point of babbling on about something that doesn't exist, and never has existed except as an idea inside people's heads. One cannot even say of the rock, as one can say of so many other types of birds. Oh, so many that it has a beacon feathers, its beak and its feathers or as imaginary as the rock itself. It's merely a spectral thing. Upon close examination, it disappears from view, like the Snark softly and suddenly vanishes away. There is possibly a scholarly essay to be written on whether the rock like the Snark was, in fact, a boojum. All along. We might ask the same question about George Harrison. The other three Beatles, having allowed that they were incredibly fab, but possibly fabulous. We might consider whether any all of them were Buddhism's. Some have identified their manager Brian Epstein 1934 to 1967 as the boojum indeed, as the boojum of Buddhism's. Again, I'm not going to give chapter and verse for the simple reason that my reference source is a as fabulous as the rock. I just made that up about that the Epstein boojum comparison, because I could, but now I've made it. And I've read it on the radio and posted it on his internet, it's become an idea, a concept, not unlike an Ono concept. Anybody typing in Epstein boojum comparison into a search engine to find it and read it. And thus sorry.

Frank Key  11:02
Anybody typing Epstein boojum comparison into a search engine will find it and read it. And that's it may spread like wildfire through the heads of millions, just as Yoko Ono's Beatles did, just as over longer centuries, the rock did, or the idea of the rock, that fabulous bird which never really existed at all.

Frank Key  11:58
And that was a special treat. pansy cradle drew is with us. And she's going to read something. From what what are you going to read to the pansy?

Unknown Speaker  12:10
Well, this is another excerpt from an old hitting yard favorite further science book 20 by Norman Davies. We've read from this many many times, but it never gets tired. I am have picked something a little unusual today and have to say this makes rather bad radio. But I've chosen one of Norman's pieces called Cloud art. Number five. Norman has illustrated this with small photographs of clouds, but I can reassure listeners that quite a lot of imagination is required to to see the the figures in these clouds. So let me just ask you to picture the perfect cloud in your mind. And then listen to the words and make it so

Unknown Speaker  12:59
cloud art five, old man crona Hummingbird lizard, Abraham, Turkish beggar, Bishop, child, which Swiss Lake pondering And finally, inshore lifeboat another XOR then this one a little bit easier to imagine. This is called Capability Brown.

Unknown Speaker  14:00
One, that the essence of Capability Brown was long, low noble VISTAs, with tree clumps of dull horizontal repeated segments, trees with a Greek temple between artificial as amongst trees to dead Greek ideal styles and dead calm Holly, you etc. Tree clumps with lakes etc. And finally, near death. One that people do know when they are dying, even the insensitive to that it appears that the conscious self soul sees the body from above it by the ceiling briefly contained by the room corners always from the foot end About a 20 foot range, followed by a tunnel of light, followed by a Green Park, etc, with known dead relations in it. Three, the explanatory sequence appears to be that, at death, the self awareness polarizes via the final expansion contraction in that order in the brain. For so that the self awareness has I use connection whilst expanded, using the room as its field confines to observe normally followed by ultra brain contraction awareness to the hence bright light excitement brain area, hence the tunnel of light. While the green garden seen it this period is a personal psychological interpretation of a common experience of final brain memory recall, ie in one practical person seen as a small green garden with all their relatives by another as a large Green Park of silent relatives, all in white gowns. Five at birth, one is looking up at doctors at death. One is looking down at doctors in action, et cetera.

Frank Key  16:41
What a fun man Norman Davis is was. Here is a piece called on the spittle of donkeys. Last weekend, Miss blossom partridges weekly digest, we considered the sputum of giraffes. So this week following the extremely complicated scheme devised for this series, we turn inevitably to the spittle of donkeys. We've looked at giraffe sputum in unnecessarily abstract theoretical manner, but when it comes to the spittle of donkeys, we're going to take a more practical approach. So roll up your sleeves, wash your hands with swarf eager and let's get down to business. The first thing you need to do is to find some donkeys do not for one minute think you can come a trespassing in my lovely bucolic donkey sanctuary however, it is surrounded by an electrified fence. And every hundred yards or so, there is a watch tower in which is perched one of my centuries, armed with a high velocity snipers rifle. Step over the whitewashed line parallel to the fence and you will be shot in the center of your forehead. I do not Bandy about the word sanctuary loosely. Far better that you go to the seaside where donkeys are often to be found giving rides along the beach to overexcited tots. The sensible donkey master may not take kindly to you collecting spittle from one of his donkeys. So what you will need to do is to do one away from the pack. Pick a donkey that is not at the time laden with a squealing infant on it back. A small bale of straw ought to be sufficient temptation for the donkey. But you will need to ensure the donkey masters attention is distracted. This can be accomplished for example, by setting fire to an ice cream kiosk elsewhere on the beach. While the donkey master is gazing, open mouth that the conflagration wave the small biome of straw in the face of your chosen donkey and you're it away until you are concealed by sand dunes or some similar seaside beach feature.

Frank Key  19:14
Do not fret your little head about being charged with donkey abduction. Once you've collected it spittle, you're going to return the donkey whence you found it no harm done. Before so returning it, you will again need to divert the donkey masters attention. For this purpose, it can be useful to have an accomplice a stooge who swims out to sea and then pretends to be drowning, frantically waving their arms and shouting. But we're leaping ahead of ourselves drooly hidden behind goons or similar. You can begin to feed handfuls of straw to the donkey as it manifests. This special will be produced from various glands in its mouth. I will not go into the precise physiological details. Just bear with me. Now, while with one hand, you tear off portions of straw from the bale, and stuffed them into the donkey's mouth with your other hand, you should be holding a bowl under his chin to collect such spittle as it dribbles and drools. Remember that some donkeys slobber while eating more than others, and do not hit any panic buttons. provided the donkey monkey straw for about 10 minutes. You should almost certainly produce a sufficient spittle to fill your bowl if not to the brim then as near as dammit. When you're happy with the amount of donkey spittle in your bowl, transfer it to a flask by means of a siphon and a funnel. Put the patent the donkey on its head to show your appreciation. Then use your walkie talkie to alert your accomplice who should come scampering out as a chalet in a swimming costume and hair across the beach and plunge into the sea and swim out and then pretend to be drowning and wave and scream. peering out from behind the goons. Make sure the donkey master is distracted and read the donkey back, inserting it among the other donkeys as if it had never been away. If an infant is loitering nearby, pick it up and plop it onto the donkeys back. Then, when the donkey master turned round to scan his donkeys. He will be even less likely to think one of them has been viewed away behind the sanctions to have its spittle collected. You can now go home. In your kitchenette, pour the donkey spittle out of the flask into a container. There will almost certainly be a few strands of Munch straw intermingled with the spittle. So pick them out with a pair of tweezers and discard them in your bin. Do the same with any other foreign bodies that have found their way into the container until you have 100% pure donkey spittle. This can then be used for a vast range of different purposes, most of which hark back centuries and have come down to us through rustic law and wisdom. While you ponder to precisely what purpose you intend to put the spittle of the donkey. Take a moment to thank your lucky stars that you live in an enlightened age. Have you been found poring over a container of donkey spittle? virtually any time in those past centuries, you would have been burned as a witch.

Unknown Speaker  23:30
We turn now from fiction to Stranger Than Fiction. Here are some excerpts from Mr. Keys shorter, potted brief, brief lives. Powered Frankie, English comedian 1917 to 92 Howard's childhood ambition was to become a saint. When instead he turned to the theater, he appeared under the stage name's Ronnie or dex and Frankie Howard the borderline case adhirata addition he performed the soliloquy from Hamlet, while clutching his packed lunch, the bag split and covered his audience with bread and cheese. Amazing really that he went on to have a stellar career that he did.

Frank Key  24:25
That was without first pseudonym he used

Unknown Speaker  24:30
Ronnie or Dec

Frank Key  24:31
Ronnie or Depp's Ronnie All right. Ronnie Horta asks catchy

Unknown Speaker  24:35
isn't it? I might go on and read one more to us all. Or even to really okay. Hubbard l Ron. American mountebank 1911 286. The urtext of Scientology is Hubbard's book Excalibur, which contains the secrets of the universe. His best selling Dianetics was based on a single chapter of the earlier work. Written in a six day frenzy after Hubbard was apparently clinically dead for eight minutes following a dental extraction. Excalibur was later advertised thus, Mr. Hubbard wrote this book in 1938. When for the first 15 people who read it went insane, Mr. Hubbard withdrew it and placed it in a vault, where it remained until now. copies to selected readers only, and then non signature, released only on sworn statement not to permit other readers to read it contains data not to be released during Mr. Hubbard's stay on Earth. facsimile of original, individually typed for manuscript buyer, gold bound and locked signed by author Larry limited per copy. 1500 dollars.

Frank Key  26:07
That sounds like a good sales pitch to me. Do you think that would work with a hosting yard book? Found in gold, locked in a casket

Unknown Speaker  26:16
bound to the gold locked in the casket? Okay. Oh, yeah, that works for me.

Frank Key  26:22
two copies available?

Unknown Speaker  26:24
two copies?

Frank Key  26:25
I think I've charged more than 1500

Unknown Speaker  26:27
I think you would have to Yes, I think you'd have to. It's you need to find a sort of single word name for it, don't you really preferably after a sword of some sort. And to finish if that's alright, I'll read about Hugh of Lincoln, an English saint from 1135 or 40. To 1200. Hugh of Lincoln is the patron saint of swans. He developed a deep and lasting friendship with a white swan from the Lincolnshire town of Stowe. The Swan followed him everywhere he went, guarded him while he slept, and attacked anyone who came near him. See Pavlova Anna. And to find out why I think you'll have to turn into the next next episode of Hootie neon.

Frank Key  27:19
Yeah, tune in next week. And we'll tell you about Hannah Pavlova and her swarm. Yeah, that's all for this week. Just a quick note to any anyone any of you who enjoy reading the website, which I'm sure is most of you. You may notice if we try and go there that you will find a little sign saying hooting armed is down for maintenance. That's a bit like being down with the kids, but it's down for maintenance. And it's entirely true. There's been some all sorts of jiggery pokery going on. And so it needs to be cobbled back together. And I have two boffins at work on it one in one in this country and one in New Zealand working tirelessly to bring hooting our back. So I don't know when that's going to be but soon hopefully. And when it's back, there'll be more prose to read and other stuff like that. So don't panic if you can't find hooting yard it will return as well. May and pansy Will you be here next week?

Unknown Speaker  28:35
A possibly possibly possibly

Frank Key  28:37
possibly where the pansies was next week, Anna Pavlova, and her Swan will be bye bye
