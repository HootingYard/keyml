Good evening This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for approximately 30 minutes. And I sometimes get requests from listeners to reread things that are read many moons ago sometimes years. And I'd like to begin this week show with with to two such requests. And, in fact, they'll probably take up most of the show actually, but anyway, I'll begin with a recipe for gruul. You will need the following ingredients out water. The following equipment is essential. A big pot, a big spoon, the Holy Bible. On a blustery winter's day, with a chill in the very marrow of your poor poor bones. Take the big pot and carry it trudging through snow to the rusty spigot on the other side of the village. weeping, use what little strength you have to turn the spigot until a woeful dribble of brackish water appears. Make sure you place the big iron pot under the drip, so that water collecting it. With luck and prayer, you should find that the pot is about three quarters full before Twilight. When of course the village curfew comes into effect. The evil Grand Vizier proclaimed so in his use case, to make sure that all pious people are behind their latched and bolted doors by nightfall. Place the big pot on your oven and set it on full. Remember that it can take electric cookers longer to heat up than gas ones, but do not despair. Once your ovens maximum heat is reached, the water will bubble away like nobody's business. To prevent steam escaping it's a splendid idea to cover the pot if long ago when you were feckless, you lost or mislaid the lid of your pot. Or if indeed your pot never had a lid for not all pots do. You can of course improviser lead using all sorts of debris strewn Higgledy Piggledy about your hovel, but just be sure to use flame resistant debary please. Now, while you're waiting for the water to come to the boil, you can go and find the oats while I take a well earned nap. Let's have a little musical interlude. At this point there would normally be a musical interlude but we'll crack on. I'm now fully rested and in tip top condition. Let's press on without further ado, for by now your pot of water should be boiling. Please pay attention as the next step if fumbled, will put paid to your dearest wish, which is to make a successful pot of Grewal. with your right hand, scoop some oats from the pail. Grasp the lid of the pot if there is one in your left hand and lift it free of the pot. Cast the handful of oats into the season cauldron and Replace the lid. You may repeat this step once or twice, but on nother count overdo the oats as this will spoil your greubel making it too thick. And as the only remedy for this would be to add more water, you would have to return to the spigot breaking the village curfew and so risk being clubbed within an inch of your life by merciless curfew cadets and your Gribble in perfect though it may be would then go to waste sin upon sin. You will now free to allow the contents of the pot to boil merrily away. Although of course, from time to time, you ought to brandish the big spoon in your fist and give the gruel to be a mighty stir. In the intervals between stirrings you must on no account remain idle. This is the perfect time to read improving passages from the Bible. Indeed, why not throw open your door stand up bright and magnificent in your weed choked yard and to claim the scriptures in a booming voice for the benefit of whoever may be within earshot in the vast and pitiless night to little reminders, However resounding your declaration do not allow into your tone even the most miniscule taint of vanity. Remember that you are merely a vessel and a singularly unlovely vessel at that, a tarnished urn, say, or a grubby beaker.

Second, do not forget the pot for if it is neglected, you're likely to make not Grewal, but an inferno. Oh, I said two reminders, but there is a third, use your cough to rub a modicum of grind from your hovel window. Do you see a bleak and illimitable Vista of ice and snow? Are you marooned in an Arctic wasteland? If so, you may succumb to the delusions of peerblock tau, in which case you should refrain from following the directions of this recipe until you are relieved of your symptoms and are restored to your usual vigor. I need hardly point out the dangers of cooking when you are bonkers. All I have written an excellent little book entitled safe and simple snacks for the bit designed and the fraught, which is charmingly illustrated. The original pencil sketch of a cream cracker has been framed and displayed on the wall of my splendid restaurant in hemoglobin towers. Where were we is once the girl is fully boiled. Replace the Bible on your lectern or somewhere at any rate, where it will be safe from defilement. If such a cranny exists in your hovel. Hold the spoon in your right hand removing the pot lid with your left give that Grewal one last stir. Remove from heat allow us to stand for 10 minutes. Using a monstrous ladle, transfer into preheated tin bowls and serve best eaten with a spoon suitable for home freezing.

The second request is a piece called key side harpy. Ordinarily when we think of harpies we think of Aiello, Ossie pate, and collana or actually sometimes known pod arJ, the three sisters of Greek myth, Byrd women who kept stealing and befouling food from phineas and were generally vicious, violent and cruel. Tennyson called them, these prodigies of maryada nakedness is and twisted shapes of lust unspeakable abominable strangers at my heart, not welcome, harpies. miring every dish, but that may be more a reflection of the poet's fevered mental state than of the destructive wind spirits themselves. It would certainly be a calumny upon the character of bitrix kamboj The so called key side harpy who haunted the harbor of Oh hooligans Wharf that benighted sludge some seaside town a days horse ride away from hemoglobin towers, if of course you point your horse to south and if of course your horses Vinnie and fit and not lame nor tubercular nor otherwise incapacitated. You might think it is simple matter to keep your horse healthy. But no, our equine pals are subject to a host of terrible terrible diseases, lock jaw, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, equine colic foal pneumonia, summer seasonal recurrent dermatitis, and equine wobblers syndrome are among the ones to look out for next time you're hanging around at the stables. And there's a very helpful website with the admirably informative address www dot horse dash diseases.com to which you can refer Don't forget to insert a hyphen between horse and diseases By the way, or you will go astray as indeed you will go astray if you point your healthy horse in any direction other than South when riding from hemoglobin towers to Oh hooligans Wharf in order to seek out biktrix kamboj the key side harpy who of course are meant to be talking about allow me to Just prick the back of my hand with a long pin that will help to concentrate my mind. I usually use a lady's antique hat pin for what something can melodramatic practice, but believe me, a tiny amount of bloodshed is well worth it to keep awake and alert when one might otherwise not off into snooze world, particularly embarrassing when babbling into a microphone in the middle of a live radio show that I can read and die but the puncture in my hand with a disinfected rag at the same time. So let's move on. Beatrix kamboj wanted to be a harpy from girlhood after she read about the mythical bird women in a little book entitled, harpies and other things fluttered at the rim of cooking vessels in ancient Greece, by DAX blieb, the notorious children's writer and historian who wrote from his cell in a big forbidding prison perched on a promontory where he was incarcerated for life after causing a series of railway disasters. The book spurred the tiny girl's imagination, but it was not as if hers was a humdrum childhood. both of her parents were vampires, or beard of a fairly nondescript variety. Not for them remote castles and sweeping black capes and glistening crystal decanters from which to pour the blood they drank. Mr. And Mrs. kamboj we're lonely sorts reduced on occasion to squeezing the last drop of gore from a fly or a blue bottle slapped with a rolled up periodical. something of a postural bitrix his father tried to put it about that he was the eponymous theme in Charles Ives is song slugging a vampire 1902. So this was clearly twaddle. His only tenuous connection with the composer being a brief tenure, Hawking pencils and pencil sharpeners on the ferry across the Atlantic, Stockbridge.

By the time bitrix was born, the Cambodians had moved far, far from the Housatonic fetching up in a village that was scarcely more than a clump of unsightly wooden sheds a village so remote and dilapidated that it did not even have a name. There is a surprising number of employment opportunities in such a godforsaken spot for a wasp Roland, his wife, who would shrivel to dust at the first ray of sunlight come the dawn, although I can't for the life of me think what they might be. I puzzled over this and a kind friend suggested to me that perhaps the Cambodians made a living by creeping around at night laying traps for mold and badgers and weasels. So let's assume that that's what they did, and that farmers there abouts paid them well for their exertions that would at least explain how they came to be able to afford to send the young bitrix to a finishing school somewhere in the Habsburg Empire, where she first encountered the works of dachte blieb and set her heart on becoming a harpy. She had wanted to be a bird, she learned that as the child of vampires, she could never ever be transformed into a Starling, or a limit or a night jar or an attack, not even into a bufflehead or a crow. It was a cruel lesson, but she did not let it crush her spirit. Instead, she spent hours with the finishing school seamstress up in that weird cold, crooked beam, dusty style, attic sticking and stitching, until she'd fashioned for herself a pair of bright resplendent wings with a span so wide when fully unfold that the old seamstress gave a gasp and swooned clattering to the floor like a pile of dry sticks. And in her happy heart bitrix exalted at her power. She would have liked to fly away from the school by launching herself from the rooftops but she was a sensible girl. She removed her wings and folded them up and stuck them in a tote bag and carried on with the day through lessons and deportment and watercolor and Piccolo and pastry finesse and recital of 20 verses by DAX bleb. And only when the time came for the afternoon embroidery lesson to tree flit away to a side door and off into the mountains, while the staff and pupils went scurrying in search of their seamstress now stumbling stand and blinded about the attic bashing into mannequins and tearing her paper taut skin on scattered Needles and Pins she could no longer see and bitrix wandered in the mountains, stretching her tablet And organdy wings striking fear into cow herds and their cows. Stories of the flightless bird woman circulated in the taverns. to assuage her rough offerings of food were left for her in huts and shelters and hermitages. Sometimes reckless young pups armed themselves with their father's rifles and strode up into the foothills, trying not to choke on the tobacco pipes they clenched between their immature drawers, or bluster and braggadocio, hot, fat Happy hunting. bitrix by now had perfected a shriek of such ferocity that the blood of those who heard it could have provided her vampire parents with plenty of ice popsicles. experimenting on the cows and cow herds. She had learned that a few energetic flapping of her wings, accompanied by her streak could keep her safe from harm. Each and every gun toting young fool who came in her pursuit, returned to his village shriveled and slobbering and deranged. Most of them had to be locked away in gloomy cellars, their families shameful secret, quietly fed on slops for years and years, and never spoken of again. Perhaps they were the lucky ones for their village pals, who is strewed the Harpy hunt for one reason or another, will soon to perish in the trenches, the Great War doing for them what it did for the Habsburg Empire in which they had grown. And it was at the end of that terrible conflict. That bit tricked Cambodia at last came down from the mountains and made her way vaguely and without any real purpose across war torn lands until one bright day in 1921. She fetched up on the key side that oh hooligans Wharf, and if she stayed,

Beatrix realized soon enough that she inspired not one whit of terror in the rattled and retired old sea dogs who haunted the key side. These were ancient and crusty mariners who chewed fish heads when they were not downing tankards of salt, water and Grog, and most of them had seen things far more terrifying than bitrix in their years upon the high seas. pegleg Pinsent for example. Over 100 years old, with Brian for blood, who now slumped, collapsed and crappy Island and a key side kiosk, was thought to have seen so many ship ghosts that he shook still, as he'd been shaking for 90 years or more. Ever since, as a callow cabin boy, he had clambered into the crow's nest of the HMS corrugated cardboard, to be confronted with a sea soaked goon, which intoned a dreadful litany of incomprehensible maritime gibberish into his innocent ear. The goal was spindly it pulsated like a jellyfish. It gave off an odor of barnacles on Rotten death, and it loomed above the tiny boy. Its boneless yet bony seeming fingers clutching at his sleeve, leaving a trail of slime, which no amount of soaking in pile after pile of borax and boiling water would ever expand. At the end of that first voyage, the young Pinsent took the tunic home to his mom, supposing her laundry skills equal to any and every stain, ghouls, smeared or otherwise, and that good woman left for a shirt with a shriek, a shriek compared to which bitrix is harpy How was like the song of the nightingale she had as an infant wanted to be. I Young Miss croak pegleg Pinsent as bitrix sheltered in his kiosk during a rainstorm on her first day on the key side, I saw many a ship ghost, and I saw ghost ships to our show, I saw shapes in the night sky that should not have been there and heard wailings and screams emerging from the depths, and I smelled things no sailor or ever smell and touched what no sailor or ever touch and all of that, on my very first voyage, Miss nine years old and plying the foul oceans on the corrugated cardboard. Now then, Mr. Pinsent, said Beatrix, balancing a dainty tea cup on her lap for harpies. Oh, she was she had not forgotten her Habsburg finishing school manners. You have spoken of Eldrick experiences involving four of the centers. But what of the fifth? Did you ever taste something no sailor or whatever taste as you would put it, actually posed this question three. Unfold one wing a little just to see if it had any effect on the Ancient Mariner who's beards seem to be alive with tiny crawling forms of marine life not easy to identify. He did not pay her wing any attention as he replied, heart attack biscuits riddled with worms mess. That was my diet, then as it is my diet now, he said. So the answer to your question has to be no, I suppose. I see, said Beatrix demurely sweeping from her lap the crumbs of a cake she had bought at a neighboring kiosk. As she did so she flapped her one unfold wing with a certain eerie menace and prepared to display the second pegleg Pinsent took no notice that he was lost and shaking in goo reverie, occasionally slurping from a tin tumbler of rum or brine, or rum and brine. He couldn't tell anymore. The interview petered out, polite bit rich thank the old sea dog for his time and shelter, and must his filthy hair before striding out onto the key side deep in thought. Clearly her harpy dumb had failed to discombobulate the grizzled marine person. It was true, she had not sad to shriek at him, but with his long experience of sea shrieking she surmised that his composure would have remained on rattled. night fell on Oh hooligans Wharf on that Wednesday. Under fact, shimmering stars bitrix huddled down under a greasy green tarpaulins she found abandoned at a stretch of the key side where orcs and skewers gathered. Far from their hectic Tavern raucous with shanties. She took off her wings and folded them into her tote bag and placed it as a pillow and lay down among birds lulled to sleep by the waves lapping against the rotting and crooked timber of the jetty.

She dreamed hoppy dreams, ferocious and merciless and demented. She stole food from kings who are displeased their gods. descending into the infernal regions, she sank her savage talents into the bellies of suicides. She tormented, unhappy sinners bound for Tartarus she luxuriated in the filth and stench of her Island nest. And when she woke on Tuesday, on Thursday morning, the orcs and skewers flown away and she was alone on the key side, her wings packed in her pillow. She jumped into the sea and swam elegantly actually had been taught to do at finishing school, and then she climbed out and shook herself and preened like a seabird on a rock, and she retrieved her tote bag and put on her wings and shrieked and shrieked, and then she put it off along the key side towards a crumbling ruinous hut, where a signboard promised breakfast, and she sat down at a rickety wooden table, its surface smeared with the slime of a ship's goon, surrounded by sea dogs in tatty. unraveling, sweaters stiff with wax, their rubber boots squelching and leaking, and she tapped into a breakfast of cockles and mussels and herring and lobster and squid and boiled water from a tide pool. A cup alive with tiny wriggling marine beings, somehow happy at home here, far from her finishing school in the mountains of what once had been the Habsburg Empire. Little bit tricks kamboj the key side harpy of Oh, hula Holmes Wharf.

And probably to end this week show a brand new piece which is not a repeat because it was constructed mostly from Canvas and cloth and the canvas and cloth were fed on by mouth, the temple of whom fat Gar is sometimes known as the moth eaten Temple of whom fat Gar ravaged by mosques and time and lashed by wild winds that blow across the top pooter. It is a wonder the temple still stands. 1000 years after the first devotees entered it through the sacred flap. It has of course been much patched and stitched over the centuries, and its fabric is regularly stiffened with starch, carried in canisters for miles upon miles by worshipers of the hideous bat God fatso, for it is he to whom the temple is dedicated? The Wild winds that lash and batter the temple are meteorologically very interesting. Indeed. Students of the weather have been perplexed by them ever since modern wild wind studies began before our scientific age, of course, the sheer weirdness of the winds that blow across the top pooter was ascribed to the Mercurial and petulant nature of the hideous back God fatso. Very, it was thought that he was responsible for them as he was for everything in the universe. We're wiser now, but no closer to getting to grips with the wild, lashing winds. Those who still believe in fat, so have a simple explanation. for them. The winds are the physical manifestation of the temperament of fat souls magic pig. Actually, he has two magic pigs, but we can safely ignore one of them for a moment or two. The idea is that this particular pig, which it must be understood is not a real pig in any sense, somehow sends the winds howling across the top pooter whenever it is fractures or hungry or obstreperous, or mad and or otherwise out of sorts. Why the hideous back God fatso does nothing to placate his magic pig is an ineffable mystery. The religion dedicated to him is short on theologians of any stripe. Although one of the few to have addressed the problem, contended that fatso spent much of his time pacifying the other magic pig, which, if ever it fully awakened, would make the wild winds that batter the temple seem like tiny pipsqueak gusts of summer breeze. Other so called scholars argued this implied the other magic pig was somehow more powerful than fat so himself a clear heresy. So the first theologian was put in a Crusher and crushed there used to be at least five crushes on the mud playing around the temple of Hoon, fat Gar, so we must assume that there were plenty of heretics to be crushed. Occasionally, a bright young with a snapper archaeologist will announce plans for a dig at the site, hoping to exuma fantastical horde of crushed bones, but not one of these schemes ever succeeds. It said that fatso himself, sabotage the expeditions by causing shipwrecks and helicopter crashes and by pickling the archaeologist, brains wildlife sleep. In these ploys, he calls on the assistance of his flock of Britons. Unlike the two pigs, the bitterns are not magical, but nor of course, are they real, their Phantom spectral bitterns, beholden to fat so for some service, he did them in the distant past. We cannot guess what that might have been, for. It's a topic suspiciously neglected by all the priests and wizards and jumping about men who interpret fatso to his followers, or I should say, who used to do so. There are none of them left alive today, at least none that we know of believers in fats over a dwindling banned, often greasy and myopic and spindly and gormless. They tend to lack Erlang. Most of them probably would be crushed in the crushes if the crushes were still were. Because one thing we could be quite clear about the hideous bad God fatso is that he expected His devotees to cut a dash. There may have been few opportunities for glittering social panache on the prehistoric tar pooter especially with those wild wins. But what rare chances there were seized on by fat toes followers,

great attention was paid to the angles of hats, the tying of cravats and affectations of toffee nosed insouciance. This is not to discount a concomitant yearning for the mud encouraged by one of the magic pigs. So today, there are few hallway canisters of starch for miles and miles to stiffen the moth eaten canvas and cloth of the temple of Hoon, fat Gar, perhaps in 100 years, there will be none at all. Yet fatso himself will still, as far as he is concerned, hold sway over the universe, and his magic pig will still make the wild winds blow and his other even more frightening magic pig will doze and slumber dreaming of havoc. It's easy for us to dismiss their very existence, until that is we have struggled stylishly across the inhospitable tar pooter and stooped down to crawl through the sacred flap to enter the temple. Then we see what all those believers through the century saw a site So magnificent and terrifying that we sprawl helplessly in the mud shrieking brains but designed garga for the gold of all goals. And I'll be back in three weeks time after two weeks when I won't be here, because there'll be other things on resonance as the end of this week show bye bye
