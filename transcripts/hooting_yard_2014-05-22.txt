Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is heating yard on the air. We still have the music summer season. Coming to you live from the Science Museum, which is incredibly exciting. Apart from that it will be the same old show with the same old stuff. There are some questions we can answer without hesitation. asked what's your favorite website 100% of sensible people immediately shout, hooting yard of course, with unhinged and hysterical enthusiasm. Similarly, when asked in which school Book Depository, they would prefer to cite a sniper's nest, an overwhelming number of would be assassins reply, the Texas School Book Depository at 411 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 752023317. Without a doubt, For my part, and in spite of the intervening decades, a question I can answer without even thinking is, what was your favorite Weekly Comic when you were tiny? It was the hammer of Christ, and within it, the strip I most adored was busta and rad board. Each week, I followed the adventures of the chirpy pair with my jaw dropped and drool flowing freely down my chin, my heart and pulse rate pounding desperately. It was through busta and rad board that I learned to read, and I am forever in their debt. They were in many ways and Ill matched fictional pair. Buster was squat, hissy and preening given to throwing fits and always a tide and a bright yellow duffle coat, and a little pointed wooden cap. He existed on a diet of chocolate Swiss rolls, sprats, letters, and untreated milk straight from the goat. We were never given a glimpse of the goat. But it was understood that it lived in a field a short walk across the verdant hills from pastor's house, and then its name was Buttercup. Bust pasta had more than one iron pail in which he could collect the milk, one painted red and one unpainted, and a third extra special pail that leaked and that he was always promising to mend but never did. But pastor had too many teeth crammed inside his mouth, certainly more than a non fictional person would have. And some of them were sharpened into fangs. He liked to sit atop a rotating, cleanse and spin round and round until he was sick. I was always curious as to the engine which rotated the plinth. It bore a distinct resemblance to undersea drilling equipment I had seen either in real life or in catalogs. Although of course, nearly all of Buster and redbuds Adventures took place on dry land, far from the sea. Bastard was once or twice shown to be in possession of a pair of swimming trunks by were visible in pictures of his open wardrobe alongside a snorkel and an oxygen canister. But I cannot recall ever seeing him I cannot recall ever wearing them. Basta had an owl as well as a goat. The owl was also called Buttercup and Buster treated it cruelly often pelting it with the shells of pistachio and Brazil that throughout the impossibly long afternoons of his idyllic fictional summertime. The owl took it to revenge by regurgitating gobbets of semi digested stoat or weasel onto busters pointed wooden cap, which he would then have to rinse clean, and other villagers figured. Doing so was always a risky business. For lumbering in the vicinity of the village that was the village wrestler, hairy brute, capable of tearing an anvil in half with his great hairy hands. Luckily for buster, the village wrestler was chained to a post next to the religious bigot, and he was blind. So usually it was possible to skip nimbly out of his reach, even though being squat Buster was not The most nimble of cartoon characters. Indeed, he was not nimble at all. He slouched and he trudged, and he often trailed one of his legs behind him as if he were a lame child. But this was just rough scality.

Buster pretended to be lying to digital small coinage from shopkeepers and the ground staff at the aerodrome, but most of them were wise days trick. And quite a few stories bust and redboard mooched around the aerodrome trying to enter the hangars, but they were invariably stymied by one circumstance or another, be the weather or early closing, or an attack of killer bees, or a rusty padlock. One side we're about to step into an unguarded and unlocked hangar when they were surprised by the ghost to Sylvia towns and Warner, and fled screaming into the hills. Other literary phantoms haunted the comic strip from time to time, for differing narrative purposes, are not always at the aerodrome. The Ghost of Emily Dickinson for example, hovers in midair outside the village shampoo list in several frames have a particularly exciting adventure, in which a toggle on busters duffle coat is discovered to be a smooth round fragment from the tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. Buster hires a broom to fight off the ancient Egyptian ghouls who come to reclaim the pharaohs toggle. the hiring of brooms, sweeping brushes, dusters, squeegees rags, and other cleaning materials is one of busters hobbies, along with bell ringing, stamp collecting, making fluted paper cupcake cases. pal thing is owl with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts. First World War battle reenactments, tongue twisters, snakes and ladders playing songs from the foot Marge Memorial dump LP on the glockenspiel, churning up frost in a pile, bandage sculpture, tic tac tacky talk, driving nails into mud idols subu to table football, poop tack class attack with ping pong, hopping about flapping his arms conjuring tricks, removing splinters from gafas cardboard appreciation, amateur dramatics pencil sharpening scattering pins all over the place, bowling balls and dishes and running a flea circus. I thought of Buster rather than rad board as a role model. Buster had nonchalance around a filthy temper already wet and peevishness. He was insouciance when one of his lungs collapsed. He smoked detains. He sometimes wore his pointed wooden cap at a jaunty angle. He could hold his breath underwater for several very very tense minutes. He rattled the bath and a fantastic old jalopy. He had ambitions to be a bar G or an X on an extensive system of canals. He was a dab hand with a banjo, and not in a musical sense. Once he felled the blind Bruce really Dressler with a simple flick of his duffle coat calf, and afterwards had the grace to polish the blind Brook village restless chain with a hired rag and his own homemade swore fieger. He dazzled at cocktail parties. He spat upon hissing coals. He tiptoed from rooms with a swish of elegance. He was off on a frolic of his own red board by contrast with a somewhat colorless character. Recently, I learned that a complete set of the hammer of Christ comic bound in the height of a cloven hooved beast of the barnyard, and containing all the adventures of Buster and red bird will be for sale was an auction to be held at the dilapidated Custom House by the harbor steps in this stinking seaside resort, where I usually spend my holidays. I am by no stretch of the imagination, an experienced auction goer and I have no idea how to make a bid. Do I not or raise an eyebrow or hold up a pencil or flail my arms around? I do not want to cast an idiotic figure. But nor do I want to miss the chance to get my hands on such a treasure. It's a quandary to be sure

Frank Key  10:01
haven't given it much thought, I've decided to take my lead from Buster himself. In one episode of this most marvelous of comic strips, he goes to an auction at a Custom House, not unlike the auction at the Custom House I plan to attend. And when the lot he covets comes up, he sneaks outside and through an Africa pumps into the auction room, a fast acting nerve gas. Or maybe it's just any old gas. I can't quite remember. I suppose that something I have to check before carrying out my nefarious plan. If I pump the wrong sort of gas through an aperture, who knows what might happen? The problem is that just as I'm ignorant to a bidding behavior of auctions, I haven't got a clue about gases. I know there are lots of different kinds of gas, and they act differently upon the people gathered in a room into which one or other of them is pumped through an aperture. But how am I to go about picking my gas is an absolute mystery. And so for now, it shall remain further as much that Trumps gas research in my daily round. And right now I feel as I so often do, the call of the monkey and I must pick nets out of my hair and shovel bananas down my throat and swing from large to Sycamore in my large and Sycamore enclosure beyond the back garden. By the railway lines were hooting freight trains Sunder along the track carrying vast loads of pig iron to pig on town where I have never been and will never go for it is far far away and built entirely from pig iron.

REMAX I have a bit of theme music here, but that doesn't seem to be happening. So I'm gonna just press on. I mentioned Sylvia Townsend Warner there briefly. And I learned the other day that in 1927 Edith Sitwell invited Sylvia Townsend Warner to a party house. And Sylvia Townsend Warner attended the party but she didn't enjoy it. She said that they only get the only other guests were young male poets and elderly female rasters. Now, given that this was 1927 and given that the party was either set wells house, I think Sylvia Townsend Warner must have been using the word Rasta in a different sense to the one we may understand it today. But I'd like to think she did mean Rastafarians and that secretly either sit well, with a elderly female Rastafarian. Anyway, I'll leave. I'll leave that with you to think about and here's another story. This is called meetings with remarkable hours. Dobson's pamphlet meetings with remarkable owls out of print is a curious work. Ostensibly, it's a simple account of a walk he took, excuse me. Through the owl sanctuary at screen Hoon, Puj and of the owls he came across they're given the unfathomable depth of his all of the logical ignorance. One is tempted to suggest that the pamphleteer only knew the birds he met with owls because of the big neon signage of the gate of the sanctuary. more remarkable when the owls themselves surely is the fact that Dobson was able to get anywhere near them in the first place. Ever since the so called inexplicably spooky event that centered on screwed Home Food farm yard. The entire area had been cordoned off by a massive security fence, patrolled by wolves and wild hog. There had always been talk of the airy bomb and the mutant I'll be no hands and the disturbing well, to say nothing of the farmyard itself. But after what happened on that wild and windy October weekend. So great was the terror in the surrounding villages that the fence was erected overnight, and the wolves and wild hogs let loose around the perimeter.

Frank Key  15:01
Dobson says nothing of this, were asked to believe that he was out and about pounding the countryside one day, when he found himself at the gate of the owl sanctuary and decided to investigate. This cannot be right. To get to the gate, he would first have had to find a way through the sanctuary fence without being savaged by wolves or wild hogs, then have had to cross the perilous bugs. Avoid the piano wire strung across the pathways clamber up the impossibly steep sludge bank, find his way through the midst in crowded field riddled with conceal pits in which killer spiders lay in white and pass through the notorious Spinney of poisonous trees. Even had he accomplished all that he would somehow have had to persuade the centuries that the owl sanctuary gate, that he was a bonafide visitor, or they would have shot him on the spot and buried his corpse where it would never ever be found. The centuries were hand picked, undergoing rigorous psychological testing to flesh out any who had a less than fanatical protective instinct towards owls.

Dobson was not a particularly boastful man. But he did have an operatic divas sense of drama, and it seems scarcely credible, that he would let pass the opportunity to prattle on about so death defying a journey. So we must be grateful for the research done by indefatigable Dobson is Ted tack, who's recently published paper suggests that some weird properties and the atmosphere around screwed hunahpu farmyard may have actually modified Dobson brain. One such modification, being a complete wiping clean of his memory between eating a truck is the ramshackle kiosk adjacent to sawdust bridge and arrival at the gate of the owl sanctuary Three days later. Some traditionalist have had harsh words to say about Ted Kak. After all, he made his name as a young firebrand with a deliberately provocative book, arguing that Dobson was not the true author of the bilgewater elegies, and that the pamphleteer had never set foot in Willie Pegg, let alone work there as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. These were and are preposterous theories, and Kak did himself no favors with his shoddy scholarship, Cavalier approach to source material and pomposity. Yet with his Anthony Burgess, hairstyle, horn rimmed glasses and barking voice, it was a natural for television cat shows, and even the krusteaz Dobson just still speaking, or is the legendary appearance on Russell hathi Plus, TV critic loopy seabag wrote at the time that Ted CAC with his Anthony Burgess hairstyle, homerun glasses and barking voice is the best thing I've ever seen on television. Apart from it's a knockout in his attempt to unravel what happened to Dobson on the day of his visit to the owl sanctuary, Ted Kak put himself in the pamphlet is sturdy Hungarian flying off the boat and recreated the journey. Of course, screwin who poojas much changed, the whole area around the farmyard has been flattened and there is no longer any sign of the eerie bomb, or the disturbing well, or they are below the hands, or indeed of the sanctuary. in their place, stands a derelict and abandoned shopping precinct in which feral beasts and teenagers cavort and Carew's. Only a branch of the plumbing trains. spigots are us remains open, and its stock is covered in dust and breadcrumbs. characteristically, Ted Kak was undeterred. He had read a lot of books about psychogeography and thought he did not really understand what he did, though he did not really understand what he read. He was determined to pretend to be the pamphleteer in that place at that time on that day, so many years ago, so much so they're prepared by eating a breakfast of bloaters and wearing a grubby pair of trousers. And just as the painter Oskar kokoschka had a life sized rag doll made two replicas to replace his last love amatola Ted Kak created a simulacrum of marigold to using string and wall and scrunched up dish cloth and waved it goodbye as he crashed out of the door on his way to sawdust bridge. The crucial paragraph in his research paper is this. There I stood, he wrote in a puddle outside of the boarded up milk bar where once had stood the gate of the screen hunahpu owl sanctuary. I had absolutely no idea how I got here. It was as if my brain had been modified in some sinister way and my memory wiped clean. This leads me to the irrefutable conclusion that exactly the same thing happened to Dobson and that is why he never wrote about his perilous journey in his pamphlet meetings with remarkable owls out of print. What I do not yet know is how permanent this brain modification will prove to be God help me. I cannot see any holes in this argument whatsoever. So I'm prepared to state that Ted Kak pompous and irritating as he may be a solved one of the enduring mysteries of the pamphleteers career.

As for the pamphlet itself, as I said, it's a curious work trudging through the owl sanctuary. Dobson from time to time comes across an owl perched upon the branch of a tree, the attempt first to describe it, and this is where his lack of all of the all of her logical knowledge lets him down. Each description consists almost entirely of the word head, beak, wings, big round eyes, talons, and hooting sound in various combinations. But it's the second part of each meeting to which we turn wherein Dobson tries to, as he puts it, commune with the owls. He hits them, He flaps his arms as if their wings he pounces upon a squirrel or field mouse on savages eight and swallows it. He hoots again. I am Dobson he writes, and for day, and for today, at least, I am become an owl is I think, not the owls which are remarkable in this instance, but Dobson himself. And I'm gonna see if we can bring up some theme music now. I don't know whether we'll be able to or not.

Given this is the Science Museum, it seems appropriate that I should read something about science. And so I remembered to bring with me to the Science Museum. A fantastic book that I bought a long time listeners will know this. It's a little a five, a five or a three, a five book with a yellow cover spineless, called further science book 20. And it was written and published by Norman Davis in 2001. And that's all I know about it. Other than the fact that in the back, it's inscribed to Jenny Mary. Candace regard. Norman Davis. I'm wondering if that's Jenny Mary who presents women's our if Sophie proves herself to be a very ungrateful person, because further science book 20 is one of the great books of our time. And I just wish I had books one to 19. To give you some idea of why this is such a fantastic book. I'm going to read you a couple of excerpts from further science book 20 by Norman Davis. Dogs one that the fact that C centuries old wood when broken is fresh orange and turns gray in 40 seconds then Black is significant too. It means that carbon color is air linked anaerobic three and that although carbonizing process without air contains color as it were, gets behind, it rapidly catches up in air for and it also means that dogs being colorblind and insect not that dog brains are opposite to insect etc. fish, birds and man regarding brain oxygen five which points to fundamental opposite division of organic brains into aerobic and anaerobic possibly also explaining color blindness, etc. That's not all Norman Davis has to say about dogs he has an entire separate passage about dog psychology. One that pro alcohol dogs jack Russell terriers Swiss mountain dog are impure work a dog as a man to nice quality dogs, Shetland, Golden Retriever, Tibetan Corgi etc. are isolated island, small dogs at sea level.

That's all for me for this week. Bye bye
