This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air, a program in which I babble Pros for about half an hour. produced as ever by Johnny seven, who is wearing headphones and mucking about with some sort of disc anyway, but he makes sure that you hear it. And there's a theme to the show this week which will become apparent to astute listeners, or even honesty once it's fairly obvious. But anyway, there is a theme this week begins with quite a long sentence. A mad old farmer frack was vexed and not on account of his cows as would normally be the cause of his vexation phase, cows were unusually contented in their field, cooing and munching in balmy weather, contented perhaps, because they were not being driven relentlessly from field to field, through gate after gate by the Mad old farmer for no apparent purpose, as was his habit. Come rain or shine through the rain was much more common than shine in that part of the world. Where old farmer frac had his farm, ei ei, oh, no. For once the cows were being left to go about their Khadi business undisturbed. For old farmer frac, had other things on his mind on these mad old mind, things that kept him from attending to his cows. And what was vexing him on this Mary Mae morning, with seething envy, envy of his neighboring farmers, whose names we know not but whose farms gloried in their scarecrows, fantastic constructions of sticks and straw and high an old rags and abandoned hat. And what have you serried ranks of them scattered here and there across the field, frightening any crows that might ponder landing for Packard or growing crop? frightening children to those traipsing across the field to or from the village school or post office? Who could imagine the scarecrows springing to life uttering rustic curses and abracadabra is causing birds to topple dead from the sky, and trees to wither and die? Will such mystery faces amuse them to Reek out there in the country where civilization is held at bay, and weird and wild spirits are abroad in the land? None weirder nor Wilder, some say, than the innards of old Mad, Mad old farmer fracks head, the likes of which is the stuff of nightmares to city folk, the innards of that head atop the creaking frame that is leaning on one of his farm fences this may morning, his mad eyes gleaming as he surveys the neighbor's field, and then numberless scarecrows, the cause of his vexations, for he has not a single scarecrow on his field, having been banned from keeping one by the rustic authorities on trumped up charges, got it put about by the other farmers, terrible tales of cruelty and vise and debauchery, about which he was given no opportunity to defend himself. Before the ruling was laid down at a conclave in a bomb on a thunder booming evening. And ever since he has seen his fields beset by impertinent crows, unafraid to swoop and it is this that vexes him on every day God brings until he is at his wits end, leaning on the fence, boots imbedded in a puddle, gazing at the scarecrows. When all of a sudden within the weird and wild in his head. There is sparked a snap, and he has a bright idea.

It is many long years since mad old farmer frac provided a service to the woman he knew only as posty. The woman who presided over the village post office, in his befuddled old head, he cannot recall exactly what it was he did for her. If he concentrate hard, he recalled something about her asking him for a hen to be ritually sacrificed. End trials scattered on the post office floor and the signs read. She seemed well satisfied with the signs. Whatever they were, for they foretold that one day in the future, she would leave the village post office behind and be known as international woman of mystery Primrose dent, and low it came to pass, and alfama frac still had scratched on the wall of his bomb, her metal Tapping Machine number, she gave it to him, she said, in case he ever needed to call in a favor. He had given her a hand at the necessary time, she could not promise him a hand in return. And in any case, that would be foolish. A farmer in need of a new hen would not obtain one from an international woman of mystery, would he? But if he had a request commensurate with her powers, and status and fantastic mystery, he should not hesitate to contact her. old farmer frac thumps his forehead repeatedly on a fence post in or at his own stupidity. Why did he not think of calling her before he turns his back on his neighbor, scarecrows, and trudges off to the bomb? Hello, is that international woman of mystery Primrose dent? Speaking? This is old farmer frack. Ah, my sacrificial hen provider after all these years, how are you? I am sorely vexed. Tusk Tusk, and you are calling in a favor and asking me to undo your vexation. That's about the size of it. Yes. How may I help you, you mad old farmer you. I want to talk to you about robots. The Merry month of May has come and gone. It is now September. Throughout the summer months, there was much hammering and pounding and sawing and banging and grinding and cranking in the sinister subterranean headquarters somewhere underneath the Alps, where international woman of mystery Primrose dent holds sway. At the end of August, a fleet of container lorries set out along the winding mountain roads, ferrying their cargo to mad old farmer frack far away. Now, as he wakes up in the morning, and comes out to Bama with his cows, he gazes up at the sky, and sees crows masses of them all too fearful to come swooping down upon his field. Yet there is still not a scarecrow to be seen anywhere on his farm. Instead, far more terrifying to crows than his neighbor's constructions of sticks and straw and hay and old rags and abandoned hats and what have you. Plotting across madal farmer fracks field, a thousands upon thousands of robots, big and clunky and clunking and clanking and magnetic lights flashing and buzzes buzzing, pitiless automatons, whose computerized brains are programmed with the single instruction. exterminate crows.

That was a story about Matt alfama frac. This isn't the creation of the first fully operational sand robot is a title of Maverick science and unparalleled seaside resort ingenuity, for it was a maverick scientist on holiday at a seaside resort, who conceived the idea of the sand robot and built one and made it work. As always with stupendous scientific initiatives, there were many false starts and hiccups along the way. From the first glimmer of the idea within the maverick brain pans of ignatz Ed Balls to the initial wheezing, plodding, creaking steps of the prototype sand robot, entire days past in witless, tinkering and frustration, and sometimes Yes, despair. But in spite of all he never gave up on it last a fortnight after the spark of inspiration, the world first sand robot took it first steps across the drizzling sands of dilapidation on sea. There was metal in ignatz Ed Balls his past, nor indeed his present, which would have prepared the world for his matchless achievement. Those holidaymakers whose drawers dropped open as they watch the sand robot bearing down upon them upon the beach, could never have guessed that its creator was a lowly janitor at a mop factory. nor would they realize that it was only by accident that he had come to the seaside resort in the first place. Given two weeks furlough by his overseer ignatz Ed Balls, packed a suitcase and headed for the railway station, intending to go to somewhere with mountains and snow and goats, famous temperamentally attuned to mountains and snow and goats. As it happened, he was faithfully distracted by the Hoot of an owl in the rafters of the railway station, and boarded the wrong train. Class it was he found himself in dilapidation on See, there were no mountains, no snow, and no goats. He was inappropriately dressed, and he was terrified of the sea. And so having booked a room in an insalubrious guest house, and sat on the hard bed and sobbed, is someone from within the deepest core of his being a reserve of manly grit, and headed down to the beach, and lay upon the sand and smoked his pipe. In all the years he had been mopping the corridors of the mock factory ignatz A balls had been turning over in his mind various ideas for creating an automaton. This was let's just remind ourselves, the 1950s and automata were for most people, the stuff of science fiction, ignited balls was not an aficionado of the genre. But his visions of the robot he would build fell in with the conventions of the time, it would be a humanoid shape, and kanki and it would work and crank and plod and possibly have some flashing lights and buzzers. In other words, it would only vaguely resemble with sand robot he actually made. He sat on the beach smoking his pipe, his back turned to the terrifying sea, and he picked up handfuls of sand and let them fall through his fingers. As an amateur scientist, he knew that sand could be turned into glass, however unlikely that seemed to the dim witted brain. And it was as he considered the unlikelihood that this stuff falling through his fingers could be turned into something solid and flattened see through that he wondered if it could also be turned into something of humanoid shape that word and clamped and plotted and could even be imbued with primitive intelligence. And so the spark was lit. The history of scientific achievement is littered with happy accidents.

We have already seen how ignites Ed Balls was only sitting surrounded by sand. Because of the Hoot of an owl. It would be splendid to be able to say that it was another Hoot of another hour. That set in crane, the creation of the world's first sound robot, but it was not. Rather it was the shrieking of dolls. It was this ungodly din that made Ed Balls look around towards the sea, he failed so and to note, as he had never noted before, that sand when wet becomes impacted, and while wet, solid is keen scientific brain instantly realized that if an adhesive agent were added to the sand while it was wet, it could remain solid when it dried. leaping up from the beach, he scampered into the streets of dilapidation on sea in search of such an adhesive. And here, there was a second, the accident in his excitement running pell mell ignatz Ed Balls collided with a seaside resort Hawker. An egg man selling eggs by the by his vanbrugh clicking. One egg fell to the ground and smashed upon the paving and ignatz Ed Balls stepped into the eggs spilled in it. He paid the Hawker for the breakage, then sat on a seaside resort bench to wipe the egg goo from the soul of his boat. And then he saw in a flash that it was sufficiently viscous to act as an adhesive, the adhesive that could bind wet sand the wet sand which he would mold into the frame of a robot. The rest is history. ignatz Ed Balls chased after the Hawker and bought all his remaining vanbrugh chicken eggs. Then he returned to the beach, fearful of approaching too close to the awful sea. He commanded the services of a sandcastle building taught to fetch pile after pile of wet impacted sand from the shoreline. Slowly over the following fortnight, he molded the sand fortified with egg owlbear men into a humanoid shape. nine feet tall. When it was done, he inserted various bits of wiring and magnets and resonators and fashion the control panel small enough to be worn on the wrist similar to the ones sported by General jumbo to control his barmy army of miniature soldiers and sailors and airmen. In the comic strip you will recall from days gone by. We must be thankful that ignatz Ed Balls never managed to build an army of sand robots. His prototype proved to be an automaton of awesome destructive power, within seconds of stirring into artificial life, as it plotted across the bright sands of the beach dilapidation on see the strange Sandy sign apps isn't it strange, Sandy artificial brain, snapped into artificial yet malevolent life, and it went on the rampage. It was a slow, plodding rampage, but a rampage nevertheless, as hordes of screaming terrified holidaymakers later attested, ignites egg balls fast frantically with the control panel on his wrist, trying to hold his creation in its tracks. His efforts were in vain. At the last he was alone up on the beach with his sand robot, the holiday makers having fled as the sun dipped below the horizon. horrified observers on the promenade watched as the huge implacable, malevolent sand robot pursued its creator, into the cold, pitiless sea, the sea that always terrified him and now engulfed him as he sank beneath the waves. And his sand robot, lethal and relentless followed him and crumbled and was dispersed upon the waters of the earth.

The next piece is called another sandcastle but a different robot. And it was prompted, so it sort of has some relation to the previous piece, but it was written in fact for the the dabbler website after the appearance excuse me of a piece by Daniel Calder called a sandcastle and robot and Well, let me tell you they were just three words. But when I read them on Monday, a childhood memory came flooding back in vivid detail. Sand Castle and robot wrote Daniel Calder, sand castle and robot, sand castle and robot. All of a sudden I was six years old. We were on holiday at the seaside on funny soil applied. There is a reason why I lapsed into French. For I remember as if it were yesterday, planting a paper flag atop the highest point of my admittedly cack handed sandcastle. When emerging from the sea, onto the sand, there came a robot. It was huge, whirring and clanking like a robot in a 1950s B movie. It was plodding relentlessly towards my sandcastle, and it was a French robot. I knew it was French, because within it, sorry, I knew it was French because when it came and stamped my sandcastle flat under its thumping magnetic feet, it made a grating metallic noise of unmistakable Gallic contempt. Small and spindly. I sprang at it and beat my tiny fists against it hard, shiny panels. I bruised my knuckles on a rivet and burst into tears. The robot cranked onwards towards an ice cream kiosk. The sun was shining and the waves washed against the sand. I sat with ping and trembling my morning's work on done by a big French metal automaton. The joys of my childhood holiday lay in tatters, never to be regained. I had learned a hard lesson. Curiously, no one else in my family witnessed this tragedy. Neither my papa nor my mama, nor my siblings, no my aunts and uncles nor the dozens of cousins there were with us that day had any idea what I was babbling on about as I wait wild my tale of Whoa. They claimed I must have been daydreaming urgently with a quivering rivet bruised hand I pointed towards the ice cream kiosk over on the promenade near the bandstand in the pavilion. But the French robot had already passed on cracking a choc ice from the kiosk in its big metal hand, making its implacable progress into the town and beyond, onto the downs to heroin Ravage everything in its path. The following day, my game of crazy golf was disrupted by a giant plodding, worrying, clanking Belgian robot, but I cannot quite recall how that panned out.

That was today's theme, sand, sand robots, sand and robots or sand castles and robots or robots and scarecrows. And I thought we would conclude today's program with a selection of excerpts from my book, Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives, which is available, possibly still available in bookshops? Certainly available online published by constable and if you want to buy that it's a nonfiction book, obviously. But if you want to buy fiction books by Mr key, go to the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org and there are several paperbacks collecting stories I've read on this program. So I thoroughly recommend you purchasing as many books as possible. But anyway, let's let's have some selections. We can we can just take a random random selections from the letter M.

The Messiah of devil died, a French Messiah sixth century. Gregory of tools in his Chronicles relates to the story of a man who was driven insane by flies in a forest near are. Two years later, in 591. He appeared in Jebel Dan, dressed in animal pelts, and announcing he was Christ. He soon had an army of 1000 followers and sent naked somersaulting emissaries to Bishop oremus. In lippie, the bishop perceived the devil at work. When the Messiah arrived, the bishops henchmen dragged him to the ground and stabbed him to death. Some 12 centuries later, General dam was overrun by packs of man eating wolf like creatures, but that may be coincidental.

And finally, Marianne Moore the American poet 1887 to 1972 the ford motor company hired Marianne Moore to devise names for their cars. She suggested mongoose, civic, resilient bullet, silver sword, varsity stroke, pastel gram and Dante con moto and utopian turtle top. None of these were used, and the company decided to call where new car be and sell. And that's the end of this week's show. I hope you enjoyed it. I won't be here next week. I will be elsewhere. But I'll be back in two weeks. Bye bye.
