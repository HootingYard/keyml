Good evening. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. This week's show is various pips squeezed out of the archive or something like that. Yes, voluminous hooting out archive. With all of which you can thousands upon thousands of words that you can read at WWW dot hooting yard.org. When I turn my mind to the great sprint champions of the past, as I often do, I often think of Bob Lutz tavole. He came from the terminal and he was such a fast runner that it was said he could outrun an express train, which was a strange thing to say, for that time, there were no trains, express or otherwise in the terminal. But of course, Bob net of all was famous throughout the world and he often raced in foreign countries, so it's conceivable that he was tempted on one of his travels to compete against a railway train. His trainer was cranky, old Hattab, who himself had been a very great sprinter. Making his champion run in front of rather than alongside a speeding train is exactly the kind of technique old hallowed would have used. Once it is said he made Bob knit tavole run an uphill double marathon wearing an iron vest twice in one day. One has only to consider the records broken by Bob net to voltar recognize him for the superb sprinter he was leafing through old athletics almanacs, his name appears again and again and again. Invariably in capital letters annotated by one, two, or even three stars at the top of every list. They say he had to rent a warehouse to store all his cups and shields and trophies, to think that he had won all the major Tyrolean sporting events before he was 20 years old. Is to gasp in wonder. Could he have succeeded without old Howard. They made a striking pair the Whippets like Rama with his mop of golden hair and the wheezing elderly man who smoked four packets of black a new rolling tobacco every day, dressed always in his Stalinist cardigan, a stopwatch unique pocket, leaning on a stick he claimed to have broken off the tree of heaven. If I shut my eyes I see them still. My father and his mentor Bob needs to evolve and old Howard heroic figures from a past I've had to invent a new for none of it is true.

I received an email from Octavia funnel, who wrote Dear Mr. Key, I'm sure I read somewhere that Dobson's companion and a man uncle marigold, too, was a feral child like the wild boy of Abbe wrong, or Kaspar Hauser. Is this true? Before I go on, to say that I've never been entirely sure about the correct pronunciation of the word feral. Is it feral, or feral? I kind of prefer feral but it's probably feral. Anyway, I think I can help Miss funnel out here. She's clearly unfamiliar with Dobson's rare and out of print pamphlet 10 things guaranteed to drive marigold, true crackers, and amusing Bagatelle which we wrote for marigolds birthday one year. It's worth quoting at some length. There can be no doubt about number one on the list of things that drive marigold Choo crackers. Countless of the times I've witnessed her seething with fury when she's mistaken for Mary gold true, the so called savage infant of splat. splat is a tiny stricken village in Cornwall, and it was here on a muggy summer's day, sometime in the last century, that a peasant pushing his Barrow of countryside filth along a line was astonished to encounter a small child roaring and spitting and grouting and scrambling in the muck. Its gender was indeterminate, but its savagery was unquestioned But the peasant sad to say, had the morals of the gutter and a heart as foul as a swamp. And he decided then and there to sell a child to a traveling circus or a zoo. plucking the child from it ditch, he shoved her onto his Barrow and trundle off towards a larger town, where mounted banks were known to gather. But the child bestie or being that she was sank her teeth into the peasants wrist and attacked him in a whirling frenzy of bloodlust. She ignored the hair off his head. She was knowing the hair off his head, when a kindly doctor arrived on the scene. he patted her on the head and announced their their little one, Be not afraid. I am a kindly doctor, fascinated by natural philosophy, and I shall take you to my comfortable house and see if over a period of months or years I can still in you the instill in you the civilized qualities that were your birthright, but have been stolen from you by no doubt, tragic circumstances. What is your name? tiny one? The child how old and how old and how old? Ah. Said the kindly doctor. You are inarticulate. That noise you made sounded to me like a combination of a wolf and a bear with perhaps a touch of corncrake I deduce that you have been raised since you were a baby by wolves and bears and corncrakes and may have by bees and Hornets to still you must have a name child. So I shall call you Mary. Dr. Gold true, took the child by the hand and led her to his house, which stood all alone in a field outside splat. There he dunked her in a disinfectant bath, dressed her in girly clothes and embarked on a comprehensive pedagogical regime. Over the following weeks, he attempted to teach her metaphysics, arithmetic, rhetoric, logic, Latin Greek bread, baking, botany, chemistry, religious instruction, conspiracy theory, merchant banking, astronomy, philology, and the rudiments of table tennis. During this time, reporters from the splat Korea and bugle camped out on his doorstep, filing a series of woefully inaccurate stories about the girl they called the savage infant of splat. Her fame spread throughout Europe and Dr. Gold to receive visits from some of the most distinguished intellectuals of the day, including capisco Blunkett and wubi. It was the latter who persuaded the kindly doctor to have the girl baptized by being fully submerged in the sea off the coast of Cornwall, during which baptism she nearly drowned. She entered the booming ocean a savage infant biting and squealing and howling, wrote to the doctor, and she emerged as Mary gold to a good Christian child.

This is a selective account, of course, the doctor makes no mention of the drenched and spluttering taught who is fished out of the water by a passing trawler. Nor does he admit that the good Christian child remained incorrigibly savage for the rest of her long, long life. In spite of the doctors lessons, to which you soon added physics, geology, alchemy, pole vaulting, paleontology, entomology, knitting, forensic medicine, vaccinology, Dianetics and pottery, the savage infant of splat became a savage adolescent, and in turn a savage adult. She celebrated her 26th birthday by creeping into Dr. Gold choose bedroom as he slept, and smothering him with a pillow. Thereafter, she spent her days crashing around like a wild maniac because the ones comfortable house fell into ruin about her when she died, craggy and ancient, decades later, she had learned nothing except to speak two words, the same two words that remained the extent of the wild boy of Evo Ron's vocabulary God and milk

A few weeks ago on the show, because I wrote a piece about Dirk Bogarde with a mustache in a Vaporetto. We used the adagietto for Marla's Fifth Symphony as the music instead of the Caucasian lullaby which is our normal theme tune, Caucasian lullaby by Henry Cowan slap happy and it got quite a good response from listeners. So I think in future maybe I might use Marla's a dancer yeto again sometime which we'll see not this week because I haven't got it with me. And this is called days Oh, boot polish. It was in the days Oh boot polish that I was banished from the palace. I had done nothing wrong. But one Thursday morning, they came for me in my cubicle and tore the paperwork from my elegant hands and told me that I was to be banished. I was led to a cupboard where I was told to deposit my pencils and my hats, and then to another cupboard where there were many, many shelves stacked oh so high with packets of nuts. They told me I could take six packets to each of peanuts and hazelnuts, one of pine nuts, and one of Brazil nuts. I was to cram them into my pockets and pack the flaps down. It was made very clear to me that my pockets would be rummaged through as I stepped outside the palace to begin my banishment. And if I had more than six packets of nuts about my person, vanished from banishment from the palace would be the least of my worries. It was not entirely clear to me what this meant. But it was not meant to be clear to me it was intended that I'd be stricken with terror and have my imagination run right at the prospect of some gruesome fate. In truth, I did not get myself into a little flap, for I have always been law abiding, and I had no intention of taking more than my allotment of nuts. I have twice mentioned flaps, material flaps and emotional flaps. And before I'm through, I may refer to other flaps we shall see. Once I have packed my pockets with my six packets of nuts and patted down the flaps, they told me to come out of the cupboard, and as soon as I was in the corridor, they slammed the cupboard door shut with such unnecessary violence that I jumped into the air for a second. The ceiling was high enough that I did not crack my head on it. I understood why they had instructed me to pack down my pocket flats because have are not done. So one or more of the packets of nuts may have fallen from my pocket during my inadvertent little jump. I got the impression waiting for their next move that they had fully expected me to jump. Around the corner of the corridor one of them now appeared wheeling a gurney, they told me to clamber onto it and to lie down on my back. And then they strapped me to it with a series of buckled woolen belts. It was explained to me that this was all part of the standard banishment procedure and that I should read nothing sinister into it. So I didn't. I felt quite relaxed, staring at the grimy yellow ceiling of the curry door as I was wheeled along, amused about the days Oh boots polish, and wondered if they were coming to an end. It was hard to tell. We arrived at a junction and turned into another corridor. This one had a ceiling that was also yellow but much less grimy. After a while my Gurney gathered to a stop, I was unbuckled. And they told me to get off of it and stand up. I did as I was told and saw that I was in a part of the palace that I'd never seen before. But this didn't surprise me, for I always knew that I was kept to only certain areas of what must have been a tremendously large building. Now I was going to be thrown out of it all together with six packets of nuts to see me on my way. I did find this all very curious, but they showed no sign of giving me any explanation. So I kept my mouth shut. There was a cold rush of air to my left and I looked around and saw that a sliding door had switched open and beyond it was open air, a field, some shriveled vegetation, distant cows and a magnificent blue sky. I had not seen the likes in before the days Oh boot polish and for The first time since they rejected me for my cubicle, I spoke. Gosh, I said one of them whacked me on the wind pipe with a tally stick and I crumpled to the floor. My patted down pocket flaps kept my six packets of nuts safe from spillage.

It took me some while to get my breath back, and then they lifted me to my feet. I heard an ungodly beeping noise. This was coming from a wall panel which formed part of the stupendously complicated palace communication system installed at the very beginnings of the days Oh boot Polish when inventions were still welcomed. I knew it ran on electricity and pneumatics but beyond that its workings were a mystery to me. The beeping turned out to be a signal confirming my banishment. They turned out my pockets, and as soon as I was satisfied that I was carrying no more than six packets of nuts, and nothing else, and was shoved in the small of the back out into the field, and the sliding door switched shut behind me. I walked away from the pallet in more or less a straight line for about an hour. Then the sky was filled suddenly, with dozens of swordfish jet planes with military markings. Dozens of planes skidding and swooping making a terrible den. I clapped my elegant hands over my equally elegant is to stifle the racket without much success. While I was standing there being a bit weedy, one of the planes came into land about 50 segments away and discord, a troupe of howler monkeys, who immediately came charging towards me howling and howling, like grabbed my arms and legs, lifted me off my feet, bundled me into a tarpaulin and carried me off towards the plane. I noticed a solitary styling in the blue sky. Once inside the plane, which took off again as soon as I had been ferried aboard, I was tossed from the tarpaulin onto a surprisingly comfortable bunk and injected with a serum. This gave me a splitting headache, but also caused me to begin babbling in urgent and breathless gulping sobs. Everything I knew about the palace and the days Oh, boot polish. I couldn't stop myself. Even when one of the howler monkeys passed me a tumbler of refreshing milkshake. I ended up spitting most of it onto the floor. so desperate was I to tell everything I could dredge up from the deepest nooks of my brain. It was all quite involuntary. None of the howler monkeys were taking notes. In fact, they didn't seem particularly interested in what I had to tell. I prattle on for at least a day, if not more, before falling back on the bunk completely spent. They gave me some more milkshake, and this time I drained my tumbler with lipsmacking relish. Then I fell asleep. That was last week. This week, the howler monkeys have asked me to help them to make a scale model of the palace out of corrugated cardboard. I will give them what help I can. I've already given them the six packets of nuts that were the tokens of my banishment. The days Oh boot Polish are over now long lost, and I for one will not miss them. I have enough on my plate, ushering in the days Oh cellophane to a colony of 100,000 howler monkeys, learning to how just like them, but perhaps with a touch more elegance. Technology a group band

Excuse me. For a brief period in the middle of the last century, the phrase two men in a boat trip off the tongue as easily as the more familiar Three Men in a Boat of Jerome k drones comic novel. It was a very brief period, no more than a fortnight. But during that time, the whole world was abuzz with basil and guidos kropotkin fan Farah Renard unusually for a dance routine in price of a totemic anarchist performed on a rowing boat to the accompaniment of a shore bound orchestra, dance band lightshow, perfumes and fireworks, it captured the popular mood. Thousands of people, some say millions trek to the lake near Bhadra Spinney to witness the spectacle during its two week run, and basil and ghido became overnight celebrities formed over in what with retrospect, was an outbreak of mass hysteria. Within days of the final performance, during which an orphan child in the audience became overexcited and was clocked on the head with an oar. The whole thing was forgotten. trudging around the lake today, it's hard to picture the ecstatic scenes that took place here 50 years ago, there are no longer any boats to be seen, and the lake itself is surrounded by a tall electrified security fence. It is said that monstrous aquatic beings with flippers and tendrils swim and rise below the surface, or that the water is poisoned, or even that the lake is haunted by the shade of that orphaned child. Though Shani suffered a mild concussion and lived long after the incident. These are just stories believed only by the credulous, but what is beyond doubt and readily apparent to anyone who wanders there, as I do, is that the lake is dead, choked by weeds choked beyond hope. It was so different on the bright summer afternoon in 1951, when basil and ghido disembarked from their hired sharer bank and stood hand in hand wrapped in wonder, before laying out their picnic rug by the Getty, freshly graduated from Dr. Blodgett terpsichorean Academy for keen young chaps, the ill matched Judo we're touring the land, seeking a lake, pond or other body of water on which to stage their kropotkin fanfare and odd the spark of the idea came from ghido Dino's brain was thick with Bible learning, but he held the Russian anarchist Peter kropotkin 1842 to 1921 in high esteem, having fallen under his spell after reading a translated copy of research on the ice age, an article kropotkin published in notices of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in 1876. Thereafter, impressionable young ghido devoured everything by the Russian he could lay his hands on. When Blodgett demanded that his students choose a subject to interpret via the medium of dance ghido was already decided. Basil roped in as collaborator was initially reluctant until shown a photograph of kropotkin, whose beard thrilled him as no doubt it would thrill anyone who has the slightest interest in majestic 19th century facial hair. It was basil who brought to their partnership the rowing boat element, possibly because he misunderstood Blodgett instructions. Basil was by no means stupid, but it was the torturously in attentive. We should be glad it was so for who can imagine the kropotkin fanfare not taking place on dry land. By confining the dance to the limited space afforded by a rowing boat. Basil forced himself and ghido to find radical solutions to seemingly intractable Korea graphical problems. Ideal as it was as a stage upon which to show Chris Hopkins periods of imprisonment in the Peter and Paul fortress in St. Petersburg, and then later in France. The rowing boat had to be wholly reimagined when the dance addressed the anarchists field trips to Finnish and Swedish classes. Basil and ghido succeeded triumphantly.

A fan foreign art can be defined as an Austin State ostentatious display. It certainly was. There was the rowing boat on the lake with the two dancers aboard pirouetting, jumping about striking poses and of course rowing. While on the shore, a full orchestra supplemented by a dance band with a slick crooner played what can only be described as very frightening music. guidos parents, meanwhile, were scampering around operating the light show in the complex piping system that sent jets of exotic perfumes wafting over the crowds. And yet, and yet, what ought to have been the beginning of a whole new strand of rowing boat based dance extravaganzas with basil and ghido. The pioneers and masters of the form was in the end, just a flash in the pan. Though they had sold enough tickets to keep the prokop kropotkin fanfare not running well beyond its two week run. By just spinny bylaws meant that it had to end. In any event. ghido now fell victim to the jangles and was carted off to the mysterious clinic hewn into an inaccessible mountainside. And basil became a bus conductor. They never worked together again.

Just a couple of things to catch up on. One as I mentioned, Jerome K. Jerome, three author of Three Men in a Boat. his middle name for those of you who don't know was clap cut, kl APKA. Jerome clapper CO, Jerome, very sensible name. And also, when the piece I opened with a piece about the fictional athlete Bob needs to evolve. And when that piece first appeared on the hooting yard website, I received a letter from a reader named E. duggleby, who wrote, dear Frank, until I read the piece entitled, a snapshot from the history of athletics. I had no idea that the fictional sprinter Bob needs to evolve was your father. You will probably be interested to know that some years ago, when my collection of memorabilia related to this great invented athletes threatened to swamp my modest living quarters, I opened the world's first fictional athlete Bob net tivol Museum. My collection includes the following items. His bus pass is iron vest, a lithograph of one of his ears, the tentacles of a squid he admired old halabi cotton wool bag, several urgent telegraphic messages relating to the 1952 Helsinki disturbances. A plasticine model of an apple call with Bob net to evolve teeth marks clearly delineated. A jog a pot, a basin, lavish Petunia strewn flooring from a podium up rooted from the soil of an incredible sporting arena described in the novel, fictional athlete Bob Nick devala, the rotating things from Planet glubb silhouettes of Bob Nick to volt old halb and Christopher Plummer, oh rags, a bottle of gripe water, splendid tungsten pincers, the hat of a gondolier and a red fez from looks or a pincushion, turpentine, Norwegian wall and map with blots and 10 recordings of the shipping forecast acoustically treated by one of the leading Dutch music pioneers of the 20th century. If you all your listeners would like to visit the fictional athlete Bob net to vol museum. Please be aware that it is virtually inaccessible to normal folk, being located in an ice girt wasteland beset by howling gales ticket prices available upon request. And that's the end of this week's show. Apart from a quotation from dream Thorpe by Alexander Smith, where he writes about a consumptive Shoemaker I went to visit a consumptive Shoemaker seated here I can single out his very house, namely the very window of the room in which he is lying on that straw roof might The Raven alight and flap his sable wings? there at this moment is the suit preme tragedy being enacted. A woman is weeping there, and little children are looking on with a sore bewilderment before nightfall the poor peeked face of the bowed artists and will have gathered it's inevitable Peace, and the widow will be led away from the bedside by the tenderness of neighbors and the cries of the orphan brood will be stilled, and yet this present in do biteable suffering and loss does not touch me like the sorrow of the woman of the ballad. The Phantom probably have a minstrels brain. The Shoemaker will be forgotten, I shall be forgotten. And on that happy note, that's the end of this week's hooting out on the air. back next week. Bye bye for now.
