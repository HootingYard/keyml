It's very the leak today.

Frank Key  00:31
Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. Welcome to half an hour of Wittering and Babel, otherwise known as hunting yard on the air. We meet Frank key, ably assisted by pansy cradle Joe who is currently doing live crochet, as opposed to live knitting, or actually maybe reading something as well later. We'll have to see how we go for time. Time once upon a time. Once upon a time, I was scrambling down the lower reaches of mountainside through shingle and scrambles. Right let's begin again. This is hooting out on the air. I'm going to read you some stories. Here is the first story which I will now attempt not to screw up within the first half sentence. live radio for you. Once upon a time, I was scrambling down the lower reaches of a mountainside through shingleton scumble and Bracken when I chanced upon a tosspot bivouac. It was a surprisingly well made bivouac using branches from large and beach and believe it or not, and sycamore trees to form a roof upon which sufficient foliage had been impacted to provide Sterling shelter from hail storms and tempests. Although the weather was in fact spectacularly, Clement Clement two was the name of the tosspot. As I soon learned, for I immediately struck up a conversation with him, as is my habit when I encounter mountainside people. I learned that he had taken to his bivouac after fleeing, fleeing from what I asked, but he seemed reluctant to tell me someone with a less acute insight into human nature than I might have put this down to coyness. But I spent many years studying under Draghi and Dempster. So I knew there was more than simple shyness behind his diffident mutterings, and determined to Winkle the full story out of him. So I grabbed the top spot around the neck with one of my huge bear like hands, lifted him off his feet and shock my other huge bear like hand made into a fist in front of his face, as Dempster taught by a Kooning one's fist shaking to a very precise rhythm. The half strangled subject is quickly placed in what Draghi termed the confessional brain zone, akin to having been injected with a truth serum. As I suggested, it took years of training to perfect the technique, and I'm afraid a large number of fully strangled hamsters and Stokes lie buried in the grounds of the Institute. Five minutes later, I was fully apprised of the reasons why the tosspot had fled his mountainside bivouac. He had been employed as an extra in a heist film set on a submarine. Sterling Hayden may have been involved in the production, but this was not entirely clear. What came shining through the toss pots account, however, was the claustrophobic atmosphere on the set, which was actually a real decommissioned submarine. The tenebrous leaking interior had been slightly refurbished to include heist movie essentials, like an intricate security system, and a safe full of gold bullion, but otherwise it remained cramped on halt and riddled with clanking machinery. After six days filming, during which time he had to learn lien against a damaged pump looking more than the tosspot had cracked, tearing off his sub mariners green tunic and cap. He stumbled out of the submarine swam to the surface of the tank in which it was docked, scrambled up a ladder to the studio canteen, and fled until he reached the mountainside where with unaccustomed competence, he constructed his bivouac. Using already fallen branches from Lark and beach and believe it or not, and sycamore trees and the foliage there of where I bumped into him as I scrambled down from the mountain peak upon which I had been making an invaluable study of the nesting habit of the mountain locked with.

Frank Key  05:22
Vita I was to discover that the continuity person on the film set distraught at the vanishing of Clement the tosspot and unable to find anyone have a similar physiognomy to lean against the damage pump, advise the producer to abandon the project. It remained unclear whether this producer was Sterling Hayden, or possibly human Cronin. Either way, the film was never finished, I put down the tosspot and gave him a look of reproach and then I carried on down the mountainside in sadness and sorrow. I had hoped to bring you the script of the heist on a submarine film, referred to above but alas, my plans were dashed. The film as you know, was never made, but it's ghost remains a fascinating exercise in the submarine based heist genre. Although from my close reading of the extant screenplay, it seems that the entire drama is confined to the interior of the submarine, and thus, the viewer hardly sees the sea. But compaction of the narrative with the merits the compaction of the maritime with the criminal has always held me in something like but not quite. Or is it perhaps the contrast between the vastness of the broiling oceans and the small minded pettiness of much behavior out with the law, or the admixture of sense that salt Tang of the sea mingled with cordite a hoodlum aboard a boat in habits are not terribly different register to a gun, sir, in an urban alleyway. I think if one can be said to inhabit a register, for the time being, it can be said because I just said it. And believe me, I know what I'm talking about when it comes to the sea and crime. Many people, particularly tinies are intrigued by pirates. And that is a particular romantic vision of piracy. That is called the mind when we think of marine criminality. For me, however, there is no such viewer. My interest is rather in the trench coat, Fedora and sneer type of law breaker propelled into a sci fi setting in a dingy battered by waves to say, or pacing below decks on a tramp steamer, or even forced to take the wheel of a tugboat when its Skipper is felled by food poisoning. So a heist set on a submarine was always bound to appeal to me. Indeed, I'm surprised that I was not called on. If not to write the screenplay, then at least to act as a consultant. I'm sure I would have been able to provide valuable insights. I'm not myself a criminal, and nor interestingly, have I ever been to see in any significant sense? Oh, I've paddled in it with my trousers rolled up in my boots and socks placed carefully on the pebbles. True enough more than once. But I have never been to see in the sense that say Joseph Conrad, or Herman Melville went to see yes, I feel that have the producers of the abandoned submarine heist movie employed me, the film may yet have been made. I would, for example, have been able to give them quite a few tips about pumps. Authenticity is important when filming a submarine drama. Whether or not it has an element of crime, and getting the pumps right can make or break success at the box office. If I'm not a sea dog, nor a criminal, I certainly know my pumps. Though I am unable to read out the screenplay here as I'd hoped to do. I have read it. And it's signally lacking in submarine pump authenticity. The tosspot used as an extra you will remember was to spend much of the film leaning against a pump looking more than I do not quarrel with that, per se tosspot sailors often have to lean against pumps in submarines. Whether or not a heist is in imminent. When they sign up, they know that's one of the things they may be called upon to do, along with the carrying of pails, the ringing of bells and the polishing of the periscope with a rag. Never underestimate the importance of rags on submarines by the way.

Frank Key  09:54
rags, pumps, the sea and crime. Those are my areas of hard earned expertise. I learned what little I know in the School of ragam pumps in the sea and crime. That is to say in every day unlettered, learning in the town square of a foul and vinegary seaside resort and the torrential rain listening wrapped to shore bound submariners, who'd polished many a periscope with many IRag in their time. their testimony is often overlooked in our universities and think tanks. More's the pity.

Frank Key  11:00
Blodgett decided he wanted to leave in a Schloss. So he did the sensible thing and went to an estate agent who specialized in short says or short Awesome. Well, I'm looking for Blodgett demanded it is demanding wait. It's somewhere bleak and forbidding and unacceptable except by a vertiginous and unreliable funicular or gondola lift?

Frank Key  11:34
Yes, if you've seen the film where Eagles dare directed by Brian De Hutton and released in 1968, you will have a good idea of what I'm talking about. Oh, estate agent. That is not a film I have seen, replied the estate agent, an impossibly youthful and pimply person who was terrified of Blodgett for reasons he was there yet only dimly aware of. I'm not much of a cinema girl at all, he continued.

Frank Key  12:08
For I prefer to spend my leisure hours at the circus, one with ventriloquist. Blodgett had strong views on circuses and ventriloquist but so intent was he on reviewing at least a couple of slots and with a view to purchasing one of them. So they decided not to be right to the estate agent just yet. A pox upon circuses and upon ventriloquists was all he said, and then he asked the pimply person if there were any suitable flotsam on his books, at which point he was handed a big fat leather bound flotsam brochure and invited to thumb through it, which he did for about 15 minutes, occasionally making strange explosive noises and thumping his fist on the estate agents desk. Outside birds landed on the branch of a tree and began to school can sing. the tempo of youth was growing increasingly nervous of Blodgett, so he reached into his drawer for a can of pepper spray. He had only used it once to disable a Rafi and bent on criminality on a Wednesday morning. Now it was Wednesday morning again, and he was faced with the bad tempered giant of a man in a humbug hat and unseasonal galoshes, who was perhaps using Schloss purchase as a blind for some evil deed. Though what that deed might be, the estate agent did not yet know. In truth, Blodgett was perfectly serious in his intention to buy our Schloss. Although he had not worked out how in the name of heaven, he was going to pay for it. That was why he wanted it to be bleak and forbidding and in accessible, except via vertiginous and unreliable food hotel or gondola lift. For then, once inside for a viewing it would simply stay put and pull up his ramparts and defend himself against any bailiff's or law officers by pelting them with burning rags. It was not that he did not intend to pay the full last purchase price eventually, for at heart, it was an honest man, but he wanted to be in his Schloss while devising a money making scheme, which would allow him to pay for it. Meanwhile, as he gazed at the pages of the slot brochure, with greedy eyes, they continued to thump his fist on the desk, because that is the sort of man he was. Outside the tree on the branches of which little birds squawked and sang was being chopped down by an inept municipal tree topping man. Not only was he chopping down the wrong tree, but the direction of his chopping meant that when it fell, it fell slap bang into the Schloss, specialist. state agency and it fell, smashing the glass frontage at precisely the moment. But the pimply youth, unnerved by yet another thump of Blodgett fist upon his desk, pointed the pepper spray at Blodgett face and sprayed him. At which point also one of the thicker branches of the tree falling, landed with a mighty back upon the youth Ted, brining him into a daze. The birds had flown away to the branches of another tree, and they were squawking and singing still. Plus, it was Blodgett ended up at a clinic to have the pepper spray rinsed out of his eyes, while the estate agent lay in a bed elsewhere in the same clinic having his brain examined. It is hardly surprising then that Blodgett failed to buy a bleak and forbidding Schloss was inaccessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable food hotel or gondola lift on that Wednesday morning, loud with birdsong and squawk.

Pick a fruiting yard.

Unknown Speaker  16:57
When I was born, I am often asked what it was like to be born. For example, I may be leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece at a swish sophisticated cocktail party, when a fellow guest will approach me sometimes in a wheelchair and say, I'm told you were born. I don't suppose you'd care to tell me about that, would you? Or I may be queuing in the post office to buy a postage stamp or to win the person behind me sometimes on crutches will tap me on the shoulder and say, I could tell by looking at the back of your head that you were born. What was it like? Every so often I am asked in writing, usually in a cramped and barely legible hand. I wish I could say that I tried to give a full and Frank answer. I wish I could say I responded at least politely. But I do not. My usual tactic is to jibber likened to a monkey toss my not so golden locks what's left of them, and execute a little pair of sweat. I then removed from my blazer, pocket a crucifix, kiss it and set it on fire with my Ignite. Oh, fab lighter. As Perkins run through with a rapier, so himmelfarb, bewildered in the glomming, there are things fit only for the ears of those who dwell in Cretan town. Was it browning, who wrote about the bow of cherries some officious fool broken the orchard? There are no fools in my orchard any longer. I send them packing one by one, from Thursday through to the following Monday. Yes, even on the Lord's day, I chased a fool from my orchard by dint of borup wish me Godspeed, and count the circle of toads for board this board, and shall ever be as never be in weightlessness and parks.

Frank Key  19:21
was all about pansy.

Unknown Speaker  19:24
No idea.

Frank Key  19:26
It was about board plus one it was about. This is not about board. This is about Fritz. Fritz is hinged on his pips. Is the terrific new bestseller from pebble head. This time the paperback just gives us a thriller and gosh, it certainly makes for an exciting read. The beginning of the book though, is deceptively slow moving even doll. We learned that the eponymous hero is an emotional cripple who wallows in a screw of malignant vouch maps. He is an unattractive character. To wearing unattractive clothing, giving off an unattractive palm and living in an unattractive chalet in an unattractive seaside resort. We do not want in as we learned in chapters one and two of his grumbling and his scruffy dog and the bits and the bits of celery and spring onion forever stuck in his beard. We are repelled by his grimy bathtub and by his many stains. But then, in chapter three pebble head pulls the rabbit out of the hat, and we're off on a pell mell roller coaster ride of thrills and spills are plenty. What happens is that Fritz decides one morning to eat a piece of fruit. It is what happens one morning, what? What happens?

Unknown Speaker  21:01
What happens? What happens one morning?

Frank Key  21:04
What happens is that Fred decides one morning to eat a piece of fruit. It is a pip riddled fruit, and Fritz spit out the pips with such force that they involved in the hinge of his door. The door is ajar, the time because Fritz's scruffy dog has a llama put into the chalet garden to piss on a Briar Patch. When the dog comes back in Fritz goes to close the door, but cannot. It turns out but the pips Fritz spat across the room, or of adamantine hardness, and lodged in the hinge prevent the door from shutting. Thus begins a sequence of events that propels Fritz and his scruffy dog through a series of adventures that begins in an iron monger shop and rapidly moves on to a coat hanger factory, a sausage bakers, the undersea headquarters of a madcap swordfish person and a barn full of cows. All the while, the pips remain stuck in the hinge and the chalet door stays maddeningly ajar. Yet, as the story progresses, fret vet Fritz's vote Schmitz becomes less malignant, and his dog less scruffy. Bye by chapter 49. When we find fruit, picking bits of celery and spring onions out of his beard, and disposing of them down a hygienic chute, we are ready to forgive the grime Enos of his bathtub. It must be said that the novel is not an unalloyed success. I could have done without the excessive use of exclamation marks for example, and pebble heads PIP descriptions of deplorable I suspect, he may have copied them out of a cheap botanical gazzard here without first checking its accuracy. He has committed similar sins in the past, notably in the wet behind the ears trilogy, vast camps of which were plagiarized from the mistranslated Serbian bird seed catalog. These minor capitals aside, Fritz, his hinge on his pips, is a tremendous addition to the pebble headcanon read it with your feet up on your balcony. If you have a balcony with a bag of snacks at your side, the constant tweeting of caffeine is assailing your ears, freshly laundered socks on the washing line sprite in the wainscot book cause draped bellowing in the balmy spring breeze.

Frank Key  24:02
might be time for just one more. This is about as it's called boot bath. He washed his boots in the bath with a scrubbing brush. That's what he did. When he got mud on his boots. He took off his boots and place them on a mat and he filled the bath with boiling water. Then he plunged his boots into the bath. He put on a pair of gloves before he plunged his boots, so the flesh on his hands would not burn. When the boots were in the bath, he sprinkled soap flakes from a box on the surface of the boiling water. Then he went to fetch the scrubbing brush. The scrubbing brush was nowhere near the bath. He had to go up and down stairs to get it from it hook. There was a hole drilled in the handle of the scrubbing brush, so it could be held by the hook. The hook was fixed to the wall. It was a fixture and fitting. The scrubbing brush was not it was an appurtenance He neither knew nor cared which was a fixture and fitting and which was an appurtenance. His only concern was to get the mud off his boots. He scrubbed his boots with the scrubbing brush while we boots were submerged in the bath water to which he had added soap flakes from a box. The mud came off his boots in chunks. When the last flecks of mud had been scrubbed off his boots. He took the boots out of the bath and place them back on the map. The map was made a rubber he pulled the plug out of the plug hole in the bottom of the bath and the bath water drained away. While the water drained he took the scrubbing brush up and downstairs and put it back on it took he took off his gloves and threw them down a chute. At the bottom of the chute was a pile of other gloves, and such things as shirts and socks and tunics. Once a week, the power was swept into a hamper and taken off to be washed, but not today. He went up and downstairs to the room with the bath in it and looked at his boots on the mat until they were dry. Then he put on his boots. Just in time he heard the tutor whistle he sprinted up and downstairs and passed the place where the scrubbing brush how long it took and carried on out of the door and through the garden gate and he sprinted round and round and round the running track until a whistle tutored again. He stopped and panted and looked expectantly at the whistle tooting person. The whistle tooting person was studying his stopwatch. Oh how he hoped that this time he had sprinted round and round the running crack faster than the last time he had sprinted round and round the running crack. Then he had had mud on his boots, but now he had washed them in the boiling hot bath with a scrubbing brush and soap flakes from a box and there was no longer any mud on his boots. A nod from the whistle tooting person told him he had sprinted round and round the running crack faster than ever before. He was oh so happy.

Back from the happy sprinter. An eyewitness account of the training shedule of fictional athlete Bob next evolved under the direction of his coach, old hallowed by Dobson out of print. And I think that's the end of this week's show. There's only a couple of minutes left any news of your live crocheted pansy

Unknown Speaker  27:30
it went very very well. I got quite a bit done good. I was also going to give a shout out to tiny ended this week we were reminded at the end of a certain long running television show that young people who are small can often achieve great things and upon a boat tap to see

Frank Key  27:54
yes is often struck me that the one of the character Aria spoilers. Oh yeah. The character Arya Stark in Game of Thrones bears an uncanny resemblance I think to tiny Enid, the heroic and plucky taught, often mentioned in this program, of course, tiny Enid appeared in in the fictional form long before Arya Stark did so I think that perhaps George RR Martin or whatever his name is, I think he may have been reading hooting yard and and I thought that the tiny Enid character was one he could he could find inspiration in, I will say, anyway, I'm Frank archy. And I was joined by pansy on kreidel J. And the program was produced by Johnny are seven by
