Good evening This is resonance while I 4.4 FM www resonance fm.com. For the same kind of dab resonance to apparently, but I'm not clear how that works. My name is Frank Kay, this is hooting yard on the air. Although I've been thinking of retitling the show, because when I came in a little while ago and sat at the desk, there was a piece of an abandoned piece of velcro, little Velcro ribbon, like a wristband Velcro. And so I thought for a while of calling it the the weekly, abandoned piece of velcro show. But that's probably quite foolish. And last week, I was I miss timed things a bit. And I was partway through reading you a transcript of a lecture given by the Little Bo Peep. And so I thought we would begin this week show with a quick previously on hooting yard, and then continue. So what's happened is that Little Bo Peep has been out with her sheep one day, and she falls asleep and has a dream. And I'll I'll take up the story again. From from their way sort of story as a lecture transcript. I started awake, rubbed my eyes and saw that the sheep I was meant to be Shepherd essing were gone. My immediate hunch was that they had been abducted by a band of roaming Wagnerian dwarves I had read of of several such crimes in the daily nibelungen leader and countryside advertiser. So with the gung ho approach for which we peeps are universally admired, or if not universally then at least in and around Subodh med web shear. I hoisted my crook and marched off to the newsagent kiosk under those pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing a catch with it was not the advertise that I was looking for. It so happened that this news agent kept in stock various 17th century tract, including dragons downfall or the great idle dig up root and branch by Roger crab, a fiery flying roll by a visa cop and the neck of the Quakers broken by Ludwig Magilton. The one I wanted, obviously was the lost sheep found by Lawrence Clarkson. After a close reading of this pamphlet, I felt sure I would be able to locate my sheep and they would no longer be lost. I purchased the copy and prepared sorry I purchased a copy and repaired to a bosky Arbor to read it. I had barely digested the opening paragraph when I was set upon by a vulgar mechanic. He was a repellent and violent filthy fellow. Not unlike a Wagnerian dwarf, though considerably taller. I cried Unhand me, sir, and smashed him in the face with my shepherd as his crook, nearly breaking his jaw row betide those who messed with a peep, I added, kicking him in the head, as he lay sprawled and whimpering beneath a plum trees slender shade above us in the shining summer heaven. There was a cloud my eyes dwell long upon, it was quite white and very high above us. When I looked up, and found that it had gone just like nice sheep. In the course of bashing up the vulgar mechanic, I had inadvertently dropped my 17th century tract into a puzzle. And not just any puzzle, no sorry, but a muddy puddle. The muddy is too muddy puddles, in muddy puddles is it ever been my misfortune, in which to inadvertently drop a 17th century tract? Lawrence Clarkson's timeless sheep finding words were rendered illegible. What was a poor people to do?

It was at this point, just as I was venting my vehemence upon the Sprawl mechanic by Biffing him several more times with my crook that I heard distance bars. Now in my experience as a shepherdess, in and around seabob NET web share. This sound could mean only one thing. It meant there were sheep in the distance. like a mad thing I galumphing towards the sound of bars, and as I approached, I spotted fleeing a band of Wagnerian dwarves. It might have been the sight of me bearing down on them with my crook that caused them to scamper so swiftly away. More likely, I think, is that they had belatedly realized the unanswerable tedium occasioned by the company of sheep. It is a tedium I know well, or should I say new? Well, for the unexpected outcome of my notoriety as an inept Shepherd s who loses her sheep is that not a single farmer will no longer in trust me with his flock. First, this was a harrowing turn of events. I fell into penury and need but as my story spread and songs were sung about me so infamy and curdled into fame. I began to be invited onto television cat shows, notably an appearance on Russell hearty plus color supplement published fording profiles of me all walked removed. Now with these lecture tours, I'm raking it in, and I don't mean the sort of peasant raking but the likes of Hugh half bacon are doomed to for eternity in an eerie, ever repeating cycle of fate. No, I'm raking in the moolah Bula. And soon I hope to have saved enough to realize my childhood ambition and be the first peep in outer space last, like my sheep, but unlike them last in the stars last out here in the stars, little stars, big stars blowing through the night, and I'm lost out here in the stars.

And further, let it be known, known and digested, known and digested and regurgitated, regurgitated in the form of words, that it be known better, that in the last century, mudchute was the home of a monomaniac accurately to call Caspian Sea spangled bagamoyo mainly act is not strictly true that he had not one but two abiding obsessions. The first which is of little interest to us was his conviction that they were charged with his conviction that the tyrant of the Soviet Union was called Joseph Starling. While the heroine of Thomas Harris's The Silence of the Lambs was named Clarice Starling being bonkers spangled Bagh was unmoved by the fact that the mustachioed and heavily pockmarked dictator chose the pseudonym Man of Steel, in preference to his real name of gouache really, and that the troubled FBI rookie is a fictional character. But it was the Manchu man's belief that hen died. This is a disease of selecting poultry rather than a figure of speech, which consumed most of his energies. It would not be an exaggeration to say that spangled Bagg declared war on the makers of dictionaries, lexicons, grammars, and encyclopedias. Most of the major publishers of reference books have somewhere in their archives, a FAT file containing letters with that mudchute postmark, all written by pencil in tiny, tiny handwriting, their tone varying from mild complaint to violent menace. One example will suffice. I purchased the latest edition of your word book rights spangled bag on the 23rd of June 1989. And was surprised to see you define him dire this as a figure of speech in which two words connected by a conjunction are used to express a single notion that would normally be expressed by an adjective and a substantive, the use of two conjoined nouns instead of a noun and modifier. You then go on to list instances from the Bible, such as a mouth and wisdom in Luke 2115, and the hope and the resurrection of the dead in Act 23, six I do not take kindly to spending money on such drivel and have torn your worthless book to shreds. And I would have scattered those shreds to the wind from atop a hill. Were there any high hills in Madrid, which there are not so instead, I speak the strides in buckets of water until I were back pulp, yes, pulp. Please correct your gruesome error in future additions or I will ensure you become the laughingstock of the reference book world and you will weep with shame. Not that spangle bag sees no reason to advance his own belief that hand dire this has something to do with thick poultry. To him, it would have been to point out the obvious like saying that water is wet that the pope is Catholic or that hooting yard is by far the loveliest thing on the World Wide Web. And not just by far but far and away away with the fairies, tiny, delicate, shimmering beings with wings, which, if they exist, must exist only in cottingley wherever they are made out of paper, and held in place in the garden by means of pins. How permanent is the fact that this odd little man spangled bag lived his whole life in mudchute, only rarely roaming farther afield. I think it's crucial. It made him what he was even before the construction of the Docklands Light Railway. It is as if he embodied the spirit of the place, mud shoots, mud and mud shoots shoot the caked black stinking mud and the gleaming metal shoot down widget slides and slivers and tumbles into God knows what foul pit of hideousness and

message have some juvenilia one day, light in the last century, I acted as an uncle to my son Sam, who was then a tiny tot, he told me a story, and I wrote it down. Then I typed it up and made it into a little pamphlet entitled The story of the castle, the knight and the dragon, out of print. Here is that story. And, as I say it was written, made up by my son Sam when he was very young indeed.

Frank Key  13:42
Once there was a brave knight, and the brave knight, her the sort of Dragon noise. And when he heard it, he went to tell his gang of knights to search for the dragon and kill it, and I couldn't find it. Well, in the end, they found it and they killed it. And they went to tell the king and queen and the Prince and the princess and all the other people in the kingdom. When they found there was another dragon. And the king ran up to the train and he pulled the drawbridge up to the draft so the dragon couldn't get in, and the Queen looked out the window to see if the dragon fell into the water around the castle. The moat of the dragon had flown over the mountains and ran back as fast as it could and busted the drawbridge open. And suddenly the king and queen was surprised because the brave knight put a stare and put a spear into the dragon's tummy and the dragon was dead. So the night went to tell the people in the kingdom then I saw that the dragon came alive again. And it was a magic spell when the dragon came alive again, because the dragon was nice, really. And they found out that it could split It said to them that it will do everything for them in the kingdom. It would even find the cannonballs for them. And that's the end.

Frank Key  15:35
Well, that was a story from one of my one of my children when a tiny tot, and here is a story about me, when I was a tiny tot, this is a true piece of autobiography. There is a phrase I recall from my childhood, regularly used by my mother, when I Dippy and dreamy was getting ready for school in the mornings. One of these days, she would say in her Flemish accent, you will go out without your own head. pitch. I thought that is alarmist talk. But then, one winter's morning my mother's prediction came true. I set off the school in the wind and snow having left my head snoozing on the pillow. I suspect the people by past in the street must have been astonished at the side of the boy without a head. But I cannot say for sure, because of course I was completely unaware of them. My ears and eyes launched as they were in my head were warm and snug and Stella bed. Social media was I with the route to school along the lane and pass the duck pond and the fireworks factory and through the tunnel under the motorway and then along the canal towpath and pass the aerodrome and the vinegar works, that I had no need of my heads to get me there. It was only when I sat down at my desk in the classroom, that things went awry. In those days, you see we were taught such piffle as reading and writing and arithmetic and Latin and history. So my not having a head sent the teachers into a kerfuffle. I'm told there was some kind of emergency meeting in the staff room, a fog of pipe smoke, then of course, and I was put in isolation in the sick room while they worked out what to do. How much more enlightened would things be today? head or no head? I'm sure there would be no attempt to exclude me from the diversity and self esteem lessons. Indeed, my headless presence would be seen as a benefit both to myself and to my fellow pupils, and to the teachers themselves. In fact, I probably get a prize just for not having a head. On the rare occasions, prizes were dished out in those far off days, they were inevitably booked tokens. And I would certainly not have got one for not having a head. No. Now I could expect something useful, like a new app for my iPad app or a voucher for pizza cabin. But back then I was kept locked in the sick room excluded, and with my self esteem crushed all because I'd come to school without my head. I would like to say that I sat there reflecting ruefully that my mother had been right all along, but any reflection rueful or otherwise wasn't possible without my head, resting happily on the pillow back home. What happened was that the school doctor that sorry, what happened was at the school called in a local doctor who made a snap diagnosis. After looking at me for about three seconds. He didn't even use his stethoscope puffing on his pipe. He informed the headmaster in a grave doctor me voice that I showed all the symptoms of not having a head and the best treatment was brisk exercise in the open air. So they sent me running round and round the athletics crack all day until the bell rang. hometime I got a ticking off from the gym teacher to withdraw was thankfully oblivious. And then I was pointed in the direction of the canal towpath and told not to forget my head again, or there would be ramifications. Yes, they used they used to use long words like ramifications, even with headless tinies. What a different world it was. I trudged home in the wind and snow went up to my bedroom, plopped my head back onto my neck and sat down to warm myself in front of the gas fire. How could it be? I wondered that the school was even open in such inclement weather. Soon it was time for tea. We had sausages and mash. It was only as I sat down at the table and tucked my serviette under my chin, that I realized I put my head on back to front.

So that was a childhood anecdote. And now here's an adulthood anecdote. This happened a little while ago. I was discussing the music of Karl Heinz Stockhausen with the ghost of his first wife, Doris. Is it true I asked that Stockhausen was covertly funded by the CIA in an attempt to demoralize German culture after the Second World War. Doris was one of those mute ghosts we've been hearing so much about lately, but I hoped she would either nod or shake her head in reply. But her Phantom head remained motionless, motionless, atop her Phantom neck, dressing at a disconcerting angle from between her Phantom shoulders, draped in a shawl of surpassing the loveliness, which was all too real, as I knew, because I had touched it when gently pressing her down into her chair. Well, not her chair, but a chair, the chair into which I press all my ghostly visitors, unless you get them firmly nestled, they have a tendency to float and forget about the room, and even to spray themselves across the ceiling. Not all ghosts come when I summon them. But Doris did. A few seconds after my ear splitting incantation. There was a faint tapping at my door. I opened it, and there already with the ghost of Doris Stockhausen, she handed over my 50 fenech fee in cash that was pleasingly of this to two solid world. I checked, and allowed herself to be ushered in and settled in the chair. But I have not reckoned on her being a mute ghost. She sat across from me siccing me with her bail for countenance silence as the grave from which I had summoned her. With no prospect of the conversation I had so looked forward to. I went to rummage among my cassettes until I found the tape of her ex husband's demoon I wonder if hearing it again after all these years, Doris might be in some measure animated. When I returned to the room, Doris had escaped her chair and was splayed across the ceiling. The surpassing really lovely Shawn was hanging from her Phantom shoulders, so I gave it a tug, hoping to dislodge her. And indeed, she lost contact with the ceiling, hovering in midair for a moment before darting this way and that finally settling a top a top a toffee cable. Oops, I'm in a coffee table. Using thumbtacks I secured the shore to the table, holding Doris in place. The table was one of those fashionably distressed coffee tables, so the addition of a dozen tack pricks would only add to it photo dilapidation. There was every possibility that the ghost of Doris Stockhausen would slip or waft from beneath the shore and go skittering about. I slotted the cassette into the cassette player, pressed play and cranked up the volume. Let us listen to demoon faroush. Stockhausen, I cried with perhaps in excess of jollity the typist and then the room was filled with the sound of a German man moaning melodiously ish. startled, I saw Doris suddenly clap her ghostly hands over her ghostly ears. Then she began to vibrate horribly. I turned the music off, but it was too late. With a wash, Doris shot up to the ceiling, taking the surpassingly lovely shawl and the coffee table with her. try as I might, I could not come sat down. Not only was I unable to use my coffee table to display my coffee table books, of which I owned oodles, but soon enough, Doris outstayed her allotted time in the realm of the living afforded by the 50 pfennig fee I had charged her. Six weeks later she was still there. clinging to my ceiling, the shoreland table swinging gently Benita in time with her ghostly panting I had not realized how violently ghosts pant, particularly the mute ones.

at my wit's end, I consulted a local spirit medium who specialized in the demoralization of German culture in the aftermath of World War Two. He was a rather curious fellow, his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness. But these luxuriance is only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost the same color as the done the white sockets in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression, and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. Hand me that cassette player, he boomed, standing directly beneath the ghost of Doris and the shawl on the coffee table. I did his bidding, and he took from his pocket a battered cassette tape. I shall never forget what happened next. He bought the cassette into the machine, pressed play, and cranked up the volume. There was the familiar hiss, and then the sound of acapella German voices. warbling melodiously, we'd know ish about it. The first of the choruses for Doris by Doris his ex husband, Karl Heinz Stockhausen. The spirit medium stepped, or rather lumbered grotesquely to one side, and the ghost of Doris let go over the ceiling, and wafted elegantly down shoreland coffee table and all the table landing with a slight bump on the floor. As the chorus continued, the medium removed the thumbtacks, one by one, the ghost of Doris rose slightly, hovering just above the coffee table, shimmered for a few seconds, and then seem to dissolve before my eyes. Weirdly, that in Juba terribly real and ghostly shoal of surpassing loveliness, dissolved with her, then even more weirdly, the spirit medium dissolved to taking a handful of my thumbtacks with him into the ethereal realm, beyond my puny understanding. I was alone in my room, listening to the choruses for Doris and thinking to myself that postwar German culture had not, after all, been demoralized, in spite of the alleged efforts of the CIA and Karlheinz Stockhausen. And that's, and that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. I'll read some more stuff to you next week. Bye for now and thanks as ever to john for engineering it.
