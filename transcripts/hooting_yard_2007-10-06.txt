Good evening This is hooting yard on the air. With me Frank key our new time of 630 on Thursdays. This is called bashing biscuit tins. If you were fortunate enough to be hanging around with Blodgett on a Thursday morning in the middle in years of the last century, you would as likely as not have been witness to a display of rare skill for it was Blodgett enduring habit in those days on Thursday mornings to bash out various national anthems using his fists and sometimes sticks on the base of an upturned biscuit tin. He would have eaten all the biscuits for his breakfast, of course, Blodgett had learned by heart the national anthem of almost every state and statelet on the planet, reduced each one to its rhythmic core, and bashed them out on biscuit tins. He would do this at home, or by the edge of a pond, or halfway up a hillside. In truth, it mattered not where he was, but he had fallen into a routine. Thursday meant biscuits for breakfast, then battling out anthems. So energetically did he thump and bash that by the end of his recital, the biscuit tin would be a dented and effectively destroyed thing. Apparently, he passed the ruined tins on to dress but pox Haven, the sinister scrap metal dealer whose yard was a few doors away from Blodgett chalet. Blodgett was not fussy about his biscuits and would gobble down whatever the tin contained, the biscuit shop was conveniently located between his chalet and pox haven the yard. So you can see that Fortune favors the accomplishment of his designs. He might take his 10 to the pond or to the hillside, if the weather was balmy, but if it rained, or there were 10, pests and cataclysms, he would hurry back indoors. I'm not sure if he kept a dog at this time, but if he did, it was probably the death dog which we know he became fond. its lack of hearing, rendering it oblivious to the frantic bashing of the biscuit tins. It would be useful to gain some clarity about this, because it raises the possibility that Blodgett may have bought a ton of dog biscuits from time to time, and given them to the dog rather than bolting them down himself, which would have been a boon at such time as those Blodgett suffered from stomach cramps. Certainly, there's evidence that the biscuit shop sold dog biscuits as well as biscuits for human beings. It also sold hard tack biscuits for the many jolly jack, tars and Matt a lot, who congregated at the key side babbling incoherent maritime jibberish, while gutting fish in a desultory fashion. I have said that sometimes Blodgett bashed his biscuit tins with his fists, and that sometimes he deployed a pair of sticks. Had you asked him about this, he would have explained that the different tambours of fists and sticks were appropriate for certain national anthems. Indeed, one of his little mottos at the time was European fists, South American sticks, which we always shouted with great enthusiasm. That leaves unclear the preferred thumping implement for the anthems of other continents. But Blodgett was the first to admit that he was not yet fully ofay with all the anthems in the world, just most of them. This may have been a specious claim, but who, in that record seaport knew enough to challenge him? Certainly not pox Haven, whose knowledge of music was confined to his eerie renditions of Cab Calloway is Minnie the moocher, drunkenly wild under the moonlight as he staggered out of the cow and pins. It was only on Thursdays that Blodgett ate biscuits for breakfast. The rest of the week, he strained to soccer glutinous purple goo through a straw.

He had been assured by a quack that it was a miracle glue, a panacea for all known ailments, corporeal and cerebral, that by ingesting it, he would in all likelihood, treat death itself. To be sure the quack himself looked to be at least 200 years old, and still went tobogganing every winter. Well, this is what he told blood In any case, it's a pity that we do not know the recipe for the glue for we could mix up a supply and subjected to lab tests with our wiser heads, or we know with any certainty is that Blodgett wants describe the taste of the glue, as approximating to that of the straw through which he sucked it in the years of which I speak, such as straw would most likely have been made from cardboard. Of course, neither Blodgett nor anyone else became immortal by sucking goo through a straw. But long before his death, he had abandoned his Thursday morning biscuit tin bashing. Why, it would be an exaggeration to say, as Ford Madox Ford does at the beginning of the good soldier. This is the saddest story I have ever heard. But I'll admit that when I heard all about it, I sniffled into a napkin, draft birth pox, Ivan had it turned out been holding all those battered and dented biscuit tins, rather than flattening them with his big pulverizing machine and selling the tin to attend buyer, as one might have expected him to do. But I told you he was sinister. Now he built a huge collection of biscuit tins into a tower out at the front of his yard for no other reason than a deluded sense of self importance. He hoisted a flag embroidered with his likeness atop the tin tower, and took to perching up there in all weathers, like some aesthetic of the ancient world, except that rather than contemplating the ineffable, he held implications and spittle upon the citizenry below. He was bonkers as well as sinister. But the biscuit tins remember what bent and battered and the tower was unsafe. And one day a gale swept in from the west, and the tower toppled, and it toppled that the precise moment that Mrs. purgative the proprietors of the biscuit shop was pulling up her shutters, and she was buried under the biscuit tins and the flag pole and the flag and POC saven himself, who somehow survived. Mrs. purgative did not. And soon her shop was taken over by a potato magnate, and no more biscuits were sold in the town. From that day to this as Broderick was to reflect when writing his memoirs, many years later, potatoes come in sacks rather than in tins. And you cannot bash out the national anthems of the world on burlap with fists or sticks or anything else. And so he ceases Thursday morning biscuit, scoffing at his rhythmic thumping of biscuit tins. And on those days, too, he sucked glutinous purple goo through a straw for breakfast, but it did not save him.

From Blodgett to Dobson It has been said that Dobson the out of print pamphleteer bestrode the 20th century like a Colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself when still a young man. At the age of 20. He published a pamphlet resoundingly titled, why I shall bestride this century like a Colossus it's a curious work out of print, of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper Swan on the cover. It begins thus I shall be stride this century like a Colossus, my name will ring out like a clarion in years to come. Whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers there will be but one name on their lips. Dobson. Sandra's self belief in so Calloway youth is touching, looking back in his dotage. Dobson found it touching too, and he took a sitting with his one remaining copy of the pamphlet clutched to his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end. When marigold Chu found him thus, she flung open the windows, whatever the weather and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea shanties, ones that involve pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sail, cloth and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson's self pitying lassitude would be broken, and he would hold a curiously pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe away his tears, Dawn, his Bolivian military boots and his Stalinist cardigan and crash out The house to go on one of his joints. Dobson's joints in the latter part of his life usually took him to the nearest pigsty. But there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets had two names. One both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other devised by Yoko Ono as part of an art project to promote world peace. Postal delivery persons in that city were required by law to learn all the double street names by heart also face summary dismissal if they failed, often those who did fail, and there were many would flounce around on the outskirts of the city warning travelers away. It was a paltry sort of revenge and seldom succeeded, for the delight of that shining city on a hill attracted wayfarers from near and far daily in their thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before this particular Tuesday. A dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he was about to cross a pontoon bridge that would take him into the most boisterous quarter of the city. go no further old man, said there's vengeful figure whose yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath. His hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness. But these luxurious is only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same color as the Dan white sockets in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression, and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. This city you approach is no place for out of print pamphleteers ever sensitive to warnings from spooks, and wraiths Dobson turned around and went home. He found marigold true in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous sheet of corrugated cardboard. I was warmed away from a shining city on a hill he said, Is it a city you have visited? marigold true stopped drilling reset the safety catch and removed her protective goggles. You're a foolish old man in your dotage Dobson she said though there was kindness in her voice. And it is well you were warned away for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill it sits atop is hollow and contains heaven and some say it contains hell. Either way, I'm pleased to see you home. Let us clear the nettles from the vegetable patch. That was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century did Dobson indeed bestride it as a Colossus, he was not the only person to think so, but the names of the others escaped me for the time being when I remember them, I'll tell you.

That piece, entitled Colossus has been selected as a set text for the entrance examinations to bodgers Spinney infant school. And here are some sample questions likely to be faced by the tiny candidates. Question one, imagine you are the dismissed postal delivery person who encounters Dobson by the pontoon bridge. Would you have handled the situation in the same way? Think about what you would have said to the out of print pamphlet here, then translated into Latin. Question two, do you think Yoko Ono's unnecessary double naming of the streets in the shining city on the hill would make a significant contribution to world peace? give reasons for your answer in terse cogent prose, then translate that into Latin two. Three, give a brief account of the career of David Blunkett with special reference to his second resignation, speech and tear for use of the phrase the little lad or was that the first resignation speech? For if you could bestride a century like a Colossus, which century would you choose? SOTA, bestride and why? Extra marks will be awarded if you turn pale nor the end of your pencil in desperation, and crumpled to the floor twitching and shattered

So, send in your if you want to try the entrance exam for boggers Spinney infant school no matter how old you are, send your entries in to me, courtesy of resonance. On more than one occasion, I found myself locked in a chamber with an oily get. It's not an experience for the faint hearted, and I have certificates. Let me tell you something I made damn sure I kept my certificates far away from the oily get at the times I was locked up with him, because he would have smudged them just as he smudges anything with which he comes into contact. He can't help himself. It's what he does. It's the essence of him in many ways. He's a smarter, a smarter, good and proper, and it's both sickening and heartbreaking to watch because he smudges things, you feel helpless to stop him and he would never be able to stop him smudging. In any case, no matter how many certificates you would accrued and clutched to your bosom with pride. At the last count I had 46 certificates, but rather than clutching them to my bosom, I kept them in a locker and their locker is padlocked with double padlocks and the keys to the padlocks are locked up in a separate locker to which the key is hidden. As for me, yet again, I'm locked up with the oily gate, and he's already smashed the walls and the floor and even the ceiling with his antics, and it's only through my quick Wits that I remain so far and smudged. But sooner or later, the oily get will insist on clasping me in a bear hug in a fit of misplaced cameraderie and then I will end up smudged again until they let me out of the chamber one day. I have the benefit of knowing that my certificates are safe, Bobo will probably curl up at the edges for the locker is in a place of much humidity. I have hunted for a spare locker in a place of less humidity or even have no significant humidity at all. And I was following up a lead on such a locker when I once again found myself being locked up with the oily gate. I suppose that particular locker will be taken by the time they let me out one day, but I'm nothing if not indefatigable, I will wash off the smudges and check my certificates in that order. And then I will ascertain whether the locker is still spare and if as is likely it's been taken I will redouble my efforts and hunt for another similar locker in a place of little or no humidity to which I will transfer my certificates once I have been entrusted with the keys and of course I will add a pair of padlocks for additional security. It is the thought of being able to do this one day that makes my time in the chamber with the oily good bearable. Though I say nothing about it to him. I tried to speak to him as little as possible other than to fend off his attempted bear hugs for as long as it's seemly. Even though I know that sooner or later I will succumb and be hugged and smudged. It was ever Thus, the only get has no certificates at all, as far as I know. But I've seen a couple of smushed coupons sticking out of his coat pocket. I have not had a chance to examine them closely. But I suspect their coupons are little value the sorts that are handed to get oily or non oily by those who distribute such things. It's quite possible that the oily get is very pleased with his coupons and treasures them I would rather boil my

Frank Key  18:50
own head than be seen with a couple of coupons sticking out of my coat pocket. But there you go. He is an oily get and I am not for the time being we are locked together in this chamber yet again, and though I may become smudged, you can rest assured that neither his oiliness nor his get them will rub off on me. Remember, I have 46 certificates and they don't poke out of my pocket like tawdry Jamboree prizes. They're kept safe in a padlock locker and soon I trust they will be safer in a better locker while I'm in a place less humid than my current locker. I bet the oily get hasn't got a locker and if he did its door would be smudged and neighboring lockers would be shunned by all righteous and upstanding persons. The oily get does not even wear a hat for goodness sake. It's true that I removed my hat when locked in the chamber with him and of course it rapidly becomes smudged but I pride myself on one manners. That is another thing I have to do when they let me out which is to get my hat washed. I may do that before checking up on my certificates depending on my state of mind and how badly smell smudge the hat is, you can appreciate that there is much I must take into account. Even if for the time being I'm in a kind of limbo. The Pope recently announced that Limbo did not exist. But he was referring to that ethereal realm where unbaptized infants who pass away were long thought to languish until such time as the mercy of God allowed them into heaven. But that's not the limbo to which I refer. And after all, I'm both an adult and a righteous and upstanding one with 46 certificates. And as far as I'm aware, I was back to baptize soon after my birth all those decades ago. It's hard to tell whether the oily get is older than me or younger, but I think we can be sure as eggs is eggs that he was never baptized. Had he been he would not now be an oily get our wager. Another thing I can quite clearly see even from the confines of this chamber, is that I shall inherit my kingdom whereas the oily get will bat bite on bitter fruit, and never shall I allow him to smudge my kingdom, for it will be pristine. There will be antelopes in my kingdom, elegant and high in the withers. And I shall look upon them from my turret. And where will we oily get be then? Why he will remain locked up in the chamber, smudging the floors and the walls and the ceiling, biting upon smudged and bitter fruits and seeds.

The next bit is an extract from a work in progress. The some notes towards the history of blister lane bypass. Can we decently admire a feat of engineering which led to the destruction of an owl sanctuary, the obliteration of a fairground, and the destitution of a grubby yet lovable hamlet of genetically intriguing peasants. For some, the answer is a straightforward No, they will point to the fact and they are unassailable fact that the blister lane bypass was completely unnecessary, and that in the years since its construction, a handful of carts have ever been seen toiling along. It's gray Stalinist impactor Yes, I meant carts, not cars. Conversely, one might argue that ours are hardly in need of sanctuary that the fairground was a den of iniquity, and that the peasants would presumably rather be sunken porphyry than be sent to the salt mines. Let's not forget that owls are savage and pitiless birds of prey. Do you imagine that if the tables were turned, such creatures would provide humans with a refuge? the fairground was a notorious sink advice. If we are ever to revive in young hoodies the virtues of piety and probity, such places of so called entertainment will have to be burned to the ground, roadworks or no roadworks. As for the Hamlet, it is true that the peasants hopeless hovels were smashed and destroyed during construction of the bypass. But they're free to gather at the roadside in the wind and the rain, Hawking their baubles and moaning their dirge is free to to accept arms from any passing traffic. They were not I repeat, sent to the salt mines, primarily because we have no salt mines in this fabulous land. The original plans drawn up for the blister lane bypass are among the loveliest drawings I have ever seen. They were done in a variety of colored crayons on gigantic sheets of greaseproof paper, and have a child like vivacity, annotated as they are with marginal pictograms of heraldic beasts, imaginary cloud formations, and cartoonish tombstones and more earlier. It has been suggested that the infant tile quality of the drawings is due to the fact that the plans were nothing more than a wet Thursday afternoon project for the tinies of Pang Hill orphanage, and that there was never any serious intent to build the bypass at all. This is poppycock. One advantage of the bypass that is often overlooked, and never Of course, mentioned by the sort of fat heads who prattle on about poor fluffy owls is that a cart laden with canisters full of volatile gas or toxic sludge now has an impeccably flat level surface to crumble along. Some of us remember when such cargos had to negotiate twisting tracks riddled with potholes and crevices with the constant risk of toppling over Such spillages explain why there are so many poisonous ponds and ditches riddled with mutant toads throughout our land. It is true that such a cart will only be seen on ballista lane bypass once in a blue moon. But all great advances begin with tiny steps, or in this case, tiny triangles. The bypass has been celebrated in song, most notably perhaps in trebizond Oh cold peppers opera booth, Ariadne alpha knack sauce and blister lane bypass. A tremendously exciting and inadvertently blood drenched production was given at the bulges spinny variety theater to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first hammer blow to the head of a grubby peasant protester. To end these brief notes, here is a little quiz. How many tunnels were built under the bypass to allow safe crossing for badges, stoats and weasels? Was it a one, b 666 or C umpteen thousands ounces next week?

fats nearly the end of this week's program but before we go, just a reminder about the hooting yard allocation of weeks. Last week was Our Lady of pituitary gland. This week, of course is the goon Fang Pinocchio of camshafts. And next week, is the complaisant harems of totteridge and whetstone. Please ensure that your beads and counters are correctly aligned and that your cushions are embroidered appropriately. If you'll be eating any figs during the next week, please be sure to keep them in a covered bowl and the bowl is slightly tilted on your shelf. When all the figs have been eaten and the bowl is empty, smash it but do not smash it in the fireplace. There should be a cord on sanitaire around the fireplace from the week of Parcells so that we have great civil engineering scandals. shoe laces ought to be tied according to the Winkelmann formula. diagrams for guidance can be downloaded from the website.
