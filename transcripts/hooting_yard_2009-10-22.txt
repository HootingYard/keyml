Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air back. We weren't here last week because of the frieze Art Fair. But we're back this week, and I'd like to begin this show with an extract from the diary of Helio gobblers. These are historically accurate diary entries. From the diary of Helio gapless Monday I celebrated the right of the tour oboe Liam tossing my head to and fro among the castrated devotees of the Great Mother Goddess. I in fibrillated myself, and did all that the eunuch priests are want to do. also decided to celebrate the right of Salah Lambo with all wailing and frenzy of the Syrian cult. Tuesday, I set aside a room in the palace, and they're committed my in decencies always standing nude at the door of the room as the harlots do, and shaking the curtain which hung from gold rings, while in a soft and melting voice. I solicited the passes by Wednesday, I made a public bath in the Imperial Palace, and at the same time through open the bath of platonists to the populace, that by this means I might get a supply of men with unusually large organs. I also took care to have the whole city and the wolves searched for, oh knobbly as these are called, who seemed particularly lusty Thursday, had a banquet. I used silver urns and casseroles and vessels of chaste silver 100 pounds in weight, some of them decorated with the latest designs. I concocted wine seasoned with mastic and with Penny royal and I had rose wine made more fragrant by adding pulverized pine cone. I made forcemeat of fish and of oysters of various kinds, or similar shellfish and of lobsters, crayfish and squirrels, I strewed roses and all manner of flowers such as lilies, violets, higher sinced, and Narcissus over my banqueting rooms, couches and porticos and then strolled about in them. I refused to swim in a poll was not perfumed with saffron, or some other well known essence, and I could not rest easily on cushions that were not stuffed with rabbit fur or feathers from under the wings of partridges and I changed the pillows frequently. In imitation of appic ears, I ate camels, heels and also Cox combs taken from the living birds, and the tongues of peacocks and nightingales because I was told that one who ate them with immune from the plague. I served to the palace attendant, huge platters he put up with the visca of mullets and Flamingo brains, Partridge, eggs, thrush, brains, and the heads of parrots, pheasants and peacocks. And the beards of the mullet that I ordered to be served were so large that they were brought on in place of Cress or parsley, or pickled beans or fenugreek. In well filled bowls, and disc shaped platters, a particularly amazing performance, I thought. Friday, I finished building the reversible ceiling panels. Once I have packed sufficient violets and rose petals into the space above, I will invite my rivals and parasites to another banquet, and then have a factotum pull a lever to release the panels and thus will I smothered to death my guests under the cascade of violence and rose petals. Saturday, I drove a chariot drawn by four elephants on the Vatican Hill, destroying the tombs which obstructed the way and I harnessed for camels to carry it at a private spectacle in the circus. Then I collected serpens with the aid of priest of the mastic nation and suddenly let them loose before dawn when the popular assembled for the more frequented games, and many people were injured by their fangs. Sunday, I shut up a vast number of flies in a jar and called them tamed bees.

Monday, I am confident My name will be branded in history above all others because of my unspeakably disgusting life.

So I think the lesson there is don't mess with Helio gobblers. onwards. The Blue Flag tatty at half mast, indicates to those watching on the shore that a shoal is present just beyond the sandbank a quarter of a mile out. The green flag is displayed when no shows can be seen from the helicopters. It can be difficult to tell blue from green at certain times of day even for those without the condition of Dalton ism. In milky light or when a vapor haze descends. The color of the flag might be blue or green or gray to any but the most acute observer. Work has begun on developing more robust dyes for the flags. Some have suggested issuing the watches on the shore with pragmatically enhanced telescopes. Trained cormorants have also been mentioned in a rogue report, although what role they would play remains sketchy. These are testing times set a brigadier with a great personal investment in shoals. He was supported by those who dwell on the sandbank in cardboard shelters, whose voices are so rarely heard above the din divers shell lists and the cadets responsible for the darling of the flags I grew to appear later in the week. So who are they these folk who dwell on the sandbank in cardboard shelters. For the most part, they are retired salute old hands who met each other long ago at the picnic for detectives, where they discovered a shared interest in sand banks, cardboard hovels, and monsters of the deep. They pointedly ignore the shoals that swim in the shallows beyond the sand bank. There is not an angler among them. The occasional sighting of a lobster or a jellyfish excites them, and such as the brouhaha that one or more of the cardboard shelters collapses from over buffeting and has to be re erected before the stars come out at night. Not even the hardiest of retired detectives wants to spend the hours of darkness exposed on a sandbank to the pitiless gleam of moon and stars. They have their superstitions and irrational fears these dwellers on the sand bank, just like anybody else. in daylight, they keep watch on the waters. Summer armed with electronic devices run on batteries. They tick off sightings of minor monsters such as the aforementioned lobsters and jellyfish in ledges. But what all of them await is for there to be a great uncanny churning Maelstrom, from which emerges a gigantic and terrible secret just never before seen by human detective eyes. They set traps and laws so they know not precisely what might tempt such a monster sprat minnows, scraps of cardboard, the liver in light of a hair or a crow, they have tried all these to no avail. Every so often, the wind whips in and blows their cardboard shelters into the sea. Then the more nautically gifted of the retired sleuth those who once worked in plain clothes aboard ocean liners and cruise ships, perhaps bound into a rowing boat and strange retrieve the precious cardboard sheets. There is plenty of space on the sand bank to lay out the soaked and wind scarred cardboard for drying out in the sun. in homage to the old days, they picnic these sand bank sleuth and they picnic hard, not for them such girly snacks as watercress sandwiches with the crust cut off. They bite the lids off jam jars and spit them into a pit. Drifting sand ah drifting sands soon covered Have lids. It is it faced from the planet's surface as if it had never been. But down there beneath the sand. attracted by the metal lids, there are creatures burrowing, blind mole like creatures that sniffed the metal and the traces of raspberry jam and marmalade adhering to the metal, and they borrow with their snouts and claws. And one night soon, they will push their gruesome heads above the sand and exalt in the moonlight and gorge themselves on jam and marmalade and cardboard and sleeping sleuths.

In that piece, I mentioned the picnic for detectives. This is a an old favorite hooting yard and I have had requests from a couple of listeners to remind you have it. So here is the picnic information about the picnic for detectives. This annual event has become one of the key dates in the hooting yard calendar, which is somewhat surprising, surprising, given it's in glorious beginnings. The very first picnic for detectives was hardly a picnic at all. And the official historian of the event estimates that only a handful of those taking part were bonafide detectives. All we know for certain is that a small group of people no more than four or five, picked up in a field with a couple of hampers, and spent an afternoon there. meteorological records show the day was one of Arctic schools, but the field was in a temperate zone inland. In fact, it was just across the road from Pang Hill orphanage. This anomaly has fascinated whether fixated picnic for detectives buffs who are legion so not only do we have just a few people with a couple of hampers, we do not even know what was in those hampers. If you're familiar with ordinary picnics, you would expect to open up a hamper to find sandwiches, savory flans, some fruit crackers, cheese related foodstuffs, cake and bottles of refreshing barley water. Hard Boiled eggs would be likely to unless the film director Alfred Hitchcock was one of the picnic as far as we know from the many biographies, he was terrified of eggs. Hitchcock was not present at the picnic across the road from the orphanage that is now counted as the first picnic for detectives. But unfortunately, we do not know the names of those who were. In fact, the whole thing is shrouded in mystery, or we can say for certain is that the following year, in the very same field, there was a second picnic, and this one was attended only by detectives, either by chance or design. This second picnic was blessed with what the records call humid Bolinas and scattered dappling sunlight. examination of surviving crumbs from the site indicates that all sorts of pies were eaten with or without cutlery. I for one hope they did use cutlery or at least forks wrote Sydney CAC. For there is something disconcerting and undignified in the mental image of a team of Tip Top detectives sprawled in a field shoveling pie into their mouths with their fingers. It seems that those resounding words picnic for detectives were first used a year later. The third picnic is the one that became legendary. Over 40 detectives gathered in the field and their hampers were each emblazoned with a badge a heraldic device, a coat of arms, an emblem, each one caked in mud as a safeguard. The picnic menu was written down for the first time and to this day is recited at the crack of every dawn by the urchins in the orphanage. It was at this third picnic for detectives that a pack of beagles was employed to frighten off swooping crows, magpies goals and other scavenging creatures with beaks and wings. Nowadays, the beagles in the pack are bred specially in the detectives Beagle breeding compound their psychological state carefully monitored while they are still puppies one innovation at The third picnic for detectives which did not survive was musical accompaniment. The experimental percussionist Zoltan taplow, was invited along despite having no background in police work, he was stationed in a corner of the field and asked to play suitable picnic music is energetic thumping upon reconditioned metal drums and shamanic gongs was drowned out that day by howling winds and the steady convoy of cement mix of trucks, grayling along the road. There is one body of opinion, which suggests that Tableau was merely a figment of the overheated imagination of one of the detectives at all stooping forensics specialist who had spent too much of his career aboard ships, the absence of Tableau from nearly all A to Zed directories of experimental percussionists tends to support this view.

The music real or imagined was inaudible, but the picnic itself was a triumph. It is the subject of two novels a stage play a long running television, cereal and Opera and no less than three films, the finest of which is probably picnic for detectives three, the title of which was changed to hot picnic for detectives impact by the distributors concerned that cinema goers would be confused into assuming they had missed two earlier features. Detective Captain shatavari, who was given a sabbatical from the force to produce and direct the film disowned it, but he need not have done for it as a towering work. It may be that his critical faculties deserted him when immediately after completing the film, he was badly injured when attacked by a swarm. It is certainly true that his nerves never recovered, and he spent what ought to have been the prime of his career chewing toffee in the hot house of a nursing home surrounded by gigantic and abominable plants. By the time shutter, his film came out, the third picnic for detectives was last in the past, a sepia tinge memory of tweed suits massive walrus mustaches, essence of violet organdy ruffles reticules and Gladstone bags from the fourth year onwards with the introduction of lobsters on the menu picnic for detectives took on it startling calendrical significance, who today can imagine a year in hooting yard without it. Remarkably little has changed over the years. Still, there is the ceremonial Mark pastor retired detectives on picnic for detectives Eve, where the wheelchairs of the infirm ancients are pushed along by teams of tops from Pang Hill orphanage. Still, the lobster pots are made of beaten bronze and a factory far away. Still, the field is laced with buttercups and dandy lines and spurge allowed to spread. Still, anxious eyes are cast up to the skies in the morning. The weather discussed in almost insane detail, but all who linger on the Pang Hill pathways. Still, the hampers bear badges which glisten under their caking of mud. And still there are detectives and still there is a picnic for them in hooting yard. But once a year come hell or high water come rain or shine.

There are great unwritten works we mourn books there offers planned but never penned Ruskin's survey of Swiss towns and villages is one Dobson's series of pamphlets provisionally entitled sundry impairments of the mists and the marshes is another. We know from his scribblings that the out of print pamphleteer intended to write no fewer than 16 essays, each devoted to a particular menace of mist and Marsh, yet he never completed a single one, nor even began any of them, possibly due to sheer unalloyed ignorance. So when we want to familiarize ourselves With so important a topic, we must turn to Daniel Defoe. And this is an extract from his tour through the whole island of Great Britain, which was published between 1724 and 1726. I have one remark more before I leave this damp part of the world, and which I cannot admit on the women's account, namely, that I took notice of a strange decay of the sex here. In so much for all along this county, it was very frequent to meet with men that had from five or six to 14 or 15 wives, Nay, and some more. And I was informed that in the marshes on the other side of the river over against candy Island, there was a farmer, who was then living with the five and 20th wife, and that his son who was but about 35 years old, had already had about 14. Indeed, this part of the story, I only had by report from good hands too, but the other is well known and easy to be the inquired into about fobbing, carrying them. thundersley benfleet prittlewell wakering great. stanbridge cryptsy Burnham, dengie, and other towns have the likes situation. The reason as a married fellow told me, who said he had had about a dozen and a half of wives. Though I found afterwards he fibbed a little was this, that they being bred in the marshes themselves, and seasoned to the place did pretty well with it. But they always went up into the hilly country, or to speak their own language into the upplands for a wife, that when they took the young LeSage, out of the wholesome and fresh air, they were healthy, fresh and clear and well, but when they came out of their native air into the marshes, among the fogs and damps. There, they presently changed their complexion, got an ag water and sell them held it about half a year or a year at most, and then said he would go to the app plans again and fetch another. Shortly after completing his 12th Symphony binder decided to take himself a wife. He had been distressed at the critical reception given to his latest work, which was considered to be extremely sorted. binder felt that perhaps some feminine influence might temper his moral grumpiness. But he knew no women, at least know women who would consent to wed him in a million years. Though he was a successful composer, he lacked a certain vital human pith. This at least was the judgment of his confident, the dwarf Keira Pascoe, who told binder that he seemed more like a cardboard cutout, or a man of cellophane, rather than a person of flesh and blood. Poor binder, we might think, yeah, there was truth in the charge. Ever since his days at the academy for tiny musical magnificant. He had lived in a sort of rarefied air world if he was a bag a wife that would have to change. The composer was living at the time in a godforsaken estuarine village surrounded by marshes and mudflats. So, one foul misty Thursday evening, he hide himself down to the tavern, where he thought he might meet a bride. But a bomb clumping through the door. He found only men, coastal peasantry and invalid sailors for the most part. He fell in with a couple of Shockers and Swaggers, who cruised and coughed in large silver cans to his Health Fellows they were that had good big pop mouths to cry, Porter Helms and George a new as well as the best what belongs to hailing a boiling is Yeah. By chance this pair whose names were Vermeer and Beamish were themselves both drew to be married.

binder, sipping from his mug of brewers fudge MK congratulated his new pals and asked if perchance their brides to be had a friend to whom he might be introduced. He had already before leaving for the tavern taken some tips from Keira Pascoe regarding vivanta vivacity dash and Erlang and was eager to practice his skills. To his surprise, vermilion Beamish fell about in hysterical fit, spitting and sloshing and slapping their side binder blushed. Eventually, his companions become themselves and vernix spoke. We know not yet who our brides will be, he said tomorrow We are heading up into the great purple hills yonder where we will find ourselves a pair of fog wives. Come with us deer trap, and there will be a fog wife for you to binder had no idea what Vermeer was talking about, but he reasoned that a fog wife was better than no wife at all. He arranged to meet the ruined sailors next morning at the crossroads or togged up and kitted out for a roaming in the purple hills. And up in those hills the next day in mid afternoon, binder and vernick and Beamish chanced upon a trio of Hill women tending their pigs on a vertiginous slope. Both the women and the pigs were lopsided for they spent all their lives on steep gradients that would be bridegroom's learned that there would be enamorado as well known as the ellipses for there were three of them and they were each named dot. vermin did most of the talking. Oh cherish a believer lopsided? girlies he declared after they had broken the ice by talking pig law. Come with us down from the hills to our misty, marshy estrie parodies Oh, were sick fog will swaddle you and be our wives. You may bring your Hill pigs for though we cannot promise them the sloping lands they are used to. We have much mud and muck and it oozes with briny goodness. dot and dot and dot repaired to a crevice in the hillside where they discussed this proposal and found it good. The very next day in the foul air of the village. The three couples were married in the dilapidated church and bells would have wrung out had sound been able to travel through the enshrouding missed the mist from the marshes that smothered and muffled and swirled sluggishly around through night and day until it penetrated the limbs and the lungs and brought.and.and.so unused to it surely to their sick beds within a 12 month. dot vermin and dot Beamish were true fog wives and before another year was out. Both lay in tuned in the fog bound churchyard. And then widowers sat in the tavern gathering their wits for another foray into the hills. But dot binder, though she suffered much from a use and knowing of the vitals, was nursed back to vigor by the wondrous passing maneuvers of the dwarf Keira Pascoe. And she lived happily with binder for many decades, and took two of her lopsided pigs to the premiere of his 49th and final Symphony. And she survived him and set up home with Keira Pascoe far from the estuary in a mountain chalet with a balcony for two bird killer guests. And then Erie adapted for the pigs and mezzotints of her long departed friends dot and dot framed upon her mantle.

And with that sad yet Curiously, happy ending sort of story about binders for wife. That's the end of this week's show. I shall be back next week to redo some more stuff. Possibly a piece called a trip from thrum to BOCES but I'm not entirely sure yet. You'll find out next week. I hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
