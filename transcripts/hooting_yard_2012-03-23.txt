Hello this is resonance 104 point four FM and this is routing yard on the air with me Frank key with a with a perfectly timed coughing fit I couldn't breathe for a moment right on Woods I'll try and get through this right frog in my throat in last week's show when I told you about our Fang Vanda hougen dog and his love song I failed to mention that he was a mountaineer. So let me put that right without further ado, our thang Vanda who can dope was a mountain air, I noted mountain air elsewhere, I wrote of him but physically he was not really cut out for mountaineering. He was described by a contemporary as a figure of untold punit and he was indeed tiny and weak, short sighted, lanky and prone to swooning fit. He was terrified of Nat horseflies and fruitbat. He had another sensitive digestive system, and had to subsist mostly on thin soup or broth. It was difficult to find a mountaineering team willing to recruit so record a specimen. So our Fang did most of his clambering up sheer rock faces solo, a man alone, testing himself against the elements. Excuse me. This description was called into question by Brian Phantasm, who took me to task in the pages of puny mountain his monthly magazine, accusing me of getting my our fangs mixed up, as if they were not exactly dozens of our Fang Vanda hougen dogs who were accomplished mountain is in love with Mrs. gubbins, and perished in the Hindenburg disaster. Granted, there might have been a couple of others. But, tellingly, Dr. Phantasm. So what is a doctor of God alone knows the doctrine of signatures on counterfeit documents probably. I think I've lost my thread. Let me begin that sentence again. Granted, there may have been a couple of other Fang Vanda hougen dogs who met the necessary criteria, but telling me Dr. Phantasm does not identify the one he accuses me of getting mixed up with the Fang Vanda who can do up I was writing about. I hope that's clear. I'm becoming somewhat befuddled in defending myself against these outrageous charges, and outrageous they are, as is Dr. phantasms dress sense, but it's best to cast a veil over that and a very thick veil made as many blankets, as if we were a prisoner being ushered between police car and police station covered to outwit the press photographers. It's my fond hope that one day Phantasm himself will be placed under arrest, and then he might stop attacking me in the pages of Little Red magazines. Our initial falling out some years ago, was occasioned by a piece he wrote In news of the screes, a small circulation mountaineering journal devoted, as its title suggests, to scry the accumulation of broken rock fragments at the base of crags, mountain cliffs or Valley shoulders. It was an ill written and intemperate rant, the gist of which when one got past the swear word was that the word scre should be dropped and replaced by talus, which means the same thing and has become the scientifically approved term. scre is an Old Norse origin, whereas talus derives from French. Now, I am neither North nor French, and our Fang van de hougen dog with sino Dutch. So my campaigning of scre is not based on any infant tile sense of chauvinism. But champion scree I do without apology in all weathers. It is clearly the more opposite word for the accumulation of broken rock fragments at the base of crags, mountain cliffs or Valley shoulders, which serves as its definition.

Go to the screen and have a go at clamoring across it if you don't believe me. Better be there when tumbling rock fragments from the upper slopes come crashing down to add to the screen and raise the air flaps of your mountaineering hat. So listen carefully. I'm sure you will agree that scry beats talus hands down, whatever our friends me and scientists may say on the matter. I wrote a letter to the editor of news of the screens arguing my point and suggesting that Dr. Phantasm was an open addenda page and probably a forger of doctored signatures on important documents. That's our war of words began and it continues to this day. So when he writes to accuse me of mixing up my art fangs, I swapped his article aside as I might swap one of the NAT Fang van de hougen dog was so frightened by that is my our Fang, of course, not one of Brian phantasms putative and identified our fangs.

My fangs but much of his mountaineering time clambering across screen is Pune in us with such that he often grew exhausted, panting, panting, panting, while barely across the screen, whatever the steepness or otherwise of its gradient, for remember that some screen is steeper than others, depending on its geographical location, and indeed the circumstances of its geological formation. Whether created by dint of mechanical weathering by ice, chemical weathering by mineral hydration and salt deposition, thermal stresses, topographic strategies, or biotic processes. Sometimes, our Fang was so puffed out from clambering over a few mere mere few yards of scree that he collapsed upon it, gazing hopelessly outwards, to where the summit he aim to ascend vanished in the clouds. Could there be a more pitiable image or a mountain air? But we must bear in mind that some scree can prove to be devilishly difficult terrain, all those rock fragments often lose can be perilous even when one is not puny. So let us not mark our Fang or rather his memory as the despicable and quite probably criminal Brian Phantasm has done in his latest piece of grievous follow the roll. no fewer than 10 pages of last week's issue of screeds on screen, were given over to a disgraceful rewriting of history in which Phantasm claims that are Fang Vanda hougen dorp uS stellt and some kind of anti panting Alex here to cross the screen at the foot of big oddly shaped mountain number seven in 1929. One of his most famous ascent and the one for which he was awarded a medal. The very medal I snapped up at an auction of our Fang van de hougen memorabilia, which was then stolen from me by a footpad who bore a striking resemblance to Brian Phantasm. I have no proof and I've never knowingly met this hellhound but my assailant had a Buffon and cummerbund and Winkle pickers, identical to those sported by Brian Phantasm. In the one grainy black and white photograph of him that I have seen a copy of which I keep pasted in my enemies book, page 149 lavender series So once again, I must take up my Butcher's pencil to rebut or refute. I can't remember which the calumnies rain down upon our Fang, but I will continue to defend his memory until the cows come home. And no, they're not coming home now, the rain soaked loam.

So, if you'd like to guess what term Horace daanish Thorpe's lifelong obsession was, send your answers to, to me@hooting.yd at gmail.com and there'll be a prize for the most amusing entry. I don't know what it is. Now I'm going to the next thing I'm going to do on this week's show is to read a spooky story. So I suggest there any tinies listening should probably be I don't know, sent off to an early bedtime or something because I may be terrified by this story. It's called the bad Vicarage. It was light On a winter's evening when I turned on to the lane leading to the bad Vicarage. There was ice in the puddles and the thorn bushes glittered in the moonlight. On the other side of a filbert hedge, a peasant person was worrying the ground with an agricultural tool. Good evening, peasant. I called Can you tell me who is Vica nowadays in the bad Vicarage? It was 20 years since I've been in these parts. I doubted that the bad Vicar of the olden days was still in residence, but I wanted to make sure Good evening to you, sir, said the peasant, resting from his Twilight labors and leaning on his implement the Vickery just a bad Vicar indeed, as bad as any Vicarage in Christendom. But the vicar who sinecure It is his, shall we say, a fair to middling Vicar. I would not call him good, but he is by no means as bad as the bad Vicar of old. Thank you, I said, and felt compelled to add. You are, I may say very well spoken for a peasant. I am a so called New peasant, said the peasant, my soul has been re engineered by the great helmsman all praise to him. It was he who ensured the destruction of the bad Vicar after all. Is that so? I asked, then praise to him indeed, as you say. Yet for all that the bad Vicarage is still bad. In spite of it's fair to middling Vicar. And though you are a new peasant, here you are at nightfall, tilling the fields or whatever you're doing with that agricultural implement, just as an old peasant would do. The countryside is the countryside, so he said, No, mickley and he went back to work. I carried on up the lane, my mind a welter of chaos. If the great helmsman had wrote the ruination of the bad Vicar, why had he left the bad Vicarage standing? And why installed in it now was a fair to middling Vicar where there no good vicars in these parts? My uncle, for example, was a good Vicar. Why had he been passed over for the sinecure? But then, was he still alive? Or had he been one of the many victims of the bad Vicar mourned and unmourned, these and other questions tagged at the reigns of my sanity? As I approached ever closer, the great forbidding gate of the bad Vicarage? As if to signal a shift in the very nature of things. Just as I raised my hand to grasp the bell pole dangling from the gate, the bright moon was of a sudden blotted out behind a cloud. I shuddered but yanked the rope, only to hear a dull flat clunk rather than a clang. Bad bell for a bad Vicarage. What else should I have expected? But the clunk had the desired effect for peering between the railings I saw the door of the battery. Vickery Creek open and emerging from it a fellow I took to be the fair to middling Vicar. He was young and Spry, and came bounding up the path to open the gate for me. You are the vicar I asked that I am he cried with unwarranted bonomi come visiting stranger for the night is a kill one and you must warm your collywobbles beside a roaring fire.

And soon enough, the two of us were sat in armchairs by the fire side, slurping from beakers of hot and vitamin enhanced goat's milk froth. Clearly in destroying the bad Vicar, the great helmsman had spared his goat. I could hear them tethered in the back garden, bleating and occasionally butting their heads against the wall. Explore explained to me, I said, coming straight to the point. How can it be that this Vickery just still a bad Vicarage? When you yourself armed with the synacor are not a bad Vicar? The fair to middling Vicar laughed, slopping some of his milk froth on to the thread bear rug at his feet. This will always be a bad Vickery, he said. The rugs are threadbare. The floorboards are rotting. The paint is chipping, the roof is falling in the heating is clapped out the drains are clogged and the goats are mad and could you not see to it that repairs are made in the goats inspected by a veterinary surgeon? I asked. He laughed. He laughed again. But this time, it was a hollow laugh of infinite despair. What would be the use? He said? Well, I said it's both the repair persons and the veterinary surgeon unstinting in their effort, it would no longer be a bad brokerage. It would become fair to middling and in time, possibly even good. Imagine that. He put his drained beaker on the rug, stood up and went to stand by the window peering out his back turned to me. You have come here, he said. After some minutes of eerie silence, on a cold winter's evening, uninvited, unannounced. I sensed you are no stranger to this place. I can hear in the bleating of the goats that they know you that they have encountered you before. Just before you arrived I received a message on my metal Tapping Machine from the new peasant stationed behind the film but hedge of the entrance to the lane. He told me you had no need to ask for directions that you made your way here with practice steps indeed, that you minced Heather as directly as a crow in flight. You nestled in the armchair by the fire and slurp for the hot on vitamin enhanced goty milk froth from the beaker I have given you and you know damn well that the rugs are threadbare, the floorboards are rotting, the paint is tripping. The roof is falling in the heating is clapped out the drains are clogged and the goats are mad and you know the bad Vicarage, as well as you know the back of your hand. Who the devil are you? And he spun around to look at me, and I looked back my red eyes gazing at him like firebolt I am the bad Vicar, I said, Come to regain my sinecure and that my summons the maddened goats, their tethers are loosed, came crashing through the window.

Wasn't that a terrifying story? Well, the tinies can come back and gather around the radio now. Actually, maybe not because what I'm about to read may not be suitable. It's a quotation from the sex war and others a survey of recent murder principally in France 1973 book by Rainer happens store and this is a passage about the 1950s 19 5700 Beside act in Britain the 1957 homicide act was criticised on many grounds and in most quarters, none criticized it more severely than those abolitionists to placate whom the bill had been brought in. That is perhaps natural enough. for them. It abolished to little, the nervous and those who simply saw no reason for change, known as retention. It's just as non motorists had, to their astonishment, come to be known as pedestrians. were dismayed to find that no more than a life sentence averaging 10 years vents forward awaited those who, for the first time as far as the law knew, and when not actively engaged in robbery, for any reason, or none killed anyone but a policeman or prison officer with poison, Cold Steel, a blunt instrument, drowning, strangulation, smothering, burning, gassing, starvation, driving a car at the victim, or tampering with his brakes, infecting him with a fatal disease, pushing him off a tall building or over a cliff, torturing him beyond what his constitution would bear, shutting him in with dangerous animals, inducing madness with drugs, hypnotic suggestion, or sustained ill treatment, and then putting the means of suicide into his hands, or leading him to believe that a fatal trap is a way to safety. Anything in fact, that a writer of detective stories might plausibly imagine, apart from prison officers and policemen, the victim might be anyone at all, a child or the queen. One of the interesting bits in that passage, I think, is written, written in the early 70s. But talking about the late 50s is when non motorists became pedestrians, we all used to be pedestrians, and then all of a sudden, we had to have a special word for us, because everyone else was driving around in cars. Reiner happens to himself was a was a unreconstructed pedestrian. And he much disapproved of the practice of people driving their cars anywhere at any time. And I have to say, I kind of agree with him. And that's all we have time for on this week's show, I think, apologize for the coughing fit earlier. But these things happen. And as you know, the show goes out live. So I'll be back next week. But in the meantime, if you go to the hooting yard website or hooting yard.org there's plenty of plenty of words to read pictures to look at books to buy. And if you'd like to, you can always send me a donation. Those are always very helpful. And one doesn't like to kind of make begging noises on air, but you know, no one at resonance gets paid. So that would be very helpful. If you could see your mind's to sending a pittance to hooting yard. You might want to send a pittance to resonance to to keep the Euro station on the air. Go to the hooting yard yard website and then go to the resonance website or vice versa. And I will be back as I say next week with more stuff to entertain and instruct and I might have some kind of lacing before the show to avoid coughing bye bye
