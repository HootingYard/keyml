good evening. This is resonance one I 4.4 fm. This is hooting out on the air. And my name is Frank key and I'm going to read to you for 28 minutes or so. Last week's show, as far as I remember, ended with a diary entry by Captain nitti. which prompted the question who was Captain nitti? Interestingly enough, it's a question that has never been asked before in the Long March of humankind from primeval swamps to Space Age fabulous. Nobody's ever wanted to know who exactly this Captain nitti person actually was. That should tell us something. But what it might tell us that Captain nity was an almost staggeringly insignificant figure. It might tell us that he never actually existed and his mere Figment. Now those figs, fig you and fig meant we're all familiar, I think from our picture books with fig one or fig a. Sometimes, depending on the nature of the book, a fig might be a plate. how much easier it would be to answer our question. If we had a fig or a plate depicting Captain nitti. If that were the case, we could simply pointed the picture and say there that is Captain nitti. And all curiosity, if indeed there were any would be satisfied, and we could go off and do something else something perhaps have more input, such as circumnavigating a duck pond or visiting an owl sanctuary. But just as nobody's ever cared to ask who Captain nitti was, nor has anybody ever bothered to depict him, whether in pen and ink or dorbz of paint, or by mechanical means, such as a camera or blocky scope. Even the noted mezzotint test Rex tent never made a mezzotint of Captain nitti possibly because nobody was ever prepared to pay the fat fee demanded by Rex tent for one of his mezzotints. In the absence of a fig or a plate, then how are we to go about answering the question? Is there a potted biography to which we might refer partied in this sense does not mean literally, that the biography is to be found planted in a pot? Like say, an Aspen district. We mustn't get in a muddle about all these figs and plates and pots. If we confuse them with actual figs, and actual plates and actual pots, our brains are likely to overheat as we struggle to comprehend what we're talking about. If such overheating does occur, and there are times when it does it does, then a circumnavigation of the duck pond or a visit to an owl sanctuary is a splendid coolant. Brain Julie cooled, however, we're still at something of a loss regarding Captain nitti as we have discovered to our horror, and that's not too strong a word that no potted biography of him exists. We want of course to realize this, for someone who have written a biography, potted or otherwise, they would first have had to ask the question, who was Captain nitti? or be it silently to themselves? And we already know that that is an unasked question. There are of course, innumerable other questions which have never been asked ever by anybody. How do you boil an ostrich head, for example? Or were the tears of St. Veronica used as a GM for postage stamps? We could Witter away until the cows come home, compiling a list of untold thousands of unasked questions. But to do so, would bring us no closer to knowing who Captain nitti was. Would it? Would they're spelled w o ULD. has the same pronunciation as would w double o d. But again, we must avoid getting all befuddled about wood. As with figs and plates and pots. Generally, we should always be on our guard against befuddlement. I should Coco.

Long time pooting yard listeners will already know that President Richard Milhouse Nixon had a love of mashed potatoes. Well, I'm not sure if he liked mashed potatoes. He liked mashing potatoes. He like the actual act of mashing them. But I presume he enjoyed eating them as well. And but now, thanks to Salim Fadhley, where you learn of Nixon's diametrically opposite view of soup. Mr. Fadhley pointed me to a passage from President Nixon alone in the White House by Richard Reeves, published in 2001. And I'll read it to you. On March the 24th 1969, the President hosted his first state dinner for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada. He complained to Haldeman about it the next morning. We've got to speed up these dinners. They take forever. So why don't we just leave out the soup course? Well, how the man began, Nixon cut him off. Men don't really like soup. On a hunch, the Chief of Staff called the President's valet, Manolo Sanchez, and asked, was there anything wrong with the President's suit after the dinner last night? Yes, he spilled soup down the vest. The action memo went out. No more soup ever.

Sorry about that slightly lengthy pause. I was getting befuddled myself by technology, but I'm alright now. I strode out shortly after daybreak to check my traps. I had set them up to have them on the edge of the woods. And as I approached in the Milky morning light, I was pleased to see that in each eye had ensnared a monster of duplicity. The duplicity of the first monster consisted of it having to head where you would expect to find only the one. Almost all beings with heads have just a single head perched on a single neck. And this trapped monster did indeed have a single neck, but at a certain point Excuse me, but at a certain point it bifurcated in order to support a pair of head adding to the monsters monster strati was the remarkable even nauseatingly disparity in the head. The one on the left was a smooth and Baldy head almost egg like when I was close enough to study its features, I saw that it had a pair of tiny piggy eyes and a miniscule snub of a nose and thin pinched lips. I saw no sign of ears, but the other head it was misshapen and hairy and disgusting, with several eyes and noses and more than one mouth and numerous is admitted a god awful grunting noise that sent shivers down its own spine, or rather, the spine it shared with it other head. I watched those shivers snaking up and down the recruiting spine with cold emotionless fascination. I knew I was going to kill the monster sooner or later. But first I turned my attention to my second trap and the second monster. Its duplicity was not a simple matter of having two heads, for it had just one and that not a particularly monstrous head. If anything, it was a rather handsome head ahead one might easily imagine topping the beautiful body of a young Apollo. Quite what kind of body the monster had was, however, a matter of conjecture. Evidently, when my trap snap shot it did so precisely upon the monster's neck, detaching the head from the body. Judging by the pawprint in the mud, the headless body had then fled, leaving the head lolling helpless, the severed neck caught in the fangs of the trap. It duplicity then, was that head and body could continue to exist, even to thrive separately. I pondered whether to follow the pawprint but saw that they terminated nearby where the body of the monster had plunged into the mash, the better to make it to scape. I thought the handsome head into my puppy bag and slung it over my shoulder. Then I bashed the heads of the other monster with my spayed, rendering it unconscious. I freed it from the trap and tied it up with Butcher's string and shoved it onto my cart. Before leaving the edge of the woods, I reset both traps. Other monsters roam these parts, and though I could trap only two at a time, I would never stint in my efforts.

Those of you who checks the resonance shedule online and the listings for each day will know that for about two weeks now, I've been promising to tell you all about the murderer, Erasmus Stribling trout shoo. And this week, eventually I'm actually going to get round to doing what I said I would do. This is an extract from Erasmus Stribling crowd shoes diary dated the 23rd of January 18 19th. Seven. Today I murdered my wife. I matched her windpipe and broke her neck which might seem an overreaction to the fact that she had not cooked any meat for my dinner. But then, as my first wife would tell you, I am a cruel and horrible and violent man. My second wife would probably say the same actually not died in mysterious circumstances shortly after our marriage. zona who I killed today was my third wife. I hope to have seven eventually. I won't get a chance to marry a further four wives if I'm hanged or imprisoned for murder. So I took various steps to cover my tracks. I laid zona out on the bed and dressed her in a high neck dress with a stiff collar and placed a veil over her face. When Dr. nap arrived to examine the corpse, I sobbed and wailed and cradled zoners head My hand that did the trick, and he didn't inspect her too closely, noting that her death was due to everlasting faint. So everything went according to plan, and I seem to be in the clear, free to find a fourth wife to terrorize and or kill. The worst that could happen is that Zola might appear as a ghost to her grieving mother and spill the beans and prove that I broke her neck by rotating her ghostly head in a full circle atop her ghostly body. But even if she does repeatedly over four nights, and zoners mother goes babbling her tail, an American court of law in the enlightened 1890s is not going to accept the testimony of a ghost. Is it? Well, actually, it did. The all the details of the murder of his wife by Erasmus Stribling trout show are genuine. But shortly after the death zone as ghosts did actually appear to her mother, and did rotate her head on her neck and zoners mother went babbling to the law and the law arrested Erasmus Stribling trout show. And he was tried for her murder on the basis of the testimony of a ghost.

On the same day in 1946, that Blodgett wrote those words. Another person and ignorant ornithologist, wrote as follows. I had arranged to spend the morning birdwatching with Dennis. So shortly after daybreak I met him as a rain that his hide. This is a small, low concrete pillbox at the edge of the marshes for within which one has a sweeping view, but cannot oneself be seen. I was very impatient to spot some birds. So no sooner had we made ourselves comfortable than I snatched Dennis's binoculars and peered through them. Gosh, I cried. A Marsh warbler. Really, said Dennis, let me take a look. And he snatched back the binoculars and peered through them. Then he emitted a great sigh, expressing all at once pity and exasperate motion, bafflement and resignation. cloth guard, he said, turning to look at me just because it's at a marsh and is making a warbling sound doesn't make it a marsh warbler. Look again, and he handed back the binoculars and tell me is it bear winged? Does it have a beak? Does it have feathers? I peered again, wrapped back had to confess that I was unable to see any of those telltale bird features. What you can see said dennis is not a marsh warbler, granted, it is a living thing at a marsh making little warbling sounds. But what in fact it is, is a little orphan child out roaming the marshes at daybreak, and warbling or singing tremulously. Perhaps because it's a naturally cheerful orphan, or more likely from a nerve wracking desire to drown out the eerie morning marshland sounds of Gaskin Creek and slosh. Hark now to the words of the little orphans warbled song, and you will gather why he is a feared. I picked up my ears and listened carefully tralala Trulli, sometimes I warble and sometimes I soak. I hope I'm not accosted by an escaped convict from the Hulk. And sure enough, as I watched, I saw the orphan of a sudden accosted by a theist bedraggled, trained clanking convict, newly escaped from a Hulk mod out beyond the marshes. He bought a distinct resemblance to the Scottish act of Finley curry. Gosh, I said, a castle worry. Dennis thumped me on the head with a brick.

Film buffs will have noted the reference to great expectations, the David lean version there, and another film, another film may just be called to mind in the following piece, which is the diary of Papa kucera. From the 26th of January 1905 fue. What a day, I went out in the morning to inspect the medical facilities in this small Carolien village. And quite frankly, I wouldn't trust them in my wife is heavily pregnant. And I'm not convinced that giving birth here is a good idea. So I made a snap decision that we should go to a hospital in Vienna. No sooner had the train chugged out of the little village station. Then my wife went into labor, and our daughter was born before we ever arrived at the imperial capital. Once I was assured the baby was whole and healthy. I sloped off to the smoking carriage to light up a celebrator a cigar. It was there. I was accosted by some sort of Tyrolean Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman, all bangles and scarves and with piercing blue eyes. Cross my palm with Austrian currency. She intoned, and I shall reveal to you what the future holds for your daughter, who has just been born aboard this train. I rummaging the pocket of my Tyrolean jacket for a few shillings and press them into outstretched hand. All at once her countenance grew horribly grim. And I feared the worst for my infant. The Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. Read my thoughts. Don't worry about your daughter, she said. You need not dash back along the train corridor to be at her side. Sit back and enjoy your cigar. Know, the horrible grimness of my countenance is occasioned not by your daughter's fate, but by yours, and that of your good wife. For the pair of you will both be dead seven years hence. And your daughter and orphan shall be cast into a nunnery but there shall cause great trouble and vexation and the Mother Superior will be at her wit's end to know what to do with her. She will be ejected from the convent to take up a position as a governess to the seven tiny children of a widow, a Baron, a Baron, who will bear a striking resemblance to the has yet unborn Canadian actor Christopher Plummer. Among the highlights of his career will be his portrayal of wallpaper in the Royal hands of the son. And your daughter will Where did this Baron and teach the Chinese to sing their little hearts out on concert stages across Australia. But then a darkness will descend upon the land in the form of bad bad Nazis and your daughter and the Baron and their singing nipples will flee across the mountains in the night and eventually end up in the United States of America. And showbiz legend. That's all very interesting. I said, contemplating my imminent or imminent death. But Pray tell me more about this. After helper fell on the train screeched into a tunnel and the light went out. And when we emerged I was all alone in the smoking carriage. The seat the Tyrolean Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman had occupied opposite was now empty, but for a sprig of Edelweiss.

Very, very quickly before the end of the show, I'm going to read you a little rhyme written by a hallucinating hospital inpatient in Hoon, not to be confused, confused with Chris keune. This is Hoon, H double and I woke up this morning with a head full of verse. And at once I called out to the stationery nurse, bring me pencil and paper and prayed and delay for I have significant things I must say. In my dreams. I've had thought insights, both deep and poetic. But the nurse dosed me up with a powerful emetic, and I vomited my breakfast before I've even eaten. A Splurge or eggy and brandy and Wheaton. lie back, said the nurse. Let your raving cease. You are in the throes of a terrible disease. That's why you're in hospital, You foolish clot and she felt my forehead and my forehead was hot. But where is my pencil and Where is my daughter? I cried as my forehead grew hotter and hotter. Then doctors swept in and prodded my head and I let out a grown and sank back on the bed. But inside my brain the vs came teaming of Zainab Badawi and afford and Jan Leeming of television, newsreaders no longer seen reading the news on the television screen. Reginald Bo's uncut, often drunken and earthy, where now we have bumptious Krishnan, Guru Murthy. Then my head emptied out and I fell into swoon in my hospital bed in the clinic and who saw the world must cope somehow without my verse. Is that a blessing? Or is it a curse? A blessing for sure. Set of voices stern and grim. You're not Dennis beer pint. You just think you're him? I woke. It was true. I'm not beer pint at all. I turned the gaze at the white clinic wall. Then the nurse announced it was time for my boss. By the way, she said, nor are you Sylvia Plath.
