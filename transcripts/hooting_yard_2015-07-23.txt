Excuse me Hello, my name is Frankie. This is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. Coming to you live, unless you're listening to a repeat, or the podcast. Sorry, I wasn't here last week I was. I was I had an attack of the vapors, but some kind of Victorian woman. You know, Victorian women were always falling, falling foul of the vapors. Well, I had the vapors and was able to make it to the studio. But I'm back now. And the big news is that I've decided to devote my life to birdsong. Now, not that kind of bird song. All those trills and squawks and tweets and cheer ups and cores and cooing noises that birds make. I mean, songs about birds. I haven't quite worked everything out in my head. But the general idea is to make is to take familiar songs, not originally about birds, and to tweak the lyrics to make them more bird focused. I feel this would provide an invaluable musical service for both humans and birds. So, as an example, here's the first fruit of my project. I've taken the lyrics of a of a popular song and I think you'll agree that the revised version of it is superior in every way. Particularly from a North a logical point of view. Obviously, our Valley got the lyrics I can't do the whole performance, but I think you'll get the general idea. Heaven loves here. The clouds part for you. Nothing stands in your way when you're a grebe plumage regales Yeah, life is a pop of the cherry when you're agreed. When you're agreed, you can soar through the air when you're agreed.

It was a gorgeous day of overcast skies and drizzle and a keen wind and I set out early in stout boots with a puppy bag over my shoulder whistling a tune I remembered from childhood such as it was learned I think from the orphanages British overseer who liked to sing the song as he made us dip into puddles and fossick first squelchy riving horas vile water worms and other beings which we collected in our piles for him and the orphan with the highest tally was rewarded with an extra helping gruul Oh Happy Days. We never found out what the brute did with all those aquatic creepy crawlies. But at night, as we tossed and turned in our ion cots in the attic, we whispered stories to each other, making up tales about the brute and his pails full of the worms we caught for him. It was only later, when I was grown and had long left the orphanage that I learned, he sold them to a scientist at the sinister secret laboratory along the lane on the other side of the viaduct, as he sold and often or to from time to time when funds were low, or he lost his temper. It was on that gorgeous day that I retraced my steps past the shattered and abandoned orphanage and along the line and through the wicked gate we had been forbidden to cross in the old days, and I carried on under the viaduct and pass the shuttered and abandoned laboratory, past the ice cream kiosk and the duck pond on past the gasworks and the aerodrome, and the cement statue of Condoleezza Rice with 1000 nightingales until last, the sky more overcast. The drizzle heavier, the wind Keener, I came to the big stone gates of the Mersey home I rang the bell. It clanked and anon kinda let me in. Her Wimpole was filthy. I stated my business and she led me across the gravel and around the main building, and pass the vegetable patches and the gazebo to a hut, almost hidden in vegetation and or I take the nada corn from my pocket, and she gambled away singing, I noted the very same song I had been whistling all along day. I stood outside the hat and eased my puppy bag from my shoulder, then took from it a sealed jar. inside the jar, squirming in a quantity of puddle water, with dozens of squelchy riding horas vile water worms and other beings which I had collected for the retired brute. I cease to whistle and pushed open the door of the heart. I had come to make my weekly offering.

I was absolutely delighted to discover that the Natural History Museum has a live online 24 seven baby cam where you can look at the bees in a hive in the garden of the Natural History Museum. All day long and all night long should you so wish. If you there's a link, there's not a link on the hooting yard website where there isn't the dabbler or you can just put B cam or BB cam natural history museum and tell your search engine. Anyway, I was delighted to discover this. But delight soon turned to despair when I realized that I'm unlikely ever again to concentrate on any purposeful activity. Give to give you an idea of what I mean I've been keeping a log I'm here is a typical day in my new world. 5:15am leap out of bed and plump myself in front of the beat can become in Thrall. 7:24am consider basic needs such as washing and dressing and eating a hearty breakfast of kedgeree and bloaters and smokers pop tart but I'm so overwhelmed by the B cam that I postpone any activity 11:45am be haunted three o'clock pm. numb to the human World beginning to think like a bee making occasional buzzing noises 3:14pm nip away from the bee cam momentarily to Donna yellow and black striped leotard and black hat with antenna 7:52pm recall that I planned to write something to read on my radio show on resonance FM and to transfixed by the B cam to move 11:35pm realized that I have spent the entire day observing either bees or the absence of bees on the bee cam suffused with a warm glow of Venus. Continue to watch bees with now bleary eyes make a mental note to explain to listeners that bleary eyed has nothing to do with Blair right and labour politician Hazel Blears, though Come to think of it. She is so diminutive. She's not much bigger than a be 1:07am drag myself reluctantly from be cam to bed. As I fall asleep, reflect upon the fact that I have never had so be centered a day as the day just gone, resolved to be even more in future.

Apart from staring a BS and making up songs about birds or not making up songs, but tweaking existing songs, the other thing I've been doing and without wanting to be morbid. I've been wondering from time to time how I might conduct myself at the pearly gates of heaven. When far into the future. I hope I kicked the bucket. It's prudent to be as well prepared as one can one can be for an event which is after all inevitable. Some people don't care to think of such things or think they're tempting fate by doing so. But I don't give a fig for superstitions. I'm sorry, I'm preparing for my appointment. Just as I might prepare for a friendly chinwag with a Jesuit priest. That is very, very carefully in case I come a Cropper theologically or otherwise. Listeners might be interested by the way in my forthcoming pamphlet, top tips for talking to priest available soon. It's occurred to me for example, but it would probably be an error to satisfy up to the pearly gates, losing self confidence and braggadocio. having read an exemplary lot and exemplary really. I cannot say that having led an exemplary life of almost unimaginable piety, at least so far, I would be entirely justified in doing so. In other words, using self confidence. But it's best not to pull push your luck in these circumstances. At the same time, crawling upon my belly like a worm or thing that creepeth upon the face of the earth would be overdoing the humility just a tad. Having to strike the right note. I tussled with this question, until I came across a master class from retired us Lieutenant General William Boykin. He was addressing a conference of apocalyptic Christian Zionists in April 2008. And he certainly a man who knows how to present himself before the Almighty. This is what he said. Here's the why I want to show up at the gates of heaven. I want to come skidding in there on all fours. I want to be slipping and sliding, and I want to hit the gates of heaven with a bang. And when I stand up, when I stand before Christ, I want there to be blood on my knees and my elbows. I want to be covered in mud. And I want to be standing there with a ragged breastplate of righteousness or a spear in my hand and I want to say Look at me, Jesus. I've been in the battles I've been fighting for you

see? See if you will the king's custard crown, burnished and gleaming, made from metal so soft. You could mold it like marzipan though betide you if you put your hand anywhere near it. When it's a top that kingly head he'll hack two fingers off and shove them one each into your ears muffling all sound, as happened, alas, to my Spry confrere nifi por nifi, languishing Deaf now in the king's donjon and all for his thoughtless prodding from mere curiosity, that custard crown there's a sprig of Larkspur on the Don John's outer wall, and on all souls I'll pluck a Bowden wave it as a nose guy for all the good that will do pour nity I plead his case with the hoity toity Chamberlains, and they're scribbling beetles, booted callow Murgatroyd with pig eyes, not one of them are true prints, cushioned against fate, smacking their lips, oh, all at sixes and sevens aboard the boat of state. I tried my own clambering aboard it once in spring drawn tea fabric kept in gorgeous hues, but was repelled with sticks and fists and cut jewelry, bloodied and battered and half ground I was afterwards sprawled ashore in my pumps, like a water devil. Snip snip the ties loose and away it went following on green out of my sight. Me sloshed in build an offer nitti. Now step one, two and cup brisk capers and you will see the custard crown Oh, bright, gleaming, but now no longer in bonsai upon the kingly head. No. Whipple wills and shoma dines came sweeping in and snatched it away and carried it into a darkling cave and then the lumpy bumpy banks and landing of the Lake nitti has his army in exile here. custard colored like the crown, pranked swift but so disputatious, like Jabba frenzies all the live long day and terrible night and scares can boil an egg for their supper. so caught up are they in their rebab massive who do they might be ENT the kingma like a fell Doc's still in his Paris keep dab that we're going by his shadow line, his Russian plimsolls hardly showed on his great Titanic enormous feet dangling over the end of the pilot. Up Up King Bird chatter on the windows cell. There is lively sparring yet in this kingdom, jack mcglue and all his train cannot lift the long hoist cannot lift the king hoist though they try with pulleys and contractions of fabled strength, custard crownless his life ends while below in the donjon nitti waggles the severed fingers plugging his ears and jumps through spirit hoops in dank darkness. And now his army is on the march beside the railings with their banners and their pipe tooting cacophonous and swallows information flying over their horrible shrunken, withered heads. That zombie army of knitties conjuration in rags and tatters, found with sweat, swords rusted, as implacable in their progress as a swordfish spearing through the deep marching Clanton jangle on the palace, the collapsing palace perched on its promontory and crumbling bit by Beth into the sea. I plucked another bottle of Larkspur and waved it as a nose guy and tested the wind the Women bees coming in. There is yet an empire to be flattened.

Silent monkey is an anagram of Milton Keynes silent monkey is also the name of a fictional ape, the mute monkey hero of a series of fat doorstopper novels, written as it happened by my distant relative mo linnets K. For the record, such as the distance of our cousin age that I have never met Mo, I'm not entirely sure whether mo is short for a male Muhammad or Malka, Mora female, Maureen or Marjorie nor indeed, why he or she has attracted the nickname limits. What I do know is that the silent monkey books are bestsellers, flying off the shelves of airport bookstores, earning my distant cousin, untold millions. The basic premise of the series is that the silent monkey itself is a sort of ratty rat iOS ratty alternative detective Allah Sherlock Holmes or sola Pons or Prince zaleski. Unlike these fictional human detectives, it's a fictional monkey detective. And as if to underline it to monkey Enos, it spends much of its time swinging from bow to bow in the Milton Keynes tree Cathedral. Moe's incredibly detailed descriptive passages on the tree Cathedral lead one to think that he or she has spent many many hours in the shade of its trees, wrapped in diligent study, and is probably in possession of an advanced qualification in arboreal science. Indeed, one can learn much more from the book about trees than one can about monkeys. one learns to about Milton Keynes, including the startling and rather unexpected information that the town when built, was quite deliberately aligned with the angle of the sun in the sky on Midsummer's day. It thus has a certain Wicker Man resonance, for knowledge of which is very helpful if one pays a visit and finds calls to ponder the eerie nature of its citizenry. There is perhaps less eeriness in the silent monkey books than one might expect or hope for. They're highly formulaic, though, who can blame Moe for sticking to a formula which has proved dizzyingly successful. Having skim read my way through the cannon, I'm able to offer the following summary of a typical silent monkey book. Chapter one, we're introduced to the silent monkey swinging from bow to bow in the Milton Keynes tree Cathedral. Usually, there will be excessively detailed tree descriptions. They'll be too carefully aimed at the general reader rather than the tree specialist. Chapter Two, somewhere in Milton Keynes, a crime is committed. Often though not always, a murder of peculiar savagery will have occurred so that one imagines the town to be as littered with corpses as Inspector morss, Oxford, the police dem which all scratch their heads in consternation. CHAPTER THREE a person tangentially involved with the crime goes to the tree Cathedral to consult the silent monkey queue much more tree description chapter four gratuitous passages of civic Milton Keynes puffery chapter five, the silent monkey ratty austinites. Given that the original the signal characteristic of the silent monkey is that it is silent, it ratiocination is hinted at, rather than made explicit in fine descriptions of it swinging from bow to bow. Chapter Six, a second crime is committed in Milton Keynes. It is, of course, directly related to the first but in a thoroughly bewildering manner. The police scratch their heads again. Chapter Seven, the person from chapter three or possibly someone else entirely goes to the tree Cathedral to tell the silent monkey of the new development. The scene usually takes place at lunch On and we're given valuable insight into the silent monkeys not based diet. There is often an extended passage about one particular type of knot.

Chapter Eight, while swinging from bow to bow in the tree Cathedral, after a postprandial nap, the silent monkey rats he also needs to take account of the new information given in the previous chapter. Chapter nine, a few choice morsels from the Civic history of Milton Keynes. Chapter 10. The criminal or villain there's new order to the tree Cathedral by fair means or foul. The least dim witted of the police officers happens to be there. After some flowery descriptive prose about some of the trees not previously mentioned. The Silent monkey leap from a bow onto the head of the villain and the police officer snaps on the handcuffs and places them under arrest. The Silent monkey then leaped back up into the trees and swings from bow to bow. Chapter 11. The entire plot including any loose ends and wild improbabilities is tied up just in time for dawn to break on Midsummer's day. And the startling and rather unexpected alignment of Milton Keynes with the angle of the sun in the sky is revealed. And yeah, that's actually true about the alignment of Milton Keynes. It's also true that there is a tree Cathedral, which I thoroughly recommend. Should you find yourself in Milton Keynes, no one in Milton Keynes knows where it is, which is weird. If you if you ask Milton Keine Zeit they just look at you blankly so you have to kind of track it down. But it was based entirely on the on the What am I thinking of where he's got the same floor plan as Norwich Cathedral. Except it's entirely composed of trees and well worth a visit. And if you keep your eyes peeled, we might see the silent monkey. Although he is fictional. I think that's it for this week. Bye bye.
