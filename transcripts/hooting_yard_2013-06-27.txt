Your tune to resonance 104 point four FM, the art of listening.

Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com or SoundCloud, or a podcast that you're listening to many moons in the future. Yes, my name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you. One of the things I read to you last week was an extract from Andrey McKenzie Bacon's book, from 1870, on the writing of the insane. And in that extract, I pointed out it was it was Dr. Mackenzie bacon, pointing out the similarity between the writing of the insane and the writing of the poor, and the lower orders. I was gonna offer a quiz at this point, but I've just realized that the preamble kind of tells you the answer. Here is another extract. The patient was a respectable artist and have considerable intelligence, and were sent to the Cambridge asylum. After being nearly three years in a melancholy mood. He spent much of his time in writing, sometimes versus at others long letters of the most rambling character, and in drawing extraordinary diagrams. After he left the asylum, he went to work at his trade. But some two or three years later, he began to write very strangely again. This is one of the letters he wrote at this time, after a visit from a medical man who tried to dissuade him from writing in this way. Dear doctor, to write, or not to write, that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to follow the visit of the great fool born with chronic melancholy expressions of regret withheld when he was here, that as the fights would have it, we were so little prepared to receive Him, and to Vince my humble desire to do honor to visit my full bondstar but an instant seen like a meteors flash, a blank when gone. The dust of ages covering my little sanctum parlor room, the available drapery to greet the doctor stowed away through the midst of the regenerating water and scrubbing cleanliness next to godliness, political and spiritual cleansing a volatile world. The great physician walked be dimmed by the Dark Ages, the long passage of Western enterprise, leading to the curvatures of rising Eastern mourn. The rounded configuration of Luna ticks garden lives and a shadow bent on britannias vortex.

In the course of another year, he had some domestic troubles which upset him a good deal, and he ended by drowning himself one day in a public spot. The peculiarity was that he could work well and not attract public attention. While he was in his leisure moment, writing the most incoherent nonsense.

Frank Key  04:21
I think there's a lot to be said for spending hours writing incoherent nonsense. But then I would wouldn't die. Last time I bumped into a ragged trousered philanthropist in the street. I berated him for his disheveled moment. Would it not be meat, I suggested were he to pay more attention to his toilet? I held before his eyes, the image of Beau Brummell as an exemplar of attention to detail in masculine dress. Do you think for one minute I chemed that brahmo would ever have stepped out of doors. Wearing ragged trousers. But Brummell was not a philanthropist countered the ragged trousered philanthropists and he pressed a coin into my palm. I realized he had mistaken me for a mendicant. It is true that my own apparel was somewhat raggedy, but I can admire by Brahma without attempting to emulate him. Here, have your coinage back, I said, I have no need of it. I'm grateful swine. shouted the philanthropist, and he slapped my face. The slap was done with his bare hand. Had it been a glove, I would have taken it as a challenge to engage in a duel. As he refused to take back his coin, I tossed it into the gutter. Like a gun guttersnipe profit from your philanthropy, I said, rubbing my cheek. I know why I promised in the bitter sunshine. At the corner I paused and turned and waited until we ragged trousered philanthropists was out of sight. Then I hastened back to retrieve the coin from the gutter. Before I could do so, however, an eagle eyed guttersnipe, attracted by its silvery glint, appeared from nowhere and scooped it up. I brandished my stick and beat the urge in insensible I prize the coin from his grasp, and then rifled through his filthy pockets to find what treasures are lay there in string, elastic bands, paper clips, a boiled sweet, but no more coinage. I left the guttersnipe battered and bloody in the gutter, and went on my way, in the bitter sunshine. An exercise to do following that piece, the narrator is clearly wallowing in a moral sewer. describe this sewer as vividly as you are able, and populated with other figures, both historical and fictional, who you think are likely to be found there?

Frank Key  08:05
Excuse me. And one fictional character who I don't think we could ever accuse of wallowing in a moral sewer is Bartleby the Scrivener. From Herman Melville's 1853 story of that name. Bartleby is one of the most numinous characters in literature. Though fictional, he's always seemed to me to be a role model, a man to emulate if we wish to live a better life. handily for those of us seeking to be Bartleby. There's the estimable estimable john per tack, a website called pretax science books, has gathered into a single list all the separate utterances of our hero. Armed with this list, we can confine our own speech to the words and phrases spoken by Bartleby the Scrivener, and I'm going to read them to you but you'll note how splendidly appropriate they are, to almost every conceivable situation. So this is every word spoken by Bartleby. In Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener I would prefer not to. I would prefer not to. Was he's wanted I would prefer not to. I would prefer not to. I prefer not to. I prefer not to. I would prefer not to I prefer not. I would prefer not to I would prefer not to At present, I prefer to give no answer. At present, I would prefer not to be a little reasonable. I would prefer to be left alone here. No more. Do you not see the reason for yourself? I have given up copying. I would prefer not. I'm very sorry, sir. sitting upon the banister. No, I would prefer not to make any change. There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like a clock ship. But I'm not particular. I would prefer not to take a clock ship. I would not like it at all though. As I said before, I'm not particular. No, I would prefer to be doing something else. Not at all. It does not strike me that there is anything definite about that. I like to be stationary. But I'm not particular. No present I would prefer not to make any change at all. I know you and I want nothing to say to you. I know where I am. I prefer not to dine today. It would disagree with me. I am unused to dinners.

I keep all my eggs in one basket. I have several baskets obtained during what I like to think of as my basket acquiring years, but there's only one in which I put my eggs. This is a small oval wicker basket a bit taffy with age, which I keep on one side of the countertop in my kitchen. My other baskets I use for a number of different purposes in different parts of the house and outside. one purpose to which they're never ever put is for the keeping of eggs. The eggs always go in their designated basket.

Frank Key  13:02
I usually buy half a dozen eggs at one time. Invariably, they come packaged in a cardboard egg carton, specifically designed for the storage of eggs. Some people are happy to leave the eggs in the carton once they get them home. That's their choice. And it's not one with which I would argue unless I was in a frantic and fractious frame of mind. And at the end of my tether, looking for a pretext to blow my top and indulge in a violent argument. Shouting my head off about the pros and cons of different eggs storage possibilities can be a splendid way to let off steam. In general though, I tolerate the practice of leaving the eggs in the carton you brought them in. So long as my own preference for putting my eggs in a basket is accepted in return usually is. It would be a mistake to think that six is the maximum number of eggs in my basket. I make it my habit to buy a new carton of eggs when there's still one egg or even two in the basket. Thus, the maximum number is seven or eight. When adding the newly bought half dozen eggs, what I do is to remove temporarily the one or two eggs remaining in the basket. Put the fresh eggs in carefully and then place the one or two older eggs even more carefully on top of the clutch. If I did not do this, the same one or two eggs will always remain at the bottom and might never get used and they would rot from the inside. unbeknown to me until such time as I cracked the shell and released an Astra ball. lovecraftian stent

Frank Key  15:03
Placing the one or two older eggs atop the clutch is not without risk of course. When removing them temporarily from the basket, I cannot simply place them on the countertop. If I were to do that they might being egg shaped, roll all the way off the countertop and smashed up on the floor. mopping up egg innards and shattered shell is never a pleasant business. That's I first lay out a tea towel on the countertop, and put the older eggs on that to avert any rolling. It has been suggested that I might temporarily placed the older eggs in one of my other baskets. superficially attractive as that may be. I load the very idea. As I insisted at the outset, I like to keep my eggs in one basket. One great advantage of my system is that I have an empty egg carton to muck about with judicious use of scissors and paint and glue can transform the carton into a few hats for gnomes. There are lots of other things you can do with empty egg cartons of course, but that's the one I always returned to. My gnomes are always losing their hats in high winds. Now, a terrible thing happened last week. I was at a Swiss cocktail party leaning insouciantly against the mantle piece. When I heard above the hubbub, a snatch of conversation. One of the guests in a voice as strident as a corncrakes said, Well, you know what they say never keep all your eggs in one basket. It's hard to describe the effect these words had on me. They came with the force of a thunderclap. I felt unmoored from all it was familiar. All I held dear. All I knew they who were they who said this, with such confidence, such authority, steadying myself against the mantlepiece, I stood on tiptoe, craning my neck to peer over the heads of the partygoers trying to see who it was who would said these awful hideous words. There could be only one culprit, he sounded like a corncrake. And he looked like a corncrake. And now he was saying something about not counting chickens. I clutched at the mantlepiece, fearing I would swoon. No man should be allowed to live who could utter such things. My head throbbing, I felt in my pocket for my stiletto. Damn, it was not there. panicked, I rummaged in my other pockets in vain. Then I remembered that I've left my still at home in one of my other baskets, the big blood soaked one, the one in which I keep my stilettos and my knives and my hatchet and my axes and my slices and my shins.

The source of that piece was me and my eggs by the lumbering walrus mustache psychopathic serial killer babinski.

Frank Key  19:12
babinski is a little memoir about his eggs he mentions an unalterable, lovecraftian stench. And so it seems, seems appropriate at this moment to bring in a bit of HP Lovecraft himself. This is HP Lovecraft the organic things, Italo submitted Mongoloid, inhabiting that awful cesspool could not by any stretch of the imagination be called human. They were monstrous and nebulous at abrasions of the Pathak anthropoid and an evil vaguely molded from some stinking viscous slime of Earth corruption. slithering and oozing in and on the filthy streets, or in and out of windows and doorways, in a fashion suggestive of nothing but infesting worms, or deep sea unnamed abilities. They have a degenerate gelatinous fermentation of which they were composed, seemed to ooze seep and trickle through the gaping cracks in the horrible houses. And I thought of some avenue of cyclopean and unwholesome vac crammed to the vomiting point with gangrenous vileness and about to burst and inundate the world in one leprosy Cataclysm of semi fluid rottenness. From that nightmare of perverse infection, I could not carry away the memory of any living face. The individually grotesque was lost in the collectively devastating, which left on the eye, only the broad phantasmal lineaments of the morbid mold of disintegration and decay, a yellow and varying mask with sour sticky acid it cause oozing at eyes, ears, nose and mouth, and abnormally bubbling from monstrous and unbelievable sores at every point. That's not one of HP Lovecraft imagined worlds. That's him describing a visit to the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In a letter he wrote to Frank Belknap along. I posted that on on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org. And one of my correspondents in the comments said, what was that was that self parody or insane racism? Well, given HP Lovecraft wasn't really given to self parody. I think we can only conclude that it was insane racism.

Frank Key  23:04
I'm still here. I'm just trying to find the next thing I wanted to read to you. Is I have just come upon it. Yes. So HP Lovecraft. Not really a happy soul. But one of the things that that has been said is that it was his it was in fact this this kind of demented loading of everyone who wasn't like him that created his dreaminess or really more from where his genius sprang. I don't know. But anyway, Interesting. Interesting. I've been to every side, and I didn't describe it like that. But then I'm not HP Lovecraft. I put some sphagnum in a pot. I boiled it till it was hot. I spooned it out onto a plate. And then I sat me down to wait. I waited till the moss was cold. I did precisely as I'd been told in a book of recipes for Spagna meals, dining well on moss and eels. Rather, a pamphlet, not a book by Dobson, who claimed to be a cook in the preparatory piece he'd written to these recipes. that poem by FX erg is the sole reference in all world literature to Dobson's semi mythical recipe book. The Titanic pamphleteer of the 20th century, always denied having written it, and not even the most indefatigable of Dobson list has been able to find any trace of it in either printed or manuscript form. It would just be simple to dismiss the time as one of FX erg lurid fantasies, were it not the Dobson is on The record is having eaten both Spagna moss and eels for breakfast on innumerable occasions in his pamphlet, a tally of all the breakfast cider tucked into over the past 16 years out of print. Dobson regularly mentions fragment eels, sometimes in con combination, as in this extract 15th of June 1954. breakfast today was eels stuffed with boiled and shredded sphagnum washed down with dandelion and burdock spiked with runny egg. It is quite plausible then that the out of print pamphleteer might at some point have turned his hand to such a recipe book. But if he did, why did he so vehemently deny it? And his denials were certainly vehement or hot in purpled, face spitting, screeching and the jabbing his fist. At his interlocutor were common responses whenever Dobson was asked about the existence of the book, Russell hearty plus for one. Why, so he steered clear of the topic when he interviewed Dobson for an episode of his TV series, interviews with pamphleteers contenting himself with questions about hot air balloons, moles and gas giants, the subject of Dobson the three most recent pamphlets, or now out of print. An answer to the puzzle possibly lies in ferreting out further information about the lurid fantasist f x erg. This could prove problematic however, as the poem I read above, is the only known trace of him in all World Literature.

We don't have a lot of time left but I think we do have time for the village wrestler. At midday, Christian pungent, the village wrestler took up his position by the war memorial, which is aggressive stature and tiny brain. He challenged everyone passing by to a wrestling bout, but not one among the villages was full enough to fight him. And so in his frustration, he would fling himself upon a dog or a chicken, or a defenseless toddler straying from his mother's apron strings, and wrestle them to the ground and pin them they're counting to 10 in all four grunts, and then stand up arms raised aloft in victory. He was the undefeated champ when eventually the sheriff shot him, shot into him a dart tip with a powerful horse tranquilizer, and he killed over bashing his head on the war memorial. He laid their unconscious for days that really just debated what to do with him when he awoke, chains and cages were suggested, as was electroconvulsive therapy. But then, when you did awake, the village Dressler was planted, all aggressions spent. He took a chicken and a flask of water drawn from the village trough, and he wandered off along the line that led to the aerodrome. We never saw him again. And that is the end of the show now. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week with or without HP Lovecraft in our home Melville. Bye bye.
