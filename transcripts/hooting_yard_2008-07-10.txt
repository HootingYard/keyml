I'm gonna read to you for half an hour. Normally, or not, normally, but often I end the program with a quotation from another writer. This week I'd like to begin with a quotation from another writer. This is for this is the writer AJ Cruz. France still produces abominable sulfurous state made matches the manufacturer of matches being a state monopoly. The label designs are sometimes poor and the coloring crude. One of the earliest German labels issued in 1835 illustrates by drawing how to ignite the match by rubbing it on the box. Even the most ignorant person knew how to light a match, under label appears a very futile one. And that's from AJ Cruz's excellent book, matchbox labels of the world with a history of fire making appliances from primitive man to the modern match, together with a history of the world of labels from 1946. And I'd like to thank Ed Baxter for drawing that to my attention. And by coincidence, the phrase abominable, sulfurous and fue tile is the exact wording used by Blodgett whenever he's asked his opinion of ducks. Blodgett hate ducks Skoda or chavela, merganser, or teal, he loads them all. It's important to point out that this is not a phobia and irrational fear, but rather a conscious, reasoned hatred. Though the reasoning itself is flawed, as is Blodgett reasoning and pretty much every area of life safer matters of railway timetabling. And even then, his tendency to measure the speed of trains in nautical knots has led to all sorts of problems. But that's a topic for another time. I've already set aside this coming October for some thorough research into Blodgett on the railways. Blodgett himself has always insisted that he hates ducks because ducks hate him. The evidence for this appears to be that as a small child, he was attacked by a masked gaggle of red crested pop shards of the edge of a pond into which he was innocently tossing pebbles. So let's examine that claim in some detail. We need I think, to ask some hard questions. Where was this pond? Was it truly a pond, rather than say, a puddle, or accom, or a town or Amir or a lake or even the edge of a mighty an unknown sea. As for the pebbles, where they indeed pebbles are where they dangerously large rocks with very sharp edges that could slice through the neck of a passing pot yard or smooth by his own account. Blodgett with Amir taught when this incident took place. So how do you learn to distinguish between different types of duck? What sort of pedagogy would teach infants to identify teal, before they learn to read and write and count and tell the time and tie their shoelaces in a duck strewn domain of course, such methods may make sense. But from what we know of the land where Blodgett was raised, we can safely say that its duck population was average and unremarkable. The same is true of its ponds and pond like bodies of water, tallies of which were and still are kept by pond counting persons employed by the local potentate. Make no mistake, pond counting used to be an honorable profession, one to which any citizen possessed of good eyesight, sturdy limbs, and possession of a notch stick could aspire blog, its own mother trained as a pond counter, but a promising career was curtailed when she choked on a pip and came down with a van bronkhorst syndrome.

Getting back to those pebbles for a moment, what is the truth of Blodgett claim that he was tossing them into the pond innocently, one does not need to believe Leaving the doctrine of original sin to be aware that oftentimes, tiny children carry out acts of the most grievous moral turpitude. And though we may have difficulty grasping exactly what goes on in the brains of a gaggle of pot child's it surely not beyond our wit to consider that for a duck, the tossing of pebbles into a pond could be seen as an act of brute destruction. The Psychology of ducks may not be a subject on the curriculum of the standard infant community hub. But if the tinies are taught to tell the difference between between a smooth and a merganser, might they not also be given a grounding in the hopes and fears, the joys and terrors of these aquatic birds? That we need also to ask what sort of education the young Blodgett was given? If we're to ascertain the truth of his claims? Are we to assume it was skewed in favor of the study of ducks? And if so, what would account for such an idiosyncratic approach? We all know that there are pedagogues with manias, obsessions and tunnel vision. The deranged tutor is a staple of a certain type of fiction. One thing's for example of the sinister schoolmaster Wiens in the 1907 potboiler, the sinister schoolmaster Wiens by peverel grease box, or frankly batty Provost of the Cathedral School in Archibald clubs long running cereal for the Dotty capers for boys comic. Did the top Blodgett fall into the clutches of such a nutcase? Or could it be that his own childhood memories were filtered through his readings of grease box on glob, if indeed he ever did read them? If he spent so much time learning about ducks, when Could he have learned to read in the first place? By asking such questions, we begin to pick away at Blodgett tail, casting doubt on it. And do I need to explain why to do so is of such vital importance. The man is a scoundrel and a rogue, not in a likeable gap tooth din mustachioed Terry Thomas manner, but in a way far more damaging to our national fabric. Remember that Blodgett has tried his utmost to appear on flags and postage stamps, and even on Conan age, he would have us believe he's a model of probity. He likes to be seen on horseback at parades wearing a helmet with feathers. The airbags in certain makes of car bear his imprimatur. And most recently, he's had no fewer than five different soups named after him. These power crazed shenanigans have to be curbed. For if Blodgett ever gets a toehold on power, I fear for the future of our country's ducks. He's a spiteful man. Already, it seems we're in danger of losing our bees. Let us make sure we keep our ducks

in addition to abominable, sulfurous and futile another phrase that I used in a story requires comment in a piece entitled, hunched among the shimmer rings, which I read two weeks ago, I think. I mentioned an industrial funnel manufacturing compound. And I received a letter from our which said, I wonder if Mr. Key would be kind enough briefly to clarify about the industrial funnel manufacturing compound? Is this a manufacturing compound where industrial funnels are brought into being? Or is it rather an industrial manufacturing compound whose output happens to be funnels? Less I seem to be splitting hairs. I should perhaps add that the former instance might well be a case of two amiable widows occasionally meeting in let's suppose a disused pig pen or similar compounds, where they dissolve or really pop a few more rivets into their long lives work a single immense funnel of statuesque and sturdy conception, whereas the latter case might imply a colossal foundry or other such satanic installation, which turns out in their 10s of thousands minute funnels of such a definitively non industrial caliber that they buckle or actually with a dust under the mere weight of the potential customer's scrutiny and are are is quite right to draw attention to the ambiguity. And so I'm happy to clarify that the industrial funnel manufacturing compound to which I referred was indeed a disused pig pen wearing two widows pop rivets into a single immense funnel. I'm glad we've cleared that one up, which means we can move on now to the next piece, and which is called a man of parts. He was a man of parts. He was a slobbering and syphilitic whoremonger, who could yet charm the birds from the sky. Often when leaning against a mantel piece at a Swiss cocktail party, like Eric satty, he liked to eat sausages and camphor. His neck movements were sometimes like those of a vulture and sometimes like those of the sadly extinct giant short faced bear. When out and about on his so called patrols. He usually wore a crushed crumpling cravat, and a super abundance of brazen jet cufflinks, each one of which he polished vigorously with swore fieger the distribution of so many unnecessary cufflinks about his person was a wonder to behold and was regularly remarked upon by fashion mavens, but never copied when he wore a hat, he wore it with a chain, linking it to a sturdy ring bolted to the back of his neck, and he wore it with a clap. He sucked on spangles of many flavors. slipping out of a den of vise through a side door, slinking with surprising elegance along a knight alley thick with the leavings of debauchery. he whistled, oh, Danny Boy, attracting the attention of police officers threatened with truncheons and prosecution, he turned upon those who would do him harm or battle Liske stare and face them down magnificent in his imperiousness. His slobbering has increased as he grew older, and he collected them when he could into a tin spittle basin and left it out on his porch at night, where rainfall diluted the slobbering and the morning Jude diluted them further. And during his morning patrol, he pulled them into a pond. You could cut yourself on the creases in his trousers they were so well pressed. He armed them with a vintage paste week's be mine. Like George Clemens so he grew for breakfast. When taking refuge in thickets of shrubbery, he passed the time by fomenting wild schemes in his brain. The skin on his ears have a pattern of verdigris as if it were copper or bronze. Likewise the skin in the area of one of his collarbones

man of parts imagine him at 90 in a dingey somewhere out on the cold and roaring sea alone without or compass or radio set, or his beloved sausages in camphor, his 10 flask of Courvoisier almost empty, even here, long tailed vermin a scuttling through his mind like the sewer. It is his slobbering is unabated. Yet Two days later, he's to be found sprawled in a deck chair upon a golden beach. His still glorious Buffon shiny with hair oil, the bolt in the back of his neck freshly greased and dangling from the ring and the train of Panama hat, like the one favored by actor Sidney Greenstreet. And imagine him now. He just 10 at a crossroads in desolate terrain. A big black crow is perched on the signpost with a shall he wonder, this puny child

and I'm going to read something else to you now. That's come my way. I feel really keen traveller with only interesting gravy. You'd already be aware that there are two recommended forms of transport to suit your palate, the gravy boat and the gravy train. Some years ago, it was announced to the treatment safe gravy booster jetpack was being developed. But alas, funding for the project was fumbled. as is so often the case. And the company behind the scheme collapsed amid bitterness and gall like something from the book of Lamentations. There the story might have ended, but according to a fascinating documentary drew to be broadcast next week on the soup source and gravy focused online channel slops TV. One of the key figures involved is still working away at the idea from a potting shed on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond. hooting yard is always keen to salute inventors, be they cranks or visionaries. So I managed to obtain a transcript of part of the program. And that's what I'd like to read to you now. It's rather cramped in this potting shed on allotment in the dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond, and there's very little light, so you probably won't be able to see much apart from a press of gloom. Also, we're having a few problems with the camera. So the gloom will be not just oppressive, but juddery. I've just sent a runner back to the studio to save we can get a repair person or a replacement camera, but I'm not holding my breath. I was holding my breath a few minutes ago. However, because the man I've come here to see released some valves, and the potting shed was filled with fumes, which luckily have dispersed. Apparently, the fumes were so toxic, they could fill a field of cows in eight seconds flat from a huge distance. So I consider myself pretty lucky that I'm still talking to you. So who is he this man squashed into a cramped potting shed on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond releasing vows that let toxic fumes escape, endangering himself and me and prudence the camera woman Not to mention thousands of cows for miles around. Well, he won't tell me his name anyone speak. He wants to remain anonymous because of the top secret nature of what he's up to. And he won't speak because he says he's too busy resealing the valves and mucking about with all sorts of other gubbins. Now, you might think that faced with an uncooperative subject on a faulty camera, we would just pack up and go home. But here at slops TV, we don't know the meaning of failure. That's why we've become the top soup source and gravy focused online channel on the web. We press ahead with the big stories where the faint of heart and the weak minded would falter. As it says in our mission statement, were, quote, not just about soup and sauce and gravy, we're about the burning ambition and uncontrollable frenzy of a hothead, who simply doesn't understand the word no. Even prudence had to sign up to that one. And she's a Quaker, or a Mennonite or one of those quietest sects, and a damn fine camera woman if I may say so. See, now she's managed to find a sliver of light coming in for a gap in the roof of the potting shed on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond. And even though the camera is even more jugglery than before, you might just be able to get a glimpse of me presenting this exciting program, flailing my arms around in an intriguing way. You still want to see the man we've come to film because he's skulking about in the gloom, doing something to a pneumatic pump. I think he's holding a pair of tweezers in one fell in one hand. In fact, he's only got one hand, like a lot of crackpot inventors. He wears a prosthetic arm after losing the one he was born with in an explosion during one of his experiments. But that was then and this is now in the tension is building as he patiently goes about his tinkering in the darkness, like a mole or other burrowing animal. He's perfectly able to work in Stygian gloom, because he's been doing this for years, fashioning all sorts of contraptions designed to make the world a better place. I'll let you in on a little secret. It's not actually related to soup or sauce or gravy. So forgive me for going off message.

Frank Key  19:53
But this one armed man with his tweezers working diligently in a cramped potting shed on an old allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond, is the man who gave us the retractable bloater skewer that invaluable device, which allows us to retract the skewer on which we've skewered our bloaters. Who can imagine a breakfast of bloaters where such a simple tool is not at the very least an option? Oh, you can say, I don't want to retract the skewer for my bloaters Thank you very much. You can say that, and it might even be true, but I'll bet there are times when the thought niggles away at you that thanks to our friend here, you at least could if you wanted to.

Frank Key  20:42
prudence has very helpfully pointed out to me that soup sauce and gravy can all serve as a complement to bloaters. So I wasn't going wildly off message after all. That there's something strangely compelling about watching an amateur boffin at the top of his game. This reminds me of the time, excuse me. This reminds me of the time I was sent to do a report on a retired pig farmer, who had devised an entirely new kind of birds scarifier. It was made of bluffing paper, and reconstituted meat substitute and dust. And the idea was that you attached it to a bunch of balloons and launched it into the air over your pigsty, and it would stop your pigs being attacked by savage starlings and guillemots and chaffinches. That all pig farmer also had a prosthetic limb as a matter of fact, but in his case, it was a leg he to work from a potting shed. But rather than being on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond, his was at the edge of a dilapidated cluster of buildings that had once been his pig farm before he retired, set in a Sylvan Vale, with Brooks that babbled and dingli Dells. It was certainly the most idyllic dilapidated pig farm I have ever found report from the retired pig farmer gave me a demonstration of his invention. And I'm hoping soon that this chap in the gloom is going to do likewise, at the moment he's messing around with some flaps or nozzles, and I get the impression that he doesn't want to be interrupted. So while prudence his camera is still rolling, let's take a quick look outside. Well, as you can see, it's pretty grim. These are blizzard conditions. I can see some hollyhocks and attorney patch, but that's about it. It's actually quite difficult to get your bearings. In fact, I think we've strayed too far from the potting shed because I can't even see it anymore. We're in a sort of white nothingness. Ah, now, I don't know if you can see this on your screens. But prudence is pointing her camera at this sort of Wraith like being who is beckoning to us. It can't be my taciturn crackpot inventor friend, because it's much taller than him. Much, much taller. We're going to follow this impossibly huge out below goal. And this being slops TV, you can come with us. We're heading past some sleep last potato beds now. And there seem to be more raised a whole crowd of them, in fact, beckoning to us and groaning This is fantastic. That spooky part is that we never seem to be getting any closer to these gigantic Phantom beings. We must be a fair split from the potting shed by now judging by how far we've come, but the race still ahead of us, just at the edge of our vision, that groaning and teaming is getting louder, so more desperate, and there's something quite menacing about it. Oops, I think I just tried on a cabbage. And now I can't feel anything at all under my feet. It's as if we're in a complete void, white, limitless and desolate. prudence tells me that we're now surrounded by rays. They're behind us as well as ahead of us, at both sides, above us and below us. And the moaning and keening is growing ever more insistent and hideous and implacable? I haven't known anything like this since the report I did from the abyss of doom in the land of God. or hang on is that where we are now? time doesn't seem to mean anything anymore. No time. No space, just howling, beckoning ghouls in a cold white emptiness with prudence by my side, running out of film.

Apparently, if you if you go online to slops TV sometime next week you can see the program that that sort of transcript of the commentary from I don't know the URL though. The global merchandising arm of the hooting yard franchise, always keenly aware of what passes for the Zeitgeist, will shortly be launching upon a delighted public its latest product. Excuse me, you just have to put up with this as part of the live experience. years of ruinously expensive research have come to fruition with the appearance in a shop near you have the malevolent home monk culus action figure. deceptively innocent looking this tiny home monk culus sized home monk culus is actually a model of a particularly evil monkey this one which can be sent out on nocturnal escapades to terrorize one's unsuspecting neighbors. Although not as miniscule as the whole monkey was favored by spermicide theoreticians. It is still remarkably small about the size of a newborn squirrel. It has movable arms and legs, a fully rotating head and on well on shirt, the better to conceal it inherent malevolence. The package also includes a scenic backdrop made of sturdy cardboard of those pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing from brief encounter David lean 1945 against which the malevolent homerun killers can be posed spookily.

And that's the end of this week's hooting on the air I leave you with a new experiment I thought I might try to do digests of interesting new stories that I read in the papers. And the other the other week, day week I read. I read a piece and I thought this is interesting. So how can I cut it down to ease it's like almost like the hooting yard version of the Reader's Digest Think of it like that. I hadn't thought of it until now but that's what it is. So here's a new story. From I can't remember where I read it national newspaper corncrake brink of extinction, dove sized Coots and more hens, hay meadows, rural, devastated, insistent crack crack, skies, tractors, Scotland, crofting rasping double call, distinctive through the night, hand reared a climatized in pens, Nene washes, floodplain meadows, significant miracle corncrake project. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
