Good evening pickers, this is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM this piece is called gas it's hard to think of any so Tarik sect more hidden, more obscure than the IRQ gap. We know virtually nothing of its membership, its ceremonies and rituals. Its rayment investments, its perfumes, its symbols, its armaments cash, its hierarchy, its headgear, its idiosyncratic buttoning methods. Its potions its nostrums. Its pomposity. Its color schemes, its text, its insignia, its dietary stringencies its bucket and spade seaside outings or its ultimate purpose. Some have suggested that the gap does not even exist. One wonders then what to make of evaporated milk and duct blood. The latest best selling paperback by pebble head with its audacious subtitle, the truth about Urk gap revealed as ever with his ventures into non fiction, pebble heads prozess, breathless and slapdash and at times laughable, but he makes grand claims and they deserve to be treated seriously. After all, we're unlikely to get a better guide to this mysterious sect, even if it is wholly spurious. One thing pebble head refuses to tell us is from what sources he cobbled his 300 plus pages together. Indeed, one reviewer has already insisted that the book ought to be shelved alongside fantasy fiction, that pebble head has made the whole thing up. But how would anyone know one way or the other unless they were a member of the IRQ gap? It may be pertinent that the review in question disguised his identity behind a terrifically wrought anagram. But let us look at some of pebble heads claims. Membership, the IRQ gap has a finite number of members, when one dies of which more in a moment, they are replaced by a new recruit. How this newcomer is chosen is an ineffable mystery, it is possible that there are as few as 12 members at any one time, although other estimates give a figure of several thousand IRQ gaps gang members do not die in the sense that you are I would understand the term instead they are quote big gusted into Flim Flam. Unquote. pebble head does not expand upon this. ceremonies and rituals. The major IRQ gap ceremony is the so called knocking about of the ball with the puck, which as far as one can gather may look to the innocent I like hockey practice. Thus, intones pebble head ominously does the SEC conceal its existence by creating a facsimile of a well loved sport, which is part of the fabric of our everyday lives. If we are sporty persons, of course. There is another ritual involving binoculars, promontories and seabirds, which can be equally misconstrued by the ignorant Raymond and vestments unutterably gorgeous according to pebble head, and so stylish that gap members can be mistaken for dazzling stars of the Riviera set. Apparently, there is something called the cufflink code. But the details of that, too, are an ineffable mystery. perfumes, the earth gas can be sniffed out with toll if one is sensitive to certain vaporous effusions. pebble head gets rather tied up in knots trying to explain what on earth he's babbling on about here, and the passage is dense with footnotes. At one point he suggests the sense with which the IRQ gap sprays themselves are odorless, which, if true, is either foolish in the extreme or perhaps yet Another of those ineffable mysteries

symbols, chiefly pelicans, silkworms, bowls of alphabet soup, chunks of gak herons, old Bakelite wireless set, dust, corks, bat, cravat pins, big fat magnetic robots, calf injuries, oil, drums, pulp, song Thrashers, camphor, sausages, toadflax, Gibbs, cloudburst, mayonnaise, tin tabernacles, blocks, mist and Herculean effort. All these things with their deep IRQ gap significance are depicted on a gigantic shield, carted about the countryside dead of night by blind devotees. All or so pebble head would have us believe. armaments cash, the earth Gar, are fond of howitzers, and have been known to fire them when unprovoked. If you hear a mysterious explosion in the distance on a Thursday at dusk, that might be the IRQ gap. hierarchy. There are so many levels right pebble head, so many, many, many levels. Gosh, my head is spinning. Normal novelty pebble had dolls with spinnable heads went on sale in Toy shops as part of the publicity for the book, presumably to go give some credence to this assertion. headgear less Riviera set more grimy peasant shapeless, filthy rags puckered up and scrunched and plopped atop the pate, beetles and other black creeping things scurry among the fold. They can hardly be called hats, but are made by milliners contracted individually by some kind of irk gaff hat msre whereabouts this position fits within the hierarchy his mood, pebble heads head was presumably spinning far too rapidly, them to be able to enlighten us and was the paper backlist himself wearing a sordid Earth gap hat as he wrote. There are, after all, plenty of corrupt millionaires setting up shopping our streets, More's the pity. idiosyncratic buttoning methods. All this buttoning and unbuttoning wrote the anonymous 18th century suicide was he or she a member of the Urk Gar, practicing auto biggest went into Flim Flam. pebble head does not tell us probably because he doesn't know. But he does devote an excruciating 40 pages of his book to the matter of buttons, and buttoning and unbuttoning and unbuttoned excruciating because here his prose is at its sloppiest. And it's impossible to make head nor tail of what he's trying to say. I for one, would have been interested in the earth gap concept of the unbutton. For example, quote, that which is not and cannot be a button on any possible planet, unquote. potions, the most popular of gap potions appears to be a decoction of evaporated milk and Duck's blood. Hence the title of pebble heads tome. This mixture is drunk from lovely goblets or from Piper cups, depending upon the alignment of the stars, and the idiosyncratic buttoning method in use at the time. Where the devotees get all the ducks blood from is an inevitable mystery, as they say not to approve of the slaughter of ducks, or of anything else which paddles in ponds. There is another potion of evaporated milk without the commingling of ducks blood, of which the Urk gap are equally fond. nostrums pebble head alludes to a bulky collection of nostrums, which the IRQ gap are set to apply to common ag use. Many of these remedies are of a purgative effect, which I'm afraid conjures up the image of a troop of secretaries throwing up all over the place, and an overpowering stink of regurgitated evaporated milk and ducks blood. I looked up mops and disinfectant in the index of the book, but neither word appears there. In fact, the index It's a very shoddy piece of work and I think it may have been taken from another book entirely.

pebble head has done this before Of course, through either indolence or stupidity. pomposity. There is an inherent pomposity in most occult and esoteric sects, acting as a sort of protective veneer. Without pump, the edifice might crumble and crumble mint must be avoided at all costs. color schemes, mostly sepia texts, one of pebble heads most startling discoveries is that the list of the foundational texts of the earth gap is identical in every particular to a list of volumes stolen over a period of five years from the list our library. We know that the list was so enraged by the theft that they sent a gang of merciless cutthroats in search of the culprits. But the fact that the books were never returned to the library suggests that the IRQ gap, if indeed, the thieves were among their number, must have outwitted the tundish Avengers. This ought not be surprising. Recent studies have shown that contrary to myth, the tundras were a witless a noodle brained bunch, many of whom did not even know what an owl was, despite the comprehensive collection of hourly pros in their library. But if the basic text of the Urk gap are indeed originally tongue dissed, I'll tell you a mere sub sect That is a question to which one hopes a writer more scholarly and less populist than pebble head will address themselves. Though the survival rate of authors investigating Tumblr ism is calamitously low, and much blood has been spilled. Not all of it the blood of ducks insignia pebble head makes a cat candid attempt to sketch the insignia of the IRQ gap on the frontispiece of his book, it looks as if he used crayons, a six year old would have made a better Fist of it. Dietary stringencies what foodstuffs we might ask does the gap wash down with their evaporated milk conducts blood potions? The answer, according to pebble head is anything from the tuber family and anything with a hip or wort suffix. That seems pretty stringent to me. But then Ollie anything as well pebble head himself. I had dinner with him a few weeks ago, and we scuffed a surfeit of lampreys and more bloaters than his dining table could support he had to have it shored up with cast iron props. bucket and spade seaside outings. an endearing feature of the Urk gap is their predilection for bucket and spade seaside outings, less enduring, much less enduring, is that their favorite destination is the foul and filthy fishing port of Oh hooligans Wharf. It is a curious place to rattle towards on the train, waving one's bucket and spade cheerilee out the window for of course, there is no sandy beach there merely a couple of rotting jetties built upon squelchy oozing mud. Mud is home to disgusting squirmy wriggling things, which are surely abominations in the sight of God. And yet, year after year, the earth gap descend upon this briny hellhole mad with glee. What they actually do with their buckets and spades when they get there does not bear thinking about the most pebble head will divulge is that shutters go up in the welkin crusted hovels, the streets empty and a fog of eerie mist falls upon the port. ultimate purpose. This of course, as pebble head readily admit, is the final ineffable mystery of the IRQ gap. It brings his book to a limp and unsatisfactory ending, which he tries to bolster by dazzling the reader with vividness. But purple head doesn't really do vivid, at least not in his nonfiction, and the resulting closing paragraphs are pitiable. The reader senses that he knows this, which is why in a last desperate lunge at thrill some this pebble head Chuck's in an extremely potted pen portrayed of his favorite pig.

Every now and then I get letters from readers and listeners signing saying, Frank, what picture do you have on your computer as your kind of desktop wallpaper? Well, it changes of course, but I thought I'd let you know that currently. It's a photograph from the, the blog, unmitigated England have a 10 cow sign at sloughed whole farm. Fantastic picture cow with an evil eye. And you can see it the hooting yard website you know where that is. hooting, hooting yd.org Yes, attend cow sign from sludge Hill Farm, I think possibly inspired this piece, which I wrote this morning, I'm not sure why it would have done anyway this is a brand new piece written this morning that I where it came from. It's called impugned by a peasant. I was in Pune by a peasant. It was a Thursday afternoon, and I was walking along a line between Aspen's and larches I saw the peasant up ahead. He was leaning against the style, and as I got closer, I saw he was idly swinging a flail to no great purpose. As I passed him, he impugned me in some sort of rustic invective I barely understood, I would have dashed him to the ground with a single blow. But alas, I am a milk syrup and a weakling and I merely passed on by along the lane, blushing and furious. Later, as I sat on a countryside canteen, drinking a tumbler of sculpture, I reflected upon this peasant and his impugning. What was he doing? leaning against that style? Why was he swinging a flail? In what brutish are God did he speak? Much to my disgust, I realized I was obsessed by him. As in debt in Venice, Gustav von aschenbach is obsessed by tadeo or in love and death on Long Island. Giles, the ass is obsessed by Ronnie Bostock. But tadeo and Ronnie a young and beautiful, whereas my peasant, my peasant was old and snaggletooth and filthy and wretched. My hands were shaking, and I swapped some of my sculpture on the canteen table, drowning a fly. As I returned along the lane, I adjusted the cravat around my neck to give it a more rakish look. And I print my Buffon and I turned my trudge to a sort of flouncing prompts. As I neared the bend in the lane beyond which the style would come into view. My heart began to thump violently, and my mouth became so dry. I gasped. Would my peasant still be there? Would he impugn me again? I wanted to run back to the safety of the canteen, but at the same time, I was desperate to see him again. So filthy, so ancient, so vile. How can I express the sickening sensation I felt as I rounded the bend and saw that my peasant was gone? It was as if a not a valid Vipers rise within my guts, sunlight data Hold through the Aspen's and the large is a breeze refresh the air, and there was the style. But leaning on it now we're to impossibly attractive youngsters playing conquers closing in on them panting like a monster of depravity. I saw a war name badges. One was tadeo the other Ronnie I was barely coherent as I babble that them asking if they had seen a peasant, an old, filthy snaggletooth peasant with a flail. Had they seen in which direction he had gone, and when and was he going fast or slow with purpose or without? And did the son glisten on his greasy matted hair? First tadeo then Ronnie impugned me in particular they impugned my cravat and my Buffon and my flouncing, I crumpled to the ground weeping and numerous scenic, I would have welcomed death there and then,

but of course, I did not die. an hour or two later, I got to my feet and dusted the muck of the lane from my Italianate suit. The sun was sinking in the West, and tadeo and Ronnie were long gone. I picked up a pebble and chucked it in expertly at a limit perched in an Aspen. I missed the bird of course, and I've branched away from the style and made my way home. Years later, looking back on that afternoon, I can no longer picture the name tagged used, but the vision of the peasant is it clear to me as if he was sat here opposite me. I do not have him of course, but I have his simulacrum, posed in the armchair built of cardboard and wire and wall with piano keys for his teeth, and a light dusting of authentic countryside muck. And when I activate the console, he impugns me in that mechanical guttural, rustic invective. I have a character actor record for me, and which still still, I barely understand.

No doubt this is the wrong time of year for winter sports advice, but we might as well get in early and if you remember this, you will be alright in a few months time. Passes arch or Potter's crank. It's a choice you have to make when tobogganing in a split second, pick the wrong maneuver, and bones might be broken, or the very least sprained and you'd almost certainly end up with a mouthful of snow. If your movements were impaired, as well, they might be by dint of bone damage, and a fresh fall of snow occurred from those expansive bleak gray skies with little wind, you could be buried, or Christ have you erased. For in the morning, a passing hiker or cadet would see a smooth untrodden white blanket stretching from here all the way across to where the woods begin at the foot of the mighty mountain. Your toboggan would be buried alongside you some yards away, at the point where you were tossed from it into the snow, like an Eskimo rag doll. make the right choice in that instant between arch and crank, and no such calamity will befall you. You will continue zooming downward, whatever the gradient with bumps and buffets to be sure but joyously until as the slope evens out at the end of the course, you will slow gradually and come to a halt at the scoring station. It is just a little hut, the station where officials in woolly hats await you and mark your time and elegance in their records. They are passionless men these officials. If you choose wrongly between potters arch and Potter's crank, and a helpless in the snow with broken bones, somewhere up on the slope. They send no search parties. They wait and wait. sipping schnapps from their flasks, pointing to pines, scanning the sky until The sun begins to set and then and they went their way along the hop scag to the village to homely hearth and warm bed. They will not even think of you alone on the mountain slopes as snow falls from the sparkling night sky, burying you and your bashed up dented toboggan you should not believe what you've heard about big dogs coming to snuffle you out with brandy barrels fastened about their necks. There are no such hounds in the hops gag. It is said they are frightened away by the mountain spirits, the groaning race they prey upon the souls of crashed tobogganist. That is why in that split second you have to choose your maneuver to make that decisive potters arch or Potter's crank. You should trust to neither skill nor instinct, but to the mountain spirits. offer yourself to them brain and bone and body and soul frame and core in a howl of subjugation to their power and make your move. They will tell you whether to arc or to crank. But be warned, they are mischievous and fickle. The dogs learned that long ago. tobogganist have not yet.

And I'd like to end this week with this is a quote from a great website called awful library books written by two librarians. Anyway, one of the Mary wrote true confession, I have had to library clown Crammers in my career. Mary clearly didn't work at the pointy town municipal library during the 1950s. Or she would have had many more such traumas between 1952 and 1958. The library was staffed entirely by frightful clowns in full traditional clown costume as part of a social engineering experiment conducted by the blots midnight head librarian, one Bob crotch. She never made clear the purpose of her scheme nor indeed its results. She died in the Munich air disaster, puzzlingly for no one ever discovered what connection she had with the Busby Babes. And her replacement, his head librarian quietly dropped the whole clown business one Tuesday morning in March 1958. She tricked all the staff into thinking they were going on a sharer bank outing, and once they were all aboard, she persuaded the driver to take them to a big top erected on a piece of land reserved for government nerve gas tests. And so ended the reign of clowns at pointy town municipal library. Further reading library clown tremors, what they are and how to shake them out of your head good and proper, using bleach and a dog whistle by Dobson out of print. I'll be back next week. Bye bye
