Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. This is hosting out on the air, aka a general air of decrepitude, decrepitude, and half blindness. My name is Frankie this week show juta is live of course as ever, and due to the unbearable heat, we've got the windows open. So you may, you may pick up in the background the ambient sounds of South London tinies shrieking and the occasional passing lorry. Yes, so that just gives you some context. I'm going to read to you as I'm, if you just tuned in, you won't know but if you were listening to Paul plug, you will know that this today's shows an all ethology special and unusual unusually for hooting out I'm going to be telling you about certain birds. And the first piece is called the Robin. The Robin is a type of bird. It may be found in near spaces perched on a bow. Arrival upon departure from the bow is accomplished by flight flight achieved by deployment of the wings, a pair. Not all birds are capable of flight, but the Robin is. During parchment, the Robin may be captured by placing over it a net attached to one end of a stick. While it is thus prevented from flying away, one can insert a syringe through the net and stand the Robin with a sedative, rendering unconscious. Then the net can be lifted up and the bird placed in the pocket. One should ensure that the bow from which the Robin is abducted is within a short walking distance of the laboratory or other workplace. If the bird regains consciousness while in the pocket, it will panic and flap about my well exercise its wings sufficiently to fly free up and away into the boundless sky. Upon arrival at the lab, place the stunned bird on a work surface and injected with another dose of the serum calibrated to keep it away with the fairies for a few hours. various activities can now be carried out with the unconscious Robin. These may be in the spirit of scientific inquiry or just larking about technically the lark is a different type of bird and has nothing to do with remarking about at least not in the present context. A fun intense shortly before the Robin wakes up. It's tiny brain woozy to reply. Sorry, if one intends shortly before the Robin wakes up it's tiny brain woozy to replace it on its bow on a different but nearby bow. It is important that no great harm should come to the bird as a result of the activities whatever they may be. Small modifications to the unconscious Robin are permissible. For example, plucking out a handful of feathers for later examination under a microscope at one's leisure or painting it an entirely different color with a non toxic pigment. But another account should one remove say its head for in doing so. One will kill the Robin and it will not wake from its induced coma if carrying out scientific experiment It's wells bear in mind that the Robin is but one type of bird and one cannot extrapolate from the results of one's experiment deductions applicable to all types of birds, not even to all Robin's. It may not be a normal Robin. If simply larking about say by dipping the feet in a pool of ink and then printing a false bird trail across the bedroom, the ceiling of a white one is plotting to drive insane as in the Patrick Hamilton play Gaslight, one need not bother whether the Robin is normal or not. The villainous husband in Gaslight did not print such a bird trail, but it's the sort of tactic he might have used had he had access to an unconscious Robin.

When replacing the bird on its bow, it will need to be propped up right until it's fully awake. Otherwise it will topple to the ground. Due to gravitational force. Use a small structure of interlaced twigs or some such temporary bolster. upon waking the Robin will probably be star itself and use it to wings to depart the bow in flight up into the sky until it is quite out of sight. Its destination unknown even to the Robin itself.

Listen, these are extract from Mr. Keys book of birds a work in progress. And this is chapter two, the willow warbler. The Willow warbler is a type of bird. As its name suggests, it hangs around in the vicinity of willow trees and it warbles. In the notebook you keep in a waterproof PICHETTE on a lanyard around your neck, there is probably a page headed birds beginning with w i have seen on wick who have written a list of birds beginning with W. When you see one of these birds, you either make a tick next to the name or cross it out and decisively with your propelling pencil. In order to retrieve this result for the willow warbler then you need to be near willow trees or possibly just one willow tree and you also need to listen out for warbling. If there are no willow trees in sight and you cannot hear anything resembling a warm, you're very unlikely to spot a willow warbler. The first thing to do then, is to get yourself close to some willows. Do not forget to take your binoculars with you unless you're blessed with uncommonly piercing vision. Unlike me, in which case, you probably have not bothered to buy or rent a pair of binoculars. It may be that you live far oh so far from any willow trees, and congenital infirmity forbids you from lengthy travel. In such circumstances, you need not give up all hope of spotting a willow warbler thing to do is to obtain and plant in the ground in your garden, some Willow saplings if you do not have a garden, choose a patch of Commons as close to your domain as possible and plant the saplings there. You will of course have to wait some years for the saplings to grow into the kind of lush verdant willow trees likely to attract a willow warbler. But why do you wait, you can spend profitable time reading up on the bird so you can be all the more certain you know one when you see one. And of course, reading books about birds can be done in the comfort of your armchair if you have one, and you need not strain your feeble and debilitated limbs. If you do not have an armchair, you can simply sprawl on the floor. Several other types of birds are known to hang around in the vicinity of willows. This is where your ability to recognize the warbling of a willow warbler becomes critical. Bear in mind, however, that not only do several other types of birds work in the Willows, but several other types of birds also warble I'm not going to give you a complete or even a partial list of such birds. So don't Ask. What you need to do is to learn the distinctive warbling sound made by the willow warbler, which differentiates it from other warbling birds. There might be some cassette tape recordings in your local lending library, or you can interrogate an ornithologist. After much diligence study, you should be able to recognize the willow warbler with both your eyes and your ears. What you then have to do is drag yourself towards the patch of willows pair intently and prick up your ears and wait for a bird to appear that matches both the sight and sound of the willow warbler. In so far as you have rammed those concepts into your head. You can then take the take your notebook out of its Pichet, flip to the request required page and either tick or cross out the name of the bird. As we've seen, depending on your physical robustness, or lack thereof, this may take many years to accomplish. But boy oh boy, it's well worth it with icing on top.

The corncrake The corncrake is a type of bird. It's cool. It's raucous and alarming. To gain an idea of how raucous and how alarming Imagine you're fast asleep in bed. Because you're obsessed with the rigors of polar exploration. You sleep like Roald Amundsen with your bedroom window wide open in all seasons of the year through this open window, flies a corncrake and it comes into land upon your head. Ordinarily, the sensation of its talons digging into your Buffon to steady its perking would awaken you. But you are wearing your thickly woven wooly swaddling sleep helmet as recommended by Vaughn strowman z. having suffered from debilitating insomnia for many years, you studied once three albums these exciting new discipline of snooze ethics. Now, before retiring, you drink a pint of lukewarm milk of magnesia Pick yourself tossing the content of your brain into a wooden crate and hammering that hammering shut the lid of the crate with 10,000 nails the same number of nails Cornelius Cardew thought sufficient to seal the coffin of imperialism and you don the sleep helmet before hopping, never climbing but hopping into bed. You have found that ever since following vaunts three albums these procedures religiously, your sleep is deep and untroubled.

Frank Key  13:36
And not unlike a coma. virus when the corncrake a light upon your head and digs its talons into the thick wall of your sleep helmet to steady itself in its purging. You do not feel a thing. You remain fast asleep content and snug in lala land. From its perch, the corncrake surveys its surroundings. If you asked it, why it had flown in through the window. And if it was somehow capable of responding in an approximation of human speech so that you've understood it to apply. It is likely that the corncrake would have absolutely no idea what in pelvic who knows why birds do what they do? Not even the birds themselves know, for their brains are tiny. Rather than using reason. Birds follow the dictates of instinct. What you or I would call gut feelings, or were able to say is that on this occasion, the corncrake saw the open window and took the opportunity to fly into your bedroom, probably in the hope of finding something to eat. Fortunately, densely woven wool does not feature as part of a corncrakes regular diet.

Frank Key  15:03
So, while the bird rests from the exertions of its flight, perched on your head, it trained it to black fathomless savage in human eyes upon your bedroom. It takes in the freeze of martyred saints along the dado rail, the wainscot, the wardrobe, the chest of drawers, the rug and the unseemly stains. It takes in the clutter atop the bedside cabinet, the glass of water, the folded spectacles, the scrunched tissue, the anglepoise lamp. Sorry, I'm going to start that list again. The glass of water, the folded spectacles, the scrunched up tissue, the anglepoise lamp, the stray button, the by row, the pins, the bowl, the dust, the cardboard, carton of pills, the alarm clock, the other button, the little jars, the liquor bottles, the nameless thing me, the biscuit crumbs, the Smashbox the coinage, the pipe cleaners, the mud idol, the cotton wall, with toffee, Apple wrapper, the handkerchief, the string, the puppet, the patty, the Duster, the rag, the bus ticket, the scrap of paper, the pocket Bible, the rosary beads, the taffy 10, the bomb bomb, the monkey snapshot in a frame, the atomizer the shopping list, the rubber band, the drawing pin, the poster Madonna, the plastic Madonna and cloud statuette for a sophisticated cocktail party invitation, the chewing gum, the gloves, the telephone, were at a magpie or a backdoor rather than a corncrake. It might swoop and snatch up in its beak one of the smaller items on top of the cabinet and fly out through the window and a way to deposit the stolen Google in its nest. In folktales, and legends, magpies and jackdaws often appear as thieves the bird equivalent of opportunistic pickpocket, and this characterization has some basis in brute avian fact. Not so the corncrake which is not thought of as a pillar during bird. So while it gazes upon the clutter, it remains still perched upon your sleeping head and swoops not to snatch booty in its beak. Still an act it will be hard to imagine a night more still more silent than this one. The Vance throbbing z method ensures you make no stentorian snoring noise, the sound of your breathing is almost imperceptible muffled by the sleep helmet. The corncrakes breathing is equally quiet. Nothing stirs in your bedroom. And from outside through the open window, there is not even a breath of wind. It is this it is as if the planet has fallen asleep with you. I have said that we can have no idea what prompts a bird to do what it does. So I can offer no logical reason explanation for the sudden, loud, jarring, raucous cry of the corncrake on your head. It makes it hard core twice, then lifts off and flies away out of the window. The effect on you is instantaneous and awful. You waken alarmed, indeed, panic stricken as if prodded with a burning hot pointy stick. You do not see the corncrake fly away so you cannot account for the hora by which you are convulsed trembling you clamber out of bed and shuffle through your toilet to pedal, a pedal occasioned by fear, such as the raucous and alarming call of the corncrake.

The CIF trap the trip trap is a type of bird. It could be said to be a difficult little bird, for reason to which explain. The trip trap is almost exactly the same type of bird as the willow warbler and the difficulty arises Because I've already told you about the willow warbler. I'm not trying to claim that these two birds are identical in all particulars, as that would be foolish, but quite honestly, they're sour like the only the most acutely observant among you would be able to tell a difference. It would not surprise me to learn that even a trip craft might mistake a willow warbler for a trip trap, and vice versa. So what hope can there be for us humans? Some might argue that birds organs of perceptions act in some might argue that bird organs of perception act in ways wholly alien to us and their apprehension of the world around them is as a consequence, so vastly different to how's good trip travel always recognize the chief Katniss of another trip Jeff, and the willow warblers of a willow warbler. It will be fruitless to argue the case. All I'm trying to say is that as far as we humans are concerned, there is precious little difference between the two birds. So having devoted a chapter to the willow warbler, I do not want to keep risk repeating myself by chuntering on about the cliff calf. Christ knows the repetitions involved in writing about birds and numerous enough beaked feathers wings talents, you're already more than familiar with them, and we have not yet started to consider.

Frank Key  21:39
We've not yet started to consider such things as slashed and savage semi digested field mice and voles and other gruesome dishes from the birdie recipe book. Yet well some repetitiveness is unavoidable in a work such as this, if the reader or listener is to gain a clear understanding of all the different birds, I don't want to type out or recite the same baloney over and over again. Things will be much easier if similar or in some cases, identical types of birds had not been given several different names. Don't get me started on the green plover, for example. But we must deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be in our wildest dreams. This Earthbound realism is particularly and paradoxically necessary in the case of birds, which in the mind, tend not to be Earth bound at all. One of the first things the amateur will notice about birds is that God has granted them the power of flight. There are of course exceptions, such as the ostrich, a huge and very stupid bird, which is tethered by gravity to the earth as decisively as you and me. But the cliff track like the majority of birds can fly. Anything else that might usefully be said about the CIF calf has already been covered in the chapter on the willow warbler, you can trust me on this. It goes without saying that I know more about birds than you do. After all, I'm the writer and you whoever you are of the reader or the listener, and it seems plain as the peas on my fork that if you already knew much about bird, you wouldn't feel the need to read the book or listen to the show. You'd be out tramping the countryside, a pair of binoculars dangling around your neck, pointing at the feathered friends and showing off by exclaiming to your companion. Oh look Constance, a chief chaff suspecting that poor Constance thought she was peering at a willow warbler.

The cow the cow is a type of bird. It is also known as the misprint bird, because by writes there should be an R between the C and the O to make Crow and include biteable bird. What happened is that certain slapdash, ornithological writers who skimp on proofreading have given tau where they mean crow. The error is more common in Britain than in verbal ornithology in the latter. The varying pronunciations of the left I tend to alert even the most misty brain bird expert to the difference. In cow we always pronounced as an owl, the exclamation you make out the exclamation you make when, for example, a crow a light on your head and pecks at your scalp with it sharp, fearsome beak in order to gobble up various little beetles and creepy crawlies and breadcrumbs scattered in your boufal because you have not bothered to wash your hair for several weeks. In crow on the other hand, the O is pronounced as in the surname of Sebastian Coe, the high speed Olympic champion, better known for his wrestling bout with William Hague MP in the gymnasium of the Houses of Parliament. Interestingly, if we substitute the rest the wrestler the wrestlers initial see for a K last coat, we arrived at the Flemish word for a cow. In that case, however, it is well to bear in mind that the O in the Flemish code is qu is pronounced ly the enqueue which is the sound made by doves and pigeons and various other birds. You can see how this all hangs together. Only a network would think a cow was actually a bird, as opposed to being a misprint, bird. cows have neither beaks nor feathers nor wings nor talents, nor are they capable of flight. It is true that there is a nursery rhyme in which a cow jumps over the moon, and that high, high leaping can in some circumstances be mistaken for flying. It is possible. The rhyme was originally transcribed by a slapdash ornithologist who skimped on proofreading. And what was meant was, the crow flew over the moon. Visually, you might see a crow flying over the moon, depending on your angle of view, from your position in a muddy field on Earth, in relation to both the cow burps, I mean, the Crow and the moon. Though it is not often one sees a crow flying around the sky at night, a time when most crows are fast asleep in their nest. Cows, on the other hand, do not make nests basically been buyers.

And that's the end of this week Show. I'm sure you've learned much about birds. And sorry about the little pauses. I'm reading from a book you can read those pieces in a book called The funny mountain which you can buy a copy of via the hooting on website. And so I have to kind of turn the page I could do with one of those things that concert pianist and musicians have someone to turn the pages for me why he's going I'm gonna need someone to read things for me because I was reading that through a pair of high powered goggles and a mic and a magnifying glass and are still going on you just see it. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I'll be back next week. Thank you to john. Bye bye.
