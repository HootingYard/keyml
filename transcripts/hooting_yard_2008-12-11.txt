Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. We begin this week with a trip down memory lane. About 20 years ago, there was a great deal of excitement about crop circles. And I don't know if you remember that, but crop circles were appearing everywhere. Anyway, some people thought they were hoaxes. But in the end, we discovered that they were, in fact deeply important, cosmic phenomena, the importance of which I've actually forgotten at the time, I was really very proud to publish a pamphlet by the eminent professors Zoltan Kieron lop in a small addition of 50 numbered copies of a popular science paper called crop circles, the mystery solved, which was published as long ago as 1990 seems like another world. Anyway, I thought I'd read it to you. This is Alton krung, Locke's essay on crop circles. The crop circle phenomenon has become the subject of grave concern in the scientific community, as well as attracting the attention of a motley band of pseudo scientists. You know who these people are UFO spotters, lay hunters, believers in the paranormal, whatever that is, new agers and the throng of misfits and muddlers regularly trotting out their inept half baked theories. Most of these ungainly people were anoraks for some reason, but that's the subject of a separate study. The time has come to apply stern scientific reasoning to the phenomenon and who better to undertake the task than myself. You will of course be familiar with my track record. I first came to public attention at the 1954 inns mouth conference, Who can forget the gasps of admiration which greeted my paper on bats glue and shriveling. Subsequently revised and expanded. My coruscating argument was published in paperback in 1957, and went on to sell by the million. Further bestsellers followed on a bewildering array of subject. Is there anyone alive who does not own a copy of my propulsion mechanisms fueled by burned fish, or misery with gravel? I think not. Unlike most of the people who spout it forth on the crop circle phenomenon, Siri ologists, they dubbed themselves to my vast amusement, I have taken the trouble to carry out enormously complicated experiments. Realizing the need to create laboratory conditions. I bought a large field in Wilshere, which had been the site of well documented crop circles during the previous two years. I then cordoned off the site by building an invisible force field around it. This was rather time consuming and my bank manager became worried. Last however, I was able to put my unbelievably fascinating machine into position. Attaching clamps to the slat with quarter inch Gulliver bolts, I smeared the latticework with the decoction of binding agents and threaded the netting through the 10 clips, allowing me to dislodge the hasp on the paddle in order to broad enough purchase on the metal flanges, which were arranged in rotation. Beside the color coded pails, the white one being strapped to a clogged bracket, the red ones spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held in place by rubber frets and the black one trimming against the LM minium knob on the wicked, which had been fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled by a clay handle on the bowl against which pellets were fired pre arranged intervals by the steam gun just below the fourth set of nozzles cleverly positioned at such a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases to pass over the top Pauling

in which punctures had been made to allow ease of passage for the an iron tubes carrying ball bearings to the spandrel and thus onto the rotating wooden platform upon which the greased hinges chafed against the pulleys sufficiently for the sparks to ignite sulfur bombs inside the Bakelite carriage without in danger. During the pads, bulbs and trucks on the hooter, at the sounding of which the intricately wired snares would snap shot and entrapped, the soiled plasticine clumps, thus momentarily halting the recurrent biting movements of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of Todd into the motor around which I placed Canvas bags packed with candles. In order to steady the persistent rattling of the ticker. On the back of the iron sledge underneath the trolley carrying the double battery powered hammer, which served to agitate the drum, containing the four inch blade detach from the rusted bow of the compass held in place on the rocket by a monstrous two titanium screw wedged against the plackets of the grid distributor I had earlier customized by locking it gut probes into position with no less than 26 separate multiple gate plugs on each of which a scorch zinc disc swiveled in response to the magnetic properties of the special basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out of the glass globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by trains which run parallel to the length of string tied at one end to the pirates, Orioles, and the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags I had stolen from the same warehouse, which provided the hooks for the plank balanced and easily across the gap between the pinboard and the hot domitor. Fitted with small beeswax parceled lashed to the crane. From which dangled several springs and coils loaded with lead weights and enamel cubes the purpose of which became apparent when the gleaming cork was plunged into the canister of boiling duck pond water kept at constant temperature by hastily repaired piping, fed by siphons and buttress by giant prongs from the surfaces of which had been expunged precisely engraved instructions for the use of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the Derrick next to the pumps on the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange taffeta swaddling material as a stop to the gate who provided the jars, flakes and asbestos free winged cranks are required for timing the bleaching operation on the plastic squirting mechanism molded out of discarding beetle caps salvaged from a manufacturer of resins whose grotesque sponge hood had been incorporated into the workings of the shiny magnesium tripod, a top which looked a uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic pan containing phosphorus hoops, and a glamorous leather trumpet pitch towards a cobalt beaker lit up by the McKenzie beam angled obliquely next to a yellow frosty and canopy covering a massive trellis to which were glued and appended cone veiled by cotton wall wrapped around a toy horse with a propeller caked in Mercury, powering the fulcrum and bailed on the fractured tub counter sunk behind the crust of a feather on a storm with pins affixed to the Legion grill place to skew atop the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Incredible as it may seem, I had stitched the flap to the basket with insufficiently strong cord, and it now became dangerously loose. after securing it properly, I was forced to check the entire mechanism over again. While I was so engaged, it began to rain, throwing an enormous piece of waterproof sheeting over my brilliant contraption. I made my way to the cow and pins and proceeded to get drunk.

The snug was full of people I took to be the local peasantry, a curdled and prurient lot for the most part, I handed out copies of some of my less taxing pamphlets, and press the coin or two into the grubby palms. I then entertained the company by performing a number of pieces on the theramin until the downpour ceased. reeling back across the field to my experimental crop circles station, I stumbled against a barbed wire fence and lacerated my left leg. an alarming amount of blood spurted forth from the wound and splashed up on the Bracken. Unless a scientist would have scuttled off to the nearest doctor wailing and winching, you will be pleased to hear that I am not such a sissy. Oh, no, I'm never without a supply of bandages. I dressed my wound in a thoroughly professional fashion and strode onward a towering figure in the history of scientific inquiry. My boots spattered with mud. As I closed upon the majestic engine which I had built with my bare hands, the machine which would solve the mystery of crop circles. Trimble, ie Siri ologists Kieron lop has come among you stars experience Loading in his head, belching forth light and truth. I have knocked itself unconscious against the invisible force field as swallowing hard, I pressed the machine started button. Immediately the air was filled with buzzing and hissing. Hornets and bees swarmed around me. Small things with horns and beaks squirmed around my feet, the sky darkened, thunderclaps rang in my ears. A horrendous wind shrieked out of nowhere and knocked me to the ground. The machine began to emit harsh metallic growls and grinding noises. I shoved bits of bandage into my ears, gritted my teeth and tried desperately to stand upright in the howling Tempest. to my horror, I saw eels, eels slithering towards me, then bat then flies. mercifully, I remember nothing more. When I came to, I found myself lying on my back in a hard bed in a white shattered room. This I remember saying to myself, is not the snog of the cow and pins. Indeed, it was not. I was in a hospital, and I was dangerously ill, or so I was later informed by some insolent pantry boy who thought himself a doctor. I insisted on discharging myself at once, I need to be jabbed with a syringe and sent asleep again. This little scene was repeated daily for what seemed like weeks, I would clamber out of bed demanding my trousers and my sturdy walking boots, and it would be bundled back in and poked out with needles. It must have been November when, in a moment of lucidity, I made my escape, only to be apprehended while wandering the stinking grounds, seeking a way out. So I have given me my own hat. Now with a writing desk and a kettle. I stamp mercilessly upon beetles with my carpet slippers. The air still stinks, but I'm growing used to it. they've promised me a mug for my cocoa and their little set of mustard hangings. Such kindness should not go unrewarded. And I hope soon to present the staff with a pencil case or a leech trap or some such Google. As for crop circles, have whatever you wish to know is surely mundane, mundane and tiresome. Play Skittles hop drink, but ask me not about crop circles. The lids will snap shut over my eyes, and I will fall asleep.

Here's a piece I've read before. It doesn't have a sentence in it as long as Zoltan Kieron lops sentence about his crop circle detection machine. And I've heard it before but I kind of like it so I thought I'd read it to you again. It's about the savage infant of splat. Marry gold true the savage infant of splat. splat is a tiny stricken village in Cornwall. That's true, by the way, and it was here on a muggy summer's day. At some point in the 20th century, that a peasant pushing his Barrow of countryside filth along a line was astonished to encounter a small child roaring and spitting and growling and scrambling in the muck. Its gender was indeterminate, but it's savagery was unquestionable. The peasant sad to say had the morals of the gutter and a heart as foul as a swamp and he just I did then and there to sell the child to a traveling circus or a zoo. plucking the child from its dick is shoved her onto his Barrow and trundled off towards a larger town where mountebank were known together. But the child bestie or being that she was sink her teeth into the peasants wrist and attacked him in a whirling frenzy of bloodlust. She was knowing the hair off his head, when a kindly doctor arrived on the scene. he patted her on the head and announced their their little one Be not afraid. I am a kindly doctor fascinated by natural philosophy, and I shall take you to my comfortable house and see if over a period of months or years, I can still in you the instill in you the I'm going to start that sentence again. Here is the doctor patting the savage infant on the head and saying they're their little one Be not afraid. I am a kindly doctor, fascinated by natural philosophy. And I shall take you to my comfortable house and see if over a period of months or years, I can instill in you the civilized qualities that were your birthright, but have been stolen from you by no doubt, tragic circumstances. What is your name? The child how old? Ah. Said the kindly doctor. You are inarticulate. That noise you made sounded to me like a combination of a wolf and a bear with perhaps a touch of corncrake I deduce that you have been raised since you were a baby by wolves and bears and corncrakes and may have by bees and Hornets to still you must have a name child. So I shall call you marry Dr. Gold to took the child by the hand and later to his house which stood all alone in the field outside splat. There he dunked her in a disinfectant bath, dressed her in girly clothes and embarked on a comprehensive pedagogical regime. Over the following weeks, he attempted to teach her metaphysics, arithmetic, rhetoric, logic, Latin Greek bread, baking, botany, chemistry, religious instruction, conspiracy theory, merchant banking, astronomy, philology, and the rudiments of table tennis. During this time, reporters from the splat Korea and bugle camped out on his doorstep, filing a series of woefully inaccurate stories about the girl they called the savage infant of splat. Her name spread throughout Europe, and Dr. Gold who received visits from some of the most distinguished intellectuals of the day, including capisco Blunkett and wubi. It was the latter who persuaded the kindly doctor to have the girl baptized by being fully submerged in the sea off the coast of Cornwall, during which baptism she nearly drowned. She entered the booming ocean a savage infant biting and squealing and howling, wrote to the doctor, and she emerged as Mary gold to a good krisztian child.

This is a selective account of course, the doctor makes no mention of the drenched and spluttering tot who was fished out of the water by a passing trauma. Nor does he admit that the good Christian child remained encouraged dribbly savage for the rest of her long, long life. In spite of the doctors lessons, to which he soon added physics, geology, alchemy, pole vaulting, paleontology, entomology, knitting, forensic medicine, vaccinology, Dianetics and pottery, the savage infant of splat became a savage adolescent, and in turn a savage adult. She celebrated her 26th birthday by creeping into Dr. Gold Cruz bedroom as he slept, and smothering him with a pillow. Thereafter, she spent her days crashing around like a wild maniac as the ones comfortable house fell into ruin about her. When she died, craggy and ancient decades later, she had learned nothing except to speak two words, the same two words that remained the extent of the wild boy of Evo Ron's vocabulary, God and milk
