I was thinking of continuing this show seamlessly from last week, but then I decided that it would probably be more prudent to introduce it. So this is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And as ever I'm going to read to you for a while on resonance 104 point four FM live. The reason I thought I would continue seamlessly from last week was that if you were listening, and if you weren't, I sure want a full written excuse why you weren't listening. If you were listening last week, I was talking about dry horses. And on my way home from the studio actually, it occurred to me that the phrase get on dry horse is an anagram of hooting yarders now this has the vexing implication that my average reader or listener is a get mounted on a dry horse. One picture is a rustic lane along with your great gray dry horse is plotting a top which is a get leafing through a copy of granite as punk Tilly Oh rectitude and Pipi bags, perhaps, or listening to my radio show or a pair of headphones jammed into the giffy is now, I don't wish to think of any hooting yard devoted as a gate. Perhaps what we have here is akin to that phenomenon where otherwise staid and reasonable persons turn into psychotic maniacs when they get behind the driving wheel of a car. That was the placid and all together lovely hooting yarder become a gift at the moment of plopping into the saddle of their great great grey horse. I suppose it's possible and a grammatic determinism being what it is, all I can do is plead with my listeners and readers to find for themselves an alternative means of pulling their carts along the country lanes. Many of you will I know be toiling along those very lanes today and tomorrow, in Goblin peasant rags, transporting your cards piled high with rustic muck from one filthy fields to another, or perhaps rolling into a market square at the center of a squalid Hamlet. And what better way to pass the time as the wind house through the branches of larches and pines, than to read a tale from befuddled by cormorants, or to listen on your I Hoot to immorally instructive episode of hooting yard on the air. But doing so need not must not make you a get. So as to your dry horse I beg of you, and if you cannot afford a few Belgian tractor, pull the damn cart yourself.

As a Scribbler on occasionally asked the question, Where do you get your ideas from? Until recently, I would respond with some boilerplate drivel. You know, the kind of thing are newspaper clipping or an overheard snippet of conversation between a pair of ingrates in a bus queue, or a startling and profound insight while eating breakfast into the bewildering complexities of the human condition. Sometimes, I might reply that I've got my ideas while staring vacantly out of the window at the drizzle and the duck pond, or like Emmanuelle can't go to the old tower of liberty. And every now and then if the circumstances were propitious, I would simply ignore the question and instead some my interlocutor on the head with a stick. But none of these not even the last was a wholly satisfactory answer to the question. So I was extremely pleased to stumble upon a chunk of text which Julie memorized, I now recite as if I've just made it up. Whenever I'm asked the source and wellspring of the teeming ideas splattered on an almost daily basis, on the hooting yard website. I quote these words of Margaret Fuller. Behold, the far off the luminary, suspended millions and billions and trillions of miles in space. Then turn the eye yonder, and see that infinitesimal point of vegetation Earth, a speck, countless multitudes of which he Putin piled together would form a point, compared with that majestic, some, yet, behold it move and expand. But it's the long fibrous raise, which that is folgende. org sends down through so many billions of miles to the place of its minute existence. Even as that poor little existence shoots out its fibers to meet those rays which have traveled such great length. So a spirit in the spheres feels the quickening if fulgent rays thrown out by the brain of some prophet or poet, existing millions and billions and trillions of miles away on some distant spirit planet, and his thought expands and enlarges, but he's the warming action of that far off brain until it assumes a shape and form which its own emulation never prophesied. To be precise, these are the words not of the corporeal Margaret Fuller, but of her ethereal spirit, dictated to Henry J. Horn, and transcribed by him in his book, strange visitors, a series of original papers, embracing philosophy, science, government, religion, poetry, art, fiction, satire, humor, narrative and prophecy, by the spirits of Irving Willis, Thackeray, Bronte Richter, Byron, humbled Hawthorne, Wesley browning, and others now dwelling in the spirit world dictated through a clairvoyant, while in an abnormal or trance state, published in 1871, I heartily recommend this very sensible book to all listeners, whether you're a resident on earth or on some other planet or plane of existence. And the full text of the book is in fact online, and there should be a link to it appearing on the hooting yard website shortly. But that piece has not yet appeared online.

So yes, it's all no hoogenraad website that you'll be able to find a link to take you to that great book by Henry J. Horn. And do do visit the site at hooting yard.org for the usual reasons, read read the read the content. Take the opportunity to buy some books. You can subscribe or make a donation donations are always very handy. And I occasionally mentioned that those who download this podcast may wish to send me a few a few quid or a few dollars. Every little helps. And yeah, you know, you get this for free. So why not? Thomas the Quincy. The real Thomas de Quincey as opposed to his ethereal spirit wrote a piece called the Spanish military nun, which was published in 1854. And includes this Ah, what a beautiful idea occurs to me at this point. Once on the hustings at Liverpool, I saw a mob orator whose brawling mouth opened which widest expansion, suddenly some locking sailor by the most dexterous of shots, plugged up with a paving stone. Here now at Valladolid was another mouth That equally required plugging. What a pity then that some gay brother page of Kate had not been there to turn aside into the room armed with a roasted potato and taking a sportsman's aim to have lodged it in the crocodiles abominable mouth, yet was an anachronism. There were no roasted potatoes in Spain at that date 1608 which can be apo, dialectically proved. Because in Spain, there were no potatoes at all, and very few in England. But anger drives the man to say anything

to provide listeners with an exciting activity project to keep them busy. And this week's exciting activity project is to spruce up your mud idle. It is probably languishing, neglected, matted with dust and cobwebs and harried by bats up in your attic. So, before I carry on, you'd better go and fetch it.

Mission accomplished. Excellent. Now the first thing to do is to count the nails frenziedly driven into the mud idle. When you were in a state of trance. You will want to ensure that none are missing. But in order to recall the exact number of nails you hammered into the idol while chanting mesmeric gibberish, you will have to go back into a trance. Prepare to seyn of boiling milk and leaves and twigs and bogs and sprinkle it with icing sugar and eggy fragments. Play a tape recording of wild winds howling across the remote tar pooter and grab the potion in one go. Try not to vomit yet. If all goes well, your brain should become be designed and hallucinatory within a few minutes, and the magic number of nails will pop into your head. Write it down on a scrap of paper. Turn off the tape recorder and go for a long and strenuous hike to clear the fog inside your bonds. When you return refreshed, count the nails to ensure they match the number you scribbled down. If any nails are missing, spiritual panic would be an understandable response. But it's important that you remain absolutely calm. You will have to forget about any idea of sprucing up your mud idol and instead concentrate on burying it deep in the earth and preferably in a lead lined casket as soon as possible. When you've done that, using a special spade, you must try to find the missing nail or nails. Until you do so your soul will remain in the utmost peril. If and when you find the nails, place them in a bath of the most powerful acid legally available in your village. If on the other hand, you cannot track them down, get on your knees and pray. Pray like the clappers, it will be your only hope. Still, we mustn't be pessimistic, the likelihood is that your mad idol will still have driven into it the original number of nails and you will be able to spruce it up in jus accordance with this week's exciting activity project guidelines. You may wish to listen to the tape recording of the wild wind howling across the remote top pooter as you do so. So get a duster and a rag and some proprietary polished. I recommend Brian Ito's sparkly rubber dub dub foam based the smearing agent. Use the dust vigorously to remove all traces of filth and muck from both the mud idle and it's piercing nails. Then give it a good Polish with the rag there. It's all spruced up, and you could place it on your window sill or mantle piece and bow down to it in fear and trembling until the cows come home

Now that you've spruced up your mad idol, you're probably in the mood to spruce up a few of your other appurtenances. You might have noticed that your hands are looking a bit tatty, it's difficult to work out why this is so although the neglect into which you've allowed their coop to Boulder may have something to do with it, it will probably be a good idea to spruce up the hen coop once you have spruced up the hens themselves, but that's a project for another day one when it's not raining incessantly. And when a cold wind is not lashing across the yard, in a corner of which the coop has been shoved, ramshackle and near to collapse. The best way to spruce up a hen is to paint it feathers with henna, obviously, prepare a large tub of henna and get a paintbrush. Holding the hand in one hand, paint each individual feather with henna and then replace the hand in the hand coop. Repeat until all your hands have been spruced up. It may be that being painted in rages one or more of your hands. And you may now suffer from lacerations made by their fierce beaks. dab some sort of gooey antiseptic ointment upon the lacerations swayed them in bandages, and go and lie down in a darkened room. But before you do, so, don't forget to clean the tub and the brushes with hot soapy water. If you do not have any hot water or soap, you must be a filthy and unprepossessing person. quite unlike your hens, which are now smartly spruced up with henna passers by if there are any, we'll do a double take wondering how grimy a specimen as yourself has managed to accumulate a coop's worth of such lovely hens. By such dis junctures is the world made that little bit more intriguing.

Time now? kitchen craft in the amilia of prohibition era, gang land is a neglected topic. So we must be grateful to hoagie velikovsky pipsqueak professor of organized crime and kitchen craft at the University of slop for his thumping great tome. gumshoes mortar mobsters pestle, recently reissued with corrections. This is film noir territory, and the prof demonstrates convincingly that the mortars and pestles of gumshoes and mobsters were invariably black or white or Shades of Grey, and that both mortars and pestles being solid object cast shadows, which in this context could often be eerie and even expressionists indeed, is opening chapter is devoted entirely to kicking shadows. In some cases, a gumshoe is lurking in a kitchen shadow, waiting to put the heat on a mobster in others, or mobster hygiene kitchen shadow prepper Krita socking a gumshoe with a blackjack. There are even occasions when the kitchen shadows are empty, concealing nothing for both gumshoe and mobster are absent. velikovsky is very good at evoking the suspense inherent in an unattended mortar and pestle resting on a kitchen table or countertop. We know something is true to be crushed and ground, but we do not yet know what manner of thing it might be. We know too, that at some point, both the gumshoe and the mobster will enter the kitchen separately or together and flit between light and shadow. Armed perhaps not only with that Ross goes but fresh from grocery shopping with a bag of caraway seeds or arrow root biscuits ready to be crushed. The gum tree will almost serve suddenly have patronized a legal grocery, whereas the mobster will have made his purchases on the black market. It is a pity that the prof does not spend more time discussing contraband caraway seeds, and illegal arrowroot biscuits for this would be fertile ground. He does have a few paragraphs, however, on the near identical brown paper bags in which both seeds and biscuit would be ferried from grocery or black market to the shadowy kitchen. We're in the mortar and pestle or white, inert and inanimate, yet somehow throbbing with potential violence. Just as the gumshoe and the mobster themselves, violent men by necessity so throb. velikovsky reflects too on the mutual dependence, the duality of gumshoe and mobster and mortar and pestle. The one cannot have any meaningful existence without the other in a passage of sparkling prose, which I'm sure will find its way into many an anthology of kitchen craft writing, he posits a second or jewel duality that of gum shoe and mortar and mobster and pestle. Curiously, he does not extend this conceit to the further combination of mobster and mortar and gumshoe and pestle. I suspect his failure to do so is due to deep and intractable psychological horrors, that like of which frighten the horses. Horses, so essential to the Western genre, are almost entirely absent from the film noir world. Yet in terms of kitchen craft, there are many parallels, and we are as likely to come upon mortars and pestles in a tumble down wild west shacks kitchen, outside which our horse is tied to a post as we are along the mean film noir streets down which a man must go in order to make his way to his kitchen. Indeed, without a mortar and pestle, one wonders how the cowboy might crash and grind to a digestible consistency. The grainy content of his horses nose bag, this is a topic Professor hoagie velikovsky may wish to explore in a forthcoming book.

Those of you who have been reading hooting Owl and listening to hooting out on the air for at least a year may remember if you've been making notes that a couple of days time it's grunting day, and also potato day, international potato day. And so we've had a bit about potatoes with the the Quincy anachronistic roasted potato in Spain in the early 17th century. And now we have some advice on grunting. This is courtesy of a website called the cat's meat shop. And I think it's by a man called lead Jackson, I may have that wrong, in which case I apologize, which basically gathers together some fantastic Victorian texts about all sorts of things. And I actually failed to make a note of the exact source of this, of what follows but it's from some kind of Victorian manual of child care, I think, anyway gives extremely detailed advice on how to grunt in a particular context which will become clear. This is very very useful, particularly for those listeners with small children. Take the baby hand in one of yours spread out the hand point to the thumb and say decidedly yet confining Lee one this little pig went to market grunt and let it be an ordinary pigs grunt point to the next finger and In the deepest base you can assume to this little pig stayed at home, give a morose base grunt and frown. Point to the next finger and say with an insinuating tone and smile, elevating your eyebrows and bowing three, this little pig had roast beef and add three quick little grunts of satisfaction. Point to the next finger and say, in a voice just ready to cry for this little pig had none. Give too low grunts of weariness, and look ready to cry. Then, pointing to the little finger, say very pleasantly, in a shrill, droll voice laughing. Meanwhile, this little pig, cried, tweak, tweak, tweak, pinching and twirling the child's finger gently, as if you had hold of the pig's tail. This makes a complete harmless drama of the story of the pigs and rouses babies feelings, sensations, and ideas in a healthy manner. five distinct emotions are raised one interest to fear, three pleasure or sympathy for grief, almost to tears, five, a sudden reversion to mirth and all's well that ends well, a great dessert or Artem in baby estimation. We must remember to that the feelings during babyhood are ephemeral in the extreme light and evanescent.

Well, I hope you've taken that advice. I certainly found it very, very helpful to learn how to do different types of granting. And don't forget that whenever when if you do have a small child and and do this little pig went to market with it, don't forget to evoke grief, almost tears at stage four. Very important. Right, that's it for this week. I haven't got anything else to say. So I'm just going to go now and I'll be back next week with some other stuff. Whether or not there'll be anything more about dry horses, potatoes or grunting pigs. We will find out then. Bye bye.
