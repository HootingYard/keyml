In order to fully appreciate white man and Hammersmith palai, a song written and recorded by the clash in 1978, which you've just heard, we must get a firm grasp upon the words in the title. Before we do so, let me be quite clear that I'm gonna pay no attention whatsoever to the parentheses, in my view, and I grant that I may be an error here. Placing white man in parentheses is a mere affectation and has no significance whatsoever. The truth of this can be underlined by removing the parentheses and judging if it makes any difference, vast, open bracket, white man closed brackets in Hammersmith, palai or they're gone. White man in Hammersmith palay I challenge anybody to insert a very, very thin thing, like a cigarette paper between the two. We might have press on indomitably. White. What do you mean? What do we mean by what? Is it a color or as some would have it the absence of color, the white of an egg, the albumin is more translucent than white in its raw state. But fry the egg in a pan, and voila, it is indeed white. By the way, it would be a mistake to infer from this that all fried things are white, most are not. To gain a sense of overwhelming whiteness. It is well worth reading the closing passages of the narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe. If you read it while drinking a glass of milk, the effect of whiteness will be redoubled. If In addition, you take the entire contents of a tub of talcum powder over your head, and look up from your book from time to time into a mirror, you will be left in no doubt about what white means. Next, man, man is the male of the spate species of Homo sapiens. In most cases, he is a bipedal but not invariably. For example, Ian Anderson, the front man, man of the band dressed rotel prefers to stand on one leg when playing his flute. He is vast, at least temporarily, a monopod. What else can we say usefully about a man? Well, for one thing, we can differentiate between types of men chloral. By placing a qualifying adjective before man, this might be in the form of a prefix jammed up against man with no space between, as for example, Frenchman, or post man, or it might be a discrete separate interchangeable word, as in grunty, man or stricken man. off the coast of England, there is a place called the Isle of Man, but we better avoid that, particularly as its flag is a triskelion of three armored legs. That is one and a half standard issued by Pitbull men, or three Jethro Tull flautists the thought of which begins to disease the brain. So we're looking at the title of the clashes white man in Hammersmith, Palais, word by word, and then next week I'm in white man in Hammersmith, palai. In we can dispatch fairly rapidly, it's a short word indicating that something is contained within something else. For example, the talcum powder was in the tub before we are painted over our head. Now, the talcum powder is no longer in the tub. It really is as simple as that. Just be careful not to confuse in AI n with in AI, n n. The latter is a tavern or hostelry. If a man enters one, parched and thirsty and covered in talcum powder, he is said to be in an in. Conversely, if he engages in fisticuffs with another customer, because he is teased for being covered in talcum powder, he risks being thrown out of the in

the chances of this happening or more likely, if in the end, he drinks a sufficient quantity of beer to be in his cups. This does not mean he is literally inside a cup or several cups. As the plural suggests. It is a figure of speech. We're not going to go further down the road of figures of speech because quite frankly is exasperating enough having to explain all this stuff to you just so you can grasp fully The title of a punk single from almost 40 years ago, I have better things to do with my time. So let's wrap this up as soon as we can. Hammersmith, this is a proper name referring to an area of London, London, spelled l o n D o n is usually pronounced London. But for amusement sake, it is better pronounced as it looks, with the two arms equally stressed, as if one was say the word on. This is particularly the case when responding to queries from tourists vacantly wandering the streets of London born. Now, natives of London, my well pronounced Hammersmith as Amma Smith, depending on their social class. As the son of a globe trotting Foreign Office diplomat, Joe Strummer, the front man of the clash, would have been brought up to say Hammersmith rather than Emma Smith. Incidentally, I hope I did not give the impression earlier that all front men in band stand on one leg while playing the flute. That is true of Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. So far as I know, it's not true of Joe Strummer of the clash. But again, I grant that I may be wrong, and if any listeners can provide photographic evidence to the contrary, I'll be happy to issue a correction. You will know that hammer Smith is a conjunction of two words hammer and Smith. A Smith might use a hammer when beating say a horseshoe into the required shape at his anvil. Once upon a time, this was so widely practiced to trade that Smith is a common surname, hammer lesson. Instances of the former are too numerous to mention that we can give one time Wimbledon champion Stan Smith as an example. As for the latter, we might note the American hip hop artist MC Hammer, a man who has reportedly confessed to a fear of hammers. As with Strummer hammer is not known for mano poudel flute playing. Last and not before time we come to palay. You will recall in our discussion of man that we mentioned a Frenchman It so happens that a Frenchman says palay where his English equivalent would say, Paris. Usually a palace or palay is the sort of building inhabited by the likes of Prince for Geneseo. Hammersmith Palais or Amma Smith palace is or was not that kind of palette. Rather, it was a place where young persons would gather on mass in a sort of mosh pit and Dysport themselves in an often ungainly manner, while listening to loud music, or, as some might have it, a god awful racket. There was at least one occasion when principal genteel himself left his palace or Pele to enter a mosh pit, where he galumphing about in the presence of a band of troubadours led by a man standing on one leg playing a flute, but glasses a tale for another time. It needs to be hope that you now have a greater understanding of white man in Hammersmith Pammi by the clash. Next week, we'll examine I close my eyes and count to 10 by Dusty Springfield, for your preparatory homework. Please read Dobson's pamphlet, arithmetic for the blind out of print.

Well, I hope you found that you For part of our series of explaining the titles of pop songs, and we're going to move on now to some extracts from Mr. Keys, shorter, potted brief, brief lives, which published by Constable, which came out almost a year ago, and so far has not sold in sufficient quantities for me to retire to a tropical island. So but if you're listening, go and buy several more copies. Andrew motion, English poet born 1952 Andrew motion suggests, sorry, Andrew motion summons the poetic Muse by drinking Lemsip, which tricks his brain into feeling slightly ill and self pitying. And apparently he thinks it is a very good way of writing poetry. Dry Henry Mowbray, an American writer of the 20th century. Mowbray was the author of the 1912 book with a terrific title as follows. sinking of the Titanic most appalling ocean horror, with graphic descriptions of hundreds swept to eternity beneath the waves, panic stricken multitude facing shore death, and thrilling stories of this most overwhelming catastrophe, to which is added vivid accounts of heart rending scenes when hundreds were doomed to watery grave compiled from soul stirring stories told by eyewitnesses of this terrible horror of the briny deep. That's the kind of title you want, isn't it? And that's also considered a lot a wick Magilton, an English Mughal Tony in 1609 to 1698. In 1652, a lot of wick Muggleton and his cousin john Reeve received a commission from God who told them they were the two witnesses referred to in the book of revelations, Chapter 11, verse three, they were empowered to pronounce upon the fate of individuals and to curse for all eternity, those so deserving, such as Scotsman foam Magilton had a pathological loading. They gathered followers and formed the sect, Mughal antonians believed that human reason was unclean, and this led them to reject physical science. They refuse to accept the laws of gravity or the rules of mathematics, and they considered astronomy to be wrong. The stars they said, were only as big as God made them appear from Earth. In later years, Mazel Tov nians banned hot air ballooning, because the balloons would crash into the sky, a solid band around the Earth other than the Quakers, but Muggleton Ian's were the only sector that sprang up in the foment of the English Civil War, to survive into the 20th century. In the 1970s. One, Philip Noakes came to light in Kent, a living Mughal toniann in possession of a huge archive of material covering their entire history.

And a few more brief lives. Benito Mussolini, Italian statesman 1883 to 1945 Mussolini had a terror of moonlight touching his face when he was asleep. Eadweard Muybridge, English photographer 1830 to 1904 you all know my bridges, photographs it's all those kind of multiple photographs of people and animals in motion. Eadweard Muybridge his wife Bora son, Flora shadow heavy off when Muybridge discovered he was not the father, and that the child had been sired by a notorious confidence trickster named George Harry Larkins. He tracked malarkey down and shot him dead. In spite of. In spite of admitting the murder, Muybridge was acquitted. One of his favorite snacks was maggot riddled cheese. JOHN mitem English rake 1796 to 1834. Mad jack mitten was a sign of a family which dated its nobility, back to the Plantagenets. His father died when he was 18 months old, and he inherited in and he inherited a vast estate with a huge annual income. By the time he died in debtors prison at the age of 38, the estate had been sold and he was penulis. mitten enjoyed going on winter Duck Hunt, stripped to the waist or completely naked, lying in snowdrifts awaiting his prey. Once when he had hiccups, he cured them by setting fire to the shirt he was wearing. His death was ascribed to disease of the brain. The Polian, French Emperor 1769 to 1821 Napoleon's handwriting was such an illegible scroll, but the letters he sent from Germany to the Empress Josephine Well, first thought to be roughly sketched maps. And finally in this segment, Ronaldo, Luis Navara Ronaldo, Luis Nazario De Lima, Brazilian footballer born 1976 during a football match in 2009, referring to a footballer named Rolando, a television commentator wondered how long is it since Ronaldo was marked by an anagram of himself?

Is it sometimes appropriate to signal a want of sausages in semi for, for example, you might find yourself sausage lists in the middle of a desolate plain, some sort of biblical wilderness, ravenous for sausages, but happily in possession of two brightly colored flags. If you have a smattering of semaphore, and a broad knowledge of sausage types, it should not be beyond your wit, to signal your wants of sausages. Using the flag to a distant past or by whether this pass or by will be able to satisfy your saucy journalist is of course, quite another matter. We should also take into account the very distinct possibility that such a signaling is beyond your wit, in short, that you are witless, or if not entirely witless, then a half wait. Standing about in the middle of a plane with a couple of flags, yet bereft of sausages is the sort of behavior we might expect from a half with half wits and done the pates are not the best people when it comes to accurate and reliable center for signals. Indeed, they can become so muddle headed in their attempts to deploy a pair of flags according to a well established code, but their message is likely to be gibberish. This will leave the distant past by scratching their head in confusion and deciding to continue on this stroll along the edge of the plane, perhaps Muhlenberg Heath with their dog in tow. Most dogs can sniff out sausages with bewildering acuity. There are even some dogs known as sausage dogs. It can all become very complicated, especially if you were a half weight

And I think we're better this week and hooting out this week with some further science. This is taken from further science book 20 by Norman Davis published in 2001. Bird greenness age table one, that while the oldest living birds are the long tail, long migration, swallows and turns, etc. sleek fast with some of the largest birds to these are followed by short factor ducks and crows, heavy, rough, tough, slow, medium sized land, water. Three, then come the thrushes static territorial, followed by the day night birds of prey predators for then geese, followed by seed eating finches, and tents and elegant doves and wagtails. Five tree birds have briefer lives, woodpeckers, tree creepers, not hatch flycatchers pipits redstarts, great htet, bulfinch, Kingfisher, et cetera six, with the least long living being the smallest reigns, and gold crest, etc. Well, I hope that's given you a great insight into bird genus age tables. There'll be possibly more from Norman Davis next week. It is the greatest book I've ever read. I may or may not tell you about. I can't close my eyes and count to 10 by Dusty Springfield. And I might even read you some more brief lives. But that will be next week. I hope you've enjoyed this week's show. And that's all for this week. Bye bye.

laughs like that, isn't it? me the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers and wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
