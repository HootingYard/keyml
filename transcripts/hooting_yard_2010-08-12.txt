Good evening, this is indeed hooting yard. With me Frank key the last show before resonances, two weeks summer break. And I should take this opportunity actually to say thank you to a few people. on previous shows over the last few weeks, I've suggested that particularly podcast listeners, for some reason, should listeners to the podcast, if they will wish to say thank you by making a donation to hooting yard, that that would be much appreciated because you get hours and hours and hours of this stuff for no charge whatsoever. And some people have which has been very nice, so thank you to them. I didn't make a note of their names, because I was going to thank them personally. But then I left that at home. So sorry about that. But just to let those of you who did donate to the hooting yard fund for distressed pamphleteers that it really is genuinely appreciated. Thank you very much if you haven't donated but would like to just go to the hooting yard website and have a have a read and have a look around. And then click the Pay Pal button. Okay, enough of that, but I just wanted to say thank you. Regular listeners will know that I occasionally Stop babbling my own prose and read something by someone else. And today I would like to read a chapter from a 1965 book by Hesketh Pearson, called extraordinary people. heska Pearson In fact, died the previous year. So this is a posthumous publication. He was an actor and writer and probably the most popular biographer in English in the sort of mid 20th century he wrote, lots and lots and lots of biographies. Tom Paine, Bernard Shaw, Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde, and so on. extraordinary people is a collection of shorter biographical portraits or potted biographies. And one of them is is short enough to read an entire chapter. So I found it very amusing. I like this tone, and I think you will too. This is the chapter in extraordinary people by Hesketh Pearson, entitled, looking for love. The famous French philosopher Rousseau has much to answer for. Like many great reformers, he experienced no difficulty in living on the fat of the land, either finding women to look after him or cash to support him. He was in a sense the father of the present age, for he popularized the profession of humanitarianism. Unable to feel much affection for individuals, many of whom he treated very shabbily, he pleaded the cause of humanity so fervently, that the world has followed his lead with the inevitable result that nowadays, nobody is considered because everybody is concerned. No one in history so so clearly illustrated the truth, that most high minded attempt to be altruistic derive from excessive egotism. One of his earliest and most enthusiastic disciples was an Englishman, Thomas day, in tracing whose life we may watch a sprout from Rousseau seed before it flowered into the modern state. Day was born in London on the 22nd of June 1748, and educated Charterhouse in Oxford. He inherited a comfortable income from his father, and though his mother married again, he continued to support her. Like most people who are not fond of their fellow creatures. He early displayed a lot of animals, and would have been a vegetarian. If he had not felt that cows, sheep and pigs were only kept alive in order to be eaten, and that a short life of indulgent fattening was better than no life at all.

He was not popular at the university, because his habit of drinking nothing stronger than water was regarded by the oxonian. As of that time, as unhealthy and priggish wishing to work for the good of mankind. He began the study of medicine, in the belief that he could save more people He would kill. But much study left him skeptical on the point and he turned his attention to the law. He thought that bad laws produced bad people, and he wished to purge the legal system of its feudal anachronisms, but he soon perceived that the job was beyond his powers, and he dallied with the idea of politics. Having met several members of parliament and witnessed a few debates in that assembly, he came to the conclusion that nothing useful could be done in such a profession. So he considered the question of marriage. Here Surely, in this more restricted field was a means of putting Rousseau's theories into practice. his ideals were lofty, the wife for whom he was looking, must possess certain virtues. purity, of course, that went without saying, extreme fortitude, great courage, absolute simplicity of nature, innocence, modesty, and indifference to dress, a dislike of mere pleasure, a love of literature and interest in science, a taste for moral philosophy, and wisdom beyond her sex and an unqualified devotion to himself. Only So, only so country be the worthy mother of his children, whose mind he intended to mold. Further, she must be content to live with him in complete retirement, far from the homes of fashion, or as he put it sequestered in some secret Grove. With this picture of female accomplishments in his mind, he went wife hunting, a friend, Richard level edgeworth took him to Ireland, where he was introduced to edgeworth sister, but day's personal appearance and behavior were against him. He was untidy in dress, he never brushed his hair. His manners were uncouth, his gait was awkward. Moreover, he denounced women, and it is doubtful whether Miss edgeworth viewed the prospect of permanent residence in a secret Grove with equanimity. Day made several more attempts to find a woman who united all the qualities he desired, but none of those he met came up to standard, and at length he determined to train a wife from infancy. He had a firm belief in the efficacy of education, and was justice convinced that he could produce a good wife by teaching her the philosophy of Rousseau, as many modern statesmen are convinced that they can produce good citizens by teaching them the economics of Marx.

His method of finding an embryonic wife was as follows. He visited the Foundling Hospital at Shrewsbury, and from amongst the Pratt, the prattling inmates thereof, he selected a brunette, aged 11, whom he named Sabrina. Then he called that the Foundling Hospital of London, and chose a blonde aged 12, who be named Lucretia. he undertook to give them a year's trial, at the end of which he would apprentice one of them to a trade, retaining the other for education and ultimate marriage. During the process of education, he solemnly engaged never to violate her innocence. Finding that people in London misunderstood his intentions. He took the two girls to France, where he began to inoculate them with the doctrines of Rousseau. But their reactions to the treatment what unfavorable like quarreled with one another incessantly, and teased him beyond insurance, like smallpox, and made his life a misery by yelling for him at all hours of the night. He saved them from drowning, and challenged a French officer to a jewel, because you showed an interest in them. Eight months of this were more than enough for day, who brought them back to England apprenticed the intractable Lucretia to a milliner and took Sabrina with him to Litchfield, in order to be near his philosophic and scientific friend, Dr. Erasmus Darwin. Sabrina was now a remarkably pretty girl, and they decided that that time had come to test her fortitude and bravery, his wife would have to be equal to any emergency once they were cut off from all human help in a secret Grove, and the methods he adopted were carefully chosen to prove her immunity from physical and mental cowardice. Having warned her that she must expect to suffer some inconvenience. He lives a piece of sealing wax, and allowed the molten drops to fall upon her arms and neck. She was not equal to the occasion, but screamed like any ordinary girl. He had to face that fit the fact that physical courage was not her strong point. Yeah, there might be some hope for her if she could withstand the fear of danger, so he tried another experiment, assuring her that he was a good shot and had no intention of maiming her for life. He placed a blank cartridge in his pistol, which he aimed in the direction of her legs and fired. Again, she failed to come up to his expectations, and instead of smiling serenely let off a howl of fear. He tried again and again. But every explosion of the pistol made her jump and ejaculate, it was most disappointing, but he did not abandon hope until he had tested her with a number of less potent experiments. And if he had thigma, signally failed to enjoy them with stoicism. Then he packed her off to a boarding school and paid his attention to a local beauty or a snide. But his method of lovemaking, even without the aid of pistol and sealing wax, did not appeal to Nora, who had her own notion of women's rights and did not fancy a life dedicated to moral philosophy and and diluted Thomas day, she turned him down, and within within a few weeks, he was courting her sister, Elizabeth. Here he was on firmer ground for Elizabeth not only disliked dancing and many other fringe qualities which we have dominated, but love to hear him talk, and even viewed without dismayed the prospect of life sequestered in some secret Grove. In her eyes, the only thing against him was his personal appearance and his lack of social polish. She declared that he must smarten himself up and cultivate an elegant department. He agreed to do so if she in the meantime would study philosophy. leaving her with a long list of books to get through during his absence, he departed for France in order to acquire social polish.

While she tortured her mind at home, he tortured his limbs abroad. For seven or eight hours a day he danced and fenced and tried to make his joints flexible by strenuous artificial contortions. I have seen him route edgeworth stand between two boards, which reach from the ground higher than his knees. These boards were adjusted with screws so as to barely permit him to bend his knees, and to rise up and sink down. But original formation and inveterate habit, resisted all his endeavors at personal improvement. I could not help pitying my philosophic friend pent up in durance vile for hours together, with his feet in the stocks, a book in his hand and contempt in his heart. His efforts to acquire social elegance were unsatisfactory, and when he returned to Litchfield genteel society laughed at him. His showy dress did not suit his ungainly figure, is studied bow and artificial pose were less attractive than his natural clumsiness. Elizabeth preferred his early slovenliness and declined to marry him. They left Litchfield and went to live in the temple, he never practiced as a barrister, this time being mostly spent in reading and writing. Like the majority of professed humanitarians. He was more sensitive to the sufferings of the animal, bird and insect worlds than to those of his fellow beings. Day set a legal friend to him kill that spider. No, replied day, I don't know that I have a right. Suppose that a superior being said to a companion, kill that lawyer. How should you like it? And a lawyer is more noxious to most people than a spider. Sabrina had she been present would have envied the spider. True to the creed of Rousseau de was violently opposed to any form of slavery outside his own home, and he wrote a poem, but dying negros lament, which no doubt watered the eyes and hardened the hearts of many a domestic tyrant. His main contribution to letters, however, was a work entitled Sandford and Merton, upon which three generations of British school boys were nurtured. It shows how good boys ought to behave and what happens to bad boys, and was therefore more popular with parents that with children while making a reputation in the literary world, day gave Sabrina one more chance. She was now a very beautiful women, woman, and his friend edgeworth failed to understand how he could resist one who was physically so attractive. But day was made of sterner stuff. He demanded above everything, an absolute an unselfish devotion to himself. He was willing to overlook her proved weakness and cowardice, if only her abject obedience could be relied upon. To prove this, he made a final experiment. She had a taste for pretty dresses and handling and had been indulging in fashionable finery. So he told her that this must cease and explained exactly what she must wear. He then left her at the house of a friend, but his notion of utility clothing clashed with her sense of what suited her figure, and she began to decorate herself once more, the moment the sound of his carriage wheels died away. On hearing this, he cast her off forever, with a pension of 50 pounds a year. Eventually, she married an elderly rule a named Bicknell, by whom she had two children. Meanwhile, a friend of days named Dr. Small, a popular member of the Luna society, told him of a certain Miss millones, who, in the doctor's opinion, would make him a perfect wife, but asked a actually whitened large arms she has, does she wear long petticoats uncommonly long? I hope she is tall and strong and healthy. Remarkably little and not robust, replied the doctor, who quickly enumerated her many desirable qualifications, saying that she had a superior understanding, a charming nature, a benevolent mind, a good character, a large fortune, and views that were congenial with those of day. My dear doctor rejoined day, the only serious objection which I have to miss Milnes is her large fortune. It was always my wish to give to any woman who married the most unequivocal proof of my attachment to herself by despising her fortune. Well, my dear friend, said doctor small, what prevents you from despising the fortune and taking the Lady

Day traveled to Yorkshire saw Miss Mills liked her, and it once began a discussion of the many knotty points on which it was necessary that they should agree before living together in harmony. The argument lasted for several years by correspondence and conversation. When at length that situation was sufficiently clarified or obscured for them to be at one on every conceivable subject, from poetry to petticoats from metaphysics to medicine, from architecture to Apple dumplings, their marriage took place. Having instilled in his wife all the principles of his own mind camp, de then became a Hitler in the home. When she fell ill, he forced her to take strenuous pedestrian exercise, whatever the weather, when she wanted to hear or play music, he forbade it. When she wish to see her friends or write to them, he would not permitted, she was allowed no servant, no carriage, no luxury of any kind. He made frequent experiments to try her affection, which often reduced her to tears. He built an addition to their house, absent mindedly omitting a window for her dressing room, and for years, she dressed by candlelight. They talked endlessly about everything under the sun, or rather, he talked, and she agreed. Fortunately for the children, they had no children. Though he expressed an utter contempt for most human beings, he's spoken rose in favor of the extension of the franchise, never bothering to explain why people who were worthless should not be vote plus, he bought a farm in sorry with the main object of getting away from what he called the stink of human society. Having obtained all the textbooks on agriculture, and studied them carefully, he set to work and made a complete mess of it. Every Sunday, the laborers came to his house, and he imparted moral instruction. He paid them better wages in winter than in summer, because they required more comfort in the cold weather. This made him very unpopular with the neighboring farmers who did the opposite. his belief was animals could be controlled by kindness caused his death at the age of 41. On the 28th of September 1789, he mounted an untrained horse and set off to visit his mother. The horse shy that something near wargrave would not respond to kindness, and de was flung to the ground on his head. His wife survived him for two years, spending most of the time in bed, perhaps worn out by the enforced energy of life with Thomas. And so perished this disciple of Rousseau, this domestic totalitarian, a man whose idealistic nature made life So difficult for others, and so on easy for himself.

Fantastic little potted biography that that was Thomas day by Hesketh Pearson from his book. extraordinary people. Yes, very good. Something else I'll read recently was this quotation in a letter from Thomas Lovell beddoes 1803 to 1849 and a letter he wrote in January 1825, to Thomas Forbes Kelsall. The fatal dowry has been cobbled I see by some purblind ultra crappy Darien, McCready, his friend Walker very likely, but nevertheless, I maintained is a good play, and might have been rendered very effective by document of the whole fifth fact, which is an excrescence, recreating noval and making bow mail a great deal more ghost gaping and moonlight ish. The Kurt Taylor has taken out the most purple piece in the whole web, the end of the fourth act, and shoulders himself into toleration through the prejudices of the pit, when he should have built his admiration on their next Say what you will, I am convinced, the man who is to awaken the drama must be a bold, trampling fellow, like creeper into wormholes, no reviver, even however good these re animations of vampire cold, such ghosts as Marlo Webster, and so on, a better dramatists, better poets, I dare say, than any contemporary of ours, but they're ghosts. The worm is in their pages, and we want to see something that our grand grand great grand sighs did not know. With the greatest reverence for all the Antiquities of the drama. I still think that we've had better beget than revive attempt to give the literature of this age and idiosyncrasy and spirit of its own, and only raise a ghost to gaze on not to live with. Just now the drama is a haunted ruin. McCready his friend Walker was not the only purblind out for Chrebet arion cobbling plays on the theatrical stage 200 years ago. There were others non more energetic than producer, director, actor, playwright, stage manager, impresario dramaturge and scene shifter, Jarvis grease collar damn near forgotten today, for the first two decades of the 19th century he had in George Bernard Shaw, his words, the advantage of a celebrity that is not idolatry, and a regard that is untainted by a secret appearance of the angry ape posing as a gold, although sure was writing about somebody else. Greek collar made his name with the production in a crumbling theater in a seaside town of the thick fog, a one act play, he probably wrote himself, although some claim it to be an adaptation of Azure d'esprit by swatting he followed it at another crumbling theater in another seaside town with the impenetrable mist. This timer to act play, adapted certainly from one of sausages opera booths, critics from the capital city hearing of the unprecedented enthusiasm of seaside theater goers flocked to the coast to see for themselves. Seldom has so purblind and out for crap it arion cobbled such a play at the seaside crowd. The anonymous critic of the weekly Starling showered with offers to open his next production big important theatres in the capital. Grease collar declined and moved further along the coast. In a theater so crumbled that it was open to the elements he unveiled. Own tenebrous gloom, a three act play with a cast of hundreds. It opens with the memorable lines. cold hearted orb that rules the night removes the colors from our site. Red is gray, and yellow white. But we decide which is right. And which is an illusion. A declaration that was to inspire for a long haired Airheads a century and a half later Following this triumph Greek scholar was given a knighthood, and married his leading lady Edith seabag. herself no mean ultra crappy Darien, though she was never purblind. she collaborated

with him on several later plays, including the foul Blizzard chasm of death, the little Incy Wincy bunny rabbits, and croaks from a plague pit. In 1821, for unfathomable reasons, Java's Greek scholars star waned, and not a theater in the land would stage nor cobble one of his productions. He fell out with Swati in Georgia mysterious calamity and yet another seaside town, and his wife ran off with a dapper gentleman of foreign extraction. Years later, she was to play a shadowy role as a counter revolutionary in the revolutionary turmoil that engulfed a continent. In 1837, by now in quite a disgusting state grease collar was found sprawled on a pebbly beach, howling, the cold hearted or, sorry at the moon. He was carted off to an asylum, where he died at the advanced age of 122. On the day of Queen Victoria's funeral, in 1901, a purblind ultra crafted arion to the last he toppled from his earthly socket into the dust. He left behind an unfinished manuscript written in the asylum, his final play, toppling into the dust. It has never been performed, nor cobbled, nor even read.

I'm not not very long before the end of the show, but I just probably ought to read this before the summer break because it gets older and older. This was written a couple of months ago. And I mentioned on the hooting odd blog that I don't often contribute to the comments threads on blogs that I read. Whether this is a character flaw or a virtue, I'm not sure, probably sheer idleness. However, up bright and early one day, I turned to Peter Hitchens, latest postage over at the Mail Online, and I came upon this sentence. Seeing several of Mary Renault's books at bargain prices, I stuffed them in my backpack and began reading as it happened. The king must die as I waited for a delayed train on a country platform. I couldn't let this pass without comment. So on Peter Hitchens, his blog, I commented, Mr. Hitchens, I really must take issue with your use of the word backpack, it becomes you backpack is a barbaric neologism used by young persons, often those on so called gap years. In future please ensure you use one of the three Yes, three acceptable alternatives. rucksack have a sack or knapsack. And I regret to say that Peter Hitchens, although he engages robustly with his readers has not seen fit to apologize for this. Although some of the other commentators thought that I was bonkers. Well, there you go. Have a good summer. No, have a good two weeks while resonance is off the air. I'll be back after that. Go to the blog. hooting yard.org and yeah, that's that's it for this season and bye bye.
