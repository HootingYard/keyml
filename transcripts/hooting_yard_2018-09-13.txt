Hello and welcome back to hooting yard on the air. My name is Frankie, and I'm sucking a throat lozenge which is not a good start. I thought I would. I thought the whole thing not a fisherman's friend, not a fisherman's friend. I thought the whole thing might have dissolved by the time it got to six o'clock. But sadly, no. And having said that, that that makes clear that this is a live show. Live from London back for its umpteenth season. Yes. hooting out on the air is a show where basically I read stories and other stuff. And you listen, and that's how it goes. Often. I've been told that babies fall asleep to the sound of my voice. And I wouldn't be surprised if number of adults do too. So sit back, put your head on a pillow and drop off and we'll we'll make some kind of plaques on noise to wake you up at 629 in time for the next show. This is about scarecrows Hang on. JOHN Could you put the music back up for like 10 seconds so I can finish sucking this sweet.

Right and throat closing. digested or in the throes of digestion. Mad old farmer frack was vexed. Not on account of his cows as would normally be the cause of his vexation for his cows were unusually contented in their field trimming and munching in balmy weather, contented perhaps because they were not being driven relentlessly from field to field, through gate after gate by the Mad old farmer for no apparent purpose, as was his habit come rain or shine, though rain was much more common than shine in that part of the world where old farmer frat had his farm, E I E, I O. For once the cows were being left to go about their cow, a business undisturbed, for old farmer frac had other things on his mad old mind, things that kept him from attending to his cows. And that was vexing him on this Mary Mae morning. And what was vexing him on this Mary my morning was seething envy, envy of his neighboring farmers, whose names we know not but whose farms gloried in the scarecrows, fantastic constructions of sticks and straw and hay and old rags and abandoned hats and Have you serried ranks of them scattered here and there across the field? frightening any crows that might ponder landing for a peck of a growing crop? frightening children to those traipsing across the field to or from the village school or post office? Who could imagine the scarecrows springing to life uttering rustic curses and abracadabra is causing birds to topple dead from the sky, and trees to wither and die or such mystery as to amuse them to Reek out there in the country where civilization is held at bay, and weird and wild spirits are abroad in the land more long, weirder nor wild, some say, than the innards of Mad old farmer fracks head, the like of which is the stuff of nightmares to city folk, the innards of that head atop the creaking frame that is leaning on one of his farm fences. This may morning, his mad eyes dreaming as he surveys the neighbor's field, and then numberless scarecrows, the cause of his vexations, for he has not a single scarecrow in his field, having been banned from keeping them by the rustic authorities, on trumped up charges, gossip put about by the other farmers, terrible tales of cruelty and vise about which he was given no opportunity to defend himself. Before the ruling was laid down at a conclave, in a barn on a thunder booming evening. And ever since he is seen his fields beset by impertinent crows, and afraid to swoop and this is this that vexes him on every day God brings until he is at his wits end, leaning on the fence, boots embedded in a puzzle, gazing scarecrows, which all of a sudden, within the weird and wild in a dip his head, there is a spark a snap, and he has a bright idea is many years long years since Matt alfama. frac provided a service to the woman he knew only as posty, the woman who presided over the village post office. In his befuddled old head, he cannot recall exactly what it was he did for her. If he concentrates hard, he recalled something about her asking him for a hen to be excuse me, something about a hen to be ritually sacrificed. Its end trails scattered on the post office floor and the signs read. She seemed well satisfied with the signs whatever they work, for. They foretold that one day in the future, she would leave the village post office behind and be known as international a woman of mystery Primrose dent.

And so it came to pass, and alfama fracks Bill had scratched on the wall of his bomb, metal Tapping Machine number. She gave it to him, she said in case he ever needed to call in a favor. He had given her hand the necessary time, she could not promise him a hand in return. And in any case, that would be foolish. A farmer in need of a new hand would not obtain one from an international woman of mystery, would he? But if he had a request commensurate with her power, and status and fantastic mystery, he should not hesitate to contact her alfama frac thumps his forehead repeatedly on a fence post in or at his own stupidity. Why did he not think of calling her before he turns his back on his neighbor's scarecrows and trudges off to the barn? Is that international woman of mystery? Primrose dent? Speaking? This is old farmer frac. Ah, my sacrificial hen provider after all these years, how are you? I am sorely vexed. tisk tisk and you were calling in a favor and asking me to undo your vexation. That's about the size of it. Yes. How may I help you mad old farmer you I want to talk to you about robots.

The Merry month of May has come and gone. It is now September. Throughout the summer months, there was much hammering and pounding and sawing and banging and grinding and creaking in the sinister subterranean headquarters. Somewhere underneath the Alps were international woman of mystery Primrose dent holds sway. At the end of August, a fleet of container lorries set out along the winding mountain roads, ferrying their cargo to mad old farmer frack. Now, I see whites have a morning and comes out to bellow his cows. He gazes up at the sky and sees crows masses of them, or too fearful to come swooping down upon his field. Yet there is still not a scarecrow to be seen anywhere on his farm. Instead, far more terrifying to crows than his neighbor's constructions of sticks and straw and hay and old rags and abandoned hats and what have you. plodding across mad old farmer frack field? A thousands upon thousands of robots, big and clunky and clanking and clunking and magnetic lights flashing and buzzers buzzing, pitiless automatons, whose computerized brains are programmed with the single instruction exterminate crows.

Let us conduct an experiment. I would like you to make a mental note. Sorry. Start again. Let us conduct an experiment. I would like you to make a mental list of say three or four of the most awful things you can possibly imagine. Do not stint do not shy away from the power of your mind to summon Horus. For our purposes, your mental flights should be vivid enough for you to feel physically in your innards, terror or disgust or nausea or panic or whatever else is appropriate to the hideous visions swirling before you.

Frank Key  13:01
Done. Now, I will show you how I can offer

Frank Key  13:10
excuse me done. Now, I will show you how I can offer sucker and solace and wipe away your terror or disgust or nausea or panic in an instant. All I need to say is worse things happen. See, see. Once however often your imaginings you are comforted by the thought that they could be much much worse, because worse things happen. See, this must be true, for it is a saw or saying it has gained currency by containing at least a grain of truth. This is how a phrase becomes a saying people repeat it because they recognize a deep truth within it. oft repeated, it becomes common familiar to all so no one. So nobody would repeat the phrase worse things happen at see if it were not true. If however awful a thing what one might imagine. Yet something even more awful would happen at sea. We can easily demonstrate this by comparing it with a different combination of words. A phrase that has never been repeated, has not become a source or a saying all goats cause mayhem for instance. It simply said a doddle to memorize and then its syntactic structure identical to many a well known saying we can imagine it in the mouth of a countryside character speaking in a generic BBC peasant accent. Yes, it is not said because it's not true. Some goats called my hand in particular circumstances, but many more goats do not. So, all goats cause mayhem is not a saying. worse things happen as see is. There is one flaw in the design of my experiment. In summoning to mind three or four of the most awful things you could possibly imagine. one or more of them might have been maritime, or shipwreck, for example, or a boy stood on a burning deck, or the emergence from the depths of the many tentacles gigantic slime covered the monster known as the krakken. In these cases, for me to say, worse things happen at sea would offer no sucker nor solace whatsoever. I am in my terrible imaginings already is see you clot you would cry, and justifiably so. Next time I conduct the experiment, I will rephrase the promise. I would like you to make a mental list of say, three or four of the most awful things you can possibly imagine happening on land. Though the more astute among the class might guess where I'm going with that one. There is a pleasing universal tality to the idea that whatever horror you may imagine, or if you are unlucky actually experience you can take solace from the fact that worse things happen at sea. By University by universality, I mean that is true in all cases. This will not surprise us. When we consider how mind numbingly vast The sea is.

Frank Key  16:51
It covers seven tenths of our pretty globe. We speak sometimes of the seven seas, but in truth there is only one vast as I have said, and salty and wet. Here and there dropping jutting out from it are landmasses big and small from continent to ayaats. But they're insignificant in comparison to the sea. It is only to be expected that worse things than you can possibly imagine occur in the vast salty wet briny deep. The last time I conducted this experiment was to have a class of tots. So the last time I conducted this experiment was to a class of taught at a community self esteem and diversity awareness hub, to which I had been invited to distribute prizes. before handing out the Googles. I have the top give vent to their wildest and most horrible imaginings. hysteria ensued, and a paramedic from a nearby clinic had to be rushed to the hole to inject the more frantic tinies this annoyed me as I had hoped to bring a sense of calm and the peace that passeth all understanding simply by telling them that worse things happen. See, unfortunately, before I have the chance to do so, one precocious Todd shot his hand up begging to say something. Yes, yes. What is it? I shouted in the exasperated voice i'd tend to assume with precocious talks. One of the three or four or four things I have been imagining in my mind's eye is the grumpy man. I don't care what you say he is equally if not more terrifying than the krakken nonsense I wrapped back. Back crackers are many tentacle than gigantic and slime covered a monster which comes oozing up from the briny deep, and lays waste anything it can lash out at with it many tentacles and it is so huge. It can swallow great container ships hold. Get I know, said the infuriating Todd. But the grumpy man is huge and horrible and hairy and comes forth from his cave or lair and lays waste everything in his path. And his roaring is so loud that both for dead from the sky. Yes, said a second talk without putting his hand up. And what about the lumbering walrus mustache psychopathic serial killer bubinski I have been imagining him as one of my three or four or four things and I am so petrified that I have peddled in my pants and I am known as the bravest. most courageous talk in the community self esteem and diversity awareness hub and I am typing I am captain of everything and winner of the Mrs. joyful prize for raffia work. Now look here, I snapped. But such was the hubbub, the screaming, the hysterics, the gnashing of teeth, the rending of garments, the pedaling and the pants, that I was drowned out. worse things happen at sea. I bellowed and heard. And for the very first time, I wondered if the saw or saying really was true. The scene before me was more awful than anything else I have ever experienced. And we were far inland very far indeed, from the vast wet, salty sea.

There will be jam tomorrow. The announcement was made on the front page of the tinderbox. I was absolutely sure in my own head that we had been promised jam today, but I can only conclude that I was wrong. Perhaps this is the first flickering sign of a descent into madness. The announcement signed by the regional captain of the new peasant army is unequivocal. There will be jam tomorrow, he says, and he goes on to give the locations of kiosks where we can form an orderly queue to exchange our coupons for jam. Several different flavors are promised including raspberry and strawberry and quince. Mama made we'll have to wait for another day. Isn't that a wise the way I decided to recognize the sight of my nearest kiosk on the corner of the square. Shortly after dawn, the square was empty, safer bird packing, aughts and scantlings. There was no sign of a kiosk of any description. I kept all four corners, even though the announcement in the tinderbox was clear that it was the northwest corner, where stands the big stone statue of Charles Hawtrey, miraculously undefiled by the roving goon squads of the new peasant army. The sculptor admitted the eyes, choosing to have two blank stone discs for the lenses of Hawk trees, specs. That grant him a weird blind authority, and I think it might be this that deters the thugs. After all, they lost no time in smashing to smithereens the statue of Eric Sykes in another square in another part of town. That there was no kiosk did not of course mean there would not be one. That would not be one on that very spot tomorrow. It takes no time at all to put up a kiosk and to pocket with jars of jam. It is likely that the erection of the kiosk will take place in the small hours of the night, when all good citizens are tucked in their beds, and the windows shuttered and their radios silenced. Then dawn when the Hooters Blaze, or shortly thereafter. Then dawn when the Hooters Blair, or shortly thereafter, we can make our way to the square and form an orderly queue. Those of us who have the necessary coupons.

Frank Key  24:04
I am fortunate to have coupons for DRAM and coupons for mama made. For safety. I keep them in a concealed cubby locked with several different padlocks, the keys of which I keep on a string tied around my left leg just above the knee. I have a tail. I have a tail at the ready in case I am patted down by one of the patrols. It is not that my coupons are forgeries, and I have every right to them. But in the present climate, they're like gold dust, especially the marmalade coupons. I was there when they smashed up the Eric Sykes statue. I just happened to be passing and thought it prudent to stop and clap. The records were a gaggle of new recruits, the newest of the new peasants in the new peasant army. I have turned the phrase over and over in my mind, this idea of the new peasant. How does it differ from an old peasant except in his fanaticism? Not that one sees many or any old peasants nowadays, Where have they gone? When made finished smashing the statue of Eric Sykes, I watched them depart on their way to a rally by past close by me so close I could have touched them. And I was sure I saw on them the stashes smears of jam, but how could that be? There was no jam that day, nor the next, nor indeed will there be any jam until tomorrow. So I must have been suffering from a hallucination another side of incipient madness. I have learned to cope with gamblers picnics. At first it was hard, so hard to pack the hamper and to realize that yes, one had done one was done packing. That was it. There was no jar of jam to cram in at the last minute. out then heaving the hamper all along remain towards the greasy, grassy splendor of happy Jake's Memorial Field. Still were still with jam pains. For the first few picnics at least plopping the hamper on the grass, I would find myself somehow expecting a jar of jam to appear miraculously. When I lifted the lid. It took several picnics for that hope to die in me. But die It did. And now it has been revived. As I said, I thought there was going to be jam today. I'm sure that was what was announced in yesterday's tinderbox. In my mind's eye, I can still see it. big, bold black block capitals, accompanied by a cutout and keep mezzotint of the regional captain is face grim yet puckish his specs glinting, his moustache fabulous with that, merely another hallucination I would be tempted to go to the clinic, but the clinic has been burned to the ground by a gang of old peasants. The gang was still at large, and we were warned to be on our guard. In a further depredation. I had stolen a consignment of jam destined for our kiosks. at a rally, I bought my undying hatred of them along with everyone else. But truthfully, there was no real hatred in my heart label. Welcome to the jam as far as I was concerned. By then, I had grown so used to my jammies picnics, that I could barely imagine a picnic with jam. But then came the announcement in the tinderbox, not every day, but often enough to raise my hopes to have me salivating. Once more it became a trial to pack the hamper. Once more my mind played tricks as I headed along the line towards the field. The stone statue of Hattie Jake's gazed kindly upon me as I queued my dry hunks of bread and slurped my brackish water, as if she too was saying, back up, back up, for there will be jam tomorrow.

That's the end of this week's show. I hope you enjoyed it. Sound a clacs on shortly to wake everyone up. Those of you who dropped off while listening to those three stories.

Frank Key  28:50
Excuse me? Do go and visit hooting yard.org, the website of the radio show there's much much much much to read, including three brand new stories written over the last few days. Tales of don't plow. Don't plow is a town in a northern part of the world on a railway mine, and I've been right I've been running stories about it even though I've never visited it might be one day I will. As I say that's the end of the show. I hope you've enjoyed it. Thanks to Johnny seven for his expertise behind the knobs or sliders or whatever they called. And yeah, wake up now. cracks on sound inserted here and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
