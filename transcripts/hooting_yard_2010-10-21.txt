Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. And this is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for a while. Never let it be said that hooting er doesn't follow a kind of very clever pattern because if you recall last week, the show ended if you were listening, the show ended with a couple of quotations from a 1934 book by Elliot O'Donnell called strange cults and secret societies of modern London. And the second of those two quotes concerned, spooky goings on at a tree growing at a crossroads, not far from South mins What is it or was it about South Mimms? because later on in the same book, we find this. On All Hallows, Ian, certain members of the ghost circle were invited to meet at 11 at night in secrecy at crossroads not far from South mins all turned up the founder as usual arriving first and on the neighboring clock striking midnight, they were surprised to see a herd of pigs trotting down the road towards them, road and pigs gleaming white in the moonbeams. never had any of the members of the ghost circle seen such pigs. They seemed to be positively gigantic, but thin. On they came perfectly noiselessly. And on arriving at the crossroads, they passed through a gateway into a field leaving in their wake a current of icy air. There was something so strange and eerie about them that several members of the ghost circle overcoming a certain reluctance, ran to the gate to have another look at them. The field which afforded no cover of any kind, was very large, and it was empty save for cattle, the pigs had inexplicably vanished. The members of the circle learned subsequently that the cross roads were known to be haunted by our herd of Phantom pigs, but only on All Hallows, Ian. And so I think, bearing that in mind, I think at the end of this month, the hooting yard Phantom pigs spotting club should convene at that Crossroads not far from South Mims Be there or be square has the heck cats used to say half a century ago. Daddy Oh.

I feel not yet a member of the hooting yard Phantom pigs spotting club. please do join we need to do is go to the hooting yard website and make a donation and then you'll become an official member. If you're listening to this on the podcast and it's long after Halloween 2010 you can still make still make a donation it would be nice. It's very nice when I get donations because we don't get paid here a resonance and we all live in abject poverty. Anyway, here's a story called The despicable noodles. These noodles are despicable. shouted the priest. He was glaring at the bowl set before him his eyes glistening like globs of molten fire, or rather his eye for he had just the one he had plucked out its twin years ago in an act of penitence for sins as despicable as his noodles. They are the last noodles in the monastery pantry father, said the monk. I am a Monsignor shouted the priest and you will address me as your magnificence. He was a very shouty Monsignor, forgive me Monsignor, but I do not think that's the correct form of address field. stationed within the hierarchy of the church, said the monk. Definitely he placed a pair of chopsticks next to the bowl. Now, eat up before your noodles go cold. The Monsignor was I burned with even greater ferocity, and he banged his fist upon the table. He had only the one fist for the arm to which its twin had once formed. The extremity had been ripped from its socket years ago in an agricultural mishap. Cold and despicable noodles he shouted, Is this how you welcome my magnificence to your shabby Abbey. This is a monastery rather than an abbey Monsignor replied the monk tucking a bib of golden cloth under his superiors chin. And though the shabbiness of its fabric is unarguable, our souls are pure, or at least as pure as constant and hysterical prayer can make them the Monsignor sweat the bowl aside with his one forearm and it clattered to the floor strewing the noodles or Kim can. The bowl did not break for it was made of tin. Bring me better noodles, he shouted and serve them in a ceramic bowl. I'm afraid I cannot exceed your request, said the monk. For as I have explained these noodles with the last in the pantry, and our stocks are now exhausted. As for the bowl, it has perhaps escaped your Monsignor, you'll notice that we are a teeny monastery and quite quite populous. As he spoke, the monk used a broom to sweep the strew noodles back into the bowl, which he replaced in front of the Monsignor. There he said or queued, no harm done, tuck in. The monk was going to add a jaunty remark about mishaps in a monastery refectory being far less traumatic than agricultural mishaps, comparing the circumstances and ramifications of both, but before he could do so, the Monsignor started shouting again. What filth has been commingled with these noodles as he swept them back into the bowl from your refectory floor? he roared with such Titanic rage that his whole body trembled, and the babe of golden cloth came loose. The monk gently tucked it back into place. I grant there is filth on our floor Msgr, but rest assured it is mild filth, the odd pocket of dust and perhaps a few million harmless bacteria, who knows? They may add a certain piquancy to your noodles. The Monsignor was countenance already florid, now took on the tint we imagined a painter might use to depict the fires of hell. These noodles were the spectable when first you set them before me, he shouted, and now they are doubly despicable. You have the goal to make my magnificence feed on Dustin bacteria as well.

Mon Senor said the monk, his patients almost inhuman. There are paupers in the hovels surrounding our monastery who would happily lick that tin bowl clean. Might I suggest you take off all those bright Bejeweled rings on your fingers, the better to manipulate the chopsticks. Speak to me not have paupers boomed them on Senor. I swept past their hobble the stride my horse on my way here. Had I still a second arm? I would have used it to cut them down with a mighty Monsignor Orioles sword. all well and good. If it pleases you said the monk. But slaughtering porpoise even in thought only is hungry work, as many are barren and brigand can attest. So you really ought to gobble up those noodles while they're lukewarm. Where all the other monks shouted the Monsignor, changing the subject suddenly to distract attention from the fact that now he began sliding the bright Bejeweled rings off his fingers using his teeth prepatory to picking up the chopsticks and eating the contents of his tin bowl. His hunger had to defeated his pride. Don't you worry your little head about the other monks, said the monk. It was his first error in this battle of wits to force the bowl of noodles and dust and bacteria down the Monsignor was gob. If there was one thing the Monsignor was sensitive about To the point of psychosis, it was the size of his head once it had been of average adult human head dimension, but following a missionary among jungle tribesmen mishap years ago, it had been shrunk to the size of a potato, a bigger than average potato, but a potato nevertheless. Once again sending the bowl clattering across the floor with a sweep of his forearm. The Monsignor rose from his stall, and clumped out of the refractory on his crutches, shouting incoherent imprecations as he went outside in the rain is to Burke yellow, yet elegant course was waiting. He mounted it, slotted his crutches into the panniers and high hideaway towards a different monastery surrounded by different toggles where he hoped to be fed, less despicable noodles. In his tantrum, he had forgotten to retrieve his bright good jewel rings. The monk gathered them from the table, and later that day, when it had ceased to rain, he squelched out into the market and distributed them among the porpoise first, insisting that they kneel down and pray constantly, hysterically, and it's so high a picture frenzy, that miles away, sitting down to a supper of pickable noodles in the refractory of a nunnery, the Monsignor thought he could hear the shrieking of the Damned. It was a den that delighted him. As he swallowed the last noodle from his ceramic bowl. He grinned, a grin somehow wider than his tiny head allowed, and so terrifying that the nun who served him his noodles swooned.

two verses now, or at least things that Ryan and I both were the musical theme. Here's the first one. crooner bonk crispy went widdershins round the Kirk. Three times he did it in fog, Mr. Murch. He had not read his Mr. James also his weeping widow claims he vanished off the earth and has no tumor. I hear his golden crooning in my living room, issues from the walls all day and all night, crooning, pleading for his widow's mite. And here is the second one. Dave Dee dozy beaky, Mick and tick one night in the word encountered a week. She was a bricklaying witch, and she carried a hold. She asked, which of you is blinking, which winking, which nod? beaky replied on behalf of the five that trio is fictional, but we are alive. They were invented for verse by Eugene field. With these words, the five Sims fate was sealed. The Witches countenance became twisted with hate, and she cried I'm Eugene fields childhood sweetheart captivity Wait, he abandoned me occur the dog yet My name is immortalized in his auto biog love affairs have a biblio maniac and then maddened she started to whack Dave Dee, dozy and Binky, and make and tick with brick after brick after brick until in the wood in the dead of the night, the soul of each popstar took heaven wood flight, their mortal lives gone. They sat next to God dispatched by the bricklaying, which with her hoard

wash waspish playwright Maude wasp had a glint in her eye. So she made an appointment With a top glint test to have it analyzed gaze at my panel and I'll take a look at your glint said the glint test. The panel was a rectangle of hardboard affixed to the wall with many many tax upon it had been drawn with a thick black marker pen and AB screws pattern of dots and zigzags and signals and letters from a possibly mystic alphabet. mod wasp gazed at it as bitten. As a playwright, she was alert to the sonic characteristics of the human voice, and he had noted that the glint has spoken a croaking and guttural manner, scarcely louder than a whisper. Assuming I may speak while I gaze without interfering with your analysis, may I ask if there is something amiss with your wind pipe? she asked. The Glenn test who was pairing up mod wasps, right, I threw his patent Glencoe scope, replied, You are not the first person to ask me that. I do indeed have an anomalous windpipe with the result that my voice sounds as if it's issuing from long ago and far away. Yes, said mod wasp. It's almost as if I'm being addressed by some Sonic being from the primordial sludge. The glint just snapped his glint. otoscope shots shot and slid it back into its velveteen Pichet, which in turn, he popped into a pocket of his bomber jacket. I have examined the glint in your eye, with sufficient rigor to write my report, he said, you may cease gazing at the panel. That was quick said mod wasp, who had been expecting a lengthier procedure. One of the reasons I am a top glint test Miss wasp is the startling rapidity with which I work. He said. There was the merest hint in his croaking that he felt in Pune, a hint picked up by the alert playwright. I did not mean to impugn you, she said, in fact, I'm delighted that I can avert my gaze so soon from that confounded panel of yours. The pattern was beginning to play havoc with my brain pans. It is rather disturbing, said the glint test, I copied it for a plate in a book almost as ancient as my voice. A tome kept under lock and key in a forbidden library, reputed to be the work of the Mad Arab Abdul hour has read. I thought I'd seen it somewhere before said mod wasp. I consulted that very book when writing the fourth of my so called pond plays. You remember, you may remember the deus ex machina at the end, where a milk of magnesia man is loaded onto the stage by a pulley. I'm afraid I have never seen any of your plays, said the glint test. My work keeps me fantastically busy. And on the rare occasions, I might be free to make a trip to the theater. I often have to go to a kiosk on a seaside Pier, where a charlatan healer makes enigmatic passing movements of his hands over my anomalous windpipe. You have to ask the playwright somewhat was specially indeed so said the glint test. At a mod wasps surprise she saw tears welling up in his eyes. I cannot very well neglect to meet the demands of my sainted mother's last will and testament. What a foul legacy, cried mod wasp. I am not so sure your mother was a saint. This is true to her. I am a top glint test Miss wasp said the glint test. If you only knew the sacrifices she made for me. Scrubbing doorsteps, a darling military flags and boiling soap and engaging in hand to hand combat with communists and sewing buttons onto orphans cardigans. Is croaking whisper trailed off, as salt tears gushed and rolled down his cheeks. There there, said the playwright, I did not mean to upset you, though I cannot help but observe if you continue to weep such copious tears, you could collect them in that dent in your floor to form a sort of indoor pond. Why in the name of heaven would I wish to do that croaked the glint test.

I am fond of Pons said mod wasp, and many of my plays more than you can imagine. A second or next to Pons. She grinned in a weird and waspish grin, which disconcerted the glint test. I'm so glad that I had the foresight to tuck into a pocket with my bomber jacket, a handy pocket sized tape recorder to preserve our conversation on magnetic tape. When I get home, I will transcribe it and use it as the climactic scene in the play I am currently writing as our conversation been sufficiently dramatic as the glint just trust me said mod wasp. I have an innate sense of the kind of dialogue by audiences will lap up and gasp that actually spoke the glint in her eye glinted the more brilliantly. Now we know why you haven't glint in your eye said the glint test demonstrating the expertise that made him know miracles gleam test, put a top clean test.

I realize I should have been a bit more consistent about the croaking whisper of the glint is there but apart from the fact that if it had been a grope, croaking whisper you may not have heard it. Audio or auditory verisimilitude is not necessarily the strong point of hooting yard. Anyway. Where is the Emperor in his bath, verily his top overflow with water scented with burger mocked and petunias and lilac cascaded over the side and has formed puddles and streams upon the Imperial bathroom floor tiles. flunkies with mops mop to no avail for the epra splashes about like a hippopotamus in a swamp, and he will not allow the taps to be turned off. Water gushes from them water already scented in its tank above under the eaves of the Imperial Palace roof. The Emperor is playing with his ducks. The Imperial ducks are not yellow plastic ones as might be found in a common as or a porpoise bath. But real, living, breathing, cracking, beaked and big feathered ducks, such as might be mesmerized by Gerard Manley Hopkins or Orson Welles were either of those noteworthy he's alive to see the Emperor in his bath. If Of course, they were allowed into His presence and that of his ducks. Each duck is tagged with the Imperial duck tag designed by the Emperor himself one day when he had nothing better to do and his empire was at peace. Is the Empire at peace still, no wars rage in almost every corner of the Empire and where wars do not rage, there are skirmishes. Some of the skirmish is a bloody around more gruesome than the wars, there is lopping of limbs and burning of bombs, Imperial military strategists huddled in groups fighting among themselves. Several of the most senior strategist expect a summons to attend the Emperor in his bath by have ordered a consignment of galoshes to ensure in the event of a summons, they're elegantly shaped leathan Imperial Army boots do not get wet stamping through the Imperial bathroom puddles and streams. Those as yet are mocked by mopping flunkies. The galoshes have not yet arrived at the imperial palace for such as the chaos wrought by wars and skirmishes that supply lines are unreliable. Train carriages sit abandoned in sidings, or a blown up by the bombs of insurgents and pathogens, and any number of raggle taggle enemies of the mighty Empire. What is the latest news? anti imperialist forces have taken parts of the Capitol and are encroaching upon the Imperial Palace itself. Some windows on the lower floors gorgeous windows of stained glass for which the Empire is famous has been shattered by insurgent rifle fire. Krishnan guru Murthy from Channel Four news has been helicoptered in to present live updates under trying conditions. His makeshift broadcast center was until last week, the home of the Imperial duck man who was forced to flee across the mountains. Before he fled, he ferried the ducks, one by one to a place of safety in the Imperial Palace. fanatically loyal to the last he scrubbed each and every duck tag clean of grease and spottings. If ever the Emperor sees the duck man again, he's going to award him a medal. Will the Emperor ever see his duck man again? That we cannot say events are moving so fast. Only a fool would predict what lies ahead in the next 10 minutes, let alone in the coming days and weeks and months. And now it seems a paradox what with all the splashing and splashing and cracking. The one still center of calm throughout the Empire is the Imperial bathtub for the Emperor has a glint in his eye, a glint that would announce to the mopping flunkies were they allowed to look upon the Imperial countenance and to the senior military strategist where they summon Didn't they galoshes to the Imperial presence, that the Emperor has a plan. What is the Imperial plan?

The glint in the Imperial AI has been studied by top grueling tests, and they report the blurred outline of a large and lovely house perched high in the Swiss Alps, the seat of a government in exile and within on an upper floor, but he's a tank brimming with water scented with burger Martin petunias and lilac and magnificently appointed bathroom. at its center, a tub in which ducks splash and quack and an emperor weeps for what was lost.

Frank Key  27:05
And that, dear listeners is the end of this week shooting out on the air. I hope you found it entertaining and instructive. I'll be back next week with more of pretty much the same bye bye
