Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air in a change to the advertised program or advertised in the sense that it was in the resonance listings on the website, and different stuff. Dobson adored Wednesday potato nights, it will be no exaggeration to say he was besotted with them. He would fairly skip along the toilet lines to the appointed field, where he would join his many many equally potato pastic pals as they hang on.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
I was always under the impression that Dobson was a solitary sought in a recluse, sitting alone in his disastrous escritor. We've only marigold Chu for company and she in a different room. This is the first I've heard of many, many powers.

Frank Key  01:13
Well, Dobson was indeed an immensely popular figure with friends of all shapes and sizes scattered in Bailey wicks near and far. what one has to remember is that most of the time he shunned them, but they were a forgiving lot in France, perhaps by the honor of being counted among the so called powers of the pamphleteer. And so at twilight on Wednesday, potato night, they gathered in a field a happy band,

Unknown Speaker  01:44
and this all seems a bit dubious to me. One minute Dobson is shunning his friend as we might expect of him, and now he's skipping along the lane with them, presumably with an idiot grin on his face and flowers in his hair.

Frank Key  01:56
Your presumptions are wrong whoever you are, a man even a pamphleteer can be happy without spotting an idiot grin, and flowers in the hair is your own invention. There's nothing to suggest Dobson adopted such a hippie head decoration. As for shuttling back and forth between the enchantment and the unfoldment of his powers, how could it be otherwise, if we regard Dobson as fully human, with all the flaws and in consistencies and non hippy headgear, choices of an every man now, gathering in the field armed with their potatoes and camping, gas, stoves and flasks of water, the enthusiasts watched the last glimmers of sunlight vanish below the horizon and ignited their torches of petrol soak rags tied to the end of sticks. over yonder sprites distorted themselves in the fog above the eerie mark. over yonder sprite distorted themselves in the

Unknown Speaker  03:02
Yes, I heard what you said, Surely a fog is something you get in a confined space like the fog of smoke in the saloon bar or the count pins in the days before the smoking ban. You wouldn't get a fog over a marsh however airy unless of course, these are cigar smoking sprites, you're talking about

Frank Key  03:18
pipe smoking sprites, actually. And because there's no wind on Wednesday, potato nights, not even the hint of a breeze. The air above the Erie marshes still and the smoke from the sprite pipes hangs there eerily in a fog, and Dobson, and all his many pals standing there field torches lit piering at the marsh fog, as if transfixed before setting about their potato business. They pour water from their flasks into pots, and they liked the camping guy.

Unknown Speaker  03:53
He didn't mention anything about pots before when you last listed what they brought with them potatoes and camping gas stoves and flasks, you said and in fact, you didn't say anything about torches or petrol soaked rags tied to the ends of steaks until they lit them. And you haven't explained what they lit them with matches Zippo lighters, I like detail and you are not providing it. Would it not be better at the outset to give us a comprehensive list of all the items these people were carrying along the Twilight lanes towards the fields on Wednesday, potato nights. You want a comprehensive list? That would be excellent. A catalog perhaps with a description of each item and a catalog number and price and an online shopping basket and checkout. So that if I wanted to be no perchance, you know I could you know for instance, use my hosting yard card to actually buy things. You have to add pictures as well of course and in color.

Frank Key  04:55
Well, that would take

Unknown Speaker  04:57
when and why you're about a subject into the catalogue inserted at the end with similar details of the match sprites pipes and pipe smoking paraphernalia. There are always various bits and bobs a pipe is needs to enjoy a proper pipe smoking experience, like pipe cleaners, for instance. And, and even though it was a supplement, you know, not the main part of the catalog per se, it would have a similar level of detail with photographs of all the pipe cleaners and so on. And as I stated before in color,

Frank Key  05:26
that's rather a lot of work.

Unknown Speaker  05:28
Yes, I grant you that, but has it not occurred to you that this kind of thing is what your readers are crying out for? Um, it's all very well blathering on about the pamphleteer and is supposedly unchained powers boiling potatoes and afield in the night. But what we want to actually be able to recreate is the scenes of comfort of your own community hub fenced off frolicking compounds, and we need the kits to to be able to do so think of the money you can make.

Frank Key  05:54
Well, I suppose the main catalog wouldn't be too much of a problem, time consuming and a bit finicky, but I could do it. Whereas the supplement will be much more difficult. Have you ever tried to take a photograph of a pipe sprite above an airy Marsh? I can't say that I have. I'd need a spirit camera. Ordinary cameras would be worse than useless. All you would see would be a gray blur.

Unknown Speaker  06:18
A blow do i'm not fussy? I can study the photographs using my theory, Erie Marsh sprach scope. Buy One Get One Free at humans. So in essence.

Frank Key  06:29
So in essence, all your interruptions have been leading up to a blatant advertisement for that confounded department store. That's despicable.

Unknown Speaker  06:38
Maybe so But as you know, humans is a byword for utter gorgeousness.

Frank Key  07:19
This is the goat God catechism and listen very carefully because really, you should learn this by heart, or at least know the answers. Following this recital, the goat God catechism Is there anything more frightening than the goat God? No, there is not. Must one tremble when the goat God appears looming from a cloud of foul inexplicable

Unknown Speaker  07:53
gas? Yes, one must tremble.

Frank Key  07:56
How must one tremble in all and dread? Must one cover ones is when one hears the terrible clattering of the goat God's God's cloven hooves upon the linoleum.

Unknown Speaker  08:09
Yes, one let's clap one's hands over one's ears.

Frank Key  08:14
When the goat God braise it harsh Bray, is it so loud that all birds and small mammals in the vicinity are rendered death?

Unknown Speaker  08:24
Yes, they are. deafened

Frank Key  08:26
temporarily, is mayhem caused by the deafening of birds and small mammals?

Unknown Speaker  08:32
Yes, it can be because those that depend on hearing for orientating themselves in a sky or upon the earth become confused and terrified.

Frank Key  08:42
Does the goat God take pleasure from causing such havoc in the natural world?

Unknown Speaker  08:47
Yes it does. There is mirth in his brain.

Frank Key  08:51
It's the go to God accompanied by help meet.

Unknown Speaker  08:55
Yes, the goat God has to help meet

Frank Key  08:58
are the goat Gods helped meet men or goats.

Unknown Speaker  09:02
They are mutant hybrids of both their upper half being as a man, their lower half being as a goat.

Frank Key  09:08
Do the helpmeet speak in a human tongue? Or do they Bray as would a goat?

Unknown Speaker  09:14
They do neither, for they are silent.

Frank Key  09:17
What horror takes place once the cloud of foul gases dispersed to reveal the goat God and it helped me in all where dreadful majesty.

Unknown Speaker  09:28
Some of the different birds fall from the sky and some of the small mammals scurry about in circles or disoriented. Best, your befuddlement?

Frank Key  09:37
What else happens?

Unknown Speaker  09:38
I continue to tremble in awe and dread with my hands clapped over my ears.

Frank Key  09:42
What does the goat God do?

Unknown Speaker  09:45
It continues to pray loud and merciful and terrifying.

Frank Key  09:48
Does it continue to clutter its cloven hooves upon the linoleum.

Unknown Speaker  09:53
Yes it does.

Frank Key  09:55
Why is the ground covered in linoleum

Unknown Speaker  09:58
because the goat got that appeared in its cloud of foul unexplicable gas in the kitchenette of my squalid flat.

Frank Key  10:05
For what purpose has the goat God appeared in your flat?

Unknown Speaker  10:10
I'm not yet sure of its purpose, but it appears it appears because I accidentally summoned it.

Frank Key  10:16
By what accident Did you summon the goat God and it helped me

Unknown Speaker  10:20
the accidents was that I was. The accident was that I was reading aloud a recipe from old Mr. purgatives wonder book of pies and I pronounce some of the words and miss.

Frank Key  10:32
Wait a moment. If you're in your flat, what explains the presence of always deafened birds and small mammals?

Unknown Speaker  10:41
I said, my flat as a scholar is flat. It has no roof and it's overrun with wildlife.

Frank Key  10:46
Why do you have no roof over your head?

Unknown Speaker  10:48
My roof was removed by the regime.

Frank Key  10:51
Do you think old Maher purgative deliberately inserted words which might easily be pronounced amiss into her pie recipes to trick her readers into summoning the goat God?

Unknown Speaker  11:03
Yes, I do.

Frank Key  11:05
Gosh,

Unknown Speaker  11:05
indeed.

Frank Key  11:07
What happens next?

Unknown Speaker  11:08
I'm going to finish baking the pie and feed it to the goat God and it's helped me it's and then which will issue for for my flat and wreak revenge. I'm sorry, revenge and vengeance upon the regime. Will you be writing up an account of the terror you unleash? No, for this whole baileywick shall be laid waste and there will be neither note paper nor pens or pencils when they are done. When we are done. In fact,

Frank Key  11:30
will your flats there'll be standing

Unknown Speaker  11:32
No, it will not and I shall vanish with the goat God and it's helped me to in a second cloud of foul, inexplicable gas.

Frank Key  11:39
Will the regime survive the vengeance you and the goat garden it's helped me Reek

over Gourmet, which is a website as a splendidly named and obviously Uber trendy. Adam Brent hootersling possibly huff Tallinn. That's HOUGHT a l i n g. Anyway, splendidly named, obviously Uber trendy, and he's had the bright idea of applying Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies in the kitchen. Here at hooting yard of course, we don't need the assistance of the man we know as Brian one anagram to inspire our cutlery bagatelles here's the latest recipe from occasional contributor Fatima Gilly Blatt. Fatima can't be here with us to read it herself. So I'm reading it for her. Boiled or broiled conga ale with sandwich paste and Brazil nuts. Take one fully grown adult conga eel of handsome paths. Rinse it thoroughly in freezing cold water. Then dab it dry with a large rectangular beach towel. Fill an eel shaped pan with water placed on the hub hub hub and bring to the boil or broil. plunge the Congo eel into the seizing liquid in one easy, elegant, yet startling movement. Add a dash of ground pepper. Leave to simmer for 45 minutes. Transfer the boiled or broiled conga eel onto a platter. Open a medium sized jar of sandwich paste and spoon the entire contents glommed onto the eel. Use a butter knife to spread the paste so it coats pretty much the whole top side. place under the grill and toast for 10 minutes or until the color of turbinado sugar. Toss a few Brazil nuts onto the platter and serve best eaten with bare hands tearing the Congo ill to shreds in the sort of frenzy while listening to the Mr. Luba on your hi fi

they must have been putting something in Fatima Gilly blatz cornflakes. We don't hear from her for many imune but now hard on the heels of her latest recipe. I've also had this threat Letter from her pencil miss the key. This is the form of greeting Fatima always uses for reasons lost in the fog of Duda. finding myself at a loose end and unnerved by inexplicable clunks. I thought it would be a good idea to bury myself in research. As you know, I've long been fascinated by mystic foods devoured by mystic beings. So I trotted off to the library, sorry, chat and snack zone to consult some reference works. I was wondering what if anything, was the connection between the manor sent down from heaven for the Israelites in the books of Exodus and numbers, and Ambrosia as munched by the gods of Greek mythology. It also occurred to me that there may be a link to the mess of pottage for which Esau sells his birthright in Genesis. Yes, yes, I know most authorities would have it that he saw his mess with some kind of lentil stew. But I've never been I've never been afraid to fly in the face of accepted wisdom, nor indeed to foul sacred cows with my girly fists. I learned a thing or two from the matchless deeds of tiny Enid you know? Having silence the chattering snacking mobile phone Wittering teenage hoi polloi with a thunderbolt. I spent some happy hours poring over mystic texts. Pour, pour, pour. That was me, brows furrowed in concentration, scribbling notes in my recipe ideas notebook. You will be pleased to hear that the result of my studies is a brand new Fatima gala black recipe for what I was going to call the guru of the gods. Until it struck me that violent mano theists might take the usual umbrage, and I could end up being cast into the outer darkness or beheaded. So I settled on God go. For the time being, I've decided to keep it a secret formula like Coca Cola, although I hasten to add that God glue has nothing whatsoever in common with that tooth, rotting fizzy pop. My current plan is to unveil his wondrous guru in a 10 part television series called Fatima gala Blatt spiritually uplifting guru kitchen paradise. Keep an eye on the sheduled

last week, I read the opening chapter of Victorian Victorian Penny Dreadful called palyed ada, the crippled heiress and his chapter 49. Countless fathoms deep, far far below the roiling ocean waves upon which our battered leaking ship is pitched and tossed down down in the black depths at the very seabed, in a crevice of a rock encrusted with a billion years of salty in crust mint. What wonders would we see lit by the glow of fat eerie beings that pulsate and drift in the undersea world? directly below our ship, far, far below, nestled in the crevasse there is a man dressed in garb, half tattered black cloth, half trailing weed, he is breathing freely from his perfume bottle Atomizer Air bulb invention. around him a gathered ranks of aquatic beings, the thin and the tendrils, the suckered and the eyeless, the trans loosened and those that are mere blobs. They are wrapped for with gloves and goggles. The man is preaching to them the word of the Lord. The man is none other than Alonzo Plunkett, the kindly krisztian gentlemen, we last saw being dragged into the sea from a deserted stretch of British beach in the lobster like claws of a sea monster. It is with the aid of compass and sextant and stout hearted prayer that we have dropped anchor at the very spot in the vastness of the oceans below which the semi Sibelius benefactor of pallid ADA, the crippled Eris is converting the denizens of the deep. Following his briny abduction, a committee of seaside worthies raised funds for a voyage to go in search of Plunkett. No better Captain could we have them the terrifying and God fearing retired Admiral pips crew poring over his charts sucking on his pipe, besieging the Lord. Our captain has steered us his and scissor for six long years, following the most fleeting of clues. Until now the prize is in our grasp. orcs and guillemots will madly in the sky above our ship as out on deck crew men totteridge. And whetstone laboriously in garb themselves in the very best shiny brass Victorian diving gear. The captain stands to one side is highly polished pegleg glistening in the sunlight. Having at the last affixed to their helmets, unfeasibly extensive length of pneumatic rubber tubing, the crew men topple over the side, but not before Admiral pips through booms after him, and we all join in. And then, first totteridge then whetstone, a gone vanished below the waves. We can but wait for their return, Alonzo Plunkett safe and sound in the next they carry between them. Excuse me. Sound Did I say. However, kindly However, krisztian however expert in the geological treasures of the British coastline, how sound can a man be after spending six years in the blackest deep? His only company the weird aquatic life forms that God having made at once condemned to remain submerged in the depths of the blue tumultuous waters, from poop to all up as we wait. There are mutterings that Plunkett restored to the world of men will be a twitching and shattered globe globbing wreck drooling Brian is once fine Buffon shockingly tangled with weed and sea scum, the tension mounts and we busy ourselves with abstract nautical activities, as our captain broods on the bridge, absent mindedly prising barnacles off a straight timber plank. Night falls. Night falls. Night at sea is very different tonight on land, better writers that I am measurably better have evoked the arresting aura

Frank Key  23:03
of the sea night. So much greater Are they the very air around them is rarefied and pure and I am not fit to breathe an atom of it. If ever I were to meet such a writer, which I would not, but if say I was mistakenly invited to a Swiss cocktail party at which one was present, I would expect to be squashed beneath their boot like a might. I am but a humble jack tar, eking my story living in the rigging, scribbling prose in my two few idle moments, smudging the brine the soaked pages as I sweep from the crumbs of the hard tack biscuits that fall from my carried gob. dawn breaks and still there is no sign of totteridge and whetstone donut see offers a very different prospect to dawn on land. There are great painters whose canvases will show you why my own dogs done with the dregs from tins of shipping motion will not our only means of communication with the two crewman gone below to rescue Alonzo Plunkett is a coded system of tags to the ropes to which they are attached. It had been thought prudent not to extend the complexity of the system by adding a series of secondary tugs to their pneumatic rubber tubing, as a single misjudged tug might disrupt their air supply and consign them to a watery death. Admiral pips crew who has not slept is ready to command one toggle on the ropes to signal as previously arranged, is almighty god keeping you safe from harm in the emergency To his fathomless oceans, but he stays his hand when an eagle eyed cabin boy pipes up to announce that both Tata ridges and wet stones ropes are being tugged from below. And as we look, indeed, they are not merely tugged but yanked pulled with main force, so threatening to topple the mask to which they are lashed. And that mask is the main mast. So as it topples, the ship itself will keel over. We are in mortal danger. Whatever is tugging those ropes has inhuman strength. Our captain has to decide whether the sacrifice to have his crew for the good of all. But a night without sleep has scattered his wits, and he delays too long. With a last mighty heave. The ship is overturned, and every man jack of us is tossed into the sea.

Frank Key  26:06
Our descent to the depths is calm and dreamlike. There is no panic. No thrashing about no bobbing to the surface for a last hopeless gulp of air before plunging again. We sink every one of us slowly and peacefully until we land with scarcer bump on the seabed. And they're before us in translucent shimmers. We see Alonzo Plunkett and totteridge and whetstone, and any number of fantastic marine life forms greeting us with glob glob glob hosannas in the undersea paradise built with his bare hands by the kindly Christian gentleman during six years of hard subaquatic toil to the glory of God.

Frank Key  27:28
Well, wasn't that exciting. That's the end of this week, hooting out on the air before I go, I must thank very much trembling Blakeney for taking the vocal the additional vocal parts in the goat God catechism and the exciting story of Dobson's Wednesday potato night and trembling blatantly blatantly rushed in to do that, having not even seen the text before. So I think we should all be very grateful to him for a great piece of work. I'll be back next week, probably by myself. And until then, bye bye.
