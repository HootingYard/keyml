Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And it's the very last hooting yard show this year. Although the last live hooting out this year, there will be a Christmas special last year I had it we did a Christmas special was a three hour reading of Drew bellatti agno by Christopher smart. I'm not going to tell you what this year's Christmas special is I'm recording it tomorrow, and it will be broadcast at some point in the Christmas and New Year fortnight. So look out for the lookout for when it's on the resonance website. Onwards with today's show, there was once a woodcutter, who had a burning sense of injustice. he dwelt in a cottage deep in the forest, where there was plenty of wood for him to cut. a day's walk to the West was the cottage of a charcoal burner, and a day's walk to the east was the hovel of a drink soaked ex Trotskyist popinjay. These were the wood cutters neighbors, and they worried about his burning sense of injustice, and sort what they could do to alleviate it. But the wood cutter was a very taciturn wood cutter, and he never answered either the charcoal burner or the poppin. J. When they asked him to explain, as I did on Thursdays, when their separate foresty routines, took them both past the woodcutters cottage, where they dropped in in the hope of being offered a mug of piping hot cocoa. Sometimes they dropped in at the same time, so it could be a cozy threesome hovel in the unrelenting gloom of the woodcutters cottage. On one such Thursday, the woodcutter was as reluctant to speak as ever, but he happily poured out cocoa for his neighbors. The charcoal burner had brought some charcoal to burn to keep him occupied. And the popping Dre was reminiscing about his Trotsky's days when he spent much of his time standing at the entrances to railway stations handing out pamphlets to passers by the woodcutter neither watched the charcoal being burned nor listened to the slurred anecdote of the popinjay. He sat in his chair, glowering the embers in the fireplace, nurturing his burning sense of injustice. Now the charcoal burner and the poppin Dre had hatched what they thought was a very clever plan to get the woodcutter to spill the beans. They reasoned that if they each claimed to have a burning sense of something, and babbled on about it in confessional mode to the woodcutter, he might well tell him of the injustice knowing that his soul so the charcoal burner pretended to have a burning sense of righteousness, and the popping Dre assumed a burning sense of indigestion. They were waiting in the gloom for an opportune moment to launch into an account of their counterfeit burning woes. This clever plan was not the only thing that was hatched on that Thursday, in the cellar of the woodcutters cottage, in a crate packed with straw, then that's all the clutter of eggs that as the charcoal burner burned charcoal, and not popping dry witted, began to crack. The beings inside the eggs were grown too large to be confined any longer. They were ready to be born and what beings they were startling forest creatures, crinkly and crumpled and covered in hoarfrost tiny now, when full grown, they would be as tall as the trees and as broad as a bound. Their fiber was matted, and the feathers that sprouted from their foreheads, were of colors beyond the known spectrum. There are many bulbous eyes. unleaded stared from quivering, stalked with the look of tragic reproach. The tears that drip from them sulfurous and boiling hot. If I had collapsible lungs and sharp fangs and great thumping hooves, and I'm milky paler, and beaks and ears and elbows and pop bellies.

When they crawled upon the earth, they turned the soil to muck to With maggots, and when they reared up on their hind legs and roared, they blotted out the sun. I had enormous brains and enormous shovel like paws and enormous ill will. They fed on everything living and dead and vomited most of it up again, making disgusting deafening noises. there and 10 I picked up signals from outer space, their inability to understand which caused them such fury that they ripped and tore and savaged whatever was in front of them with their long, pointy claws. When they were not roaring, they made a tremendous buzzing sound, and when neither roaring nor buzzing, they howled and whimpered a continuous stream of steam and smoke poured out of each of their numberless orifices poisoning the air around them. Like a hunchback, they moved within human speed, they left a trail of filth and pass in their wake, by spank of beer and gin and sweat and death. Nobody, not even the weird mad people who dwelt in the weirdest, deepest parts of the forest, kept them as pets, or wove pretty wicker baskets for them to doze in, or cosseted them or loved them. In his pamphlet on the forest beings, which is out of print, Dobson described them differently, but he had never seen one and he was working from unreliable sources. Indeed, he did not know they were hatched from eggs, believing in stayed the medieval superstition that they were formed from the breath of seagulls blown upon the excrement of Lady birds were such a fancy originated is unknown. The sound of the eggs cracking open was loud enough to be heard in the room above the cellar, and both the charcoal burner and the drink soaked eggs Trotskyist popping dry, cocked their ears and gave quizzical looks first of each other, and then at the woodcutter. The woodcutter remained as taciturn as ever slumped in his chair, taking great gulps from his mug of cocoa. He had sprayed himself that morning, with half a canisters worth of hengest, the scent for men of the forest, and there was an aura of indestructibility about him, as well as a burning sense of injustice. It was that sense of injustice, which had led the woodcutter to steal the eggs from the nest of a forest being matriarch. His mind had gone loopy long ago, and he thought that he would be able to train newborn forest beings, put them on leashes, and have them do his bidding. First, he would whet their appetites by letting them render and slash and gobble up the charcoal burner and the poppin J. And then he would set out with them on a long long journey, tracking down Benny and Bjorn and agneta and Anna fried one by one and wreak vengeance upon them for having so many years ago sacked him from their pop group on the day they signed their first recording contract. He had reckoned without the matriarch of course, she to her the cracking of her eggs, and now she loomed huge and hideous over the wood cutters cottage, deep in the forest, where no one with any sense would ever dwell for it's a weird and eerie place, and it's teeming with monsters.

As we know, Christmas is a time for families and family entertainment, and this is an outdoor game that will bring gleeful smiles to tinies and adults alike. Buy a bag of plums from the greengrocers and whistle as you and your family strive purposefully to work place of puddles. It might be a canal towpath, or a field or even a derelict shopping precinct, and there need only be a single puddle. Type take the plums out of the bag and distribute them to the family members so that everyone has the same number. If the numbers of persons and plums do not match Drop, you can either put the plumbers back into the bag and go back to the greengrocers to buy some more, or have one or more family members carted away by the secret police. Once you've settled that, the game can begin. Each takes their turn to throw their plum or plums into the puddle. If someone's plum misses the puddle and lands on the towpath or the grass or the concrete, they can either take their turn again, or pay a forfeit, such as being carted away by the secret police. When all the problems are bobbing about in the puzzle, the game is over. And you can all go home, taking a short detour past the secret police interrogation center to attempt to retrieve any family members who have been carted there. This will usually be pointless. However, as the secret policeman at the gate will deny any knowledge of your family members and insist that the interrogation center is button innocent warehouse or office building. Do not become jumpy, or ill tempered with the secret policeman or you're likely to become an unperson. After a period of interrogation, I knew won't be throwing any plums into any puddles ever again.

We like to keep bang up to date here hooting yard. So here's a quotation from a 1934 New Yorker profile of Gertrude Stein. It's quoted on a new blog I've discovered called daily routines, subtitled how writers, artists and other interesting people organize their days. Among those so far included, it's only been going for a short time, I think. But among those so far are Franz Kafka, Emily Dickinson, Charles Darwin and Anthony Trollope, among others, Truman Capote here I think as well. Neither Dobson nor pebble head has yet been attended to. And I may have to deal with those two Titans myself. Anyway, here's here's an extract from the slightly longer excerpt from the New Yorker profile 1934 of Gertrude Stein. Miss Stein likes to look at rocks and cows in the intervals of her writing. The two ladies drive around in their Ford to like come to a good spot. Then Miss Stein gets out and sits on a camp stall with pencil and pad, and Miss topclass fearlessly switches a cow into her line of vision. If the cow doesn't seem to fit in with Miss Stein's mood, the ladies get into the car and drive on to another cow. When the great lady has an inspiration, she writes quickly for about 15 minutes. But often, she just sits there looking at cows and not turning a wheel.

Those of you who read as well as Listen, those of you who read the hooting, your website will be aware that I certainly try to keep it updated fairly regularly 345 times a week. Not every day, but I do my best. But sometimes, of course, it descends into inactivity, as these things do. And that happened recently when I didn't post anything for over a week. And I felt that Readers should be have some kind of explanation of why there was nothing happening. So I wrote this little report. To explain what occurred to those of you fretting the silence that's descended upon hooting yd recently, be it known that I have for the past week or so been beset by hobgoblins that scampered out of the wainscot they may well have been Vatican hobgoblins for one of them let slip while besetting me that the cash point machine or ATM from which we had that morning withdrawn funds displayed it instructions in Latin. While I was aware that the Vatican City is the only state or statelet to have programmed its cash points, thus, I had no idea that hobgoblins had neither banknotes or indeed have money in any form. So intent was this particular hobgoblin on besetting me however, it took not a drop of notice of my politely shrieked queries regarding its financial affairs, so I'm none the wiser.

Another thing I didn't know was that for decades there had been hobgoblins skulking behind the wainscot biding their time. This was a shocking revelation. So quietly, had they been preparing to beset me over all those years that I did not have an inkling of their existence, nor had they betrayed their presence. When I was doing the odd bit of wine Scott related Do It Yourself handiwork in the dying days of the john major government. Armed with a second hand Barry Bucknall book, I'd been keen to cut my chops on a simple project, though, I must confess that I abandoned the work before the wind Scott was fully rejigged or whatever it was, I was doing to it. And I've more or less neglected to follow up with any other home improvement jobs in the succeeding years. There have been other calls upon my time, which I won't go into here, except to point out because it's pertinent that during the first years of the Blair administration, I learned much about he man wrestling holds, though as an observer, rather than as a practitioner. I had little opportunity to watch actual wrestling bouts with real wrestlers demonstrated the holds that I was learning about, and I relied for the most part on black and white diagrams sprinkled throughout to teach yourself he man wrestling holds book I had acquired at a rummage sale. So when the hobgoblins came scampering from the wainscot, I thought to effect a citizen's arrest or a series of citizens arrest. By using the techniques I talked myself through painstaking study of he man wrestling hold diagrams, often by candlelight on stormy winter nights. Last through lack of practice, I had grown rusty. After all, this was stuff I'd learned when Frank Dobson was the health secretary. It was that long ago. I was quite unable to gain any purchase on the limbs or necks of the besetting hobgoblins and they slithered and squirm from my grasp with Quicksilver ease. I wondered if I might persuade them to desist by poking them with a fork. Somewhere I had read that this was an effective deterrent with other types of Goblin, so it seemed a reasonable assumption that it would work with hobgoblins even ones which originated in the Vatican, if that was indeed the case. As I dashed into the kitchenette, flapping my hands at my beset as I recalled that the article I had read in a magazine devoted either to forks otter goblins, recommended first poking one's fork into a pickled onion. Thus, with the tines of the fork be coated with anti Goblin juices, including pickling brine. Now, as it happened, only the day before, in a fit of practitioners, I had gorged myself stupid on pickled onions and on other pickled items, and my cupboards were bare, at least in that food stuff subsection. poking my fork into a fairy cake or munchie reconstituted fish slice would not be remotely helpful, nor I surmised would steeping the tines of the fork in a jug of goat's milk. Nevertheless, I opened my cutlery drawer and took out one of my treasured margrave of Hogan Holland bad gas Gotham Graf folks from the dinner set presented to me all those years ago, around the time of Harold Wilson shock resignation. By the margrave his very own great great great granddaughter. Her name I recall was Dougie, the only googy I have ever come across safer the esteemed star of stage and screen googie withers born at 1917 it's his final set of cutlery is human ingenuity has ever fashioned, and I felt that the intrinsic quality of the fork could outweigh the absence of pickled onion residue, when it came time to poke it into one hobgoblin after another. That of course, was the task now before me, and I had no idea it would prove impossible. If you've ever tried to poke a hobgoblin with a fork, you will know why. Later, as I sat hopeless and full on in my armchair, dangling a bent margrave of Holland bad gas Gotham graph fork from my quivering hand, still beset by hobgoblins, seemingly more energetic than before. I reflected upon the manifold miseries of existence in this veil of tears.

I've only just recovered enough of my wits to write about those terrible days. This morning, for reasons I cannot explain. Each and every hobgoblin suddenly seems to be setting me and scuffled back behind the wainscot. Perhaps they had run out of cash and had to go to their infernal Latin cashpoint machine to replenish their hobgoblin e wallet. But that would hardly take all day and they show no sign of reappearing. I know though, that they're lurking there silent and still biding their time as hobgoblins do.

Christmas wouldn't be complete without the hooting yard Christmas gift guide. I usually pick all of my gifts for family and friends from a little pamphlet I've got which is a 1994 Price List of devotional articles from St. Rita's promotions. Based in Honiton in Devon. It's a 1994 prices of course, and the telephone number given is probably out of date, but they've got some absolutely fantastic gifts. For example, a colored picture of St. Rita set in fancy plastic gilt frame, which is one pound 10 and oxidized metal of St. Rita one inch by half an inch which is only 20 page. booklet on the life of St. Rita by the late father fry 37 pages 30 P. and a booklet on the life of st Rita By Jove is Corcoran which is 45 p but it doesn't say how many pages in that one. You can also get a good strong rosary suitable for a man 24 inch long on strong silver colored train junction and crucifix colors black or brown. And that'll set you back three pounds 75 and so it goes on there's many many exciting gifts. You can get a resin statue in antique coloring of the child of Prague for 12 pounds 35 or a lovely traditional colored rubberized statue of Lords for 16 pounds 45 and a beautiful hand painted white resin statue of the Immaculate Heart of Mary on a wooden base 10 inches high. The heart has a slightly pinkish hue with the same pinkish hue appearing very slightly through the garments. And that's only 11 pounds 95 or was 14 years ago. So all sorts of exciting gifts available. You can also get a prayer for peace with a lovely picture of St. Francis in the birds covered in plastic for 18 p or not covered in plastic for 15 P. Yes, St. Rita's promotions, the best place to buy your gifts. And I mentioned earlier the, the website and the fact that occasionally there there hiatuses or hayti when I don't write very much, but I do try to keep up. And last Sunday, the 14th of December came and went without my realizing that it marked the fifth birthday of the hooting yard website. So belatedly crack open those bottles of air rated lettuce water. There was of course, an earlier hooting outside on the interweb. But it was static in that it contains various stories and pictures and was very, very rarely updated. Anyway, five years ago this month, I decided to start hooting autism blog. And we've come a long way readers and listeners, you and I, and I thank you all for your support in whatever form it takes. Anyway, here for the hell of it is the very first item that was posted on hooting yard. It refers one point as the hooting yards search engine your which you can find probably buried somewhere in the archive on the web page, which is www dot hooting yard.org and this was five years ago last Sunday. And this was the very first posting vigilant readers of the hooting yard search engine you will note within it the splendid word be wolfen battlement. Like solipsism. This is a coinage by Horace Walpole, but sadly one which never caught on. When the future George the Third was a teenager, his grandfather tried to marry him off to a European Princess, much to the dismay of George's mother. The name of the princess was

Frank Key  27:32
Sophia Caroline Maria, daughter of the Duchess of Brunswick wolfen Buttle, under his mother's influence, George became fretful and I gasped at the proposal. And as Walpole wrote, he quote, declares violently against being booed, wolfen, battled, unquote. to resurrect the word successfully, perhaps it's necessary to widen it from the sense of being forced into an arranged marriage to being forced into anything one doesn't want to do. So start using it today. And, yes, I had doesn't seem to have caught on very much in the last five years, maybe the next five will be kinda to build wolfen battlement. And that's the end of hooting yards. For tonight. It's also the end of hooting yard for 2008 except as I said, for the Christmas special, which will be broadcast at some point I don't know when in the next two weeks. Thank you very much for listening. Don't forget to visit the website Don't forget to buy the books. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Bye bye
