Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Before we go any further pingback your ears and listen very carefully. The annual fundraiser for resonance is running from February the 13th to the 21st. So that's in just over two weeks time, and more or less two weeks, and it will feature nine days of live events, a spectacular online auction, as well as a whole host of special broadcasts. resonance relies on the support of our listeners. So help us make more amazing programming by going to the resonance website and making a donation The best thing to do is to transfer the contents of your bank account into resonances bank account, you will feel a warm glow of righteousness if you do that. So yes, that's the annual fundraiser 13th to the 21st of February. This was a public service announcement on behalf of resonance FM. on with the show, as they say, it's become something of a cliche for people to say that they're frightened of clowns. Far more terrifying to my mind. Put it you know where you are with a clown in the big top where he got lumps across the sawdust with a bucket and a hooter. But, damn nubble put it let's be honest, if you were out and about sashaying along the street, taking the air and you saw sweeping through the air, and coming to rest hovering just above your head, I copy baby with a full head of curly hair and wings, and possibly armed with a dog with a bow and arrow. I think you would treat him terror and run screaming for the hills. This would be a mistake. The wisest thing to do in the circumstances would be to run screaming for shelter inside an enclosed building where you could barricade yourself in put he can fly but they cannot fly through brick walls. If you run for the hills, the party will follow you calling out to their party pounds to join them. And that call these are babies remember, so their call is a god awful infant squeal accompanied by girdling by the time you get to the hills bedraggled and panting there might be dozens or hundreds of them hovering around you like drones. If in your terror you pedal in your pants as you're likely to do the puddi will giggle in that horrible babyish way that's more like hiccups. Do you really want to find yourself alone in the hills beset by a swarm of hiccupping flying babies, some of whom have bows and arrows. The wards of our lunatic asylums are crammed with poor souls who made the mistake of trying to flee from pity in the open air. The other mistake people sometimes make is to think they can turn the tables on the armed party by shooting arrows at them, so they drop fatally wounded from the sky. This doesn't work, you cannot kill a potato. Unlike plop over clown, they are immortal. Thankfully, since renascence times we have seen rather less of the putty than we used to. Scientists are not sure what's caused the drop in numbers. It could be something to do with small, but they're still out there, cherub bacon terrifying and sweeping through the air flying babies. And you would do well to be on your guard.

Clap is one of those French words for which there is no precise equivalent in English. We take it to mean great brilliance in performance or achievement. Verve and DAC come close, but do not quite express a clap. Hence, where you Use a clap itself. For that which is we might say, essentially act flattie. talc a clap is brilliant of performance or achievement when one is liberally sprinkled with talc, but won't be tied he who aims for tout a clap when the liberal sprinkling of talc is too liberal. In her casebooks the pioneer of palindromic presentation dot Todd tells the sorry tale of a certain Arturo Ah, who was intent on cutting a dash in the display of tout a clap. I quote, it was a Thursday afternoon and Arturo, ah, a citizen of the Swiss canton of argao was preparing himself for a performance of tout a clap. He had recently witnessed a breathtaking display by an itinerant touted classist and believed he could do better and dazzle the people of argao, as they had never been dazzled before. And so, standing in his booth, voir, Arturo, he sprinkled himself liberally with talc. But oh, the liberality of his sprinkling was excessively liberal. He only ceased sprinkling when his talc container was empty. And even then, he went fossicking in his many, many cupboards for more talc, he found a small residue of talc and a Majolica bowl and sprinkle that on himself to eventually satisfied Arturo Ah, preened before his mirror, and then made his way downstairs, opened his front door and stepped into the boulevard. It was an important Boulevard thronged with citizens of argao Walking hither and thither at site of the excessively touts sprinkled Arturo Ah, however, people came to a standstill. They thought they saw a ghost, and not just any ghost, but now be no ghost. The terrible albino ghost of ancient argao legend, of whom stories were told to frighten children throughout the Canton. Some people on the boulevard swooned away in fright. A few emboldened by fear, attacked the ghost bashing Arturo ate relentlessly with their owl punch docks. He crumpled on the paving slabs in a drywall puzzle of talcum powder, in which soon was mingled the read of his precious lifeblood, forming a pinkish pool of honorable argao hora dots Todd adds a note to this cautionary tale, advising would be practitioners of tout a clap that a light dusting of talc is surely sufficient. Wise words from one who knows for what dot Todd does not say is that Arturo Ah, was her much loved Papa, who had dangled her on his knee when she was buttered taught and told her frightful Tales of the owl below ghost of ancient argao.

songwriters take pride in never repeating themselves. I'm really the opposite. I repeat myself all the time. And an example of hooting yard repetition appears in this next piece, which is called the unstacked toffee. One of the most perplexing cases to come to the attention of the psychic investigator algernon spooky was the so called affair of the unsuk toffee. In 1922, at a crumbling manor house in Google share, there were reports of the spectral manifestation of an albino ghost trailing in its wake several lives. chickens, a blind author, and an invisible spider of monstrous size. Their appearances were accompanied by inexplicable hissing, buzzing, tangling rattling, knocking, drumming, piping, squealing, yodeling, whooshing, rat attacking, screeching, moaning, plopping grinding, hammering, giggling, puffing, whistling, hooting gnashing gurgling, wheezing, babbling grunting, sucking noises distressed beyond measure, the sole resident of the house, the Dowager Duchess Dipsy of pox haven summoned algernon spooky to investigate. He arrived on a sopping wet Thursday in the company of his illegitimate daughter poo Belle, who acted as his amanuensis and a somewhat shady character, a half pay army officer, known as Captain troubleshooter, whose role in the party was unclear, twitching and shattered. He seemed to spend most of his time slathering his less than impressive Buffon with hair oil, and poring over pocket falls of doggy and betting slips. After hearing deputies account of the ghostly phenomena over tea and muffins, algernon spooky, declared confidently that he could entrap The Phantom by luring it with tahfiz. He then proceeded to distribute a bag full of toffee sweets removed from their paper wrappers throughout the house. The for some spooky, Dipsy poo Belle and Captain Trump. You're then sat in armchairs around the fireplace in the first floor sitting room, though, Captain Trump sure kept excusing himself to go skulking down to the wine cellar. The night passed without apparent incident, after breakfast of kittens and kedgeree, algernon spooky, accompanied by Pooh Belle toward the house to examine the toffees. He discovered that every single one of them showed signs of having been sucked, and in some cases, crude, except for one. This toffee placed and then the skirting board in the disused billiards room was pristine, both unstacked and uncrewed. Tell me your thoughts and I shall write them down, said pu bell to her propel her propelling pencil poised over her notepad as they stood puzzling over the unstacked toffee. But before the cyclic investigator could utter a word that came from far below the blood curdling sound of squawking was this one of the albino ghost chickens. Spooky and his amanuensis sprinted downstairs to the boot room, where they found the Dowager Duchess slumped on the floor, surrounded by feathers, and with blood dripping from her mouth. Beside her on the floor, with the corpse of a chicken, from which the head had been bitten clean off. In the opposite corner of the room, Captain crumpsall was slathering his less than impressive Buffon with hair oil, and poring over a pocket full of doggie betting slips. It was a scene I hope to never to see said algernon spooky, speaking in the past tense for the benefit of poo Belle, who was taking down his word with her propelling pencil in her notepad preparatory to the compilation of his memoirs. And quite frankly, he continued, it only deepened the mystery.

Had Dixie swallowed the entire head of the chicken, who or what had lured her into the boot room, was the monstrous invisible spider lurking within unseen why precisely was Captain troubleshoot on half pay? Was I speaking slowly enough for my illegitimate daughter and man uncle Pooh Belle to take always down accurately and free of these slapdash errors that crept into the work of my previous manual answers, who I had to push off a cliff in the Alps. Was this one of the Urbino ghost chickens? Or was it another chicken entirely? And most pertinently of all, why was just one of the several toffees I scattered significant places throughout the house and sucked and who, or what had sucked the other toffees. If there are answers to any of these questions, they lie perhaps in realms beyond our puny human senses. That, my friends is the ineffable mystery of the times in which we live eldritch and spooky times, I strive to record that posterity may gape in wonderment or or wonder, Wonder would be better than wonderment Don't you think pu Bell, pu bell to bell. But pu Bell had vanished inexplicably in a puff of vapor, leaving only the scent of Calla Lilies hanging in the boot room air.

Some of you may have recognized that algernon spooky is loosely based on Alistair Crowley. The difference between them is that Alistair Crowley likes to call himself the great beast with the number 666 outrun on spooky called himself the greater beast because he turned the number of the beast up to 667 Dobson was saving the 20th century's great out of print pamphleteer was sitting at his breakfast table absolutely seething. pausing before spooning a dollop of marmalade style peppers jelly D or doing to her mouth, Dobson's in amaranta. marigold true observed, you will pay to be seeing Dobson Indeed, I am Oh light of my life, send the pamphlet here. I have a lengthy list of exasperate options, which I would happily recite to you, the better that you might understand the multifarious sources of my saving. Perhaps not Dobson said marigold true. Instead, I would rather that you've seen elsewhere than at the breakfast table. Have you considered going to seeding to seed? I have not said Dobson, and where in the name of high heaven is seeding. seeding is a tiny village in the county of Norfolk said marigold to about nine miles southeast of Northridge. It's trudge St. Margaret's, as a Round Tower, though, that is not strictly relevant. I am told that the villages of seething often sees about all sorts of aspirations, and I feel sure you would find a welcome there. Then see then see thing I shall shouted Dobson, and he rose from the table, pulled on his Ivory Coast crop, dusting copilot boots, and crashed out of the door into the teeming downpour. So heavy was the rain. so thick the mist so broken his pocket campus that the pamphleteer became almost immediately lost. When eventually he came to a halt, he was not in the ceiling at all. Dobson had wondered as far as the county of Cornwall, and found himself in the tiny village of splat Dobson was splatting.

Saving and splat are both real places I had been to splat there's not much of it. But what there is is kind of falling down and ramshackle and dilapidated. seating is a lovely little religion Norfolk and many years ago when I lived in Norwich, my landlord major James Alcock lived in thieving. Yes, so, plan daytrips, the seasoning and, and splat and you can kind of live out the hooting yard experience. tribulations of the button maker is an opera by the French Aboriginal Australian composer didgeridoo it has not been performed since the early 19th century, possibly because of its vast cast loopy libretto, and its musical pomposity in Act One, Fulgencio the button maker is beset by tribulations.

Ghana pit King found himself stranded behind enemy lines. He hated a bomb. There was a cow in the barn. It was an enemy cow. Back in the field tent, Ghana, Pipkin had had dimmed into his head by the captain, where his duty lay. It was an enemy cow, so he had to kill it. Ghana pickin was not the brightest of men, but he realized that if he used his gun to shoot the cow, the noise of the report could alert the enemy to his presence in the barn. Back in the field 1010 Ghana pickin had had DinDin to his head by the captain, that part of his duty was to avoid capture at all costs. Excuse me. I'll read that again. Back in the field 10 Ghana pickin had had defendant his head by the captain, but part of the duty was to avoid capture at all costs. Ghana, Pipkin looked wildly around the barn, seeking an instrument by which he might bring about the death of the enemy cow. But silently he saw a turn at a home and a spade. gala Pipkin put down his gun and picked up the spade. He approached the cow ganache Pitkin hoisted the spade Hi, ready to bring it bashing down repeatedly and relentlessly applauding cow's head then it occurred to him that their lives the dearest freshness, deep down things, even cows, even enemy cows. He put the spade down, gonna pick in lay upon a bale of straw and fell asleep. Several hours later, he was captured by the enemy. In the prisoner of war camp, Ghana picking occupied his time making toy cows out of balsa wood and dough. By the time the piece was signed on Luna Berg Heath, he had made hundreds of toy cows. They can now be found in a museum, a converted barn and a daffodil splattered field that used to be behind enemy lines.

Alert readers familiar with the poetry of the Victorian Jesuit, Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of noted the little quotation inserted in that piece from Gods grander their lives the dearest their lives the dearest freshness deep down things. Anyway. Oxford University Press recently published volume eight of its majestic Collected Works of Gerard Manley Hopkins. The latest book, a snippet 110 pounds, is devoted to the diaries, journals and notebooks. As a good Catholic Hopkins kept a record of the sins he committed. And this new edition includes the previously suppressed details. We learn for example of frequent bouts of old age old habits. I think we can guess what that means, and of occasions when unseemly thoughts are prompted by the sight of choristers, kart boys and other young men. But several other entries are suggestive of the fathomless depths of the poet sickening depravity and moral turpitude. Hopkins confesses in the privacy of his diary to and I quote, and these are sins remember looking at and thinking of stallions? And worse, much, much worse. Self indulgence at Croydon in fruit. How Gerard Manley Hopkins escaped prison is one of the enduring mysteries of Victorian Jesuit literature. Anyway, if you've got 110 pounds to spare, which you probably haven't, because you'll have been sending it to resonance instead, as part of the fundraiser. How do you have that 110 pounds? I think that would be money well spent. And there's something about the phrase self indulgence at Croydon in fruit that I just find absolutely wonderful even though of course it caused poor father Hopkins such spiritual pain. That's the end of the show this week. Thanks to Patrick for stepping in as my last minute engineer because john is apparently if you're listening, john, get well soon. That's the end of this week's show. Bye bye
