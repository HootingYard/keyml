Welcome to hooting yard on the air. With me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. Before we go any further, I would just like to thank Neal Jones, who very generously sent a donation to resonance and said that he very much enjoyed hooting yd on the air, so that we can dedicate more dedicate this show to Neal Jones. Oh, he said it with his favorite program. So, you know, obviously a very sensible man. And this this shows that so this show is dedicated to him. And it begins as follows. I just kicked something. Apparently, I kicked a bucket, one bucket verb bucket, it's the only bucket in the room, and I kicked it inadvertently. Dobson was an excessively tidy man. He firmly believed the old soul which insists there is a place for everything and everything in its place. Thus he kept sweets in jars and jars on shelves in cupboards. This despite his loading of confectionery. When asked why he stored so many sweets, including humbugs, tahfiz and jammy teardrops in labeled jars on labeled shelves in labeled cupboard, Dobson, clustered and try to change the subject. I would look he might say, pointing out with a window, a mother Shrike with her Shrike klutz, or, what would you say with the chief causes of the box arising? In the latter example, it would not bother pointing out the window, but my Pharaoh his brow, as if he had been pondering the topic for some time. This sneaky yet transparent technique, what surprisingly often few people other than marigold to felt confident enough in the pamphleteers presence to Calonge Dobson. The explanation for this lies not in any personal magnetism or force of personality. In fact, for the life of me, I cannot think why he got away with his preposterous behavior. cutlery alignment in cutlery drawers was another type of tidiness which exercised the great man and particularly fraught times he was known to align and realign the cutlery and the cutlery drawer 10 times an hour. Sometimes he would be halfway along the path to the pond to commune with swans, then turn on his heel and stamp back into the house to attend to the knives and forks. Nowadays, of course, some pop psychologists would make a television documentary, asserting that Dobson suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder, but I think we can safely reject such a notion. It's not as if he was washing his hands every five minutes, or going do Lowry if touched by a miniscule fleck of glitter. Instead, he'll probably to have washed his hands more often, but I will invariably ink splattered and grubby in other ways, particularly if he had been down by the pond with the swans. No, I think we can rely on Dobson's own account of the cutlery issue, which he addressed in a pamphlet entitled, keeping cutlery aligned tied to me in the cutlery drawer as an absolute imperative if one aspires to be fully human, out of print. For reasons I need not go into here, hardly anybody has ever bothered to read this middle period work. The prose is clogged and clunky, the views expressed idiotic and when typesetting it marigold crew chose so tiny a font that the average reader needs an extremely powerful magnifying glass to decipher the text. Oh, forgive me, I just went into the reasons why hardly anybody has ever bothered to read this middle period work.

Dobson will describe This little slip to the fact that his cutlery drawer sorry. Dobson will describe that little slip to the fact that the cutlery in my cutlery drawer is chaotic and askew? Am I not then fully human? And if not, what am I, partly ape? Perhaps I wouldn't be able to answer those questions if I myself had read the pamphlet, but I confess I've not done so. My eyesight is not up to it. I could perhaps employ some bright eyed literally youngster to read it to me, a perky little brain box. I'm cowed by Latin tags and arcane references and paragraphs that go on and on and on for 12 pages or more by clogged and clunky prose in idiotic views. But where would I find such a creature? I suppose I could take a stroll in the rain down to the nearest Community Education hub, but that would be the act of a desperate man. Better by far surely others to accept my semi human status. To give vent to my inner eight punter stuffed my face with bananas and nuts, or conversely to go and align the cutlery in the cutlery drawer with dobsonian precision and just destroy the eight foot books with me. It's a simple choice and one I shall not shirk from making.

Frank Key  06:46
About 30 years ago, I wrote a short piece in which I described being hunched among shimmer rings. Looking back, it occurs to me that I didn't really know what I was talking about. I was just blathering. I often blathered in those days, both vocally and when doing my scribblings, I think I was simply unclear about what I wanted to say. much has changed. For now I have a close eagle eyed vision, and I'm somewhat better able to communicate it. Oh, I still fall prey to blather more often than I ought to. But I've learned to nip it if not in the bud. Then before too many tendrils have swarmed across the some dappled pathway that leads to truth and beauty and insight. You see, there really is a bright magnificent up land upon which we can prance if we can but reach it. I know that now. So when 30 odd years ago, I wrote about hunching among the shimmer rings, I was unable to do much more than to simply report the fact the significance of my experience escaped me. But last week, I found myself once again so hunched among shimmer rings, and now I'm equal to the task of writing about it properly. It was Tuesday morning and I was exhausted after a sleepless night, fueled by vimto and boil in the bag liquidized macaroni. I'd been sitting up studying the flight patterns of Britons and sanderlings to prepare myself for a bird related q&a session. I was I was due to attend. There are many such calls on my attention, and I usually decline them but this one was a fundraiser for a cause close to my heart. So I was taking part. If I could help to raise a pittance for the toward grip, tracksuit Museum, I was ready to immerse myself in bird flight patterns for as long as it took. And if truth be told, I found the subject fascinating. By the time Tuesday dawn, however, my poor brain pans and turned to move, and I needed some fresh air. Not far from where I live beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing, there is the shack of a mystic. I am in no doubt that like most mystics, the mystic who dwells in the shack is a fraud. Like TV psychologist, Dr. Raj persona, he is an incorrigible plagiarist, calling his mystic pronouncements from other mystics, some of whom live like him in shacks by level crossings, some of whom live in palaces, and some of whom are dead. Yes, I often find it refreshing to hear. Yes, I often find it refreshing to head out at dawn, and to blister him by throwing pebbles at his shack. That at any rate with my plan, I filled my pockets with pebbles from my pebble pot and flooded out of the house, stamping my feet with vigor upon the green earth. I do not mean that the earth upon which I thumped was literally Green. I'm trying to impress upon you that I'm attuned to nature, a true friend of the earth, sort of pebble throwing version of Jonathan pirate. It is true that I do not care to pins about my carbon footprint. And perhaps that's why I do not get to jet around the world in gleaming aircraft to attend conferences on global warming, like Al Gore, but I do not complain. I have my little baby wick and I crunched the green earth hugging the occasional Sycamore or you tree, when to do so takes my fancy. On this particular morning, though, I did not stop to commune with any trees. I was fired up and in a hurry, and I whistled as I made my way past the weird caves and the duck pond and the industrial funnel manufacturing compound and Zaretsky gazebo, and the enormous Crusher and the two different statues of Condoleezza Rice towards the shack of the mystic beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing. I am no expert Whistler by any means, but I'm enthusiastic. annoyingly. So. And as I walked, I whistled existential by pragmatic from their 1978 debut EP. It suited my mood.

Frank Key  11:24
So there I was purposeful and full of them. Yet within 10 minutes I was hunched among shimmer rings, my pockets empty of pebbles and my teeth chattering I wish I could tell you how it happened, but I cannot. The eerie shimmering has engulfed me with terrible suddenness. I sank to the ground, the pebbles in my pockets somehow dissolved or vanished as if they'd never been there at all. The air grew cold, then hot. a hunch they're defenseless. A tiny blob in a vast universe of shimmer rings. This has happened to me before, three decades ago, as I mentioned, then I wrote, hunched among the shimmer rings. Forget what I just said. Forget what I just said.

Frank Key  12:48
Within the days I boot polish that I was banished from the palace. I had done nothing wrong. But one Thursday morning they came for me in my cubicle and told the paperwork for my elegant pans and told me that I was to be banished. I was led to a cupboard where I was told to deposit my pencils and my hat, and then to another cupboard where there were many, many shelves stacked oh so high with packets of nuts. So they told me I could take six packets to eat you have peanuts and hazelnut, one of pine nuts and one of Brazil nuts. I was to cram them into my pockets and pack the flaps down. It was made very clear to me that my pockets would be rummaged through as I stepped outside the palace to begin my banishment. And if I had more than six packets of nuts about my person, banished from banishment from the palace would be the least of my worries. It was not entirely clear to me what this meant. But it was not meant to be clear to me. It was intended that I'd be stricken with terror and have my imagination run riot at the prospect of some gruesome fate. In truth, I did not get myself into a little flap, for I have always been law abiding, and I have no intention of taking more than my allotment of nuts. I have twice mentioned flaps, material flaps and emotional flaps. And before I'm through, I may refer to other flaps, which we'll see. Once I have packed my pockets with my six packets of nuts and patted down the flaps, they told me to come out of the cupboard, and as soon as I was in the corridor, they slam the cupboard door shut with such unnecessary violence that I jumped into the air for a second. The ceiling was high enough that I did not crack my head on it. I understood why they had instructed me to pack down my pocket flaps because had I not done so one or more of the packets of nuts may have fallen from my pocket during my inadvertent little jump. I got the impression waiting for their next move that they had expected me to jump Around the corner of the corridor, one of them now appeared wiggling a gurney. They told me to clamp onto it and to lie down on my back, and then they strapped me to it with a series of buckled wooden woolen belt. It was explained to me that this wood was all part of the standard banishment procedure, and that I should read nothing sinister into it. So I didn't. I felt quite relaxed, staring at the grimy yellow ceiling of the corridor. As I was wheeled along. I mused about the dado boot polish, and wondered if they were coming to an end. It was hard to tell. We arrived at a junction and turned into another corridor. This one had a ceiling was also yellow, but much less grimy. After a while my Gurney gathered to a stop. I was unbuckled, and they told me to get off it and stand up. I did as I was told, and saw that I was in a part of the palace that I had never seen before. But this did not surprise me, for I always knew that I was kept to only certain areas of what must have been a tremendously large building. Now I was going to be thrown out of it all together with six packets of nuts to see me on my way. I did find this all very curious, but they showed no sign of giving me any explanation. So I kept my mouth shut. There was a cold rush of air to my left and I looked around and saw that a sliding door had switched open and beyond it was open air, a field, some shriveled vegetation, distant cows and a magnificent blue sky. I had not seen the like since before the days Oh boot polish. And for the first time since they injected me from my cubicle, I spoke God, I said one of them whacked me on the windpipe with a tally stick and I crumpled to the floor. My pattern down pocket flaps kept my sick packets of nuts safe from spillage. It took me some while to get my breath back. And then they lifted me to my feet. I heard an ungodly beeping noise. This was coming from a wall panel which form part of the stupendously complicated palace communication system installed at the very beginning of the days I boot Polish when inventions were still welcomed. I knew it ran on electricity and pneumatic but beyond that its workings were a mystery to me. The beeping turned out to be a signal confirming my banishment. They turned out my pocket and as soon as they were satisfied that I was carrying no more than six packets of nuts.

Frank Key  17:50
I was shoved in the small of the back out into the field and the sliding doors were shut behind me. I walked away from the palace in more or less a straight line for about an hour. Then the sky was filled suddenly, with dozens of swordfish jet planes with military markings. Dozens of planes skipping and swooping, making a terrible game. I clapped my elegant hands over my equally elegant is to stifle a racket without much success. While I was standing there being a bit weedy, one of the planes came into land about 50 cements away and disgorged a troupe of howler monkeys, who immediately came charging towards me howling and howling. They grabbed my arms and legs, lifted me off my feet, bundled me into a tarpaulin and carried me off towards the plane. I noticed a solitary Starling in the blue sky. Once inside the plane, which took off again as soon as I had been ferried aboard, I was tossed from the tarpaulin onto a surprisingly comfortable bunk and injected with a serum. This gave me a splitting headache, but also caused me to begin babbling in urgent and breathless gulping sobs. Everything I knew about the palace, and the days I boot polish. I couldn't stop myself, even when one of the howler monkeys passed me a tumbler of refreshing milkshake. I ended up spitting most of it onto the floor, so desperate was to tell everything I could drag drop from the deepest nooks of my brain. It was all quite involuntary. None of the howler monkeys was taking notes. In fact, they did not seem particularly interested in what I had to tell. I prattled on for at least a day, if not more, before falling back on the bunk completely spent. They gave me some more milkshake and this time I drained my tumbler with lipsmacking relish. Then I fell asleep. That was lost. week this week for how the monkeys have asked me to help them to make a scale model of the pallets out of corrugated cardboard. I will give them what help I can. I've already given them the six packets of nuts that were the tokens of my banishment. The days I boot Polish are over now at long last, and I for one will not miss them. I have enough on my plate, ushering in the days Oh cellophane to a colony of 100,000 howler monkeys, learning to how just like them, but perhaps with a touch more elegance.

Frank Key  20:58
Somewhere in yesterday's papers, I came across the phrase of vasque and chili gasworks. And this reminded me that for ages now I've been meaning to tell you about the Ballista line gasworks. More specifically, excuse more specifically, I wish to address the time that the manager of the gasworks approached Dobson the out of print pamphleteer, asking him to write an introduction manual for the gasworks janitor. The word vast and chilly certainly describe the barista like gasworks, to a tee. They describe to the manager, a man of huge bulk and cold disposition named his van pan. his mustache was of the Kaiser vilhelm type, and his eyes were gracile. Interestingly, interestingly, no one could ever Excuse me. Interestingly, no one could ever recall seeing him off the gasworks premises and how he lived and fended Ray's everyday needs was a complete mystery. Equally perplexing was the fact that in his left hand at all times he carried a hammer, almost as if it were an extension of his arm. Perhaps it was so clearly was his manner that no one had the temerity to ask him about it. janitors came and went at the gasworks with bewildering rapidity. Sam left voluntarily after a few days or weeks, and others were fired by his fan pan, often within minutes of their appointment. Curiously, does a single x janitor would speak of their experience remaining steadfast in their silence, even when badgered for a scoop by a bumptious reporter from the daily shovel. It is Against this background that one needs to consider Dobson's response when he was summoned to the gasworks by his fan pan. Unfortunately, we do not know how the pamphleteer reacted because there is a gap in his journals covering this period. He may have crowed with your might or he might have shattered with queasiness, but we're unlikely ever to know. So let's just crack on and find out what happened next. Dobson presented himself at the gasworks gate promptly at six o'clock in the morning on a Monday of blustery gales and drizzle. He was met by a woman so tiny that he mistook her for a female her monk keyless and wondered if she had been created. According to the para celsion recipe of burying a bag of bones, semen skin fragments and hair in the road for 40 in the mud for 40 days. Tak versus ever. Dobson wondered This allowed and had his knee slapped by the tiny woman. Had she been any taller. No doubt she would have slapped his face, but his knee was as high as she could reach. She introduced herself as Mrs. Pan wife of the gas work manager, and by Dobson follow her done a very long corridor hitting with gas jets. At the end of week was his van pans office. As enormous as his wife was miniscule his fan pan towered above the pamphleteer as he coldly outlined what he wanted Dobson to do for him. Before appointing a new gasworks janitor he explained he wanted to have an instruction manual, clearly setting out the janitorial duties, and he wanted it to be written in sweeping magisterial prose, so that whoever took on the job would be properly austrac. As he said this he flailed his hammer in the air He went on to say in a voice redolent of Antarctic deprivation, that Dobson had been recommended to him as a writer of sweeping magisterial prose. And as a man who knew a thing or two about granite Adam Dobson was curious to know who might have made such a recommendation, but just as he was about to ask, Mrs. Pan rushed into the office with a stricken look on her tiny face. The pamphleteer was astonished to see his van pan's cold imperiousness crumble into serious solicitude, as he swept his tiny wife into his arms, and without dropping his hammer, comforted her, chirping into her ear softly, like a minute.

Frank Key  25:50
eventually becomes Mrs. Pan explained why she was stricken. They had been a pop up on the blister line bypass, she said, just beyond the gasworks, and fumes and flames will be blown by the blustery gales in their direction. Unless they took action, the whole place could explode in a conflagration like the one that engulfed the potato building just after the war is fan pan, look Dobson coldly in the eye and told him that this was just the kind of circumstance where a company where a competent janitor would be a boon and the pamphleteer could only nod in agreement. Then the guesswork manager turned round and depressed a knob upon his desk. And Dobson felt a sudden lurch in the pit of his stomach. It took him a few seconds to realize the entire vast and clearly gasworks was descending via the thrumming of some incredible and complicated engine below the surface of the earth into a subterranean vault as vast and chilly as the gas worked itself. While above ground, the Firestorm created by the Ballista mine bypass pileup raged and rage for days and weeks and months. For many years now, Dobson is hunted higher mo for a copy of the legendary missing pamphlet, how I spent six months underground in an amazing subterranean vault built to house the Ballista lane gasworks, together with Mr. And Mrs. Pan and their cat who did breath. If ever a coffee can be discovered. We might learn what happened in that time. And more importantly, why when its fan pan last press the knob to return the gasworks to ground level. His plans to have a janitorial instruction manual written in sweeping and magisterial prose by Dobson seemed to have been utterly abandoned. We might learn to whether it was giant his van pan or tiny Mrs. Pan, or even perhaps Dobson himself, who managed to train who the brass the cat to carry out all the tasks the manager expected of a vast and chilly gasworks janitor. And that is the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.

Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers and wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you.
