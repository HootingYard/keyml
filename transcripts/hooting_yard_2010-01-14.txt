was a really good station ident I enjoyed that. This is Frank K. This is hooting out on the air. There are now four books available from hooting art, go to the website and there's four hooting yard books, or three books and a booklet. The latest one is a booklet entitled. We were puny. They were vapid and it contains three early stories from before my wilderness years early 90s from and this is one of them. This is called the phlogiston variations. Winslow phlogiston variations, hooting yard ensemble director low supreme editions determined catalog number e c t w 14078. CDs mid price. unwrapping the cellophane from this handsome boxed set took me the best part of an hour. Such was my excitement, that the word butter fingers might have been coined for me. And it was only by dint of a pair of extremely sharp scissors that I eventually succeeded. That was not the end of my troubles. For I had the devil of a job to discard the shredded, wrap it into my wastepaper basket. gleaming strands of cellophane stuck resolutely to my fingers. However desperately I flap my arms around, I could conjure a casting a peculiarly inept spell. is this relevant? Well, yes, I think it is. The tactile struggled to extricate the box from its packaging was nothing compared to the auditory struggle I then underwent, listening at one sitting to the nine hours and 47 minutes of the quite majestic phlogiston variations. Younger listeners may be unfamiliar with the work of the Alaskan Flemish composer chlorine and Dinah Winslow 1882 to 1941. operetta the paving slabs was recently revived by a troupe of Finnish amateurs and the jazz Spinetta, Denis Zhao, it included a version of the retention of milk on his 1991 solo album. But otherwise this towering figure of 20th century music has fallen victim to almost criminal neglect. So this reissue of the phlogiston variations, recorded by the hooting yard ensemble in 1959 is more than welcome. And well perhaps go some way towards the rehabilitation of Winslow. I've never understood why she's been all but forgotten. At the peak of her success in the 1920s. Her works were regularly performed in concert halls throughout the world, and critical plaudits were bestowed on her even by such cantankerous misanthropes is Wrigley who memorably described her as, quote, the greatest Alaskan composer of the last and probably the next 500 years. Unquote.

Winslow had, in fact left Alaska at the age of four. Her mother, a weasel breeder of Flemish extraction, fled the country after her husband Winslow's father was shot dead in one of these sporadic outbreaks of gang warfare which blighted a fog Mack island in the Gulf of Alaska during the 1880s. Mother and daughter moved first to Sumatra, then traipse through various seaside resorts in the north of England before settling in Danzig in 1896. Winslow had found a precocious talent as a bassoonist and her mother enrolled her in some sort of cut price music school in the city, run by Professor ignatz milkbone, a wizard old gate of questionable morals, whose police record filled at least two entire filing cabinets in the basement storeroom of the Danzig, Western District criminal justice headquarters. He was a foul, foul man, and a teacher of genius. Winslow studied under milkbone for 11 years in all, in that time, if you develop from a promising teenage bassoonist into an all round musical talent of frightening proficiency, her first composition proper the sweet For string quartet, large drum train whistle caster nets and medicine balls was written when she was 17. At the very end of the 19th century, she was anticipating the innovations for which Shrek rent Willis and Toad brow would take credit 20 or 30 years later. One wintry morning in 1907, Professor milkbone was arrested in the middle of Winslow's glockenspiel lesson. He was charged with multifarious crimes, to all of which he confessed and imprisoned for a very long time. This was a decisive event for the young composer. Milk bones pedagogue he was so rich, so only for curative that to have broken from him voluntarily was near impossible. In time, no doubt it would have stifled the wild and inventive creative impulse to which Winslow now grave free reign, forced by circumstance to go her own way. She embarked on a series of works which to those of us privileged to have heard them continue to astonish the ears decades after they were written. This is not the place to attempt a biography of chlorine Winslow. In any case, her life was one of unremitting tedium, as attested by Sidney ollege, who complained of the absence of even the teensy weensy speck of interest in her life after milk bone had been packed off to prison. Nonetheless, between 1907 and her death in 1941, Winslow created a corpus of work arguably unrivaled by any of her contemporaries. The ideas spilled out of her with dizzying fecundity. The phlogiston variations completed in 1929 is let us remind ourselves Opus 954. Winslow began work on the variations in 1924 planning at first a series of linked cantatas to be sung by a Boys Choir to the accompaniment of a brass band, eight separate orchestras, a pickup jazz combo and an amateur ensemble from the Danzig metallurgical Institute, performing a polar motley collection of laboratory equipment. The first section to be completed the Passacaglia and ritual execution for Viola da gamba and mast Bunsen burners was abandoned to be revived in the final score transformed into a duet for exhaust pipe and whimpering. She wrote most of the sulfurous impenetrability Leah and spleen in the gutter movements, before a commission from the job and government to compose a new national anthem forced her to put the variations aside for a couple of years. Then, throughout 19 2017, she was embroiled in the disentanglement of Professor milk bones a state he had died on st finished his day still in prison, and had made Winslow the exact tricks of his will. Not until December 1927. The tree managed to track down the principal beneficiary pansy cradle Jew, the professor's sixth cousin eight times removed, who lived in a log cabin in the midst of snow and gales somewhere in the vast wilderness of Greenland.

Frank Key  08:42
The variations were completed in a frenzied bout of work during the first half of 1929 and first performed in October of that year, in a Buttercup splattered field within the grounds of the Danzig metallurgical Institute. With Winslow herself conducting and playing the trombone. The reviews were uniformly ecstatic. James pilgrim the mackerels, field Gazette, proclaiming that having experienced this music, I would happily be struck Deaf tomorrow. Winslow I wrote the libretto of the variation so itself, it was based upon Joseph Priestley's the doctrine of phlogiston established and that of the composition of water refuted 1800 Priestley had argued that phlogiston was a substance or principle, supposed to exist in combination in all combustible bodies. In other words, it was the very matter of fire itself. The hypothesis had first been expanded by style in 1702. By the time Priestley published his work a century later, it had fallen into disrepute. Most scientists by then considering it nonsensical rubbish, Priestley stoutly maintained his belief in the existence of phlogiston and it was this willful independence of mind, which attracted Winslow, her priestly as a tragic hero Wittering on about his theories, the text taken verbatim from his book, while a so called pompous chorus of scientists tries to shout him down. Sanchez the massive scale of the work that following the 1929 premiere, no one attempted a complete performance again until the hooting yard ensembles recording 30 years later. Winslow included excerpt from the variations in a number of concerts during the 1930s but it was considered too formidable a score for anyone else to have a crack at it. In his autobiography, the my stroke to darky belig gave a revealing account of the general reluctance to perform the work. I remember hanging around in a Marseille Tavern with a bunch of internationally successful conductors. He wrote, as we sank jar after jar of tough metal O's ale. Our talk ranged over the entire history of Western music. We tried to outdo each other, arguing that our own interpretations of various works were definitive, majestic, timeless performances which left nothing further to be said. For example, grudge claim that his series of Helsinki concerts, in which he conducted all 49 binders symphonies made any future approach to them a complete waste of time. No sooner had he said this than Vaughn pig flask spat into his beer and counted that his own version of binders 20th, recorded with the Ivory Coast state radio orchestra was absolutely the last word on the piece. That binders granddaughter had been present in the studio, and had wept great buckets of tears during the final movement. And what's more, graduates own handling of the pisser Carter had been otiose laughable, and the object of derision among all of his Vaughn pig flasks, Rafi and Lee but musical pals grunch did not take this line down. Immediately, he let rip with a contemptuous diatribe upon the failings of Vaughn pig flasks 1949 version of our heads, chocolate swiss roll Sonata pausing only to let the waiter bring more drinks to the table and to mop up the spillages and vomit. He then launched into a tirade on the virtues of his unstrap nod Taub concertos, provoking bag brain who sat beside me to tip the contents of his tangled over grudges head. And so it went on until someone or other it might even have been me, mentioned Winslow's phlogiston variations. For the first time that night, there was silence around our table.

Frank Key  13:17
Vaughn pig flask stared ruminatively into his glass bag brain made a show of shuffling a deck of spittle, students playing cards grudge lurched off to the toilet. Others use similar rousses to avoid having to make any comment. I cannot. I cannot remember what I did. Perhaps I simply sat there dribbling for that's what I often do, in situations fraught with tension, as any of my Maestro acquaintances would tell you. The first to speak was poor old Sopwith, but he was by now so drunk that none of us could understand a word he said. But at least he had the courage to say something. Taking our cues. introverts in turn admitted that enormously talented as we were our Titanic egos shriveled that the prospect of tackling Winslow's masterpiece. to attempt it, we all felt was to risk cataclysmic failure. That evening, I confessed for the first time to a recurring nightmare I had, in which I stood down from the podium after conducting a performance of the complete variations, to be met with uproarious laughter, a hideous combination of ridicule and contempt, and the cackling den grew louder and louder until I woke based in sweat, and nearly suffocating myself with a pillow.

Frank Key  14:50
Enter then, lo thar priem printer Paul conductor of the hooting yard ensemble, and a man every bit as vain and extravagantly blue counted as the gang in darky Billings memoir, indeed, so convinced was proven of his own genius that he held himself aloof from the Society of his fellow conductors, whom he considered in his own words, worms, maggots repellent vermin fit only for the decisive incinerator of history. preen had made his reputation with his tremendous 1952 rendering of owl head surgical opera starlin cured my palsy. 1957 he replaced winter mark as commander in chief of the hooting yard ensemble and astonished the players at his first meeting with them. We gathered together in a little hot hard by the banks of the river recalls accordionist durveys calc. All of us sat there on wooden stools, and makeshift stage had been erected at one end of the room on which had been placed a sumptuous armchair. We've been waiting for half an hour when preen crashed in skipped onto the stage and flung himself into the chair. He lit up a cigarillo and glared at us. A rustle of sniggering swept across the hut, as we've registered the extravagance of his Buffon. He did not stir. Five minutes elapsed until preen extinguished the butterfly is cigarillo in a milk bottle half filled with water, which he removed from his tote bag. Then noisily clearing his throat he spoke. You are all musicians, he said. And if her winter mark is to be believed, musicians have the highest caliber, matchless and your ability to tackle the most difficult works that the present day composer can throw at you. Is that correct? And a not one of us was able to speak for we were completely flummoxed by our new maestro's accent, it was impossible to do justice to it. on the radio, it was an unnerving mixture of Afrikaans, Norwegian and Jordy made more complex by low hissing noises, tongue wrenching, glottolog, and a sort of whooshing sound which preceded every seventh word. Eventually, we managed a collective mumble of diffident to send. Good, continued praying, very good. That being the case, he screeched, I have it in mind to lay down before you a challenge which my fellow conductors have to date shied away from. I intend to SAP the lifeblood from your veins. You will wish you'd never been an egg in my mom's womb, ha. You and I are going to astonish the world. We have two years. You may think in a long time, a child can learn to walk and talk in that time, but our task will be harder, infinitely harder. Go home, eat a nourishing meal, get a good night's sleep. For tomorrow, we embark upon the phlogiston variations.

Frank Key  18:29
Never a man to do things by halves. Lothar preen had obtained Winslow's original manuscript. laboriously he wrote out by hand multiple copies sufficient not only for each member of the ensemble, but also for the ancillary players he knew would be necessary for the accomplishment of his ear shattering design. This has led to some controversy over the true authorship of preens version, as Winslow herself had never made a recording of her work. And as the manuscript was burned to a cinder in the conflagration that destroyed preens house and killed preen himself in October 1969. A fire believed by some to have been an ill fated insurance scam. ignited by the now drug rattled an impoverished conductor himself. Only those present at the 1929 premiere still alive and in possession of gramophone players 30 years later are able to compare the two versions. To date, researchers have identified only four people who fit the bill, why not budgerigar enthusiast from Samarkand now resident in a mental institution and quite quite senile, to a Genovese antic worry struck deaf and dumb by a traumatic hiking accident in 1974. Three, a shambling alcoholic from Bradbury Whose memory is unimpaired? But who speaks only in gibberish. And for a bus conductor from ironically mackerels field, who was only six months old when his exiled White Russian parents dangled him on their knees at that historic concert. A team of regrettably feckless researchers paid a pittance by the low thought pre Appreciation Society, a seeking further candidates who may help settle this knotty problem. But as each year passes, the chances of success grow ever slider. Another area of contention surrounding the preen variations concerns the instrumentation. Winslow's full orchestras were paired down of necessity to the limitations of the 14 piece ensemble, brass band and Boys Choir were replaced by a hurdy gurdy and a specially trained cat with some electronic implants, most controversially, preen dispensed all together with the jumble of metallurgical laboratory equipment in producing in its place, a sonically dissimilar barnyard worth of farm implements to be played by an octet of hyperactive three year old hired from a nearby pediatric Institute. insurance premiums demanded by the children's parents were preposterously high, and the Ensemble's management board refused to pay them. preme had no money of his own. his salary was paid directly to an organized crime syndicate in Borneo, which was blackmailing him over his teenage involvement in a blood drenched enormity. But such was his obsession with the phlogiston variations that preen struck a macabre bargain with the parents. If he said, any of the infants would meet with even the tiniest accident, while rehearsing or performing upon the farm implements. He would slay his entire family. So get the members of the ensemble to unimaginable tortures, tear out his own beard hair by hair with a large pair of pliers and drown himself in a barrel of fish oil. He signed the statement to this effect had it witnessed by a priest a circuit judge and a high ranking military officer and distributed copies to each of the parents. Ah, but preen was a canny one. He also gave the names and addresses of the parents to the crime syndicate in Borneo, alleging that they were police spies ready at any moment to swoop armed with incontrovertible evidence of the syndicates malfeasance. For the time being, he said he could hold them off, but the first word from him they must dispatch murderous Cutlass wielding thugs from their HQ, and strike down the spies. Otherwise, their worldwide criminal empire would be snuffed out in an instant. As soon as the gang acknowledged receipt of his communique, print collected the tops in his van settled them into the hastily constructed nursery camera rehearsal room, and unleashed them upon the farm implements. His sister Hattie was installed as their cooter and she soon had them creating the most exquisite racket as they frolicked among the Kearns bindles beans, double rakes and golf pincers.

Frank Key  23:32
Another member of the priene family, the black godly uncle Todd was employed to convert an abandoned aircraft hangar into a recording studio. his appointment was dubious, he had neither the qualifications nor the skills to undertake such a task. preen harangued the management board into paying his uncle a ludicrous sum, all of which was promptly salted away into one of Todd's illicit adventures. Boldly, preen demanded further funding. He visited each member of the board in turn at dead of night, accompanied by a brutish myrmidon supplied by his uncle. Not surprisingly, more money was made available. This time it was used to finance a starch factory scam in North Africa. However, a third attempt to prize cash from the board proved unsuccessful. Using the same tactics as before preman his henchmen turned up at the house of the board's president at three o'clock on a bitterly cold February morning. They pounded on the door with practiced madness, and was startled to be set upon by a blood Christ starving Panther unleashed from its cleverly disguised layer on the roof. preen suffered lacerations of a head and chest and his Buffon was terribly disarranged but he was luckier than his accomplice who had an arm torn off and bore the imprint of razor sharp fangs in his forehead for the remainder of his wretched life. The board president stood smirking in the doorway wrapped in a tremendously stylish dressing gown, and told preen that his uncle Todd had been arrested late the previous evening, and was as they spoke by the being beaten up by the Dowty, Inspector kargh pan and his boys down at the police station. Oh, and if prayin wanted to build this gigantic recording studio, he would have to do the job himself, he would not receive another penny from the management board. chastened, the great conductor vowed that his plans will be realized. For the next two years he worked like a maniac rehearsing the ensemble by day and single handedly building the studio at night, fiddling about with complicated electronic bitty bombs in the cavernous interior of the hangar sweating in the heat, generated by a dozen industrial lanterns he had stolen from the site of important roadworks on the Ballista lane bypass. Eventually, on the sixth of March 1959, everything was ready. On that day. The hooting ensemble with auxiliary hurdy gurdy is cat and infant. Directed by Lothar preen played the phlogiston variations, recording their performance in a single take of nine hours and 47 minutes. There were no overdubs. What we can hear on these CDs is the music exactly as it was played. The grinding noise in the first movement, the Pikachu barrage of the second, the wistful harp and flatio lat melody, drowned out by the battering of farm implement, which begins the well loved scrofulous battalions section. It is all here. Paul James pill goes right after listening to this, you might as well go deaf. There is no other music I know of which builds a sound world so breathtaking. That absolutely everything else you ever hear will see paled charmless and flaccid even my own sex tech for strings dish Walker and Tannoy, a gargantuan 14 hour epic on which I have worked for 20 years, and which I brought to a resembling conclusion this morning, the very morning on which posty limped towards my front door bearing the phlogiston variations box set. That was about 12 hours ago. I've written this review in a sort of frenzy sitting at my escrow trois by pencil tearing across the paper at inhuman speed. The floor is littered with peanut shells, that as always, I've been trumping my way through hundreds of peanuts as an age to concentration.

Frank Key  27:47
In a few moments, I will shove these pages into an envelope addressed to my editor tricks and bid mini to trot off to catch the last post. I will sweep up the peanut shells. I will take a bath and print my Buffon. It's not quite a printing like extravagance, but I've nurtured it with care. I will pull myself in generous shot of 45% proof bestie or freak and recline upon my purple sofa. When my tumbler is drained and I've rented it out, Then, and only then will I venture into the garden. Armed with a petrol cannon a box of matches, I will place the manuscript with my sextet, on which the ink is not yet dry into my sturdy incinerator, douse it in petrol and drop in a lighted match. As the flames crackle, I will no doubt begin to sob, the tears running freely down my cheeks glowing in the heat of the Blaze. I will be destroying the work that has occupied me obsessed me for two decades. But now, having heard the phlogiston variations, I know in the deepest recesses of my soul in the core of my being that they have been wasted years.

Frank Key  29:07
So that was the floor just on variations now available in print as one of three stories in we were puny. They were vapid, go to the website. And I'll be back with some more recent material next week.
