And there will be further extract from this magnificent pamphlet later in the program. That program being hooting yard on the air with me, Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM live from London. I would sing to you of Tarleton of the elites of the balcony if I could. If I could sing I would. But how can I sing math crammed with pebbles penned in a pound the top of the tour. And what an irony that it was Tarleton, who bustled me hands, arms flapping, half blinding me with the glint of his shiny shiny epaulettes. I would have sang with him surely and without smirking. Cars past below as we climbed the tour, I would have waved to them to their drivers for help. If I thought help would come. My mind was a chaos. The higher we climbed the tinier, the cars appeared until they seemed like motes of dust. They put the pound at the top of the tour to discourage attempts to escape. As further discouragement, the fence was electrified. Tarleton had keys to the panel upon which a lever or knobs or whatever could be pulled or depressed or whatever, to cut off the circuit temporarily to allow the gate to be opened. He crammed my mouth with pebbles before he pushed me into the pound. I thought of the glutes and of cracker tower. Oh tarlton tarlton What became of the balcony you things were so different than fresh from your Messerschmidt, not a hint of the Gleeks eating a crab apple and suffering in silence. That was noble suffering. Even the crab Apple was Noble. Certainly your shiny shiny epaulettes gave you a noble cast. I wanted to fashion a laurel wreath for your brow. But there were no laurels, just the bare balcony and a VISTA of snow. Nor did I sing then, though I could have done I ought to have done I wish I had done. I would have sung Have you Talton and recorded it upon magnetic tape and had a platter made of it, and it would have shot to the top of the hit parade. It would have dislodged Russ Conway regrets regrets. Now there are pebbles in my mouth and I'm painting a pound and you have stomped away back down the tour. You will get into your car parked in a galley tiny as a mote of dust from appear and you will drive away or be driven away by your chauffeur, his own epaulettes less shiny shiny than yours, ignoble epaulettes and when you drive away Will you think of the glitz, the balcony, Talton? Or will your head be filled with flummery? The dog in the pound the dog in the pound on the tour is small and hairy and Oriental. It's yap curdles my blood. Well the pebbles had been crammed in my ears and not my mouth, or as well as for what difference it would make. The sun passes behind the cloud. The electrified fence hums I think not seeing of Talton of the Gleeks of the balcony and boodles yaps

I probably don't need to tell you that that was a second extract from further science book 20 by Norman Davis, which I think is probably my favorite book of all time. Now, I'm Next up on on hooting yard on the air this week and 40 years after it was written. We are going to we being me and Miss dimity cashew who's here to accompany me, we're going to do a performance of 1000 sorry, 10,000 nails in the coffin of imperialism by Cornelius Cardew. The slight variation on the actual score, which I might read to you afterwards, but I think we'll just get on and perform this piece written in 1971 by Cornelius car Drew 10,000 nails in the coffin of imperialist

Was cartoons $10,000 in the coffin of imperialism, slightly, slight variation on the actual score, which probably calls for far more people, and actually calls for nails to be hammered into blocks of wood. Whereas we were just banging things. And, yeah, so grand card you submitted the piece for publication in the magazine, Aspen. It was rejected by the editor, American composer Tom Johnson, for being just too out of keeping with the issue as a whole. how different the world might be 40 years later, if the piece had been published, all over the world. proletarians would have poured over the latest issue of Aspen in their millions seized on the revolutionary implications of card use score, and began the inevitable historical process of driving those 10,000 nails into the coffin of imperialism. That's ushering in a bright new Maoist utopia of political reeducation camps and mass famines where workers would machine gun bosses into bloody pets in the words of a parent in praise of cadres political mentor, hardeeville Baynes. Yeah,

talking of Maoists and communists and that kind of thing, according to J. Edgar Hoover, in his 1958 book, masters of deceit, farmers in the coalition is a typical title of the kind of mimeographed pamphlet issued to communist study groups in the United States during the 1950s. Written in a simple style, and slanted to the average reader. These publications were used in the slow and gradual process of indoctrination, that turned previously patriotic Americans into slavish devoteam of a godless ideology. farmers in the coalition is also the title of a pamphlet issued by old farmer frack last year. Shortly after Cameron and Clegg's son splattered appearance in the Downing Street garden to announce the formation of the coalition government. Though it is stettner rather than mimeographed a small yet important distinction. The Mad old farmers tract is doctrinaire and as sinister as any screed aimed at the memory of all brains of American fellow travelers half a century ago. Written in an incoherent style and slanted to the deranged reader. The 2010 edition of farmers in the coalition more Or more accurately be called cows in the Coalition for old farmer frac presents the case for a number of his bellows. herd to be granted senior positions in the new regime. at this critical juncture in our national story, he writes in one of his few coherent passages, nothing can be more important than that my cows are installed in the great offices of state from Home Secretary to Foreign Secretary from Postmaster General to keeper of the Privy purse. cynics and conspiracy theorists will suspect that the cows last empowered would be mere puppets put in place to further them nefarious if befuddled aims of old farmer frack himself. Not so he argues. Those who claim that the cows last empowered would be mere puppets put in place to further the nefarious his befuddle aims on myself harbor within my curdled black worm riddled heart could not be more wrong. He writes, Caligula who made his horse a console is a much misunderstood Roman Emperor, and one for whom I have a soft spot in my curdled black worm riddled heart. I will be proud to follow in his wake. I will do all in my power to make sure that my cow Binky is made Postmaster General. She will lick all the stamps in the land herself with a rough tongue and copious cow spittle. Then usual see real change of the kind these politicians are always prattling on about. old farmer frac is less forthcoming about the changes to be ushered in by his other cows in other ministries. But it hardly matters. In time honored fashion, the evil Tories and the hapless Liberal Democrats have crushed beneath their boots, the inspiring revolutionary Vanguard represented by the Mad old farmer and his bellowing cows. Undaunted, he's thrilled to be working on a new pamphlet entitled other farmers with other cows in other Coalition's a sweeping historical perspective.

Finally, this week, let us discuss as if our lives depended upon it stubbings of the tow. But wait a minute, how likely is it that our lives could ever depend upon a stabbing or stabbings of a toe or toes? There is I suppose the possibility that we might be arraigned before a firing squad blindfolded wearing a white shirt. It's top buttons undone, hand bound behind our back drawer dressing in revolutionary or a dentist defines and at the moment when the mustachioed capistan is about to give the order to fire. He stubbed his toe and instead shout out and the firing squad disconcerted lovers it rifles thus winning us a reprieve from death. I can immediately think of two problems with this scenario. First upon what nature of object likely to be encountered on a ground suitable for the assembly of a firing squad. Could the kapitan stub his toe sufficient to cause him to cry out? Give him that his toes would be encased in sturdy military boots? We might posit a block of iron inexplicably left lying around just where the capricon is standing. But why at the point of issuing the order to fire? What do you think to move his foot? And even if he did, what do you not notice the iron block or toe stubbings stabbings are accidental, and the accident here imagined is beyond the bounds of common sense. It's true that some men rise to the rank of Capitan, though they be fools or wet behind the ears or otherwise lacking in noose. But even so. A second objection is that having stubbed his toe and shouted out instead of fire and the firing squad having been disconcerted, the execution would be canceled entire rather than merely postponed. Indeed, it's probable that it would not be postponed for very long. A toe stubbing is by definition, a sharpened instant trauma. And though the toe may throb for a goodly length of time, the shock itself quickly passes on one has one wits about one within seconds. Thus, having unexpectedly said Ouch, the capital N if he is at all worth his capital, salt, well brush off the accident and proceed with his proper business, which in this circumstance is the order to the firing squad to bring about our destruction under a volley of bullets. A third problem has just occurred to me, which is that the firing squad 10 staff and ready to fire might well respond to any barked exclamation from their capital and not pause to discriminate between out Fire or indeed any other noise that issues from his mouth at that precise moment. The general point here is that the stubbing of the capital toe does not become a matter of life and death, because however we consider the situation or death is inevitable. Whether or not it is just in view of our revolution real irredentist credentials need not concern us here. But what about a wholly different circumstance where say we are a passenger aboard a locomotive tracking at high speed across a High Bridge and the engine driver in the necessarily confined space of his engine drivers cabin and the course and in the course of the necessary physical maneuvers of his engine drivers duties, stubs his toe on the kind of hard metal panel or protuberance inevitably present in such a cabinet the front of such a locomotive. Now, I am wholly unacquainted with the ins and outs of the engine drivers art, but it seems to me that in a situation such as the one described, there is a very real danger of the brief and temporary shock of a toe stubbing leading to much greater disaster. If we consider the capitaine again for a moment, we should note that he has but the one decision to make that are ordering the firing squad to shoot and is a leisure to choose the moment, he might pause to preen his epaulettes or to smoke a cigarette even to offer a last cigarette to us as we await death. But for the engine driver in control of a huge machine rattling at high speed across a High Bridge, there is no such opportunity for relaxation, he must be ever alert and the momentary loss of concentration entailed by the stubbing his toe could well lead to him losing control of the engine and the locomotive being derailed and plunging off the bridge to crash into the River Rapids far below, causing mayhem and destruction

and yes, death not only for himself, but for all the passengers aboard the locomotive. Even the strongest of swimmers among us are likely to be too seriously maimed by the fall and impact to be capable of safely reaching the riverbank in the unlikely event that the wild currents of the rapid did not dashes against jagged and treacherous rocks. It's fair to say then, that there are indeed circumstances where the stubbing of a toe can be a matter of life and death. Bear that in mind when next you prepare to go out of your house, as you consider which socks which boots best meet the possible perils of the day. And that is the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope particularly you've enjoyed the extract from further science book 20 by Norman Davis. They'll probably be some more of that next week because it's just genius, isn't it really. And thank you also to Miss dimity cashew for joining me on the epoch making performance of the Cornelius Qadri pays 10,000 nails in the coffin of imperialism. Well, there that's a nail in the coffin of hooting out on the air for this week. Bye bye
