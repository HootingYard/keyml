Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four f m. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I'm going to entertain you for roughly 27 and a half minutes or so, or maybe 28. And beginning with I'm going to read a quotation from Thomas de Quincey. This is from chapter 10 of literary reminiscences. And this is the Quincy on Wordsworth. To begin with his finger, Wordsworth was upon the whole not a well made man, his legs were pointedly condemned by all the female connoisseurs in legs that ever I heard lecture upon that topic, not that they were bad in any way which would force itself upon your notice. There was no absolute deformity about them. And undoubtedly, they had been serviceable legs beyond the average standard of human requisition. For I calculate upon good data, that with these identical legs, Wordsworth must have traversed a distance of 175 to 180,000 English miles, a mode of exertion, which to him stood in the stead of wine, spirits, and all other stimulants whatsoever to the animal spirits, to which he has been indebted for a life of unclouded happiness, and we for much of what is most excellent in his writings, but useful as they have proved themselves, the words worth the end legs were certainly not ornamental. And it was really a pity, as I agreed with a lady in thinking that he had not another pair of evening dress parties, when no boots lend their friendly aid to mask our imperfections from the eyes of female rigorous. The elegantes for Marham spec tree says a sculptor would certainly have disapproved of their contour. The Quincy seems to think that the wearing of boots can pull the wool over the eyes of female rigorous, but this was certainly not the case with marigold true indeed it was the boots Dobson crunched around in often caused acute even physical disgust. The out of print pamphleteer had a huge and unlikely collection of boots, including those of the Austrian Postal Service and the Nova scotian seabird tagging patrol. Unlike john Prescott, he usually managed to pair them up correctly. The Prescott's is john Prescott, the MP his inability to pair the shoes up correctly shoes or boots comes from a note in the recent memoir from Chris Mullin and P, a view from the foothills, which is a memoir, but it's in diary form. And one day, he writes prescot black mood is compounded by the fact that he's come to work this morning wearing unmatching shoes, we are permitted a brief giggle this towards the end of the meeting, and minion appears with a plastic bag containing an assortment of shoes.

Last week, I promised, promised you that I tell you about soft in the pan. So that's what I'm going to do. In an 1845 issue of the mysteries of London, g w. m. Reynolds, who later went on to found Reynolds news, which lasted I think into the 20th century late into the 20th century, anyway. And the mysteries of London GMGW M. Reynolds provided a useful list of the sorts of items available from unregulated street schools in the district of spittle fields in Bethnal Green, which he described as entire streets that are not but sinks of misery and vise dark courts fetid with puddles of black slimy water, alleys blocked up With heaps of filth and nosy ating with unwholesome odors, abodes of sorrow vise and destitution, vile streets, inhabited by the very lowest of the low, the most filthy of the squalid and the most profligate of the immoral. Had you been among the most filthy of the squalid? You could have taken your pick from stalls selling fish, fresh and fried oysters, sweet stuff, vegetables, fruit tree publications, sopping the pan shrimps and periwinkles hair combs baked potatoes, liver and lights curds and whey sheep's heads, Haddock's and red herrings. I, for one would be only too pleased to see sopping the pan on sale in our major supermarkets, even if it were pre packaged under their own brand. And he mentioned sopping the pan but not that almost identical item of Victorian cuisine slops in the pot. Each had its adherence it devote ease. There was a sort of tribal loyalty to one dish or the other so that brawls in taverns or dens of vise or out in the stinking streets might be occasioned by the wrong answer to the challenge. Are you a pot man or a panna? Victorian readers were so familiar with the rivalry between the two that it drives the plot of many novels of the era. In palyed, Ada the crippled Eris for example, the eponymous heroine is torn between her guardian, a slop in the pan man, and her suitor who favors slops in the pot. I haven't actually read the book myself, so I can't tell you how things work out. It's just one of a great pile of novels referred to in a majestic academic study of fictional swapon, slops from the Victorian era that I borrowed from the library, but had to take back because umpteen other borrowers had reserved it. I wish now i'd photocopied some of the more startling bits. On the face of it, one would think slops in the pot one out over slop in the pan every time. After all, with the former you're getting more than one kind of slop presented in a presumably ceramic pot, whereas the latter promises just a single slop still in the pan in which it was boiled. I suppose what we have here is an echo of the eternal battle between Cavaliers and Roundheads, headedness and Puritans. The Lucian foppish Victorian man about town, with his decisive cravat and gaudy cuffs would plump the multiple slops in a decorative pot. While the severe Hawk faced misery guts groaning under the weight of self imposed moral strictures, would deny Himself anything but a simple slop in a simple pan. If I still had my library book, I could read out to you it's summary of the plot of another novel, or rather part work. I can get in the belly of the immoral maniac husband, or the ruination of Captain Purvis in this piece of virtually unreadable Tosh, seemingly hundreds of characters whom we have difficulty keeping track of devour endless pots of slops, and pans of slop chapter after chapter in between taking part in scenes of unimaginable vise and degradation, not the least of which is the tying of a tin can to the tail of an orphaned puppy. So I don't write them like that anymore, for which perhaps we should be thankful.

Reynolds actually refers to salt in the pan not slop in the pan, so my mistaken recollection. 24 hours after typing up the original quotation clearly makes a nonsense of that entire piece. But I refuse to apologize my short term memory may be in as ruinous a state as Captain purposes domestic hearth. But I shall carry on regardless contemptuous of Brickbats and I have no doubt that I shall prevail in the end whenever an end may come. But the good news is that I managed to get hold of a second hand copy, third or fourth hand copy of pallys Either the crippled air is originally published in weekly parts between 1851 and 1854. So I'm gonna read you chapter one. The wind was howling across the desert to mold. It was an incredibly Howley wind, and they were almost unbelievably desolate Moore's such desolation has seldom been held upon by wild wind anywhere ever throughout the records of time since the unimaginably distant past when the Moore's weren't alluvial plain, across which roamed weird, primitive beasts. Once those beasts held here, now it was the wind ferocious and its onslaught upon the barren emptiness of the malls, barren and empty and desolate, but for a tiny, ramshackle, near dilapidated cottage hunched alongside the single faint path that stretched across the Moore's twisting and winding and leading none knew where it was in this vile British habitude. That pallid ADA, the crippled Eris eked out her sorrowful existence and sorrowful it was indeed, for pallid, Ada lived alone, safe for the company of her wisdom, uncle, and even more wisdom aren't both near blind and shriveled and filthy and irascible. to them. pallid, ADA was more drudge than nice, and she skied all day and all night, every day and every night with barely a moment's rest, without them showing a scrap of gratitude. Quite the opposite. In fact, pallid, ADA was spat upon and insulted and shouted at and had either her wisdom uncle or wisdom aren't had the strength, they would have beaten her with broom angles, and flung breakable household objects at her head. pallid aidas ghastly paler was due to a fundamental ignorance or at the very least misunderstanding of vitamins. She subsisted on slops in the pot and soft in the pan, and though from time to time, she went out onto the desert to malls foraging for vegetables, such foraging was always hopeless, there being no farms for many miles around the only green stuffs she might have a find where rotten things chucked out of passing carts, and few carts were ever seen lumbering along lumbering along the faint path across the malls, for the malls were horribly desolate, and wild winds howled. Lack of vitamins too, may have had something to do with pallid aiders be crippled meant the precise nature of which would bring tears to the eyes of the most hard hearted listener for crushes, the poor pallid creature had only a couple of bits of worm eaten timber salvaged from the wreck of the ship, upon which he had been a passenger, and from which he had been hurled into the pitiless sea, many moons ago. The ship was sailing for a distant land of pomposity and riches when it was boarded by pirates from the Symbionese Liberation Army's maritime wing. They carried out acts of the most gross moral degeneration among both passengers and crew, before scuppering the ship on our rocky at all.

clinging to the two pieces of timber upon which now she hobbled about the semi dilapidated cottage on the More's, pallid Ada monstrously violated and newly be crippled, drifted in the broiling sea for weeks and weeks before being washed up on the shingle have a foul tempestuous stretch of coastline soaked in seawater, exhausted vitamin deficient and with the palette of curd, the half dead girl was found by a kindly krisztian gentleman, who was roaming the strand collecting geological specimens in a little bag. He took her to his coastal Manse and fed her on broth, and gradually she recovered her wits, or she lay on a sofa in his conservatory surrounded by tweeting budgerigars in birdcages. In the evenings, the Christian gentleman sat with her reciting improving passages from the Old Testament. pallid aidas palla grew less and the first faint flush of health appeared on her cheeks. Eventually, she grew strong enough to begin dragging herself around the conservatory on her makeshift crutches. And before long, the whole lower floor of the Manse was hers to explore. Now, she ate her broth in the dining room where linnets sang in bird cages, and there was a cabinet of interesting geological specimens to look at. The kindly gentleman was often out traipsing up and down the beach, gathering additions to his collection. And when he was home, he rarely spoke except when reading from his big leather bound Bible, but pallid, Ada felt safe and secure. And as her own troubles faded, she became aware that often her Christy and rescuers brow is furrowed, and his posture stooped, and his fingernails Nord to the quick, as if he were careworn, crushed, perhaps by the weight of an awful family secret. He does not divulge to his palate crippled houseguest. Had palate Ada not been such an innocent. She may have intuited, that the gentleman's clouded countenance was connected in some ways to the thumping and scraping noises she had begun to notice, which set the ground floor ceilings all a tremor. If it happened, that the gentleman was with her, reading his Bible, or munching on a celery stickers his frugal luncheon, when the noises from above shattered the peace and drowned out the tweeting of the cage birds, he would rise from his chair and excuse himself, and she would hear him clump up the stairs, and shortly afterwards, the thumps and scrapes would cease. It was to be many months before pallid, Ada learned their cause and origin. But one dreadful day her Edell ended. She was reclining on the sofa, fashioning a pin cushion out of a couple of old rags and a handful of Kpop one of a sudden a panting hobble the hoist scampered in from without pallid, Ada recognized him as the trustworthy local urchin who was employed to carry messages between the man's and the village. scarce abled to draw breath, the boy told pallid Ada of the calamity that had befallen her benefactor. The kindly krisztian gentleman had been collecting seashells at a deserted part of the beach, when a hideous aquatic monster reared up from beneath the waves and grasp 10 minutes savage lobsters and claws. He had time to cry out for the mercy of God, before the monster, flailing and thrashing, dragged him into the sea, and plunged with him into the cold black depth.

No sooner had the urchin imparted his terrible news than the thumping and scraping sounded from above, without the kindly gentleman present, to climb the stairs and to make it cease. howsoever he did so the mysterious noise continued and grew louder and louder until poor pallid, Ada covered her dainty is in fright. And then, with a mighty crash, the ceiling stopped shaking, and the noise did stop, only to be replaced by an even more menacing sound of something descending the staircase. pallid, ADA was transfixed with terror and her cheeks, which had so recently had a healthy rosy bloom, were once again bleached to a deathly pallor. Then, into the conservatory lumbered a misshapen wrench with filthy, matted locks straggling down almost to his huge, ungainly feet. He was dressed in noise, some rags, and his eyes were those of an unhinged maniac. Cripes, cried the Hubble, Leroy Tisch, the kindly old gentleman's weak brained brother, who has not been seen in this parish since before I was born, pallid, Ada swooned. When she awoke, the pallid cripple found herself bound hand and foot on the back of a cart. She could tell from its jiggery jugglery bumpity progress that she was traveling along, pitted rotted rustic lanes pulled by exhausted horses. She wondered who it was who was in the cab, shouting his head off in guttural gibberish and repeatedly striking the miserable Steve with a whip, the listener will not take too long to guess that it was the kindly Christine's maniac brother. But what may surprise any but the most astute is the knowledge that this vile abductor was merely following the command of pallid aiders wyzant uncle and wisdom armed ever since the yet uncoupled girl had set out on her journey from mistress pill beams Academy for naive young virgins to voyage across the seas and claim her inheritance. Her dastardly ancient relatives had been plotting to have her waylaid and brought to their ramshackle cottage, battered by howling winds out on the desolate malls, there to be enslaved as they're drudge working her fingers to the bone and fed on slops in the pot and soft in the pan. Oh, how they cursed as their evil plans went or Kim cam with the intervention of the kindly Christian gentleman, and then have a cackled with fiendish Glee as their eldritch powers gained strength and their spirit communications with the man's trapped maniac bore fruit. And what an evil fruit it was, as kanko rotten rotten, as the innards of the apple, with which the serpent tempted Eve. So it was that palyed ada, the crippled heiress was brought to the cottage, where we found her at the beginning of this Chronicle. Alas, she has much yet to suffer before our tail is done.

So from a I suppose the modern equivalent of a Victorian Penny Dreadful is a television show now really, isn't it? And it's not quite a Penny Dreadful. But I've long been a devoted fan of the ludicrous yet brilliant television series lost. This surprises some listeners, not least because it's of course a lost is a blatant plagiarism of the hooting yards cereal story. Blodgett and his pals hanging around on a mysterious island after surviving a plane crash episodes of which appeared on the website back in December 2005 in January 2006. But I forgive the writers and producers of the American TV series, because I am like as unto a saint and martyr. One of the features of the show that's always appealed to me, is the manner in which certain characters are named after great thinkers of the past. Rousseau, john Locke, Jeremy Bentham and Mikhail bacuna in all appear in the last script, and there may be others I've forgotten for the moment. Early on, I assumed the significance of these doublings would become apparent, until it last it dawned on me that they are though deliberately chosen purely arbitrary. A program such as the last encourages fervent babbling online fora and discussion groups where Airheads expand and exchange their theories about this or that clump of min UTI and clearly these names are planted. Like the books characters are seen reading throughout the series as fodder for the nutters. I also add that despite my enthusiasm for the show, I do not waste precious hours reading or contributing to the online drivel. Anyway, the point of noting This is that it's only belatedly occurred to me what a tremendous fictional device it is. unblinded to write stories featuring protagonists called Charles Lindbergh, or john Ruskin or Tallulah Bankhead or Hazel Blears, where no references remotely intended to their famous living or dead or brain dead counterparts. So you can expect passages such as the one I'm about to read out to you to turn up at hooting yard fairly soon. So Ringo Starr, you continue to define me. Excuse me. Start that passage again. Obviously the accent through meal. So Ringo Starr, you continue to defy me hist evil Nazi overgrip infura blind jack of Knaresborough to his kweilyn captive. Suddenly, a rescue party led by daring trio Nova Pilbeam IV competent Burnett and Thomas de Quincey crashed into the chamber. That Nazi hellhound spawn on his heels, but was swiftly grappled to the floor by David Miliband. Later, as the gung ho heroes sat in the helicopter taking them back to Blighty, they were moved to receive congratulatory radio messages from both Richard Milhouse Nixon and Ayn Rand, or perhaps Ed Miliband.

To end this weak shot, a couple of brief brief items. I'm just going to have a quick sip of tea. When you go to a sales it's highly likely that at some point, jets of Ecto plasmic goo will spurt around the room and startle you. It's important in these circumstances to maintain your insouciance instead of waving your arms around and shrieking. Go and lean against the mantelpiece and regard the scene with an air of amused nonchalance as if you're an actor in a 1930s drawing room comedy. If you smoke a pipe, this is the perfect time to light it. The echo plasmic goo will soon disperse or even vanish entirely, and your fellow sailor sees cowering and trembling, will be mightily impressed by your unruffled elegance. Then, as they recover their which with an air of embarrassment. You may intone a litany of awful dread in a booming voice from beyond the grave. expose the horns upon your head hidden until now by your tremendous Buffon. Snap your fingers and consign your charms to the fiery flaming pit.

Yes, anyway, and finally this week, there's a new film out. Revenge of the pig is a new film by Horst gak horse gak remember, is an idle light, easily deceitful and proud fellow who whispers insulting jest basically and obscenely and is rightly called by the people by the name of mimis. Revenge of the pig is a greasy, sad piece of cinema. Many gelatin plates were used in its production. It comes out in October, you will do well to make a note of that and to carry the note in the lining of your hat through the coming months. Memphis has made a film and the world will want to see it Horst gak now now. Now he is on a boat and the boat is at sea. The boat is golden. It has sales sail away members sail away and we will watch your magic lantern show in due time. And we will have pliers in our hands and we will pull with them. We will pull

that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. I'm off home too. quickly write a post for the hooting yard website. News has come in about a little several in the mystic badger. So there's something for you all to look forward to. And so I'll be back next week. Bye bye
