Good evening. Welcome to hooting yard on the air. We haven't got any music yet, but we're going to have some music later during a little break in the show. My name is Frank Hickey. Last week, I read the first part of Danny Blanche Fowler, a life in football. And I'm going to continue with that this week. I hope I may have time to finish the story on may not it may continue beyond this week. Last week, we had an introduction to the rules of football and some account of Danny blanch Fowler's early life when he went to the ink factory College, where a teacher taught him the rules of football, and he became quite skilled at the game. We ended last week with what happened next was completely unexpected. On the 15th of November 1928. Just after duck pond break, Danny Blanche Fowler was abducted by bandits. And so now we move on with Danny Blanchflower, a life in football. hooting yard had been plagued by robbers, vagabonds, and bandits for many years, the collapse of the hot air balloon industry, the decline of beekeeping, and the sorry state of tap water have all been put forward as reasons for the marked increase in villainy during this period. My own theory is more compelling, but I cannot do it justice here. Blanche Fowler was no stranger to banditry. On more than one occasion, a gang of Cutlass wielding psychopaths had attempted to plunder the college pantry, only to be beaten off by glob and his pupils brandishing a formidable array of kitchen utensils. On the 15th of November, however, a more deadly band attacked the ink factory. There were 25 of them, and they laid waste the factory and its grounds in an orgy of destruction, pillage and mayhem. glob himself was wounded a swac to his skull by a flying beetle canister, knocking him unconscious and later requiring 18 stitches. Blanche Fowler was taken by the mob because they had none among a number whose name began with B by abducting him and increasing their number to 26. They completed the alphabet and realize the ambition of their leader. The ferocious and demented Wenceslas AK. x brigands were known as the pencil sharpener gang, and they were probably the most feared troop of bandits active in Hoon at that time. Their speciality was to unleash a flock of starving owls at the scene of the crime and relying on the consequent disorder and panic and nip any resistance in the bad to make off with as much booty as they could carry back to their lair. Act trained each of his bandits to sniff out stationery and graphic equipment with inexplicable speed. It was said that his most valued gang member Nutter would sit in on talent on could spot a protractor at 200 yards and have it nestling safely cushioned in his knapsack within 30 seconds. The raid on the ink factory college followed the standard procedure. At half past eight in the morning, all the pupils were bent over their slates straining to hear Glub expound his lecture on turpentine. Suddenly, upwards of five dozen starving owls flew into the tent, throwing the class into confusion and uproar. Before they knew what had hit them. The Peoples had had their slates and chalks snatched from them, and Glub himself had been deprived of his compass set square fountain pen, ink bottle and crayons. For good measure. The bandits also took the grandfather clock and a box of wheat husks. hastily consulting the class register act noted the existence of a pupil whose name began with B and shoving the terrified Blanche Fowler into the roomy pouch of his smoke, cackled hideously, and with his gang in tow, swept out of the tent across the duck pond over the enormous wall and off across the sisal strewn fields taize headquarters, a stinking cave hidden in the mountains 10 miles to the south of hooting yard. before they left for good However, they laid waste etc. As described quite adequately just earlier.

Blanche Fowler's position was made quite clear to him either he joined the gang and underwent rigorous training course in stationary theft, or ACC and his cohorts would put him to an unspeakably grisly death. He chose the former. Remember that the child was only 12 before you pass judgment on him. under the tutelage of Magilton dweb Blanche Fowler soon learned the tricks of the pilfers art, and for the next six years, he accompanied the bandits on all their fearsome exploits. Kamba rent in his book, act and mud has provided a far more thoroughgoing history of this period in bland Fowler's life, then I am capable of writing. As I crouch here in the damp overgrown grass of the pet cemetery, my writing tablet resting on the tomb of my sadly departed seahorse, Biddy, it is more than I can bear to retail with dark period in Blanche Fowler's life added to which I'm running a high temperature, I sneeze incessantly, the rain is pouring down. I have no money to pay my gas bill. My cuffs are frayed. My dental condition is piteous. My neighbors have developed a religious mania. The bus conductor spits at me and I'm worried sick sick. I tell you about postage stamps. Oh my god, I sound like many Blanche Fowler, wind, wind wind. Please ignore what I just said. Why should you care that my seahorse is dead. It was only a seahorse. I must get a grip. Danny Blanchflower his career as a bandit came to an end in the summer of 1934. for reasons that are not entirely clear, Wenceslas act lost faith in the fully alphabetic composition of his gang, preferring instead to have it inside only those whose surnames began with vowels. dweb Blanche Fowler, even the criminal genius Syrian lantana known were expelled from the cave and left to fend for themselves. so heartless was act that even confiscated the souvenir pencil cases, which is accomplished under bath had presented to the outcasts. Although they had formed a majority of the gang, the 21 bandits lacked a natural leader, and after a few pathetic attempted robbery, pillage and questionable behavior, they soon went their separate ways. not been quibbling. yig signed on with a pirate ship.

Easy peasy, listener. Stop listening for a while and pronounce determinedly to your nearest Public Library, scan the shelves for books on sorry that was illegible and come back to me when you've devoured every word of them. This will at least give me the opportunity to for a well earned rest from my labors.

Now that you will fully conversant with the history, geography, socio economic infrastructure, flora, fauna, geology, currency, major buildings and tourist attractions of Madagascar, you can well imagine young Danny Blanchflower, still only 18 disembarking from a catamaran at the port of Tama tab and finding himself a bed for the night in a rundown shack infested with a hideous array of creepy crawlies. You can see him next morning, rubbing the sleep from his eyes clutching his tote bag, capturing the train and tandem rivo boning up on his mulberry documents during the 229 mile journey, and late in the afternoon, presenting himself to AWS bound Hummingbird overseer of the mulberry works. It is in this building an astonishing piece of architecture as you will no doubt be aware, having read lapwings monograph that Blanche Fowler will spend the next three years of his life living in a tiny cubicle wedged in a nook between the crushers and working his way steadily upwards in the works hierarchy. How speedy was his rise, how he devoted himself body and soul to his duties. No sooner had he done the unusually splattered uniform of a churn monitor, then he discarded it for the equally peculiar costume sported by the assistant sellotape inspectors. Not long afterwards, having been promoted to senior sellotape Inspector, and by now in daily contact with hair Hummingbird, he reached the pinnacle of his mulberry in Korea, when he was appointed to the position of deputy chief interrogation attendant in the office of the overseer himself. Like Button glue before him and lip no to afterwards, AWS bound Hummingbird was impressed by some indefatigable sync, sorry, indefinable singularity in his protegees character. Unfortunately, no one has ever been able to translate the memoir he wrote a blonde fella composed it is of illegible mulberry stained scribblings in a language which may or may not be Hungarian. Hummingbird is a vastly interesting character whose participation in the more alarming episodes of recent Madagascan history deserves to be set out in a separate work. As soon as I've got Blanche Fowler off my hands, I'll turn my attention to it. Be patient. So we have arrived in reasonably good spirits, I hope at the autumn of 1937. On the eighth of October, a rusty ship docks at tamma Tav. Hundreds of Madagascans are crowded onto the key side, and as the passengers begin to disembark, a huge cheer goes up. hats are thrown into the air. toxins are wrong. Wooden rattles are rattled. Outside the stevedores heart and maypole has been erected. Dozens of tents, stores and kiosks have been set up. There is a fair ground atmosphere be the Eid vendors Hawk their wares, snaking through the eager crowds selling a Rama agglomeration of souvenirs, trifles and baubles. The cause for all these festivities, is that the frisky tourists skipping off the ship of the players, coaches and officials of Red Star Hoon, the finest amateur football team of its day. Yes, little ones. There was a time when teams of amateurs fired by an enthusiasm bordering on derangement traveled the known world playing football for no other reason than that they adored the game, picking matches with the first 31 volunteers to come forward, accepting the hospitality of their hosts Be it luxurious or foul. Amateur teams were engaged in the kind of Crusade, the like of which has sadly disappeared in the present dispensation.

By the time they arrived in Madagascar, Red Star who'd were in the 11th year of a permanent World Tour, many of the original team had perished along the way, buried under landslides in Java, electrocuted in j wick drowned in a Finnish Maelstrom, or blown away by freakish hurricanes in Batavia. Fresh players would join the squad shipping out from Hulu at regular intervals to make up the numbers. And you cake was drew to join the team in Madagascar. At 54 Pugh winter Mark had recently had to end his professional career after a mishap with a winding sheet. redstar hoon requiring a cake following the accidental death of the previous incumbent impaled on a harpoon in Guatemala. Winter Mark headed for Africa in his aerostat hardly had his journey began that he was enveloped in that rare meteorological phenomenon, the Pope Pius the fourth effect, much has been written in the specialist journals about this bewildering concatenation of wind rain, cloud cover sunlight, pollen, helium, barometric pressure, electricity, combustible mugwort particles, sand McKenzie beams and Sapphire. In a famous experiment reported in the Journal of winter muck study Volume 47 number two limit attempted to isolate the cause of the deafening peewit noise, which is heard just before the effect enters its perilous last phase. Her methodology has been condemned by thing, among others, and it's doubtful if her work will have a lasting influence in the field. Winter mark, of course, was swept away and gone never to be seen again in this world or any other. And so, Danny Blanchflower stepped in proffering his services when Red Star Hoon came to the Capitol. In the years since his abduction by x bandits. Blanche, Fowler's interest in football had remained on deemed deprived of the opportunity to play the game. He has kept him Crim following a daily exercise routine which would leave most people exhausted and fit for the dustbin. parcels containing outlandish calisthenic operators were delivered regularly to his cubicle, their provenance obscure. The chief coach of Red Star Hoon, whose name I cannot tell you for legal reasons, gave the young mulberry worker at trial and was astonished at what she saw. interviewed many years later by Bagshaw, she declared that in his handling of the bayonets and icing sugar, Blanche Fowler was the most talented footballer she had ever seen. When told that he had not played for nine years, and until then only in torchlit games in the grounds of the ink factory, she assumed he was cutting her and many months would have passed before she finally accepted that the juggy had 21 year old was telling the truth. He appeared in his first proper game on the sap side against a motley team of Madagascan piano tutors, spivs bat trap builders and Jesuits redstar hoon. One Of course, with no little help from their new player whose dribbling skills alone were majestic. He was carried off the picture on the shoulders of his teammates, and immediately surrounded by fawning spectators, who would not let him go until he had autographed his satchel and donated it to the local biting group as a prize for their annual raffle. The triumph was short lived, however, the following morning, oz bow hummingbirds sought out blonde fella before dawn and demanded that he answer a question. What was it to be football or mulberries? Who, apart from me can imagine the young man's quandary without bursting into tears? Who, apart from me can picture the trappings of the chamber in which the interview took place? None of you can because you've not ruined your health researching this subject over many years, and I have fractures and military Hummingbird demanded an immediate reply. Nursing the broken jaw here to Spain in the sixth fret of the match. Blanche Fowler weighed up his options. A glittering career in the mulberry works stretch before him. Soon he knew he would be earning enough money to buy himself replacement toggles for his duffle coat. He'd been all but promised a slightly larger cubicle in the attic. The work itself

was fascinating, if senseless, was he just throw all this away to follow a raggle taggle band of amateur footballers as like traipse the globe. He was unable to sink straight, with hummingbirds standing there clutching a jar of Merv, which he threatened at any moment to hurt his employees head. Unable to speak coherently because of the jaw injury. Blonde Fowler signaled for pen and paper. Hummingbird handed him a pencil in the back of a railway map. his nerves blasted Blanche Fowler kept dropping the pencil onto the floor, thinking that he was playing for time hummingbirds through the merger of the young engrade. But his aim was hopelessly adrift and the jar sailed out of the window and landed in the street eight floors below where it would surely have injured a pedestrian had it not been remember before dawn, when the avenues and boulevards of this magnificent capitol city were deserted because of the curfew. retrieving the pencil from the floor for the umpteenth time, Blanche Fowler began to write his answer, but Scarcely had he started to form the first letter in his exquisite copperplate than the point of the pencil snapped. Shaking with fury Hummingbird woke half the building with his bellowed demands that someone fetch a pencil sharpener. Towel head flunkies still in their pajamas scurried from room to room in the gigantic mulberry works pulling open desk drawers rifling through escript was overturning shoe boxes filled with writing equipment, rooting through trolleys from the janitorial and scattering the contents of entire filing cabinets across car doors in their desperate attempts to do the Masters bidding. The search proving fruitless, one of the more ingenious flunkies cobbled together a makeshift pencil sharpener, using two pieces of wood, a copper spring and gutta percha batons sewn in heart sawn in half, a ball of sulfur and afraid rep rag. clambering nimbly up the ladder to the room wearing Hummingbird and Blanche Fowler sat in frosty silence, the flunky handed over his contraption, trembling with agitation Blanche Fowler made three or four cack handed attempts to sharpen the pencil before Hummingbird losing patience snatched the implement from him. In doing so, however, he arranged it so hard that the hastily assembled instrument came apart, falling in pieces to the floor. Hummingbird shrieked at the flunky to fix it, but his breath was wasted, for the man had already left the room indeed, was at that moment on his way out of the building, for he had an urgent errand to run for one of the potato adjutants and had 30 seconds to spare to catch the dorm bus to the other side of the city. apprised of this and on the brink of apoplexy, Hummingbird dispatched a fleet of motorcyclists to weigh lay the bus and bring back the flunky. Meanwhile, a gaggle of sycophantic records had made their way up to the chamber and were fighting with each other in their attempts to mend the pencil sharpener. Of course, this only made matters worse, and by the time the original flunky returned, the constituent parts of his gadget were ruined beyond repair, kicking the rectories out of the chamber through a trapdoor Hummingbird handed the pencil to the flunky, kicked him out to and commanded him to return with it. Julie sharpened in two minutes flat, or there was no knowing what violence would ensue. Somewhere in the crannies of the mulberry works, the flunky found the makings of a second improvised pencil sharpening mechanism and scurried up the ladder with the freshly sharpened pencil. Just before Hummingbird deadline expired. The flunky handed the pencil to Hummingbird. Hummingbird passed it to Blanche Fowler. Blonde Fowler took a deep breath and knowing that his future hinged on the word he was about to write on the back of the railway map, inscribe the word mulberries

as a reward for his loyalty, Blanche Fowler was immediately guaranteed the post of Superintendent of flasks and railings as soon as the present incumbent died, he was able to buy new toggles. He was given the promised cubicle several square centimeters larger than his previous one. Perhaps he lay awake at night agonizing that he'd made the wrong choice, damning himself for turning his back on a football career. Who can say it's not my business to speculate on Blanche Fowler's interior life, which will remain a closed book to us until he chooses to write an auto biography. Within weeks however, that future which looked so secure was in tatters. AWS battled Hummingbird took a leave of his senses. sacking his entire workforce. He called in a demolition squad and had them raised the mulberry works to the ground, converting his worldly assets into cash. He obliterated the whole lot by shoveling it in sackfuls into the largest furnace in Madagascar. He then set out for the Antarctic, where he was last heard of holed up in a weather station, chewing water biscuits and conversing with penguins. redstar hoon was still touring Madagascar, and Blanche Fowler decided to throw in his lot with them. In a sense, what remains of this His story is hardly worth the telling. From this point on most of the important details of Blanche Fowler's life have entered the public record. Indeed, his career is the stuff of modern day legend, an integral part of the contemporary mythos present in the consciousness of every human being now living. The footballing career itself is best set forth as a list of statistics, the sort of facts and figures which the young Blanche Fowler committed to memory with such zest reams and reams of paper could be filled with them in UTI of international hats, puncture rights, balls, hidden records broken and so on. It's a task the prospect of which frazzles my wits. To my relief, I've been informed that bird hole that drug drug druggies is currently work on the Danny Blanche Fowler encyclopedia, a comprehensive tabulation of over 20,000 particulars. Perhaps I shall read it on my deathbed. One might be forgiven for thinking that Blanche Fowler's personal life would provide more rewarding material, I must confess that I myself suffered from this misapprehension. That's why I agreed to write this essay in the first place. The publishers didn't have to hold a gun to my head first. By God, it makes me blush to think how keenly I embarked on my research, and how irksome has been my existence ever since. I've been jabbed in the ribs by plenty of revolvers in the past 11 years, terrifying brutes let loose by the publishers regularly beating a path to my door. A contract is a contract like grunt in menacing tones, never failing to shatter a vase or wrench adore from its hinges before they leave. Well, I'm done with it. Now. I've told you more than any sane person could wish to know about Danny Blanchflower. I've made strenuous efforts not to lie not at earning any respect for the truth, but on the simple basis, that if the publishers even suspected that I'd made any of this up, I'd receive another no debt conclusive visit from their thugs. In sticking to the truth, I've also tried to impart an air of enthusiasm for my subject, not quite breathless, I grant you but enthusiasm. Nevertheless, there has been dark days when the effort of doing so seemed insurmountable. I cannot count the times I've hold my pencil away from me and anguish and frustration, but always, always I've retrieved it and set back to work, knowing in my heart that the smallest show of disinterest or fatigue will be held against me. In a few moments, I'll at last be able to fling the pencil away for good. I've already purchased a small carton in which to place this manuscript, tucking it under my arm, I will try to cross the marshes to the upturned dingey in which the hooting yard press goes about its nefarious business. I expect the thugs will be loitering outside knuckled dusted fist thrust into their pockets, smoking cheap foreign cigarettes and spitting on the gravel. When if I'm allowed to enter, I will pick my way through the tenebrous interior and hand over my carton to the oily welt the bastards employers are Clark,

they will probably be papers to sign. I won't bother to read them. I know already that they'll bring me nothing but affliction and ruin. I'll make my escape as best I can. It's unlikely that I'll ever receive the agreed payment, a bag of boiled sweets, but nothing in this world is impossible.

Frank Key  28:26
So that was Danny Blanche Fowler, a life in football, which is an old malice aforethought press title, originally published in 1991. And there's only one copy remaining. If you'd like to buy it, send me an email. And I won't be here next week. There's special programming next week. But I'll be back in two weeks with more morally instructive prose for you. Bye bye.
