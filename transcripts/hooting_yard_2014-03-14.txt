A good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM, or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air, I should wake up should know how sound as if I'm half asleep. Now, earlier this week, I did a live live event. It was the first event of a kind of double act called taking nonsense for a walk. And the first half of the show is Roland Claire, giving an illustrated lecture on the history of literary nonsense. He doesn't really attempt to define it, because one of his definitions is that it's extremely difficult to say what's nonsense, and what isn't. But anyway, that's the first half. And then the second half is basically me, revealing some of my stuff. And we did this at a school. And there's a possibility that we might be asked to go to other schools and colleges, English departments, and so on. To repeat what was a very exciting show. Anyway, the reason I mentioned all this is because Roland produced for the, for the show, he produced a kind of souvenir program. I say souvenir programming fact is a it's a 64 page booklet, an anthology of literary nonsense. in chronological order, beginning with Jeffrey pure author, and ending with Mr. K. Anyway, during his talk, well hang on, as I say, Roland, was was saying that it's difficult to define nonsense, and that some things in the anthology might be nonsense, and might not. And one of the pieces in the anthology is an extract from the King James Bible of 1611. Luke chapter three paragraphs 23 to 38, where he gives a word, the genealogy of Jesus Christ. And in his talk, Roland, laid down a sort of challenge. I don't think he realized he was doing this at the time. But he laid down a challenge when he said he defies anyone to read this passage from the Bible without laughing. And I immediately thought, Well, okay, I'm gonna read it. The next opportunity I get on hooting out on the air. So that's what I'm going to begin the show with. Anyway, if you if you are a member of an English department in a school or college, and would like to spend not much money, we're pretty cheap. But if you'd like me and Roland to come and talk to you about nonsense, we will our fee plus expenses, be very welcome. Send me an email, you know where to hooting dot yard@gmail.com. Anyway, all via resonance. Anyway, so here Then, I will not laugh is from the King James Bible. We Authorized Version 1611. The Gospel of Luke Gospel according to Luke, chapter three verses, yes, chapter three verses 23 to 38. And Jesus Himself began to be about 30 years of age, being as was supposed, the son of Joseph, which was the son of heli, which was the son of math that which was the son of Levi which was the son of melki, which was the son of Jana, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of mythos. mattathias which was the son of a moss, which was the son of gnome, which was the son of Emily which was the son of naggy, which was the son of math, which was the sound of mattathias, which was the son of semi which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Gouda, which was the son of Joanna which was the son of Risa, which was the son of Zorro Bible, which was the son of Salafi L. Which was the son of nary,

Frank Key  05:03
which was the son of melki, which was the son of Addy, which was the son of CO Sam, which was the son of Elmo dam, which was the son of Earth, which was the son of Josie, which was the son of Eliza, which was the son of Jordan, which was the son of my fat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Gouda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Joe Nan, which was the son of Le Arkin, which was the son of Malaya, which was the son of men and which was the son of Matt atha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David, which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of obeyed, which was the son of booze, which was the son of salmon, which was the son of nasaan, which was the son of Amina dab, which was the son of Iran, which was the son of es ROM, which was the son of fairies, which was the son of Judah, which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of fara, which was the son of natural law, which was the son of serach, which was the son of raguel, which was the son of failback, which was the son of heavier, which was the son of Salah, which was the son of Canaan, which was the son of our facts ad, which was the Son of Sam, which was the son of Noah, which was the son of lantech, which was the son of Methuselah, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Mullah Leal, which was the son of Canaan, which was the son of he north, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

Frank Key  07:46
Now, there's a few problems with that we were just talking as the music was playing. The whole point, I thought of the Christian story, is that Jesus was not the son of calcif. He was a virgin birth, who is the son of directly the Son of God. So how does that work? JOHN? Any ideas? Um, well,

Unknown Speaker  08:12
when I gave it what it did start with Joseph, yes. Right. So not with Matt. They didn't go there. Mary's line? No. I think well, I thought Oh, geez. carried on the Jewish line via the the female mother. Oh, no. Today, but still, yes. That did start with Joseph. So yes, it's kind of um, yeah, but it's a metaphor. Anyway, the whole thing is a metaphor. Okay, saying everyone is a son of God. Right. Okay. The Bible is metaphorical stories are not literal. Like Americans would like.

Frank Key  08:55
I was like to be able to trace my lineage back to Asgard.

Frank Key  09:00
And to God. Anyway, on with the show. I hope you enjoyed that. And if you were counting the generations, please ring in and let us know how many there were because john, and I was just wondering about that.

Unknown Speaker  09:14
Yes, it sounds. Well, it sounded like it was more than 4000 years, which is how old the earth is supposed to be called into. Big shape. People you don't believe in science,

Frank Key  10:06
I agree with you entirely or radio.

Frank Key  10:40
Right on with the show. Roland Claire, who I mentioned who was my co star, if star is the word for either of us in the talk is also the editor and wrote an introduction to by aerostat hooting yard, which is the definitive ebook compilation of my writing. I have mentioned it before, but I might as well give it another plug, you can buy online, go to the hooting yard website, and you say a picture of the cover. And it's incredibly cheap, it's about four quid or something. And if it were a book, you know, like a real book made of paper, it would probably be about 500 pages. And so it's incredibly cheap and you get 147 stories, plus a scholarly introduction by Roland. And anyway, as part of the plugging of that ebook, I'm going to read something from it now. This is a talk on Dobson. I've been speculating of light on how Dobson would have fared in the age of blogging. The common view is that the great pamphleteer would have flourished in this medium. But I wonder if that's true. He would not of course be out of print as it is so regrettably the case and I suppose most of us feel a Pang when we imagine how tremendous it would be to log on to our computers to find fresh blog posts from so fecund a writer, and how piquant it would be to be able to add our own comments to whatever he had to say for himself on any particular day, rather than as we must do, simply scribbling private marginalia in the few battered and dogeared pamphlets. We may have managed to scavenge from drunk shops and rummage sales and community hub bazaars and compost heat. Yet, the more I think about it, the more I remain unconvinced that Dobson would have taken to blogging as effortlessly as a swan to a pond. The reasons for my hesitancy are three fold. As I'm sure you are aware, dealing with three fold all in one go can cause nervous over excitement and lead to the vapors and the dangles. So I'm not going to talk about the first two folds. The third fold, however, is something I feel sufficiently robust to attend to this evening. As it happens a few weeks ago, I was asked to give a talk on Dobson to the inmates of a crucifix school. It was an outdoor event, taking place in a field joining the main block, a building with a base and British skirt. Fortunately, the weather held and we were not rained upon as I had feared might be the case earlier in the day, when I had become distracted and missed the prognostications of Mr. Daniel Corbett, the eminent weather forecaster. Usually on these occasions, I'd like to pick my own topic, whether it be Dobson clunking noises or Dobson's use of novelty pipe cleaners, or the textual implications of Dobson's fear of squirrels. Sometimes I make my choice based on what I think will appeal to any given audience. Sometimes I act on mere whim. And sometimes I just blather but this time, I had been asked to address the specific question. If Dobson were alive today, would he be a blogger? Or would he continue to turn out pamphlets? It was a rather unwieldy title for a talk, but I accepted the invitation, not least because it came from an enduring flibbertigibbet. I speak of the province or state of the crucifix school mod sprain for who In my youth, I want to carry to talk. Arriving at the field having been booted from a shower bank, I was somewhat upset to find that mod was not there to welcome me. In fact, so shredded where my nerves that I left had a great cry of grief. I was hurried into a tent by some sort of aid to camp, who gave me a reviving brain tonic and explained that Maude had been called away to an important meeting. Apparently, there was a to do about the crucifix schools preferred biscuit supplier with Huntley and Palmers and peek friend locked in on Holy Kombat.

Frank Key  15:44
mod had gone to poly with representatives as the two Titanic biscuit makers. Although I have to say that from my memories of her, I did not think it was a role to which she was suited, as well as being a flibbertigibbet. She was given to going do Lally and throwing breakable items such as drugs against walls. I wondered if the biscuit people had been warned. Having swallowed my second helping of brain tonic, I was led by the aide to camp back out of the tent and across the field to where my audience of Sparky tinies was waiting. It was a terrific field. Apart from modern grass, it was rife with fields bind weed convolvulus arvensis with it pink and white flowers with wayfaring trees, viburnum lantana deciduous shrubs, not trees, despite the name close to wild gelda all red and black berries with common or red leg per se carrier polygonum persicaria. A weed with blotches on its leaves, allied to the distorts, and with ladies smock cardamine pratensis or white or lilac flower, often found in damp meadows and fields such as this. Those at least were the four plants I was able to identify before I was bundled numb to gently down into a ditch and from there into the subterranean tunnel. Most tunnels are subterranean, of course, it goes with the territory, but I'm using the words of the aide de camp, who actually shoved me in the small of my back hissed, come come, we must enter this subterranean tunnel. I was perplexed for as far as I was aware, the pupils eagerly awaiting my Dobson lecture, was sitting on a tarpaulin in the field above. Equally perplexing was to see that the tunnel was lit by lanterns dangling from hooks hammered into its ceiling, and that interspersed with the lanterns, dangle bird cages, in which perched blind thrushes and sparrows. I stuck my heel into the muck and the foot and rounded upon the aide de camp demanding an explanation. This is where we bring the blind birds she said. I accepted that at face value, and he persuaded me to continue ahead until we reached a cavernous underground storage facility. It was enormous and chilly. I do not think I've ever seen so many packets of biscuits stacked so neatly in one place. There were piles and piles and piles and piles and piles of them, creating a narrow passageway in the center. I noted that to one side, all the biscuits were hungry and farmers and to the other. They were peak friends. You may pick a packet as your payment announced the aide de camp. Now, more than I had not discussed my reimbursement for talking to the tinies about Dobson and blogging. There are some people there even I regret to say some Dobson, who insist upon cash when delivering talks upon the great out of print pamphleteer. Naturally I'm not averse to a fistful of readies, but it seems to me that spreading the word about Dobson is too urgent and activity to depend necessarily upon the receipt of grubby banknotes. So that's it is that in the past, I've actually accepted payment in various kinds, including a plastic siphon, a project stuffed with the hair of a hand criminal, a torn besmirched copy of old cat heads Almanac, a share in the ownership of a lame pig, several towels and rags, glue pips, lemon curd, I picture postcard from ins mouth and a Cake fork. You might think then that I would happily snatch your packet of biscuits from this vast underground pantry and return to the surface ready and willing to give my talk. On any other day I may well have done so. But now I was overcome with pangs of pity for the blind birds in cages dangling from hooks in the tunnel. So I told the aid the camp, that I would forego my Huntley and Palmers or peak friends, and instead wanted her to release the thrashes and sparrows, and to return them to the blue overarching firmament.

Frank Key  20:41
She looked at me as if I were bonkers, and explained that being blind, the birds would surely be savaged by other bigger predatory birds, such as hawks and vultures, and modern pterodactyls within minutes of being allowed to flap away into the sky. This sounded like a pretty cogent argument, but I questioned her about the so called modern parrot modern pterodactyls birds I've not heard of before, and once I felt sure she had made up on the spur of the moment, as a way of persuading me to take a packet of biscuits as more originally intended. The aid can tell me something new to me that the British actor Richard Attenborough, ruled as a potentate over a remote island where he read modern pterodactyls, and other primeval beasts. And should any of the blind thrushes or sparrows managed to get back far before being pecked to pieces by hawks or vultures? They would surely come a Cropper in the fifth razor sharp talents of one or more have written Richard Attenborough's avian brood. I happen to have the numeric protocol coordinates for the aged thespian embedded in my portable metal Tapping Machine and considered directing a transmission requesting confirmation of this startling yet somehow credible information from him until I record that mod sprain and deliberately cited her crucifix school in a so called metal Tapping Machine muscleman zone. She could be such a caution. I was left with no alternative but to accept graciously that the savagery of nature outweighed my sentimental impulses, and I plumped for a packet of peek friends bite size, OT chalk mozzie pan water biscuits. As we made our way back along the tunnel, the aide de camp pointed out to me the gleaming tungsten piping system through which bird seed and nutritionally enhanced water was supplied to the blind birds. I felt reassured. For some reason I could not fathom the tunnels exit opened upon a different part of the ditch from where we had entered. As we emerged, I saw that in order to get back to the surface, we would have to fight our way through a tangle of gooseberries, goosegrass and goosefoot. The gooseberry is a low spiny bush with globular green fruits. goosegrass, also known as cleavers, is a close relative of bed straws, which struggles over vegetation clinging to it and clothing at clean to it and to clothing. With the tiny prickles on it stems, leaves and fruits. goosefoot is a genus of weeds with tiny green flowers in leafy or leafless spike, the communists being fat hen, red goosefoot, which often has reddish leaves, many seeded goosefoot and good King Henry the ditch though was entangled with stinking goosefoot, which smells repulsively of stale fish. Earlier when I told you about the field bind weed, the wayfaring trees, the purse the carrier and the lady's smock in the field. I gave you the Latin names, but time presses on. So if you want to know the Latin for the gooseberry and goosegrass and goosefoot, you'll have to look them up yourself. I recommend a reference work such as the penguin Dictionary of British natural history by Richard and Maisie fitter 1967 as well as telling you about plants named after geese. This invaluable book is packed with hundreds of entries on birds, butterflies, fish, flowers, funghi, insect moth, reptiles and trees. It even tells you the difference between a stone and a weasel if that's the kind of thing you need to know. The tinies were sat upon their tarpaulin awaiting my talk but getting to than was clearly going to be a struggle. According to the bells clanging from the old bell tower. I was due to speak in five minutes time. The aide de camp was fossicking in her Pipi bag, so I asked asked her what she was looking for. one of two things she said either assented Minh and rectangle to hold over my nose to counter the overwhelming stench of stale fish or a big sharp slicing implement a sharp as the talents of one of Richard Attenborough's modern pterodactyls, with which to slight and huge through these plants named after the geese. I'm sure I must have one or other in my Pipi bag, if not both.

Frank Key  25:42
I could see why mod had made so resourceful a woman at the camp and wondered what else might lurk in the Pipi bag, but I was far too polite to ask. I drummed my fingertips against my temples as the rummaging continued, conscious that time was ticking away on the clock on the old belltower, and that we were in grave danger of being late for the Chinese mod had stipulated that I had to begin my talk on time, for only by doing so could I had to create the strange gods who loomed over the crucifix skull, always quick to anger, and in that anger to smite the building and blast it to ruin much good would my packet of peak friends do me if I allow the cataclysm to occur? Like the weeds choking the ditch, the looming Gods will do squads aggressive web, the foot and with feathers of whitish hue, differing from mortal geese in that they were doubly aggressive, doubly web doubly wide of immense size and spectral. I watched them now looming with menace over the school ready to strike to be a suede Dhoni by my talk to the Chinese on the tarpaulin and still, the aide to camp was scrambling in her Pipi bag like a badger in Bracken. There was gas 40 seconds to go when she shriek to triumphant cry, slapped a scented linen rectangle over her nose and sliced at the gooseberry goosegrass and goosefoot with a big sharp slider. And with one bound we jumped free of the ditch and tilted towards the tinies a second a day camp have given each of them a tumbler of purple pop and a radish to keep them quiet. So I was met with absolute silence as I took my place on the speaking mat. I glanced up and allowed myself a small wrinkly smile as I saw the goose God's flock away into the ether. And then I kept my fingertips upon my calf and cleared my throat. Greetings tinies I boomed my spine straighten my Buffon unruffled. I'm here today to talk about the topic of Dobson were alive today. Would he be a blogger? Or would he continue to churn out pamphlets? I'm sure some of you think you know the answer. Well, I've thought long and hard about this question. And my conclusion may surprise you. You see, I don't think Dobson would ever have become a blogger. for one simple reason. bloggers type on computer keyboard, but Dobson always wrote in a little notepad with a pencil. I rest my case. And that in a nutshell, is the essence of the third fold in my three fold argument. If you are avid for the details of the first and second fold, I may be tempted to tell but only if you send me some biscuits. I leave it up to you. Whether you send Huntley and Palmers or peak friends. And that's the end of this week's episode of hooting out on the air. Bye bye.
