Yahoo Sita This is Frank key with tonight's episode of hooting yd on the air yahveh, who Sita is the greeting used for the space people in the star fellowship formed in the early 1960s. by Tony wed of chiddingstone. Those of you with long memories may recall. God knows when it was a couple of years ago or more, I devoted part of a show to possibly the most fantastic prose that has ever been read on this program. I'm sad to say not by me, cosmic friends, a pamphlet by Jimmy Goddard. And this is the story of Jimmy's dealings with space people. And his meetings with Tony wed of chiddingstone in Kent. The other day, I discovered that Jimmy godowns website still exists. The reason I put it like that is because the headline when you arrive at the website is Jimmy godowns websites still exist. And among among the very many, many pages that you can look at is an entire mass of material devoted to Tony Wade, the founder of the star fellowship, whose greeting with Yabba Sita. Anyway, one of the things that Tony wed apparently did, in about 1961, I think, was to study the alignment of Cree clumps in the West Kent area, apparently without any significant findings. Now, while the alignment of clumps in the West Kent area has rightly attracted the attention of some of our most sensible investigators, the alignment of Cree clumps in the East Kent area has been criminally neglected. Until now. One of the most startling findings of the recent botsman study published in tree clump alignment news is that the alignment of tree clumps in the eastern part of the county is significantly more intriguing than the alignment of Creek clumps in the western part of the county, studied from one angle for example, a particular set of Eastern pre clumps is identical to the alignment of Abraham Zapruder, Batman, umbrella man, Mary Moon Man, JFK and the sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository at the precise moment, the first shot was fired on that fateful November day in 1963. in Dallas view from a different angle, the very same tree clumps are aligned in a pattern One can only call chaotic. A second set of Creek clumps more easterly in Kent than the so called assassination clumps reproduces exactly the disposition of the players on the pitch at the moment when South Africa scored the opening goal in the 2010 world cup, a goal described calmly by the television commentator as one of the most important moments in the entire history of sport. Yet again, seen from another angle, these very same pre clumps form merely a random pattern. The various angles to which I refer are those pertaining between the tree clumps on the ground, and the position of the botsman tree clump project airship in the sky. Obviously, the position of the tree clumps on the ground is fixed, while the position of the airship in the sky is variable. I probably don't need to explain this, but I'm doing so in case you're extremely stupid. Those of you who believe that tree clumps on the ground and not stationary may have been maligned Lee influenced by great works of literature such as Macbeth, or infant tile pieces of Tosh, like all that tolkein twaddle. If you happen to live in the East Kent area, you may have seen the blockman dirigible hovering at varying points in the sky. It looks not unlike the ill fated Hindenburg without the inferno of flames, obviously, although it's clearly identifiable from the word botsman in big bold block capital letters emblazoned across its side it does not identify itself specifically as the tree clump project airship, for it's used in many another blossom and exciting activities, at least in those which require an airship for their completion and hoped for success.

From what I've said, so far, it should be clear that proper perception of the alignment of the East Kent tree clumps depends to a large extent on the altitude and position of the airship. at ground level, it's almost impossible to appreciate the significant patterns created by the tree clumps, one can charge about in one's rambling gear among the assassination clumps or the history of sport clumps, or indeed among the other tree clumps I have not mentioned and be none the wiser. That's why we should be grateful to blockman for making such an admirable use of his airship, rather than leaving it neglected in its giant hangar, as some other airship owners do. I'm not naming names, but they know who they are. But man's interest in the alignment of tree clumps in the East Kent area was prompted not surprisingly by Tony weds important study of the alignment of tree clumps in the West Kent area, but by a stray reference in a yellowing old copy of the sun. biblically, bib Dibs, parish magazine and religious terrain were a writer identified only as righteous wanderer in the woods, makes mention of a wander in the woods when his righteousness was tempted by some sort of hobgoblin tree spirit, green and pagan and covered in leaves and twigs. The author claims that after fleeing from this sprite in fear for his immortal soul, he lay in the bath and realized that the trajectory of his fleeing, if represented in diagrammatic form was analogous to the pattern made by a journeyman hiking between the cantons of Switzerland in alphabetical order. botsman made the intuitive leap in reading this to a recognition that further significant patterns could reveal themselves through close study of the alignment of such things as tree clumps, piles of pebbles, and even the distribution across the landscape of airship hangars. It is the latter to which we will next turn his attention, and I'm proud to say that before taking off in the bottom an airship, he will be making much use of my database of hangars, which I compiled in order fire off a series of sternly worded poison pen letters to their owners. For the benefit of listeners, I would have liked to read one of the letters out here last by proved so toxic has to be lethal. And I would not wish any of you to keel over and perish like a budgerigars zapped by a death ray.

Again, harking back to past programs, many of you will, I hope, recall the hooting yard Christmas special when, together with germander speedwell. I read Christopher smart struble Adi agno. Marvelous poem from the 18th century, which took three hours in all to read. And I discovered a poem that is almost as fantastic for me as dribble Otto eggnog but much, much shorter. So, you know, dribble, Otto agno is always going to win the day because it's so long and maintains that genius for so long. This is much much shorter, but it's very good. I'll give you a little introduction. It's written by Hadrian, Neverland. circa 1651, to 1716. Hadrian. Neverland was a Dutch theologian of sorts and a classical scholar of great erudition. His book detailing the sexual abnormalities of the ancient world was described as abominable and scandalous, and an abortion from deprived brains by the authorities overladen University, and he was banished from Holland as a result. He spent much of the rest of his life in London, and is buried in the churchyard of St Paul's Covent Garden He made various attempts to gain permission to return to his homeland. And when these fails, he developed a persecution mania, to which he gave vent in a series of pamphlets. These take the form of letters to him or purported letters to him from the fictitious parent avago. Together with Neverland responses, Neverland was particularly exercised by a certain Tempest. We called that cursed flatterer and pro famous reprobate who tried to make a tennis ball of a foreigner. Tempest sent girls into the fields who were the ones and I could move old men and trails and when she's with linen, oysters, and orange apples who breathe life into death men lack a day, he complained only for looking fresh in a frosty evening, you must be suspected to be a deadbolt key. Others a part for the man he called the NAT Tempest, was scheming against him, and he said, if the mystery of the plot lies hidden in the bottom of hell, it will not only be difficult to draw it out of the dunghill, but also dangerous to disturb the dragons, snakes and Hornets let them alliances who suck their livelihood out of our caucus glory in their Guile, you avoid their company, so I think I will avoid that company. Anyway. Towards the end of his life, Neverland prepared a catalogue of his collection of paintings for sale. And it was in this catalog that he for some reason, included this verse. The Song of the boats of prey. I have no wife, the devil upon two crutches cheer, cheer, here. Carry me to hell. I do not know my L where Hell is but if it may please your L. I carry you to the devil. Go on to the devil tavern. What upon crutches. I am very old, if it may please your L. No old devil can please me? Have you know younger devils in hell? Yes, long Brown who carries little davits upon his shoulders? What is become a little Gibson?

Frank Key  12:41
He's become a little Gibson indeed. And I think that's great. I just wish he'd written more poetry. There is also the point that English was his second language, even though he lived here for many years. Hadrian, Babyland that was now from his exile in a pompous land, hooting yard reader and listener Mike Jennings has very kindly alerted me to a newly published Film Studies textbook from the University of olma the title translators, or a mate? Are you looking for a punch in the face? host gak and the cinema of belligerence. The first study dedicated to the visionary director of goats and ogres of film from the hillsides Revenge of the pig and the fatal duck pond. This thumping tome collects together essays by some of the most incisive and rigorous minds of tonic academia. Unfortunately, all the contributors have chosen to remain anonymous. Following reports that Horst ghacks mysterious wife and collaborator actrix Primrose dent is not best pleased with the book. We know not why, but then she is an international woman of mystery so her motivations and manias are forever hidden from the public gaze. What's most startling about the book is that it completely avoid the sort of obfuscatory post modernist verbal diarrhea that besmirches so many academic texts these days, the formidable German intellectual have turned their brainpower towards the films of Horst gak do so in prose so plain and simple, it can be understood by tiny tots. This passage from an essay entitled The use of smudged camera lenses in Revenge of the pig is typical. It was translated for us by hooting yards. Reliable old pal Fatima Gillibrand sees a pig sees a pig in black and white. See the pig blurred. See the pig go from the story. To the bomb, see the clouds Doering see the rain falling here host gak cry cut. Here Primrose didn't cry. No, don't cut yet. Here a kerfuffle sees a camera fall off it tripod. Here implications imprecations and threat. See Horst ghacks stomp off to lock himself in his trailer. See the pig emerged from the barn and rolling the muck. See Primrose dent channeling the spirit of Leni Riefenstahl? See the rain continue to pour down relentlessly until darkness falls.

pebble laid the talking of the potboiler because the white kept secret the precise whereabouts of his legendary chalet Oh prose, wherein he tapped out the billions of words of his best selling paperbacks. On a recent hiking holiday, however, the noticed the noted doorbuster Rex daube stumbled upon the location and was able to execute a rapid daube in his portable hikers door boom. You can see the picture on the hooting guard website. If you go to hooting yard.org and type in chalet, oh pros, that'll in the search that'll take you to it. Lots of other stuff to look at while you're there. Anyway, in the picture, the shallow prose itself remains half hidden behind a verdant slope. In the foreground we see posty struggling up the lane heaving a sack full of fan mail. And you can note that he's not wearing a posties uniform. That's because in this mountainous region, wherever it is, all the postings are amateurs. A tradition harking back to the days of King valid, this layman Paki monarch took against professionalized posties in uniform from an early age after a tantrum. It was an opinion from which he never wavered, and his first act upon his coronation was to grant crown licenses for postal delivery to a gaggle of peasant amateurs. The existing uniformed post these were shipped off to a remote and barnacle encrusted at all. Also, in the picture, we can see pebble heads famous seven cows, munching grass on the verdant slope. The paperback is written movingly of these cows, or have six of them at least, and rather more dispassionately, about the seventh in a series of cow related pot boilers. And in the picture clockwise starting from the largest cow, we can see spinach, toffee, apple, milliband, chlorophyll, banana brain graticule, and guest on Lopez Nair, all of them familiar to readers of the series, but not until now visually caught brilliantly, brilliantly as they are by Rex dogs dog. Beyond the shadow pros, the roof of which we see blue, blue, there is some other stuff in the background. But rec dog may have invented this just to finish off his dog. It's a tendency he has when in a hurry, as he often is whether or not on a hiking holiday. For further particulars see a pedestrian memoir of hiking holidays, accompanied by noted dubious direct dog by Dobson out of print.

So yes, there I was standing in a wind tunnel, waiting for the dungarees operative outside to depress the knob which would start the engine. Within seconds of the engine beginning to work. A mighty wind would be created in the tunnel and I would be knocked off my feet. This is exactly what happened. Not only was I knocked off my feet, I was hauled along the floor of the wind tunnel until I hit the big cushions at the end. I sprawled there buffeted and helpless until the dungaree operative peeking in through the porthole saw me and read the press the knob. The Mighty winds that are taken Just seconds to reach its full force, so rather longer to become become a minute or so by my reckoning, though I had no watch upon my wrist. As soon as all was still within the wind tunnel, I stood up, gave the cushions a cursory plumping and returned to my spot. I gestured with a somewhat of feet wave of the hand to the dungaree operative, who was watching me through the porthole. He then depressed the knob again, I was knocked to the floor and hold back against the cushions. We repeated the entire process several times. These were important experiments. As you can imagine, I'll be writing up the results and hope to have them published after peer review in a suitably authoritative journal, one to which many wind interested persons subscribe, I may need the assistance of a buffin to help me Marshal the data and draw out the pertinent conclusions. I will ask the dungaree operative thing he's an operative in purple dungarees not a boffin, nor likely ever to be a boffin. He's happy in his knob, depressing work, and lacks both ambition and wit. The same can be said about me, though I have discovered a knack for toppling over and being buffeted into cushions and I intend to make the most of it. Once my paper has been accepted for publication, I will be heading off by train or boat to another wind tunnel to carry out further important experiments. One must never rest on one's laurels. Even in a wind tunnel.

I've got a certain feeling that I may have read that last week. If I did. I apologize for the repeat. Put it down to too many toppling xover and being holed into cushions in a wind tunnel. Now George Eliot said that a happy home life was a necessity for her to write. It seems the same was true for Dobson who turned out all those innumerable out of print pamphlets while living in domestic bliss with marigold true. But what's happened is indeed this birth is indefatigable pamphleteering. Quite the opposite was the case with Emanuel swedenborg. As I learned from Eric john Dingell, in Eric john Dingell book, very peculiar people portrayed studies in the queer, the abnormal and the uncanny, published in 1950. Mr. Ding wall has a paragraph which I have to say end superbly. As the years went by swedenborg became more energetic than ever. His passion for women's still tormented him for since the rejection of his suit by the young MRN to pull him about 1717 he apparently contracted no other Alliance. There is no doubt that his failure to win her hand had affected him deeply. But he quickly steeled himself against allowing emotion to upset his work. He promptly published a pamphlet on the manufacturer of tin plate. What that might indicate about the home life of our own dear Dobson is worthy of speculation.

So now you know what to do if you're disappointed in love or love sick. publish a pamphlet about the manufacturer of tin plate, or something similar.
