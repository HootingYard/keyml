Hello listening persons. This is Frank key with this week's hooting yard on the air, whether you're listening to it live or on the repeat, or as a podcast. Here's this week's show. Last week, I among other things, I read an extract from a Victorian magazine about spiritual realism and mesmerism called Zeist or possibly the czarist from the realm of old plant od about odac raised and the piece I read was about the various spasms experienced by mediums including one caused by green rays. Anyway, so I was doing some further research into this area of Victorian spiritual ism. And I came upon this quotation from Mrs. Sophia Elizabeth de Morgan, from her 1863 book from matter to spirit, the result of 10 years experience in spirit manifestations intended as a guide to enquirer's and Mrs. De Morgan's speaks about the verses written by spirits. She says. The verses written by the unseen power are often curious and quaint, sometimes ridiculous. But verses not have a low and mischievous character has been given to us as too many other experimenters. The best of these contained beautiful ideas connected with the happiness of a life among the blessings and the good in the world of good spirit. Very lovely descriptions of the scenery of that world or worlds, and much affection of anticipation of reunion among friends and future progress in happiness together. All of this sounded very exciting to me. I mean, there was a possibility, of course of something ridiculous, as she says, but I got myself in the zone and opened myself to the Spirit. And this is the verse that they wrote through me. Mrs. Solange had a green Ray spasm, and extruded a gush of ectoplasm. It was eerie and pale. Then there came of fears Gale actually topples down into a chasm.

This next piece was written by me without the aid of a spirit guide. Yes, anyway, in a piece marking the desert 85 of General Alexander Haig, Christopher Hitchens described the 59th US Secretary of State as a slobbering dough fan. This phrase will be more familiar to hooting yd listeners as the one commonly used to refer to principal Gen CEOs, sickly pipsqueak sullen air, whose official title was his luminous magnificence. The princeling bouncers are Clovis Agamemnon, the pig de pig of UGA and sluis in the islands of Widdecombe sound. That was what it said on his badge. But everybody, including principal Geneseo himself, called him the slobbering dough fan when they were talking about him or indeed talking to him. A typical exchange might go as follows. Principal Geneseo Good grief. Ever since we arrived here at Fort hoity, where I am to review my troop clips and cut a princely dash you slobbering dough fan has been slobbering away and quite taking the shine off my regal, good. The princeling slobber slobber slobber prints for Gen Z. Oh, there you are at it again. Yes, slobbering gopher. I am slapping my forehead hard for you leave me at my way. Same. Perhaps it is your forehead I ought to be slapping if I did not think doing so would make you slobber all the more. The princeling slobber slobber, slobber principle gente. Oh, there is only one thing for it while I remain here at Fort whitey, I must have you out of my sight. So you must go to Fort toity, a mile or two yonder, across the Glinka and stay put, you may take a little group or school of hench persons with you. Now hi the hence slobbering dough fan.

Thus is explained the otherwise puzzling fact that the spindly and sickly and slobbering dough fan found himself that a long hot summer in Seoul Come on the fort toity freed from the repressive influence of his load some papar the princelings slobbering, screw fewer, and on Sundays, he barely slobbered at all. Though there was at Fort toity as at fault whitey, a full complement of domestic staff. He spent much of his time in the first few days, buffing the crenellations with a rag until a glistened when this activity exhausted his weedy Constitution, the princeling sprawled pallid and whan upon cushions on a balcony, gazing for hours, the desert Glinka with its few scattered clumps of lightning blasted shrubbery, and dotted here and there yawning pits of doom, into which would topple from time to time, such small, blind, stupid, furry creatures, as had strayed from their nestings and borrows in search of food. The sun was immense, and golden. In his paperback, potted biography of the princeling pebble head is at pains to point out that the slobbering dough fans balcony cushions what I'm comfortable, and thus that is lolling upon them for untold hours, was a kind of penitence, but penitence for what pebble head does not say, at least not explicitly. At the time of the fort toity summer, the princeling was battered pipsqueak youth and had not the years behind him to have drummed up a kind of catalogue of crimes other writers have imputed to Him, confusing him, perhaps with his black hearted father, or even perhaps with the deranged killer babinski to whom in later life when he had grown an impressive walrus mustache. The princeling bore more than a passing resemblance. Indeed, it became a tactic of babinski whenever the coppers were closing in on him to slobber, the better to outwit them. Certainly, we have not one whit of evidence that the slobbering dough fan was involved in the series of outrages that took place in and around the Glinka in the months before he was installed at Fort toity. In any case, even had he harbored a desire to wipe out great swathes of peasantry, how likely is it that he would have crept about from place to place poisoning wells when all he needed to do as princeling was to drop a word in his father's ear? principal Geneseo was always looking for any excuse to issue a you case for his hench persons and to have them clattering about the place on their fine ferocious horses, bringing death and ruination in their wake. That was the kind of Prince he was those the kind of hench persons. It is possible that pebble had mistranslated the ancient documents getting uncomfortable cushions where he ought to have had gorgeous embroidered pillows stuffed with duck down and a new kind of foam materials soft as marshmallow. The princelings own droppings give no sense that he was consumed by guilt and the desire for uncomfortable cushion penitence, though they're difficult to read, because his slobbering was always at its most slobbery when he was writing, even during that blazing fort toity summer, when he slobbered less in general.

There was an amusing fashion for a brief period in the latter half of the last century for wealthy beat music combos to decamped to chateaus. They're to engage in the jewel activities of high debauch and the waxing of their latest disk as we know For Well, there is nothing new under the sun that it meant some golden orb that beat down once upon the desert Glinka and upon the balcony where the slobbering dough fan sprawled upon his cushions, and one blazing noon, his brain grown hot. The princeling had a sudden thought and clapped his hands to summon a hinge person. The principali Today, I am able to stop slobbering long enough to speak coherently our pad for the hench person's name with our pad. My brain is hot, and I have a sudden thought I want you to go bustling about the villages on the edges of the Glinka and round up some musicians close on the sack button schuurman pipe and drum and what have you. bring them to me at once. Our pad, it will be enacted. Oh slobbering dough fan. Now, our pads the hinge person was a frighteningly efficient fellow, and no sooner had he been given his orders than he was off on a cart drawn by several horses borrowed from principal Geneseo his magnificent horseferry at Fort hoity. As pebble had pointed out for all his evil ways, Principal Geneseo had done much to eradicate sickness among his steed, and the fort hoity horseferry proudly proclaimed itself to be free of glanders headshaking lethal white syndrome mud fever contagious equine metritis rain scald strangles quills or hereditary equine regional terminal asthenia choke grasp sickness, recurrent airway obstruction cerebellar atrophy, lavender foal syndrome, pithy, osis pole evil and many Another common horse disease. So healthy and vigorous with a horse he's pulling his cart that Arpad made the rounds of the villages in a single afternoon, and returned to Fort toity at dusk with various sack Baptists and shore mists and Pipers and drummers. So the unbridled delight of the princeling who cut some capers and slobbered and rewarded are pad with a personal picnic basket. So happy was the princeling that his slobbering became uncontrollable and he had to write down his instructions for the musicians with our pad at his side, mopping the slobber into a cup so it did not drip upon the vellum. Although the original is lost, pebble head was able to reconstruct the princelings scribble, using the technique known as bog allied hallucinate re scribble reconstruction, sitting in a darkened room, kept at a constant chill, and with beetles scurrying across the floor. The best selling paperback just actually wrote two entirely different versions because he was enjoying himself so much, but only one is suitable for family listening. According to pebble head, this is what the slobbering dough fan wrote.

While I was buffing the crenellations with a rag, and more so when I was just lying sprawled on cushions on the balcony, gazing upon the desolation of the Glinka All the while, I have been hearing noises in my head noises, I say, no music, the music of the spheres, or at least between my ears. Now, I can't you raggle taggle band of players to make this music known to the world outside my head. So others, including up sorry, now, I charge you raggle taggle band of players to make this music known to the world outside my head. So others, including our pad here, and the other hedge persons, and my father's majestic horses, and the domestic staff, and all who dwell in Fort toity and beyond. Beyond the Glinka in the villages from whence you came, and elsewhere may hear it. For it is music destined to be immortal? It will allow it will outlast me, as it will outlast my terrible reproachful father principle Geneseo as it will outlast even you who play it. For I command also Arpad with or without the help of his fellow hench persons to devise from polished magnetic pebbles and pointy bits of tin and interlocking wheel. And belts made from the stretchy sinewy guts of badges and the like an engine to entrap and then to recreate this music over and over again. So you need no longer play it and may be gone from Fort toity and returned to your villages. So begin to play upon your sack butts and charms and Pipes and Drums and what have you and I will direct and guide you by just stick ulation of my arms and legs and movements of my brow and by slobbering. The music that's created by fits and starts and with much Agon sounded remarkably like the genre we know today is smooth death metal. Before summer's end, it was blasted by our pads engine across the Glinka from dawn to dusk, occasionally jaunty, sometimes pounding, but mostly just smooth and deathly and metallic, just as the slobbering gopher heard it inside his head. But the summer ended as summers will, and one morning principal Geneseo came to Fort toity roaring his head off on horseback flanked by a triplet of brutish hench persons. Prince for Geneseo. Well slobbering doe fan. I have shut up fort hoity for the bleaker months, and I'm set upon a long and arduous journey to Castle blanket. There's a hole up for the winter, tormenting the peasantry and eradicating disease among the horses and the guide dogs. I wish you to accompany me for so vast is the castle that you can have your own wing to slobbering slobber as you will. The princeling slobber, slobber, slobber. Then came a wind such as swept across the Glinka on autumnal mornings, a bit of wind. Our pad helped the Wi Fi princeling up onto a horse And off he rode slobbering onto the horses magnificent shining mean riding into the wind.

It's taken me quite a while to catch up with this in fact, so long that the blog I read it on is no longer no longer exists. But the lumber room, which was a blog written by someone called elder L. Berry, who now has a different blog called elderberries, ghost. Anyway, ages and ages ago, when he was still writing at the lumber room he wrote, being worshipped by ants is nothing to be proud of. Now I can see where he's coming from, as the Airheads put it, but he's clearly unaware of the Curious Case of old hollub. The coach and mentor of fictional athlete Bob needs to evolve during a period in his life when he was not yet as old as he was due to become allhallows found his prowess as an egg on of sporty feats under severe strain. This was in the days before he had turned the spindly, albeit fictional botnet to evolve into a champion sprinter, and to date, much of his work had been concentrated in the field of ice hockey puck brandishing technique. His record was patchy, but he'd taken more than one raggle taggle team of amateurs through cup competitions, in one case reaching the quarterfinals. It was his attempt to broaden his scope to the training of racing starlings that shattered his confidence. This was old how lobs first and only intervention in non human or in human sport, and he quickly realized he was out of his depth. He found it well nigh impossible to communicate his vision of sportiness to birds, despite filling his pocket with millet and curtailing his habit of throwing rocks at swans. Casting around for tips, he fell in one day upon a sandbank with an animal behaviorist of great repute. This fellow who may actually have been a charlatan, advised old halb to start by working with The aunt worked his way up through stoats and weasels, and only when he knew what he was doing to tackle the starlings. This argument was not without merit for even a sports coach of genius, as old Hello, but undoubtedly was has to have a full understanding of ants and stoats and weasels, their habits and appetite, their anatomies and peccadilloes before hoping to work effectively with either birds or fictional athletes. Thus, the irascible chain smoking coach took up lodgings at the edge of an ant farm, and spent hours upon hours every day drilling the ant in all sorts of sporty disciplines. So fantastic was his rapport with the tiny insects that they came to worship him as a god, one who wore a Homburg hat and spat out much phlegm. They are weird alien insect brains underwent some kind of old halabi modification, and he became their single simple focus, their one and only their world. It was through his work with the ants that old hollub hones the techniques which would make him a legend. And thus, contrary to elderberries, rash statement, he was always proud to be worshipped by them, as well he might be. Unfortunately, he did not go on to wreak his magic with either stoats of all weasels or starlings. For one day, he was out walking when he toppled into a ditch and was put in a clinic for a year or two. As the history books tell us, it was in that clinic from his bed upon the balcony, that old Halabja learned of the existence of fictional athlete Bob minute to volt. The future with set fare.

For some time now I've been considering making a proper study of the hoof patterns imprinted in model snow by celebrities. I speak of course of those celebrities who are hooved. Either pickers their centers or our goat footed beasts spawned by Beelzebub. The latter is often true of those celebrities one commonly sees only from the waist, or indeed neck up. Celebrity centers are rarer that can easily be spotted by the eye trained to spot such things. Central's incidentally is an anagram of elektrischen that is well worth remembering. It will be objected that the last thing the world needs is for hooting yard to descend into the brain dead realm of celebrity fixation, and I agree, see me nod see me no more. See me not so much my head all but detaches itself and rolls along the lane into a ditch. See a cloud of flies etc. Upon my head in the ditch and poke their proposals into my scalp to suck upon my brain. See old farmer frac disperse the flies with fumes from his aerosol repellent canister. See old farmer frack pick up my head and place it in his sack. See old farmer frack trudge along the lane, swing my head in a sack as he heads for the Erie barn. Sorry, where was I is celebrity hoof patterns. They have much to teach us and I do not think we should ignore those lessons just because of celebrity involvement. For example, it was reported to me by an unimpeachable source that a trail of hoof imprint left in an Alpine snowdrift by a well known celebrity center from the world of television cookery programs shows an identical pattern identical to the disposition of sightseers on the grassy knoll in Dallas, at the very moment of the first shot from Lee Harvey Oswald's mannlicher carcano rifle on the 22nd of November 1963. Unfortunately, because the snowdrift melted as snowdrifts do, this cannot be independently verified. Those of you muttering that I ought to have inserted the word allegedly somewhere alongside Oswald's name should go and read your Posner Second example again well attested is the extraordinary set of hoof prints left in mud by a Booker Prize nominated celebrity goat devil in Penge. The pattern formed by the prince viewed from a certain angle in a certain light on certain days in certain mirrors appears to spell out a line or two from the book of Revelation. If written in spidery handwriting by a ham fisted, shaking person. I have seen a blurred black and white photograph of this phenomenon, and I am convinced there is much more material suitable for a lavish coffee table book. Both the book and the coffee table designed to uphold it will be lavish, the latter perhaps more so than the former. It will be built from wood, teak or mahogany stained with the most excellent varnish available, each leg carved to form a mythological figure, representing in turn Europe, America, Africa and Asia, similar to that of the splendid wooden carvings on the massive pulpit in St. Peter's Church in the university town of living in broadband. The sole deviation from the standard iconography will be that each figure will have the hooves of a goat embedded in wooden mud or snow, wood and mud. Ah, it is a fine thing. After that piece appeared on the hooting yard website. It's titled celebrity who print patterns. reader and listener are known only as our did what are often does, which is to create a series of anagrams of the title. So always worth looking at the comments on the hooting yard website. Anyway, and this is actually a sonnet based on anagrams of celebrity hoofprints patterns by our thrifty bleeper contractions fresh and prototypical bitter incontestable frothy tripper, nephritic, ospreay, Battlefront,
