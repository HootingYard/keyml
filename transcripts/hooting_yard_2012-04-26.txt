Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. This is hooting yarden the air. My name is Frank key. I am angry. I am ill, and I'm as ugly as sin. My irritability keeps me alive and kicking. That was me sitting bolt upright in bed upon waking at dawn, singing my little heart out like a trap range or a limit. I sang a song from under the floorboards by magazine. Now regular listeners will be aware that I can't sing for toffee. Recite prose, yes, sing No. But while I would never dream of assailing the ears of an unsuspecting public by singing, or attempting to sing on the airwaves, there's no reason why I shouldn't do so. In the privacy of my own home. It's become apparent to me, you see that the lives of people in film musicals have that little extra spark simply because they have the facility to burst into song at appropriate moments in their day. I'm not personally acquainted with any chimney sweeps. But it seems clear that Bert in Mary Poppins, as portrayed by Dick Van Dyke almost certainly has a happier and more fulfilling life than the average sweep simply due to the fact that he gets to sing about it. The same is true of many of the nuns in the sound of music, their lives circumscribed by the iron rules of convent life, and with Nazis running rampage out with the nunnery walls must have been fairly grim. Who can doubt that by belting out climb every mountain once in a while their hearts were in measurably cheered. Having recourse to a repertoire of songs also allows one to provide a musical commentary upon one's day, which can be a straightforward reflection of one's mood zippity doo dah or an ironic commentary upon it. zippity doo da queuing in the gutter for the soup kitchen version. In the more anarchic musicals Of course, there is little or no connection between what's going on in the characters lives and the songs they choose to break into. Often, suddenly and without warning. It's this latter approach that appeals to me. After all, when I woke up, I wasn't particularly angry, not ill, nor even irritable. I may have been somewhat ugly before printing and printing myself in the mirror until I took on the dazzling appearance of a sun god. But Howard DeVos Dostoyevsky inspired ditty seemed just the thing at the time, as did Hans van a henties raucous and discordant si on pigs, while I prepared what our Belgian pals called head on to bite. in musicals, the characters usually have the benefit of a compliment, whether it be a full orchestra or in certain trendy pop musicals a beat combo. A penurious Scribbler, such as myself, obviously can't employ a troupe of musicians that stand ready out of sight in a corner of whichever room I happen to be in to strike up the tune in those heavy moments before I start singing. At the same time, one doesn't want to limit oneself simply to an acapella soundtrack. In the circumstances, the best thing to do is to throw caution to the winds and to carry on regardless. That's why after breakfast, as I potted aimlessly about before taking my morning stroll, I delivered a spine tingling version of oil a komova by Santana. Later, as I trudged along the towpath of the filthy old canal towards the newsagent, there was a fortuitous conjunction of life and song. I was accosted by a yapping dog which had slipped its masters leash and was now making a canalside nuisance of itself. I couldn't help noticing it was a slow dog with seethrough skin, the kind of dog you can see through so I sang slow dog by belly or as much of it as I could remember. Though I decently refrain from singing into a microphone at the resonant studios, and that's broadcasting my tumulus caterwauling to the masses huddled over their radio sets. I have no such compunction when I'm out and about in my bailiwick.

If I'm over here Saved by a man trailing a leash in search of a fled dog on a canal towpath. I may stop my singing if in sizing him up. I suspect he's intent on silencing me by means of violence. The wisdom of ceasing to sing when so threatened was brought home to me after a memorable incident involving a whirling tangle of intoxicated ruffians, and my rendering of the windmills of your mind famously sang by Knoll Harrison, son of Rex in the film, the Thomas Crown Affair that I was in the vicinity of a windmill at the time was perhaps pertinent, as was the fact that the ruffians had been drinking all day in a squalid Tavern called the cow and pins. Most of the people whose ears may be assaulted by my singing out of doors will not actually beat me insensible as the rough Ian's did. They'll simply pass on by perhaps with a look of reproach or nausea or pity. But it once happened that I was on my way to the newsagent trudging along the towpath of the filthy ol canal when I encountered a trained professional, indeed, famous musician. He was standing on one leg playing the flute. I wish I could remember his name. Anyway, along I came happy as a lark singing jack in the green by Jethro Tull. And this fellow, rather than ignoring me or attacking me, gave me a useful piece of advice. Why he asked, Did I not limit my repertoire to works intended to be formed in sprach Ngawang or even better sprack Dima, I need not sing at all, but could still indulge my musical passion. Well, all I can say is I tried it for a week or two, but quite frankly, Schoenberg Piero Lu Nair begins to Paul after a while, and there are only so many bits of grumpy Germanic avant garde folly. Rola man can tolerate the hands vana, hence, peace works well enough before breakfast, but after that, I like something a bit less difficult. That's why today, on my way back from the newsagent, I sent whole flocks of birds scattering from their purchase with a spirited rendition of hungry freak Daddy, by the Mothers of Invention.

So anyway, continuing with my day, it turned out to be very exciting. Because when I got back home from the newsagent, I received in the post a personal letter from one of the greatest clairvoyance in France and throughout the world. David filled you know, David filled p, HL de, clairvoyance, numerology, astrology, medium magical sciences and remedial magnetism. And he wrote to me with the thrilling news that all good things will come to me in 2012. Just consider this. All January general improvement 18th of February enormous money win in March and encounter with love. All April, Lucky at gambling, one day in May huge success. In June, luxury travel. July, a loved one returns 19th of August, big secret revealed September, colossal inheritance. October, good health confirmed November, your luxury home 24th of December 12 sumptuous gift. David's letter was obviously delayed in the post by those scallywags at the Royal Mail, which explains why the predictions for the first quarter of the year didn't come to pass. There is a very simple reason which is as David says, important, you will not succeed without your service to our ask for it immediately. I'm going to ask you my owl as soon as I finished writing as soon as I finished the show, so at least the rest of the year will go according to plan. What I like about David is that he doesn't raise false hopes. He takes pains to point out that by asking for the owl of celestial protection, I will not actually receive a real bird in the post. Know what I get will be more valuable. A medallion. And I'll quote you from David's letter. This magnificent golden talent man of great value has recognized powers of protection from evil spells from misfortune and from health problems. The engraving and the consistency of your medallion make it one of the most powerful protection domains. It is recognized as fabulous by the greatest grand sages and mediums in the world. The catalysis of the Golden metal and the structure of your skin will generate a variety of beneficial waves that will be your rampart against evil. Some vibrations, extinguish witches spells, as well as spite and bad rumors and tittle tattle against you. The very composition of the medallion provokes a type of recuperative energy that prevents you from wasting money and having to pay out amounts pointlessly that gradually plunge you into ruin. under the protection of the towers man, you will see that a single pound will enable you under certain conditions to live for as long as if you own 100 pounds. The owl can also reactivate your energy and your drive by inundating yourselves with a redeeming force of renewal, you will be able to feel better, faster and for longer without any medical treatment. Who wouldn't want an hour like that? David's letter also warns me though that what I'm doing for you must remain our secret. So very cleverly, the owl medallion is designed to look like a piece of cheap mass produced Tat, which clearly it's not. I contacted several grand sages using a serial powers not dissimilar to David. And they all confirmed that the owl of celestial protection is absolutely the bee's knees in the field of talismanic talismanic celestial protection through the medium of embossed owl on trinket. There is no more powerful owl said one of these grand sages whose name I didn't quite catch, though I understand he resides on a mountain peak in a distant Eastern realm obscured by clouds.

Frank Key  12:54
I've met being slightly disappointed that fantastic as the owl is David nowhere states that is anything but silent emits no hoot. Quite frankly, even though my owl of celestial protection is a free gift. I prefer one that hooted. I'm sure the construction of a battery powered hooting medallion cannot be beyond David's wit. And if he needs financial help for its development and protection, he can use the 32 pounds I'll be sending him as a request. Though nominally this sum is to guarantee my receipt of the sublime and detailed revelation of the 12 major visionary phases. As far as I can gather, the free owl doesn't work without the paid for revelation, or vice versa. Perhaps I need to clear this up with the grand sages before committing myself.

Here is a fable Simple Simon Mehta pie man. Hello. I'd like to buy a couple of your pies please Said Simple Simon slobbering as he spoke as is the way with simpletons. My pies are not for sale, replied the pie man, but you may rent them. I charge a very competitive rate, which compares favorably with that of other players in the rented pie sector. Simple Simon, being simple failed to spot the flaw in this scheme and rented two pies from the pie man. I'm afraid I do not know With one juicy fillings the pies were crammed. Shortly thereafter, Simple Simon sat him down upon a stone took one of the pies from its paper bag and prepare to take a bite. This being the kind of story in which birds can speak, a crow, or possibly a Robin, or a Starling, at any rate, something big kitten feathered, flew down and called or corruptor warning to Simple Simon. Do not even a crumb of the pie. Remember, it is rented and you must give it back to the pie man at the expiry of the agreed rental period. Simple Simon was downcast as he put the pie back in the paper bag. Later, as he roamed the hills and Dales, simple Simon's hunger grew, and he sat him down upon another stone and took a pie out of its paper bag. Surely, just a little bite will do no harm he thought to himself, but as he opened his mouth, salivating a bird, a rook perhaps, or linnet, or a sparrow swooped down and spoke. Do not eat even a crumb of the pie. Remember, it is rented and you must give it back to the pie man at the expiry of the agreed rental period. And so Simple Simon put the pie back in the paper bag and crunched on a hill and dale growing ever more famished. By and by he became so weak that he could walk no more, and he collapsed upon a hillside and took a pie from its paper bag and proceeded to stuffing down his job. And then he took the other pie out of the other paper bag and stuff that down is gone too. And no birds came to warn him, for he had wandered all unsuspecting into a bird free zone. And when several days later, Simple Simon bumped into the pie man as a social gathering. There was a terrible for car and the pie man arranged for hired rough Ian's to beat Simple Simon insensible with baseball bats at dead of night in a disreputable alleyway. Poor Simple Simon. And the moral of this story has something to do with rented pies and talking birds.

I have spoken on this show before many years ago about hiking pickles. And I make no apology for turning to the subject once again. It is I would attest a topic of endless fascination. most reasonable people would agree that there are a few spheres of human activity, which lend themselves to the likelihood of becoming embroiled in a proper pickle as hiking. When we consider just three of the challenges with which the hiker must contend, whether terrain and human folly, it's hardly surprising that pickles are a commonplace of the hikers a lot. But let's not make the mistake of muddling the pure hiking pickle with such other pickles as one might be plunged into when hiking. Take as mentioned the terrain a hiker might be hiking in the fells, and in the enshrouding mist come suddenly upon a tan so suddenly that he fails to break his hiking stride, and instead finds himself ankle or knee or Good heavens waist deep in town water. In itself, this is not a proper pickle, as the hiker merely needs to turn around and hike back out of the wet tan onto the dry fell. There will be a bit of a potter about drying out the Tom soaked boots and socks and trousers never an easy task in the moist air of the enshrouding mist. But this hardly constitutes a pickle. The hiker can sit on a stone and smoke his pipe and consult his map of the fells while awaiting a sunburst not for it to be a proper pickle. We were have to add the detail that lurking in the town below the surface is an unimaginably tangled tangle of sub aquatic creeper or nettle vine, possibly with an eerie primitive sentience, such that the first hint of the hikers legs invading its watery domain, it wraps itself round and round with the rapidity and colossal strength of a boa constrictor fast in trapping the hiker helplessly upon the remote fells in the midst, his cries for help will be unheard, except by the birds of the fell and other creatures. If he dares plunges arms into the town, to make an attempt to untangle his lower limbs from the fiendish vegetation, then his arms too will become entangled, making his predicament all the more terrible. This you can be sure would be a proper pickle. But is it a hiking pickle, per se? You see, I would argue that what we have here in this masterfully theoretical scene is not a hiking pickle, but a tom pickle, or even an uncanny subaquatic sentience, vegetation pickle. The fact that our hiker hiked across the fells to get into this pickle is in a sense, incidental. Given the mist and the time, the very same pickle could happen to say, a farm person in search of lost sheep, or an athlete in training for a prize race, or a commando parachuted onto the fell with instructions to survive until picked up in a weak time. You get all sorts of people on the fells, and not all of them are hikers. The true hiking pickle then, is one in which the action or deed or pursuit of hiking is fundamental to the pickle itself. What we must excuse me, excuse me, I've just been handed a piece of paper, rife with scribbling.

Frank Key  22:21
I see when reading it that the scribbling is pertinent not just to the topic of hiking pickles in general, but to the specific theoretical pickle I've just described. I better read it out so that you can hear what it says and to avoid accusations that I'm trying to set myself up as the sole authority on this breathtakingly exciting subject. It reads as follows. A counter blast to Mr. Keys assertion that the theoretical pickle described is not a hiking pickle. In attempting to portray the pickle as a tom pickle or an uncanny sub Aquatic Center and vegetation pickle, Mr key posits three non hiking persons to whom the pickle could have happened. I will take each of these three in turn and demonstrate in each case the absolute wrong headedness of Mr. Keys argument. One, the farm person in search of a lost sheep. It is well known that found persons now every inch of their land, be it fell or Meadow field or Dale, they know every blade of grass, every pebble every ditch Every sprig. They certainly know where a bloody town is. Even in an enshrouding mist high on the fell, the farm person would never plunge inadvertently into a town. And even if we wildly surmise that he did, he would like all farm persons be wearing Wellington boots, from which he could easily extract his lower legs and leap with great agility out of the town and onto the fell before the submerged creeper or nettle vine had sufficient purchase to entrap him. The outer part of Wellington boots being smooth, unlike a hikers boots to the athletes in training for a prize race. In this case, Mr. Keys era is so blindingly obvious that the slow witted monkey would not make it we have an athlete scampering across the fell his brain focused entirely upon the finishing tape of the prize races in training for so when he plunges all unawares into the mist hidden tan. Does he stop and allow his legs to be entangled by creepers and nettle vines? Of course he doesn't. He keeps on running like the tip top athlete he is emerging on the other side of the tan before any eerily sentient vegetation has a chance to bring him to a halt. Three, the commando parachuted onto the fell with instructions to survive until picked up in a week's time. commandos are armed to the teeth. Within seconds of having his lower limbs in tangled, the commando would have unsheath the knife so sharp it would make you shudder and hacked and slashed at the vegetation to free himself. If in the process, he hacks and slashed his own legs, he would not care one jot for as well as knives and guns. He has packed in his kit sways upon sways of bandages and sachet upon sachet of disinfectant unguents. And as soon as he has clambered commando fashion out of the tan and onto the fail, he will smear and patch up any wounds he has inflicted on himself and be on his way, bent on survival. Is that clear that the pickle Mr. Key described is indeed purely a hiking pickle, and could not in any circumstances short of Aaron's stupidity be considered as any other type of pickle whatsoever. Stand No, I hike corrected
