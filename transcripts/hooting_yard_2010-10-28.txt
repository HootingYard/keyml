Good evening This is Frank key with hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. Live from London as ever, or you can we might be listening on your computer, or even on one of the podcasts, of which there are hundreds of hundreds of podcasts available from resonance. And within that hundreds, hundreds and hundreds, seemingly hundreds of hooting out on the air anyway. I better get on with it. Really. Here's a simple method of grasping a weasel by the scruff of its neck, hypnotizing it and having it do your bidding. One take one weasel to grasp the weasel by the scruff of its neck and hold it so that its head is no more than a couple of inches from your eyes. Three, stare into the eyes of the weasel one making hypnotic weaselly noises for place the weasel carefully on your floor and issue it with a command five when the weasel returns from its mission, pick it up by the scruff of the neck and repeat step three. Substituting a hypnotic weaselly noise with anti hypnotic weaselly noises. Six, release the weasel. What could be simpler than that? Indeed, the only difficulty most students find is to think up a suitable command for the hypnotized weasels who obey. experience shows that tasks involving high pitched squealing and savagery are likely to achieve the best results. If you're of a squeamish disposition, command the weasel to do it slashing and slaughtering in another room or even outside in your front garden. If you have a front garden, try to remember that weasels will attack most effectively if set upon organisms of equal size or smaller than themselves, although in certain circumstances, they can prove lethal and terrifying pitted against larger beings, particularly if such beings are tethered to a stout post. advanced students may wish to attempt the grasping, hypnotizing and commanding of more than one weasel at a time. Even more advanced students can admit steps five and six and maintain a pack of hypnotized weasels primed and ready to do their bidding in perpetuity, or until the weasels die.

I squelched across the marsh in driving rain, and limits sang within my brain. There were no limits to be seen. Just crows drenched crows drenched crows. I left my pipe and sucked and heard the core of a drenched crow. The rain was pelting down as I made my slopping way from Marsh to town. And in the town, no limits. No nor crows, just shuttered kiosks, and the stadium. An athlete threw his Javelin in the air. I watched it soar then stab the sudden grass. I went to the canteen, an RT print of crows hung on the wall. I slept a bowl of steaming warming broth, and then I caught a bus back to the marsh.

I don't really know what that was all about. But I wrote it the other day in a fit of thinking about crunched crows. A question that has occurred to me recently. Ambrose bierce, the 19th century Well, 19th and 20th century American writer, author, most famously the devil's dictionary, and a man who as hooting, your listeners will know had 12 siblings all of whose names also began with the letter A. Anyway, I've been wondering, did Ambrose beers grow up on screen hunahpu farm yard, or an eerily exact replica of it? There's something very, the rustic squalor of which hooting our listeners are so fond comes up in this. In his magazine The Wasp on splendidly named the wasp on the third of November 1883. Ambrose bierce published a poem called the old Oaken bucket, and it begins like this. With what anguish of mind I remember my childhood, recalled in the light of knowledge since gained the malarious farm, the wet fungus grown wild wood that kills then contracted that since have remained the scum covered duck pond. The pigsty close by it, the ditch with a sour smelling house drainage fell, the damp shaded dwelling the foul barnyard niat. But worse than all else, was that terrible well, and the old Oaken bucket, the mold crusted bucket that must cover the bucket that hung in the well.

Marvelous stuff. They're from Ambrose bierce. And this is a story called The Defiant Ones. The Defiant Ones lodged in a suite in a hotel at the foot of a tremendous mountain. There were several of them. It's impossible to be precise about their number for true to their name, they defied accurate counting. If you attempted to take a tally, you would discover that one had popped out to the post office, or was concealed behind an heiress, or one was counted twice by being duplicated in a mirror, or by radically changing his appearance in the middle of the counting. And after all, did it really matter how many or how few they were the Defiant Ones. It mattered to the major Domo, who ran as he liked to put it a tight hotel. Most people would have used the common phrase, a tight ship, but the major Damo hated nautical metaphors for reasons buried deep in his psyche, if he could be said to have a psyche, and whenever he was tempted to use one, he plumped for hotel imagery instead. So he would say, worse things happen in hotels, rather than worse things happen at sea, or refer to the mama hotel, in place of the mothership. Because of these verbal idiosyncrasies, it was often said of him that he was born to the hotel business, even though in truth he was the progeny of death defying circus acrobats. Was it their defiance of death that caused him to be so preoccupied with the Defiant Ones in the suite of the hotel. It cannot be said that death was among the things defined by the defined ones. For at least one occasion, the problem of counting them accurately hinged upon the fact that one or more of them had died and rapidly been in coffin and carted away to a burial ground. The major Damo or his proxy tally man, was unable to match the number of dead defined ones with the number of coffins seen delivered to the hotel, nor indeed with the number of coffins later carted away. Oh, such perplexity Now you would think a tally man employed by the hotel for the specific purpose of conducting counts and tallies, with no other duties to bother his big hairy head could be relied upon to arrive at accurate numbers. And indeed, when counting rooms or corners in curry doors or cutlery services or flower beds or types of blossom depicted on pawn wallpapers, the tally man could not be faulted. He was even awarded bonuses. But the Defiant Ones their numbers and their coffins defied him. This wreaked havoc with his sense of professional tallying worth and for a time he took to drink He might have ended in the gutter, where it not that his slide into degradation and debauch was halted by the major Damo by dint of persistent hectoring, underscored by vivid hotel related metaphors. Imagine a hotel, the major Damo would begin slapping the tally man round the face in a pantry or a cubby whether later Latta taken refuge with a bottle of mother's ruin. The metaphors came pouring out thick and fast, until a tally man had sobered up and could see in his mind's eye a gorgeous and glorious hotel, perched on a promontory overlooking a glittering sea, a sea empty of shipping. In his turn, the major Damo began to imagine his own hotel emptied of the Defiant Ones, how he wished they would leave. He gave instructions to the chamber maids to neglect cleaning the sweet, but the Defiant Ones defied this ruse by doing their own cleaning. He had their breakfast sausages, overcooked or undercooked, or in desperation, wholly absent from their plates, but they defied this by filling their bellies with extra kedgeree or kippers obtained through machinations the major Damo could never fathom, and his tally man was helpless to prevent. He went

so far as to devise a plot Helio gambella slyke to construct a false ceiling in their suite with a view to smothering them under a cascade of roses and violence. But the Defiant Ones defied this by burning to a cinder, every single florist shop for miles around. Those florists who had lived above their business premises, which was almost all of them, now took rooms in the hotel, and this was to prove the undoing of the Defiant Ones. Their act of arson had been ingeniously disguised as act of God, and thus, they were not viewed with suspicion by the newly arrived florist hotel guests. Yet an equilibrium unacknowledged but decisive was upset. The tally man quite capable of taking accurate count of the florists reported their numbers daily to the major Damo. And though the Defiant Ones still defied counting, it became obvious even To the untrained eye that they were outnumbered by florists. How could they hope to defy this Stark fact, except by recruiting further defined ones to their uncountable band, but there were only so many beds, so many easy chairs, so much oxygen that could be crammed into this sweet, something that Defiant Ones could not defy? Try as they might, with a physical laws, which governed not just the hotel, but the universe itself. So try they did, they all sat up one night out on the balcony of their suite by turns imploring the heavens and casting runes and conjuring Beelzebub to appear in a cloud of smoke and maneuvering their arms in obscurely significant passing movements through the cold air. But in the morning, the balcony was the same balcony, the suite the same suite, the hotel, absolutely the same hotel at breakfast, there were no sausages to be had. So they saw the plates of the florist piled high with them. The Defiant Ones stuffed themselves with their mysteriously obtained kippers and kedgeree and went clumping out of the breakfast room, making as much noise as possible defiance act on each of their defined countenances. They hiked halfway up the mountain, and took shelter in a bigger act from where they could look down upon the roof of the hotel, with its towers and chimneys and turrets. Sudden gusts of icy wind whipped in, but they defied them staying where they were huddling close together on the mountainside, then from above, from far above, a rumble of dislodged rocks. The Defiant Ones could not defy a mighty Alpine avalanche. The hotel however, could. The major Damo had seen to that at the first stirrings of the rumbling rocks high above, he said the tally man to count and count again the avalanche protection devices, and he gathered the florists and all the other guests in the hotel ballroom and he announced in He's surprisingly high and squeaky voice. Imagine a hotel, a hotel, it evaporates at the approach of tumbling rocks and an Alpine avalanche. And then the very same hotel identical in every detail comes shimmering into solid form miles away at the foot of a different, more stable mountain. And all around the fields are rife with blossoms, a riot of blossoms ready for the plucking. Imagine that. And so they did. And so we do.

The other day, I was fossicking in a cupboard, and I found a scrap of paper, on which years ago, I had scribbled the following 11 pet of a bottle and duty 48 withering 53 Russo's wife 56 her Tony in theory 6364 Buckland 76 Robert Dick, biscuit 7778 McGillivray his journey at Philip Goss diary entry at two Buckland concealed hammer on the Sabbath 129 discovery of plankton. Anyway, deploying my Sherlock holmesian deductive skills. I worked out that these were notes I had made long ago when reading the naturalist in Britain, a social history by David Ellison Allen, published in 1976. Seeking enlightenment I located the volume on the teetering bookshelves of hemoglobin towers and turned to the relevant pages. In some cases, it was no longer clear to me what had sparked my interest. But others I was extremely pleased to be reminded of here are the relevant quotes. PAGE 53. Russo's extreme short sight was such the best of times he saw the landscape as a blur, while his wife in similar fashion, never knew what day of the week it was, and never even learned to tell the time.

Buckland in many ways, Buckland was undeniably a very curious person, an orderly truncated man. He sported childish gestures and puns devised peculiar contraptions went in for the weirdest kinds of food. It was typical of him that he drove around in a special kind of carriage strengthened in an ostentatious manner, he carried around a mysterious blue bag. He led his students on excursions into the field, wearing quiet in Congress, mostly formal closed. Robert Deck, the botanist of Thurso, made it his regular practice to walk all day for up to 40 miles with one ship biscuit as his only sustenance. Philip Henry Goss became so lost in his work that he registered the birth of his only child with the remarkable entry in his diary. Received green swallow from Jamaica, he delivered have a son

So anyway, the story the default the Defiant Ones of the Defiant Ones which are read just now and with an Alpine avalanche, and we're back so the outs now many years ago, many many years ago Sometime in the last century, I wrote a story based upon an alphabetic structure called abandoned zoo. Yet I could so easily have used the title Alpine zombie to retrieve the same narrative end. Whereas abandoned the zoo was about an abandoned zoo, Alpine zombie had it ever been written would have been a better zombie in the Alps, the mood rather than being one of misty melancholy, and, as I recall, there was a great deal of mist in abandoned zoo. The mood would have been closer to terror as the zombie stalked denizens of the Alps, such as goat herds and yodeling Edelweiss pickers. I might even have arranged for a walk on part for Captain von Trapp memorably played by Christopher Plummer in the film version of the sound of music. How would the Austrian martinet have dealt with a threatening zombie? The cold imperious contempt with which he faced the Nazis? Would not our wager suffice to cower great, lumbering, glassy eyed member of the Living Dead community, as I suppose we should call them nowadays, I haven't read enough of the literature to know if a zombie can be stopped in its tracks by a person brandishing an acoustic guitar gathering around him an ex nun and several tinies and launching into an Alpine sunlit, it would be a tactic worth trying at least once, and that could be made the central incident at the heart of the story called Alpine zombie. Give given that the central figure in the tail would be a monster of the mountains, my prose would have to glisten with sufficiently bright clarity to ensure the reader did not mistake the zombie for Himalayan Yeti. Inserting the proper names of a number of notable Alpine peaks would help to pin our yarn to which geographical cushion their deployment within the text could follow an alphabetic schema to enhance the A to Zed superstructure of our story. Thus, the zombie could pursue Captain von Trapp from Al fubu to zanella rot horn, taking in say, Blue Moon leads and Cary alto and Dom and Eiger and Finch dinar horn Finn start our horn and grinning and Hawk goal and so on and so forth along the way. So haphazard an incoherent a journey may make no sense. But in dizzying the brains of both the reader and Captain von Trapp himself, it would no doubt add to the terror of the tale. It would probably be a good idea to have the ex nun and the tinies also menaced by zombies, perhaps while cowering in a chalet

Oh, anglepoise man toss me a bone, for I am famished and dressed in rags. They sent me to mudchute to jabber and keen, which was fine by me. I had no particular plans for October, I traveled there by train, clutching a mitten full of coupons. Before I arrived, it occurred to me that I am totally irrelevant in the grand scheme of things as seen from the perspective of site, a mudchute Magnifico there are plenty of magnetic cogen mudchute more than you might imagine. Yes, you anglepoise man. My disembarkation from the train had something of the fast about it. Rick's would have approved after I pulled up my trousers ragged, ragged. I swept across the pavings towards my assignation. At this stage, I already wanted a bone upon which to nor but there was no sign of you, nor of any other superheroes. I could have had noodles from Hong fat goon, but do you know what? They were despicable noodles? So despicable indeed, that In comparison, I took on an air of nobility. If I planted myself next to the noodles, even in my rags and insignificance, I would have brightly like young Apollo, but what sort of behavior would that be? Foolish behavior? That's what I took out my post at the jabbering and keening slab put there by a Pavia, a proper mudchute Pavia. Did you know there are almost as many previous as magnific codes? I didn't. But then I know very little about mudchute. Still, for instance, I had absolutely no idea it was your spiritual home anglepoise man. I always thought you hailed from somewhere far away, even mythical zimbler or gondwanaland. Nobody ever asked me to Kenan Jabba there in either of them in October or any other month in spite of my culture of coupons. My mittens are the only part of my apparel that are not rags. They were donated to me by a benefactor. He bore a striking resemblance to you anglepoise man, perhaps is your brother, or one of your dozens of cousins. He gave me mittens instead of the bone I wanted wanted, yearned for. Oh, to yearn for a bone. What am I become irrelevant, insignificant, surely, at least I may buff my shriveled sense of self with the knowledge that I am not as despicable as the noodles. Not yet anyway.

And that's the end of this week shooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to visit the hooting our website at hooting yard, one word.org. While you're there, you can buy books, you can read millions of words, look at some pictures and make a donation or even take out a subscription. That would be nice. Anyway, the website is always there. And I will be back same time next week with more of pretty much the same kind of stuff. Bye bye
