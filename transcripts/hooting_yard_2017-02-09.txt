Frank Key  04:22
You may remember if you were listening last week, you may remember piffle boy, the cartoon character I think he was Yes, he was in piffle boy comic. And before we go on, I feel that I cannot let the passing of tower Parma Tomkinson go without comment. It may surprise some listeners to think that I would really care about Tara Parma tompkinson but for me, she will always be immortal, really immortalized by one of the great quotes Patients uttered by her will declaimed by her in the early years of this century. And I think that quotation, which should never be forgotten, and Tara will forever be remembered because of it. It came towards the end of a series of that celebrity thing where they put people in the jungle. Get what does it get me go? I'm a celebrity. Get me out of here. Thank you, john. Anyway, she was Tara Palmer Tomkinson was in an episode of or a series of this, and it was towards the end of the series. And one of the other guests in this era, you need to know one of the other people in the series was Henri Geller, the famous boon bending charlatan? How did that man make a career out of bending spoons? I do not know. Anyway. Henri Gabba had been one of the guests. I think he was gone. And towards the end of the series, I think nearly to the left, Tara Palmer Tomkinson and someone else and I were clearing up the mess from solomid ness. And at one point, the other person held up this kind of bit of fabric or cloth or a rag or something, which was the cue for the great the great quotation by Tara Parma Tomkinson. As I say, she kind of declined it. So there's this person, I can't remember who was holding up this something and Tara said, those are his underpants burn them.

Frank Key  07:10
Anyway, rest in peace car apom of tompkinson. You will not be forgotten for those that are Reese underpants burn them. And France in the immediate aftermath of the revolution was not the only place in which a commissioner seeking to climb a bell tower would be deterred by the presence of an axe wielding madman. It is a dilemma which is faced many commissioners have differing stripes in many lands many times. What all we known and recorded instances have in common is the difficulty of ascertaining whether the woodcutter in the belfry is truly a madman, or is feigning madness as a ruse. No Commissioner, it appears, has ever been able to say definitively upon entering a bell tower with an axe wielding woodcutter in situ, ah, a genuine madman, or conversely, a hoe a perfectly center more wood cutter pretending to be mad. A recent scholarly analysis of the phenomenon sheds light on the methods commissioners and their minions have used to decide the question. It is not an incandescent light nor even a bright one for the past is suffused with a great darkness. As Pang Gong loon demonstrated in his important paper on the subject, the title of which escapes me understandably, as it was published a long ago in the past, and was thus suffused with a great darkness. Withdraw that goes to prove pangong loon point. If proof were needed me I'll take him at his word. Even when the darkness is pitch black, we may still cast glimmers of light if we deploy what Pang Gong loon called the pointy torch of inquiry into it. The author of the recent scholarly analysis clearly has such a point he taught for in the study, we find such accounts as this high altar the I am a commissioner. My most recent commission was to go to the bell tower of St. Beverly, they did bibs trudge in the vicinity of Bristol lane, and to count the bells. When I had counted them. I was to report back to the county Bell counting register panel. There my duties ended a straightforward task, but one nevertheless calling for a large breakfast, which I proceeded to enjoy in the salumeria setting of Alfonso his dining room hard by the banks of the toss. I had sausages and kettles and kedgeree and thrash brains and wolves livers and custard triangles, and milk slops, and drugged hair and toasted grease and Dr Baxter's fine pudding and a pig's head and ran in it, and smokers Pop Tarts, all washed down with a pot of boiling hot tea. I then summoned my minions and we headed for some bibley babe did. One minion carried my propelling pencil and the other my belt counter ledger victory Vich gate was off it snack but that was no business of mine. I paused to weep but the grave of a floozy of past acquaintance, but then it was down to business, or should I say up for we must climb the bell tower to count the bells. No sooner had we entered the church, however, the cry came from above. To my ears sounded like the inarticulate gibbering of a madman. I sent minion laws to the foot of the bell tower to pay upwards and to tell me what he saw. He reported that, as so often happens, the belfry was occupied by an axe wielding madman who would surely cut us to bits if we dared venture further. I took from my pocket my two way radio contraption and gave the details to HQ. They said a mad doctor would be sent immediately and I should do nothing until he got there. I actually had the minions into the belly did Dibs Alex, where there was a snack bar. We've tucked into toffee and boiled seal and cold bad plums. While we waited.

Frank Key  11:52
The Mad Dr. Julie arrived on his motorbike at Oh 955 hours brain probe in one hand and pack of flashcards and the other he sprinted up the spiral staircase, like a man half his age, which is estimated to be in the region of 40. What went on up there I have no idea. Though I assume he probed the x man's brain and tested him with the flashcards each of which bore a mysterious occult symbol. At approximately 1005 hours, the bloodied corpse of the Mad doctor toppled from the belfry it was missing the head. I radioed through the details to HQ who advised that the x man in the belfry was almost certainly a genuine madman or not one of those pretenders who fame madness as a ruse to prevent Bell counting by commissioners. As I am the bravest Commissioner in the entire commission. I offered to climb up to the belfry and give the madman the sound thrashing with my seagull beatings stick before he had a chance to chop my head off with his axe. But I was forbidden to do so by a cue, who suggested I returned to the snack bar to await the arrival of the priest and the verge and the Sexton. All of whom were on an unofficial Biblis bid did share a bank outing. Unfortunately, by this time, the snack bar was shut. So I blew off steam by giving mini in laws and mini and Tim a sound thrashing with my seagull Beating Stick. Then I sat on the floozies grave to write this report in my bell count ledger with my propelling pencil.

Frank Key  13:48
This is but one of no fewer than three contemporaneous accounts of Commissioners confronting axe wielding madman in bell towers cobbled together in this fascinating piece of scholarly analysis. Frankly, I'm not convinced that the analysis following the accounts is up to snuff. But then I'm no scholar. I'm nearly a fanatical devotee of the teachings of pangong loon, if you have any sense in your head

Frank Key  14:45
had an ambivalent attitude towards the footnote. From the footnotes as a reader in his own writing, he took pains to avoid them. He gave some indication of his thinking in the pamphlet, it behoves me to write at some length On footnotes without footnotes out of print, and I quote, when I'm reading a book or a pamphlet or a hysterical tract, I'm very fond of footnotes. Indeed, I lapped them up, I have been known to ignore the main body of the text and read only the footnote. Yet when it comes to the composition of my own sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose, it is my staunch belief that one should avoid footnotes wherever possible, and in bed or incorporate the matter of the footnote into the main text. This can and indeed usually does have the effect of interrupting the flow of one's argument and risks undermining the majestic sweep of one's prose. Why then do is to the footnote. My guide in these matters was have on straubing Z, who taught me to write in the old wooden schoolroom long ago. Now it must be admitted that his own pathological loading of the footnote was born, not of reason, nor of a concern for the felicities of style, but of childhood trauma. Heavens throbbing Zee had been orphaned young, and he held a footnote responsible for his parents death. I could never quite grasp the details, though he often told us the story, as he handed around our rations of blotting paper, and Frau von Straub and z would enact the grisly episode through the medium of shadow puppetry in the old wooden schoolroom when our lessons were over for the day. As far as I could gather, it was something to do with a footnote appended to a funicular railway timetable. In some remote Alpine fastness, and the consequences thereof oddly, have on Strabane z was fixated on the footnote, rather than on funicular railways themselves. Indeed, both he and Frau von Straub and z were daily passengers on one, as we're all we tinies from the old wooden schoolroom was otherwise inaccessible, perched as it was high up on a mountainside. But a psychological flaw or no, the abomination of footnote to express by my pedagogue had a lasting effect. I remember when I made my first faltering steps as a pamphleteer and sent a draft of a draft in preparation for my first ever pamphlet, never in print to have on straubing z. I was young and cocky and included in the draft a provocative footnote. My main text included the phrase the content of an ostrich his stomach, I plopped a superscript number one after this, thus threatening further footnotes, and added at the foot of the page. One, the contents of the stomach of an ostrich, which died in London Zoo in 1942. included a lace handkerchief, a buttoned glove, a length of rope, a plain handkerchief, probably a man's assorted copper coins, metal tacks, staples and hooks, and a four inch nail a step too far, and the cause of death. Heaven straubing z returned my manuscript unread, partly blotted out, partly burned and torn into 1000 pieces, he enclosed a note in which he consigned to me to the deepest pit of hell for all eternity. He had no power to do so. Of course, though, I've always suspected that for albums through albums he did, but I felt suitably intimidated and center forming a letter of apology, in which I promised never to knowingly write a footnote ever again, so long as I should live. This seemed to do the trick. And over the next few years, I retained the good graces of my old teacher. He sent me a crate of Carlsbad plums on my birthday. Well, one year he did. The following year, he sent me a sausage after that, not a sausage, and then later, of course, he died.

Frank Key  19:24
It was after the death of heaven straubing z that I fell prey to the temptations of the footnote. I no longer need fear his disapproval flower runs through albums, he was still among the living Very much so. But she had always poo pooed her husband's footnote Oh phobia, so I had no cause for concern from that quarter. I remember the first time I felt impelled to insert a post heavens travels the footnote into one of my pamphlets. Curiously enough, it concerned the pedagogue himself. The pamphlet was hysterical reaction. The misprint footnotes, redactions and blotting mishaps in Alpine funicular railway timetables. 1900 to 1949. out of print. I had constructed a particularly fine paragraph on the Von steuben Z's and felt I have to disclose that their orphaned child went on to become my teacher in the old wooden schoolroom perched high on a mountainside. I did not see how I could include this Goblet of information in the text without fatally undermining its weeping majesty. And so with a heavy heart and hope that have on three albums, he would not be rolling in his grave. I made it a footnote. I may well have gone on to shove footnotes willy nilly into my prose thereafter, had it not been for the reaction it provoked. In those days, my templates would occasionally be reviewed in Burnage journals. And it was one such review in the learned Journal of historical reactions to misprints, footnote, redactions and blotting mishaps in our pond funicular railway timetables that stopped me in my tracks. A certain B tick wrote a new Dobson pamphlet is usually a cause for rejoicing in this neck of the woods. Indeed, our small editorial team has been known to crack open a bottle of vitamin enhanced goatee milk, when posted toils up the gravel path bearing the latest outpouring of the Titanic pamphleteer. We don't much care what he writes about so long as it's suitable reading matter for a funicular railway journey, which with Dobson it always is. This time, however, he is trespassing on a subject about which we know not a little, I would go so far as to say we know everything there is to be known. I had hoped to be able to say that he has acquitted himself with a plum, but alas, he has not. This is a witless and foolish pamphlet, marred particularly by an extraordinary jarring footnote. Had Dobson inserted. The footnote did matter within the main body of his text. I would be singing his praises and extolling the pamphlet, as perhaps the finest of all his works. But if you're going to thrust footnote upon your reader, you have to know how to wield it. Dobson hasn't got a clue. He thinks it's enough merely to plop a superscript one into his text, and then add some blather at the foot of the page. Did he ever listen when tiny to the wise words of have on Straub and z in the old wooden school room perched high on a mountainside and accessible only by funicular railway. He must have had an excess of earwax that prevented him from hearing that great man. The review went on like this for page after page and quite frankly, I threw the learning journal aside before I finished reading it and broke down sobbing. When I dried my eyes, I used a matchstick to dig around in my ears to remove the clotted wax that had been accumulating for decades. Then I made a vow never to write another footnote for as long as I should live. This will explain to my readers why so many of my pamphlets consist of little else but subsidiary and incidental matter. works such as subsidiary and international matter appertaining to hysterical reactions to misprint, footnotes reduct redactions and blotting mishaps in Alpine funicular railway timetables. 1900 to 1949 out of print are in fact, the footnotes I could have written. I could have, but never did.

Frank Key  24:24
listeners who haven't got ear wax stuffed in their ears will have noticed that the two previous pieces both mentioned Carl's bad plans. This is continuing our 2017 theme in which plans turn up more often than they don't.

Frank Key  24:47
As far as I can recall, there are no plans in the following piece, although maybe there are I don't think so. This is a cautionary tale I backed my bonds upon a shelf dislodging from it a tiny elf. It tumbled down onto the floor and scampered out through my front door. I followed it as best I could all the way into a wood. The wood was mostly large in line and the elf was bent on an awful crime. I walked as it picked a wood cutters pocket as it ran away. I tried to block it. Then I saw his face the hideous elf. It looks uncannily like will self I fainted away in shock and fright. And when I woke it was deep this night. The woodcutter led me to a Glade and gave me tea and marmalade. I spooned it straight out from the jar. Then we got into the woodcutters car and drove around in the pitch dark thinking it would be a lark, but it was not for we came a Cropper and were arrested by a copper. He took us to the local Nick, where I began to feel quite sick. locked in a cell I bewailed my fate. Then the elf came in fat oozing hate. He bashed me on my bonds again. And then he turned into us hen, not any hand, one with no head. And then I woke up in my bed. It had all been a terrible dream occasioned by too much ice cream. So tinies make sure you behave yourselves, or you will be beset by hens and elves by a headless hen. And a terrible elf who looks exactly like will self.

Frank Key  27:02
That's all we've got time for this week. That's the end of hooting yard on the air. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed the details of the Carlsbad plums and elves elves seem to turn up in a couple of pieces this week. Anyway, as john said earlier, we won't be here next week. When we Yeah, we we will be here next week, but not in our usual format. Because we'll be doing the pull the hooting yard opera plug our whatever it's called with Richard Scott, and that's in a that will be because next week is the midst of the fundraising week.

Yeah, so all next week is a fundraiser aiming to raise thousands of pounds for your favorite radio station and doo doo make sure you stump up some cash. Bye bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:24
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers. They wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
