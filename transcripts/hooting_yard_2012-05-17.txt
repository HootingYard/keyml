Good evening This is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. With me Frank key. Two weeks ago on the last show. I read the first part of an old, a 20 year old story from the last century, called accidental deaths of 12. cartographers number eight, can butter case, which was published in massacre magazine in 1992. And I'm going to continue with the story this week. beginning where I left off, I think I'll repeat the the the what I think was the what I think was the final paragraph of the last show. I will begin with that. Those of you who recall the newspaper reports of the grab bag prediction, will be aware that can butter case never reached the Antarctic. The navigator was so inept that he took the ship not to the southern seas, but to the lemur riddled western coast of Sumatra. In the Dutch East Indies. Botha cases map of Sumatra was his first and arguably finest cartographic achievement. Having abandoned his shipmates, his first step was to enter the general store in blending, and using the small sum of cash he had stolen from the persons hatbox import important knapsack, some cakes, a compass, a shirt, affecting little hat, a jar containing a substance no longer obtainable on Earth. Although it was quite common at the time, a guidebook, some clips, and led lines smock and a wind jammer, among other things. Then he set out on foot to cover the whole island, it took him five years. He began by keeping to the coastal route, tramping from bling bling all the way up to Ole. Then along the eastern coast through Eddie ballet, and repacked until once past telok betong. He returned to his starting point. He took the opportunity to call into the general store, and I was clipped D rusted and his hat stitched. Then he headed off into the interior, zigzagging his way north east nor west, north, east nor West until he reached sigley. All this time, he'd been taking copious notes, and he was now ready to begin work on his map. He returned to Berlin being on a motorbike and holed up in a shack, sustained by Romanian beans and hooch. He worked for a further two years, using an enormous sheet of waterbath paper and a collection of colored pencils. A stupendously detailed description of the map appears in krones anthology of Sumatra maps concocted by felons, hooting yard press 1937, to which the listener is referred. But that's quite enough about max for the time being. of more interest is the fact that Around this time, but a case fell in with a gang of near do wells who haunted the more disgusting sinks of advice in iniquity and blending. And when it was learned that he was an accomplished accordionist he was invited to join their jazz band. The band was led by the scrofulous but benign cornetist lip suck jab, a Korean who had been hounded out of his country following the infamous unsaturated postage stamp scandal of 1922. Suck jabs musical gifts was slight, but what he lacked in technique he made up for with what can only be described as stage presence. Slightly less than five feet tall and impossibly wrote and he held audiences in Thrall. Several critics have attempted to explain precisely what it was about the man that was so spellbinding. Was it his occasional impersonations of Constantin Brancusi, or Cicely Courtney, was it the metal harness he strapped to his head, which emitted incandescent light was it the pocket falls of custard triangles, with which he showered the audience at the end of each show? Who can Say what we do know is that when his regular accordionist was drowned in a freak dandy line hammering accident, he could draw old Ken butter case into joining his band.

The next 30 years passed in a world cartography was all but forgotten. As lips suck jabs band, known variously as the crumpled ships, the amnesiac lane octet, lips suck jab and his big Allah minium kettle, shimmying in pond, the Norwegian Hooters or go wild with lips suck jab on the mullet babies toured endlessly through Sumatra, Java, Borneo, New Guinea, Timo and the Yukon. There were shows virtually every night of the week in hotels, dance halls, casinos, scout hut, community centers, bingo parlors, caves, factories, deserted mineshaft and temples. lacquered gets cluttering recording contracts followed the band everywhere. broadcasters from the burgeoning Dutch East Indies Radio Corporation were forever dragging the band into studios batter case took up the bassoon and the armed Martino in addition to his favorite accordion, although he was never able to play either of them with much conviction. This is a deal ended on the January the 14th 1959. When disaster struck. The band builders the authentic sound of geriatric slobbering were booked to play at the palace, a nightclub in Selwyn heart by the banks of the Macmillan which would become the in place to be for the local population of trappers, Mounties card shops, detectives, rustlers and circus performers. The journey from Borneo had been exhausting, and half the band had contracted Dengue fever. Lips suck jab himself was under investigation by the Jarvan secret police following his involvement in a stamp collecting scam, and had become convinced rightly that agents pursued him at every step. Indeed, on the night in question 11 Jarvan playing CloudMom were loitering in the snack bar at the fopp Palace ready to make an arrest. As if this were not trouble enough, batter cases accordion had been sabotage by thugs employed by a rival Sumatran jazz combo. As soon as he played an F sharp explosives secreted within the instrument would detonate blasting the accordion, its player and anyone and anything else within a 500 yard radius to smithereens.

By a quarter to midnight when the band would do to begin their set. The fopp Palace was packed the Jonathan's skillfully disguised as a group of Lithuanian business executives. I'd found out from the snug bar and taken up strategic positions around the stage and at the exit. Never want to tolerate sickness lips suck jab had summarily dismissed the dang stricken members of the group, and was busy rehearsing for locals in a back room. None of the callow Yukon youth had ever played a musical instrument before, but so awe inspiring was lit sock jabs tuition, that by the time the lights went down, Beth skip Trump and Deb felt confident enough to attend the banjo, tuba sackbut and kettle drums respectively. The locals gave them a rousing cheer, which was only slightly muted when they were followed on stage by butter case and the other two long serving band members whose names we may learn later, the seven of them started to bash out a scorching opener designed to set the scene for the arrival of their leader. You will be pleased to learn that batter case played the bassoon on this number. The Deadly accordion rested behind him on a rather intriguing stall carved entirely from the task of Are wall and engraved with scenes of piracy and racketeering. He had received this piece of scrim Shandy, from a bolton mustard merchant after a concert in Veta in 1946. Towards the end of the number, lip sack jab made his way towards the stage as he paused to screw the last bolt into his incandescent metal head harness. Four of the javelins pounced before he knew what had hit him. The cornetist was gagged, handcuffed and frogmarched out by our side exit into the wintry Selwyn night. The rest of the job and detectives join them, and they hurry down to the banks of the Macmillan, which was of course, entirely frozen over. hastily lacing up there I escaped, and muttering incomprehensible messages into their walkie talkies, the agent careered across the river at breakneck speed, narrowly avoiding bashing lips suck jams head into an ice trapped tugboat in midstream. Once they've made it to the other side, they put the cornetist back on his feet, and having removed their skates ordered him to march with them for miles to the airfield where their biplane is waiting as they set off Midnight's struck. Back at the fopp Palace, the band were in disarray. deprived of their leader, they were improvising desperately. Butter Kate and the spinet just chock bang. We're trying to hold things together by running through some of the older numbers. But the four new players were having trouble with the smooth non passages, and the increasingly drink sudden crowd began to make ominous hooting noises. Lip suck jabs, abduction had been carried out so swiftly and efficiently. The band was still not aware of it. They assumed it was some new crowd pleasing Crick, which we had not told them about, which would have been in character. But a case had never forgotten the time the bandleader had had himself wrapped in sail cloth and carried on to the stage by a team of frogmen. authentically encrusted with whelks and stinking of ooze. The band had been as repelled as the audience until of course, one of the frog mentor a small hole in the cloth, inserted the Cornett into it, and the wily Korean bandleader let fly with a majestic solo rendition of chutney on my spat, which brought the house down.

If it was up to such a trick tonight, the batter case he was leaving it a bit late. Several of the burlier elements of the crowd were polishing their seminars and distributing cuddles. If there was not to be a riot, drastic action was called for. At half past midnight, the cartographer brought a turgid rumba to an end, with a high pitched squeak on the bassoon. He whispered to skip to relinquish the tuba and passed him the accordion, telling him to do his best. Then, leaving chalk bag on the Strongsville to muster some sort of performance out of the Hicks, he fled the stage on some pretext and dashed like a maniac throughout the fopp Palace seeking the cornetist. The eagle eyes which had Mac Sumatra three decades before, did not fail him now. Within minutes, he had come upon lip sack jabs, corn it abandoned between the side exit and the riverbank. From there, it was a small matter to ponder some connection with the telltale skate marks reaching across the ice. Butter case ran back to the top pallet cloakroom and taking advantage of the attendance absence, stole a pair of snowshoes, delaying it to peer into the dance hall, and see that skip was at least holding the accordion the right way up. He set off across the ice, hoping to heaven that he was not on a false trail. As he clambered up on the opposite bank, he was flattened by the force of an enormous explosion behind him. Alas, skip had hit a bum note, an F sharp on the intro to like call her Pope Pius the fourth. The world of Sumatran jazz would never recover from the loss

But the case eventually made it as far as the airstrip but of course he was too late to catch up with lip sack jab and his Jarvan abductors. Luckily, an aeroplane was taxiing ready for takeoff and butter case was able to attract the pilots attention and get himself a board in the nick of time. The pilot, excuse me.

Frank Key  15:50
The pilot was an outlandishly mustachioed Dutch hotelier named Vander Wargo, who had been prospecting sites for leisure complex. On the long flight back to hit Lou in gelderland. He bought butter case insensible, with a minute Lee detailed description of his schemes, liberally illustrated with financial prospectuses, architectural diagrams, flowcharts trilingual press releases and very hurried maps. As he brandish these in the exhausted accordionist face vanderwaal go repeatedly let go over the controls. And it's something of a miracle that that he eventually brought the Arab airplane safely into land. As a reward for listening to all this gibberish, but the case was invited to stay at the hotel as Gary mentioned, on the outskirts of hedge Lew, although he intended only to stay for a few days, but a case ended up spending the rest of his life there. With lip sack jab incarcerated in a job and prison and the rest of the band dead. He felt understandably reluctant to continue his musical career with all that would be involved forming a new band, buying a new accordion, and so on. For a week or two, he moved about vanderwaal goes to state nauseated by the banana colored interiors aghast at the collection of tubular titanium furniture, outrage that hideous Google's which filled every room, each one monstrously ugly in itself, the effect multiplied by sheer quantity. Every day, it seemed that guerriers hotelier would arrive home with yet more OBJ as he called them, and target his mustachios as he agonized over where to place them to heighten their effect. To make matters worse, he insisted on consulting but a case over these decisions, dragging him from room to room to contemplate whether a cup glass pink squared on a green satin cushion sewn with Dr. Monte lozenges would look better in the window of the Billy. Excuse me, I'm going to read that sentence again. To make matters worse, he insisted on consulting butter case over these decisions, dragging him from room to room to contemplate whether a cut glass pink squid on a green satin cushion sewn with Dr. Monte lozenges would look better in the window of the billiard room, or set on a nest of tables in the corner of the scullery. Vanda Wargo was generous and affable, and butter case was impossibly polite. But the strain of these daily consultations was eventually too much. And the house guests came down with a nervous malady. Vanda Wargo employed a team of paramedics to give him round the clock care as he slowly recuperated one of these Tyler's medicals, put it to the hotelier that what the patient needed was some activity, nothing too strenuous, but something that would make him feel youthful. aware that in his younger days, that's a case that had something to do with maps, or with one map At any rate, the mogul offered his guest the position of Chief cartographer Vander Wargo hotel and leisure complex International, Hulu limited.

As we all know, butter case took up the post. between 19 860 and 1966. He established his reputation One of the greatest cartographers of the century. From his unutterably tasteless room in vanderburgh goes mansion. He sent teams of mapmakers out across the globe to draw up sketches for his employers increasingly grandiose schemes. constantly in touch with his juniors via Telegraph, he would urge them on to evermore adventurous cartographic innovations. regularly, the postman would deliver rolls of blueprints and sketches to the mansion, and Vanda Wargo himself would scamper up the staircase to his friend's room, occasionally knocking over one of the lamentable ornaments in his haste. The two of them would pour over the materials chuckling with glee and knocking back tankards of who, but then the hotelier would withdraw and leave butter case alone to work. outward come the gigantic sheets of waterbath paper, and the pencils of every conceivable color their points as sharp as ducks, and days, weeks, or months later, the map would be finished and sent by pneumatic tube down to vanderburg. Den where the hotelier would weep with joy, as he unrolled the paper and opened it to his gaze.

On the fourth of August 1966, Ken basketcase, tripped over a pee wit while strolling in the mansion gardens. He fell headlong, cracked his skull and died instantly. That morning, he had put the finishing touches to a new map of Sumatra, unaccountably he had quite forgotten to show the location of Berlin being

and that's the end of accidental death of 12 cartographers number eight Ken butter case, I never wrote Episode Number 127 and nine to 12. Although illustrations of all 12 accidental deaths of all 12 cartographers were the theme of the 1992 hooting yard calendar. A fantastic item, which if you find a copy on on eBay, we'll probably set you back a pretty penny. There were three no four hooting yard calendars in the 1990s of which accidental deaths of 12 cartographers was one there was another one called something about the the golden golden days of the bulges spinny variety theatre and another one which was An Illustrated Guide to fangs in the mist by chlorine Winslow. Actually, there were five there were five because there was there another one called Planet of the crumpled, Jesuit. And all of those were what came out in the 1990s. And there hasn't been a hooting yard calendar in the 21st century, but perhaps there should be. The reason I'm babbling on about calendars. And the 20th century is because having finished reading that story, I don't have any other new material for this week, or at least not with me. However. hooting yard fans may be aware that I've been this year I've been writing a daily essay of about 1000 words on the hooting yard website. Which project I didn't think would last beyond about the third or fourth of January. But we're here we are in the middle of May. And it's still going strong. There's been 1000 words or so every day. Most Recently and which I will probably read next week on the show on dumbing down, which is my plan to dumb down hooting yd on AFI na, AFI na being the final, mythical hallucinatory destination of Arthur Rambo. Rambo decided to go to fnr while on his deathbed, in fact, on the day before he died, so obviously he never made it to half an hour, but I decided I would try and work out where it was. And go there. So you can hear about that next week. And I might also tell you about Alfred Ilg. It was a friend of Rambo's. Very good name, Alfred illed. And so that might be coming up next week. But otherwise, that's really the end of this week show. I recommend that you go to the hooting yard website or hooting yard.org. And while you're there, please send me some money. That's always a good thing to do. Because we don't get paid for doing this show on on resonance, none of the resonance program makers is paid. So when you finish giving me money, then you can head over to the resonance website and send money to resonance as well. Just empty your pocket or indeed your bank account. And give us all you've got or at least a pittance every little helps. So that's that for this week. I will be back next week as promised with hooting out on the air. And in the meantime, I hope you have a very morally uplifting and instructive week. Bye bye
