Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And we're it not for the lower order of spirit brains, there would be comparatively few drunkards, gamblers, adulterers, fornicators, murders, and suicides. It is they who excited man's animal senses by conjuring up alluring pictures of drink and gold and sexual happiness. By the aid of the higher type of spirit brains, I have been enabled to perceive the atmosphere surrounding drinking dens and brothels, full of all kinds of bestie or influences from Emma mentals, who are new or men by presenting to their minds all kinds of attractive tableau, to the earthbound spirits of drunkards and libertines, transformed into horas of the sub human sub animal order of phantasms, things with bloated nude bodies, and pigs faces shaggy bears with fulsome, watery eyes, mangy dogs, et cetera. And that's from Elliot O'Donnell's book, by ways of ghost land. Excuse me. Meanwhile, I read somewhere. I read somewhere recently, an article claiming that Dobson the out of print pamphleteer had pretensions to being some sort of L Ron Hubbard figure. This is a terrible slur on Dobson who, if not exactly saintly, was by no means a money grubbing charlatan. It is true that he wrote a guide to life in titled Dobson ethics, and devised a personality test with which he would attempt to entice passers by on street corners. But there the similarities end matches he might have wanted to. Dobson was never able to buy a small fleet of ships and spend years sailing the oceans with a private Navy, the sea organization as a tax avoidance scheme. The Dobson attic personality test survives only in fragmentary form, for the simple reason that most of those invited to take it. Drugs did a piece of blubbering inanity and tore it to shreds. Today's credit, the pamphleteer did not condemn such focus appa states who should be dominated, threatened and shunned. Instead, he looked on sadly as the torn up scraps of yet another uncommitted test, uncompleted test sorry, fell to the ground, only to be picked up by the howling winds and carried off, fluttering away in the air. He would walk until they disappeared, and then crunch home, fix himself a cup of piping hot tea, and sit at his s crosswalk to devise more questions. It is worth pointing out that, as with so much else, Dobson Dobson dogs sonian. The personality test was a fleeting fad, and he soon moved on to pastures new. Years later, he penned a pamphlet entitled A recantation of Dobson ethics, which has the dubious distinction of having sold precisely nil copies. If he's now out of print. It is estimated that there were 200 questions in the original Dobbs genetics personality test. Of course, of these only seven have survived. As an act of historical curiosity, you may wish to answer them. So if you'd like to get a pen and paper and scribble down your answers to the following questions. One, complete the following sequence thumping headache, spin ik creosote Viper vyper Helen Shapiro dot dot dot two Do you prefer flip top lid to a twist off cap. Three.

Four, do you tremble in the presence of coathangers? Five, manna from you toxic women are from Didcot. True or false? Six. The best thing to do with a plastic base and full of bird feathers is what? Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about l Ron Hubbard?

Want to read out now the text of a paper given at the 15th International Symposium of potato chronometry held in olm in the spring of 2006. Helsinki Alma Helsinki, all room. That was the question faced by our colleagues on the steering committee, when wrestling with the problem of where to hold this ar 15 symposium, and I mean wrestling for various how the matter was eventually decided, winter bag represented the old mites, and our Fang, that Helsing keisters and they fought about each around of which was of course timed by a potato clock. In round one winter bag came out on top, making use of a butterfly reverse crucifix Lady of the Lake and octopus hold round to saw him further the cause of the Almighty with some decisive inverted facelock camel clutches, Tiger find crucifix armbars, a chicken wing, breath, choker, and a Tongan death grip. It looked as if our symposium was certainly headed for this fair German city. But in round three, our Fang rallied with a 200 coke lift and Argentine leg lock, spinning toehold, sharpshooter claw hold front transitory stretch plumb pole river plunge mount scoop and pump handle. He pushed home his advantage in round four with a tilt a whirl and that tree of Whoa. Winter bag got his breath back, however, and in the final round won the match with a fishhook sunset flip Texas cloverleaf Gauri special Fujiwara armbar hammerlock sitting double chicken wing Anaconda vise a wheel barrow and hands of palm It was a while over and the symposium was headed for all and here we are. There has never been a better time to sing the praises of potato chronometry in a world threatened by bird flu, climate change, the depletion of oil reserves terrorism, poverty war, David Blunkett and fundamental isms of every stripe, we may yet have faith in the simple potato. A generation ago in the doom dot the evils of 1968 the call was for power to the people had those naive revolutionaries called for power to the potato, things would be very different today. So potatoes as we know have power. Which of us here in this splendidly appointed Conference Center in room has not at one time or another, taken two common galvanized nails, three alligator clip wire units, that is alligator clips connected to one another with wire, two short pieces of heavy copper wire, a simple low voltage led clock unit and two potatoes. obtained a simple led clock unit that functions from the power of a one to two volt button type battery, opened the battery compartment to remove the battery noted that there is a positive and a negative terminal point where the battery was installed, identified the potatoes as number one and number two, inserted one nail in each potato inserted one short piece of heavy copper wire in each potato, placing it as far from the nail as possible, used one alligator clip stroke wire to connect the copper wire inserted in potato number one to the positive terminal in the clock unit. Then used one alligator clip stroke wire to link the nail in potato number two to the negative terminal in the clock unit. Use the final alligator clip stroke wire to link the nail in potato number one to the copper wire in potato number two. And finally, with no little sense of triumph, set the clock ticking which of us has not harnessed the power of the potato to control time.

The history of potato clocks is the subject of Dobson's magnificent pamphlet on the history of potato clocks. Sadly, it is out of print. Those of you lucky enough to have read it will know that it caused a good deal of controversy among the experts sharply dividing the world of potato chronometry into two hostile camps. Broadly speaking, there will be potato lists who held that the defining characteristic of the potato clock is it potato lists vying with the clock guests who are wedded to the idea that the keeping of accurate time is the crux of the matter. Dobson himself refused to take sides, arguing with some arrogance that both potato and clock are equally important in what it means to be a potato flock. This assertion itself led to a slew of letters and articles in the specialist press, accusing Dobson of preposterous arrogance. The pamphleteer funded one anonymous correspondent claims that he knows what it is like to be a potato clock. This is Aaron's twaddle potato clock is made of potatoes, and a few bits of wire and other things. Dobson is simply a floored by paid and one whose brain is obviously not working properly. Where does this leave us? We stand at the dawn of a new millennium one in which the potato clock will have a decisive part to play. Even if we do not yet know with any precision. What that part will be is our perception of time as measured by potatoes qualitatively different, better or worse than other methods of keeping time. More or less attuned to nature, to the cycle of the seasons, to the sun and the moon and the stars, to the tides of the sea and the life cycle of beings both tiny and huge. We need to answer these questions with some urgency. And that is why I propose that we storm the gates of all those remote and secretive buildings where so called atomic clocks with their pinpoint accuracy at tick tocking away and we rent them from their fixtures and stamp them a bit under our big boots. And we replace them all with potato clocks. I for one foresee our triumph. Thank you. My next lecture will take place in the pie shop annex where I will be addressing the exciting topic measuring distance by laying celery sticks end to end.

And I just like to mention here that I'll shortly be launching an exciting new hooting yard fundraising effort, in which you'll be able to become a patron of hooting yard. And as a patron you'll receive three or four times a year, a little printed pamphlet, exclusive to patrons in the post. You can actually already sign up to this, we've got to do is go to the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org. And there's a little button where you can where you can take out a you can make a donation, but the patrons are the repeat monthly donations. And if you donate a minimum of 10 pounds a month, you'll be a patron and you'll be able to receive your three or four exciting exclusive printed pamphlets. If that sounds like a lot of money 10 pound a month for hooting yard. Consider that following his recent price rise, I worked out that if you buy the Guardian newspaper every day, it costs over 50 pounds a month now. So bear that in mind and just think for less than a quarter of the price of the guardian. You could become a patron of hooting guard. So go to hooting yard.org and it's called a subscription at the moment, but I'm going to be changing that to patron and do a repeat monthly payment. And I'll be forever grateful and perhaps I won't starve to death. Anyway. I went a roaming on a bright morning, and I roamed for about half an hour when and I had Rome for about half an hour when the sun was obscured by the during black clouds and a downpour began. I pulled up the hood of my Westphalian storm jacket and ploughed on, though I knew not where I was going. Excuse me.

Excuse me. I'm gonna start reading this again. I went to roaming on a bright morning, and I had Rome for about half an hour when the sun was obscured by during black clouds and a downpour began. I pulled up the hood of my Westphalian storm jacket and ploughed on, though I knew not where I was going. My head was filled with quiz questions to which I had no answers. For it was a football quiz. And I know so little of football. In which year did Manchester City goalkeeper but Troutman break his neck in the FA Cup final. Who were hang bonk grin and Lynn Zun son, was it wise to pick both hodell and uanl for the England squad. I tussle with these perplexities as I wandered off the muddy path by the canal and into a soggy field. Luckily, the field was empty of cows, for I am terrified of cows and always have been. They seem so patient across the field, and came upon a ramshackle collection of abandoned farm machinery, perching on what might once have been a tractor piston before rust ignored any utility from it. I took a pastry from my pocket and nibbled at it cautiously. There were a few books on the shelves of the derelict cottage in which I grew up. And the only one I remembered was caution with pastries and other tips for the neurasthenic, peasant, lavishly illustrated compendium of advice that I've learned by heart and followed diligently all my life long and it has been a long life seven or eight decades now. None any better or worse than the other. Swallow swallowing the last flecks of pastry after about half an hour's cautious chewing. I stood up and looked around me. The rain was petering out into a drizzle. I headed off towards the west towards trees for I had heard that beyond the trees. There was a brand new government one stop shop. My understanding was that a one stop shop would cater to all my needs. For that is what it probably May student a brochure that had been tossed onto my garden path by the postal delivery person. I wanted insignia desperately something I could pin to my hat. The trees when I reached them were dense, many of them rotting all of them dripping with recent raindrops. I leaned against the large or it might have been a sycamore and lit my pipe. I decided to skirt the trees rather than to plunge recklessly through them. And that is how I ended up knee deep in a bug. There was a stone in the bog and our eyes met. I wanted to be the stone and the stone wanted to be me. We looked at each other intently for the longest time. We were still there in the bog staring at each other when Knight crashed down and stars glittered in the sky. Such is life.

When you wish upon a star, you are almost certainly wasting your time. If you surely not sensible to hope that your feature can be in any way influenced by a piece of burning rock hurtling around in space billions of miles away. Considering such behavior objectively, it would not be unkind to say that you are deluded, if not completely bonkers. In a cruel age, you would probably have been locked up or worse. One can imagine perhaps some medieval person standing in a field staring up at the night sky, peering at a faraway star, then closing their eyes briefly, the better to concentrate, a mumbling a wish. Suddenly, there is the sound of galloping hooves and a detachment of horsemen from principle gente O's palace comes to a halt in front of the wishing peasant. Heil peasant of the night, their leader might say an evil smile playing about his thin lips. What are you about? The peasant, knowing how dangerous the princes henchmen are dissembles, muttering something about collecting night potatoes, or some otherwise innocent deed. The captain of the horsemen cackles and his companions laugh too, as if they're sharing a joke. The prince will be mighty pleased, says the captain wiping spittle from these chain with the sleeve of a rich purple tunic made of cloth sell expensive. The peasant gasps at the sight of it. You must come with us and tell the prince that his realm has been blessed with potatoes in the sky. There is a menacing pause for you we're looking up at the firmament were you not rather than down in the muck with potatoes are usually found. The peasant knows he is in trouble now and tries to flee. But he is captured, taken back to principle generaciones Castle and chained up in an Uber yet so harsh. The princes orders to his henchmen make sense, as he does not want his temporal power threatened by a peasantry who owe allegiance to stars, planets, other heavenly bodies, or indeed to any system of supernatural Hocus Pocus that he cannot control. sanctuary rigga is poo pooed and are more enlightened age but not everywhere. There are still lands where the modern equivalent of principal Gen CEO will have a Stargazer stoned to death or chop off their head. Over here we have taken a therapeutic route. And nowadays, if you stand in a field at night, wishing upon a star, you're likely to be picked up by social services and given counseling until you retrieve closure, the inference is the same. However, by relying upon distant, twinkling lights in the sky as a guide to your future. You are clearly a Loon. When you wish upon a star in the modern age, it is best if you use the word staff figuratively. It is quite acceptable for you to wish upon such stars as Kevin Costner, or Mel Gibson, Celine Dion, or that shantelle girl for big brother. This is seen as not only acceptable and safe, but it's positively encouraged. Indeed, I get the impression that it's becoming compulsory. And my wish, bring back principal Gen CEO and his henchmen and set them to do their worst celebrity pap magazine.

Health warning now. This is from Louie Levine's fantastica a classic survey on the use and abuse of mind altering plants. A man who from youth had become accustomed to drinking exaggerated quantities of tea and had reached a daily consumption of 30 cups suffered from symptoms of anemia, suffocation, and hallucinations. So, don't drink too much tea. And here's another quotation This is from Myrtle read the spinster book. There seems to be no good reason why a man's way of sharpening a pencil is any better than a woman. It is difficult to see just why it is advisable to cover the thumb with powdered graphite and expose that useful member to possible amputation by a knife directed uncompromisingly toward it, when the pencil might be pointed the other way, the risk of amputation avoided and the shavings and pulverized graphite left safely to the action of gravitation and centrifugal force. Yet the entire race of men refuse to see the true value of the feminine method. And indeed, any man would rather sharpen any woman's pencil than see her do it herself. So there you go, sharp pencil sharpening, pencil sharpening etiquette, or the different ways men and women sharpen pencils. And of course, let's not forget that men are from you toxic, and women are from Didcot. And that's the end of this week's show. Just a reminder, if you'd like to become a patron of hooting yard, please go to putting our.org and take out a subscription. And that would be very, very nice if you would if you've enjoyed the show and all the other shows and bla bla bla bla bla and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
