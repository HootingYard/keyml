Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. If you were listening last week, which I'm sure you were, you may recall that there was some discussion in last week's program of antipathy and the 60s pop folk sensations, the seekers. And I was very careful to differentiate the seekers from the new seekers. The seekers are absolutely or were absolutely fantastic. Where does the new seekers, I can't really use the words I would like to describe them on a family show, or even a family radio station. Because it would contravene broadcasting rules where he used those words. But anyway, I gave my opinion long held, that it's the mark of a civilized person, that they can name all four of the seekers. If asked, in the same way that you don't need to really think if someone says name The Beatles, you say, you know, john, Paul, George, Ringo, and Yoko, you don't really need to think about it. And I've long held the view with justification that civilized people can name the seekers. Anyway, after the show, after the show was broadcast, I received a letter and I'll read it to you now. Dear Mr. Key, I have long been an avid listener to your witterings. But this is the first time I have felt compelled to write to you. My name is Keith Potter. Last week, two days short of my 81st birthday, I learned that I share my name with one of the seekers, the antipathy and folk pop sensations of the 1960s with whom you seem to be over familiar. I found it surprising that nobody had ever pointed out to me that I shared my name with Keith Potter of the seekers. But there you go, dentist dentists as they used to say, in Latin or dog Latin or Pig Latin or one of the Latins if memory serves, and it may not given my advancing years. The reason I'm writing to you is Board of concern. As I said, I have been listening to your stuff for a long time. And I have until now considered you perhaps the most sensible writer on the planet, if not in the known universe. Many years the time I have whacked my ancient mother on the head to rouse her from her scooper. Just so I could recite to her yelling as loudly as possible into a trumpet, one of your matchless sentences, so full of wisdom and moral rigor. But now, I'm sad to say, I fear you may be teetering on the delusional you think to think that every civilized person knows the names of the seekers. I pride myself on being an incomparably civilized man, in spite of recent unfortunate piddles stains on my trousers. And until last week, I did not know the names of any of the seekers. It's only because of the far fetched coincidence that I share Keith Patras a name that I now know one of them. And yet I'm quite well informed about 1960s pop sensations in general, having committed to memory the Bernard Levin list. Indeed, when I'm not shouting your sentences at my ancient Mother, I'm shouting that list at her in short bursts into her ear trumpet in an attempt to stimulate her catastrophic Lee fading brain integuments. I might need to observe however that should you persist with the absurd fancy that everybody knows the seekers. My mother appears on mental Colossus in comparison. This could be merely the top of a slippery slope for you, Mr. Key. I know that you also seem to believe that everybody can reel off the name is john paul, George and Ringo plus, Yoko berry without thinking, What is the name of heaven you bounce blathering on about

Frank Key  05:00
john paul, without the comma in between is the name of a pair of late 20th century pontiffs of the holy apostolic Roman Catholic Church. As for the other three names, George Ringo and Yoko, in that context, they're, frankly incomprehensible and you've obviously made two of them up. I screamed all five nines repeatedly into my mother's ear trumpet, and the dear woman show got a flicker of recognition. This for me is the acid test. Speaking of the ancient Mrs. Potter, I must end this letter now to go and attend to her. The cup affixed under her chin to collect her drawer is almost full, so I must empty it into the brewed VAT in the pantry. Please try to get a grip Mr. Key, it will be a tragedy if you lose your marbles ever yours, Keith Potter, not a seeker.

I also received another letter on a completely unrelated subject from Carlo Randall, who said, Dear Mr. Key a few weeks ago, I spent a grim evening playing some kind of Lovecraft based collaborative board game with friends. Tiny plastic fingers moving about on a dark board over printed in near black ink, the prolix and apparently arbitrary rules printed not in a handy booklet, but on large floppy sheet tacked to the inside of the presentation box lid, the various stacks of dark reprinted hazard card, menace cards, threat cards, Jeopardy cards and so on. The strange anomaly of the taxis by which one's avatar might whisk about the region's gloomy map scape. The massiveness of the dice and their propensity to scatter the scrawny lightweight playing pieces from their assigned places. The confusing industry indistinguishability of those playing pieces, which meant one frequently expanded or one's half understood strategic knouse on moving the wrong character, frustrating some ultimately crucial aspect of our Gracie early paced campaign to resist or repel the old ones. The swiftly escalating despair that a the game could not be won by the human players, because the resources of the game, our opponent, were so lavishly stacked against us, and B, that it would nevertheless take a troublingly long time before our inevitable crushing defeat was confirmed. In that respect, I suppose it was a truly lovecraftian experience. I remember my avatars being obliged to sidle down a kind of sewer pipe from Arkham to donek. or similar to forestall some inexpressible catastrophe, which was about to be visited on the region by a tiny plastic monster, which had it tumbled from one cornflakes packet in childhood would have been flicked dissolved orally into the pedal been without a second glance. We lost the game itself was declared the winner, but I don't want to give the impression that nobody enjoyed it. Our host was queueing with delight all evening. Yours shuddering Lee, Carlo Randall and ag

there was an occasion which I think is become legendary or legendary. When john peel, played, teenage kicks Bobby undertones and liked it so much that he immediately played it again, which is one of those things you're not meant to do on the radio. And there's a sentence in that letter from Carlo random which I enjoyed so much, that I'm going to read it again. And I think you know, listen to this sentence again, and savor it, because it truly is a superb sentence. I remember my avatars being obliged to sidle down, I kind of sewer pipe from Arkham to dunnage. or similar to forestall some inexpressible catastrophe, which was about to be visited on the region by a tiny plastic monster, which had it tumbled from one's cornflakes package in childhood, would have been flicked dissolved early into the pedal bin without a second glance.

I'm calling seven who tirelessly produces the show every week for little or no reward. just asked me if that was a real letter as if, as if I'd make anything up. But it is true that sometimes I do make up letters from fictional readers. But I would like to assure you all that that's a real letter from a real reader. Even though Carla Randall is an anagram of his or her name. But yes, john, that was a real letter. I do receive them from time to time. And anyway, let's move on. For this final show before the summer break. I'm very glad john earlier reminded me that we're not here next week or the week after or the week after that will throughout August and the beginning of September. Otherwise, I would have struck a follow on figure sitting on the step outside the resonance studio wondering where everyone had gone. But now I won't do that I'll do something else instead. here's, here's something else. Why Do Fools Fall in love? It's a question that has taxed the minds of great thinkers throughout history. A notable investigation of our own era by lineman in 1956 was perhaps hampered by his extreme youth and that of his research assistance. It is true that some breakthroughs in the advance of human knowledge have been made by youngsters. But in matters of the heart, we may prefer to rely on the doddery and the decrepit, who are likely to have a mask valuable experience in the field. Few are as doddery and decrepit as in his bed. Our head, who it is thrilling to learn is that long last on the brink of publishing his findings, our head has been working on this stuff for years holed up in his top secret laboratory somewhere high in the Swiss Alps. Some decades ago, he provided a glimpse into his working methods in an article for the rigorous and high minded scientific Bulletin of love, which I will read out to you without permission. In order to find out why Fools Fall in love, we must first obtain two fools. The easiest way to do this would be to go to crack in town and drag off the street and bundle into the back of a van. The first couple of fools we encounter. So that's what I did. It's a very long way from crack in town to my top secret laboratory somewhere high in the Swiss Alps. So I placed both falls into an induced coma for the duration of the journey by van crane, forklift truck ship, another forklift truck, another van, another train, and finally funicular railway. I installed the phones in a sealed but spacious chamber, designed especially for my purposes. before bringing them out of their comas, I did a thorough investigation of their brains, prodding at them with various instruments to ascertain the precise degree of foolishness

Frank Key  15:05
Labor fools All right. I could not have been more pleased. So before waking them. I treated myself to a slap up dinner, the reeking goat milk kerlin unstarred eatery halfway down the mountain. The trough that night was filled with delicious pap and slots. And I mixed easily with the regular clientele of goat herds peasants and to book your Alpine invalid. Back in the lab after a postprandial smooths and a few games of ping pong with my hunchbacked assistant mango, I set to work. I injected both fools with a wake me up potion, and then retreated to my observation post outside the sealed chamber. After some minutes, the fools as scientifically predicted, fooled about I was so pleased, I had another slap up dinner, and other snooze and further games of ping pong with mango. On Valentine's Day, I introduced into the chamber a box of chocolates. The following year, I introduced a bunch of flowers. The third and most decisive intervention came on the next and Valentine's Day, when I placed in the chamber, a winged, chubby, naked, curly haired cat rabbit infant, armed with a bow and arrow, which hovered in the air above the fools. I have every confidence that true love will blossom within that sealed chamber. And when it does, I will be ready with my scanners and bloopers and probes and buzzers and pointy things and all sorts of Tip Top scientific paraphernalia, you could never begin to understand. Mango keeps it all polished to agree with his special rag. Owl had celebrated his 19th birthday 90th birthday last week, with an announcement that he would publish his findings on Valentine's Day 2018 or 2019 or add a push 2020. Next in this series, what becomes of the brokenhearted?

I'd like now to read quite an old piece, but one I've always enjoyed. And it's the moment is kind of buried in the archive of the all new look, hooting yard website. If you haven't seen the new look, go to hooting yard.org. And all will be revealed. It's the same old site basically. But it's got a brand new look. But one of the problems there's always teething problems with these things. And one of the problems is the index or the archive where you can search for things by date and subject seems to have vanished. And I have to wait for the boffin who does all the gubbins on them, who try to come back from abroad to sort it all out. But he's been very helpful in doing what he's done. And I can't thank him enough and so should you if you're a reader of the website, as well as a listener to the show. do go to the website where you can read all this stuff and buy some books and even make donations should you wish. Such a great website. It really is. I recommend it highly, but then I would, wouldn't I? Anyway, this piece first appeared on the French Canadian warbler Celine Dion's 40th birthday. And the same day incidentally was the 46th birthday of MC Hammer, who is frightened of hammers? I didn't make that up. If you go to the hootin God website and scroll down a bit to find this piece, you will see the word frightened of hammers in bold. So it's a hyperlink. And if you follow it, you can read why or just I don't know why, but you can read the MC Hammer is apparently frightened of hammers. Anyway, enough of all that I shall read on. This is called busta and rad board. There are some questions we can answer without hesitation, asked, What is your favorite website 100% of sensible people immediately shout, hooting yard of course, with unhinged and hysterical enthusiasm. Similarly, when asked in which school Book Depository, they would prefer the site of sniper's nest, an overwhelming number of would it be a Saturday reply, the Texas School Book Depository at 411 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas 75022317. Without a doubt, For my part, and in spite of the intervening decades, a question I can answer without even thinking is, what was your favorite Weekly Comic when you were tiny? Well, it was the hammer of Christ, and within it, the strip I most adored was Buster and rad bold. Each week I followed the adventures of the chirpy pair with my jaw dropped and drool flowing freely down my chin, my heart and pulse rate pounding desperately. It was through busta and rad board that I learned to read, and I am forever in their debt. They were in many ways and they all matched fictional pair. Buster was squat hissy and preening given to throwing fits, and always attired in a bright yellow duffle coat, and a little pointed wooden cap. He existed on a diet of chocolates, Swiss rolls, sprats, lettuce and untreated milk straight from the goat. We were never given a glimpse of the goat. But it was understood that it lived in a field a short walk across the verdant hills from busters house, and that its name was Buttercup. busta had more than one iron pail in which he would collect the milk, one painted red and the other one unpainted, and a third extra special pail that leaked and that he was always promising to mend but never did.

Buster had too many teeth crammed inside his mouth, certainly more than a nonfictional person would have, and some of them were sharpened into fangs. He liked to sit atop a rotating plinth and spin round and round and round until he was sick. I was always curious as to the engine which rotated the plinth. It bore a distinct resemblance to undersea drilling equipment I had seen either in real life or in catalogs. Although of course, nearly all of Buster and rad Bob's adventures took place on dry land, far from the sea. Buster was once or twice shown to be in possession of a pair of swimming trunks that were visible in pictures of his open wardrobe alongside a snorkel and an oxygen canister, but I cannot recall him ever wearing them. Buster had an owl as well as an goat. But the owl was also called Buttercup and Buster treated it cruelly often pelting him with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts throughout the impossibly long afternoons of his indelicate fictional summertime. The owl took revenge by regurgitating gobbets of semi digested stout or weasel on to busters pointed wooden cap, which we would then have to rinse clean under the village spigot. Doing so was always a risky business, for lumbering in the vicinity of the village that was the village wrestler, a hairy brute capable of tearing an anvil in half with his great hairy hands. Luckily for buster, the village wrestler was changed to a post next to the village spigot and he was blind. So usually it was possible to skip nimbly out of his reach, even though being squat Buster was not the most nimble of cartoon characters. Indeed, he was not nimble at all. He slouched and he trudged, and he often trailed one of his legs behind him as if he were a lame child. But this was just rascals. methi Buster pretended to be lame to digital small coinage from shopkeepers and the ground staff at the aerodrome, but most of them were wise to his tricks. in quite a few stories, Buster and rad bowed mooched around the aerodrome trying to enter the hangars, but they were invariably stymied by one circumstance or another, be the weather or early closing or an attack of killer bees, or a rusty padlock. Once they were about to step into an unguarded and unlock hangar when they were surprised by the ghost of Sylvia Townsend Warner, and fled screaming into the hills. Other literary phantoms haunted the comic strip from time to time for differing narrative purposes, and not always at the aerodrome. The Ghost of Emily Dickinson for example, hovers in midair outside the village shampoo list in several frames have a particularly exciting adventure, in which a toggle on busters duffle coat is discovered to be a smooth round fragment from the tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. Buster hires a broom to fight off the ancient Egyptian goons who come to reclaim the pharaohs toggle. the hiring of brooms sweeping brushes, dusters squeegees rags and other cleaning materials is one of busters hobbies, along with bell ringing stamp collecting, making fluted paper cupcake cases, pelting his owl with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts. First World War battle reenactments, tongue twisters, snakes and ladders playing songs from the fort margin Memorial dump LP on the glockenspiel, churning up froth in a pail. bandage sculpture, tic tac tacky talk, driving nails into mud idols subu to table football, poop tack class attack with ping pong, hopping about flapping his arms conjuring tricks, removing splinters from gashes, cardboard appreciation, amateur dramatics pencil sharpening scattering pins all over the place, bowling bowls and dishes and running a flea circus. I thought of Buster rather than ride borders a role model. Buster had nonchalance Atlanta. I felt the temper

Frank Key  27:32
already wit and peevishness. He was insouciance when one of his lungs collapsed. He smoked Jew tans. He sometimes wore his pointed wooden cap at a jaunty angle. He could hold his breath underwater for several very very tense minutes. He rattled about in a fantastic old jalopy. He had ambitions to be a bar g on an extensive system of canals. He was a dab hand with a banjo and not in a musical sense. Once he felled the blind brute fairly Dressler with a simple flick of his duffle coat cuff, and afterwards had the grace to polish the blind brute really dresses chain with a hired rag and his own homemade swore fieger. He does all that cocktail parties. He spat upon hissing coals. He tiptoed from rooms with a swish of elegance. He was off on a frolic of his own. rad board, by contrast, was a somewhat colorless character. And there is more of this piece, but too much I'm afraid for. I've timed this badly too much for this week's show. But you know the bit you've missed, you can always read on the hooting God website. But I think what I'll do to end tight giveaway for the summer break is read the very last sentence. And so for now, it shall remain further as much that Trumps gas research in my daily round. And right now I feel as I so often do, the call of the monkey and I must pick nets out of my hair and shoveled bananas down my throat, and swing from large to Sycamore in my large and Sycamore enclosure beyond the back garden. By the railway lines were hooting freight trains Thunder along the track carrying vast loads of pig iron to pig iron town, where I have never been and will never go for it is far far away and built entirely from pig iron. And that's all from this season of hooting. God. Bye bye
