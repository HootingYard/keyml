Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank Kate, and this is hosting yard on the air. If you drew a straight line between hooting yard and barges spinny and your pen wobbled slightly around the halfway mark. You might with a bit of luck hit the spot on the map where a century ago in a state of riotous abandoned sababa Diane karpin planted a wooden flagpole in the salt and tied to it a rudimentary cotton wind sock. In itself, this was an unremarkable act. It was after all, a century for wind socks, for hailstone detectors, Thunderbolt spindles, crampons, Tari and lit and wheeled enormities. Once had been a barren, cracked, overgrown with knots of furs, Bracken and scrog was now the stomping ground of a rum collection of fanatical experimenters, each with a vision of incandescent truth. Why this mob of boffins had chosen so unpromising a site, for the blooming of their delusions is far from clear. Although the proximity of hoons purple hills with their legendary aura may well be pertinent. Whatever the reason might be, each of these Palais de trousered, halfwits had arrived independently at this place of downpour and dizzy were chewed, scouring the landscape for the opportunities to test their Madcap theories. On a stroll across the land, the innocent observer would be beset by visions, both arcane and incomprehensible. amount of boulders died brilliant mode, surrounded by wisps of gossamer, nailed to crowd twigs and branches. The hole topped by a shallow basin into which would be dripped minute quantities of medicinal liquids and gooey ointments. passing a half mile further on, our traveler would find, rising ferociously from the ground as if they're very mad had spawned it. an impossibly intricate contraption of leavers, winches, spigots, pulleys and other goblins designed to uproot the tiniest specks of foliage and send them hurtling through the air into a massive pit, the walls of which were lined with battered gold plate on which had been engraved, selected verses from Leviticus another half mile, and are baffled Rambler would be forced to negotiate a series of shallow trenches dug according to a preordained scheme of Mad complexity, each one having implanted in it, a lozenge of gauze smeared with a foul undriven paste, capable of conducting electricity, the whole system of crunches and lozenges transforming the area, the area into a gigantic electric battery, powering an engine hidden inside a ramshackle heart of the battery's core, the purpose of which would presumably become apparent when its inventor deigned to unleash its demonic power. So surrounded by these fearsome contraptions karpin cotton wind sock, raised proudly aloft appeared as a little more than a sign of its creators poverty of spirit. Yet truth sat hunched and fretting just over the horizon. Can we doubt that karpin was well aware of the ramifications of his simple deed? Yes, we can. We must.

That was chapter one of House of curbs, which was published by the malice of forethought press, a sort of hooting out for runner in 1989. The year the Berlin Wall came down and his tractor to his when was hidden by a poultice of his own recipe. For years he had been preoccupied with the task of creating a universal pulses are clickable to all winds, boiled sores, cysts, Fern ankles and bled. The standard mustard plaster was to him a wretched thing, and he was determined to improve upon it. In his late teens, while apprentice to a rust scraping factory, he became obsessed with a future vision of apothecary shelves, groaning under the weight of jar upon jar of his magnificent invention. copings improved curative bandage paste. During a long tormented hours he spent in the factory cellar, scraping up patches of rust with a variety of huge utensils. These dreams came crowding into his head until there was room for little health. In his leisure hours, he brewed up numberless pop falls of disgusting concoctions. The early recipes were undistinguished or the germ of carbons related genius was present. He sought out rare and unlikely ingredients refining, refining, until there was hardly any matter, vegetable or mineral to be found in the village of aq, a sample of which had not been boiled to a paste in karpin huge iron pot. Yet, he was dissatisfied. Two decades have passed since first this mania had beset him, but all he had to show for it was a mountain of piles filled with the discarded results of over 10,000 experiments. despite warnings of Ruin and doom from his family karpin left the employee of the rust scraping factory and with his meager savings, enrolled for a chemistry course at the University of ik. In retrospect, we must be thankful that he ignored the frenzy by waving his of his kinfolk for it was at ik that the Kirpan of history was born. karpin proved to be the most brilliant student the university had ever taught. Day or night, he toiled that his studies several pages of scientific gibberish and mumbo jumbo has been excised from the manuscript, they provide a comprehensive outline of Kirpan studies. Listeners avid for the precise details, would be well advised to consult any standard chemistry textbook of the period and was awarded his final degree at the age of 53. As was the customer IQ, he squatted on his haunches, on top of podium hewn from baseballs, flags and pennants were dangled about his head, and from time to time, after sorry, flags and pennants were dangled about his head, and from time to time, after a verbal prod from the pre electoral karpin would catch one of the pennants in his teeth, and mash it with gumption. The role of honor was then read on one by one, the graduates drew themselves up right left down from their podia and prostrated themselves before the vice prime elector in abundance, who lacked the certificates of Conferment to their bodies with frayed ribbons. Slobodan karpin the man who had entered ik dismal and jaundiced was now a doctor of chemistry. He had had half his teeth extracted two years before.

Frank Key  09:18
At first the doctorate seemed to be a curse. So indefatigable was karpin in his search for an omnipotent poultice that the years of study, the widened intellectual horizons have done nothing to divert him from his chosen course. On the contrary, his mania had intensified. But where before, he would have been content to muck about with RS route and be borage, now, he sought to synthesize ever more preposterous substances, weird rare things, not easily found in his usual haunts. Seeking finance for anyone who would listen karpin set out on a Mad Odyssey. In his rucksack he carried retort Bunsen burners test tubes read Olympics and have double cramps. He strolled across opulent landscapes, hardly aware where he was going. Every so often some thrilling blob would cause him to halt unpack his rucksack and carry out a variety of ludicrous experiments. It was a hardships distance, and racked as he was by hunger and exhaustion. Turpin became a physical wreck. He found solace However, in the fact that his piteous frame erupted in enough salt, whens and blebs to make him his own best guinea pig. All the while he filled countless notebooks with the details of his experiments, taking off different substances as he wrenched the curative properties out of them. Devil starch, quite jelly Tasmanian guru spent bales Fred and then he was beckoned by the Arctic

Frank Key  11:44
House of terps chapter three is diary coping gave the following account of his first weeks in the Arctic Stavanger, I came upon a man who sold me a curious garment, which he claimed would protect me from the icy cold. It appeared to be made out of wood, although I cannot be certain there was a spring Enos about it, which is alien to most if not all of the word I have come across in my time. It also appeared to be rather thin for a piece of protective clothing. I handed my rucksack to this rum fellow who seemed to spit whenever he spoke, or not only spit, mind you, but let fly Gabi directly at my tremendous hairstyle. I digress. Handing my rucksack to him. As I say I clambered into this wooden overall, he demonstrated to me. Excuse me, he demonstrated to me at a wedge my knees and the cramped jointed sections of the legs. And similarly, how to adjust the purchase of the arms by twiddling a small metal flange located at either elbow. The hood came separately from the rest of the outfit, and was fixed in place by a devilishly complicated mechanism which locked and jammed as soon as I had done it. I have yet to discover how to dislodge it merging to one side to respond my Norwegian friend through the narrow slit provided for vision. I took my rucksack back from him and rummage through one of the pockets where money was dismayed to note that I had only just enough cash left to buy this suit onto Pio jolly drac tar to provide my passage northward. However, there was no time to waste, pressing some grubby coins into the man's hand. I bought him farewell and wheeling myself about turn causing my skeleton no little agony, I set off for the docks. Before I had gone 10 paces, I realized that it would be easier to carry my rucksack if I may be nailed it to my suit, chest level on my left side. Once again I wheeled about and headed for the Smithies shared I hadn't noticed earlier, I would surely find a hammer and nails there. To my surprise the man who looked up from Acme from his Advil was an old colleague of mine from Eric. We had studied latent phosphorescence together and burned gobs of clay. He did not recognize me in cases I was in wood. I blurted out a greeting to which he did not react. I had not realized that my suit was heavily soundproofed and if I wish to make myself heard, I had to scream at the top of my voice. An old man's lungs are not designed for such exertion. And I have had much need of soothing linctus in the weeks since I donned this apparel. But as I say, I did not realize immediately that my wooden cocoon was loath to admit sound, and I'm afraid that I interpreted my erstwhile colleagues bewilderment as evidence of Cretan ization. In patient to be away, I held myself to a hammer and some nails and rammed the rucksack home, rather to energetically as it happened, since I've managed to inflict a lesion in the flesh of my left upper torso, which still gives me some grip as I write. When I've worked out how to extricate myself from this warming, wouldn't affair, I must apply some experimental poultices 10 hours later, I arrived at the docks and met Enrico over the last few months I have come to know him, as well as I have ever known any of my fellow creatures.

Frank Key  16:08
In another age, perhaps they would have made a saint of him. He seems to be imbued with the sort of innocent goodness while associated with congenital idiots. And yet, he has a first class intellect. He has already command of 16 languages 11, of which I find utterly incomprehensible. Some of them seem to consist mostly of cost, groans, and a kind of strangulated croaking, which about an attractive is enough to wake the dead, and it's saved my bacon on more than one occasion. ringing out ghastly warnings of the approach of nameless terrors in the darkness, which otherwise would have fallen upon me and turn and torn out my throat or somesuch macabre business also Enrico tells me at any rate, splendid fellow in this icy nothing world. He has become my ears and eyes, my voice, my guide and helping hand were it not for him. I do not know how I would cope in this godforsaken place. In the evenings we sit hunched over the campfires, which Enrico sets with such elegance from the most unpromising materials. Never in all my years of I met another man I bought to transform a handful of slush into a raging inferno in under a minute. So naturally does this ability come to him that he greets my astonished inquiries with a sort of superior distain. We have had many interesting chat sat around the fire, and Rico belching and drooling in four or five languages simultaneously. I have learned to await the most pertinent point in his discourse, to interject with a barrage of ferocious sound shouting. If I spoke in the lower my friend would not hear a word I said, from inside my wooden world. And although my throat is read roar from the effort, I do not wish to deprive Enrico, of the benefits of convivial discussion and debate. We have ranged over all sorts of subjects, and though I fear at times that Enrico is something of a cynic, he has a plentiful store of anecdotes, which are both entertaining and instructive. I realized now how little I knew of life in a Norwegian dockyard,

Frank Key  19:19
House of terps chapter four. It was not until he reached that barren stretch device known as van drabs land that karpin realized he was alone. All along, and Rico had been a figment spawned by his feverish brain. It is a testament to his implacability that once this vile truth dawned on him, he was undaunted and trudged ever northward with renewed energy and not hold in the right leg of his gob caused a small patch of frostbite to waylay his ankle. But this only increased his sense of urgency. He had developed an intricate method of applying test policies to his wood encased body by feeding them in through the mouth slit and then shimmying and wiggling in a precisely coordinated manner, until we reach the required area. Last sandwiched between his flesh and the wood, the pulses could be gently tapped into place in order to pack snugly against his skin. extricating the test pieces was another matter, and the dreadful difficulty of doing so led Kirpan to invent and evaporating pulses by harnessing the illegible properties of some vermilion crystals he had discovered, wedged in a cravat. One day, while bent over his crucible mucking about with shards of Todd kerbin karpin was astonished to hear footsteps behind him, spinning around as fast as his job would allow. He was confronted by an enormous creature, almost twice his height, burbling, incomprehensible noises, which sounded at once, like the tinkling of glass, and the hooting of a foghorn had appeared as if from nowhere, his brain pulsating karpin wondered momentarily, if this preposterous being was yet another product of his febrile imagining another Enrico and yet as it continued to burble tinkling hooting, the truth of its called pore reality became evident. When adjusting his elbow flange, karpin held out his hand in greeting. The Beast was silent for a moment, then 12 wisps of cold blue fragrance around karpin bright body, beckoning him to follow. It turned on what could only roughly be called it healed on a walk all the way. hastily shoving his crucible and toddler shards into the rucksack. Kirpan set off in pursuit. The creature stayed well ahead of him, but once he had hit his stride, Kirpan was able to make a rudimentary study of its main features. It was a sort of cross between a penguin, an ape, and a trout, huge matted with rougher, it had a neck covered in silvery scales and strange black ringlets. One arm tapered to a fennel flap, while the other was thick and hairy, and ended in an almost humanoid hand. And as it waddled onward, its massive bushy tail thumped along the ground behind it, sending up flurries of thin snow, which settling covered its tracks. It was the most asymmetrical beast kerbin had ever seen. And yet, he was aware of a tremendous feeling of kinship with it. After all, it was the first life form he had come upon in 18, lonely months in the Arctic, and its presence overwhelmed him, he scurried after it with almost slavish eagerness.

Frank Key  23:30
Two weeks later, having tracked across the featureless expanse, the beast with its human acolyte in tow, arrived at a gaping pit, turning to face Kirpan, the ludicrous creature tinkled and hooted, then suddenly held itself over the edge into this icy more. The great chemist had no idea how to react paring over the rim, he could see nothing at all, nor did any sounds so forth from below. The compass nailed, his wrist was broken, so he was unable to ascertain whether or not he had reached the pole. Once again alone in the vastness karpin hummed his favorite him. Then, with a certainty born of dementia, he threw himself after the beast into the pit. As he plummeted his very being was invaded by BIP and from it, then he lost consciousness.

Frank Key  24:58
So that was half of half Have turps chapters one to four. And I will read chapters five to eight to you next week. The back cover of House of terps says the long awaited first volume in Frank keys important 26 part history of the house of Turks. In this introductory work, key outlines the build and the bind read the dust and the dribble. But welcome the drug, the true founder of the House of terps. His hair revealed for the first time vile and crumpled and stinking of ragwort not unlike the author himself. Do not hold this book over a precipice. It's not a book, of course, it's a booklet or a pamphlet, spineless pamphlet, published as OSI in 1989, long, long ago, and it was in an addition of 200 copies. So if you've got one, you're lucky person out and there's a there's an epigraph at the beginning, which variant important to me, I read it around the late 80s. And it informed me ever since it's from Dallas Wiebe, whoever he may be sure American short story writer. Anyway, in one of his stories, he says, when you have nothing to say, you write prose. And that was a great insight for me to realize that I have nothing to say. So I should write prose. And I've been writing prose more or less ever since. This is early pros. Not quite suitable for reading on the radio. I think it would be very, very different where to write it today. But 10 of historical interest, I think 27 years old, right? Yes. 27 years old. So that's actually it for this week. I'll be back next week with part two of House of terps Bye, bye.

Unknown Speaker  28:16
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers and wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course, I didn't go in but that day, I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
