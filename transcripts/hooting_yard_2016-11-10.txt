Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM, a resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. Blodgett had a certain militaristic cast his character, so when he was given command of a pocket battleship, it was understandable that he got slightly carried away. He fretted and fast over his epaulettes and other trimmings of his uniform to a somewhat embarrassing degree, so much so that he neglected more critical aspects of his duty, such as keeping a proper log. Vast it is that we do not have a reliable record of his one and only void. This was a time of gunboat diplomacy. And Blodgett mission was to anchor his ship in a faraway Bay, train his guns on the coast, and to threaten to blow the township there to smithereens unless certain conditions were met. All very straightforward, or it would have been had the ship not had for its navigator, a man who has lost his wits. This fellow's name was Trump Shaw, and it is a wonder that he still had the confidence of the Admiralty, for he had been bonkers for years. Instead of steering the ship towards the far away bait, Trump's your pored over his chart and barked instructions through a pneumatic funnel that led to the ship becoming encased in pack ice thousands of nautical miles away from its proper destination. There was no township upon which to train the guns, leaving Blodgett at a loss what to do, other than to preen his epaulette and other trimmings with a little brush. troubleshoot, meanwhile, was following his own demented star. He talked to pacing up and down the poop deck, shouting at the sky. icicles formed on the brim of his navigator's cap, but he seemed impervious to the cold. Not so the rest of the crew huddled below decks, wrapped in blankets and keeping their spirits up by playing board games and eating sausages. Blodgett kept his cabin using his logs or pad for doodling. He had lost radio contact with the admiral three weeks ago. There was nothing for it, but to sit the winter out and wait for the ice to melt. At this point, I expect the majority of listeners will be avid for further details of the board games on the sausages, and I will not disappoint. However, before dealing with those crucial topics, perhaps it's wise to say a few more words about Trump. Sure. His insanity was not in doubt. But what has never been established is whether he deliberately stranded the ship in Antarctic waters, or whether within the vaporous MK Merc of his mad brain, he honestly believed this ship was heading for that faraway Bay. There may be a clue in the words he was shouting the sky while pacing the poop deck. And by chance, we do have a record, albeit fragmentary of what they were, or some of them at least. By chance an airship packed to the gills with the very latest magnetic cylinder recording technology, past overhead one day, and some of Trumps all shouting was picked up by monitors and etched onto a cylinder preserved forever. If you get a special coupon for entry to the sound recordings rooms of the museum at or niak on the vog, you can listen to this bewildering caterwaul Dobson once planned a pamphlet on budgets void and transcribed part of crumpsall tirade, but abandoned the essay in favor of his justly famous bilgewater elegies. Thanks to Dobson though, we can reprint the shouting and gain an eerie insight into the crack brain navigator pacing the poop deck of that ice gut pocket battleship so many many years ago. Wheat bulgur wheat begins the Dobson transcription, wheat and gravel and sand and grit, powdered paste, paste in puddles, gravel and sand crimini pitch and tar and globules of black, black, black and blue cracking pods, squelching underfoot. pod views and glue pitted black olives in a jar pitted on black like a black pit,

crack bulgur wheat and cracking sand, black pudding, vinegar down your throat, malt and muck underneath in fast paced puddles of glue. It is difficult to know precisely what to make of this except to conclude that Trumps rule was completely off his head, and that charts and barked instructions to the crew notwithstanding, navigation was not uppermost in his mind. That being so we can get on to the more diverting business of the board games on the sausages as promised. The ship's cook was a follow of the dietary theories of can speak UGA, and that being the case there was little, if any animal flesh in his sausages, one might when munching occasionally sink one's teeth into a fragment of pig or go to a Starling, but only a tiny fragment, often so tiny as to go unnoticed. The cook made his sausages from an UGA approved compaction of mashed up turnips and marshland, reeds and grasses, leavened with some sort of secret curd. They came in two sizes, Jumbo and cocktail. Although the latter were not served on cocktail stick glue to EU girls stern prohibition of sausage piercing holes, even the very ones made by the average cocktail stick were anathema to the dietitian for reasons propounded in the preface to his magisterial Codex saucy audrianna even if you're not particularly interested in sausages, this book is a fantastic read, and I cannot recommend it too enthusiastically. I try to read a few paragraphs every day, much as some people dip daily into the Bible or into prudence foxgloves winsome thoughts for the dull witted. March of the ship's cargo hold was occupied by the cooked crates of sausage ingredients, and he was forever puffing and blustering about his Dally, needing the turnip and marshland reeds and grasses and secret curd, and occasional bits of pig and goat and styling into the sausage in which he took such pride inspecting every single one with a powerful microscope to ensure that it was free of even the most miniscule hole. And of course, the crew gobbled them down greedily at medieval times, both jumbo and cocktail varieties, for they had nothing else to eat. That's quite enough about sausages. Blodgett had made it a condition of his command of the pocket battleship, did it be stocked with lots and lots of board games, and so three entire cabins below the all up deck was stacked with them from family favorites such as Pluto kratt dentists potting shed, and to the Finland station to more obscure game like treat the dropsy with leeches, butcher shop railings and fictional athletes Bob Nick two volts cement running crack Challenge Cup Heat for on the rare occasions he popped his head into the cabin where the crew huddled together for warmth through that freezing polar winter. Blodgett was always pleased to see that they were kept fully occupied by one board game or another. The gang of sailcloth patches took particular pleasure in patch that sale of Fast and Furious yet at times slow moving game, involving equal measures of cutting and luck. The board itself represented a piece of sail cloth, and indeed was made of sail cloth, and the players took it in turns by throwing dice and moving their counters to pack up the various rips and renting the cloth with needle and thread.

Meanwhile, over in one corner of the cabin, Blodgett was sure to find the crow's nest men playing a sprightly game of groaning widow, a contest so fiendishly complicated, the lonely the superior brain pans of the crow's nest, men had a chance of understanding it. Other less bright sailors would watch gulping for hours as counters flew around the board spinners respond card pack consulted and little plasticine models of characters from the Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann were put in place knocked over taken Pieces remodeled, repainted and had their heads pulled off and substituted with special bonus tokens. Only a fresh pan of sausages from the galley would interrupt the crow's nest men's concentration when they would sulkily take a break to feed having taken snapshots of the board from several different angles to prevent treating. And so the winter wore on until one day the ice melted away and the pocket battleship sailed home. Trump's shore had abandoned ship by this time stomping off across the ice flows in curiously subdued fashion, no longer shouting at the sky, his face, barely visible behind the thick row of icicles dangling from the brim of his cap, stooping occasionally to pluck some kind of primitive edible life form from the cold, cold sea, with his forbid mitten fist. Blodgett what from the prow of the battleship, as his navigator vanished into the white nothingness. weeks later, they began the return voyage guided by the stars, which one of the crow's nest men knew how to read. Blog it was of course hauled before an Admiralty star chamber to account for himself. Why had he failed to sail to the faraway bay for a spot of gung ho gunboat diplomacy, he burbled and babbled and printed epaulettes and other trimmings. But at no point did he ever mentioned troubleshoot or even expunge the navigators name from the list of crew pinned up on a post at the entrance to the star chamber? And inevitably, there was no reference to troubleshoot in Blodgett, hopelessly inadequate Captain's log, which, I suppose begs the question. Did Trump short ever actually exist? Or was he erased or Phantom, or even a ghoul of the kind known to haunt ships of the line is like ply the oceans, sailing round and round and round into the Maelstrom.

Thompson's pamphlet meetings with remarkable owls out of print is a curious work. Ostensibly, it's a simple account of a week a walk, he took through the owl sanctuary, a screen hunahpu under the hours he came across, they're given the unfathomable depth of his own or theological ignorance. One is tempted to suggest that the pamphleteer only knew that the birds were he met were owls because of the big neon signage at the gate of the sanctuary. more remarkable than the owls themselves Surely, is the fact that Dobson was able to get anywhere near them in the first place. Ever since the so called inexplicably spooky event that centered on screen hunahpu farmyard, the entire area had been cordoned off by a massive security fence, patrolled by wolves and wild hogs. There had always been talk of the eerie barn and the mutant cow be though the hens and the disturbing well, to say nothing of the farm yard itself. But after what happened on that wild and windy October weekend, so great with the terror in the surrounding villages that the fence was erected overnight, and the wolves and wild hogs that loose around the perimeter. Dobson says nothing of this. We are asked to believe that he was out and about pounding the countryside one day when he found himself at the gate of the owl sanctuary and decided to investigate. This cannot be right. To get to the gate. He would first have had to find a way through the security fence without being savaged by wolves or wild hogs. Then they've had to cross the perilous bogs. Avoid the piano wire strung across the pathways clamber up the impossibly steep sludge banks find his way through the mist in crowded field riddled with concealed pits in which Kevlar spiders lay in white and pass through the nose. Korea's spinning of poisonous trees. Even having accomplished all that, he would somehow have had to persuade the century that the owl sanctuary gate that he was a bonafide visitor or they would have shot him on the spot and buried his corpse where it would never ever be found. The centuries were handpicked, undergoing rigorous psychological testing to flesh out any who had a less than fanatical protective instinct towards owls. Dobson was not a particularly boastful man, but he did have an operatic divas sense of drama, and it seemed scarcely credible, that he would let pass the opportunity to prattle on about so death defying a journey. So so we must be grateful for the research done by indefatigable dobs dentist Ted ccaq, whose recently published paper suggests that some weird properties in the atmosphere around screwin hunahpu farmyard may have actually modified Dobson's brain. One such modification, being a complete wiping clean of his memory between eating a truck is at the ramshackle kiosk adjacent to sawdust, bridge and arrival at the gate of the owl sanctuary Three days later. Some traditionalists have had harsh words to say about Ted CAC. After all, he made his name as a young firebrand with a deliberately provocative book, arguing that Dobson was not the true author of the bilgewater elegies and that the pamphleteer had never set foot in Winnipeg, let alone work there as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. There were these were and are preposterous theories and kept did himself no favors with his shoddy scholarship, Cavalier approach to source material and pomposity yet with his Anthony Burgess hairstyle, homerun glasses and barking voice, it was unnatural for television cat shows. And even the crust is Dobbs. inist still speaking or of his legendary appearance on rustle party plus. TV critic loopy seabag wrote at the time that quote, Ted Kak with his Anthony Burgess hairstyle, horn rimmed glasses, and barking voice is the best thing I've ever seen on television. Apart from it's a knockout. Quote.

It is an attempt to unravel what happened to Dobson on the day of his visit to the owl sanctuary. Ted cat put himself in the pamphleteers sturdy Hungarian flying officers boots, and recreated the journey. Of course, screwin hunahpu is much changed. The whole area around the farm yard has been flattened, and there is no longer any sign of the eerie barn, or the disturbing well, or the owl be though hens or indeed of the owl sanctuary. in their place, stands a derelict and abandoned shopping precinct in which feral beasts and teenagers cavort and Carew's. Only a branch of the plumbing train spigots are us remains open, and its stock is covered in dust and breadcrumbs. characteristically, Ted Kak was undeterred. he'd read a lot of books about psycho geography, and though he did not really understand what he read, he was determined to pretend to be a pamphleteer in that place at that time on that day, so many years ago, so much so that we prepared by eating a breakfast of bloaters and wearing a grumpy pair of trousers. And just as the painter Oskar kokoschka had a life sized rag doll made to replace his last love alma marva Ted Kak created a simulacrum of marigold to using string and warlin scrunched up dish cloth and waved it goodbye as he crashed out of the door on his way to sawdust bridge. The crucial paragraph in his research paper is this. There I stood, he wrote in a puzzle outside a boarded up milk bar, where one stood the gate of the screen hunahpu owl sanctuary. I had absolutely no idea how I got here. It was a diff my brain had been modified in some sinister way and my memory wiped clean. This leads me to the irrefutable conclusion that exactly the same thing happened to Dobson and that is why he never wrote about his perilous journey in his pamphlet meetings with remarkable owls out of print. What I do Not yet know is how permanent this brain modification will prove to be. God helped me. Well, I can't see any holes in this argument whatsoever. So I'm prepared to state that Ted Kak pompous and irritating as he may be, has solved one of the enduring mysteries of the pamphleteers career. As for the pamphlet itself, as I said, it's a curious work. trudging through the owl sanctuary. Dobson from time to time comes across an owl perched upon the branch of a tree. He attempts first to describe it, and this is where his lack of ornithological knowledge let him down. Each description consists almost entirely of the words head, beak, wings, big round eyes, talons and hooting sound in various combinations. But, but it's the second part of each meeting, to which we turn we're in Dobson tries to as he put that commune with the owls. He hates them, He flaps his arms as if they're wings. He pounces upon a squirrel or a field mouse and savages it and swallows it. He hoots again. I am Dobson he writes, and for today at least, I am become an owl. It is I think, not the owls which are remarkable in this instance, but Dobson himself.

It has been said that dopes in the AFA print pamphleteer bestrode the 20th century like a Colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself when still a young man at the age of 20. He published a pamphlet resoundingly entitled. Why I shall bestride this century like a Colossus it's a curious work out of print of course, a thin cracked with a picture of a whooper Swan on the cover begins that I shall bestride this century like a Colossus My name will ring out like a clarion in years to come. Whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers there will be but one name on their lips Dobson such self belief in so Calloway youth is touching. Looking back in his doted. Dobson found it touching too, and he took two sittings, sitting with his one remaining copy of the pamphlet, clutched his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end. When marigold crew found in that she flung open the windows whatever the weather and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea shanties. Invariably, Dobson's self pitying lassitude would be broken, and he would have a curiously pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe away his tears, Don his Bolivian military boots and his Stalinist cardigan and crashed out of the house to go on one of his joints. Dobson's Jones in the latter part of his life, usually took him to the nearest pigsty. But there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far that day, that he came upon shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other device by Yoko Ono, as part of an art project to promote world peace, postal delivery persons in that city were required by law to learn all the double street names by heart or to face summary dismissal if they failed, often, those who did fail, and there were many would flounder around on the outskirts of the city, warning travelers away. It was a paltry sort of revenge, and seldom succeeded for the delights of that shining city on a hill attracted wayfarers from near and far daily in their thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before that particular Thursday, or even Tuesday, a dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he was about to cross a pontoon bridge that would take him into the most boisterous quarter of the city. go no further old man said this vengeful figure. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tonal cadence. This city your approach is no place for out of print pamphlet is ever sensitive to warnings from spooks and drapes. Dobson turned around and went home. He found marigold crew in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous sheet of corrugated cardboard. I was warned away from a shining city on a hill he said Is it a city you have visited? marigold to stop drilling, reset the safety catch and remove protective goggles. You are a foolish old man in your dotage Dobson she said, though there was kindness in her voice. And it is well you were born the way for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill sits atop a hollow and harbors within it heaven and some say hell either way. I'm pleased to see you home. Let us clear the nettles from the vegetable garden. That was what was what that was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century. Did Dobson indeed describe it as a Colossus he was not the only person to think so. But the names of the others escaped me for the time being when I remember them. I'll tell you.

piece I just read has been chosen as a set text for the entrance examinations to bodgers spinny infant school. Here are some sample questions likely to be faced by the tiny candidates. One Imagine you are the dismissed postal delivery person who encounters Dobson Baba pontoon bridge would you have handled the situation in the same way? Think about what you would have said to the out of print pamphleteer then translated into Latin to do you think Yoko Ono's unnecessary double naming of the streets in the shining city on the hill would make a significant contribution to world peace. give reasons for your answer in terse, cogent prose, then translate that into Latin to three, give a brief account of the career of David Blunkett with special reference to his second resignation, speech and tearful use of the phrase, the little lad or was that the first resignation speech? For if you could bestride a century like a Colossus, which century would you choose? So to this stride and why extra marks will be awarded if you turn pale, nor the end of your pencil in desperation, and crumpled to the floor, twitching and shattered. And that's the end of this week's show which is featured have a theme banana is not only of Dobson but of the bilgewater allergies, which is mentioned somewhere, I think in each of those pieces, or bilgewater is and I might read bilgewater elegies to you next week. You will have to wait to find out goodbye
