This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. If you're listening on a digital device, my name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air coming to you for the fourth and final week from the Science Museum. As you walk into the Science Museum, or in my case as you trudge exhausted and panting into the Science Museum, there's a big sign saying, the first thing you see is a sign saying welcome to the home of human ingenuity. And it's true it's a temple of science. It's a it's a temple of human ingenuity. So I thought, what better place to talk about God or rather, Gods plural. gab, gamma, happy and nubus. Consume raw. These are God's viano toys or trinkets, plastic figurines or dolls made out of scraps of wall or straw. They are God's Ma, rk checkmate hassle, Horace. These two are God's mighty imperious gods. gab is the great caterpillar. Happy the father of the gods. And new birth, the jackal. kaname, the Lord of the cool waters, raw, the sun god, ma Mart, the goddess of truth.

So back he who causes the fertility taught to great lady sesh at our session, the lady of the library and Seth, the Lord of Upper Egypt, these of the gods you are not in Upper Egypt, nor a Lower Egypt. You are not in Egypt at all. But wherever your ditch is, in this night of as hard as iron, you are base yourself before these gods because you must the time for toys and trinkets for the bobble and the Google is long past and you have left all fripperies behind you now there is simply you and your Gods locked together in the face of the stark blank sky.

Now, plonk your brow in the muck on the floor of the diction cast your mind back to that Golden happy childhood when you clashed in the paddling pool on a sun blazed summer's day. The water was cool and delightful. The water in your paddling pool.

Did you rush home wrapped in your big yellow towel and worship? Could Noma. Did you think Khanum? Did you thank them for the coolness of the water? Dried and cooled? Did you clock your library ticket in your tiny hand and scamper excitedly to the public lending library to borrow a book of fairy stories? You would have looked for something with pictures of elves and wizards and parries and hobgoblins and found a compendium perhaps carried it on tippy toe to the issuing desk. By in the glorious sunshine streaming through those enormous library windows. Have the book stamped and born you're born it away out onto the path in the bright afternoon. When you got home, safe in your bedrooms strewn with pillows and cushions and patchwork quilts and throws, did you cry out in gratitude to sesh at vote note, Horace, Seth are nubus these are God's all powerful and eternal. I can picture you a few summers later, older but no wiser traipsing around in the park at lunchtime. You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon the grasses food for sparrows and magpies and starlings for Linux and ravens for bufflehead ducks and greens. Sitting on the rusty bench with this rusty plaque in memory of one long dead who sat here often and adored the view the view of rooftops and chimneys and football fields and allotments of tennis courts and orchards rich in cherry trees. I see you casting your crumbs to the birds and I know that you are not giving thanks to Accutane or gab or sec metal patar. No steel at this time. Despite your riches and your bravura. Your poor head is filled with visions of its apicultural coac Likud tenemos cackle keki cloudlock Maya while kichwa Otto hora in Kata popocatepetl and the like. For these are your gods in the grip of your delusions, it is perhaps not coincidental that you'd like to sport a yellow Polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man and even have your hair cut in a similar mop. Though you are not yet going gray and you insist that you have not seen the film for you professor devotion to the silent screen. In your Pantheon, Abel ganz rub shoulders with ox amaco really engaged with cracks out of collateral. You have seen broken blossoms more than a dozen times. And sometimes you'd like to pace the backstreets of Limehouse, as if in search of the opium dens that are no longer there. The dens from which Sherlock Holmes emerged, twitching and shattered in the man with the twisted lip. Those fogging, shrouded days are as distant now as the bright summers of your paddling pool youth. Yet you cling to your false gods. As you feed the birds and ducks in the park shaded from nooks glittering sky by the overhanging branches of Sycamores and Hazel freeze on the bench by the magnificent iron railings, which were replaced after the war in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach burned by flaming barrels and crushed by falling masonry. But now there is not a scratch on you. And you have forgotten that terrible day and shaving and you were treated well in the field hospital. But what did you do once you could again use your hands you scavenged scraps of food and built a little toy altar and put it on your bedside shelf. praying that it still Lord your God of healing for having saved you from the realm of MC land technique.

So let us bring forward again now another 1020 years and now your hair is gray but no longer cut Allah Lord summer I'll in The Wicker Man. Your yellow Polo neck is threadbare now and you use it as a duck cloth. There is much dust in your house for the air is never still there. drafts curling under the door and around the window frames for much of the wood is rotting away under sustained attack by weevils and woodworms. microscopic forms of life you have ignored for too long. baleful, greasy, plump, a little cracked, you shuffle from room to room pointlessly, as if you have been kenneled all your money's gone, exhausted by your postwar do butcheries you have a blighted reputation and constant pins and needles. This is what accounts for your restlessness, this shuffling from bedroom to pantry to parlors or outhouse, from attic to cellar and back again, up and down and round and round. And always with your liver spotted fist clamped around a little tin medallion of Montezuma, as if that might fend off the night, the darkness, the vastness of eternity. You have a kitten, but it hates you. You have not yet been subjugated by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you call your kitten Karen Carpenter, and feed it with fish that you caught from ponds or with eels. You see from the back kitchens have canteens and your kitten hisses at you and claws you and hates the sight of you. You are fearful of the light in these in those green eyes for you, right the sense that they see into your soul, your small and puny soul, all curdled by a life of wasted delusion that sent 10 Ted Koppel would bring you corn that chanted co would warm your heart. But the wind cried a heck. The gods are in readiness for you. And the wind is cold. Yes, if he's not now and you are in your ditch, the wind is cold and the sky is black. And there are no birds, not even crows. Your kitten tore that pitiful tin medallion from your hand and dropped it down a well. You are alone but for God's gab happy and Lubis consume raw. You have sunk to your knees that blurred black and white image of Lillian Gish stricken by panic and the wind is fading fast. like Sherlock Holmes, you too are twitching and shattered. But no opiates brought you to this Mart attend sec met hassle. Horror Horace. There is no longer any traffic, no car horns, no rattling cart, no clanking steam applying across the Strait. Despite your wealth, you never did fly in an aeroplane across oceans and continents. You never did go and live in that house on stilts that you pictured in your mind's eye when you were young. Parks and ponds were your domain parks and ponds. And now this ditch a trickle of foul brackish water running through it. You've kept some in your hands and splash it on your burning brow. But it's not the cold water from the paddling pool given to you by cannula all those years ago. Emerald ISIS Bastet note patar Aqua, Capri sobic taught sesh at Seth that came that day last Thursday, when your nerves were so brittle and the pins and needles became too much and you flung your Montezuma medallion across the panfry and cursed your gods. And the kitten crept up to you and fixed its green eyes on you. You retrieved your Hugo and fled to the park to watch the grebes but you were shaken. You have not been stable since then.

There was mentioned in that in that tale of gods of Karen Carpenter, and by strange coincidence, where a cat called a kitten called Karen Carpenter. By strange coincidence, Karen Carpenter turns up in the next piece, which is called what you should know about the carpenters. Karen played the drums and sang her brother Richard played keyboards and supplied backing vocals. Unfortunately, Karen died young Richard is still alive, still active in music, but the carpenters as a duo are no longer with us. These bare facts stated, astute listeners will note the remarkable similarities between the carpenters and the Homer nimic. The carpenters who were so successful during the 1970s with songs such as close to you and calling occupants of in interplanetary craft. Neither of these songs was recorded by the carpenters of whom we speak, for their music was somewhat different. And a blend of South bluegrass acid jazz bell ringing and caterwauling, often driven by motorized electric balalaika is programmed by Karen. Rick was known to be fond of factory Hooters. debut album, the carpenters play the music of dreams lost from an abandoned salt mine included the astonishing 16 minute dying be music number eight, which featured guests including Blodgett, Blodgett dentist, Blodgett, dentist, dentist, and a young impressionable Scottish lad called meet your sales were few and a booking on a transatlantic cruise liner proved ill advised. Neither Kara nor Richard could swim, and when the ship sank of the Auckland islands, they spent six week marooned in a dingey fighting some side Karen's health problems stemmed from this ordeal, and they may well be right. But in the words of the old farmyard, saying, never put two carpenters in the same dingey. There Annus Mirabilis was probably 1975. In a nine month period, they released no less than 26 he pays, each of which was conceived as a punitive retrench retrenchment, to use Richards phrase. Karen scoffed at this description, incidentally, preferring to think of these matchless works as lullabies for locust swarms. The most startling thing about this record is the pared down instrumentation. Karen thumping the soul of her boot on a giant drum, Richard, tentatively prodding the black keys on a plastic toy piano. Both sang Of course, or rather harmed gargled and choked. After Karen toppled from a radio mast in 1981, Richard approved the release of just one further recording a set of minuette bagatelles and umpires arranged for brass band and an electronically enhanced flock of challenges. Karen's drumming had been recorded pneumatically in the clinic, where she spent her final years sitting slumped on a catbird seat, wrapped in a gaudy and enormous Poncho, which engulfed her tiny wasted body. We attempted to interview Richard for this short pace, but his people sent an email saying that he was far too peevish

This being the Science Museum this week, as in the previous three weeks I'm going to read selections from further science book 20 by Norman Davis, published in 2001.

almost the end of this week show and devar hooting yard residents in the Science Museum, but I think we should end it being the Science Museum with a tiny bit more further science from Norman Davis. This is from his section Europe read soups, one that's in Europe etc. Read soups go from the cold beetroot red in Russia northwest to two egg thick cold beetroot soup in Poland. Three to pepper hot thick bacon and red tomato and red cabbage in Germany for two green pea and ham soup in Holland. Five to pepper hot tomato fish etc soup in France sick and pepper hot green cabbage in Hungary eight red and white hard cold kidney beans in Italy. Nine bland, hard cold red lentil soup in Morocco. And I hope you've enjoyed the show. And I hope you've enjoyed the Science Museum shows. And that's all from hooting yard. And may Frankie for this week. Bye bye
