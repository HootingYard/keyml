Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM, the radio station other radio stations don't actually on one of those other radio stations, I won't say which one. But on one of those radio stations, they have a program called farming today. And this week, it's goat week. So, goat week, day four. So I'm not sure what you're meant to actually do. But pamper your goat if you have one. And if you haven't got a goat, go and find a goat to pamper. My name is Frankie, this is hooting yard on the air. And the evidence shows that this is how the murder was committed. The victim was a fanatic named vanity vanity, all this vanity, known as volve for short. He made his living as a Thumper. He thumped both tubs and Bibles. And sometimes, when he was strung out on dandelion and burdock, he thumped police officers, puppies and other things beginning with PII, such as pin cushions. On the day of the murder, Valve woke at dawn and rose from his bed and shoved his head into a pile of icy water and thump tub and ate some cream crackers and stood on his balcony and engaged in blood curdling invective with his downstairs neighbor and thumped a Bible and tallied up the visible toads and combed his hair with a bedraggled and fossick in a cupboard and took a swipe at a bat and pray the Lord his soul to save and wrapped a cravat around his neck, his neck, his neck, and pay no heed to the weather forecast, and left his gloves on the bus. And eked from its shell a tiny, wriggling and identified creature, and admired the view from the sawdust bridge and boxed clever and dipped and often in a pond and failed to understand foreign signage and almost toppled into a ditch but righted himself at the critical moment, and had a go at a game of regurgitates the cream crackers, and scratched an irritant and looked at the town hall clock, and thumped a few things beginning with P. and pursed his lips, his lips, his lips, and tossed the hard boiled egg. So hi, it vanished in the ether. And he lost all sense of cardboard, and did a few other things on his way to the post office. at the post office, evolve, join the queue. The back of the head of the person in front of him was a phonologists nightmare. This reminded volved that he had in his blazer pocket, a copy of Dobson's pamphlet, a compendium of phrenologist nightmares out of print, it occurred to him that this would be a suitable gift for his brother, whose birthday it was today. Unfortunately, volve knew not where his brother was, the last he had heard of him. He was being carted off in chains to a prison Hulk after committing a series of enormities volve had no idea of the location of the Hulk, nor if his brother was still there in chains raving, while the sea sloshed against the sides, and birds swooped overhead in glorious aerial displays of avian grace and beauty. What we know now is that Bob's brother had escaped and was at that very moment, bearing down on the post office, rattling his chains and raving and strung out on dandelion and burdock, diluted with seawater, and mad as a kitten on the moon, and armed with a club manufactured for the slaughter of baby seals, and dribbling and drooling and forgotten by gold and tormented by imaginary bells. A company and kitten because they were chained together, was the second escaped convict. A man named Mr. shma had been sent to the prison Hulk drew to the shape of his head. Of course, To the judiciary's phrenologist the bumps and dents in schmalz scowl were indicative of the kind of criminal who would steal toffee apples from crippled children, or forged his bus ticket or hang out his laundry with the wrong sorts of clothes pegs. No malfeasance great or small was beyond him, or would be beyond him in theory.

Meanwhile, in the post office volve with perplexed every time the queue shuffled forward, the counter seemed to receive further into the distance. volve wondered if he could correct this anomaly by shuffling backwards instead of forwards. In so doing, he stepped on the tail of the person behind him. There was an altercation, Valve noticed that his antagonist was wearing a suit tie in and carrying a prayer book and a set of rosary beads. Thus, he was a priest. Thus he was something beginning with P. Thus, he thumped him, the priest was an advocate of muscular Christianity and thump to volve. In turn, the thumping might have continued interminably were it not for the sudden arrival in the post office doorway of vobs Brava and Ma. And so we come to the murder. What has not been mentioned thus far is that evolved from certain angles in a certain light during certain phases of the moon, in certain post office cues, born astonishing resemblance to a baby seal. brute instinct therefore led his brother to charge screaming at him and battling relentlessly and mercilessly with his baby seal curling club. He bashed and bashed until volve lay dead on the post office floor. Then, pausing only to snap from his brother's blazer pocket the copy of Dobson's pamphlet, a compendium of phrenologist nightmares out of print, he escaped the escaped convict slipped his shackles, thrust the bloodied club into schmalz weedy hands and scarpered, making a beeline first for the bus stop, and then boarding a number 666 riding all the way to the end of the route, an eerily deserted Terminus or the edge of the cold, wet and pitying marshes where he hid among reads, and catkins Calkins, feeding on insects and Marsh water, and occasionally waylaying tiny Marsh land children, terrifying the poor little mites, still forgotten by God, but forgotten by the coppers too and left free to live out his days splashing around in the marsh and reading the Dobson pamphlet, running his fingers delicately over his own scowl, feeling the bumps and dents and slowly, very slowly turning into a marsh warbler, and flying soaring through the blue sky, migrating to other marshes in other lands far, far away. When detective Captain Kirk pan arrived at the post office, it was all too obvious what had happened. There was volve, bludgeoned and dead on the floor. There was shma, holding the club, looking as if he was about to be sick and in possession of a head, the shape of which any phrenologist worth their salt would attest, screamed criminal shma fighting down with difficulty, the last of his nausea, pressed his mouth against the shoulder of the policeman, who stepping lightly laid him away. And the first sentence and the last in that piece were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin knew everything in between with not

bear with me. I'll be waiting Every second now, all I would be if I weren't having technical problems, which seemed to be occurring, rather more often than I would like these days, I've just managed to lose everything I wanted to read. How Hold on a second, and we'll try and get there. Yes, it's goat week. So I like to think I've got anything to read to you about goats, which is an oversight on my part. But I will have something to read to you. When I have overcome my technical problem. Which is imminent, I think, well, imminent ish. And it's really is not good. Is it? I need to get a grip on them. On the right, here we are.

Frank Key  11:04
The Right, yeah, I'm okay. The rebranding exercise applied to the Seven Dwarves of Snow White acquaintance has, by any measure been a PR triumph. Everyone is familiar with their names. Well done. It was so with hamstrung, pointy and downcast. Wouldn't would that it was so with hamstrung pointy and downcast, a trio now largely forgotten. So much so that even the cleverest brainboxes would be hard pressed to say whether they were a musical act or a set of cartoon script characters or if they occupied some other corner of popular culture. there is uncertainty to regarding the identity of the third member who is sometimes referred to as downcast and other times there's mordant references to the most scattered here and there in the records of the past in biographies and memoirs, old newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, letters, official and unofficial reports, and salvaged ephemeral bitty Bob's, yet hamstrung, pointy and downcast somehow refuse to swim into focus. They remain impossible to pin down, each seeming fact contradicted or even erased by the next. Consider, as one example the nature of their living quarters, based in a story, based on a glancing and non to clear bit of foot notary in a photocopy of a manuscript by Padstow. Many people are of the view that hamstrung pointy and downcast inhabited a sweat launch. At least point he is said to have used the word lodge when filling in forms, and the three of them emitted copious amounts of sweat, to the extent that they collected it in sealed jars, which they tried to mark it as some sort of medicinal potion. Though the details of that little enterprise are so disgusting, that we would best not dwell on them. Yet elsewhere gobbing in the violence of seats, the vileness of seaside resorts, is it suggested that hamstrung and pointy if not downcast whose name is given here as Morden moved permanently in the sand and silt and build beneath a jetty and were semi amphibious to boot. The evidence for this appears to be a scribble in the margin of a police report, prepared by legendary copper detective Captain kargh pan, but whether the scribble in his in his hand or that of one of his brutish subordinates, is not made clear. Like so much else in the matter of hamstrung, pointy and downcast we are left clutching haplessly at straws, straws that snap or a born away on a gust of fierce and sudden wind. And wild is the wind, I hear the sound of mandolins of necessity, we have to read between the lines, and sometimes not just between them, but behind them, or at an angle to them. HP Lovecraft might have described as belonging to an abnormal geometry, load simile regiment of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. What we do when we do that, we may come no closer to gaining a proper conceptual grasp of the trio. But we can appreciate I think that there was a time when hamstrung, pointy and downcast were as famous as Joseph Stalin or Martin tapper, Xavi a coup Gad, and as culturally significant. Perhaps we ought to recall that passage in the memoirs of old hollub, the coach and mentor fictional athletes, Bob net tavole, where he writes, I went out to the kiosk to buy a carton of high tar cigarettes. And as I clattered along the street, it seemed to me the ground, the sky, the air, by Christ, every stone in every atom in creation, with somehow shouting out the names of that illustrious threesome, safe and snug in their sweat, Lord, you're under the jetty in sand and silt and build. It is telling that the sentence was expunged from the published version of the memoirs, for reasons never divulged to the hoi polloi.

This is a place called a visit to a mine. Today the chief engineers have been down to our part of the mine. They descended in the rickety left of the Sylvia Townsend Warner Memorial shaft and stood in a huddle puffing on their pipes and blowing smoke, the Canaries. whether this was vindictive, or in the interest of scientific research was not clear. There were seven of them, like Snow White, seven run mining dwarves, and they were similarly more anonymous. The chief engineers were known as wretched spiteful incontinent, peevish, mipi, rancorous and preening. One might assume these names to reflect their personalities, but that was not the case. If we consult their academic report from the Valentine excellent Memorial College of mining, boring and pit craft, we learned that record was judged to be preening and rancorous, spiteful to be lucky and peevish, incontinent to be spiteful and wretched. peevish to be rancorous and incontinent. Lippi to be preening and spiteful rancorous to be peevish, and lippy and preening to be illegible. Not one of them was a dwarf, or even a gnome. They stood puffing in silence for a while, until one of them spoke. It strikes me that this mine is rather Kapha esque said Ruby. Oh, in what sense, the other six said or rather sang in harmony to the tune of land of ladies by the brothers Johnson. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the management of the mind is Kapha esque set up in that it is labyrinthine, senseless and in that it is a labyrinth time, senseless and oppressive bureaucracy. Consider that there are several of us chief engineers, yet only three miners. He was referring to me and my two colleagues, who were taking a break from toil in order to meet with the chief engineers lippie called us miners, but we prefer to think of ourselves as troglodytes. None of us had been up to the surface since the dying days of the Nixon administration. We had been transfixed by the Watergate hearings. Shortly before going down the mine we compiled a who's who of the scandal, in which the three of us drew sharp, pointed pen portraits of the significant players, including Nixon himself, and Ronald Ziegler, and Ken Clawson, and HR Haldeman and Donald segreti, and Dwight to leave typing, and john Dean, and john and Martha Mitchell and Bruce Curley, and Gordon C. Stratton, and Herbert Warren, come back and Chuck Colson and Gerry and the pacemakers, and Robert C. mardian. And Jeb McGruder, and Morris stands and Drea gordon liddy not lippy and Hugh Sloane and Dr. McCord and john Ehrlichman and David Young and Angel Crowe and E. Howard hunt. Richard kleindienst and Richard Helms and Patrick gray and Vernon Walters we thought it judicious to admit our own names and to be on the safe side volunteered for duty in the salt mine until the whole sorry business and blown over. Now faced with seven Crieff engineers, we would have to dissemble well, oh, weird. hunched. Our below man of the pit said lippy. They'd be addressing us directly for the first time. We have come down into the studio and gloom to find out how much salt you've mined. I must say the production figures are disappointing. I can assure you we have been tireless in our search for salt down here. I lied. And in fact, we think we spotted a tab just before you and your fellow chief engineer's arrived. Excellent cellularity, then perhaps we could leave you free to mine it. There is nothing we would enjoy more. I lied again. But before we do so, would it not be wise for the seven of you to check that what we found actually is salt and not some other mineral with properties closely resembling but not identical to salt. lippy went back into a huddle with Richard and spiteful and incontinent and peevish and rancorous and preening. To discuss this.

I was revising because we've not actually been looking for salt at all, nor had we found any not even a tad. Instead, we've been opening up Kevin, and creating a huge underground cavity in which we were breeding an entirely new type of hyper intelligent subterranean Canary. This represented a great advance on what we've been up to in the Watergate building on that night in June 1972. But we could not yet reveal our doings to lippie and his fellows. I finished talking and lippie turned to me very well. He said. Where are we to find this Tad of what may be salt. I pointed at the entrance to an excessively long, dark, winding, horrible tunnel. Go down there, I said, mine, excuse me. And mind your step. It is wrong and dark and winding and horrible. And so 10 minutes ago, the naive if not outright, idiotic, Chief engineers went pootling off down a tunnel so long and dark and winding and horrible, that is likely to drive them insane. They will find those salt and they may be attacked by a few stray hyper intelligent subterranean canaries. But we don't care. Besides, our shift will soon come to an end. We will not be here to see them coming back. And the first and last sentences of that piece were translated from the German by will and Edwin Moore and everything in between was not

several listeners have written into asking me if any parallels can be drawn between grandma pips drawers lovely zoo, and Noah's Ark. I was quite surprised that I received letters about this because I haven't actually mentioned grandma PIP straws lovely Zoo on the show yet, but I will be doing soon. So I don't know whether these listeners have been in some kind of time travel situation. Perhaps they have. Anyway, are there any parallels that can be drawn between grandma PIP straws, lovely zoo, another's Ark? The answer is very few, the most noteworthy of which is that grandma PIP straw had three sons named ham Shem and Japheth. Fans of 1960s Folk pop my record the most the singing PIP strolls. Think of the seekers minus Judith daarom. Indeed, the singing PIP strolls was sometimes mistaken for the Australian foursome minus Judas daarom chiefly because Shen pips through bore a striking resemblance to seek Athol guy. He even obtained his trademark spectacles from the same optician Despite living on the other side of the world from that most wistful of AI specialists interesting read the opticians given name was Noah and he lived on a boat. Morden, an important Australian river, the name of which escapes me. I wanted to say the Maitland but I think that in Canada, there are so many rivers, not only in Australasia and North America, but also on the other continent I can I can hardly be expected to remember them all. And to know at the drop of a hat, which ones are on which continents. I've never proclaimed myself a river expert, unlike ham PIP straw, who when he was not strumming a stringed instrument and warbling like nothing better than to pour over atlases and gazetteers, memorizing all the rivers of the world, their names and length and locations and directions of flow. By the time of his tragically early death, ham pipistrel had committed to memory the details of at least six rivers worldwide. Several listeners have written in in the last few seconds to ask for details of the tragically early death of 60s Folk pop legend ham pips draw. It happened like this. He was visiting the zoo and aviary run by his mother, known as grandma pips drawers and lovely zoo. When he was engulfed in a flock of winged cats. The frantic beefing of their Tiny Wings did for ham pips draw.

He was memorialized in a song by his surviving brothers, which topped the hit parade until it was dislodged by a disc more in keeping with the funky soccer groove which fuddled the heads of the so called New Generation, all generations are new. That's the point of them. shaman Dreyfus invited Noah to replace him, so they could be a trailer game. But the wistful Australian optician declined, citing a devotion to the correction of eyesight, a 10 year and the trauma he had experienced when his own beat combo recorded their difficult second album after getting away to the country. Other parallels between grandma pips drawers lovely Zoo and Noah's Ark are the subject of a forthcoming stage musical starring a hologram of the late Dusty Springfield. And I'm afraid that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week, I think. I hope you've enjoyed it. Remember, it's a joke week. And I don't really have anything else to say. go and visit the heating yard website at hooting our.org read millions of literally millions of words. I think now it's been going since it's been going for 15 years, the hooting God website and while you're there, you can buy some books. You could send a donation you could he could refresh the page that's a good one. You might even say something new when you do I'll be back next week I think I hope and I think we're gonna record retitle the show a general error decrepitude Bye bye.
