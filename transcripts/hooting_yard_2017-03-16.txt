Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air or as it's now known hooting yard in the electromagnetic field. Or if you prefer hooting yard all around my hat. I mean, whatever you prefer to call it. That's what it's going to be called from now on. I think I should just call more show hooting yard and I want my life easier. Tomorrow, apparently is St. Patrick's Day. So I thought I would read to you an extract from Pierce penulis his supplication to the devil, by the great Thomas Nash, one of my favorite writers. This is from piers panelists, and it's called the nature of the Irishman. And that's why I thought I'd read it for St. Patrick's day tomorrow. So, Thomas Nash, the nature of the IRA. The causes conducing under Roth, are as diverse as the actions of a man's life. Some will take on like a madman if they say, if I start again. The causes conducing under wrath are as diverse as the actions of a man's life. Some will take on like a madman if they see a pig come to the table. So Tarik, as the surgeon was choleric, at the site of sturgeon, the Irishman will draw his dagger and be ready to kill and slay if one break wind in his company, and to some of our Englishman that our soldiers if one gives them the lie, that these are light matters where have peers complain, if not, the advertised master stinking mouth, be evil of the blacksmith. Lawyers cannot devise which way in the world to beg by are so troubled with Brad moments and whipped every turn of Yeoman and gentlemen that fall out for nothing. If john and Nokes his hand do not meet into Elizabeth the gap close, she will never leave to haunt her husband till he bring it to a nisi Prius. One while the parson su with the parishioner for bringing home his tides. Another while the parishioner service the passion for not taking away his tides in time.

I don't know if you go like a madman if someone brings a pig to the table, but maybe some people do. And moving on, this is an outdoor game that will bring gleeful smiles to Chinese and adults alike. Buy a bag of plums from the greengrocers and whistle as you and your families strive purposefully to a place of panels. It might be a canal towpath, or a field or even a derelict shopping precinct. And then these only be a single puzzle. Take the plumbers out of the bag and distribute them to the family members so that everyone has the same number. If the numbers of persons and plumbers do not match up, you can either put the plumbers back into the bag and go back to the greengrocers to buy some more or have one or more family members carted away by the secret police. Once you have that settled, the game can begin. Each takes their turn to throw their plum or plums into the puddle. If someone's plum misses the puzzle And lands on the towpath or the grass or the concrete. They can either take their turn again, or pay a forfeit, such as being carted away by the secret police. When all the plans are bobbing about in the puzzle, the game is over and you can go home taking a short detour past the secret police interrogation center to attempt to retrieve any family members who have been carted there. This will usually be pointless. However, as the secret policeman at the gate will deny any knowledge of your family members and insist that the interrogation center is button innocent warehouse or office building. Do not become jumpy, or ill tempered with the secret policeman or you will likely to become an unperson after a period of interrogation, and you won't be throwing any plums into a puzzle ever again.

Tip Top cop group the tip the top two folds have released a new single which is streaming towards the steaming towards the top of the charts. My monkey has an au is a sprightly yet full on ballad telling of the lead thing as pet monkey Allen being hospitalized and a monkey hospital after contracting an au. It is an odd sort of Monkey hospital. The lyrics make explicit that it's closely based on the hospital in a carry on film. So there are nine checks for Kenneth Williams as a doctor having drapes as matron and Charles Hawtrey as a way the patient languishing in the bed next to the monkeys. so vivid is the picture painted by the words though, that we accepted and trust to its various similitude even though if we give it a moment sober thought it is powerful. As we've all stepped up to full tracks, it's a toe tapper while at the same time being emotionally devastating. For those who have not yet heard it, I will not spoil the song by giving away its ending. All I will say is that in the final verse, the scene changes from the monkey hospital to a monkey graveyard. The beside of the single is more smoochy than toe Tapi aparent rari nan tears in gurgi t vasto features the sampled voices of both Hattie Drake's and Charles Hawtrey, they are not Kenneth Williams, and it scored unusually for the tip top to falls, or indeed for any other pop group for Wurlitzer organ, Piccolo and Brazil nuts. At 11 and a half minutes it's by far the longest track the group has ever released. And it's fair to say that it outstayed its welcome by a good 10 minutes also. This has not deterred top pop critic Ted pop cred from hailing it as quote, The smooth years beside ever committed to wax cylinder recording technology that I have heard since yesterday afternoon. maddeningly, but characteristically, Ted does not divulge what he was listening to yesterday afternoon. So I rang him up to ask. Hello, I said is that Ted pop cred? But in reply, all I heard was a lovecraftian bubbling sound of glob glob glob. I surmise that Ted must be listening to the tip top to falls previous chart topper, the sprightly yet for lawns Mooji toe tapper disgusting seaside resort. Pop fans will know that this smash hit features the sampled voices of Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, and that tremendous chorus, the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing, so startling because it has nothing whatsoever to do with seaside resorts. If you would like to join the tip top tuples fan club you will strongly advise to consult a qualified medical practitioner or a man of the cloth, whichever suits your pocket.

tree for mango loopy pigs have shown the dogs was one whose head had dimensioned similar to those of a large plump. And it's huge to its huge war tent if you will, a splenetic fellow of milk stained necktie and eggy brow, whatever that might be slumped in his hammock at all hours, safer when he was off on a jump armed with a blunderbuss and the head of a run neck chicken dangling from a lanyard, about which foolishly he had written the song or lanyard fare, to the tune of carry on wayward son by Kansas. Nothing to do apparently with the carry on film series starring such screen luminaries as happy drapes and Charles Hawtrey, the latter a resident of deal their sandwich in Kent, where the chief loopy Prager show Murdoch's had been known to picnic on occasion, and exhibit his gift for snatching wasps in mid bass, reaching to grab them in his fist with it strange musculature before plopping them into an empty marmalade jar, and screwing the lid down tight, the better to transport them to the wasp Zoo at tan Tara been banned. Fourth, a place with the only known conjunction of BIM and bam in its name, if the gadget is of that land would be believed, and why would they not be? I put this question in its entirety from that opening truth to the closing beat to both Condoleezza Rice and Ringo Starr. Neither has seen fit to reply, yet, which causes me some grief, though not enough grief to provoke weeping yet. The weeping will come I'm sure of it perhaps by next Thursday. If I've still not heard from rice or star, in which case, I will be minded to take the Alger Hiss option. It is unclear to me of what this option consists. But I will strive to find out by visiting my local library abutting the market square with its enormous cement horse trough now a bed of flowers, pinks, and posies and lupins and hollyhocks, and nary a horse in sight anymore since the triumph of the motorcar. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. For example, only the other day I met in a shabby cafeteria, a dreamer who wants played the drums for Freddy's pop group, and he told me that he had been dreaming about the tree for loopy. prigge Sharma dogs. Exactly. Except that for him, it was more nightmare than dream for the wasp that escaped from the marmalade jar. How and stung him on his eggy brow, that mysterious phrase again, last waking him from his troubled sleep, waking him into a world where there was no Sting, no wasp, nor even a loopy prick of shell Murdoch's vast, baffled the dreaming drama arose from his bed and threw away his crutches and walked to where did he walk to town Tara been banned for and what did he do there? He rattled a tin what was in the tin, two buttons, from whence had the buttons come? The buttons and one spin the eyes of a rag doll, a ventriloquist dummy, now blind, languishing in a crate in a storage facility in Dale, near sandwich in Kent. Imagine that.

Last week, as far as I can recall, I urge you to go to the hooting yard website at hunting yard.org For the purpose of looking at a photograph of the Danish please make aurasma thol strap. I hope you did. Of course while you were there hooting God You can also read all this stuff that I read for yourself or will stuff that I read out to you on the radio. You can also buy lots of books that are available books of hooting Yari. Or you can just send a donation which is always appreciated. So go to the hooting yard website. You will find I think millions of words now possibly have must be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands. Yes, go there, read stuff, buy books, send money, or just go and look at a photograph of rasma thol strop. Anyway, speaking of him, I stumbled upon born shortly after himmelfarb it was my good fortune to have an emotional cushion. I had prayed for a pillow, but I got a cushion, so I could not complain. There was old black and white footage of last a Viren on the box. I thought I spotted balk behind the box. This was not something I expected and it caused those tremors I thought had gone forever. Like the gurgling things. They were gurgling is now but they seem to come from bought. I was minded to take a closer look. But the little voice in my head urged caution. Last a Viren continued to pound along the track, like a non fiction botnet to evolve. I turned the sound down, the better to hear Bob. There were definite good links interrupted by a whistling kettle I decamped to the kitchen. Well, I will properly say kitchenette, if not kitchenette at it was tiny. The kettle was correspondingly tiny to the whistle. It was so loud that it drowned out the girdle rings. This was a small mercy and I was reluctant to remove the kettle from the hub had I tried to do so it would in any case have been held fast by the hobgoblins. I had been trying to eradicate these from my kitchenette at since before himmelfarb. There was a spray but it did little good. on the advice of Baines I fashioned a crucifix from stalks of rhubarb and suspended it from a rafter with a chain. Nobody told me painted with a credit I will about in the kitchenette at trying to work out what to do next. outside a crow landed on the lawn, then another and another. Soon there were so many crows I could no longer see the grass. I felt sure this had somehow been contrived by Bork. Even if I had absolutely no idea how or why. I tried to concentrate my mind on himmelfarb. I summon up what faint courage I had and return to the power to peek behind the box. Last a Viren had vanished from the box to be replaced by Emil's at OPEC who was running in a different direction. He looked like a man wrestling with an octopus on a conveyor belt. I know that is not an original observation, but it had never seemed more true. I dropped and almost forgot about bought. But then the sound of the gurgling snapped me back to the present. What youth were athletics to me now. Then another question forced itself into my brain. Why were the crows on the lawn silent? Should they not have been coiling? That is two questions. It is no surprise that i did i have i had dessert on himmelfarb had I not and look where my dithering got me beset by kitchenette at hobgoblins. And with only a useless spray and a rhubarb crucifix to counter them. Baines will be made to pay in his cretins, coinage I was ready to throw in the towel. That is of course a reference to the boxing ring. Last I and Emil were strangers to it. It was a different kind of box they were on

was bought behind it. I had to know but I also needed that towel just in case. And I realized I had cleaned forgotten where the airing cupboard was. I slumped in a chair and picked up my album. It would have to serve as my Emotional cushion for the time being. I opened the album at a random page, and I gazed and gazed and gazed for hours until becalmed at a photograph of rasma, salt struck the Danish cheese maker with his wife and his infant son.

I have an absolutely terrible memory. I sometimes wonder if my inability to remember things might have something to do with the ruinous departures of my wilderness years, but I suspect my forgetfulness preceded them, and that my memory was never much coffee in the first place. I barely record much of what I've written and posted on the hooting yard website or read on the radio here over the years. This morning, sorry, yesterday morning, casting about in my puny brain for a topic to write about. I thought, aha, I know. I'll write about Dobson discovering the pillow book of safe Shama gone, and deciding to write a pillow book of his own. I got as far as writing an opening line about Dobson and marigold to sitting at breakfast one fabulously dreary morning in the early 1950s. When I think ping within my bonds wholeheartedly. I've already done this, haven't I? I said to a nearby sock for one of any other interlocutor. The sock didn't reply, but a quick search of the hunting yard website confirm that, yes, six years ago, I wrote about that very thing. Anyway, maybe you lot have forgotten it as well. So here it is, again. capacious and pulsating it may have been, but Dobson's brain contained many, many pockets of ignorance. He was in his mid 50s. For example, when he first came upon the pillow book of sage Shawna gone, a work of which he had no previous inkling. He did not read it, maybe noting the title on the spine of a copy lodged on the bookshelf of his friend our Fang vendor who can drop the sino Dutch artist and mountaineer. Back at home later that day, Dobson mentioned it to marigold shoe. Did you know he said that an 11th century Japanese bent wrote an entire book about pillows. Yes, Dobson. Of course, said marigold true. I've borrowed it from the mobile library more than once and read it from cover to cover. Speaking of the mobile library, said Dobson, and he embarked on a long winded and petty fogging digression upon the mobile library, which in that place at that time, took before Excuse me. The mobile library, which in that place at that time, took the form of a cart pulled by an elegant yet to Burke killer dry horse, the cart piled high with hardbacks covered in grease proof paper jackets for dry horse trivia on its way by an equally elegant and equally to Burke EULA library and carta a man of grim countenance and terrible personal habits, who bore a distinct resemblance to the act of Carl Johnson noted for his roles as elderly and grubby peasant Twister Terrell in Lark rise to candleford and as vidkun Stein in Derek Jarman's film vidkun Stein. In fact, it may even have been cold Johnson himself. moonlighting as a mobile librarian, to supplement his thespian earnings. Dobson posited this possibility, but doubted it was true, as we too must doubt it until all the evidence is in. Some implacable was the pamphlet is babbling that marigold crew was unable to get a word in edgewise and was thus given no opportunity to point out to Dobson that the pillow book of safe Sean I gone By all pivo books was not actually a book about pebbles, but a collection of lists and aphorisms and observations and jottings, and poems and opinions and anecdotes. Had he ceased prattling for batum moment, Dobson would have learned this and not when eventually he exhausted the topic of the mobile library, and the greaseproof paper jacket and the dry horse and the librarian Carter and the actor and the fictional peasant and the non fictional philosopher and hospital Porter gone scurrying of this escrow tois to sit and scribble the following.

I have learned that 1000 years ago, a woman from the land of Yoko Ono wrote an entire book about pillows, such as human progress, then in the intervening millennium, there must be much, much more to be said on the subject. Clearly, I am the pamphleteer to take on this daunting task, I shall set to work on the pillow book of Dobson as soon as I have taken a nap, and be the nap will of course be research for my pillow book, as I shall be resting my head upon a pillow while I nap, and I will present my findings as soon as I wake up. As far as we know, the promised findings were never written down. So refreshed was Dobson by his nap, that upon waking he immediately put on his Iberian duck hunters boots, grabbed an owl punch doc in his fist, and set out for a jaunty hike. That took him past the electricity pylons and the abandoned swimming pool and the Badger rescue station and the allotments. All the while he hiked, he concentrated his mind on pillows 1000 years of pillows. His brave revealed as he struggled to comprehend the sheer amount of material he would have to marshal in the making of his pillow book. What advances mankind must have made in the field of pillows since the 11th century. How many heads and rested on how many pillows in that time? How many dreams dreamt during pillow assisted dozers and maps and even comas, pausing for a breather outside the bolted on shattered off license. Dobson suddenly felt intimidated by the scale of the task before him. He watched the skies for Swift's and sparrows and starlings and other birds beginning with S. He rattled the bolt on the off licence door. He chucked it out punch doc into a ditch. And then he turned for home, resolved to write not a pillow book, but a whole series of pillow pamphlets, each to tackle a single manageable subsection of his vast, unwieldy subject matter. marigold, he announced bustling through the door. I have had a brainwave with regard to my working methods on the pillow project. I did not know you had embarked upon a pillow project Dobson said marigold true. And what have you done with the Alpine stock? Oh, I kept it into a ditch that Dobson I shall go and retrieve it later. But first, I must write out the plan for my pillow pamphlets, updating 1000 views of pillow history since Shai Shana gone, wrote her book about pimozide Long, long ago in faraway Japan. But so exhausted was the pamphleteer by his hiking and his brain activity, that before sitting at his desk, he took another nap, he's asked set a pattern for what was to follow. Every time he determined to set to work on the pillow pamphlet. He convinced himself that further practical pillow research was necessary, and made his head upon a pillow and fell asleep. And that's all we have time for this week. I hope you've enjoyed hooting yard all around my hat or hooting yard, what is it good for, or whatever it's called. I'll be back next week. Bye bye
