Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. And this is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for about half an hour. There's much in the news these days about the credit crunch, but this shouldn't lead us to neglect many other important crunches. I sometimes worry that less attention is paid to some crunches because they lack the alliterative quality of the credit crunch, which of course makes it a favor of headline writers and broadcasters. Actually, it's not quite true that I sometimes worry about this. If truth be told my fretfulness about neglected crunches and starting to consume my every waking thought. Yesterday, for example, I was standing on a bridge staring off into the distance buffeted by a gale. And all I could think of was the fact that the credit crunch is pushing some of my preferred crunches off the front pages. I don't have any useful media connections. or to be more precise, my people don't have any connections with their people. So it's not as if I can just send a few metal Tapping Machine messages to selected newspaper crunch reporters and put pressure on them to cover other crunches. With that I could. What I did instead, yesterday was to trudge disconsolately home and to spend a fruitful few hours studying pebble heads best selling paperback, the bumper book of crunches. I can recommend this fantastic and very fat book to anyone who seeks to broaden their knowledge beyond the credit crunch. It's packed with crunchy fact crunchy anecdotes, crunchy illustrations, crunchy diagrams, and even its very own cleverly crafted crunchiness.

Last week, on the program, I read out a letter that I had received from a wooden child and he's been badgering me to feature more of his writings on the show. I've been inundated with screeds all of which I've heartlessly chucked down the clanking refuse chute at the side of my escrow tois however, I've decided to indulge him because his latest missive is quite interesting. Here it is. Dear Mr. Key, it may surprise you to know that despite being a wooden child abandoned to a Mercy Home nestled deep in the gloomy woods, I'm a voracious reader, and a keen user of my local library. Well, it's not exactly local, given that it's located far away beyond the sinister purple hills that loom at the edge of the woods. But I regularly scamper over there when allowed out of the Mercy Home by the Beadle. On my most recent visit, I was delighted to find a copy of a scholarly work by dot tinte entitled on the vampiric sea shanties of ancient pointy town. You may be familiar with this book, which takes a forensic approach to the surprisingly blood sucking subject matter of many of the sea shanties sung by the Mariners who sailed from point to town harbor in days of yore. It took a blue stocking of dots tense perspicuity, to winnow from these almost forgotten songs, insights into matters which have great resonance for us today, such as poop deck vampires, the dilution of blood with bilge water, and the credit crunch. I know you worry about other neglected crunchies. But stick with me here, if only because I have my wooden finger on the pulse. Not on my own pulse, obviously, because I do not have one being wooden. I refer to the pulse and throb of our contemporary urban Hurly burly, which I keep tabs on Despite living in rustic squalor, far from any town or city. The tabs I use Incidentally, are made of tin or plastic, but they're coated with a wood veneer so that they do Not look out of place in my otherwise totally woody environment. The beetle does not take kindly to non wood materials, arguing quite justifiably that we wouldn't tinies might go crackers if exposed for any length of time to concrete say or rubber. Anyway, about the dot tint book, I got it date stamped at the library desk and put it in my Pipi bag and trot it out into the bewildering sunshine. The library is in a little village called blanket by the Blears were on the day I'm telling you about a Saturnalia was taking place I fancy to go the potato shy, which was like a fairground coconut shy except with potatoes instead of coconuts. I slipped some wooden coin Adrian to the poor of the store holder, and in return, he gave me three chunks of wood to throw at the potatoes. This was going to be fun. I put down my Pipi bag and throw a chunk of wood to dislodge a potato from it stick successfully and throw another chunk of wood to dislodge another potato from it stick again successfully. And then I threw another chunk of wood at another potato to dislodge it from it stick. And again I did so successfully. And that was the end of my go. The potato shy stallholder congratulated me and drew aside a tatty curtain to one vial a pile of prizes, from which I was invited to take my pick. After rummaging about for a bit. I chose a canister containing a brand new print of the first reel of Antony new Lee's 1969 film can Hieronymus Merkin ever forget mercy hump and find true happiness. I seminal influence on the young David Bowie. I resolved at once to coat the canister in wood veneer before letting the Beatle clap his eyes on it and stooped to stash it in my Pipi bag, but my Pipi bag was gone. What kind of monster would steal a pity bag from an inattentive wooden

child. The worst of it was, of course, that the library copy of dot tints on the vampiric sea chanteys ancient pointy town was in the bag, and so had vanished with it. I had always been very conscientious about returning my borrowings on time, and unsullied, free of marmalade smears or doggy ears or any of the other business merchants to which library books for prey went in the wrong hands. I've even been promised a good borrower badge by the librarian, a signal honor for an inmate of the Mercy Home for abandoned wooden children. I've been so looking forward to coating my badge with wood veneer and buffing it to a shine with a rag. Now, unless I was able to retrieve my Pipi bag, and with it the book, I would be in bad odor with the library and end up with the stigma of a bad borrower bag. instead. I shoved the film canister under my arm and looked wildly about. The Saturnalia was getting up steam and the normally quiet Village Square of Blunkett bother Blears was a scene of Mayhem and disorder crowded with mounted banks and revellers masked maniacs Presta digitated, capering dizzy heads, and unsupervised farmyard animals, including hens and cows. I cursed that I had never thought to personalize my puppy bag by sewing onto it some brightly colored beads and buttons. Not the needle work of any standard is among my accomplishments, but I could at least have splashed some paint onto it or beribboned it with ribbons. Alas, it was about a featureless done Pepe bag like $10,000 and I was at a loss as to how I might track it down in the midst of a Saturnalia. I slumped down in the boarded up doorway of what had once been the villages respect party headquarters, and held my wooden head in my wooden hands. It is at times like this that I taste the bitter goal of honor suede durable despair. For me, it has a woody taste, which I could liken to a creosoted fence post in the rain. Just to give you some idea. I was deaf and blind to the Saturnalia and antics around me smothered in self pity and misery. Even my potato shy prize held no a little for me. And I tip the film canister upright, gave it a shove and let it run. roll away along the gutter. I watched as it clattered to a halt at the feet of a Crone. She bent to pick it up and brought it back to me in my doorway, and she spoke. what ails the youthful person of wood? she asked. If I'd had my eyes shot, I would have thought I was being spoken to by the young Joan Greenwood is sibella Holland in kind hearts and coronets 1949. Or more accurately, Joan Greenwood with a mouthful of Brazil nuts. No doubt such distortion was on account of the great age of the Crone who looked to be at least 10 score years and 10 if she was a day. I am very skilled at judging age in people and trees and milk and birds and the smaller mammals. Once or twice, I've been called on by the police to assist them in the dating of evidence, notably in a strangling case, which gave me the shivers. So I'm fantastically confident that the Crone was indeed as ancient as she looked unlikely as that may seem, with age comes wisdom. And I felt immediately that this Uber wrinkled kindly old Biddy would somehow be able to help me, so I told her of my travails, but not in so much detail, that she would grow fractious, and thump me into silence. That kind of thing has happened to me in the past, I'm afraid to say, for I can get carried away with my woes when I taste the bitter goal of Anna suede horrible despair. I have learned through experience that travails are best narrated as a kind of sprightly anecdotes. So that's the approach I took, and it paid off. The Crone tilted her ancient head in an attentive manner. And when I was done, she bent down and took my little wooden hand and lifted me with uncanny strength to my feet. Usual Come with me, she announced. And don't forget your film canister.

Some people would describe what happened next is being taken out of their comfort zone. This is not the sort of zone I have. Back at the Mercy Home I have a cornflakes zone where I eat hearty breakfast, and a compost zone where I wallow in rotting celery stalks and potato peelings to pass the time. And I have quite a few other zones, which I'll tell you about in a separate letter. The Zone I was taken to by the Crone was I suppose, best described as a cavernous a secret underground headquarters zone, which was quite a novelty for sheltered wouldn't child like me. It was alive with the buzz and Clank and hiss of activity, but so dark that I couldn't see a thing. I was pleased that the crowd was still holding my hand. I asked her where we were, and what was going on. This, she said, is the nerve center or hub of my crime busting organization, I bust more than crime. But the popular press caused me the crime busting chrome and it's a title I have learned to live with, even though I also bust wickedness and shirking and health and want of decorum and lack of gravitas, punctilious and rectitude among many other despicable blots on civic loveliness. Here in the subterranean gloom, my facto tie are busy busting such blots, and I shall find one who is idle, and set them to work to recover your Pipi bag and your library book and bring the malefactor to justice. White here she let go of my hand and disappeared into the gloom, though she creaked loudly as she moved so I was able to tell more or less where she was headed. I didn't know quite how to conduct myself, so I went all floppy and clattered to the ground, which was covered in oleum. It seemed to be a very well appointed cavernous secret underground headquarters zone, despite the lack of light. I've wondered about the crime busting, krones facto tie. If they were some sort of blind stunted troglodyte hoard. It was certainly within the bounds of reason. After all, that earlier, crime buster, Sherlock Holmes had his Baker Street irregulars, and they were not exactly polished in their manners. I am polished By the way, very much so. Eventually, the chrome returned, accompanied by a factotum. I got to my feet and studied as best I could, the person charged with retrieving my Pipi bag But he or she, it was but a blur in the darkness. This is fact tota Miliband said the Crone, I have every confidence in in him, and I have no doubt that he will solve the case. Just now for example, excited about Fluxus in CPU load, as Cicero put it, he was stirring up billows in a ladle, there will be more bellows before the day is out. Now tiny person of wood hop up onto his back. Being a biddable sought I did as I was bid. And once I was secure, Miliband lumbered off taking huge strides further and further into the cavernous secret underground headquarters zone, until all around me was pitch black and strangely, compellingly muffled. I had complete trust in this mysterious blurry factotum. So I sort of snuggled up against him, wedging the film canister between my head and his back as a pillow and fell asleep. The beetle would have been livid if he knew I was using a tin pillow, fearing ineradicable contamination. So before dozing off, I beg for forgiveness for my weird wooden gods, and I clutched the little girl's bag on a lanyard around my neck for luck. I'm not particularly superstitious, but I must admit, it gave me some comfort inside the bag with a teeth of an otter, a sprig of parsley, and a passport photograph of Beaune from ABA. Or it might have been Benny I could never remember which was which, whichever one it was, the snap had been taken in the late 1970s. At the height of the group's success, and buehner Benny was wearing a polo neck sweater. I hadn't chosen the contents of my lucky golf bag on a lanyard myself. For years I didn't even know what was in it. But one day, while I was mooching about over by the collapsed birdseed silo near sawdust bridge football stadium,

I peeked Inside Out of curiosity. It was a turning point in my life. Some of the abandoned wooden children at the Mercy Home also wear such bags on lanyard around their necks, and the only thing that ever keeps me awake at night is wondering if their bags to contain otters teeth and parsley, and passport photographs of Scandinavian pop legends in Polo neck sweaters I've never dared to ask. Also look, and always after such sleepless nights, I remind myself that I can do without any more melodramatic turning points. from darkness to light. My hand was still wrapped around my lucky golf bag on a lanyard when I woke up beneath the breathtaking sky and expansive billowing clouds. The crime busting crown had promised me billows so this was a good sign. But when I lifted my wooden head from its 10 pillow, I was disconcerted to find myself back in the boarded up doorway of the respect party headquarters. There was no sign of Miliband gone to wear the robes and mad caps of the Saturnalia. The Village Square was deserted, and I was alone and chill under the billows without my Pipi bag and my dot tense library book. Then, just as the creosoted fence post taste of the bitter goal of Anna suede Rubble, despair rose in my throat. a post office Starling flew past and dropped an envelope into my lap. I am unreasonably fascinated by stamps, so I paused to examine the one affixed to the letter that was clearly addressed to me. how thrilled I was to see that it was the maroon six painting stamp from a series of Rex tent mezzotint reproductions, depicting in gorgeous detail. The mezzotint is himself at work in his studio, and visible through the Prussian windows, a buskey hillside dappled with laughing cows, similar to the cheese triangle laughing cows, but done in a Soviet realists style. It was certainly one to collect. So if I was careful when soaking it off the envelope later, I would have almost half a dozen stamps in my album shuffling backwards to take to make myself more comfortable in the doorway. I took out the letter with my trademark fastidiousness and folded it and read. Deal wouldn't child be not faint of heart and Do not weep when I tell you that factotum Miliband has been on it To recover your Pipi bag and library book, in spite of being a mute, blind, stunted troglodyte, he is surprisingly resourceful in the open air above ground, and I am sure he would have succeeded had not circumstances been against him. Neither he nor I could have predicted that those circumstances would have been loopy, indeed, Dotty. I shall not go into detail except to say that we live in a loopy Dotty world and the sooner you reconcile yourself to the fact the better. Daily contemplation of pigs in a pigsty can be extremely beneficial in this regard, but all is not lost. As I write factotum Miliband is smashing his way into the library via a concealed side entrance. And once inside, he will create a scene of havoc and destroy any evidence that you have ever borrowed a copy of on the vampiric see shanties of ancient pointy town by dot tent. So you need never fret that you will have to pay a fine or being bad odor with the librarian. me. Excuse me. Meanwhile, factotum Miliband brother, also known as factotum, Miliband is hard at work in the needlework section of my crime busting hub, stitching together a brand new Pepe bag for you, which will be sent by post office styling to the Mersey home.

I have given him instructions to sow the Mercy Home for abandoned wooden children monogram in the correct place on the bag. So unless the beetle looks at it with a microscope, it should easily pass for the genuine article. Do let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Yours till the cows come home. The crime busting Crone. So there you have it, Mr. Key. I'd been hoping to write a review of Tim's book for you, but it will have to wait for another time. Incidentally, I've taken the Crown's advice and I now spend at least four hours a day contemplating pigs in a pigsty with the Beatles blessing. I will happily write an account of my ruminations for you should you wish, as I'm sure that all hooting yard listeners would enjoy a regular dose of my witterings blissfully yours, anonymous wooden child.

A number of listeners have written in asking me what's happened to the sometimes popular hooting yd character Captain cake. Captain cake had gone to see in a battered and leaking ship. He drank his grog from a Bakelite cup. When he walked upon me all up deck he sang in Vulgar Latin, and every morning he made the sailors prayer matins. The boson had a voodoo doll pierced with many pins, but Captain cake had a jacket made of tin and he made the boat and walk the plank till he fell into the churning see all the sailors rollick with glee. So Captain cake sat in his cabin reading a book about Gould's then I landed on an island of bloodthirsty hordes, the purser trap Voodoo pins that the leader of these folk who put down his sword and began to choke Captain cake wanted to be the Ireland King, but they already had a gold with bright and fluffy wings, and the God made the captain bow down on the sand. So, if you sail the hectic seas, be sure to understand that leaking ships can run aground at the drop of a hat. If only Captain k could realize that.

And I'll end as as as is becoming the standard thing on the show with a couple of quotes from other writers. The first quote is from the tacky pump by Edward page Mitchell. And this quotation is for pansy cradle drew because it mentions an array and she's very keen on arrays, this parently this is from the tacky pump. The four corners of the room were occupied, respectively by a turning lave, a rum coffee coil, a small steam engine, and an array in stately motion, tables, shelves, chairs and floor supported an old aggregation of tools, retorts, chemicals, gas receivers, philosophical instruments, boots, flasks, paper colored boxes, books diminutive and books of preposterous size. There were plaster bust of Aristotle, Archimedes and comped while a great drowsy owl was blinking away perched on the benign brow of Martin Farquhar, tapa. And, finally, this week, a more a more up to date quotation. This one is from a retired lieutenant general William Boykin of the US Army. addressing a conference of apocalyptic Christian Zionist earlier this month, and marvelous stuff, really listen to this. Here's the way I want to show up at the gates of heaven. I want to come skidding in there on all fours. I want to be slipping and sliding, and I want to hit the gates of heaven with a bang. And when I stand up, when I stand before Christ, I want there to be blood on my knees and my elbows. I want to be covered with mud. And I want to be standing there with a ragged blessed breastplate of righteousness and a spear in my hand. And I want to say, Look at me, Jesus. I've been in the battles. I've been fighting for you. Nothing really to add. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
