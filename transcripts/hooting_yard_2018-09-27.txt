Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. And I'm going to read to you for about 28 and a half minutes or thereabout. First of all, I'll put my extremely powerful reading glasses on. And this is a tale of don't plow, like clapped me and ions and read me my rights. Or perhaps it was the other way around. Maybe the clapping and the reading happened at the same time. I can't be clear. The day was so hot, the sunlight so bright, the meadow so the spattered with butter cups, and here and there a dumb stupid cow. I could not think straight. In any case, they read my rights to me in a wholly unfamiliar language, guttural and seemingly lacking in vowels. Then they shoved me into the back of a van and slammed shut the door. We drove for several hours over the mountain pasture didn't plow. I only learned this later. At the time I had no idea where we were going. There were three other miscreants in the back of the van with me, but they were clueless. They had also been trapped in irons, and what is dumb and stupid as the cows I had left behind in the meadow. I soon gave up my attempts at conversation. Instead I studied their heads for evidence of criminality. I have often found friend knology or capital way to pass the time. When we arrived at the police station in dubrow, we were bumbled out of the van and read through a door along a filthy curry door and through another door and another curry door less filthy, and I'll get on with it. We ended up in an interrogation room. Well, I did. Perhaps the other three were taken to their own interrogation rooms. Perhaps they were shot. I don't know. On that day, and the next I must have answered thousands of questions. All my replies were spirited and perky, for I was keen to make the right impression, and to help them with their inquiries. The chief interrogator who spoke my language with an accent I would have found amusing in any other circumstances, was a dwarf. I thought he had a criminal shape to his head, but did not say so. From time to time, he was joined by a colleague, no dwarf he by golly, but this fellow stayed silent and seemed more interested in contemplating the tulips in a vase on the window sill. The window itself had been covered over by a poster of the type sold by Athena in the 1970s. It was upside down. The questions held at me ranged over the entirety of my life from before birth up to the moment just before I was collapsing ions. He was a very thorough dwarf. He took no written notes, but tapped his fingertips upon his temple every now and then, as if lodging what I said in his memory. his trousers were of the drain pot variety for what it's worth, and issues were of Blue Suede. He did a lot of strutting to and fro. As he fired his questions, rarely bothering to look at me. I remained perky. Midway through the second day, there came the rules and flashes of a thunderstorm so terrible and violent, that all of us may and the dwarf and the tulip warrior were cowed. We sheltered under a table, much as James Joyce did, when so storm frightened in shaving England in 1917. Once the storm ceased, and I was back in my chair, and the dwarf was strutting, and the other cat had left the room to fetch some baby bio for the crew lips, my interrogation lost its focus. The dwarf started asking increasingly irrelevant and even in comprehensible questions from details of my life his attention now passed to such matters as the Munich air disaster, the Tet offensive. JOHN major's traffic cones hotline, none of which I had had any involvement in as far as I could remember.

Frank Key  05:16
Honest Guv. But he was relentless like a swordfish. I found it harder and harder to remain perky. Eventually I snapped. I interrupted the dwarf in the middle of a question which, as far as I could ascertain, result revolved none too steadily around the circumstances of the raid on Entebbe and ask the question myself. Would it be at all possible Captain I said, at this stage in the interrogation, given my cooperation and compliance thus far, not to mention my perkiness and eagerness to help you with your inquiries? Would it be possible for my ions to be uncapped, or D clapped, or whatever the correct terminology is for the process, for they are chafing most miserably Captain he could not stop himself from sputtering out the rest of his senseless question, but we both knew he did not expect a reply. He gathered himself like Kate Winslet at an award ceremony, stress into the door, opened it and shouted out for to the man to bring the IMD clapping key. They released me late in the afternoon after giving me a cup of tea and a sandwich filled with some sort of god awful, reconstituted fish paste substitute. I would be hearing from them in due course, I was told, but I was free to go so long as I made no attempt to leave Don't plow. If I took a single step beyond the town limits, I would be hanged from the highest of the many cubits and crows would feast on my end trails. Understood, Yes, Captain. And so I missed out of the police station into the gorgeous air of don't plow, windy and overcast with drizzle. From now on and forever after, it would be my home. Wild was the don't plow wind. I heard the sound of didn't plow mandolins

Here is another story astute listeners may begin to sense a theme. I was born in dunt Blau above the wall shop at the beginning of our night that lasts for half a year. The alignment of the stars in the sky overdone to plow did not argue well. Shortly after my birth, the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman paid her visit creaking up the fire escape to my parents flat above the woodshop. She cast her twigs and pebbles upon the floor and described signs in the steam rising from her bowl of boiling Duck's blood. She announced that though I was not exactly a cursive child, still, I was a taught inwardly humbled morally and comprehensively. There was no force in the universe that could ever come to my aid and cure me. Mama pulled the ducks blood down the drain while papar paid the Whoo hoo hoo the woman has stipend as she creaked away down the fire escape my infant wailing woke every sleeping Solon didn't plow. Three decades and three more years passed with little or nothing of remark. Until one day Paul called me down to the back room of the woodshop Sean Biko he said, You have now reached the age of Christ Jesus was when he was so cruelly nailed to his cross. It is time you left don't plow to make your own way in the world. I begged for part or allow me to postpone my leaving for six months when there would be daylight again, but his mind was made up. I was to quit the wall shop immediately and don't plow as soon as possible thereafter as I made Instead of the door, Mama handed me, us, us. As I minced out of the door, my mom handed me a snack and a bag of whatnot. When I was out of sight of the wall shop, I collapsed onto the pavement and ate my snack, a fish paste world and a plum. Then I rummage through the whatnots in the bag, but my fingers were sticky, so I took the contents onto the pavement, the better to grasp liquidities suddenly, dozens of birds swoop from the don't plow sky, grabbing the wotnot in their beaks and soaring away, up up until I vanished into the black starless night. After a while I rose to my feet and continued along the street, or rather Boulevard. This was one of the main thoroughfares of Central don't plow and was named after Dave Dee, dozy beaky, Mick and take huge cement statues of whom stood upon tawdry plinth at intervals from east to west. It so happened that a couple of steps past the beaky statue where I had snapped and had my whatnots obstructed by birds, there was an alleyway leading off the boulevard to the left. And down this alleyway was the kiosk of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. I was minded to go and have a word with her. But just as I was readying my legs to make the required turn, I was set upon by an assignment. It was not the first time in my 33 years to heaven, that I felt the battery of a bludgeon on my bonds. Violence stalks don't plow in the Long Night, but I had never before been knocked unconscious for such a protracted period of time. When I came to sprawled in the gutter, I heard that to some bangs and bellowing of improvised Impaler band music, and saw the masked Patty and mash a puppet of bow noteworthy is being carried aloft. It was the saints bibbity Dibs Day Parade. I must have been lying in the gutter for a fortnight. I knew Papa would expect me to be a lot further away by now possibly gone from don't plow entirely. I knew too that he was likely to employed the private detectives Perkins and throwback to scour the street for any sign of me. He was that kind of papaya rigorous, right just mad. I had to make myself scarce.

Frank Key  12:49
I scuttled off down an alleyway. It was a different daily way to the one where the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman had her kiosk. But there is that old saying in don't plow or alleyways, something something but something a hyper for a kiosk. Above me. The shroud of knights lay heavy upon the souls of embittered men and their warm pale wives. The alleyway was scattered with dust bins and corrugated cardboard and dead or dying kittens. A dribbling salt worked in a doorway, shaking his fist at nothing. I pulled up my collar as I passed him by how does that song go? I pulled up my collar as I passed him by little suspecting he was a private I either Perkins or throwback, hired by my dad, the end of this story is going to be sad. The end of this story is going to be sad. No longer failing Scottishness and the dribbling that accompanies it. Perkins or it might have been throwback, grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled a sack over my head. I was overcome by the Pong of bladderwrack. The Private Eye prodded me in the back and told me to start walking so sightless. I walked or tottered, Perkins or throwback, guiding me like a dog. Also, like a dog, indeed, so much like a dog that it actually was a dog was a dog that started trotting alongside us after we had been walking for, I don't know, call it a few miles. At some point, we began to go up hill at a steeper and steeper gradient. I was panting the dog would yapping Perkins or throwback seemed tireless, having a varied selection of tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein Rodgers and Hart Leiber and Stoller brachten, Isla Ashford and Simpson Flanders and Swann, golf, Ian and King and Holland Dozier Holland Dozier Dozier Holland Holland Dozier Holland Dozier, Dozier Holland. Eventually we stopped the private eye and muttered something menacing, and I heard him trudging away. When I thought it's safe to do so, I pulled the sack off my head and looked around. We were high up in an important mountain range muffled by snow and ice, and a thick, swirling freezing mist or white nothingness. The dog could stop yapping and was gazing up to me adoringly toto I said, I've a feeling we're not in don't burn out anymore.

I'm here with another title of don't plow, although the first person narrator of this one is a different narrator to the narrator of the second one, who was in fact a different narrator to the first one. But this is tales of don't plow number three. It has been said that the sky above don't plow is rife with formatters, but I have never seen one. And I have gazed up at that sky for hours. more hours than I can count. Lying on my back on a lawn outside a hotel, searching for four miles. It's what I do. Nobody pays me now about this hotel. It is you know what, quite honestly, what do you expect me to say about a hotel in don't bow? It's not as if I've ever stayed in it. I doubt they would let me in in my fetid rags, without a hat to my name and the width of sour and the width of soup gone bad on mine breath. I read somewhere a recipe for for more soup. As I recall, you first had to obtain a brace of four miles, which is easier said and done. Particularly if there is not a single one to be seen in the sky above the hotel you're lying on the lawn outside of I think my grammar is impeccable where I wouldn't swear to it. Not that anybody is likely to make me the recipe was in a book called 26 bird based soups. I seem to recall it was an A to Zed of birds, but I don't remember what the other 25 were. Whether a was for orc or albatross B for budgerigar or banana quit. You can fill in the rest with the aid of a dictionary of Ornithology if you have one, or from whole cloth. If you haven't. I don't have a dictionary of Ornithology, but I'm working on a dictionary of hotel lawns. Not all hotels have lawns attached. Did you know that? But the one in don't cloud did. I often lie on it looking up at the sky hoping to spot a former. That is the hotel door and I have started to write the entry for in my dictionary. Others will follow. I hope to interest a publisher. publishers are a funny lot. They used to be men wearing tweed and smoking pipes. Now they all seem to be 12 year old girls. Do they even know what a full mark is? I can't remember how old I was when first I learned about four miles, possibly eight. We had a teacher at my primary school who was simply mad about birds. He was mad about a few other things too, like kings and queens and cornflakes. He was meant to be teaching us forensic criminology, but he was always getting carried away with his pet subject. I think he was drafted to Vietnam and killed it the case and birds have often played an important part in wars, particularly pigeons. What valiant birds, they risk their little lives for us with no hope of reward save the occasional handful of millet is a curious fact that lying on the lawn outside the hotel and don't plow, gazing at the sky, not only have I never seen a former, but nor have I ever spotted a pigeon, and at least I'm 100% sure what they look like which I have to admit is not quite true of full miles. The precise lineaments of which I have never been certain not even when I was eight and Mr. Una new gu raved about them during several forensic criminology lessons in a row, Thursday afternoons at 215. Life held such promise then, I was an eager pupil of the world light before me rich and ripe with possibilities. I had yet to discover grin and floozies and hi debauch

take a quick break from now and instead I'd like to read you something from annals of fruit. This is not by me. This is an extract from a memoir which I will tell you what it is. When I finished reading the extract the sun is a ball of flames. It feels like a torrid Southern summer I can see a port, people are struggling in the shade of the high harbour walls. Shop doors are open wide. aromas of tropical fruit fill the air with their fragrance. Peaches, oranges, apricots, raisins, cloves, and pepper all give off their wonderful sense. The asphalts beans after being sprayed with water, I can hear the strident guttural tones of Persian merchants offering their wares Oh my god. How marvelous It smells here have pleasant is the tropical air. Suddenly my foot tripped over my ski pole. I quickly steadied myself against the kayak opened my eyes wide, and was dazzled by the sun. For a moment I did not know where I was. What had happened to my tropical port. Our devil had I been transported to this icy wasteland. What happened? asked my companions. Nothing I answered. I tripped over my pole. The boreal landscape unfolded once more before me in an infinite expanse, and the sun which fleetingly brought me such joy, now sought only to blind and torture me. Yet the hallucination did not completely vanish. My nose was still filled with the aromas of Mediterranean fruit. My companions were not conscious of my present condition. What did it mean? Was I ill, I shut my eyes tight. Once again, I was like an automaton moving rhythmically with the pole in my right hand. And once again, I could hear the monotonous tune, far to go so very far. But what I had just experienced continued to trouble me. For strangely enough, I had never liked those aromatic fruits, they had never tempted my palate. And that's extracted from in the land of white death, an epic story of survival in the Siberian Arctic, by Valerian, our bernoff, published in English in by Pimlico, in 2001. And it's a terrific story about a completely stupidly organized track through the land of white death without maps, without maps or any kind of navigation equipment that works, and with very few supplies, and yet Valeria and Alberto survived to write his memoir.

That's all we have time to read on hooting yard on the air this week. If I begin reading something else, I'll be interrupted by the the now of doom, which is 630. And I don't want to be interrupted. I do recommend that you go and visit hosting yard.org a website where you will find 15 years, yes, 15 years worth of writing, quotations, pictures, all sorts of stuff. It would take you months. I think to go through it. There's probably more than a million words there. hooting yd.org And remember, while you were there you can you have the opportunity to buy several paperback books, one hardback book, one ebook. So you could buy all of those in one fell swoop. Or you could just make a donation that always comes in handy. So if you'd like to go to hunting yard, you'd be most welcome to do so. And pansy cradle jury's with me today. pansy. Do you have anything to say to the world?

Unknown Speaker  26:37
Well, I'm not sure I do. Although you are mentioned of the white land, the white

Frank Key  26:42
Land of the white dead land

Unknown Speaker  26:43
or the white death reminded me of the Arctic trip was it Shackleton's group where they carried things such as canteen of cutlery,

Frank Key  26:52
and I think it may have been And do you remember the box of buttons,

Unknown Speaker  26:57
a box of buttons, the canteen of cutlery

Frank Key  26:59
a copy of the vicar of Whitefield? That's all of a goldsmith. Central gear for me polar crack the vicar of Whitefield. Yes. And

Unknown Speaker  27:34
It occasionally does happen to me. I'm not knitting now, and I'm talking to you. But have you Have you discussed this because I thought that might be

Frank Key  27:46
Oh, they Yes, there's a great video on YouTube a 10 hour train ride to the Norwegian Arctic. They put a camera in the front of the train. And that's it. The only sound is the sound of the train. And it lasts for 10 hours. I have so far watched nine of those hours and let me tell you, I was utterly mesmerized. I think that is the end of hooting out on the air for this week. We've been it's been a pleasure this week for the show to be produced not by Johnny seven who is unfortunately, at home sick with some unseemly ailment. But producer today was the one and only Ed Baxter. So very thanks very much Ed. I don't know if you have anything you'd like to say. Now he's shaking his head and his lips are closed, his lips are sealed. So that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I hope to be back next week. weather permitting
