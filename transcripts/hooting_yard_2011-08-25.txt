That was a really groovy station identical, isn't it? This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key on resonance, which you know, because you heard that groovy iden and this week I'm going to continue reading obsequies for last calc struck by lightning. This is a lengthy piece from 1994. The last really considerable piece of prose that I wrote before, what we know euphemistically as the wilderness years, which lasted from about 1994 to 2000 and Walter the early 21st century, when I returned to the fray obstacles for Lost Ark struck by lightning was published in an edition of 25 copies of and it's never been republished in any form. A couple of extracts have possibly appeared on the hooting yd website, but the entire text has never been republished. So only 25 people, one of whom is may have ever read this. So you're getting to hear the whole thing in weekly episodes as long as it takes. And we'll carry on now with chapter three, which begins with Lars tout, writing in his journal obsequies for last tauk struck by lightning chapter three. Thursday, he wrote in his journal, I could not stomach breakfast. Many reproached me, she has been hiding my socks again, God blaster. Today I found them in the coal shed after an hour's search an hour, I could have better spent mulling over buchs latest clue, which seems to be utterly without meaning. I spent much of the morning polishing off my paper on musketry. The post brought an anonymous letter, accusing me of having joined the club by dint of intrigue and threatening exposure unless I paid on unwarrantable sum of money into a secret bank account. I told her letter to shreds in fury exposure intrigue didn't. After lunch, as I was about to settle for some serious beauty related musings, I was further distracted by a visit from Chod. Apparently, I was meant to have completed by today, the design for the new electromagnetic operators museum tickets. The opening is next month, and before then the committee has to approve my design and get billions of the confounded things printed. I admitted to trolled that this task could completely slipped my mind. I do not know why on earth I was asked but to show willing effect from the crate in the goose shed my simplified ticket design handbook and also dug out a few rough sketches I had made last time I designed some tickets for the small Zoo railway about 40 years ago. Chod was contemptuous his small flat is which poke out from his head or the grotesque angle turned purple with irritability. I badgered him for information. What size should the tickets be? How many colors were permissible, when the tickets be perforated and torn from a large sheet or pre snipped? What fonts were available? I realized I should have sorted all this information earlier and trolled realized it too and used my ignorance against me, spitting into my mahogany spittoon with the undisguised venom. One eventually i'd scribbled the design, which I thought perfectly adequate, the wording of which was admit one to the electromagnetic operators museum. The entry fee has been paid Chod had the nerve to insist that a separate design was unnecessary for the reduced rate entry fee for children. But children wonder they care for electromagnetism. It was my turn to spit but I did as I was bid with the wording admit one little tyke to the electromagnetic operators museum. It's long suffering parent has shelled out for the entry fee.

Back shut him up, roughly a thrust the designs into his limp puny hand and shoot him from the house. If the committee did not accept my designs, I raved as he retreated out of the door, then they were no better than bed wetters and whoa betide them if they were to ask me to revise my brilliant designs into which I had poured every last scintilla of my genius. trolled, muttered something which I did not hear and trudged off into the downpour. If he visits me again, I will set a pack of starving sharp Fang beasts upon him. trolled dispatched, I attempted to annihilate the image of him from my brain by undertaking some long overdue chores. I smeared wax onto the little spindle under the netting I counted toads. I pressed my hair underneath a steaming slab. Mini's cocoa tin needed a lick of paint. I recounted the toads, there were far more of them than I had realized. And they came in many different shades and sizes. I suspected that some of them were not toads at all. And as luck would have it, the reference book I duly consulted in order to settle the matter, quite fortuitously led me to decipher the next clue in buchs Trail by an unfathomable concatenation of fireworks in my head. One of those tremendous mental jam berries, which seemed to occur more and more frequently, the older I get a fact which I've discussed at length with that fraudulent old buzzard pill Shane, who lives in the apartment below, and whose pretensions as a psychoanalyst, calls me greater mirth than virtually anything else. In the twilight years of my life, beset as I am by croak creaking bones, indigestion, vipers, like tchad minis, manias, agonizing pains, which wrack my every limb, the theme buke, intermittent lock jaw, the gas bills, the cold and damp, and that peculiarly Finnish scene Keith tenebrous. Yes and ever present. The reference book I sought, all with toads of Scandinavia, sat on the shelf next to a mighty tome devoted to the history of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, fully illustrated with maps and portrayed no doubt fanciful of some of the more illustrious members of that preposterous band. I stole this book from a subscription library in Maitland, oh, half a century ago. And as far as I can recall, it has remained unread until this afternoon, casting Toad from my mind, for I suppose, a few minutes, I removed this Mountie book from the shelf and sprawled on my Davenport to bone up on the doings of a foreign policy. I was at once struck by a skillful engraving, showing these stern child features of one Captain cabbage, there was something arresting about his countenance, something at any rate, which made me want to read about his exploits. These were detailed in a chapter entitled the prestige of the Scarlet which began on the page facing the portrayed. I quote, the facts of the weird and wild adventure which befell Captain crabby john tan Caribbean island, I read, may be taken collectively as indicative of the many curious secrets awaiting solution in the vastnesses of the Arctic. They may be advanced as typical of the experiences to be met with by a white man, when set down beyond the last vestige of civilization to explore, to govern, and generally to represent law and order among a handful of consistently ignorant, intermittently violent and unbelievably superstitious natives, or they may be looked upon as just a story. But truthfully, they serve as still another illustration of the tremendous prestige of the Scarlet worn by Kanye, Canada's famous police force.

Unquote. I was hooked. yarns of derring do particularly those set in the polar regions have always appealed to me, the toads forgotten, I read on with increasing glee. I quote again, the awful character of the scenery, gigantic, barren cliffs, enormous flat tops, mountains, capped with snow and cloud, huge valleys, mothering eternal glasses, long beaches, ice, good seas, and great fuel. penetrating incredible distances into the unknown interior such scenery as one find in medieval panoramas of hell. Unquote. I read of crabbet constructing his dwelling house, storehouse and bloodshed, racing against time with the long polar night only three weeks away, and then of his discovery of the place of the big killing, and the sorcerer, who in a frenzied trance, announced that he was the creator pingo tickseed jock wrapped in hides king of the ice. At the point where crab had returned to Fort Hopton with the sorcerer in handcuffs, something in my brain went ping, and I knew I had made the leap in the dark necessary to understand the next clue in buchs. trail. Always too complex to explain. The big killing the sorcerer, the handcuffs, my mind underwent a curious topsy turvy them. As I linked these images to gunpowder grew toy flamingos, a wrench, a cupboard a bee. All of a sudden, that weird couplet of Bewkes scratched in mirror writing next to an emblem of plague by Stark and incontrovertibly all sense. I threw the book to the floor, grab the treasure map and looked at it as if for the first time. Now, it all seemed to make sense. Outside it was already dark, and the rain poured down and many had hidden my umbrella, but I no longer cared. I slammed the door behind me and walked all the way across town to the derelict orchard. buco had been there before me. a shovel was their shining, leaning against a pile of stones. I dug, dug, dug, abominable pains attacked my skeleton, but I kept on digging in the downpour down into the mud. Until past midnight, I found it last buried in the muck, a tiny crate of zinc. I pocketed it and made my way back home in the terrible blackness of the finish night. It is now half past four on Friday morning. I'm sitting in the kitchen slurping from a mug of boiling turnip extract. And the craziest before me on the table. I have a little over 24 hours to work out how to open it.

I forgot to mention when introducing chapter three of the quiz for last talk struck by lightning that it does contain many finish words and finishes not a language I speak so my pronunciation may be completely up the spat. Onwards then with chapter four. Not only had money stolen the alarm clock and thrown it into the canal, she'd also laced talc bedtime drink with a powerful narcotic. He woke up assuming it was late on Friday morning and all about the apartment sharpening pencils, putting high under the chairs stamping on beetles smearing foul smelling decoctions on his luxuriant hairstyle, gnashing his teeth, tinkering with a plastic fruit bat decoys, painting hurdles, winnowing trap, hooting, trumping a surfeit of lampreys and docking a hair. The telegram delivered by the efficient Finnish Postal Service arrived as he was in the middle of straightening his doilies. It was from bude. Two hours left to claim prize it read. If crates not opened, massive explosion will result you and everything else within 500 yard radius will be obliterated.

So that was chapter four. And, and we haven't got time for the next chapter. So this is going to go on for a few weeks, I think. I hope you'll enjoy it. I hope you're enjoying it. One thing I've noticed while reading it is that nowadays when I write something, I know that I'm going to be reading out to you on the radio. Of course, when 17 years ago when I wrote this, I have absolutely no idea that I would ever read it out. So it's kind of written for the page, rather than having been written to be recited, which I think makes a difference. It also occurs to me that there are certain words I don't know the meaning of but you know, it's of historical importance, I think. And later in the year, once I've actually re typed the whole thing, I think I may make it available again, for the first time this century as an out of print pamphlet reprinted. So that's something to look forward to. Meanwhile, you can always go to the hooting od website. I'm sure you know where it is, by now. hooting yd.org and There's lots of other stuff there for you to read, and look at, and scroll through seven years of archives. And so go and do that. Buy some books, send me a donation. And, yes, do that. Follow the links to some other websites. You know, there's some good stuff there. Anyway, that's it for this week. I will be back with chapter five, six and possibly seven next week, where we'll learn some interesting facts about lightning. So that's something to look forward to. Bye bye.
