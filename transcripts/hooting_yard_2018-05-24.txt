How about this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Although I have to say, if you were listening to pull the plug which is just finished, which I'm sure I heard they were the last record, john played was, was carried by Zoff. And I like this kind of random mono syllabic stuff. So, you know, instead of hooting yard on the air with Frank Kay, how about I don't know. Good. With knee or something or who with ACC anyway? Yes. But as luck would have it, the first thing I'm going to read to you actually have a one syllable monosyllabic title is called gas. Or if we were in Holland, I suppose, goose but this is called this I'm going to tell you the story of gas. Gas Gus was pepped at the post. It was one of those Huffington Post's recently erected at strategic points across the land by diktat but were named in honor of puissance Huffington, the tiny orphan child, who by some inexplicable chain of accident now reigns over our realm. Nobody expected frail little puissance to rule with an iron fist, but she does. And then some. Like so many citizens gas had assumed that puissance Huffington would be a benign Queensland, with perhaps this naivety which led to his undoing. When we entered a contest in the weekly children's comic, the terrible Wrath of Christ our Savior. readers were asked to supply a caption for a drawing, which showed an innocent farmyard scene typical of our country. mischievous Gus wrote something disobligingly about a hen, unaware that every single caption submitted to the comic would be scrutinized personally by puissance Huffington. She could not read, of course, so pressed into service a man of letters who loitered somewhere in the bowels of the palace. When this sickly one legged fellow read to puissante the words written by Gus, she was outraged. I am very fond of hens, she is reported to have said, and I will not have disobligingly things said about them, no surgery. And she told the man of letters, to aim his crutches in the direction of the power get conveying instructions to have Gus arrested. And so within hours of writing his unwise words, Gus found himself chained to one of the Huffington Post in one of the less salubrious parts of the country, populated for the most part by ne'er do wells, halfwit, and called ministers. eagerly they pelted gas with pips as puissante Huffington decreed. In retrospect, we can appreciate just how fortunate Gus was to have committed his crime in the early days of the reign of puissance Huffington, for her power, made her the little money for her power made the little orphan child evermore vindictive and cruel. And it was not long before she declared that miscreants should be pelted not with pips, but with plump stones.

Frank Key  04:41
Well, this is a post I wrote a few years ago on on the hooting our blog and our about the hooting our blog at the moment is undergoing some horrible form of vindictive malevolence, still, which is proving extremely hard to eradicate. steps are still being taken. but bear with us. And the hooting God website will soon be back in all its glory. Anyway, a few years ago, I wrote a piece on there about the Pierrot deal. And the post includes a photograph of the pyramid deal on the coast of Kent. It's the last pier built in England opened in 1954, replacing a derelict 19th century predecessor at its far end, excuse me, or this fall around, it terminates in a large platform and lower than the main Pier. And from this platform on either side, a sort of a set of metal steps leads down into the sea. I think I'm right in saying that this is an unusual construction for a pair. It's a feature that sparked an idea in the brain of the writer Reiner heppenstall 1911 to 1981, who spent the last few years of his life as a resident of Dale. Early one morning, in the late 1970s, heppenstall disembarked from a boat and clambered up the steps at the end of the pier. He had come from France, brought across the candle by a somewhat rascally French sailor, who would collect him from the same spot on the evening of the same day, happens to all walks along the pier to shore and through deals dawn deserted streets to his house, he was careful to ensure he was not seen by anybody. As far as his friends and neighbors were concerned, he was on holiday in France. He spent the day very quietly at home reading over his diaries of the last few years, happened store with a diligent diary stole his life, and often use them as raw material for his fiction, after which he would destroy the originals and brought a pack ranch with him so he would not need to prepare anything and thus create cooking smells. Similarly, when he smoked during the day, he disposed, disperse the fumes and remove the evidence from his ashtray. When the cleaner came in, in the next few days, she would find no sign that happened stall had ever been there. When evening came and his neighbors had all returned home happen stall took a loaded revolver, fitted with a silencer and went next door, where he slaughtered the entire family. He then made his way back to the pier, where he was picked up from the steps at the end, and then taken back to France. Or rather, that's what he wished he'd done. Many of the entries in his diaries of the time consisted of accounts of his neighbor's behavior. They were noisy by but rambunctious they were foul mouthed. They were working class or common. Beneath the cold forensic pros, life happens tools exasperate is seething rage, and his murderousness. These are the diary entries he transformed in his last posthumously published novel, the pier 1986. I suppose it's unlikely that the noisy rambunctious working class family in deal ever read the book. When the peer appeared, it was taken as further evidence that happens to all had gone mad. Certainly, what we read is the lethal fantasy of a man driven crackers by little more than whistling games of kickabout football, loud conversation, and noisy bouts of DIY. One of the reasons he and his wife who becomes his sister in the novel, moved the deal was that their last home in London was a flat above a launderette, the Dean of which he found unbearable. Yeah, I suspect the real reason he was considered to have gone bonkers was the turn his politics took.

Frank Key  09:18
Originally from Yorkshire, heppenstall had always been a tribal labour voter, a progressive. Since the end of the Second World War, he worked as a talks producer for BBC Radio, he lived in a literary intellectual melior. In the 1930s, he shared a flat with George Orwell, who was a regular drinking companion of Dylan Thomas. He made the first translation into English of Raymond Roussel with his daughter Lindy Ford. He published several experimental novels, and in the 1960s was considered a sort of godfather by younger writers such as Anne Quinn and Bs Johnson. Both Quinn and Johnson Incidentally, committed suicide in 1973. Happened still didn't, but consider doing so. For more than three decades he kept concealed behind his bookshelves, a file of crushed pink pills diluted in water, which he regularly refreshed to maintain its potency. It was his guarantee that death was always in his reach. In the end, he never took it. He never took it. He died of a stroke. It was around the time of his retirement from the BBC in 1973. And he's moved to deal the following year, that happens all began to describe himself as a freelance reactionary. Come 1979 he even considered voting conservative, though he very probably did not vote at all. But the break from the world and the mindset he's inhabited is all too clear in some of his diary entries. It is unlikely his colleagues at the BBC canteen, or the London drinking clubs would have taken kindly to his analysis of the Middle East, which was that quote, but crews are a civilized race, whereas the Arabs are basically savages. On quote, he came increasingly to load the modern world was this madness, the reaction reviews the suicide file, the murderous fantasy. Perhaps it was something in the Aaron deal home to other London exiles, such as the alcoholic Charles Hawtrey, thrown out of every pub in town at one time or another, and Simon Raven, Autry's house bears a blue plaque, but there's no commemoration of Raina heppenstall his neighbors, the annoying children now adults and still could still be living in the same house. All I'm aware that the elderly withdrawn, Ill tempered writer who wants to live next door plotted to kill them all. I walked along the Pierrot deal yesterday, to the steps where ghost happened store came and went on his fantasy killing spree. I passed some loud, foul mouthed working class people, and also a few well dressed elderly gent taking an afternoon stroll. I wonder if I might see a small French motorboat tied up at the end of the pier. But the steps are empty, descending into the swashing. See.

Frank Key  12:50
And I'm very pleased to welcome our special guest very special guest, pansy cradle drew who's dashed back from Holland just to be with us. And I understand in Hello, pansy.

Unknown Speaker  13:03
Hello.

Frank Key  13:04
I understand when you were in Holland, you stayed in a hotel with a was it in Belgium in a hotel. And you had to share the room with a monkey wearing affairs.

Unknown Speaker  13:17
This is this is very true. This was in a in a burger hotel bed and breakfast. And it was the marionette room. Right. And the walls were covered with marionettes including the monkey wearing affairs.

Frank Key  13:32
Although it wasn't a real monkey.

Unknown Speaker  13:35
He may have been Alice, I don't know.

Frank Key  13:38
The demise monkey.

Unknown Speaker  13:39
Well. He looked like a wooden monkey. But you never know.

Frank Key  13:44
Right? To monkey

Unknown Speaker  13:46
I sort of Pinocchio monkey right

Frank Key  13:49
wearing a face. Yes. I think I'm right in saying that. That's a traditional accoutrement of all Belgian hotel rooms.

Unknown Speaker  13:57
Why not? Why not?

Frank Key  14:00
Anyway, I understand you're going to read to us. Well, I

Unknown Speaker  14:05
I am indeed, inspired by my trip to Europe, I'm going to return to a hooting yard favorite This is further science book 20 by the wonderful Norman Davies in 2001. And this is a history of Europe. One, that the history of Europe is the alternation of unity and peripheral breakup to thus the over organized Roman Empire broke down into myriad small barbarian nuclei, leading to Charlemagne unity with peripheral breakup kingdoms three leading to the new seed unity center, Holy Roman Empire to the east periphery, for which in turn broke down at the periphery. into Habsburg dominions, which spread out to marry a German and Papal States, five, leading to modern European nationalism, unity, going on to superpower unity, obviously to be followed by myriad very local, independent, etc, etc. Regions Europe wide, probably beginning at the peripheries in Britain, etc. Six, the Blair landslide, advocating regional Parliament's, etc,

Frank Key  15:37
cetera. The Blair landslide. Do you remember where you were when the Blair landslide occurred? JOHN?

Unknown Speaker  16:01
No, that was in the 90s. Wasn't it? 97. I spent most the 90s in a Cloud of

Frank Key  16:11
Unknowing the cloud in

Unknown Speaker  16:12
the Cloud of Unknowing. Yes, yeah.

Frank Key  16:15
Okay. All right. And now I this is something else I posted on the hooting yard website. Well, pretty much everything I read on here is on the website, but I called this the real world is stranger than hooting yard part 94.

Frank Key  16:41
I'm just regular I have occasionally muttered in exasperation, when the world of hunting yard is described as surreal or weird, given that the so called real world is often so much stranger. And my reader, Richard Carter, who has a blog grots, which our record wholeheartedly recommend, Richard sent me something which seemed to prove this point about the strangeness of the world. I wrote the story many years ago called songs my mother taught me and whether you remember it or not, because there's a certain thing about my, my mother, in fact, my fictional mother, in that, in that story, but to consider consider what Richard sent me, this is Neil Armstrong, not, not that Neil Armstrong, reviewing a book called secret pigeons service, Operation colomba resistance and the struggle to liberate Europe by Golden carerra. In the literary review, and in this review of the book, secret pigeon service, he writes, among others, we meet via count credit Gar, an occultist and friend of Alistair Crowley. He was for a time in charge of the section of the army that supplied m 11. Four D with birds, but was eventually caught martialed for gossiping, gossiping about operation Columbus work. his defense cited his unhappy childhood, and the fact that he's mentally ill mother had built herself a large bird's nest in the living room and sat in it, wearing a beak

Frank Key  18:55
count try to go sound with a mother. Mother thought she was a bird. It's the kind of person I wish I'd included in the Mr. Keyes shorter, potted brief, brief lives book which came out a few years ago and failed to sell. But you can still buy copies in pansy cradle. Joe is now going to read a couple of items that bring her attention.

Unknown Speaker  19:20
Well, yes, a few more real lives for you where the reality is stranger than fiction can afford. French St. 13th century should you offer prayers to send in afford, you should bear in mind that in life he was a dog, a French Greyhound to be precise, wrongly thought too heavy, no baby, going for it was killed by his master a night. But it was then discovered that he had in fact tried to save the baby from a viper realizing his error the night through the dead dog down a well and Bill To shrine around it. Local people soon began worshiping when afford and it was said he could protect infants. A contemporary chronicler described the goings on at the shrine. The local peasants hearing of the dogs noble deed and innocent death, began to visit the place and honor the dog as a martyr in quest of help for their sicknesses and other needs. They were seduced and often cheated by the devil, so that he might in his way lead men into error. Women, especially with sick or poorly children, carried them to the place and went off a leak to another nearby castle, where an old woman could teach them a ritual for making offerings and invocations to the demons and lead them to the right spot. When they got there, they offered salt and certain other things have been the child's that will close on the Bramble bushes around fixing them on the thorns. They then put the naked baby through the opening between the trunks of two trees, the mother standing on one side, and throwing her child nine times to the old woman on the other, while invoking the demons to a Jew or the Fonz and the word of rye might to take the sick and failing child, which they said belong to them, the Fonz and return to them their own child, big, plump, live and healthy one. Once this was done, the killer mothers took the baby and placed it naked at the foot of the tree on the straws of cradle lit at both ends to candles, a thumbs breath thick with fire they had brought with them and fasten them on the trunk above. Then, while the candles were consumed, they went far enough away that they could neither here nor see the child. In this way, the burning candles burned up and killed a number of babies, as we have heard from others in the same place. Although never sanctioned by the Catholic Church, the cult have persisted into the 1930s.

Frank Key  22:34
Members of the self righteous wangka community often make the boasts that they speak truth to power far more valuable I think it is my own practice of telling fibs to employee songs. For example, the other day I was prancing along the canal towpath when I saw lugging himself towards me on crutches or penulis, cripple norfund dressed in rags. Oh, boy, they're young wreck, I cried, imparting as much condescension and contempt into my words as possible. Did you know that the earth is as flat as a pancake? The hobbyhorse was baffled and distraught at this news, pleasingly So, and I continued. Not only that, but then the unicare disaster took place in 1962. The Tet Offensive with something to do with King Canute and gooseberries fall from heaven upon the wide Sargasso Sea from where they are harvested by trained coumarins. Tagging his greasy forelock, the orphan child said, Thank you kindly, sir. When I arrived at my self esteem and diversity Learning Center, I shall pass on these nuggets of wisdom in the exam paper I am sitting today you will pass with flying colors I replied. chortling inwardly as I pictured the imprisoned youth, weeping copious tears upon learning that he has failed his exam with the worst of all possible schools. Then I snatched away his crackers and pushed him into the canal before passing on to an unbelievably luxurious cafeteria for a slap up breakfast. I did not problems along the canal towpath I did not encounter a crippled orphan. I did not have a slap up breakfast.

Frank Key  25:00
Nevertheless, I do think that telling fibs to employees is much more fun than telling truth to power. And the people who say they're telling truth power usually have their own dubious agendas. And we're nearly at the end of the show. But as pansy has come all the way from Holland, and Belgium and left behind the land of monkeys in phases, she's going to read us some more potted, brief, brief lives.

Unknown Speaker  25:31
This choice was inspired by the sort of monosyllabic things we have going on. Golf exactly, which is rather a sort of theme of the show, and these have a few more syllables, but I think you'll you'll get where I'm going with this one. Ehrlich Siberian god of darkness. Ma sis blinka. In shamanism in Siberia, explained how to deal with Eric the cam, as if approaching the ureter of Ehrlich and coming into His presence, boughs, brings his drum up to his forehead, and says mergo mergo. Then he declares wince, and why he comes, suddenly he shouts. This is meant to indicate that Ehrlich is angry, and that a mortal should dare to enter his yorta. The frightened can leaps backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage, and again approaches Ehrlich's throne. After this performance has been gone through three times. Ehrlich's speaks winging it creatures cannot fly hither. beings with bones cannot come. How have you Ill smelling black beetle major way to my abode. Then the cam stoops and with his drum make certain movements, as if dipping up wine. He presents the wine to Ehrlich and makes the shuttering movement like that of one who drinks strong wine to indicate that Ehrlich has drunk. When he perceives that Ehrlich's humorous somewhat milder, he makes him offerings of gifts. Ehrlich is moved by the offerings of the cam, and promises increase of cattle declares which mare will fall and even specifies what marking the young one will have. The camera returns in high spirits, not on his horse as he went, but on a goose.

Frank Key  28:03
mugga mugga mugga mugga mugga mugga mugga is that I think that should be the new greeting every week when the job begins to say knee or Yahoo c Java who CTO of course, which is the greeting of the staff fellowship. Some listeners may recall me reading the entire text of the pamphlet by by Jimmy God odd about the staff fellowship called cosmic friends. And witches revealed that yahveh receita is the greeting given by the spice people to their confidence on Earth. Are you are you one of those confidence? JOHN?

Unknown Speaker  28:56
I did want to go into the FM Aryan society.

Unknown Speaker  29:00
Is that the same? Similar I think?

Unknown Speaker  29:06
And they told me that we've gotten a lot of work to prepare in the next thousand years.

Frank Key  29:13
Well, we're we'd better get cracking on it then. So I better go. Very many thanks to john for his interjections. And to pansy cradle drew who was knitting when she wasn't speaking. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
