Good evening This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. The usual stuff this week, about 30 minutes of prose, painfully wrenched from the very depths of my soul and or tapped out on a keyboard while drinking copious amounts of tea and staring out the window. Anyway, let's get on with it. Dobson wrote extensively during the period when he was hunkered down in a janitorial. The key pamphlets from this time were collected in a compendium and published as a thick paperback with a garish cover design suitable for sale at airport bookstores. It's sorted to be the only instance where Dobson's name was embossed in gold. Alas, this failed to impress the reading public and very few copies of the book was sold. Although we should bear in mind that I write over time before mass commercial airplane travel, so there were fewer airports and even fewer airport bookstores, and only a handful of customers frequenting those that did exist. One early one early airport bookstore worthy of note was that opened at 10 Tower been rustic airfield by marigold choose cousin basil true. Basil was a pegleg pear shaped man with tremendous Ruritanian mustachios, a federal headed entrepreneur whose every business scheme failed. He simply had no grasp of reality, his view of the world being at once mistaken, hallucinatory and plain wrong. If one were unkind, one would call him a blockhead. But he had come and winning ways and when he 12 those fine mustachios people swooned with the sortiment. Fast, he was able to convince a few foolhardy finances to back his airport bookstore, were under the delusion that airplanes flew at the speed of a peasant trudging along a muddy country lane, and that passengers would need extremely fat books to keep them occupied. He stocked only mighty tomes of great and forbidding length. Proust, Allah rush to Tom paradou Robert Burton's the anatomy of melancholy, Boswell's the life of Samuel Johnson, LL D. comprehending an account of his studies and numerous works in chronological order, a series of his epistolary correspondence and conversations with many eminent persons, and various original pieces of his composition never before published the whole exhibiting a view of literature and literary men in Great Britain for near half a century, during which he flourished. And Henry dargahs the story of the Vivian girls in what is known as the realms of the Unreal of the Glen dico, Angel linnaean war storm caused by the child slave rebellion, were in fact the only books available at basil choose bookstore until under pressure from his cousin, he agreed to carry the gold embossed Dobson Compendium. During the six months the business lasted, he did not sell a single book and was kept afloat only by his sideline in toffee, apples, inflight pastry novelties, and mustachio wax. a compelling reason for the lack of success of Dobson's big fat book is not so much it's preposterous length, but Curiously, he did not include an account of the most interesting thing that happened during the janitorial period. This was the series of events that have elsewhere been described as Dobson and the disquieting floppy noises from behind the panel. The title given to a ravishing essay by ravishing essayist mod glubb. A close reading of like globs text reveals many fascinating details, but it's far from complete. Most annoyingly, we have no idea of what the panel from behind which Dobson heard disquieting floppy noises was made. Was it teak or tin or mahogany or LED or hardboard or deal or zinc or beaten gold or corrugated cardboard or iron or Pappy and mash re or bauxite or impacted goat hair or plastic or both? have wood or Formica, or stitched together pelts from slaughtered wolves or bronze or marble or dough or gases suspended in a solid state. blob does not tell us.

What we do know is that sprawled upon the floor one Tuesday morning in April, the pamphleteer was disquieted by floppy noises, the source of which he soon traced to behind the panel, whatever the panel was, and whatever function it played within the sanatorium. We know too that as a result of his described, he rummaged in a drawer for a kizil with which to prise apart the panel from whatever it was fixed to, in order to ascertain the nature of the sloppy noises and to staunch them. We know that he failed to find a chisel nor any chisel like tool with which to accomplish the task. That nothing in the nature of a chisel was to be found in the drawer within a janitorial is perplexing, and it is a point to which ravishing essayist, more glob returns later in her ravishing essay. We know that Dodson leaned against the wall and let one of his accurate Paraguayans cigarettes and puffed upon it as he bent an attentive ear to the continued floppy noises. And we know that anon, the floppy noises petered out, and that Dobson stamped out the butt of his Paraguayan cigarette with his boot, and that he clamped out of the janitorial into the April morning and took a turn around a nearby pond. We do not know what the weather was like. And we do not know whether the pond was populated by ducks or geese or swans, or indeed if it was home to a grampus or a krakken. Unlikely as the last two may be, remember that the pond in the grounds of the janitorial was no ordinary pond. As you will know if you have read Dobson's pamphlet, some arresting, diverting, and frankly sensational factoids regarding certain ponds, I have had the pleasure to take a turn around in weather's arranged in alphabetical order by pond name. Some have pointed to the pamphleteers use of factoid rather than fact, to cast doubt on the veracity of this pamphlet, but it should be borne in mind that it was written at a time when Dobson was beset by benign seizures in his cranial integuments and he was not his usual self.

The next time Dobson was disquieted by plopping noises from behind the panel was a fortnight later. It was now May, the month in which the Dutch observe the resemble the remembrance of the dead and the Norwegians celebrate their constitution. Being neither Dutch nor Norwegian, the pamphleteer had no reason to mark these events, yet he did so loudly with bellowing and strangulated cries, tears streaming down his face and picnics. He was that kind of man sometimes. It was on another day in May, however, when shifting his writing desk from one side of the janitorial to the other, he again heard the disquieting floppy noises from behind the panel. He had not forgotten his fruitless search for a chisel in the drawer, and was not so foolish as to repeat it. Instead, he shoved his writing desk aside, leaving it halfway across the sanatorium tiptoed up to the panel and pressed one of his ears against it. For some reason, lag glubb insists on telling us it was his right ear. She can be given to such unnecessary detail presented without a shred of evidence, and yet remained silent on matters of greater input, which makes her sad as infuriating as it is ravishing. Be that as it may note that on this second occasion, Dobson's attention to the disquieting floppy noises from behind the panel was much more focused. In April, after failing to find a chisel. He had leaned insouciantly against one of the walls smoking while he listened, whereas in may look, he's crouching, the side of his head flattened against the panel and his garb is innocent of a fag. maddeningly, we do not know how long he remained in this creaky posture. Perhaps he was there all day growing increasingly disquieted. What is beyond doubt is that the very next day he wrote a note in his journal, his tone is tatry and bespeaks grumble meant rather than disquiet. And it's clear that the floppy noises are getting to him as they say. Soon enough, however, the subject is dropped, and the following 16 pages of the journal are filled with a draft version of a pamphlet upon composite patterns soap bars He was later to abandon together with a few notes on gale force winds, heady Lamarr, and that dolphin torn that gong tormented see. Shortly after completing that journal entry, Dobson took an evening stroll. We do not know what phase the moon was in, and being quite staggeringly ignorant of celestial orbs. Norden Dobson. We do not know the precise route he took once he left the grounds of the sanatorium, although it's likely that he would have passed the canal lock, and the tobacconist and the Badger sanctuary and the recently demolished community hub. Had he been eating cream crackers, there would have been a trail of crumbs for a sleuth to follow. For the pamphleteer was a messy eater at the best of times, and especially so when in motion. We know, however, that he had sworn off crackers of all kinds at this time, mistakenly believing them to be the cause of the benign seizures in his cranium integuments. This is a fix of his had caused a monstrous and prolonged argument with Dr. Ray Milland, and it was to be many years before their relations were mended. It is significant that Dobson never felt able to discuss his disquiet at the plopping noises from behind the panel with his physician for Dr. Ray Milland, was a man with much medical experience of unaccountable noises, floppy and otherwise, and he may well have been able to recommend a cause of action, probably involving muffling, and cushions. All we know for certain is that upon returning to the sanatorium in darkness, Dobson poked his head around the door for a midnight check and heard again the disquieting floppy noises from behind the panel. It is unclear what made him snap, but he made a sudden dash across the room and gave the panel a resounding kick with his boot. We do notice he cried out as he did so, but afterwards, in the darkness that was silence. The pamphleteer lit one of his accurate Paraguayan cigarettes and waited. his toes throbbed for his boot was old and fluffier than it had once been. He waited in the darkness in the sanatorium in the silence, flicking the ash from his cigarettes onto the fengshui monkey puzzle carpeting system until dawn broke.

mod gloves ravishing scholarly operators collapses at this point in her essay, and the next thing we know is September, the month in which the Zulu commemorate King Shaka, after whom Of course, best selling paperback author pebble head was named. Had pebble had been writing at the time basil Chu opened his ill fated airport bookstore, the peg legged and pear shaped entrepreneur would no doubt have thrown out his Proust's and burdens and Boswell's and daggers and stock two shelves with the countless fat glossy potboilers turned out by that most indefatigable of authors. Apparently, at every minute of every day, somewhere in the world, someone is reading a pebble head paperback. glob is a very different kind of writer. And while we suspect that pebble head would never let his operators collapse, and we would never forgive him if it did, it's the kind of thing we expect from the ravishing essayist and we do not let it trouble us. So when we skip from the scene of Dobson on a night in May, having successfully silenced the disquieting plopping noises from behind the panel with a flying kick off his boot to a torrential downpour in October, and the pamphleteer slumped, scowling in a bus shelter smoking a mentholated Bolivians. bogey, we simply press on a gogue. We soon learned that little had changed except the weather and Dobson's preferred brand of cigarettes. He was waiting for a bus in the rain because he'd been summoned to an appointment with the official in charge of the janitorial and of several other outlying facilities. This official a preening autocrat of many hats had been inundated with letters from the pamphleteer begging to be transferred from the janitorial on account of the disquieting plopping noises from behind the panel. After that night in May, the noises had returned insistently, and no amount of kicking the panel made them cease, as Dobson discovered his cost. He had even gone to the expense of a brand new pair of sturdy boots with toughened kept the better to kick the panel but to no avail. So began his written please to the official. Dobson knew that among the outlying facilities attached to the janitorial was a cow buyer, and it was to this dilapidated rustic hidey hole that he hoped to be sent. He did not confess in his many missives, that he was unpracticed in the niceties of cow care, and this may have been his undoing. As it was, the printing autocrat ignored all of Dobson's letters, until they began to arrive at a rate of two or three per shift. The disquieting plopping noises from behind the panel was steadily driving the pamphleteer crackers, and the tone of his letters was growing ever more hysterical. As more glob observes, it would be instructive if we could compare the unrestrained prose of these desperate pleadings with the overwrought and majestic style of the middle period pamphlets, but to date, no Dobson is of any standing has taken on such a task. They would of course be difficulties with the handwriting for when Dobson's brain was fuming is already crabbed and blotted scrawl became almost illegible. He is not alone among the greats in challenging the eyesight of those wishing to decipher his manuscripts. According to Jerome B. Levy, in disputed handwriting, an exhaustive, valuable and comprehensive workup on one of the most important subjects of today. 1909 Charlotte Bronte's writing seem to have been traced with a camera ik needle, and factories writing, while marvelously neat and precise, were so small that the best of eyes were needed to read it. Likewise, the writing of Captain Mariette was so microscopic that when he was interrupted in his labors, he was obliged to mark replace where he left off by sticking a pin in the paper. Napoleon's was worse than illegible, and it is said that his letters from Germany to the Empress Josephine, were first thought to be rough maps. Byron's handwriting was nothing more than a scroll. The writing of Dickens was minute, and he had a habit of writing with blue ink on blue paper.

We must assume that at some point in the first week of October, the premier autocrats smacked his forehead in despair at the tottering pile of letters arriving from the janitorial, for he took the unusual step of summoning the complainant, his headquarters, Fang castle, was situated high on a crag around which bats guittard and swooped the bus from which the pamphleteer alighted in the teeming rain stopped at the foot of the crag. And Dodson had many many steps to climb before he would reach the entrance to the castle. He was less than halfway up when his ill advised pink and yellow and polka dot Kennebunkport cap attracted the attention of several bats and the passing crow startled the pamphleteer lost his footing sprained his ankle and plunged into a clump of buttercups. He lay there helpless for three days hidden from the bus route by a row of lupins and hollyhocks, Fang castle looming above him high on the crag. We know that Dobson was dismissed from the janitorial before the end of October, for there is a journal entry clearly written on Halloween, where he refers to his relief, it's no longer having to suffer the disquieting floppy noises from behind the panel. What we do not know is whether he was writing from the cow buyer. In a particularly ravishing passage in her ravishing sa mod glob drops hints that she has identified the precise location where Dobson was hunkered down on that Halloween, going so far as to claim that she may even have it pinpointed on a map, but she does not say if he's talking about the cow buyer, or somewhere else entirely. Nor do we know what Dobson did at the end of his three days in the buttercups. When the sprain in his ankle ceased. Did he clamber up those many, many steps and confront the preening autocrat in Fang castle audit he shuffled to the bus stop and return to the janitorial. meteorological records indicate that it was still raining heavily. So the pamphleteer would have been sodden through. Indeed, he may have been so soaked that he would have been forbidden to board the bus for fear that any puddles he created may have dribbled into the under floor electrical wiring and caused the bus to explode or crash research Other than mod glubb have pored over the records of bass mishaps for the relevant period. And there is a tantalizing clue. In a report in the St. bibley. Babe David parish newsletter and fold out raffle ticket, which alludes to an exploding bus crashing their fan castle due to an underflow under-floor electrical wiring fold during a torrential downpour. But the newsletter was only published twice a year, and the data on this copy is unreadable due to smudging. In this morass of Rumsfeld, the unknown unknowns, it's an unexpected delight to chance upon solid incontrovertibly fact. Here reproduced without comment is a passage from Digby hoists memoir out and about with pebble head. That leap year on the 29th of February, I joined the best selling paperback just on a hike. We roamed a hill and dale with a mile upon mile snacking on berries and weeds and drinking milk we eat from unattended cows in the fields. It should not have surprised me that pebble head had an enviable milking technique when presented with an other. He is after all, a man of parts. We investigated knots of furs and svec and certain unnatural topiary sites as catalogued by drain and Huffington. I demonstrated to pebble head a method of vaulting across rivers using a stick and a paper clip. And he showed me how to view or a badger from its set with blandishments. Oh, how we traveled in a rye manly way as we promised across the loam. Scouting clouds overhead threatened drizzle. So in mid afternoon we took refuge in a ruin. As we crouched on what looked to me like the ragged remains of a fengshui monkey puzzle carpeting system, one so unaccountably popular. I noticed that pebble head grew quiet, his mustache moustache bristled and his his emitted wispy fumes. When I made to speak he hacked me by wedging a shard of slate in my mouth and bashing the side of my head with his fist. The drizzle turned into a violent shower that lasted less than a minute, and then the sun glaze down on us again.

I was all for leaving the ruin and continuing with our hike, for I was keen to show pebble had a pig enclosure I knew to be nearby, where the pigs were fantastic. But something in his demeanor gave me pause. He seemed strangely disquieted. Eventually, he began to speak in a voice that was not his own. Instead of that familiar high pitched really squawk like a drugged up corncrake his words boomed out, deepened, deafening, I spat out the shard of slate and shoved my hands over my ears. But still, that voice penetrated my soul, as if I were in the presence of some ancient terrible God. Behold, the realm of God said to the pebble head who was not pebble head. It is ruined now. But once not so long ago, it was the place where dwelt my fiend. That spot where you crouch, puny specimen of humankind was my panel, and behind my panel, my themes paid obedience to me, to the imperfect is of you earthly pipsqueaks. The horrifying and insane and magnificent and Berserk ritual jabbering of my themed sounded as but floppy noises which cause disquiet, rather than paralyzing terror. One day, my theme shall return and all shall be swept away, it shall be swept away and gone. The Voice ceased somewhere or linate tweeted. The wispy fumes from pebble heads is dispersed and his mustache stopped bristling. He looked at me as if nothing had happened and piped up. The rain has stopped. Digby, let us go and take a cold hard look at those fantastic pigs you were telling me about.

And related to that, as a writer of best selling paperbacks pebble head tends not to attract serious critical attention. Too often his work so this misters pap for Airheads, and while this is arguably the case with such works as pap for Airheads, swaps of triviality sloshing about between the ears and his thriller, The glazed stare of the brain dead Mop Bucket zombie. It's an encouraging sign that one or two scholars are addressing the pebble head of with perspicuity and panache. Well one rather than one or two. I refer to Sydney allergies recent article in the literary journal bookish guru, in which he examines the influence of plopping noises in pebble heads as yet unpublished blockbuster dustbin of pomposity, using critical techniques developed by men with terrific beards. allege argues that we cannot begin to understand the book without first being locked up in a dank cellar in which beetles scurry across the mildewed floor, and mysterious floppy noises can be heard possibly coming from behind a panel hidden in the gloom. There are those who poo poo alleges close reasoning and breathtaking critical acuity as the ravings of an idiot. There are those who accuse him of having a decidedly oddly shaped head and the wrong sort of beard. There are those who having engaged him in conversation at glamorous cocktail parties in swish urban rooftop gardens dismiss him as a babbling freak with issues. There are those who wish he'd been strangled at birth and disposed of in a pond. There are those who wish you'd never been born at all. There are those who Grant unintelligibly at the mention of his name. There are those who pick holes in the sleeves of their jumpers before shoveling the contents of a jar of pickled sausages down there, gullets. But I'm proud to be among those who rightly see Sydney college as a harbinger. I'm not yet entirely clear what he Harbinger's but by all that's holy in heaven and on earth. I shall stand here and repeat what I've just said over and over again, until not only am I blue in the face, but everything around me that has a face the hens, the cows, the cattle worries, the ducks, the other ducks, they to all turn blue in the face, or blue like the mightiest of skies over pointy town on a blazing moon when the earth stops spinning.

That's all for this week. Save for for the quote of the week, which sorry, which this week comes from Nikola Tesla from his autobiography, the strange life of Nikola Tesla. On my return to the city that night, I felt a positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. It was alight as though a small Sun was located in it and I passed the whole night applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally, the flashes diminished in frequency and force, but it took more than three weeks before they wholly subsided. These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, but they're no longer exciting. Bye bye.
