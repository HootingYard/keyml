This is indeed hooting yard. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to talk to you or read to you for half an hour or so as I normally do. Please note that the distance between the aerodrome and the zoo is very great. It's recommended that you wear a pair of stout hiking boots when disembarking from the airplane, beware of propellers. Try to remain on ruffled when presenting your bags for inspection at the customs shed. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Oops, I forgot to mention that before landing, be sure to pluck the hairs from your chinny chin chin. The regime has grave suspicions about men with beards, and not with reason the king has spoken and that is enough. There are 24 points of interest between the aerodrome and the zoo. And I wish I could say that they were arranged alphabetically from B to y. In a letter in a better ordered kingdom, they would be my last the designation of the points of interest fell to a ministry stuffed with illiterates, rough brutes for the most part, but those who had found favor with the king through mighty feet of arms. That's why there is a martial aspect to over half the points of interest, meaning that they may not be everybody's cup of tea. There will however be enforced stops on route. at each point of interest along the way, you will find a kiosk where refreshments may be obtained. Be warned that prices are subject to galloping inflation. So anything I told you now will almost certainly be out of date. By the time you embark upon the holiday of a lifetime. It is sadly impossible to get from the aerodrome to the zoo, without having to make a crossing of the harsh and inhospitable Glinka. Everything you've heard about the Glinka is true. You'll need some kind of protective clothing against the wind. There are creatures in the wind, you will hear the sound of mandolins and you will want to cling to your darling for wild is the wind. If your darling is not accompanying you, More's the pity. You will need a pre stamped ticket to enter the zoo. If you're not torn apart by wolves before you get there. The centuries are chosen for the acuity of vision and can spot a counterfeit ticket at 50 paces. So do not even think of trying to bluff your way through the magnificent iron gates with a forgery. To labor the point you will see heads on spikes, their eyes pecked out by birds all around the perimeter. No holiday would be complete without a sprint around the perimeter of the zoo. Incidentally, you may wish to replace your stout hiking boots with a pair of plimsolls the king's marshals will be on hand to Harry you and Hector you with their pointy Lance's and their guttural shrieks. The King's cartographers are working hard on an approved route back from the zoo to the aerodrome. Thus far they have not come up with any officially sanctioned tanneries. So there are several holding camps with rudimentary Earth SATs Canvas tents, and barbed wire in place next to the bog on the far side of the zoo.

During that little intermission after I finished the first piece, and then you heard the Caucasian alibi, here in the studio, we've been discussing dreams. And personally actually, because I've got a little lullaby which you can sing to your tinies if you have any tinies to send them to sleep. I wrote them This about an hour ago, actually. And it goes like this row row, row your boat Gently down the stream. When you're sucked into the Maelstrom, no one will hear you scream. Anyway, that was that I only mentioned that because suddenly we kept talking about dreams. And of course, you know, that's what lullabies are about. I have been reading sunup to midnight by Oswald Blaisdon, published in 1958, a record of Oswald Blake's and travels in Finland. So I know a lot about Finland 50 years ago. Anyway, his two quotations from it. The first one features Tove Jansson thing that's how you pronounce her name, the artist and writer who of course, invented the moon in trolls, and is apparently the most successful Finnish author ever. Anyway. Oswald Blake's done and his friend max met Tove Jansson Max said, Don't you ever feel inspired to paint the finished countryside in summer? It's also damned green, she answered. Then she told us about the squirrel, the one squirrel which has appeared on the island, and it slept under her neck and tried to collect food there. As the relationship between artists and squirrel developed, the squirrel came to expect a game at four o'clock in the morning. Tove Jansson had to get out of bed and pretend to be a tree, the squirrel would run up and down her frozen limbs. Interesting little insight there into the life of the author of the moon in trolls pretending to be a tree at four o'clock in the morning. Also. Here's an insight into the kind of entertainments available at finish fairgrounds in the 50s. Luna Park, the Lynn and Mackie in Helsinki, is high above the city on a granite outcrop with a water tower that looks like a stone gasometer with trees growing on top and which is circled with lights. One sideshow to judge by the pictures outside was a house in which people are attacked by bees.

Remarkably, it's seven years ago, that hooting Yaga listeners first learned of the exciting radio serial pie shop Deep Space six. My informants tell me that it's still at the development stage, beset by teething problems, but here's the original announcement. hurtling at inhuman speed through the universe, the thoroughly exciting spaceship double pneumonia was headed for a galaxy so distant that it could take billions upon billions of generations of a leaf cutter and to reach it. In command on the bridge was star Captain Barbara Bell get is accompanied by first officer Mr. unstrap Nord Taub, who was only half human. No one had ever worked out what weird extraterrestrial life form had spawned his other half and it was best not to ask for their in lay madness. And a certain Madcap frenzy is what you can expect in the new science fiction drama pie shop Deep Space six, currently being developed by a crack team headed by Mrs. gubbins who has returned to hemoglobin towers. The elderly Crone has put down her knitting and fueled by lots of piping hot cups of tea is conjuring up some thrilling ideas for this new radio cereal. In Episode One, for example, hostile plasma tronic aliens launch an attack on space station epsilon over x 977. Cutting off pastries applies to the pie shop. Mr. unstrapping Old Town, outwits them using a supersonic brain zapping process involving lots of sparks. whooshing noises Mrs. gubbins has asked sir Harrison Birtwistle to compose the theme music.

First off, of course, next month, on Friday the 18th of November, there'll be an evening of lopsided pros and lagoo breus music.

I think, Be there or be not in Bermondsey square. And did you know that there are so many episodes of hooting out on the air available as podcasts to be downloaded? hundreds of hours worth that if you put them on continuous play, and listen to them back to back, refraining from all food and drink, you would die before you got to the end? That's a sobering thought, is it not? On the other hand, if as you listened you sustained body and soul by snacking on filberts and tapwater. You would survive the experience. I'd be ready to download the next episode when it goes online. There's a podcast we've just got online in the last 24 hours.

Oh, and in other news, Today marks the 60th anniversary of the publication of weep punches for thou art become a naughty a dirge of excruciating length by Mavis do speak. It's a curious work based on the conceit that conscious pilot was reincarnated as Enid Blyton's little wooden boy. For the power test However, this appears to have been more than a mere conceit. She apparently believed it to be true. Having been vouchsafed Division during a session of faffing about with tarot cards, magic crystals, Sparrow Oracle's runes, spells, Dippy sticks, and similar mumbo jumbo vouchsafed, by the way, is the sort of word that crops up with distressing frequency in the dirge. Miss it Newspeak seems not to have considered what became of conscious pilot Ecto plasmic spirit essence between the governor of good deers death circa 37 ad and Noddy's first appearance almost 2000 years later in 1949 ad, nor did she ever address the inconvenient fact that the wooden boy is a fictional character. challenged on such matters in radio interviews, her usual tactic was to flail her arms in a melodramatic gesture, thus deliberately knocking over her complimentary cup of tea, spilling the boiling hot beverage into the Tweedy lap of her interviewer. After the subsequent kerfuffle, she would babble about the tea leaves now visible at the bottom of the cup, explaining how their disposition revealed other mystic insights which might become the subject of another dirge of excruciating length. Although so far as is known, she never published anything else. interpretations of the Dodge has varied, that trendy with its churchmen of the 1950s canon knobby fab gear, described it as a work of deep Christian morality, arguing that to be reborn as a fictional wooden being was a just fight for an imperfect, ethically compromised, all too human Judean governor of the first century. He expanded this view in a series of articles in the color supplements at a time when such articles used to appear in the color supplement. Several more conservative clergy took a different view, excoriating Mavis gu speak for cheapening the Gospels, and indulging in pagan practices with tarot cards, magic crystals, Sparrow Oracle's runes, spells, defeat sticks and similar mumbo jumbo. She was accused of the ritual slaughter of goats and hens, and of being in league with the great god Pan, who, in some contemporary color supplement cartoons bore a distinct resemblance to Canon nabih fab gear. In the teeth of all this controversy, that dirge itself was a little read, not least because it's virtually unreadable. Yet it gained a new lease of life later in the decade when it was taken up with great enthusiasm by the beatniks. goateed hepcat in black Polo neck jumpers took to reciting the dirt happenings. And there is an amusing account of Mavis gu speaks attendance at one such event. It really Fried my wig. daddio wrote the beatnik entrepreneur Herman homeruns in his memoir, when that crazy old Biddy turned up at the espresso bar for a reading of weep punches for thou art become naughty. She kept demanding to be given a pot of tea and a cup and saucer, and hey, we had to explain. It was like an espresso bar you dig? There was this cool cat with her dressed up like a priest, except he looked like the great god Pan. Mavis got so mad she flailed her arms and a melodramatic gesture, and spilled a cup of espresso in my lap. Some reports have Bernard 11 also present that night, incognito, though he always denied it. weep punches

for thou art become Nadi has long been out of print, but maybe it's due speak remarkably is still with us, sharp as a button, living in a nursing home at a dilapidated seaside resort. Every afternoon, she takes out the tarot cards, magic crystals, Sparrow Oracle's runes, spells, Dippy sticks and similar mumbo jumbo and summons ethereal insights. It is thought she's trying to work out what became of the ectoplasmic spirit essence of conscious pilot after Noddies final appearance in 1963 ad and Enid Blyton's death in 1968 ad, her latest theory intriguingly again has a connection to Bernard loving for Mavis Goosby is groping through the mystical mists towards the conviction that Pontius pilot stroke Nadi is now inhabiting the body of Bernard levy One time in amaranta Arianna Huffington?

This isn't really the time of year to go camping is it? October, you probably would have if you were gonna go camping, you'd probably have Gone Camping a few months ago. However, unseasonable as it may be, I think it might be useful to redo an extract from how to camp out a book published in 1877 by john m Gould, how to camp out. For convenience, The following list is inserted here. It is condensed from a number of notes made for trips of all sorts except boating and horseback riding. It is by no means exhaustive.

so remember if you do go camping do not overload yourself although that is an essential list of the things you need. Don't forget the songbook. Finally this week very quickly, here's a quotation another quotation This one is from a book published the year before that properties and powers in everyday matters by a Corey, published in 1976. And this tells you everything you need to know about galvanism. Man galvani observed convulsions in a dead frog, which laid near an electrical machine which was in action. Although there is a diversity of information as to whether it was she or a student who noticed the incident first, as she is said to have been an invalid and the frogs were for her benefit. It is more than likely she had an eye on them, and it would not be strange if they both saw the convulsions at the same time. However, the subject was investigated by Dr. galvani, who was a professor of anatomy, and they found that a knife touched the frog, and that when a metallic substance in contact with a nerve of the creature was brought within the action of the electrical machine there followed a twitching of the limb. And since that time, a great many discoveries have been made about always, and a machine constructed called the galvanic battery. The principle of it being that when two metals are connected by some substance capable of exciting they're different electricity. similar effects to these described maybe observed charges from the battery will occasion contortions and violent jerking is in dead corpses, which are rather horrible to witness after the skin has been removed from the hind legs of frogs and some salt sprinkled over them. While they have rule of course, the legs will quiver and jerk in a curious manner occasioned by the action of the salt upon them, it is likely that Madame galvani was going to have the frogs for her dinner, and I have a taste between fish and chicken, you brought them over the fire, and then put a little sprinkle of salt and the least dust of pepper, if any at all, then you'll have delicious morsels. It's not necessary to cook them all out of doors. Building fires is a dangerous employment for children. And if you ever have any, bring them into the kitchen and do the cooking there where you can get help if you should need it. A word more about that pepper, pepper, spice and other irritants should be used with caution, if used at all, for the effect of them is to excite the coating of the stomach and lead eventually to disease. In concluding about the battery alluded to, it's capable of producing great quantities of electricity, there's a positive pole and a negative pole, the positive pole attract a negative pole and a negative pole attract a positive pole. These terms positive and negative, expressed different quantities of the fluid positive being more and the negative less the term pole in this connection meaning point, point of concentration, exactly how the metals are arranged in a pile and the vessels with acid and water and so on are adjusted as explained in works on the subject. We've learned so much of the ways of electricity that we cannot be surprised as our predecessors were, even if dead bodies jerk and Thumper round
