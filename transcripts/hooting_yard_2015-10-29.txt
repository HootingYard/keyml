Just like Jason Bourne has an identity, a supremacy and an ultimatum. So Petula Clark has files, a project, both of which I told you about last week in the Petula Clark files and the Petula Clark project. And thirdly, she has a minefield. The Petula Clark minefield was the happy outcome of my determination with the Petula Clark project. To put to good use the materials in the Petula Clark files, which I had collected in the 1960s and kept for 50 years in a remote secure storage facility, guarded by wolves. The idea came to me when one wind sweat morning I was sashaying along a majestic and important Boulevard in my baby week. All of a sudden, my boon companion Walter mad, the animal behaviorist amateur electrician, and van owner, drove up alongside me in his van slowed to sashaying pace, wound down his window and shouted at me. I have inherited a field he cried, lighter over tea and toffee. I learned more. An elderly mad uncle had died and left his nephew in his last will and testament, a field somewhere out in the blasted an awful countryside. If it were a magnetic field, moaned Walter mad, I might be interested, but it's nothing more than a flat expanse of mud and muck out beyond the blister lane bypass past the viaduct, and the haha and the decoyed duck pond on the football pitch, and the giant cement statue of Nabil styled on the weird cloud of ectoplasm and the bridge over the river horrible, and the vinegar works and Pang Hill orphanage, and the clown hospital and the blasted Heath and the Bolshevik Ballet School of the forest of gargoyles, and the sump of slurry and the remote secure storage facility and the white, I cried. This field of yours is near the storage facility. Have you allowed me to finish I would have listed several more significant landmarks on the way but yes, it is fairly close by as the crow flies. I have an idea I cried, and I jumped into the van and told Walter mad to drive like the clappers. My idea was the Petula Clark mindfield. Through Walter manage inheritance, we had the field. The next step was to remove the Petula Clark files from the remote secure storage facility. And then to remove each of the six or seven press clippings from its bath cardboard folder. The folders, we tossed unsentimentally, onto a nearby bonfire. It was then a simple matter to have each of the six or seven press clippings laminated to protect them against the many and various calamities of awful countryside wherever. Once laminated each press clipping was attached to one end of a pointy stick passes to the non pointy end. This stage I had not decided whether the Petula Clark minefield would accommodate one customer at a time, armed with all six or seven pointy sticks, to which were attacked the laminated Petula Clark press clippings or six or seven customers simultaneously, each armed with a single pointy stick. Six or seven customers at a time was probably the better option, as it would allow us to advertise the pakula Clark minefield as a splendid opportunity for a wide range team building exercises for middle managers in small and medium sized companies.

Imagine the fun, as the six or seven customers are handed a pointy stick each to one end of which is affixed by twine or laminated press clippings about Petula Clark by must now make their way across the flat expanse of mud and muck prodding the ground at intervals in an attempt to locate the mines submerge just below the surface. If they successfully locate each of the six or seven mines with their pointy sticks, they win belief they inadvertently tread upon a mine, they lose. The minds themselves are not explosive instead, using a clever bit of electrical gubbins concocted by Walter mad using his amateur electrician skills. When a mine is detonated. It blasts forth a deafening volume, a recording of Petula Clark singing her Tip Top hit, written by Tony hack, and first released in 1964. Shortly before I began to compile the Petula Clark files, downtown. What an exciting day. That was when Walter mad and I first opened the Petula Clark minefield to paying customers. I felt a warm glow of content that I had long last put the Petula Clark files to good use by devising the Petula Clark project. And with the Petula Clark minefield, bringing it to fruition. The lesson I think, is that even when one of your activities seems utterly pointless, and believe me, there were times over the past half century, when I wondered why on earth I clung on to those six or seven particular clock press clippings, and kept them in a remote secure storage facility guarded by wolves. There is always a chance that you can take the pointless and make it pointy. That is what I did. And you can too, especially if you're boon companion inherits from a mad uncle, a flat expanse of mud and muck.

Dobson was very fond of his blotter whenever he wrote about it, which was more often considered normal for a grown man, his prose attains a picture of purple enthusiasm modern readers can find uncomfortable, not to say distressing. It has been said that the pamphleteer even had a pet name for his blotter as if it were an animal being like a puppy or a hamster. But nobody claims to know what it was citation needed, as they say on the Wikipedia. There has been some debate of crushing tedium as to whether Dobson's attachment was to the blotter itself, or to the sheets of blotting paper he inserted under it's for leatherette corner flaps. He made something of a ritual of this, changing his blotting paper every Thursday afternoon, at about four o'clock, just before he had a cup of tea and a plate of bloaters. He seems to have inserted a fresh sheet irrespective of the state of the one to be discarded. As often as not his blotting paper remained pristine, as he almost always wrote in pencil. They use cheats, he kept in a cardboard box shoved underneath the sink in an outbuilding. Each time he filled the box, he secreted it somewhere like a squirrel and went to Huberman department store to buy a new cardboard box to date nobody has ever discovered where he hid all those boxes of slightly used blotting paper. It is one of the enduring mysteries beloved of Dobson nests. The plotter itself was unexceptionable as blotters go, it was a flat leatherette rectangle with corner flats under which the four corners of a sheet of blotting paper with tucked several witnesses have noted that, contrary to what one might expect, the blotter was not always in place on the pamphlet is escrito Ah, sometimes he left leaning upright against the wainscot. At other times, he put it in a bag and carried around with him for no apparent purpose. It was not an unknown thing to eat his bloaters off it or to use it as a bird table. Dobson was fantastically ignorant of the diet of birds though, and would places blotter on top of an upright stick in the garden, and then scatter hard toffee marbles upon it. Such confectionery was avoided by any little birds or lighting on the blotter bird table, for rare is the bird which can digest hard toffee. They would also risk Breaking Bad little beaks on it, for Dobson's preferred toffee marbles, which we bought in paper bags from a peddler were the hardest known to humankind. And he gave them an extra bacon his oven for hours at a time to make them harder still. In a new as yet unpublished book, Pam clog and graft leverages tell the story of how Dobson's blotter was stolen and later recovered. melodramatically, the pamphleteer once described this as the worst week of my life. On a rambunctious Wednesday, when the Zodiac was in a meaningless alignment. The pamphleteer decided he needed to stiffen the back of his blotter to restore its rigidity. He filled a pile with starch and carefully lowered the blotter into it, and then he strode off full of vim to blister lay Mido for waterpolo practice. Dobson was a keen if in that player of that most thrilling of aquatic team sport, and he wrote a number of pamphlets about it, the best of which is probably a new and improved method of drying your Puck with a towel out of print. In standard Water Polo, of course, parks are not used, but the Ballista lane academicals was no ordinary waterpolo team.

Frank Key  12:28
Nor was this an ordinary practice on this fateful Wednesday, for the coach wanted the team to try out a new tactic, which involved distracting their opponents by imitating the calls of loons and shoveler ducks and grackles. By the time he returned home, Dobson was hoarse and exhausted. He went straight to the room in which he left his blotter steeped in a pile of starch, and was distraught to find it gone. The pile itself had been knocked over and the starch had soaked into the floorboards. Here is how in their book, Pam, clock and glove ages describe what happened next. Dobson cried out, Dobson solved. Dobson crashed about the house. Dobson called detective Captain kargh pan. Dobson told detective Captain card pan that his blotter had been stolen. Dobson sat in a chair and waited for detective Captain card pan to arrive. Dobson drank a tumbler milk from a goat. See Dobson set, see Dobson drink. This sort of thing becomes tiresome after a few dozen pages, but I admire the author's attention to detail. Apparently they won a medal for an earlier book about the Watergate hearings. What we learned in this new work is that the thief was a contemptible scoundrel with a pencil mustache, the look of the startled rabbit, a fixation upon blotters a cheap pair of gloves, a corrective boot, a skewed sense of morals, a week kin, a hacking cough, a sordid past, the width of a drainpipe, a collapsing lung, a dubious parentage, odd socks and other cravat. bats in his Belfry shares in the Bradford and Bingley building society, corks on his apples, plums in his pocket, catastrophic measles scars, renter is vinegar in his ears, and sausages on the brain. Detective Captain card ban tracked him down four days later, after the theft of Dobson's blotter hiding out in a house of miscreants hard by the banks of Lake foofy. Dobson's first words when one of detected Captain Kirk pan's henchmen returned the blotter to him at a rando in a rendezvous in a dismal canteen. Well, thank you so much for retrieving my Natty blotter studious Dobson list will recognize that phrase as the title of a dirge that pamphleteer composed for the second international Anthony Burgess festival of uncompromising dodges in olm, where it one 15th Prize.

And now, the adventures of the pointy head detectives. The pointy head detectives had very few adventures. much of their time was spent reclining upon demand code rotating and activity not conducive to venturesome antics. And were not code rotating by directed most of their energies towards the precise disposition of the demand within their so called deduction chamber, and ever pointed room offer remote corridor on an otherwise deserted story of the police headquarters annex on the far side of town. Sometimes, they determined that the demands were best placed in regular geometric formation at other times, but they were best scattered Higgledy Piggledy in the available space on Easter Sundays and other Christian festivals. The pointy head detectives experimented with divan arrangements, somewhere between orderly and chaotic. They had never been able to settled upon an optimum disposition. For they were only too aware that some crimes were best solved with the the vans lined up in a row or in a stellar pattern while other crimes were cracked. When the demands were arranged haphazardly. The one thing they all agreed upon was the effectiveness of their cerebral approach. As pointy head detectives reclining upon the vans, smoking their pipes, looking to the untrained eyes as if they were half asleep and lost in latitude. So when a Cubs Scribbler, from let's outwit brainy criminals magazine, was dispatched to police headquarters to interview the pointy head detectives and to write up their adventures for a feature article. He was rapidly plunged into despair. There were only so many ways of describing a pointy head detective reclining upon a divan, cogitating before repeating oneself. Even their discussions about the disposition of the demands were carried out quietly and thoughtfully and without rancor or fistfights. The Scribbler slumped in a corner of the deduction chamber and wept. He went unnoticed by the point he had detectives who were sprawled on their demand, cogitating about the latest enormity, they were set to solve the case of the poisoned well at poison well. The poor weeping Scribbler was terrified that unable to craft an exciting piece of prose from such an exciting material, he would be dismissed from his position in those parts at that time, it was the lot of dismissed scribblers to be sent to the frontier to dig drainage ditches. What could save him from such a fight? He had that one recourse, and that was to rely on the power of his imagination. The Scribbler hurried back to his Cubby, and wrote a wholly fictional account of the point he had detectives. fighter jets screamed across the sky as the point he had detectives teetered on the edge of the erupting volcano he scribbled boiling hot lava lapping up their stylish Winkle pickers. The Dowty fivesome did Dowty daring doings With much shouting and screaming and use relating, but always with a purpose. Evil wrongdoers trembled in their hideaways. As the pointy head detectives came crashing down from the volcano at inhuman speed with magnetic Ray guns. The wind howled and the sun back the earth with brilliance. as Captain ek clear off guard and the team commandeered a fantastically fast sports car and sped across the plains towards the scene of criminality. Not even the cataclysms of earthquake monsoon, and the coming to pass of ancient biblical prophecy could stop them. swatting aside the Locust swarms, the pointy head detective descended upon poison well, and nabbed the perp just as he tried to escape in his rocket ship. You're nicked cried to Lieutenant x pivac. eschewing the bureaucratically approved verbal rigmarole of less venturesome detectives through fla it's like the poison Well, well

poisoner caught red handed. It's a fair cop and no mistake. There was much more in this vein, and the editor of let's outwit brainy criminals was delighted sales of the magazine sword, and in both fashionable Cylons and sordid middens. All anybody could talk about was the brave charismatic pointy head detectives. There was gossip about a feature film and a television series. The cub Scribbler was commissioned to write further adventures, and he did not disappoint. Week after week, he recounted entirely fictional thrills and spills about the fivesome, careful to slip in just enough real world fact to give his yams an era of verisimilitude. The further reach such a pitch that eventually came to the attention of the Toria Slee dem chief of police. This big metal fellow built like a walrus with a mustache to match decided to pay a visit to his crack crime fighting team in their little appointed room, offer remote carried or on an otherwise deserted story of the police headquarters Alex on the far side of town. He was astonished on that rain last Thursday afternoon. To find the supposedly heroic point he had detectives reclining on the vans cogitating.

Frank Key  22:45
Where is the douchiness where the derring do he wailed his Captain clay off guard. We are in the middle of solving the despicable slaughter of the Innocents down by sawdust bridge. The chief of police flailed his arms to disperse the fog of pipe smoke, and shouted his head off. You ought to be down at sawdust bridge then armed to the teeth, sniffing out clues and ready to snap the cuffs on the perp after a spot of sickening violence. Preferably, at the very same time as a sea monster emerges dripping from the river and wreaks havoc in the vicinity as would happen in those popular magazine reports. He cried. So cerebral with a pointy head detectives so removed from the petty concerns of the workaday world, but they remained quite ignorant of their newfound fame. They had no idea what their Creek was talking about. furrowing their brows even deeper, they sank further into the plush upholstery of the vans, and cogitated more furiously. Now the chief of police, like many a dim walrus mustache official, in fact, and fiction was not given to considered reflection. He made snap decisions and blundered on regardless. So it was that he set a clacks on roaring hustle the point he had detectives out into the rain, set fire to the demands, and had the deduction trained by locked and bolted, placing scary has Chem signage outside it for good measure. Get the hands to sword us bridge he screamed and solved the crime in an exciting and blood curdling manner, or I'll have your guts for garters perplexed and befuddled, the five some crunched away. As soon as they were out of sight of the truth. They lay down on a sopping wet lawn reignited their pipes and resumed their code rotations. They were still code rotating A few hours later, when the rain ceased and a shaft of brilliant sunlight broke through the clouds illuminating just behind them a terrible scene. The cubs Scribbler now grown rich and preening by dint of his success was strolling across the lawn, dressed to the nines in a top hat and a brand new silken boffo splendido Italianate suit, when he was set upon by a whirling tangle of ruffians, who beat him senseless with bludgeons and robbed him and stripped him of clothes and cash and kept him into the swollen roaring river and cackled evil cackles as they did so, and then went further marauding, attacking nearby orphans and puppies and glorying in their criminality. Code rotating upon the wet lawn, the pointy head detectives remained utterly oblivious to the enormity is taking place just yards away. The clouds dispersed and Thursday afternoon with sunny with a light breeze.

That's almost the end of this week's show. But we'll finish once again with a brief extract from the book that you have to buy in time for Christmas. In fact, you'd need to buy several copies for gift for your friends and family. Mr. Keyes, shorter, potted brief, brief lives available from all good book shops. And terrain this week show here is an entry under under the section on people whose names begin with J. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing this correctly, but it's Sam Sam quite gently a South African sign language interpreter 21st century ga was employed as the sign language interpreter, the memorial service for Nelson Mandela on the 10th of December 2013. Rather than using any recognizable signing system, however, Jay's interpretation of speeches by luminaries such as President Barack Obama and Jacob Zuma, consisted of random hand gestures, which translated as gibberish. apologizing after the event, January he explains that what happened that day, I see angels come to the stadium, I start realizing that the problem is here. Sometimes I react violent on that place. Sometimes I will see things that trace me I was in a very difficult position. And remember those people, the President and everyone Bobo armed, there was armed police around me. If I start panicking, I'll stop being a problem. I have to deal with this in a manner so that I mustn't embarrass my country. asked how often he had become violent in the past, he replied, a lot. And that's the end of this week show. I'll be back next week and I'll read you two more brief lives and some more pros. And yeah, bye bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:36
Life's like that, isn't it? me the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans of the Nerds who wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music
