Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. In last week's show, I read the first part of by aerostat to hooting yard, a very old story from the last century. And so I'd like to continue with part to wrap up the story today. The point where we left it on the writer has been charged by Dobson, who is a different Dobson to Dobson the outer print pamphleteer has been charged by Dobson with cracking down verbal and doing him to death. And he's now heard had news that burble is in hooting yard and is on his way there. So this is by aerostat to hooting yard, part two. I eventually traveled to hooting yard by hot air balloon or aerostat. I met the pilot if that is the word in the tavern. Her name was matzah Blomqvist and she agreed to carry me and my have a sack purely as ballast. In other words, we would be held over the side should occasion arise. This was of no concern to me as I had a parachute in my have a sack Ha. matzah was bound for the outskirts of Hoon, carrying a strangely assorted cargo, including a barometer and compass, flags, anchors coke jacket, a packet of pamphlet a bottle of brandy, some biscuits, apples to useless silk covered aerial or an equally useless rudder and a movie net are sort of hand operated revolving fan. We got up safely and I sat on back to read some of the pamphlets. I was startled to discover that Dobson had written one of them. It was a techy little tract entitled 92 uses and abuses of mustard. I barely got beyond the first few sentences. The prose was tough but doltish paring over the rim of the basket, I saw the sort of scene one sees from the basket of a balloon. We had been in the air for perhaps quarter of an hour when we were buffeted by an unearthly flock of spiny winged things. I'm afraid that I scraped with fried bots or blonde Blomqvist showed rather more presence of mind lashing the malevolent beast with a gleaming Cutlass, but it was too late. The airbag had already been punctured, and we began immediately to lose altitude. mops carried out a number of exciting technical adjustments involving the goals, valves and flaps of the aerostat Meanwhile, I searched desperately in my hammer sack for the parachute, descent quickened. We are plummeting towards the ground very fast shouted matzah. Hold on to your hat. I am not wearing a hat, I replied, quaking with Tara. Here, she cried, tossing me a worm eaten Beretta. I thrashed it on my skull in the nick of time. We crashed the earth with much bumping thumping and a series of splats. Miraculously, I was unharmed, mops I herself suffered only a lesion on her brow. Although the spokes on her wheelchair were terribly mangled. we dragged ourselves clear of the silken wicker wreckage, and fetched up in a ditch moxa had managed to salvage the biscuits and the useless rudder. I expelled a mouthful of mud and reached into my hammer sack for various bits and pieces of navigational equipment, including an extensively detailed map. Look gasp motza actually dallied with a biscuit. There are the gates of hooting yard. What an old throw coat dryer was so busy rooting around in my head the fact that I did not use my eyes. moxa was right. I followed her pointing finger until a tremendous British portal ornamented with lacing carvings of quick lon Bill Murray and blunt. I had reached my destination. somewhere behind those gates looked burble, and I was coming for him.

mops his wheelchair was soon knocked back into shape, and she rattled off towards the outskirts of Hoon, before she left. And despite my protestations, she insisted that I take half of her biscuits. As soon as her back was turned, I ground them into the muck beneath my boot. I could not bear the distractions of shortbread, my mush bags would suffice. I traced burble easily and carried out Dobson's instructions without a hitch. The flooded mine shaft was on a patch of waste ground four or five miles from hooting yard. Somewhat gratuitously I wipe the blood off my hands with burbles own cravat. It had been embroidered by hand, is sweethearts depicting in intricate detail a selection of uproarious scenes from the Old Testament. For a moment I considered keeping it as a souvenir pack was a thought. I tossed it down the mineshaft at the bottom of which, like the fresh corpse of burble. Taking a blowtorch out of my hammer sack, I incinerated the wheelbarrow in which I had traveled his body to this detestable spot. When all that remained, was a pile of ashes. I turned away and began the long plod back to hooting yard, the night air wreaked of Stalinism, I pulled my cardigan tighter around my body and lit up one of Perkins q roots. As I plotted, I rehearsed in my head, the opening lines of the report I would write for Dobson your instructions arrived at midnight, I was dog tired, having spent the evening slaughtering a colony of flies. Nevertheless, I took immediate steps. My first thought was to select the weapon. You specified a duck, and I hoped I would not be straying too far from your intentions by using other lead on mag. I went up to the attic to fetch it. There was no battery in my torch, and I clambered. Such drivel would Dobson be interested in all this detail, but he'd asked for a full report and he was going to get one. And I clambered over the huge iron crate which was stacked in my loft. I could hardly see a thing eventually identified the correct crate and blasted it open. Inside underneath a pile of anti matter. I found the mag is last be news to pound some ragwort into oblivion, and minute Craters of the plant were embedded on the head. The maj would need a thorough cleaning, I descended. descending from the attic, I filled the bath dondre other factoring kit of protective clothing, and held a glorious array of chemical preparations into the piping hot water. I then plunged the mag into the bath. These are not unpleasant though holy fictional recollections were interrupted before I was even halfway back to hooting yard. A finger loom before me in the darkness. As I closed upon it, I saw that it was crumbling. Why crumble? I cried, you have the appearance of a maniac. You are disheveled and frosty and pale. Your teeth are clenched, and although the light is not good, I can see that your features are distorted by an awful Rictus. You are brandishing a dog. chronolock made no reply but lunged towards me aiming the duck at my throat. If I were to avoid a grizzly death, I would have to act fast. I stepped to one side swivel duct and shimmied in an alarming fashion designed to bewilder my assailant. At the same time. I used to have a sack for my shoulders, lifted it above my head and brought it crashing down on CRAN mop skull. He crumpled to the ground. Removing Dobson's medical dictionary from the have a sack I satisfied myself that crud mop was dead. I then made a thorough search of his countless pockets. It was almost dawn before I was finished emptying them, spreading their

contents out on the ground. And around his body among the Annecy balls, bleak corks, diuretics or got floor cloth gobstoppers hurricane lamps, ink jam, tail landing net, Morris tubes, nard, OT, polio vaccines, Quicksilver, rep, shares, fouls, ukulele strings, valves, watering xanthine, yogurt and Zoo water me diagrams, I found what I was looking for. I knew that chronolock was too stupid to destroys instructions from Dobson as I always did. There in the midst of the rubbish was a small piece of paper, torn none too carefully from a notebook on which Dobson had scrawls his orders. I spat into the Bracken and read them. track down scrim jaw. Why lie him and slit his throat with a dark, then bury him under a geologically improbable pile of rocks. I should expect your report as soon as possible. Dobson Perkins had hinted that Dobson's brain was now I puny and curdled thing, but still, I was crushed by this revelation. I slumped to the ground scrunching a piece of crud locked wrapped in my fist. tiny things with dozens of legs scurried around me, climbing onto my socks and into my boots. I left them to get on with it. The dawn blasted me out of my stupor. I could not remain sitting around in the open country next to a dead man, the contents of his pockets strewn around me. I would look for all the world like a common robber. My first thought was to throw crumb lock down the flooded mineshaft but as a couple of miles away from it now, and I could hardly drag his body that far. His girth was vast. I think that was why Dobson had hired him. In his essay Triton among the minnows Dobson expounded at length upon his loading of all it was microscopic, elfin, or we he only employed me because I'm almost seven feet tall. Although I had been shrinking recently. It is most perplexing, the more so because my usual fount of medical information, Dobson's dictionary has absolutely no light to shed on the condition. I had been planning to tax him with this perhaps in a little PostScript to my report. Well, now there would be no report. Haha, it was obvious obvious. Dobson would assume I was dead, and who resided gainsay him. snorting with glee, I hurriedly buried krumlov under a pile of rocks. The wasteland outside hooting yard, could hardly have been bettered for providing a geologically improbable mound, as demanded in the instructions. I heap great lumps and collages of stuff on top of krumlov. bauxite rubbed shoulders with flop chert with mal want with calcium. By the time I had finished, I was matted with filth. I gathered together CRAN locks, pitiful agglomeration of odds and ends including the dark and shoved the lot into my hammer sack. When I got back to hooting yard, it was hot it was lunchtime. I sat by the canal and devoured an enormous pot of boiling custard. One day, I will be able to go home. But first, I had to send Dobson a report chromebox report. I stole a barge and spent a couple of years more than an unspeakable fan. I assume the air of a baudry sprouting, decisive mustachios and wearing a brocade mantle of some antiquity. I sold off the barges cargo of rotting vegetable vegetable matter, and made myself at home. I had wanted to write a seafaring yarn, but this would have to do as I sat at my little escrow tois water rats gnawing at my boots, the stench of bilgewater, wafting around me. I listened to the clanking of dredgers, and the screeching of flocks of beasts with wings. I had never been so happy. I took out my pencil and wrote dear Dobson scrim drawer has been obliterated. He did not put up a struggle. I am sending the duck to you under separate cover. Farewell from lop.

So that was by Eero stat to hooting yard, written about 30 years ago 2530 years ago. And now I'm going to read something I wrote last week. You can decide for yourself whether my prose is improved, deteriorated or stayed pretty much the same. This is called man at CNA that's good consider the manner of CNA where C and A are points on a plane equidistant from central point B. We might ask reasonably, why c precedes a in this hypothetical space, when it is more usual, much more usual for a to proceed see. But quite frankly, this is the least of our worries. The more far more problematic is the idea that the manners See, sorry, far more problematic is the idea that the man is at sea and a simultaneously greater minds than mine have, over the centuries devised the natural laws by which everything in the known universe is bound. And I would not be exaggerating if I said that these laws simply will not tolerate a man being in two places at once. We can immediately dispose of the somewhat desperate solution that the man at point A is a doppelganger, one who appears identical in every respect to the original man at point C, but is not him. To show how facetious this idea is, we need only remark that we are dealing with Vermont CNA, not the men, and it is the plural men we would be speaking of. If we had the man at sea, and another man at a, no matter how uncannily the latter resemble the former, even down to the precise number of hairs on the head, or the disposition of pockmarked on the grizzly countenance. So we must be clear that when we speak of the manner CNA we speak of the same man absolutely identical in all particulars at both point C and point A, which, if you're paying attention, you will remember are equidistant from point A to point B by the way is occupied by either man or woman or beast of the field. We posited existence, the better to comprehend the space between C and A and also because in its absence, there would be no reason I can think of why we should not call point C point B. But as I say, there are greater minds than mine, and perhaps one of them could devise a compelling reason why B should be ejected from the hypothesis entirely. Until such reasoning is applied, however, we will continue to insert an unoccupied point B between and equidistant from the two points at C and A which as we have seen are occupied by the man. Gosh, this is fun. We might stumble towards a comprehensive explanation of the man being at sea and a if we introduce the element of time. Let us imagine we are wearing a cheap wristwatch and keeping one eye upon it. As we consider the man at CNA the whole damn thing makes sense. If we're able to say that the man is at sea at say 10:30am and at a at 2:30pm. We might want to ask how on earth it takes him four hours to make the simple journey from C to a passing through B to pick up a sausage roll for sustenance. But we can perhaps account for that by giving him a pair of crocs upon which he must have locked himself along, his legs being withered. Such infirmity would fit neatly with the grisly countenance above noted.

Frank Key  20:16
The obvious objection to this ostensively happy solution is that with us dealing not with the man at CNA, but with the man at sea, then a we must then regrettably remove the treat wristwatch and chuck it into a ditch and scratch our head in bewilderment. Think think, Aha. A thank grimace slowly resolves itself into the near certainty or solution can be found. If we imagine point C and point A are so close together, almost abutting one another, with only tiny little point B between them that the man is strangling them, one foot planted firmly at sea, and the other at a he is in Cuba, notably the manor CNA but on second thought, we must knock this proposition down violently. It has already been shown that the man's legs are withered and he must rely upon crutches. It is beyond the bounds of sense that such a cripple could stand sturdy and steady and upright and resolute, with either foot planted firmly anywhere at all. The best he could do would be to lock the base of one crotch in position at point C and the other at point A, and balance himself swinging between them. But it can be proved using geometry are one of the Allied disciplines. devised by better minds than my own, that he would of necessity be swinging in the air just above point B. The tiny point you recall, we have jammed between point C and point A for cogent reasons not to be gained said he is therefore the man at B or at best, the man at B whose crutches are plastered or planted in CMA. Even a half would I think would have to concede that such a fellow is a very different beast to a bona fide manner CNA increasingly befuddled we may have to return reluctantly to the less than satisfactory doppelganger theory, or even more reluctantly suspend the laws of physics. But wait, could it be that the answer is staring us in the face? Or rather glancing at us slantwise at an unexpected angle? Could it all be a bit of staged trickery, mustered up by a conjurer employing a mirror perhaps placed at point Bay? If we could identify and crushed variety set a magician of Grizzly countenance we would surely be home and dry and immediately one springs to mind who will ever forget the crippled crack bound? My stroke the amazing blink oh and his lovely assistant, Janet, surely is the amazing blink Oh, who with the aid of a mirror, are more likely mirrors plural is the man who appears to be at both C and a one on the same time. We can now go and take a nap having solved the conundrum. Alas or not this troubled by uneasy dreams. And we wake in a cold sweat that are an unanswerable question. clanging in our head. By what feet of leisure done there. Did the amazing blink Whoa, make his lovely assistant Janet swiftly and sudden softly and suddenly vanish away from C and A.

Frank Key  24:53
Well, I hope that's settled once and for all the whole query of how the man Could be at sea and A. and listeners will know that from time to time, I find inspiration from cryptic crosswords. For decades, it's been my daily habit to tackle the Guardian crossword. And I occasionally have a bash at the cryptic crossword in other newspapers. Anyway, a few days, a few days ago, I was particularly impressed by the clue for number four across in The Guardian crossword, which was as follows. incidents where get punches, current, sorry, incidents where get punches crusty things behind the back of cafe. I did solve that. But while it was fresh in my eye, I wrote it down before I'd solved it, what kept to keep it fresh in my mind, because I think that would make a very good subject for a hooting yard story. series of incidents where a gift punches crusty things behind the back of a cafe. So you can look forward to perhaps a number of or one story or a number of stories featuring a gift and bow on the back of a cafe. I think that's about all we've got time for this week. So that was by aerostat to hooting yard and man at CNA and a project for a future stories. I might have written one or two of them by the time I come back next week. Bye bye.
