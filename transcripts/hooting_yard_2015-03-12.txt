I hope you've got a note for that and you got the numbers, right. I read it as carefully as I could. You might be interested to know what you've just heard. We're, of course always bang up to date here at hooting yard. And so, in keeping with the Zeit Geist, what I just read to you was a partial list of wedding presents presented to Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips. On their wedding day, the 14th of November 1973. They received almost 1500 presents and those that I have read to you, it's just a small selection that came in from every corner of the land. Personally, I'd be quite interested to see those futuristic crayon pictures. And I do wonder, you know if when they divorced I can't remember when they divorced but when they divorced, whether they had to fight over the knitted coat hangers, or the book on understanding cystitis. Anyway, very enlightening. I think that's the the some of the wedding gifts given through Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips a lovely couple. I think you will agree.

Anyway, we move on with two other things. tokenism I called it when they gave bleakly grab his weekly coupons. Billiken grab was glad of them, very glad. But he did not understand why they called it tokenism. Was it not coupon ism. Once or twice they took him aside and tried to dig into his head the difference between a token and a coupon and there isn't. But big lab was dense, very dense, and could not twig. So they parked him on a couch in a corridor and had him brought a cup of tea from time to time while they arranged for somebody to come and take him away. that somebody was Poom Franks of the tea strainer Poom phrixus with his big Potato Head and Gary Alice nature Pontefract held no hostages to fortune nor saw the moat in his own eye. other modes other eyes Oh, certainly, it was one of the things he was known for far and wide. That's why they called on him. He was sentimentally appreciative of legally glads denseness he held him by the hand and let him out along the corridor and through the exit into the bounteous field. ballygally glad was naturally concerned about his coupons. Keep them stuffed in your pocket was Poom phrixus advice, and it was well meant very well meant, but when they passed by a well ballygally Gleb took the coupons from his pocket and tossed them down the well. Pontefract turned him about and took him back to the couch in the corridor and told him to sit tight. Never had he encountered such denseness it left him in a lather. Once he was out of sight of brigly glad he biffed his fists against a wall. That day, there were no further coupons for Bleakley, grab But I did have one token left in the pot. It was a lovely little token round and shiny and stamped with the head in profile of Tippi Hedren will give him that they decided and sew it into a cloth PICHETTE and so the PICHETTE into his pocket, and that way the token won't follow the coupons down the well. Poom frakes nodded. He could see the beauty in the scheme. But density was ballygally Gleb twittered them all. When Poom frakes led him out into the bounteous fields again with the token in the PICHETTE sown fast inside his pocket. He let go pump Rex's hand at a critical moment and ran towards the well and jumped into it. When they eventually received the permissions, they sent a salvage team to recover the coupons and the token and whatever was left to brigly Gleb. His soul had fled. The soul of Poom frakes was still intact, but it was dented and battered beyond repair. and thereafter he was to be found in mountainous terrain among goat a shadow of his former tea strainer dynasty self.

After several minutes bidding farewell for the goats Poom freq descended from his mountain a mountain fastness is unexpected return home to tea strainer house family pile of the centuries old poo frakes tea strainer manufacturing dynasty was not unlike the unexpected return home of Charles Rainier in random harvest, Mervyn Leroy 1942. Just as we weep uncontrollably at any viewing of that film, so there was weeping within the walls of tea strainer house and outside in its gardens to there was one significant difference. Charles Ramya, played by Ronald Coleman 1891 to 1958. Sports a dapper moustache Poom Franks did not. He had grown one once in his youth when first able to, but it sprouted in an entirely different color to the rest of his hair, which at that time was brownie torgny chest nutty with flecks of ginger and black. The color of the incipient mustache was indescribable. It appeared to be a shade out with the known spectrum. And that's it provoke remark, usually unkind remark, and this was unwelcome to Poom frakes, who in his youth was shy, and self conscious. He was no longer so, but he chose never to revisit moustache land. He felt himself touched by the copious weeping, which greeted his return, and prance like a ninny through all the halls and corridors of his beloved home, blowing kisses and waving his arms. He gave little thought to the sad fellow with the coupons. He had been paid to escort and overthrown himself down a well practiced communion with goats in the mountains had restored the boisterous and bright eyed optimism which came naturally to him. whence it came was a deep mystery, for all the other members of his clan was somber and sour and moody and pernickety and rancorous and morose and always always weeping, gushing great buckets of tears have the faintest of plaques on their heartstrings but he was happy to be home, and he avoided the sounds of constant wailing and keening once he had done his tour of the house by taking a turn around the gardens here with a Phil but hedges and how has that lupins and hollyhocks and topiary tea strainers of his childhood. Memories came flooding back as he pronounced like a ninja In the torrential rain, he remember the day he saw gnomes hiding behind the hedges. They remembered the great watering can party. He remembered the visit of Neville Chamberlain with his odd shaped head. He remembered lying on his back on the lawn in the middle of the night, gazing up at obsolete constellations of stars. He remembered digging rusconi and holes and filling them with conquers. He remembered Mr. Snip edge, the old head gardener, who looked like the aged Ruskin, and Mike Ruskin had hallucinate revisions of snakes. While poop Rex was happily remembering all these things in the garden, and other custom silence had fallen inside the house, there was no longer any weeping, no wailing nor keening. Just like in Three Days of the Condor. Sydney Pollack 1975 were CIA analyst Joe Turner, played by Robert Redford, born 1936 pops out of the office for five minutes and returns to find all his colleagues have been slaughtered. So when Poom frakes stepped back in through the fringe windows, he discovered that every single occupant of tea strainer house had been done to death, while he was prancing like a ninny around the garden. Poof Rex had a nose for crime, as he wandered through the halls and corridors of his beloved home, counting the bodies. One idea impressed itself with more and more intensity upon his brain. This thought must be the work of the lumbering walrus mustache serial killer babinski.

Dobson rarely sought collaborators in his pamphleteering work, preferring to plow his fire alone. Occasionally, however, his schemes were so ambitious, that it was necessary to call in help. One such plan led to the formation of what became known as the soup committee. Dobson woke up one Winfrey morning with an idea in his head. This was not uncommon, but usually his ideas could be and worth dashed off in a brief pamphlet. Not so the gigantic multi volume work he pictured in his mind, a compendium of every known Soup Recipe ever conceived throughout human history, from the dawn of time to today's date, across all cultures and civilizations. Even Dobson realized that he could not accomplish so mighty a project single handed, so he asked marigold crew to drop a list of likely contributors. The soup committee was her idea, reasoning that if she invited people to take part in a Dobson plan, they would probably decline and thus shatter the pamphlet is already shattered nerves. She used her usual hardline tactics. The letter she sent out to over 800 unsuspecting souls is preserved in the Dobson archive. Dear soup person, it read. This is to inform you that you have been impaneled onto the soup committee. Your employment is effective from today's date, and remains in force until such time as you die. The full implications of your membership of the committee will follow by a separate post, but you would better start gathering soup recipes right now. Yours decisively marigold to pp. Dobson. The pamphleteer himself decided to begin it by garnering soup recipes from the Old and New Testament, and said about rereading his Bible with pencil and notepad in hand. It was destroyed at the end of this exercise to discover that the word soup appears nowhere in the Authorized Version or King James Bible, which With the addition he swore by, he went back to the beginning and realized that pottage was possibly a synonym for soup. Although it might also mean what we know is true. undeterred, Dobson was able to fill a couple of pages of his Notepad. In Genesis 25, for example, we have 29 and Jacob sad pottage, and Esau came from the field and he was faint. And Esau said to Jacob, feed me, I pray the weed that same red pottage, for I am faint, therefore, was his name called Eden. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way. Thus, Esau despised his birthright. This is elsewhere translated as, and Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, of course, a resounding phrase we would all do well to remember. Moving on to the second Book of Kings, chapter four, after having soup for lunch, Dobson, read. And Elijah came again to Gil gal, and there was a dearth in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said unto His servant, set on the great pot, and seize pottage for the sons of the prophets. And one went out into the field to gather Herbes and found a wild vine and gathered their of wild gourds his lap fall, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, Oh, thou man of God, there is death in the pot, and they could not eat they're off. Towards the end of the Old Testament, Dobson found one last mention of soup or stew, in had guy to 12. If one bear holy flesh, in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt, do touch bread, or pottage or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy, and the priest answered, and said, No.

seven verses, but presumably only three different suits, the most interesting to Dobson being the one in Kings, which has death in the pot. What was this poisonous potion? We know that Dobson was a vain even arrogant pamphleteer, but he did have some small shred of humility. He recognized that if it's great work on soup was to be definitive. Every single recipe would have to be authorized by an expert marigold to send a second letter to the members of the committee. Dear impaneled subcommittee person she wrote, as a matter of urgency further details are required on the wild gold, which was shredded into the potty mentioned in two kings for 39 as well as the ingredients already in the pot, which as you know, contained death. Send your reply by Korea, yours, tenaciously, marigold, true, pp Dobson. Not a single one of the recipients ever replied. And Dobson himself soon lost interest in soup recipes.

I think we've got time for the very end, fill his father's notes away and embarks that very same winter on a series of pamphlets about sodium postage stamp, the manufacturer of church bells, loosely fitting cardigans, gutta percha plus fluctuations and Plovdiv. One by one over the years, the subcommittee members died out, it is thought that only three of them are still alive. And that's the end.
