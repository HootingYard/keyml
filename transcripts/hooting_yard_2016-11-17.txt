Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. This is hosting yard on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm sucking a locket. Actually, other other proprietary cough sweets are available. Anyway, sorry about that. I will try and read while getting rid of this. And it's been a year for great figures in the music business of the film industry, indigo TV to keep dropping dead on us. Started with David Bowie at the beginning of the year. And now Leonard Cohen as a homage to Leonard Cohen. Here's a piece I wrote this actually a few years ago. But I thought I'd repeat it this week. As I say in homage to the great Leonard who I have a very I have a great deal of time for I think I remember when I was about 14, I read his novel beautiful losers. And I don't remember much about it. Other than the fact that it keeps babbling on about Katherine tekakwitha some some kind of indigenous Canadian saint. Yeah, I don't really remember much about it, but I did read it when I was about 14. I thought it was a work of genius. But I was 14. Anyway, this this might be a work of genius, though I say so myself. This is my Hallmark. Cohen tells us in his song Suzanne, that, quote, there are heroes in the seaweed. Unquote. I really, I asked myself, not without a dash of skepticism. And what precisely would heroes be doing, disporting themselves in the Sargassum and the kelp. Still, one does not wish to dismiss out of hand the words of a figure of such stature, so I summoned my sidekick and went to investigate. out by the aerodrome, we boarded a shower bank heading for the seashore. But not before arming ourselves, each with a long and pointy stick. These I explained to my somewhat dim the sidekick we would use to poke about the seaweed In Search of Heroes. He seemed satisfied with this intelligence. But as the Shara bank gathered speed, crossing the wild and windy malls, he babbled questions at me. which particular heroes were they that were to be found in the seaweed, heroes of ancient Greece, such as Hercules and Theseus and Jason and bellerophon tragic heroes such as rsds and Oedipus and Hamlet, Byronic heroes, guitar heroes, boy's own paper heroes, or modern day superheroes, such as Batman and Spider Man and unconscious squirrel, the unconscious squirrel, or wood we find entangled in the seaweed, representatives of all of these types of heroes and more. And were they trapped in the seaweed struggling heroically to escape from it? Or have they made it their natural habitat, nesting in it as it were, even perhaps, feeding off it? I was fairly sure Karen had not addressed these questions in his song. But to be on the safe side, I decided to listen to it again. Pointing out of the shower bank window at a flock of starlings to distract my sidekicks attention and shut him up. I grabbed into my ears, the tiny headphones have my idol entered, and pressed play. Precisely three minutes and 49 seconds later, I removed the headphones and turn to my sidekick. He was still staring out of the window, mouth open, dribbling Vova starlings and long vanished and the only bird visible in the sky was alone Lark or it might have been a swift or even an avocet. I know nothing of Ornithology.

Cohen does not expand upon his assertion, I said. So we shall have to poke about with our long pointy sticks and see what we shall see. First, though, I think we're both in need of refreshment. So we'll stop at the seaside kiosk for some tea and oranges that come all the way from China. My sidekick was happy with this suggestion, and he grinned. It is never a pretty sight, so I closed my eyes. Earlier that day, I had climbed the whole mountainside to wash my eyelids in the rain. Richard passed me out something awful, and no sooner when my eyes shut, and I fell into a snooze. When I woke the shower bank was parked in a lay by the seashore. I was the only passengers still aboard. Even my sidekick had gone. I disembarked and made my way to the kiosk, where I was sure I would find him stuffing his God with Chinese oranges. The Kiosk was bolted and shattered, but by following a trail of spilt tea and strips of Chinese orange peel, I soon cracked down my sidekick he was scrounging about in a tide pool, poking his long pointy stick into it. Have you spared any heroes? I called? Nope, he replied. Just sculpins and Kelly fiction blennies and yellow sponge fishin see stars and CQ combos, and sea urchins and sand shrimps and lobsters and crabs, and hermit crabs and Greenline shore crabs and barnacles, a nudibranchs and Titans and mussels and scallops and abalone knees and limpets and snails, and a sea an enemy. No sign at all of orde Wingate, or Captain James T. Kirk, to pluck back to heroes at random. Nope. I went to sit on a slimy Boulder. It occurred to me that heroes might be more likely to swim about in the open sea, festooned with seaweed like mermaids, we would have to hire a rubbing boat to extend our quest. It also occurred to me that it would be cheaper and far less tiresome to conclude that Kevin had no idea what he was talking about. Come sidekick I called throw away your long pointy stick and let us catch the shower bank home before darkness falls. And so we did, but we never made it home. For long before we reach the bus stop by the aerodrome the shower bank driver killed the lights in a lonely lane, and an ape with Angel glands, erased the final wisps of pain with the music of rubber bands.

Bear with me a second while I find the next piece I want to read to you. It's nothing to do with Leonard Cohen as far as I can recall, but I will find it. I'm just scrolling through some material from the hooting yard website. Just to remind you the hooting yard website is hooting yard.org and I've scrolled right past it and hooting owl.org. And if you go there, there's enormous amounts to read. And I don't know how I've managed to lose what I wanted to read to you. But I have so I'm going to babble briefly Until I can find it shouldn't be too long now, but it's part of a trilogy. And I'm going to read to you that entire trilogy. So bear with me and I'll find it and we can all have a final time listening to it when I can find it. Let's have some music.

Aha founded. Crikey. crocky. exclaimed his van. What in the name of Heaven is that? his twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book. He was reading his plan, calm down, he drawled. You know, I hate to be interrupted in my reading, especially when the book in my hand is the journals of Jared Manley Hopkins. And I have just got to the entry for that most exciting day, the 27th of April 1871, when the poet quote, mesmerized a duck, with chalk lines drawn from her beak, sometimes level and sometimes forwards on a black table.

How on earth can you immerse yourself in the pros of a Victorian Jesuit screeched his van when I'm about to be waylaid by preposterous Lee complicated mechanical contraption, somehow imbued with almost human malevolence, Zoltan yawned.

It was the indigestion machine.

Crikey claimed his van. He had just noticed that a fierce gigantic elephant like being was thundering towards him and that he was almost certain to be crushed to death within the next few seconds. Have you ever read the anatomy of melancholy? asked his twin brothers Zoltan, who was reclining who was really reclining in a hammock safely out of the path of the fears gigantic elephant like being Zoltan was speaking through a shiny red loud hailer sees taunting me with 17th century prose, cried his plan. Is it beyond your puny wits to see that I'm about to be flattened by a fierce gigantic elephant like being? Oh, I wouldn't worry about that drawl dog fan. It will be stopped in its tracks by the man who is at this very moment careering across the verdant green sward bent on intercepting it. path.

For just then, the said Mahood leaped astride the fist gigantic elephant like being and coaxed it to a halt.

Crikey. exclaimed van, as he pulled the lever on the incomprehensible big magnetic robot. That to turn up for the book, observed his twin brothers altar. And what book would that be asked his van as the incomprehensible big magnetic robot clanked and word into action, thumping and migratory. It began to cross the Buttercup splattered Meadow in which this exciting scene takes place. It made his brand think of a Golem such as implacable menace. What do you know of literature snared Zollverein, but this fan was already rummaging in his brother's satchel. Moments later, he held triumphantly aloft a dog eared paperback zoals an item closely, your arm shot up in phallic conspiracy, he quoted his tranexamic the curiously stained cover of the book, he was severely myopic.

And now I'd like to read you a series of film titles, which, occasionally with a little capsule reviews, not all of them, but some of them have little comments upended. And these are all films that will be appearing on television in the next few weeks according to my sources. Rusty flasks the apothecaries safety pin The sub fast gargoyle handed me that caffeine topiary and miscegenation for gutta percha pale, the vivid swamp the pitiful teacup to smooth and smooth again. The baleful rhinoceros. 400 wooden hens, plankton nightmare the crumpled ships, the queasy hotel, the pathetic ornithologist, the flapping wind sock appointment of incomprehensibility. I wore my hats in that prickly custard gas attack. flailing Shibboleth journey to the planet of indigestion.

Rubber butt yells at Bob tea strainers in jeopardy. The tool none goes West. Starling wore a cardigan ornate and lavish boys be you over oy s. The tidy cakes. The incredible case of the disparage chutney recipe, splendid mark and weird birds. I missed out all the critical comments on those films because that would have interrupted the flow.

For 400 men and women of the blister mine cormorant patrol brandished their pencil sharpeners, toffee apples and inaccurate atlases as they reach the peak of the tour after marching all day below them beyond the pig huts the curiously stained bridge and the abandoned swimming Barb's they were just able to see shrouded in mist the famous or infamous Rotana under tantalum pond, so dried up after successive droughts that they went out a little more than puddles. onwards, cried Captain Federico Gwyneth Paltrow, undisputed leader of the cormoran patrol, and the man whose stupendous energy had helped it thrive, even through such a lean times. Seldom has a puny and diminutive physiognomy been so misleading. And so began their descent. Three quarters of the way down the newest recruit, Faye young Daisy Ricardo montell. Bam, stopped in her tracks, pointed and yelled out, look, look, something with a beak and feathers. And indeed, as I peered through the enshrouding mist, the other saw it to perched on the branch of a withered punkten tree, sprouting hopelessly on the banks of one of the ponds or puddles. excitedly, they began running capering and gambling down the muddy slope of the tour. But as they closed upon their prey, they realized it was not a cormorant at all. It was a little bitten

I'm going to read you one of my favorite quotations. And once I am, for reasons I cannot quite remember, I typed into Google, the phrase crumpled, Jesuit. And just to say what came up. And the first thing that I think it was the first thing that came up or the only thing that came up

excuse me, was this quotation from a piece in the Plain Dealer for July 1999, written by the dance critic Wilma saulsbury. And you have to imagine the picture she paints with words. It's quite fantastic. Anyway, this is this is what she wrote. As an introduction to the Jesuit priest choreography, calm performed, overwhelmed and expressionist, expressionistic evocation of a dark emotional state that suggested sacred dance only in a few gestures of prayer. set to a recording of prepared piano music by john cage. The brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying in a heap as the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Khan had disappeared and the EAC had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the floor, he cried out to God ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded his fist against the rear wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed in lyrical movements by 10 dancers who had learned the graceful choreography in EAC workshop.

If you go to the hooting our website and look around very carefully, you can actually find a fantastic black and white photograph of father Bob eek, who is a American Jesuit priest and dance, well, dance choreographer and a dancer. And in fact, if you go to YouTube, you can even see some of his performances, not unfortunately overwhelmed, which has to be I just love the idea of this crumpled, Jesuit getting up from the stage and running around crying out to God and thumping his fists on the walls. Overwhelmed indeed, that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I'm afraid I won't be here next week, because I will be in the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all drink and they drink and they drink and they drink once again, or whatever the lyrics for that song God. I won't be drinking, but I will be in the port of Amsterdam. So I'll be back in two weeks. Meanwhile, keep Well yeah, you know, the usual stuff. And once again, many thanks to Johnny seven for engineering the show so expertly. Bye bye.
