Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM, live from London. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. Sorry, I wasn't here last week. But I'm back now. And we've got a special show this week, which is entirely devoted to the animal kingdom. Dogs, vultures, and bats. Pretty much I think. And there might be times there's time for anything else. That will be Well, not quite the animal kingdom but marathon runners, which are probably almost in the animal kingdom. Anyone who can run 26 miles in one go can't be fully human. Anyway. Dogs. I'm very grateful to the blog wonders and Marvels, which you should visit. for drawing to my attention the important topic of the naming of dogs in ancient Greece. This is a subject I've always taken very seriously, in spite of the fact that I've never owned a dog myself. Indeed, ever since the age of four when I was struck darmanin Mobile with Terre by Mrs. flax, huge, black spittle fleck, groundling hound, I have been cautious around dogs. Mrs. flack was a friend of my mother's. it's indicative of changing customs that have a lapse in formalities that I have no idea for first name. The Friends of my parents were invariably known to me, and I was expected to address them as Mr. or Mrs. As with so much else from my childhood, it seems like a lost world. Much too is lost due to my pitiable memory. But I certainly remember Mrs. flagged dog, we'd gone to visit this friend one day before I was a school age. And while my mother and Mrs. flack chatted away in the kitchen, I was deposited in an armchair in the living room, perhaps with a glass of milk and a biscuit and a comic to pass the time. Another hint of a lost past is that I was not deposited in front of a television set. At some point into the room pattern a huge black spittle flecked hound, which planted itself in front of me groundling, quite obviously preparing to pounce and sink its fangs into my little infant throat. I wanted to cry out for help, but I was so frightened, I could neither make move nor make a sound. I was eventually rescued by Mrs. flack popping into the room, seeing my stricken state, and leaving the ungodly beast, which had not after all, attacked me yet away, assuring me it was a lovable, harmless pooch. In subsequent years, I've noticed that dog owners always make such assurances, which I treat with deserved contempt. I remain convinced that the vast majority of dogs of whatever size mean me harm, and we'll tear out my vitals given half a chance. Nevertheless, dog nomenclature has always been a subject of interest to me, as has the nomenclature of other domestic pets. I would not claim it is an intense interest, like say, the Munich air disaster or the Kennedy assassination, or the glory of birdlife in all its avian forms, but it is something I find diverting, understand I don't spend all my time thinking up names for putative dogs on my own in some parallel universe, where I'm a keen, even avid dog lover, and was never traumatized in my infancy by Mrs. flax, huge black spittle, flecked corralling hound. To do so would be foolish. But still, every now and then I find myself considering the names of dogs. And so the title of the wonders and Marvels blog post was bound to attract my attention. Names of dogs in ancient Greece, it announced and I immediately stopped or whatever else I was doing, so I could bone up on the subject, one which I admit I've never given any thought to whatsoever. The Ancient Greece bit that is so what did I learn among other things, and I quote,

Frank Key  05:05
an ancient Greek vast painting of 560 bc shows Atlanta and other heroes and their hounds, killing the great Caledonian bear bore. Seven dogs names are inscribed on the vase, homie, nos, impulse method pawn pursuer, Edgar tease, vigilant corax Raven, Mark sath lab Ross labrosse fears and you bolos shooter I have to say I'm a little peeved that we're not told the meaning of mob sass. Perhaps it doesn't mean anything is just a word or sound that sprang into the head of an ancient Greek person when confronted with a new as yet nameless puppy. But it would be helpful to be told, otherwise I might lie awake all night wondering about it. Anyway, the piece goes on and I quote again, the Roman poet, Ovid, gives the Greek names of the 36 dogs that belong to acteon, the unlucky hunter of Greek myth, who was torn apart by his pack. Among them were tigress, lilacs, storm, Aiello, whirlwind, and our Cath bear Pollux list 15 dog names. Another list is found in columella. The longest list of suitable names for ancient Greek dogs 46, in all, was compiled by the dog whisperer, a Zento, from popular names for dogs in antiquity, translated from Greek include lurcher, whitey, Blackie, Tony blue blossom, keeper, fencer, butcher, spoiler, hasty Hurry, stubborn Yelp, tracker, dash, happy, jolly trooper, rock dove, Growler fury, Riot alarms, pell mell, plucky killer, craft the swift and dagger, on quote, again, it might have been helpful to give full rather than partial list, telling us the numbers but then giving only a few samples is the kind of thing that can get me steamed up if I'm already in a bad mood. Luckily, I was not in a bad mood today quite the opposite for I'm always pleased by rainfall, especially in summer. In the Guardian the other day, there was a quotation from the diaries of Kenneth Williams, in which he wrote, this was one of those dark rainy mornings that I love. I would echo that. Still, even though I would have preferred to be given fuller and further information, I was pleased to discover what I did about the dog name is of ancient Greece. And you will be too if you go and read the full article, particularly the whole business about Xenophon being a dog whisperer. Meanwhile, it occurred to me that just as I never learned Mrs. flax first name, nor did I ever find out the name of the great slobbering brute that terrorized me. Perhaps, if I could give it a name even now, so many years later, I might be able to overcome my fear of dogs. I know that Growler and killer a given in one of the lists above, both of which would be perfectly appropriate. But I think I'm going to retrospectively dub Mrs. Flag dog rock dove. That sounds a bit weedy for a dog. Even a terrified four year old could cope with a dog called rock dove, even if it was huge and black and spittle flecked and groundling.

So in that piece about dogs, dog nomenclature, there were some changes When autobiographical material and there is more genuine autobiographical material coming up the True, true stories from the life of Mr. K. Recalling the incident of Mrs. flack and her terrifying hound, I mentioned that I was kept occupied and entertained not by children's television, but by a comic. That set me thinking about the comics I read when I was taught at one time or another, I was a devotee of The Beano the dandy RAM, the topper, and wizard and chips, and may have been others but those are the ones I remember. And I remember certain characters topper of the track, Billy Wiz Gen jumbo, and grimly fiendish the latter, who bore a startling resemblance to the contemporary television person, Dora O'Brien. They were all regulars with their own scripts, but for some reason burned into my brain is another character, who as I recall, only ever appeared in a single story. This was an evil German secret agent called Weems. And I remember him simply because his name was Wiens. It was the Word, the sound that caught my attention. And I have another fragmentary memory of an episode in a story, which helped me spell bound. But in this case, I'm not sure why. The story itself I have forgotten, it was a Western and I wasn't a great fan of westerns. Sure enough, my brother and I played cowboys and Indians in the new t field, or new field. But when immersed in my comics, I had more compelling claims on my attention, evil German secret agents called Weems, for example. But there was this one episode in the story, which I have never forgotten. A cowboy had somehow managed to get himself lost and abandoned in the desert. He was at the end of his tether, and had collapsed in the dust above him. vultures wheeled in the sky. The text made plain to my infant mind, that when eventually the stricken cowboy perished of hunger and thirst and exposure, the vultures would swoop down upon his corpse, and gobble him up. At least, that is what the text intended to make plain. But I somehow misunderstood it. I thought the vultures would swoop if he closed his eyes. Not if he fell asleep, and that's looked as if he were dead. No, the vultures were circling, waiting for him to shut his eyes for an instant, at which point they would swoop and tear him to pieces with their savage beaks and talents. Not surprisingly, my reading of the situation see or misreading of the situation, seeing the most terrifying predicament one could fall into. I practiced lying in bed, keeping my eyes open for as long as possible, desperately trying not to blink to prepare myself for the inevitable time when I would be uprooted from a suburban Council of State and tossed alone and abandoned into the desert. I kept an eye out for any vultures which might appear looming with malignant menace in the ethics sky. As a good Roman Catholic, I added a plea to be kept safe from vultures to my bedtime prayers. What strikes me recalling this in the cold light of adulthood is the astonishing lack of basic common sense. Now wonder my mother used to warn me in her thick Flemish accent that one of these days you will go out without your head.

Frank Key  14:30
That head now contain the unshakable conviction that vultures filled the sky, and we're simply waiting for a person below to shut their eyes. You did not need to be sprawled exhausted in the desert dust. You might be scampering along on your way to the nudie field for example, and blink, and if a vulture were in the vicinity, it would swoop down upon you and rip you to shreds. I lived in a state of terror Here is what I do not remember. What became of the cowboy in the comic strip? Did he somehow survive or was he packed to pieces? It may be that I was so unhinged by the thought of malevolent circling vultures that I stopped reading and there and then began practicing keeping my eyes open. When did it occur to me that I had never seen a vulture in the ethics sky. Or could I be sure I had not. I was after all mile thick from an early age, possibly because I strained my eyes by attempting not to blink for protracted periods. All those birds up in the sky looked vaguely similar blurs to me. I did know that a vulture was bigger than say, a sparrow, but that was about as far as my ornithological knowledge went. How long did I live in fear of vultures? There must have come a point where I felt my prayers have been answered that I had been kept safe and most cogently. Not only had I not been attacked by vultures, but I had never seen or heard of such an attack happening to anybody else. The day must have come, surely, I presume, when I was able to go about my tiny business outdoors. Without giving vultures I thought, If only I'd kept a diary at the time, I could pin down the date for it was surely one of the signal moments of my childhood. That day, when I paired up at the sky, a blue or gray blur, and I consciously closed my eyes without a care in the world.

Frank Key  17:54
So there there are two, you must get the impression and listeners that I was some kind of terrified infant, terrified of dogs and vultures. Actually, I was no one. Yeah, I was. Anyway, as far as I can recall, I don't think there's anything autobiographical in this next piece, which is about bats, or indeed one particular bat, the whiskey bat. The whiskey bat, excuse me. The whiskey bat was first identified by Edward Lear in his poem, The quango dangles hat of 1877. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that it was only identified by layer, as nobody before or since, seems to have had a word to say that existence. Believe me, I've done the research. The initial problem I had to solve was whether whiskey was part of the formal nomenclature of this type of bat, or whether Lear was referring to a generic bat and applying a descriptive adjective. The capitalization of the ski, I should point out in the poem about Pesci and bat both have capital letters, the capitalization of Biscay would suggest the former, that bat is also capitalized in the text. So who knows? If bisquit is a general adjective, it is one that has been neglected by the Oxford English Dictionary, and by all the other standard dictionaries, there is a slim possibility that it may have something to do with biscuits, but it's hard to understand what might be biscuit like a batter bat. You might bake a biscuit in the shape of a bat. But that would be a batty biscuit, not a biscuit bat. I concluded after Mark farrowing of the Browns smoking quite a few Gospels. That brisky was indeed the formal name of a type of bat. Now my knowledge of the world I bat is breathtaking. One of my party pieces which never fails to enliven even the most straight laced and sober of social gatherings is to reel off in a dramatic tone of voice. A list of bats. I really need prompting. And you know what, I don't need prompting right now. Some bats then the Asian false vampire bat, the Asian painted bat, the big brown bat, the big free tailed bat, the Brandt bat, the Brazilian free tailed bat. The brown long Ian bat, the California leaf nosed bat, the common yellow shouldered bat, the door Bunton back, the desert red bat, the eastern long eared bat. The Eastern pipistrelle. The Egyptian fruit bat, the evening bat, the Florida Maspeth bat. The fringe lift bat, Jeff Roy's raid bat, the giant Indian fruit bat. The Golden Horseshoe bat, the grey bat, the greater Bulldog bat, the greater horseshoe bat, the greater long nosed bat, the greater spear nosed bat. The hoary bat, the Honduran white bat, the Indiana bat, the Ipanema bat, team's bat or the northern bat. The lapage Brown bat, lifeless bat, the letter horseshoe bat, the letter long nosed bat. Linnaeus is false vampire bat. The little brown bat, the long nose bat, the Mexican big eared bat, the Mexican fruit bat, the nut Susie's pipistrelle. natters back there knock to back the northern yellow back. But palyed back, the party callin back, Peters, Ghost faced bad Peters tent making bad Peters wooly falls vampire bat. That pipistrelle bat, the pocketed free tailed bat. The pygmy pipistrelle. Rafi neck big eared bat, the red bat. Rodriguez's fruit bat, the Seminole bat,

Frank Key  22:44
the Sarah time bat, the short tailed fruit bat, the silver head bat, the southeastern bat, the southern yellow bat, the spotted bat, the straw colored fruit bat, the sewer rat Sarah time back towns and begin bad Underwood's long tongue back. Underwood's massive band, the vampire bat, the western massive bat, the whiskered bad, the wrinkled face back and the yellow pad. This is by no means an exhaustive list of bats. I have not mentioned for example, the demonic tube nosed fruit bat, Veldkamp dwarf fo elekid fruit bat said alien aliens trumpeted bad the strange begin brown bat shall Ifans Twilight bat, the tiny yellow bat, the robust yellow bat, the equitorial dog faced bat coast all to bat, the Buffy flower bat, the hairy little fruit bat, nor the various smoky back. I could prattle on for hours, and perhaps include a diversion where I pointed out the amusing fact than an entire DRI that's a fruit bat is known as the dog Sonia, just like your favorite out of print pamphlet here. But no matter how long my party piece last, the one bat you will not hear mentioned is the disky bad. Now this is very odd. Edward Lear was a familiar double naturalist and he would hardly have invented a bat. I can only assume that he spotted one in 1877 or shortly beforehand, named it, wrote of it, and then went on his merry way, no doubt assuming other Batman persons would subject the bat to further study and yet they did not Having reached a dead end in my researches, it occurred to me that I could make profitable use of my time by attempting to draw a big ski bat. Now it has to be said that I'm a pretty cack handed draftsman. And not one of the hundreds of backdrop things I have made in the past bears much resemblance to a bat. I always have trouble with the wings. And those little eyes and the complex radar like navigation system bat rely on to get from A to B. But on this occasion, it would not be me doing the drawing, for I resolve to enter into a trance, and with my arms suspended from the elbow in a sling, and a pencil glued to my fingers. I would commune with a spirit guide. This guide would control the movement of the pencil across the paper before sinking into the trance, by means of mystic plawecki and breathing exercises. gibberish and listening to a Brian ino record. I went for a stroll and a smoke and I wondered if the spirit that communed with me would be Edward Lear himself, or perhaps another Victorian naturalist, one who had also spotted the pesky bat, but failed to recognize it properly, and where it was now taking the opportunity to make amends for his oversight. I would never know of course, for when I emerged from these trances my brain is as if wiped clean with a particularly effective disinfectant preparation. The other thing that happens when I emerge from these trances is that I'm confronted with a sheet of paper, on which I or the medium has scribbled and scraped a formless mess of squiggly quango wangle. I always forget that too. I haven't quite abandoned mine bizkey back research. However, I'm now working on the theory that the emphasis of the Oxford English Dictionary, and of all others standard dictionaries have somehow overlooked the word and that it does indeed exist as a common adjective. All I need to do now is to work out what it means.

And that's almost the end of hooting out on the air for this week, but I'll leave you with the first of our hooting yard. London 2012 Olympic update. Actually, this isn't a London 2012 Olympic update. It's a London 1908 Olympic update or backdate. I just wanted to let you know what the refreshments what refreshments were given to the runners in the marathon at the London 1908 Olympics. And this is absolutely true. muscatel grapes carves foot jelly with a lemon, new laid eggs soaked in tea, orange segments, Brandy, champagne, and small doses of strychnine. I'm hoping to get a contract to provide the refreshments to the marathon runners, get some supplies of cow's foot jelly and strychnine. And what am I talking about? Anyway, there might not be any other Olympic updates whatsoever because I frankly I'm fed up with the whole thing. But anyway, that's it for for me for this week. And everything else permitting. I'll be back next week. So bye bye bye bye.
