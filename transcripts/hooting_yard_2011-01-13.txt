Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. And this is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key. And as ever, I'm going to read to you for about half an hour. This is the first show of 2011, of course. And before we crack on, there's a few things to clear up from Christmas and the new year. We might as well get them out of the way before we properly proceed. The dabbler website, which is for which I've been writing a weekly column for the last few months, I did a Christmas Compendium and asked its various contributors to say what Christmas meant to them. And here is my response to that. And it grieves me to say it but everything that follows is absolutely true. It is always Christmas inside my head. More accurately, I could say that Christmas recurs on an almost daily basis through all the seasons of the year. This isn't a pleasant state of affairs, for the reason is the presence of a niggling and inexplicably persistent earworm, one of those songs or snatches of songs, that gets stuck in one's head and will not go away. How I suffer for listeners, I have to tell you that for some years now, the music lodged in my head more often than not, is happy Christmas war is over by the man amusingly described in a letter by Kenneth Williams as that Beatle who married an Asiatic woman, john lennon, not Ringo Starr, as Kenneth Williams mistakenly identified him certainly had a knack for vapid doggerel. But Happy Christmas war is over is particularly irritating. So this is Christmas, and what have you done? I think the correct answer to this hectoring question is I've been working tirelessly for world peace in between funding the IRA and purchasing the apartment next door for further coat storage space. Another year over and a new one just began. Well no john. New Year's Day is a week later. I won't proceed through the rest of this mawkish twaddle. And in truth, there are times when I managed to banish the ear worm after that opening couplet. But other times it continues. And I have to say there's a certain sense of relief when Yoko and the caterwauling Children's Choir strike up the tune. I mean, you have to love Yoko, don't you? There are occasional days when I'm blessed with other songs inside my head, but not many. Happy Christmas war is over has blighted my brain for two or three years now. And like Edward gorey is doubtful guest it shows no intention of going away.

Also, for the dabbler, I provided a summary of old keys Almanac. for over four centuries old keys Almanac has proved a spookily honoring guide to the coming 12 month. This year, the mysterious figure in the black cape who it is said communes with old key himself granted to the dabbler exclusive permission to publish these Oso cogent utterances not so exclusively Of course, because now they're, you're hearing them on resonance. So, old keys Almanac foretells that in the year of our Lord 2011 January, cones appear at the side of a road closure. February, scientists discover a new anagram of pol pot. March a Scribbler publishes a accuity in The Guardian. April down at the docks noise some oohs and bilgewater May the de Botton conundrum is solved to Universal rejoicing. Tune in a hotel a doctor demands his sausages July Vince Cable standard windswept upon Westminster Bridge. August the mighty look on the works of ozy Mandy yes and despair. September the crystal ball is cloudy but we described something about a footballer and his hamstring. October, eggs hatch on a farm. November the AI fry is launched a simulacrum of Stephen Fry that Witters incessantly and it's small enough to be placed in a wastepaper basket. December, Jesus Christ returns his image appearing on a slice of toast.

Unfortunately, a number of errors and infelicities crept into that summary of prognostications. This was due to some interference in the mystic communicate channels, probably the wrong sort of echo plasm on the line, and inaccurate Almanac is a worthless thing. So it's imperative that we set the record straight without further ado. In February, the new anagram discovered by boffins is not as I said, Of Pol Pot, but have you thanked Secretary General of the United Nations from 1961 to 1971. Yes, that you an April, we did not indicate the location of the docks where noise some oohs and bilgewater will ooze and be billed. The listener is referred to a comprehensive Gazetteer of docks harbors key sides, inlets and coves, together with startlingly accurate notes on the incidence of oohs and bilgewater. Deep study of this important volume will yield the answer. May, we ought to have pointed out that rejoicing at the cracking of the double bottom conundrum will be particularly raucous and unbridled in Switzerland, homeland of the great sage. July, Vince Cable will actually be standing windswept upon each of London's bridges in turn from east to west during the month. This is part of a government initiative, the ramifications of which will become apparent. August oza 19 NBS has asked us to point out that his proper title is ozium and DS, King of kings. Well, I say he asked, but it would be better to say he demanded in a deafening roar so loud that bird drop dead from the blue immensity of the sky, and small woodland creatures keels over from heart attacks. One crosses oza Mandy asked at one's peril. He has such a temper that King of Kings he's a proper caution. October a misprint for farm read Fram. any old seer can foretell what eggs will hatch on a farm. Old key is telling us that the hatching will take place on the Fram, the polar expedition ship commanded by nansen and Amundson, among others. The Fram is preserved in the Fram Museum in Oslo, though quite quiet to become a coupe for hens is an ineffable mystery. That's the thing about Sears and soothsayers like old key, they're witterings often make no sense whatsoever until after the event. November while we're on the subject of senseless Wittering. hundreds or thousands of letters poured in from listeners and readers eager for more details of the AI fry. Julian Assange has helpfully leaked top secret information from the I fried development team. So we now know that this easily disposable handheld device will come preloaded with over a million tweets on every subject under the sun. We've also learned that not only can it be placed in a wastepaper basket, but also crushed under your boot tossed into the sea, or smashed to smithereens with a hammer. December, Jesus Christ has asked us to point out that he not owes him and Diaz is king of kings, as he is also Lord of hosts, the Almighty and many another title. Besides, he also asks us to make clear that the authenticated image of oza man Diaz has never appeared on a slice of toast, nor indeed on any other food item suitable for snacks.

So that's Christmas and New Year out of the way and now we can move on to more pressing matters. 40 years ago, David Bowie demanded Lamy place and bake me pie, not unreasonably in the circumstances. As he added I'm starving for me gravy. We've all I think being there, as they say nowadays, I've certainly had gravy hankerings of my own, most recently this very morning. Oddly enough, the first stirrings of a gravy craving stole upon me. Shortly after I'd finished my breakfast of eggy cornflakes and smokers pop tarts. I left the house to take a turn around the duck pond over by the viaduct, and there came a constriction in my throat, a throbbing in the head and a Pang in the belly. gravy. I thought, I'm starving for me gravy. I was unlikely to find any other duck pond. So I wheeled about and set off in the opposite direction towards the parade of shops. Past the Hatters and the Haberdashers on the ironmongers, there is a pie shop. To my dismay, I saw that it shutters were down, and there was no aroma of baking. I hammered my fist upon the shutters and screech the words of David Bowie quoted above. Clearly, gravy starvation was playing havoc with my common sense, for as I well knew, the pie shop did not have an in store dining facility. So even had it been open. I could not sensibly have demanded that my place be laid. I made such a din that the iron monger came out of his shop next door to see what was afoot. He was armed with a sample of his ironmongery a wrench or a crowbar and who can blame him. I was hardly the picture of an upstanding citizen in my gravy, famished hysteria. He dealt may a hefty thump on my cranium and used harsh words sprawled on the paving slabs. I gasped an apology for causing such a racket. I was about to explain that I was starving for me gravy. When the ironmonger recognized me. Good grief stipendiary landgrave suivent to the county Infanta. It is you he cried and immediately proceeded to mumble his own fawning apology helping me to my feet and dusting me down as he did so Unhand me trades person. I barked. Just tell me why the pie shop is shut when I'm in need of me gravy. By such direct questioning did I learn that the pie shop proprietor had taken leave of absence to attend an important festival in a neighboring land. He had left at dawn apparently in a cabriolet, both his face and that of his horse daubed with cosmetics in the guise of Aladdin Sane. I'd forgotten all about the Bowie THON with well practiced arysta cratic disdain, I tossed a coin to the ironmonger and told him to return to the shop. Then I continued along the parade towards all Mrs. Snuggle B's Dickensian dining parlor, a place of grease and spoons, only to discover that she too had left town. And for the same reason, though the urging begging outside her door, told me she was an afficionado of the Berlin trilogy, and had gone to the festival under Japanese influence in a kemono clutching her set of Brian he knows Oblique Strategies cards. I needed a no bleak strategy of my own. If I was going to get me grazie. I decided to pop along to the palace to call on the county Infanta after all, I was her stipendiary landgrave persuasive and so I was always welcome. She was a tiny little thing being an Infanta and I suspected she had not yet graduated to solid foods. That being the case, there might well be some gravy available. I bustled passed the sergeant at arms and made straight for the palace kitchen. I did not expect expect to see the Infanta herself in these lowly skivvies quarters, but there she was gurgling away, sitting in a tin can. I am about to feed her. infantis her elevenses, said the cook. Would you like some? I was appalled by the cooks overfamiliar tone. But so gravy deranged the lie let it pass. I will if she's having gravy, I cried.

Oh, no. When she's sitting in her tin, can I make her swallow a couple of protein pills, said the cook. Dammit. I could have tried pulling rank but I was fraught and weary. I wolf down some protein pills reached over to the sideboard for a helmet, put the helmet on and climbed into the tin can next to the Infanta soon, thanks to the palaces, winch and pulley apparatus, we would be floating far above the moon. There is no gravy on the moon.

As one of the world's leading monkey annoyance experts I'm regularly pressed by people to give handy hints on ways to annoy monkeys. For example, I might be leaning against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party and be importuned biased, sophisticated cocktail party goer, demanding to be told how he or she might best annoy a monkey. Invariably, I replied that I do not actually spend my time devising ways to annoy monkeys as a hobby or pastime. But I am in fact, a serious and dedicated scientist whose object of study is the neurological complexity of the monkey brain. Excuse me, no matter how sophisticated they are, my interlocutors are always disappointed to hear this and move off across the drawing room to strike up a new cocktail party conversation with somebody more amusing than me. Personally, I can think of few activities more foolish than to deliberately annoy a monkey. When For example, I shot a monkey in a room with a flying squirrel. I do so in the interest of science, not because it gives me a big belly laugh to watch how annoyed the monkey becomes. In any case, I'm too busy keeping an eye on my monkey brain scan monitors and other precision gubbins even to crack a smile. Now and then it's true. One of my research assistants might chuckle at the monkeys annoyance, but when that happens, I punch the assistant on the jaw and transfer them to janitorial mopping duties for a week. They soon learn. I recall first becoming fascinated by annoyed monkeys. When I was a small child. My parents kept a pet monkey named Harrison, and it often became annoyed. Now I realize its annoyance was due to the presence of my parents other pet, a flying squirrel named birtwhistle. It took many long years of grueling study for me to discover this after all, Harrison might have been annoyed by many other things, such as my father's habit of tapping his pipe on railings, or my mother's stapled gum, or my sister's frosty icing pallava especially on Sundays. These things annoyed me, so why should they not annoyed the monkey? Only after enrolling in a baccalaureate in monkey annoyance at a large and important seat of learning, did it begin slowly to dawn on me that birtwhistle the Flying Squirrel could be the primary cause of Harrison the monkeys annoyance. By the time my studies were complete, and I published my world shattering paper on monkey annoyance. Both the pets were dead, as well my parents, my sister, meanwhile, had run off to an ashram with a yogi. I have since published several other papers equally brilliant on further monkey annoyances. Now, I'm ready to go beyond annoyance to rage. And I'm investigating advanced methods of in raging monkeys. So if you should encounter me at a sophisticated cocktail party, I do not ask what is it? Let's go and make our visit to the enraged monkey lab where you can see for yourself how tirelessly I probe with the inner workings of the monkey brain and your brain to if your brain resembles that of a monkey, which it probably does. Judging by the people I meet at the sophisticated cocktail parties to which I'm invited. There's Further reading about monkey annoyance in the Christian Science Monitor, which shortly before that piece appeared contains the following headline, monkeys hate flying squirrels report monkey annoyance experts and followed by the subheader Japanese backpacks will completely flip out when presented with flying squirrels. A new study in monkey antagonism has found the research could pave the way for advanced methods of in raging monkeys. As I say that from the Christian Science Monitor, so there are a number of Monkey annoyance experts out there,

banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of my troubles. The font was hewn from adamantine rock, on the water it contained, though of necessity holy water was icy. When the priest slopped it onto my bashed head, I screamed at such a pitch that a stained glass window depicting the martyrdom of some bibley bib, spikes tongs fire was shattered, a falling shards sliced the priests juggler, and it collapsed, but not before dropping me into the font, while I splashed about boiling and freezing miniscule organisms with which the water was riddled swam into my ears and borrowed tiny tunnels into my brain, wherein they laid their eggs. If the organism if the organisms were miniscule, imagine how microscopically we were their eggs. Before I froze to death, I was plucked from the font by the Sexton, whose beard was so vast and hairy. I was almost suffocated as he clutched me to him gurgling I was passed to my mother, a woman of great dustiness, who endangered my life many a time in the following month, usually by taking me to unsuitable picnics, and suitable in that they took place in snowstorms or during beaumier weather on steep hillsides down which I would roll gathering paces I approached at the bottom, a railway line or major arterial thoroughfare along which huge container lorries thundered. Fortunately, though perplexingly the Sexton was always on hand to rescue me in the nick of time. Miraculously, I survived into toddlerhood. Around this time, my mother began to encourage me to play on the roof of our hotel during electrical storms. I was grateful for the rubber booties and LED lights. swaddling jacket the Sexton gave me more than one side toppled from the roof into the moat. And I soon learned to swim skillfully to dodge both the sharp fangs scavenger fish and the unexploded mines they're in. Regular swimming while wearing rayment have led does wonders to build up one's muscular strength. And sure enough, by my sixth birthday, my mother was exhibiting me at circuses and freak shows. I was known as Little dagobert, the strongest boy in the universe. Sometimes I came close to being flattened by the steam rollers I pulled across lawns and village greens, until the Sexton gave me a handy tip to avoid even the gentlest of downhill inclines. Being of an implausibly rare blood group, I had to be extra careful in the vicinity of sharp knives, axes and slicers. My caution served me well. When on my 10th birthday, my mother had me apprenticed to a well known butcher. He was a florid, chubby, deranged and blood drenched man, who took both pride and pleasure in his inhumane slaughtering methods. I was inconsolable for days after he slew the Sexton and chopped him to bits and made him into illegal pie fillings. I resolved to run away to see though we lived far, far from any coast. One crisp autumns dawn, I gathered my few pitiable belongings and tied them in a bundle and tied the bundle to the end of a stick, and with the stick propped jauntily over my shoulder, I set out to make my way in the world. Before I got so far as the garden gate, however, the microscopic eggs in my brain all hatched at once and let fourth monsters that I had passed through much travail in my short life, things were about to get much, much worse.

And that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it, we might find out what becomes a little Daigo Bert next week. Meanwhile, I suppose you could always as you as you go off to do something else or tune into the next show. In the break. You could always harm Happy Christmas wars either by that Beatle who married an Asiatic woman. Bye bye
