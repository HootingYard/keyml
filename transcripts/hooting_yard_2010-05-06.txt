You are indeed listening to resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key This is hooting yard on the air. And as a special treat this week, there's some kind of technical gubbins going on in the studio. So there might be some interesting background noises. But don't let that disturb you. In fact, just relish them. Anyway, lots lots to get through today, so a better crack on. And it's a wonder that in all the talk of the nation's parlous financial state, and of the need to reduce the deficit, none of the main or indeed minor political parties has suggested one particular way of raising revenue. It's been left to economics guru Bingley swelling to call for a werewolf tax. In a paper presented to the pointy town, pointy headed Think Tank last week, Professor swelling outlined with bullet points some of the benefits of such attacks. There were three bullet points in total of gold and silver and bronze, and it should be said that they were not made literally by firing bullets from a mannlicher carcano snipers rifle out of Lee Harvey Oswald, but represented by puncturing three holes in the professor's cardboard worksheet using a heavy duty hole punch from Huberman stationery department. The rim of each hole was then colored accordingly with lead based golden silver and bronze paint applied with a long handle paste wick brush of weasel hair. Beside the holes or points upon his cardboard, swelling, inked some text with a bio before propping the worksheet on a tubular metal display stand for easy viewing by the think tank is gathered to hear his I was going to say lecture, but that doesn't quite give the flavor of the swelling approach. not actually a werewolf himself, the professor nonetheless had the appearance of one. If his yellow bloodshot eyes, lumbering gait and shocking hairiness were not enough. His speaking voice was akin to a lupine how, whether the moon was full or otherwise. This made it hard to grasp what he was saying. Hence the pedagogical aid of the cardboard worksheet with its bullet points. There again, it would take a mind of infinite subtlety to interpret the hacking and stabbing marks made by the swelling vairo. His handwriting was atrocious, though in fairness, given the size and shape of his appendages, perhaps one should prefer the term poor writing. That's the paramount importance of the holes themselves and the colors of their painted rings. Anyway, here are some notes I took on the occasion. I hasten to add that I'm not a paid up pointy town, pointy head, but I know how to work my way into such meetings through Bolivarian mesmerism gold. werewolves often have enormous reserves of wealth in the form of precious stones hidden in caves. Sometimes these jewels are embedded in the heads of toads, the toads being kept in cages hung from the roots of the caves. Source, the hidden wolf Well, the hidden wealth of werewolves by Dobson out of print. Silver impossible to understand the first thing about this bullet point other than the assertion that at least 20 billion could be raised at a stroke, but 20 billion What? bronze swellings clincher a one off Alevi set at a swinging rate on all werewolves waylaid when attempting to embark on ships sailing across the mighty oceans, bound for the mythical Island, a werewolves source, the mythical island where werewolves think they come from by Dobson out of print. Unlike the pointy heads, who were wild eyed and nodding enthusiastically identified a number of problems with Professor swellings thesis, not least is over reliance on out of print pamphlets by Dobson as intellectual ballast. Still, even I have to admit that there's much here to chew over and queue over it. I shall, just as a werewolf might nor one's vitals having sunk its fangs into one's throat out on the Mall. On a moonlit night

for those of us whose knowledge of the world is gleaned almost exclusively from the out of print pamphlets of Dobson, it comes as a crushing blow to learn that he was absolutely wrong wrong wrong. In the matter of the mythical Island werewolves. You will recall because I've just told you that in his pamphlet, the mythical island where werewolves think they come from out of print. Dobson claims there is within the brain of everywhere, Wolf, some sort of false memory nugget which throbs with the sights and sounds and smells of a holy imaginary Island. This, he says, is thought by all werewolves to be their homeland, to which they are driven to return with an impulse as savage and other swayed dribble as their hunger for blood and guts. Hence, the danger of docks and harbors where werewolves roam trying to stow away aboard ships and clippers and ocean liners. You will also recall the thin the 1956 film bigger than life, James Mason as cortisone adult school teacher Ed Avery declaims as only James Mason could the line God was wrong. Shocking that may have been to a 1950s audience, but how much more shocking is it today to utter the words or even to entertain the thought Dobson was wrong. Yet unbelievably, that indeed appears to be the case. According to a new study by jumped up young dogs Ernest Ted CAC in 500 pages of densely argued and pretty prose, the wet behind the ears a little squirt pulls apart the pamphlet his pronouncements upon werewolves, demonstrating them to be complete drivel. Ah, you may cry. But what about all those footnotes? It's true that the mythical Island is one of Dobson's most heavily annotated works bulging with an apparatus of footnotes and references and scholarly appendices. So bulky did all this stuff make the first edition of the pamphlet, then, that when running off the first few copies in the shed, marigold, two broke her Gus stettner machine and had to call out a person from porlock to repair it. That's why the additional material was published as a separate pamphlet thereafter, the pair of pamphlet banged together into a cardboard box, too, which was stuck with glue and mezzotint of a werewolf done by the noted mezzotint East Rex tent. It is perhaps the most sought after Dobson Rarity coveted by collectors, which makes Ted cacs revelations all the more dispiriting what on earth kind of made Dobson deceive his readers so it is not a question Ted Kak tries to answer but then he's young and callow and has not yet gained a proper apprehension of man's fallen state. The fruit of the tree of knowledge is not a fruit. Ted cat has bitten yet. His time will come as it does to us all, as it certainly did to Dobson. Because the pimple youngster does not address Dobson's motives for churning out this greed of twaddle. We're forced to draw our own conclusions for what it's worth and despite the evidence pile up against him, I think it's legitimate to ask if Dobson actually believed the absurdities he wrote of werewolves. It will not be the first time he was subject to delusions, hallucinations, and General brainpan dislodgement. The Critic Bernard Levin wrote of Beatle person john lennon, that quote, there's nothing wrong with him that could not be cured by standing him upside down and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls out. Unquote. The same was true of Dobson, if not more, so. In fact, marigold Chu designed but never got around to building a sort of hoist of deal and wickiup and gutta percha, into which the pamphleteer could be pinned up ended and shaken about have such treatment been applied, perhaps on Thursday mornings before breakfast, Dobson might never have cast so ineradicable a blot upon his reputation as the mythical island where werewolves think they come from. So did he think it was true? Did he just willfully misread all those quotations and reference with which the pamphlet is packed.

Frank Key  10:01
The problem here is that he seems to invent have invented most of his sources, from ancient texts in Latin and Greek and Greek to scripts from films and radio plays. And a paragraph about werewolves apparently copied down from the back of a carton of breakfast cereal. tellingly, Dobson does not say what the cereal was. And in any case, the pamphlet was written at a time when we know he only ever ate bloaters for breakfast. Oh, it is a puzzle to be sure. a clue may be found by close reading of his earlier werewolf pamphlet, the hidden wealth of werewolves out of print, the one where he bangs on about werewolves living in caves were in a cap toads in hanging cages, the toads having jewels embedded in their heads. It all sounds a bit unlikely, doesn't it? Did he invent that to Ted CAC ignores this pamphlet completely? But then perhaps he's never heard of it? To gain a familiarity with the entire corpus of Dobson's work takes years and years, as I know, to my cost, and I have decades yet to leave God willing. Before I am as ancient and craggy and stooped and wisdom does Allah wishes nesting bird, the greatest Dobson, first of all, who is well into his second century, and has collected several free bus passes from the government. He sells the spare ones on a website called nesting bird by and spends the proceeds on gruul, which is all he's able to digest after long years of debauch. The point about the first werewolf pamphlet is that Dobson always denied having written it. He claimed it was a forgery wrought by sinister and shadowy associates of international woman of mystery Primrose dent. If this is indeed the case, it would be a fool who would dare to investigate further. Let us not forget that the last person to probe the doings of LaBelle dent a television reporter even more pimply and callow than Ted Kak was pinned up ended and shaken about in a hoist umpteen times more terrifying than marigold, choose unrealized design. I'm not joking. That's why I'm gonna stop talking about the whole confounded business and go for a walk down by the docks, where I may or may not be set upon by marauding werewolves. And if I am, it will be a fight far less horrifying than Primrose dense hoist.

After that piece appeared on the hooting yard website a letter arrived from a werewolf. It was rather difficult to read as the note paper on which it was written is soaked in blood and vestiges of an trail, but I did my best to decipher and transcribe it. Dear Mr. Key as a werewolf I feel I must take issue with your assertion that Dobson was wrong about me and my kind. I realize you were just echoing the witterings of young Ted CAC, but you've not subjected them to proper critical scrutiny and appear to believe every word of his tiresome book. Oh, and it may well be densely argued in the sense that we use dense as a synonym for thix Cupid or brain fuddled, but to describe his prose as pretty, is preposterous. The CAC book clunks along like some sort of leaden clockwork robot brim full of elephant tranquilizer? And don't start arguing with me that my analogy is flawed in that a chemical tranquilizer would have no effect upon a robot mechanics for I have actually stuffed the innards of a robot with mind numbing powders from sachets, and I know where have I right? The robots progress, clunking along the line towards the lab was just like Ted cacs prose in terms of its apprehension by the average werewolf. Not that I consider myself average. By the way, I'm just making a point. I inhabit a sphere far above and beyond the average werewolf. I am fantastic and magnificent. As you would know, Had you ever seen me in my sphere? It is in fact that sphere that I'm writing to you about for it's located on the island though werewolves, the existence of which both you and Ted Kak deny. It is a perfect sphere, constructed much like a bird's nest of matted fur and twigs and Duff and it's possible With breathing holes through which I snort, it hangs from a hook in my cave alongside my caged toads. This is where I stay between full moons reclining in my where hammock by turns whistling, puffing on accurate Lithuanian cigarettes, reading Pliny Herodotus and Jeanette Winterson and taking wanax. Occasionally, I might play with my toads, goading them until the precious stones embedded in their heads glow oh so brightly. It's a good thing to amass such wealth when one is a werewolf. For who knows when even we may be plunged into penury due to a credit crunch. outside my cave, the island my ancestral homeland is bathed in a perpetual milky light. I do not know why it's milky. There are of course other caves and other werewolves, those who have made it back here as I did by marauding around the docks until we were able to slink aboard a ship on the cover of night. I myself managed to skulk aboard a tugboat mod at the benighted seaside resort of Oh hooligans Wharf. As soon as it chugged away from shore, I went on the rampage, howling and slashing and sinking my fangs into anything that moved, most of the crew jumped into the sea rather than have their throat ripped out. So I was very soon in sole command. I seem to recall that the tugboat was called Manley Hopkins, blood and gore dripping from my leathery lips, I steered her out into the vast expanse of the ocean, following my guiding star. Just as the Magi followed a star to find the infant Jesus. So we werewolves have our own star up there in the heavens to bring us home? I have absolutely no idea how it works. But it does, you can rest assured on that point, the heartbeat is working out which of the myriad stars blazing in the firmament is the one you're meant to be following. Now handy where charts of the heavens have ever been drawn? Probably because, as a general rule, we werewolves are clumsy and cack handed with paint brushes and pencils. That's true even of me, despite my all round, General majesty. So I drifted about in Manley Hopkins for a few days and nights, gobbling up the cold vitals of the slaughtered crew when I became peckish and howling at sea birds to pass the time. Occasionally, I would fix a star with a gaze of my yellow eyes and mentally interrogated. Are you the West star that will guide me home to my island? I would ask. But the stars never answer. They just glitter silent in a chaotic universe.

Frank Key  17:59
I found my star. On the third or fourth night aboard the tugboat. Far from land, I noticed a flock of were guillemots disposed across to the sky such that they formed an arrow or directional pointing device, clearly leading me to a bright, tiny speck. I howled, and I set the engine chug on its last gallon of fuel and took the steering wheel in my clumsy paws. With the rising of the sun. I saw land on the horizon shrouded in sea mist. My heart pounded in my hairy lupine chest. It was the Ireland a werewolves and it was no myth. The island is as real as the rock or pebble kicked by Dr. Johnson on that memorable day when he kicked a rock or pebble to prove a point. And I kicked and bucked as I left intrepid and superb for boat to shore, Homer last. It is true that in the title of his pamphlet, Dobson calls my island mythical that in his text, he suggests that it's merely a hallucination within my brain and the brains of other werewolves. If that was So could I swing here in my where hammock? Could the walls of my cave drip with the blood of savaged were victims? Would that milky light illumine scenes of such fecund beauty the hollyhocks and rhododendrons and petunias, the furs and vectren watercress that limpid pools and the roaring waterfalls, the manicured lawns, the Golf Links the running track. Ah, the running track, you know, I think I'll put aside my plenty and stretch my legs. This island has many weasels and stoats and badges to which I can lay trace round and round The track round and round until I pounce upon them just pass the flagpole and rip them to bloody pieces howling Cali under the silver moon.

reading an item in The Guardian last week about tiny lethal phantasmal poison frogs. I was reminded of Dobson's pamphlet, my terrifying encounter with a tiny Liezel phantasmal poison frog out of print. It is by any measure one of his most exciting works guaranteed to have one panting for breath and to cause beads of sweat to break out upon the brow. This is Drew to the pamphleteer deploying, as he so rarely did his remarkable ability for building suspense. alerted by the title, we're in a state of heightened expectation for the appearance of the miniscule killer, so tiny yet so toxic, but Dobson is in no hurry to come face to face with the lethal frog. He begins by recounting in exasperating detail how in preparing for a morning trudge along the towpath of the old canal. He discovered that the aglets on his batavian crime busters boots had become rusted and brittle. The boot laces fraying as a result, reluctant to Don a different pair of boots, for reasons he enumerates over five pages. Dobson describes his search in drawers and cupboards and hidey holes for a replacement pair of boot laces throughout this desperate fossicking as he calls it, marigold Chu is staring out of the window at the incessant rainfall, picking out a tune on her Celeste, composing in her head, the words of the song that would later be known as The Ballad of incessant rainfall. In his monograph on Dobsons various items of footwear, Aloysius nesting bird asks why the pamphleteer did not simply remove the laces from one of his other pairs of boots and reuse them when it became obvious that he had no pristine boot laces to hand. He answers his own question by delving into Dobson's infamous pamphlet, every lace has its own boot, out of print, the work which plumbed in excruciating detail the unfathomable depths of the pamphleteers neurosis in these matters. Those of us who've read our nesting bird will have his commentary in the back of our mind, as we follow Dobson crashing about the house on his few tiles search 20 pages in we're no closer to our own encounter with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, but the tension is becoming unbearable. At the point where Dobson describes tipping out onto the floor the contents of a battered cardboard box kept under the kitchen sink. We're ready to put the pamphlet aside and to put the kettle on for a common cup of tea. Next we take a nap and when we return to the pamphlet, we find that is what Dobson did to giving up hope of finding new boot laces for his batavian crime busters boots and leaving marigold to clinking and musing and staring out of the window. The pamphleteer retires to his Nat pub. Now he cranks up the suspense by treating the reader to a detailed account of his period of unconsciousness, accompanied by masterly if somewhat florid descriptions of his pillows, his coverlet and his mattress. nesting bird has remarked that no one has ever written about the nap as brilliantly as Dobson. The only wonder is that he never devoted an entire pamphlet to the subject. This is uncharacteristically careless of nesting bird, who was overlooked the mid period pamphlet 50 pages of prose about daytime naps in theory and practice out of print. It's an inexplicable lapse on the part of the greatest of Dobson is one I'm minded to attribute to his habit in the later years of mulch, a mop cloth, Bish bash, fluffy, flapping. And so with put on tenterhooks, still awaiting the terrifying encounter with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, wondering if perhaps, when Dobson wakes from his nap, it will be to find the diminutive assassin perched within his Buffon, but no, he wakes, He grants, he stumbles to his esque wristwatch and begins scribbling. What we now come upon is not the fatal frog, but one of the central mysteries of Dobson is scholarship. This is what the pamphleteer tells us. I woke, I granted, I stumbled to my Esquire and they're upon scribbled 10 pages of mighty prose, putting the finishing touches to my pamphlet, six more lectures on fruit. The puzzle is that no such pamphlet exists. Given the importance within the canon of the original six lectures on fruit out of print.

Frank Key  25:18
It seems barely credible, but Dobson could have completed the sequel, I need to destroy it so utterly that Not a trace remains. As nesting bird has demonstrated, though, the pamphleteer writing innumerable fragments and scraps and unfinished doodles, whenever he considered a work complete, he invariably published it, including the stuff that can only be described as bollocks. That is nesting birds word, not mine. There is no other reference anywhere to this pamphlet, and in fact, marigold true in a light interview directly denied its existence. Everything Dobson had to say about fruit she said into a tape recorder is contained in the six lectures. The very idea that any further essays could have been wrung out of his brain is preposterous. He simply didn't know enough about fruit. As with all of marigold tues tape recorded pronouncements. This has the ring of truth, and it's backed up by the remarks of the pointy town fruit or as sick as Mondo fig or plum tree, who recalled that Dobson used to stand in front of his market stall fruit display, scratching his head and wearing an entirely vacant expression for hours upon end on many of market day morning, as if that were not evidence enough. We have the famous incident when the pamphleteer took part in a charity fruit quiz on the radio, and failed to answer a single question correctly.

Frank Key  26:49
My own theory about this perplexing mystery is that Dobson is deliberately pulling the wool over our eyes. by claiming to have written a pamphlet for which no credible evidence exists. He guesses rightly that our bafflement will be sufficient to make us forget all about the tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog, at least temporarily, so causing us greater terror and alarm when he reminded us about it a few pages later. It's an inspired display of narrative fireworks. Here is how he makes our hearts thump. Having pocked the final full stop on my majestic fruit sequel, I decided to go a trudging along the canal towpath in the incessant downpour. After all, I determined to wear my Latvian civic cavalry boots instead of the batavian crime busters boots for the latest in the form of work I knew in tip top condition. Earlier in the week, I had run them through a pneumatic boot lace testing contraption hired from humans. It was worth every penny that when the time came to return the machine to that most gorgeous of department stores. I admit I shed a few tears. I trundle this along the line atop my cart. I wondered if I would ever be able to afford to buy one of my own, then all my bootleg problems would vanish in the ether. Perhaps I thought as I rounded the sordid duck pond, if I could write a pamphlet that would outsell a pebble head paperback. I might. Oh, hang on, I'm forgetting myself, you will want to know about my terrifying encounter with a tiny little phantasmal poison frog. And just as life reflect art, if that's what it is, I'm now going to leave you in suspense for the rest of this story because we haven't got time to finish it this week. I've missed completely missed time myself. So that's the end of this week's show. Meaning that you're left in suspense, having to wait until next week to discover what happens when Dobson comes face to face with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog know treating by going to the hooting yard website and reading it for yourself. I'll be back next week. Bye bye
