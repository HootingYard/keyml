Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. And I've just swallowed a throat lozenge around the point of a throat lozenges to ease a sore throat. But somehow, in swallowing what was undissolved of the throat lozenge I seem to have made things even worse. So anyway, I will try and get through the next half hour or 28 minutes or so without collapsing in a coughing heap. But coughing heap coughing fit. But anyway, but enough of my tribulations. Dobson lived in the era before mobile phones, of course. So when he found himself in perils in an isolated spot, he had to harness every last scrap of ingenuity to summon help you arrive would simply make a call on our mobile? Well, you would, but I wouldn't, because I do not own a mobile phone, and I never shall, for they are an abomination unto me. And I'm not joking. Anyway, and but Dobson, well, this wasn't an option, even an option for Dobson. So what did he do? Let's take a look. See what I mean. Let us take a closer look at the circumstances. It was a Tuesday in February. football fans were grieving the loss of the Busby Babes in the Munich air disaster. Pope Pius the 12th declared that St. Clair was to be the patron saint of television, and little blind, but David Blunkett was just 11 years old. Meanwhile, Dobson got lost on an ill advised hiking expedition, and found himself exhausted in a spinny menaced by feral goats. The out of print pamphleteer had also managed to get himself hopelessly entangled in a thicket of thorny brambly, creeping greenery, rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles. That's the kind of spinny it was at least 20 miles from the nearest village, and with no path, no country lanes, leading anywhere close to it. There was it's true a big pile on a couple of dozen yards away. But it was a lone pylon unconnected to any kind of electrical grid or other wiring system, a pylon, the purpose of which was unknown. And it was a pile of rust suggestive of abandonment on this use. This was not the first time Dobson had been in a hiking pickle, and it would not be the last. Indeed late in life. He had enough material to furnish a pamphlet in titled an anthology of disastrous hiking mishaps, cobbled together from a lifetime of ill starred rustic pursuit out of print. What was significant about this particular hiking pickle was the manner in which Dobson succeeded in extricating himself from it. This was the period during which he had joined an experimental knitting circle. And as luck would have it, he had in his Nadi bag that day, his latest project, it was an interpretation in wall of the wreck of the Deutschland by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Dobson realized that when fully unwrapped Hold, the yarn would stretch for miles. He sat down in the brambles lit his pipe, took the scrunched up woolen masterpiece out of his Nadi bag and unraveled unraveled unraveled. Two hours later, he was still unraveling. The sun was setting by the time he was done, but Dobson had no fear of the night, for he was sanguine. I just like to interrupt here with the frequently asked question. Why didn't the pamphleteer use his portable metal Tapping Machine to call for help? Answer, he was unable to use his portable metal Tapping Machine because there was no ground level pneumatic hub within reach.

The wall fully unraveled Dobson tapped out his pipe on a stone and beckoned to one of the Federal toggenburg the goats were still gathered in a gang on the edge of the spinny and it's a mystery why they had not attacked the Bramble trapped pamphlet here. In the anthology, Dobson suggested that a combination of accurate pipe smoke unraveled Wolf and his sanguine nature had deterred the goat. But it seems that for once he was being modest. Almost certainly, the decisive factor was Dobson's eerie ability to mesmerize goats, especially toggenburg. It is a skill which has not been much remarked upon, possibly because Dobson himself made light of it, and Curiously, never devoted a pamphlet to it. But he had been practicing goat mesmerize ation since he was a baby in arms. And now his expertise paid off, beckoning a toggenburg as I said, Dobson tied one end of the length of wall around one of its satanic horns, then whisper the goat language into it here. We do not know what he said. But presumably it was something like scamper away goat in a straight line, and do not stop until you reach a village. It was not a village that the goat scampered to, however, three hours after being entranced it came to a wire fence, crude its way through, and in so doing set off a hideous caterwauling alarm system. That night was filled with noise, and the toggenburg was caught in the white glare of a CLI glide. Within seconds, it was surrounded by a clumping troupe of visored commandos armed with Simon and Garfunkel rifles, inadvertently the mesmerised Capricorn had stumbled into a top secret military intelligence compound. Come on commando with a captain's badge bundled the goat onto a book sight cradle trained to a winch, while a second Commando. This one with a cadet badge untied the wool from its horn. miles away. Dobson was smoking his pipe and lackadaisically paying out the wall hand over hand. Suddenly he felt it jerk and held on tight. And then he was yanked free of the thorny brambly, creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beagles, and dragged across a wasteland of fields and gravel pits and sumps and countryside filth, until he fetched up at the feet of the commando who reeled him in just as midnight struck. That he's out, Dobson got out of a hiking pickle, only to find himself in a very alarming dilemma indeed, slap bang in the middle of a military intelligence compound that was top secret for very good reasons. reasons which, even at a distance of 50 years, I am far too terrified to divulge. He was placed in a holding cell with a feral goat and interrogated at length. The Ward was returned to him, and he asked what and was given a pair of knitting needles. Between interrogations, he was able to reenact the wreck of the Deutschland. Although much of his woollen reimagining of the lines about the tall man was gnawed into scritti by the toggenburg. By the time the commandos released the pamphleteer, having scrambled his brain pans so thoroughly, that he remembered nothing after the spinny Richard mill house Nixon had published his book six crises, Pluto and Neptune Were in alignment for the first time in 403 years, and little blind David Blunkett was no longer so little. Dobson returned home even more sanguine than before the hiking pickle. As for the feral goat, it stayed with the commandos. They adopted it as a pet, and they call it Flopsy.

I wanted butter more than I wanted guns. I've always been partial to dairy products, cow's milk and yogurt, for example. But my greed for butter had become all consuming. I was mad for it and could think of a little else. So one grim, overcast morning, I set out for the nearest dairy, knocked at the gate, and demanded butter. The dairy man of great Balcon threatening mean, refused me butter and shooed me away, as he might shoo away a nap. Broken in spirit, I locked into a tavern, a CAD with a pencil moustache and a battered briefcase was propping up the bar. He asked what I owe me and I explained. Let me give you a tip. He said, I know about these things. The best way for you to obtain butter from that dairy man is to threaten him with a gun. If you went back and demanded butter while aiming at the center of his forehead, a fully loaded mannlicher carcano snipers rifle, I think you'd find he would hand over as much butter as you want in a jiffy. This was a persuasive argument. But I told the cab that I have neither Amanda carcano rifle nor any other type of gun. That's where you're in luck, he replied. For it just so happens that I'm an international arms dealer, and I can lay my hands on any type of gun you want at the drop of a hat. It will cost you of course, but think about the butter. I was won over and I scuttled home to fetch from under my bed, the shoe box containing my worldly wealth. It was not a great sum, but I hope it will be enough to buy a rifle. As I made my way back to the tavern, a little birdie. I think it might have been a p word or a grieb perched on my shoulder and chatted in my ear. What it said had I been able to translate it twittering was why don't you give the money directly to the dairy man as payment for his butter. But I was ignorant of the language of birds and I brushed it away without understanding. The CAD was still propping up the bar and he accepted my shoe box of cash after counting it carefully. Obviously he said as a gun runner I have to be cautious lately under the viaduct at nightfall and I will give you a fully loaded mannlicher carcano snipers rifle. But I want my butter before then I wailed. That's the whole point. I want butter before guns. The cat looked at me with some sympathy. Well, he said, why not go back to the dairy and explain to the dairy man but if he doesn't hand over his butter there and then you will come back after nightfall armed with a fully loaded manika calcolo snipers rifle and you will shoot him through the center of his forehead without mercy that hold him back his ideas up. Good idea, I said and I scampered off to the dairy happy and hopeful. I knocked at the gate and explained myself to the dairy man. I expected him at once to be cowed and to fetch butter for me. But instead he took from his pocket a handgun and shot me several times in the legs and arms. As I lay sprawled in the mud outside the berry gate, waiting for an ambulance to come clanging the P word or grieb landed on my head. began chattering into my ear. Before I passed out, I resolved to learn the language of birds.

I'd like to read you a letter that appeared in a recent issue of the weekly worker. I'm not a reader of the weekly worker myself, but I understand that it's the publication of something, I think it's called the communist Alliance. Anyway, it's a far left political group, our school and every week, like, come out with the weekly worker, and here's an extract from a letter that appeared in it a couple of weeks ago. I never claimed that the future of humanity may rest on the benefits of extra terrestrial reptiles. I refer to the reptilian control theory, which argues that for thousands of years, humanity has been controlled by a reptilian race, using their mixed reptile human genetic bloodlines who have oppressed and exploited humans, while claiming descent from the gods and the divine right to rule by bloodline. ancient and modern society is obsessed with reptilian serpent and dragon themes, possibly due to this heritage. Even the flag of Wales has a dragon on it. Most people have closed minds, depending on the issues mentioned the possibility of aliens secretly manipulating humanity behind the scenes and the shutters come down. Nice to know I think that the spirit of David Eccles lives on in the communist Alliance.

JOHN informs me that in fact, the correct pronunciation is David Ike. I always thought it was IQ. Anyway. icky hawaiki or anyway, he believes in lizards. And this is not about David. Ike ik. He went to an orchard with his chums and they stole a punnets worth of plums. Then they scampered off to their hideaway as the last light faded from the day. The sky grew dark, then darker black. They transferred the plums into the sack. Then they stumbled out of their hideaway tent and round the town in the night they went depositing plums from door to door. Mr. Sharif, that was against the law. For in that town plums had been banned, as elsewhere in that plum less land, according to the king's decree chim chim cheroo cheese Chim Chim cherry. The King looks just like Dick Van Dyke plumbers were a fruit he did not like. Why then you asked did he allow the orchard trees bow upon bow to sprout so many calls bad plums. Let us ask those little charms. But they've vanished in the night. Now they're completely out of sight, out of the hills and far away as dawn breaks on a brand new day, and townsfolk find plums on this stirpes they greet them with shrill cries and whoops and hide them quickly before King Klaus comes on his rounds from house to house. If he finds a plum is rough will wax Cause umpteen heart attacks. So hide your plums Well, folks of the town till human voices wake you and you drown.

I seem to have planned a distinct lack of sufficient material for this week. So I'm gonna have to improvise for the last 10 minutes of the show. But I'm sure we can work something out. First thing I'd like to mention, actually, is that I always listen in in the mornings, I always listen on a rival radio station to farming today. It's not 545 in the morning on BBC Radio four, and it's absolutely fascinating program, I feel I've learned much about farming. You never quite know what you're going to get a turned on the other day. And the first thing they said was, so let's talk about pig diarrhea, which is not really what you want to hear 545 in the morning, but that's what they were talking about. Anyway, and there was an expert on there the other day. And he asked a very pertinent question, which was, how do you find wheat? So think about that, and you might like to send in your answers to hooting dot com. If you know how do you find wheat? Please let me know because I would like to find out.

Frank Key  23:05
So I have solved the lack of material problem by accessing pretty much at random, the vast and all encompassing hooting yard archive. listener, regular listeners will know but in case there are any irregular listeners, hooting yd is a website as well as being a radio program. And it's a hooting yd.org. And if you go there, you can find literally millions of words. Some pictures too, but lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of words, stretching back to the very early years of the century. And so it shouldn't really be any problem for me to find things to read to you. And I just found this to read, which is the Diary of a flapper. On the 30th of January 1922 went out flapping wearing my cloth hat. I scraped loose dress and unbuckled galoshes thrilled to the hot new jazz sound. The hot new jazz sounds club, Smoke lots of cigarette with a long cigarette holder, drank cocktails, and then drove an automobile at high speed through the city streets while laughing my head off. One day, far in the future, I will be a toothless Crone slumped in an armchair surrounded by knitting and a cat. But even then, I shall not Buckle my galoshes. And I will always be able to look back and remember how I flapped Oh, how I flapped

And here's another diary entry. This is from the diary of William Taylor, a footman, foot man. And he wrote this on the 29th of January 1837. Had a lady to dinner here today. The lady's maid is taken very sick today. I suppose she has been eating too much or something of the kind. But she is very subject to sickness to sickness. Last summer, when we were coming home from Canterbury, she actually spewed all the way, a distance of 60 miles, or not less time than eight hours. The people stared as we pass through the towns and villages. She couldn't stop Even then, it amused me very much to see how the country people stood staring with their mouth half open and half shot to see her pumping over the side of the carriage, and me sitting by quite unconcerned, knowing a piece of cake, or some sandwiches, or something or other, as her sickness did not spoil my appetite. It was very bad for her, but I couldn't do her any good, as it was the motion of the carriage that caused her illness. I gave her something to drink every time we changed horses, but no sooner than it was down, it came up again. And so the road from Canterbury to London was pretty well perfumed with brandy, rum, shrub wine, and such stuff. She very soon recovered after she got home and was better for it after 11 o'clock, my fire is out, and I'm off to bed.

savera was standing by Norwegian roadside as smoke from a blazing consignment of Norwegian goat trees. deloading goatee Tz gusts. Luckily standing next to me was Cal been earned vinje of the Norwegian public roads administration. Tell me kelbyone Vinge, I shouted. Can you recall any previous occasions when cheese has caught fire on Norwegian roads? I did not catch his reply. But apparently the BBC News reporter did it BBC News reporter did. And apparently fires of burning trees on Norwegian roads are not uncommon. I think that will do for this week with only a couple of minutes left and it will soon be time for the next show. So in order for a nice changeover to take place, I will shut up. It's a repeat anyway. But still, you know there still needs to be a train driver. So anyway, that was holding out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. Even if the last 10 minutes were kind of made up as I went along, but even then that was interesting. flappers. William Taylor's Diary of a sick lady's made in a coach and treats fires in on Norwegian roads that you don't get that kind of thing in every radio show. Maybe you don't want to I don't know. Anyway, and I won't be here next week. So there'll be a repeat of an older program. But I'll be back the week after that. And I might even have enough new material to read to you then. Bye bye.
