Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank tea. This is hooting yard on the air. Who in yard on the air, like we like we heard gutters on pull the plug and this is in yard. in, in, in the yard on the air. And I'm going to read something to you now. And if you'd like to get a map of the City of London, in front of you, you can follow the progress of the story. You can trace you can trace the story on a map of the City of London. Should you so desire. So I'll give you a moment to acquire that map. Right I see me required your map of the City of London. The other day, I was walking through the city of London. And as I turned on to crutched friars I almost collided with a friar on crutches. Boy, Watch where you're going. He shouted. I do beg your pardon. I said for I'm always polite to friars. I'm afraid I was as so often lost in a dreamy haze of preoccupation. The friar steadied himself on his crackers and fixed me with a piercing gaze, as if we were preparing to excavate to my soul. With what were you preoccupied? He asked? his tone was abrupt. Oh, nothing significant. I said, Current Affairs, you know, turmoil. Ash died back. The ongoing saga of Jeremy Corbyn. You have your finger on the pulse. He said. I know nothing of these things. As a member of the order of the fratris crucify bury. My mind is pointed towards the initial ball. Away from the grubby world I asked, but he was already hoisting himself off down the street. Having nothing better to do, I turned about and followed him. There was something in that gaze that had dislodged my brain from its mundane concerns. Not being on crutches myself. I swiftly caught up with him. May I accompany you as you make your suffering progress along crutched friars? I asked. He spat on a flagstone in a very unfriendly way. And granted. I would like to know less about current affairs and more about the ineffable. I said, I can tell you nothing of the ineffable. But you do not already know in the innermost core of your being. He said, you might be more interested to know why I am on crutches. We turned left onto Lloyds Avenue. Well, I didn't want to pry. I said, he cackled. Why do people always say they're reluctant to pry into the affairs of crutched friars? He said, and without waiting for an answer, carried on by pry when they ought to pray, do you pray? Not often, I admitted. Though I had been known to raise my eyes to the heavens at times of emotional anguish. We were now on Fenchurch Street. I can see he said by looking at your legs that you have not suffered the emotional anguish of losing the use of your lower limbs and being forced to hold yourself along Fenchurch Street on crutches. Well, actually, I did lose the use of my lower limbs for several weeks when I was seven years old, I said and felt great emotional anguish commensurate with my youthfulness at the time. Ah, but did your butt Did you hobble in crushed through the city? He saw from my face that the answer was no, no. You lay a bed in the comfort of home. No doubt, fetched warm milk and biscuits by your mama. Indeed, so I said, may I ask them why you do not lie a bed in your friary fetched warm milk and biscuits by your friary equivalent of a mama because a crushed fryer cannot rest when he has urgent business to attend to. He shouted. We will now on Lombard Street. You cannot pray So pri he went on pri to find out why I am on crutches and why I am heading west are now very slightly Northwest through the city.

To be honest, I didn't much care. I still wanted to hear about the ineffable. But it seemed rude not to ask as he kept going on about his crutches. So I asked, Would you believe me? He said in reply, if I told you our friary has fallen victim to heathen Voodoo interlopers. I would if you furnish me with more detail, I said, they came one wild and windy night, he said, and they were cleverly designed as crap this another cleverly disguised as crutched friars. They said they came from one of our houses in Belgium or Bohemia, I forget which, somewhere beginning with B. We gave them porridge to eat and bales of straw on which the rest all seemed hunky dory, or as hunky dory as it ever gets in the friary. But soon enough, odd things started to happen, ordered unseemly things, things involving the ritual sacrifice of chickens, for example. Gosh, I said, with passed on to mansion houses straight. There was an eerie shenanigans with the blood of ducks to and pins in dollies eyeless, horrible Dolly's brother with bows heads swelled to the size of a medicine ball. Brother Sam weed raved like a madman, Brother nitti turned into a serpent, and I lost the use of my mother Lin's. It was Voodoo, I asked. That's my guess. And as a crutch. friar, I intend to fight fire with fire. Though I feel where heathens spell upon me. I hope it is not too late. But surely you're safe from them. And they're awful magic here in the sun dappled city's streets, I asked. Ha, he cried. Wood that it was so that power is hideous and terrible. It is not only I who fear there damageable tricks you have chosen to walk beside me. So you too, at any instant, could fall victim to their Voodoo. And as he spoke, we both turned into poultry.

Yeah, so I hope you were following that on a map of the City of London. And then you'll get the exciting read at the end. There was an autobiographical element to that story. It's I didn't ever actually walk along through the city streets with a crutch fryer. But I did, at the age of seven, lose the use of my limbs for several weeks and was laid up in bed and brought warm milk and biscuits by my mama. It was never ascertained. What actually happened. I just woke up one morning and was about to get out of bed and I just fell on the floor. So yes, interesting. I remember being quite melodramatic about it and wailing. Remember, I was seven. Oh my god, I'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. However, several weeks later, I was walking around again. Anyway, enough of what? Behold the socks of the mighty. These were the words I heard declaimed in my dreams, in the moment before waking on a windy winter's morning. It was later as I was scuffing breakfast, eggs, plus a surfeit of lampreys. Then I realized their significance. I slapped my forehead and went to retrieve from the cupboard under the sink, my battered tin crown, the time had come to stake my claim to the Iron Throne, I would rain, I would reign of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. First of all, of course, I would have to eliminate all the other pretenders to the throne, of whom there were many, oh, many so many. I had not thought that death hadn't done so many. But for all the corpses piled up along the pathway to the throne, there yet remained innumerable claimants who are very much alive, alive and in brutish, good health, and heavily armed and have psychotic temperament. If I was going to take my rightful place sitting on that thrown with my bobble and scepter I was going to have my work cut out. What I needed was a troop of minions, the presence of minions menza, kingly air even to the windiest of throne claimant straight after breakfast then I popped to the news agents to pick up the latest issue of the directory or register or whatever it is that invaluable publication, which lists in alphabetical order with contact details and accompanied by skillful line drawings with much cross hatching done in a spidery pen. All minions currently available for hire. Sitting on a municipal park bench, buffeted by the wild wind. I leafed through the lists and plumped for the minions of the pointy sticks are last on closer inspection. This turned out to be a knitting group composed of some wild and crazy folks. Quote, the last thing you wanted a minion is wildness or craziness. Rather what you're looking for is slavish devotion slobbering and a propensity for violence. Being armed with a pointy stick is a definite advantage, which is why I had been initially attracted to the knitting group. In the event, I picked some other minions from the directory and gave them as their first task, the foraging from forest of sticks, and the sharpening of those sticks until they were pointy. I accomplished all this while still sitting on the park bench. The wind, as I said was wild. Wild was the wind, and I heard the sound of mandolins the sound grew louder, and I realized that across the park on the other side of a swan mad or like, came the approaching forces of a pretender to the Iron Throne. It may have been Stannis Baratheon, or possibly bailong Greyjoy. whichever one it was, his army was strumming frantically on mandolins playing I think, listen, the snow is falling by Yoko Ono, which I recognized as the beside of Happy Christmas war is over. recorded with that beetle she married

her I thought to myself, or rather spoke aloud in a kingly way, knowing my minions would hang on my every word, whether it made any sense or not. This puny pretenders army sings of the snow falling windy it may be and while may be that wind, but snowfall there is not not here. As any fall no snow falls far north of here by the wall. Clearly the army is geographically obtuse and disorientated, they will be easy prey, particularly as they are armed only with stringed instruments. And then I issued a command to my minions, ordering them to rush at the pretenders nincompoop army and poke at them with their newly sharpened pointy sticks. Plus, was the same set from what history books would call the Battle of Bristol a municipal Park. We routed the enemy and I was one step closer to the Iron Throne. It was time for lunch. I headed off to a nearby stable tore the heart out of a living horse and gobbled it down while it was throbbing and hot and bloody. Unfortunately, there were no barbaric Dothraki present to witness this gustatory Feat. We're not all as media savvy as the Khaleesi, who had the cameras presence during her own horse heart eating lunch scenes. But I was not troubled by her far away in the red wastes with her grunting savages and baby dragons. Other claimants to the throne had to be dealt with first, not least Robb Stark It was at this point I realized the knitting group could be abused to me after all, who would dare to stop me I reasoned if I can bashing upon the city gates of King's Landing, wearing a pair of socks emblazoned with a knitted motif of the black bat of Heron Hall. Truly sour tired, would I walk in the socks of the mighty? So cheered was I bought this thought that I took my minions to the tavern for some celebrator cruising. It was only mid afternoon, but they had acquitted themselves well, and were deserving of reward. Little did I know that shortly before we fetched up at that smug rustic hostelry, the unreconstructed Stalinist creeping away. Sorry, little did I know that shortly before we fetched up at that snug rustic hospital room. The unrest unreconstructed Stalinist, creeping away from it in his asked like why was Peter Baelish, the Lannisters Machiavelli. He had dripped poison into the ear of the taverner and the taverner, in turn dripped poison into our flagons of Grog. By teatime, my minions lay sprawled in the sawdust, dead and dying, and I myself was so sick, I could barely bring myself to school for a second horse heart for dinner. But I forced it down and set off alone for the castle, were in the minions of the pointy sticks did their knitting. But in my weakened state, I became hopelessly lost. Last two is my memory of what happened. All I can remember, I remember is standing by the wall, the guns shot above our heads, and we kissed as though nothing could fall. Nothing could fall. Who was I kissing? Why a minion of the pointy sticks. A net woman who had rescued me from a ditch somewhere along the way, and had brought me to the wall. And it is here at the wall I have stayed, I no longer stake my claim to the Iron Throne. I'm happy here fighting off wolves and wildlings listening to the falling snow while my neck woman, the minion of the pointy sticks, knits me sock after sock after sock after sock, each emblazoned with a motif of the black bat of harrenhal. I am no king, but I trudge through snow deep in the socks. Sorry, I am no king, but I trudge through snow deep in the socks of the Mighty

dopson. The out of print pamphleteer was an intermittent diarist. At certain periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal. At other times, he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings and there are also whole stretches where he fell completely silent. At least as a diarist. Surprisingly, there has been as yet no attempt to marshal all the extant text into a published edition. Here, however, is Dobson's diary entry written 64 years ago to the day on the 15th of June 1953.

Cabbage stalks in swans blood for breakfast, then I went for a trudge along the towpath of the filthy ol canal. Stop to gaze at cows, the cows gazed back, spent untold hours slumped at my escrito or struggling with my pamphlet in progress, farming with knowns. The problem is I know little about farming, and even less about gnomes. Why then asked my enamorado marigold crew did I choose the topic in the first place, she fails to grasp the intricate workings of what I have decided to dub Dobson practice, a practice that itself might be the subject of a future pamphlet. When the time came to sharpen my pencil, I could not find the pencil sharpener. So instead, I picked up this week a copy of the listener and wrote a fascinating article about a buff breasted Sandpiper from a careful reading and rereading. I deduce that this is some sort of bird though what it's doing hanging around at a sewage works is beyond me. If I had wings and the power of flight I am by no means certain that I would choose to wallow in sewage when I could take wing and fly to a water know somewhere less noise some a noxious Actually, I know that the writer calls it a sewage farm rather than a sewage works. Perhaps this is a suitable type of farm for gnomes. I shall have to embark upon further research pig in it and PS for supper. And the the lesson article is as follows a buff breasted Sandpiper. I found myself at a large sewage farm in the Midlands one day last September, said r s are fitter in open air. I have been told that I might have the chance of seeing a buff breasted Sandpiper there I was lucky enough to find on arriving that two other bird workers have done all the hard work for me and located it among a party of other small waders I was able to spend some time watching this very distinctive small wading bird, which was only the 20th specimen of its kind that has been certainly known in the British Isles. It looks like a small read the female of the rough about the size of a common Sandpiper, with a markedly rounded head and shortage bill. The most noticeable thing about it was the beautiful golden bath color of the head and breast shining like a little beacon in the bright September sunshine. Indeed, the easiest way to pick it up again when you lost sight lost sight of it among the pharaohs. It was in a waterlogged plowed field was to look for that glowing yellow point. Other points about it, whether it had no white winged bar or patches on the rump or tail like so many small waders, but instead showed a flash of white on the underwing. I suppose the number of people in Britain who have ever heard of them buff breasted Sandpiper at all must be rather small. It is not surprising that it should be so little known. Because not only is it so rare in Britain, it breeds in some of the remotest parts of Arctic North America, where few birdwatchers have the good fortune to go. In fact, many burdens Susie asked in Canada and the United States would have been almost as glad to see the buff breasted Sandpiper eyeballs.

Who is the third who always walks beside you. When I count, there are only you and I together. But when I look ahead up the white road, there is always another one walking beside you. To me, it's note on these lines from the wasteland explains that they were stimulated by the account of one of the Antarctic expeditions. But the party of explorers of the extremity of their strength had the constant delusion that there was one more member than could actually be counted. The account was by Ernest Shackleton of the Imperial trans Antarctic expedition of 1914 to 1917. The Explorer was reluctant to speak of the extra man who quote during that long and wracking march of 36 hours over the unnamed mountains and glasses of South Georgia. It seemed to me unquote, joined him and his companions. It has long been believed that he it was an incorporeal being a spirit guide, summoned by Shackleton's brain through monotony, darkness, barren landscapes, isolation, cold injury, dehydration, hunger, fatigue, and fear. As Michael Shermer put it, in an article in the Scientific American, a similar delusion is said to have affected others including the transatlantic pilot and accidental baby killer Charles Lindbergh, who sent the presence of a ghostly copilot on his second on his solo flight. A recent discovery by boffins in Antarctica however, suggests that there actually was an extra man with Shackleton's party. A manuscript entitled, I wish Shackleton's extra man was found encased in ice on a strafe ice floe, somewhere between South Georgia and the Antarctic ice mass. It was so well preserved, that when thawed out, the ink was still not dry. Unfortunately, slapdash handling by an overeager boffin resulted in smudging rendering parts of the text illegible. What follows are passages from this historic document. Good evening, my name is smudged. You do not know me. You have never known me. You will never know me. If ever you trek with Adrian Husky across the great ice continent of the South, you might see me there. That's me up ahead of the rest of the group. trudging through the snow. That's me rolling behind, never quite catching up with the main party. That's me over to the side, left or right, just out of earshot. I'm always with you, but never quite with you, but I am no Figment. I am all too real. I first arrived in Antarctica in smudged the first man ever to set foot here. I was here before Scott before Amundson before Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. I was here when the world was young. I cannot remember quite how I found myself here. One minute I was lounging in a hammock in the daffodil strewn garden of smudged then I was out at sea on some kind of raft, and it was cold, and I shivered, and everything was white, the sky and the sea and the ice. I made landfall, the rascals crashed by pack ice. I headed for the interior. But soon enough, I was walking around in circles, my mind both numbed and unhinged by monotony, darkness, the barren landscape, isolation, cold injury, dehydration, hunger, fatigue and fear. I would have gone to pieces, but at the end of my tether, I was befriended by penguins, who took me to their colony nursed me back to health, on a diet of fish and our guy and a rigorous exercise regime of swimming and flapping my arms and legs. For years past and our white ice haze, and I was content. But one day I woke up and I was filled with a hankering for home. I longed for the daffodils strewn garden, the hammock, and suddenly memories came flooding back of Smudge and Captain nitti and the betting shop and smudge and the riotous parties up at the big house and crates of negus and smudge and bouquets of enormous genetically modified crocus's. I had to return. With tears in my eyes, tears which turned instantly to icicles, I bid farewell to my penguin friends and trudged away across the ice and snow.

It was weeks later, when I came across a group of explorers, I was no longer used to the company of men. So while I shadowed them, I kept my distance, always enough distance to avoid having to speak to explain myself to tell my story. What was there to tell, nothing of note ever happened here, time stops. I had no idea how many years have passed seven or 70 or 700. When the explorers were asleep in their tents, I crept closer and went rummaging in the stores laughter there so ages, the cases packed with monogrammed silver cutlery, backgammon boards, cigar cases, clothes, brushes, tins of button polish, and copies of the vicar of Wakefield. I confess I helped myself to certain items that never stole anything important. And then one day I went a bit too far ahead or fell too far behind. I cannot remember which, and the Explorer has vanished in the mist, and I never saw them again. But luckily this was the golden age of polar exploration. And soon enough, there was another raggle taggle band of Dowty chaps struggling with sledges and Huskies across the ice. I joined them too, in my just out of reach way, hoping if I followed them, we would arrive back at their ship, and I could spell away upon it and return it last smudged and daffodils. Yes, how incompetent were all these chaps that I ended up as I had begun going round and round in hopeless circles. I'm still here, lost in the ice, hankering for home, salty icicles dripping down my creeks. Tomorrow, I shall get a gun and shoot an albatross. And that's the end of this week's show. Hope you've enjoyed it. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
