Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. And I'm going to try and read to you for the next almost half an hour. And one of the difficulties that beset ust van dongle BRAC throughout his career as a so called suburban shaman, with the ruinous cost of insurance having been dragged through the court by appointed town quantity surveyor who claimed emotional distress, disfigurement and loss of earnings. After being entranced into a week long state of whirling ecstatic frenzy. Fandango Brack vowed never again to practice his mystic arts without being covered by insurance. His first approach was to a greasy insurance agent with an unfortunate Kalmyk of hair, who delivered and fast and seemed more intent on his executive desktop bonsai garden than on the urgency of the suburban shamans business. The next three people he consulted were by turns lost in wistfulness egg bound and unseemly, and one of them failed to provide van dongle Brack with a suitable chair in which to sit during their appointment. He was ushered into a seat that emitted pneumatic hisses and tilted and swiveled on tubular steel pistons. It was fun dongle BRAC thought the most unshaved manic chair in which he had ever tried to sit. he judged each of the three to be unsuitable. And then one evening in a tavern, the suburban shaman struck up a conversation with a mountebank, who was passing through pointy town on his way to receive side psychics, more gas board. firms and berries declar brim of his mountebank hat is resolved with half flesh half mascara at a certain angle, you could have mistaken him for the god bow. It was difficult to imagine that he had once been an actuary, but this was indeed the case. And he had maintained many friendships with past office colleagues in the insurance industry. listening attentively to van dongle brax plight, as the two of them sank pint after pint of diluted rosemary and hibiscus syrup on the tavern balcony. looking out over the filth strewn fields which stretched unbroken horizon, the mounted bank eventually took a card out of his pocket and handed it to the shaman. This is the man you need. He said. His premiums are ridiculously expensive. You may be alarmed by his taste in class on I enamelware. And never ever tried to make him laugh. But these things aside, he is fine on insurance matters you will find on the terrestrial globe. Fandango Brock was puzzled by this reference to a globe for in his belief system. The Earth was cylindrical tapered at one end and ineffably mysterious at the other. But he liked and trusted the mountebank whose pinsa like perspicuity so appealed him, as did the hat bring depth with ferns and berries. Look which the suburban shaman was an ape in the coming years. Six weeks later, after a particularly exhausting session of communal hysteria around a bonfire in one of those filthy fields, Van dongle Brack took the bus to Oh hooligans Wharf. He had the insurance man's card in his pocket and berries on the brim of his hat. The firm's he decided would have to wait at the time of which I write the Pierrot that Brian soaked how how had not yet collapsed. And it was in a booth at the far end, a mile or more out to see that the suburban shaman came face to face with Excuse me. At the time of which I ride, the parrot that Brian soaked hellhole had not yet collapsed. And it was in a booth at the far end, a mile or more out to see that the suburban shaman came face to face with john Claude una nugu.

It's a name you might know, especially if you're an aficionado of the kind of insurance man who spends his leisure time as a creative genius. Charles Ives, Wallace Stevens and Franz Kafka, spring to mind and john Claude Enugu can be added to their company. acerbic, battered, chippy grand beauty soaked, eerie, foolish grunting and hot to trot, john Claude una nugu with the self styled Grandmaster of the goofy and the mccobb. In these numerous paperbacks explored with forensic precision, the narrow territory where that which is goofy meets that which is mccobb. Sometimes in his work goofiness wins out. At other times, he favors the mccobb at its best, the two modes or registers or styles or styles or modes or registers or styles are inextricable melded and fused and joined and inextricably fused and melded in a joint moment of characteristically una new guru esque in in tracking Radek ability. It can be hard to see where the goofiness falls off and the macabre begins. Just as it can be hard to see where the macabre ends and the goofiness takes over. So inextricably fused are they in Udo new goo esque, Maryland. Now, you might be testing irritably that I'm repeating myself or at least writing in a peculiar way annoying and in elegant manner. In fact, that was a clever pastiche of una new good early style seemed to best effect in early trash like the macabre thing from goofy town, or the goofy people from the macabre village. Later in his career, he devised new tricks and quirks. And I'm not alone in thinking that no other writer has ever made such fantastic use of italicized block capitals and exclamation marks. One of the great pleasures of a middle period una new gu novel, such as the macabre yet goofy duck pond, is the manner in which each sentence is given equal weight, every single one ending in an exclamation mark. It is the only book I know which, when read aloud, demands to be shouted out at the top of one's voice from beginning to end. Much like Wallace Stevens and Charles Ives, but possibly not Franz Kafka, john Claude una nugu kept his working and creative lives separate. When devoting his time to insurance, he set up in his booth on the pier. It was a small, cramped booth of wood and canvas, with a tin roof which resounded under the rain, and as you know, it often rained in a hoodlums Wharf for that was how the gods had ordered things. It was teaming down on the debut strand dongle Brack disembarked from the bus and made his way through the ill starred streets to the pier. There were a number of booths and kiosks on the pier in those days, and the suburban shaman found himself distracted by all sorts of depraved enticements as he shuffled along, stopping carefully on the steep, stopping carefully on the roughing planks. He passed by Edna the squid woman, little severing the mystic badger, the astonishing food splattered Jesuit, Kim fat guru, the evil tattooist David ik David Blunkett bonkers Maisie and her scrunched up dish cloth, and the poopsie Clutterbuck sextet, who performed the latest news headlines in the form of madrigals. a gust came in from the west and blue van dongle blackberries off the brim of his hat into the churning see far out Halfway through the horizon, he could see the telltale silhouette of a tugboat. What he wondered? Was it going to tug out there? closer to shore, he saw dozens upon dozens of boys red and yellow and blue boys, each with its own chain.

Van Daan road BRAC had always loved the sound of trains clanking at sea, and he stopped a moment on his prompts along the pier to listen. But the faint planking he heard, was soon drowned out by the barking of a bedraggled twinkly twirly man in the doorway of a nearby booth, who was manipulating a source been on a bus ticket in remarkable ways. Such antics thought the shaman had what Roland Bart would call rissoles. Like almost everybody who uses the word, possibly including Roland Bart himself, he had no idea what it meant, but he was a shaman babbler of incantations, so why should he care? He tossed a coin at the feet of the twinkly twirly man told him that he admired his results and head it on inside his booth as fat raindrops pingan Pond on the tin roof, the Grandmaster of the goofy, and the macabre was bossing the ink on a freshly written insurance policy. That was neither goofy nor mccobb. It was, if anything, a piece of actuarial magic that the suburban shaman would have admired for its hallucinatory qualities. In john Kaduna, new goos suspiciously manicured hands insurance policies became the things of beauty if Vaughn dongle brax beliefs were true, there is no doubt that una new goos policies would have to be filed at the end of the earth that terminated inevitable mystery. blotting done, the insurance agent cracked open another bottle of grand beauty, his own credo allowed for a globular Earth rather than a cylindrical one. Though, privately he held that his globe was like his stories, both doofy and macabre. In that sense, he felt himself to be a realist and attitude, which had caused him no end of grief with the Oh hooligans Wharf, pier booth rental authority, which preferred to rent it booths and kiosks to the non reality based community. I mean, six or seven prancing paces away from the booth. Now, Van Daan will brag to saw himself as a realist, although for him, the real existed on an ethereal plane accessible only through whirling about round a bonfire while counting gibberish. But as he always liked to insist, it was very choreographed, whirling and absolutely specific gibberish. That was why a hapless goon like the litigious pointy town quantities via could not just whirl and babble without the guidance of a shaman. And that was why the shaman needed insurance cover. And that was why drew strand dongle Brack poked his head in through the entrance flap of the wooden canvas and tin booth on the pier and saw dot dot dot. Why did I resort to an ellipsis I did so partly in homage to make periodu the new GUI, where the texts of such novels as beyond the macabre yet goofy duck pondan actually have more ellipses than words. And partly because I wanted to go make a cup of tea before bringing this narrative to a close. JOHN Claude una new whose work both in fiction and insurance was fueled by grand beauty, but mine is dependent upon copious cups of tea. I make no apologies for this. It was Thomas de Quincey who said, tea, though ridiculed by those who are naturally caught in their nervous sensibilities will always be the favorite beverage of the intellectuals. Whether or not on an intellectual, is that futile or conjecture? But I suspect I have more chance of being one through regular tea intake than by bandying about the results word. Now that's quite enough. That is returned to that ellipsis drew strand dongle Brack poked his head into the booth and saw john Claudio nuvu the grant The master of the goofy and the macabre, sitting a little fold out camp table, swigging DRAM buey and ready to set him some hot to sell him some hot to trot insurance.

and.dot.do strand dongle back, poked his head into the booth and saw dot dot dot his doppelganger. for a split second, he thought he was looking into a mirror. The resemblance between the two was uncanny. Indeed, it was macabre. Was it also goofy? Why spat my tribes? Yes, it was. And what happened next was doofy is still an even more macabre for van Dongo BRAC went into the booth and closed the flat behind him. There were witnesses to this, including the bedraggled twinkly twirly man and David egg, and though they were not released their account painstakingly taken down by detective Captain card pans, Dowty squad of gumshoes were deemed reliable by the Oh, who runs wolf Constabulary, investigative Uber brains. So we must accept that there were two men inside the booth on that sopping wet Thursday afternoon. You had anyone ever emerged? Was it john Claude Enugu? Or was it just ran dongle Brack, it was neither or it was both it was we are forced to concede an entirely new being an entirely new kind of being. I know this may sound implausible to members of the reality based community. But let me ask you this. Is that any other way to explain that within days the Oh hooligans Wharf Chamber of Commerce. Excuse me. The Is there any other way to explain the fact that within days, the Oh hooligans Wharf Chamber of Commerce registered a new company, which offered shamanic Insurance Solutions to whom fees can be paid in the blood of ducks and the bones of sprays and in pointed sticks set of fire.

Morning timing, Enid woke from uneasy dreams with a sense of tremendous urgency related to potatoes. She was based in Winnipeg at the time, and that taken a room in a motel of undoubted seediness. I could not pinpoint to the reasons for my sense of breathless urgency on that grim Mark morning. She wrote many years later in her memoirs, all I knew was that potatoes had something to do with it. The heroic, young, adventurous, astute the motel breakfast, a bull when it peg style, eggs and dough platter, sneaking out of a side entrance to avoid the man with the twisted lip at the front desk. The city was still new to her, and she had yet to locate any of the potato related premises. She felt such a tremendous urgency to visit. She limped across the plaza to her rented booster car and threw off its tarpaulin in one elegant sweep.

Frank Key  19:13
Excuse me. Tiny Enid had been practicing her elegant, sweeping arm movements for some weeks, and the superb elegance with which she swept the tarpaulin off the booster car won her round of applause from a nearby line of patient pastry persons Queuing outside a pastry shop. Before revving up the engine of a booster car timing Enid tramped over to the queue. She wanted to find out. She wanted to find out if she would send send or have potato urgency here, so close to her motel. It was possible after all, that among the pastries sold by the pastry shop could be pastries with a potato filling with that urgency that cracked her awake a premonition that a winner peg based criminal mad person had poisoned the potato pastries. If so, it would make sense for me bang on the scene, rather than having to speed around the city last unnerved or not knowing quite what she was seeking, nor why. So many of the adventures of the tiny adventurous had begun from these moments of curious intuition. But it was still early in the day, and the pastry shop proprietor had not yet twisted the shutters, hence the cue. Tiny Enid was hopeless at small talk, and she was at a loss how to engage with the stealth clapping cue, which was so impressed with the elegance of her sweeping armed movements. She pulled us brightly black gold green crap crushed crepe hat down low, and pretended an interest in pebbles piled close to the pastry shop shutters. If our instincts were correct, she must be first into the shop with the shutter when the shutters went up before poor innocent when a pet guide was felled by a poisonous potato pastry pie. Tiny Enid was a girl of impeccable manners and be flushed with shame and anticipation of having to push aside the unkempt hobble the boy who was first in the queue, and they looked at as if he had not eaten for a month. mockery as the pastry shop proprietor appeared with a hook on the end of a wooden pole, with which by some shenanigans he hoisted the shutters there was a distraction over by the statue of prominent winnipeggers Elias Conklin, who had been the city's mayor in 1881, a swarm of killer bees appeared out of the blue and set upon a defenseless old woman wearing her widow's weed. But man mast buzzing of the bees was nauseatingly loud, and the reaction of the pastry shop q was instantaneous. Even the starving hobble the boy forgot his grumbling belly. As the lion broke up, sprinting over to the Conklin statue, flailing impromptu be scarifiers are tiny heroin took the opportunity to sneak into the pastry shop. Something the proprietor in the gut with a girly bludgeon. She incapacitated him with a feed kicks to the head, swiftly located behind the counter every single piping hot pastry with a potato ingredient and stuffed a lot of them into a canvas sack. She dragged the sack over to her rented booster car tracted into the boot and sped away just in time for the killer bees had been confounded the widow woman was safe. And the patient pastry people were heading back to the pastry shop with coinage clutched in their fists. an hour or so later, having dumped the canvas sack of potato pastries into the river perhaps the most significant geographical feature of Winnipeg, and certainly the favorite of its populace. According to all surveys, at least those conducted by reputable polling organizations. The forks were the Red River meets the assiniboine and then driven around until she found a verdant Parkland tiny Enid slumped onto a traffic onto a tuffet dusted off or sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat and lit one of her high tar Uruguayan cigarettes. Soon she knew she would have to hunt down the criminal mad person and bashed them about. But for now, the world could take a pause and she could sit on her tablet and smoke and watch the Coots and more hands for whom

Yesterday I was going to use it in a show forgot to do so. And then I used it what three times, possibly even four, which is kind of goofy and macabre. Bye bye.
