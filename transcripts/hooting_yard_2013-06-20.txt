Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. And we're going to begin this week with a couple of paragraphs from Boswell's life of Johnson. It seems Johnson had been frequently observed at the club to put into his pocket, the Seville oranges, after he had squeezed the juice of them into the drink he made himself both clerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and seem to think that he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered. We could not divine what he did with them. And this was the bold question to be put. I saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night, some fresh orange peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. Oh, sir, said I, I now partly see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the club. Johnson, I have a great love for them, Boswell and pricer what do you do with them? you scrape them? It seems very neatly. And what next? Johnson I let them dry, sir. Boswell. And what next? Johnson nicer you shall know their fate, no further. Balls. Well, then the world must be left in the dark. It must be said assuming a mock solemnity he scraped them and let them dry. But what he did with them next. He never could be prevailed upon towel. Johnson nicer you should say it more emphatically. He could not be prevailed upon even by his dearest friends to tell.

So Dr. Johnson collected orange peel for no apparent purpose and no one knows why. I let her props onto the mat from Tim thurn oe Mr. Key you seem to know an immense amount about birds, yet virtually nothing about fish. Is there any reason for this disparity? If so, i Magog to know a gaag I tell you passionately yours, Tim thurn. Often with Tim's letters, I find the best thing to do is to ball them up in my fist, scrunch them a few times, and then deposit them in the wastepaper basket. Occasionally after the scrunching I drop them directly down or waste shoot. If, for example, the wastepaper basket is overflowing, as it sometimes is, or even if space remains in the wastepaper basket, I feel impelled to cast the letter as far from me as possible to obliterate it from my side. There's always the possibility you see that if I put the scrunch letter into the wastepaper basket, I might while it languishes there, hike it out and unstructured and unball it up, if that's a phrase and reread it. Once it's plunged down a white chute. It's gone forever, of course, or at least it retrieval is made a matter of great complexity, necessitating the involvement of various municipal waste management personnel who may or may not demand bribes or other favors in order to send one of their number or some kind of scuffling robot down into the middle to rummage for Tim's scrunched letter. Usually when I discovered Tim's letters so promptly, it's because they're annoying. He can be a very exasperating correspondent. And I think he takes a curious pride in being so I may be wrong on that point, but I don't think I am. Some people gain a great deal of pleasure from being annoying. And Tim is one of them. I believe he sits there, wherever it is, he lives picturing in his mind's eye me, huffing and puffing, balling up and then scrunching his latest letter, tossing it into our wastepaper basket or down our waist chute, and then going to have a lie down in a darkened room to recover from the mental disturbances caused me I, in my turn, lie there in the dark, picturing in my mind's eye Tim thurn, chuckling or chortling, or even guffawing fatuously as he imagines my irritation. I impute vacuity to his laughter because this makes it more vivid and hateful. Having no idea what Tim looks like I have to rely on my imagination. Sometimes he's as thin as a rake, angular and seedy with unseemly stains on his clothing. At other times, he's a Tabby kind of fellow smug and Goofy and seedy with unseemly stains on his clothing. Once I was so damn livid after reading one of his letters, that I decided to consult a graphologist who could from Tim's handwriting, fashola convincing portrayed often the possession of which would help me visualize is despicable. chuckling chortling guffawing vacuity all the more vividly. Unfortunately, Kim confounded me by typing his letters, which rather paid to my plan. It would be wrong, however, to think that all of Tim's missives are equally annoying. Some of them are not annoying at all. Those ones I do not boil up and scrunch and dispose of, but instead layout flat upon the bluffing pad upon my desk, and I reread them carefully while composing in my head a reply. Such was the case with the one cited above, regarding birds and fish. It was an unexceptionable vaguely polite query, and I thought it deserving of a civil response. Of course, I didn't want to give anything away. I don't want Tim thurn or anybody else for that matter, peering into the innards of my head to see what lurks within whether or not I know the first thing about birds or fish is my business, and nobody else's. So though it called for a polite response, I could not answer Tim's question directly. I would have to craft my reply as carefully as I read and reread his letter that is very carefully indeed.

Frank Key  08:31
Eventually, fueled by a slurp of Dr. Baxter's invigorating brain syrup. I worked out precisely what to write. First, though, I called on my priest to ascertain how many years I would have to languish in purgatory, were I to be less than truthful, or, to put it bluntly, to tell a bear face to lie, apprised of this information, which seemed not too onerous, I wrote. Dear Mr. thurn, thank you for your delightful and not at all annoying letter. I'm afraid that somewhere on its journey between your postbox and my doormat, it was Nord and nibbled by squirrels or some such small skittering mammals, and much of the content destroyed or rendered illegible. The only surviving text is, quote, an immense amount about birds on quote, and, quote, I am a gogue to know unquote. Muy Thai suggests that grammatically it would be better to place those phrases in reverse order, I am agog to know an immense amount about bird that being so I would happily bombard you with whatever it is you wish to learn about, for example, Swift's and swallows and geese and starlings and linnets and partridges and quail. woodpeckers and tail and praten coals, and thrashes and warblers and orcs and guillemots and shearwaters, and spoon bills, and skewers and albatrosses and swans and pigeons, and owls and penguins, and rooks and crows, and Deluxe, and puppet, and ostriches and categories, and grebes and divers and cranes and ygritte and sandpipers and cuckoos and parrots and waders and gold and nice jars and cockatoos and budgerigars and petrels and full miles and bitterns, and herons and more hens and pelicans and kestrels and cormorants. Especially cormorants, and hobbies and kites, and rails, and eagles and bus stars and corncrakes and P hens and clovers and lapwings and rye necks and curlews and turns and doves and grouse, and razorbills and parakeet and hummingbirds and Rennes and magpies and jack doors and add a push chickens. Let me know in a bit more detail which birds are of particular interest to you. Yours carefully. Mr. Key

I met my antagonist in vegetation and in all the vegetation was a patch of scrub and golf and Bracken and furs and flocks and loot pins and stunted hollyhocks behind the towpath that goes along beside the canal leading to the sea, which in turn leads on to all the major oceans Indian Atlantic, per se fake I calm re man by the names of the others offhand. I was in or because my antagonist to was in or, and or has a way of feeding off itself and increasing exponentially. We made a handshake last for hours. The stunting of the hollyhocks look natural organic or so it seemed to me, they did not appear to have been pollarded like the willows by the canal, just before the level crossing, the patch of vegetation was equidistant, I would guess, from the level crossing along the canal in one direction and the see in the other. I could draw you a map if you wanted me to. I do not think I would have been able to then in the immediate aftermath of our meeting. My antagonist, you see, had a very firm handshake. intimidatingly So, and I was not to be intimidated, so I grasped his hand all the more firmly. I think we were bent on crushing each other's bones. Neither of us was willing to relinquish the hand of the other. That's why we stood there, in vegetation and in or, like a pair of ninnies shaking hands for hours. I had come from the level crossing he from the sea. His shoes and trouser cuffs was still wet. It was a humid day. The stunted hollyhocks drooped, the air was sick with flies. In the distance, we could hear the sound of violins. I remember the sense of or as if it were yesterday, though, actually, it was the day before yesterday. I wanted to smoke and I managed to extricate a cigarette from the packet in my pocket and put it between my lips and take my lighter and ignite the cigarette with deft movements of my left hand. My right was still clutching the right hand of my antagonist in that long, long handshake. For a moment, I thought he was going to mirror my actions, for he put his left hand in his pocket, but when he took it out, he was holding a boiled sweet Deaf design, he unwrapped it from its twisted cellophane wrapper and popped it into his mouth with his left hand. He left for the wrapper, and it landed upon a looping. I was disconcerted. I had not had my antagonist down as a litter bug. He took advantage of my momentary disconcert meant to tighten his grip on my hand, I passed a mouthful of smoke into his face. He blinked once or twice but marshaled himself, but his grip relaxed, just a little. We both adjusted our footing me in my Tyrolean postman's boots, and he and his wet shoes and socks. I think they were quite expensive shoes, though I'm no great Judge of these matters. I suppose when one lives by the sea, one has to pay attention to one's footwear. Neither of us said a word. What would have been the point we spoke in different tongues, mind that of the interior his like Beau Brummell speaking French, that of those accustomed to chewing pebbles, and talking next to the sea. Without a pebble he may do with his boiled sweet, even if we had shared a language we were to austrac to speak, and as our or grew, so too did our antagonism with either of us claim victory.

Frank Key  16:36
I do not know how many hours had passed when the referee emerged from somewhere behind the clumps of scrub and Goss and Bracken and furs and flocks and lupins and stunted hollyhocks. he flicked his ribbon at our hand still clenched in handshake, and pronounced it a tie. We would have to return to the same place at the same time next week. He hinted that there might be television crews, eager to cover our confrontation. Our seconds appeared and Boris home on pylon Keens meter the chalet by the level crossing heater the sea, the sea. He took my cigarette bath as a memento and I pocketed his boiled sweet wrapper. At sunset, the patch of vegetation was deserted and undisturbed as if we'd never fought there at all. As if the whole thing had been battered dream.

Frank Key  20:53
If you want any. I can't imagine that you would need any possible further information. But if you do, go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org and look for children of Brian, Brian in inverted commas. And you'll find a link to tell you more about that important information. And speaking of Brian's Another thing you will say on the hooting yard website is a great old magazine advert from circa 1973 or 1974 which shows Brian ino doing what he does best, which apparently is advertising cat food. Highly amusing, anyway, onwards with something else. For me, the highlight of the recent old scratchy black and white newsreel footage of tiny fascist Film Festival was the exceedingly rare, old scratchy black and white newsreel footage of tiny Enid. The plucky fascist talk was filmed, possibly in the old town of Plovdiv, clumping along a street in a polka dot dress, dragging behind her her clubfoot and withered leg. This latter detail allows us to date the footage fairly precisely. In her memoirs, written in her dotage, tiny Enid recalled what she dubbed the year of rotating withers. And I quote, then it so happened that I woke one morning to discover that my left leg the one which ends in a perfectly normal as opposed to a club foot was withered. Being a brave and plucky tot, I did not whimper as so many girlies would have done, but dragged myself downstairs and tucked into my breakfast, milk slops. After which I got on with my day as usual. The next day, Tuesday, my leg was still weathered. But when I woke up on Wednesday, my left leg was a sand as before, but my left arm was weathered. This weathering lasted for three days, until the Saturday morning, when it was my right arm that was withered while my left arm was Holy unweathered come Sunday, my right arm was back to normal, but my right leg was withered. And so it went home, turn and turn about limb by limb. Only one was ever withered at a time, but invariably, one of the four, either an arm or a leg was withered every day. Of course, I coped admirably with these witterings and never uttered a word of complaint. But I did wonder if I might ever return to being fully sound the limb permanently apart, of course, from my clubfoot. It occurred to me that the under weathering of one and the weathering of another must of necessity take place while I slept. For it was a discovery I made each morning when the alarm clock jangled me awake at six. I just decided to forego sleep, and kept myself awake by singing rousing songs and smashing crockery, however, even as plucky are taught, as I could only remain awake for so long before, as a poet might put it, the waters of leaves closed over my head. When I woke up, my right leg, which had been withered was unweathered and my left leg, which had been unweathered was withered. Eventually, or not before time, I decided to consult a physician. There was newly arrived in town, a doctor with these splendidly appropriate name aq palsy. I wrapped my knuckles on his door was ushered in. And he took one look at me and announced in his gravelly voice that I was suffering from rotating withers. This was not a malady I had ever heard of before, obviously, or I would have been able to diagnose it myself. Dr. Au palsy proved to be an experimentalist. He was working at that time with an entirely new type of gas, which he had either discovered or invented, it was never clear to me which he prescribed the series of daily gas baths. The basic idea was that I filled the tub with piping hot water, pump some of his gas into it, and then splashed about playing with my toy ducks for half an hour.

Frank Key  25:56
A week of this regime, he said, and each of my four limbs would be free from withering for the foreseeable future. I am pleased to report that this experimental treatment proved highly efficacious. And at the end of the week, I was completely cured of rotating winners. He did not warn me of the side effect of his new gas, which made me three times as plucky and four times as reckless and five times as fascistic as I had been before. So that was an added boon.

Frank Key  26:52
That's nearly all we have time for this week. But I thought I'd end with this brief appendix to an 1870 book called on the writing of the insane by three Mackenzie bacon, which is a book about the writing of the insane. And Dr. Bacon says, in the position I occupy, I receive a good many letters from the poorer class. And I've often had from some of my correspondence, very odd specimens. The three following which you can consult via the hooting yard website, from individuals belonging to what is called the same portion of the public. In one, the contrast between the style and those in the preceding pages by certifiably lunatics, is perhaps not so well marked, as one would like to expect. So there you go. Poor people write like mad people. I don't know it's political incorrectness, gone mad. On the other hand, it was 1870. That's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope it wasn't too horrifying when I attempted to do a impersonation of Robert Wyatt. But you know, you should try these things occasionally. Yeah, and that's it. Bye bye.
