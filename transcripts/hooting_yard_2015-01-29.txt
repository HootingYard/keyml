Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting out on the air. I'd like to read out something for you now it's on a laminated sheet of a4 in front of me, and it says, Please read out on air, exclamation mark. And it's all in block capitals. So I suppose I should really shout it but I won't. resonance 104 point four FM's annual fundraising week starts from the fifth from the ninth of February until the 15th. I don't like the way that is phrased. It starts on the ninth of February, and it goes on until the 15th of February. With the funds, we aim to trial, dabble d a b service, overhaul our website and increase the range of our FM broadcast beyond central London. details of the fundraiser events and listings for our annual auction can be found@fundraiser.resonance.fm. That doesn't sound right to me as an address

Unknown Speaker  02:52
is it is it is I thought it should have had a comma on the end, but it's not I actually went there and that's how it is.

Frank Key  02:59
Oh, okay, sorry. fundraiser.resonance.fm. Go there. Now, when you finish listening to hooting yard, and you can find out all about the very many excitements jus in the next in two weeks time. Right fundraising. In the long ago, I was a quiet and well behaved child, and I really got into trouble. There was one occasion However, when I call something of a hoo ha at my primary school. I didn't think then, nor do I think now that I did anything wrong. But I was reprimanded, and my mother was called to take me home. And for the remainder of my time at that school, I was considered a bad egg. The burning sense of injustice I felt half a century ago, has stayed with me. And it's fair to say that it's cast a pall over my life. It so happened that one wet afternoon our teacher Mrs. screech, I think she was related to M A screech, the editor of many Penguin Classics, and author of laughter the foot of the cross. And our teacher Mrs. screech, asked the class to talk about our pets. One by one my little school mates stood up and said things like, I've got a cat named tittles, or I've got a dog called scamp. He is a colleague. When it was my turn, I stood up took a matchbox out of my pocket and said I have brought my pet with me. He is a pest Meyer and his name is Galahad and I opened the maxbox and let gala has skitter about on my desk. For this innocent act, I was reprimanded and taken home Ever After seen as a bad egg and a trouble mica on a record record boy. I was told that the word pismo was unseemly. And that was frightening the other children by letting a creepy crawly loose in the classroom, there were other offenses. Apparently a long list of them all bound up in that single incident. But Galahad was my pet and he was a pice Maya. I cannot recall when I discovered that peice Maya was an archaic term for and, but as soon as I heard it, I knew it was suitable for Galahad. He was fully deserving of two syllables. He was a valiant little ant, and a loyal one. Every night before I went to bed, I would take him out of the matchbox and put him in the garden so he could run about with all the other rants. And when I went to collect him in the morning, he was always there, with his teeming hundreds or even thousands of fellows, and I would pick him up and put him in his matchbox and plop it into my pocket. It may be that Galahad was not precisely the same amount every day, though it was hard to tell. And I tried not to bother my little head about it. If he was the same, and as I like to think then he's extraordinarily long lived for an end, as I still have him in a match box in my pocket as I write these words 50 years after the burning injustice, which has cast a pall over my life. It's a poor, lonely, lifted but Galahad himself. During our long and intense conversations conducted in the language of ants, punctuated by screeching, he offers me solace and consolation. He is my piss Meyer pal.

Frank Key  07:19
News. JOHN has just informed me that Galahad was almost certainly a female and peice Maya, because most ants are and the males apparently live underground and barely ever come out. So I didn't know that you see you learn something new every day. I'd like to just give you a quotation now very brief quotation from Sylvester dagger wood. I'm not entirely sure who he was. But in 1795, he wrote, my father was an eminent button maker, but I had a soul above buttons, and panted for a liberal profession. A soul above buttons, which of us can say that? Anyway, some time ago that many of you will know that I would write a weekly column for the dabbler website. And elsewhere in the dabbler, Brit, who is the editor of the dabbler writes a fortnightly diary. And quite some time ago now in his diary, he wrote about chickens. And this is what he wrote. Do you ever worry about the scale of cooking slaughter in the world? Sometimes as the contemplating a pack of six chicken size, for example, I think, well that's three chickens that have laid down their meager little lives right there. And there are so many packs on the shelves, and so many asters in the country, not to mention tescos and the rest. Then think of all the KFC is across the globe, dishing out bucketfuls of legs and wings 24 seven. And of course, we cannot exclude My beloved Nando's role in this unimaginable daily massacre. best not to think about it really, he concludes. But I have been thinking about it for 18 months now. Not continuously to the exclusion of any other thought in my bonds. But every now and then every now and then. And whenever I think about it, I find myself myself thinking what if the chickens were in college? Imagine that a phenomenon beloved of sci fi writers occurred. Alan miasma gas sweeping across the globe or be federally magnetic reversal and the result was empowerment of chickens. Perhaps their brains will be transformed and they would become hyper intelligent or more terrifyingly, they would remain just as stupid as Verner Hertzog thinks they are. But groter monstrous size, then they would wreak their revenge upon humanity. The unimaginable daily slaughter of chickens at the hands of humankind would become the unimaginable daily slaughter of humans, the talents of cooking kind. Such a scenario is equally horrifying if we imagine a reversal of our size relative to any small creature, particularly the so called cute ones. Look carefully a squirrel. Now, ponder how things would be if you were the size of the squirrel, and the squirrel the size of you. Do you honestly think it would toss peanuts in your path for you to squirrel away? This is the stuff of nightmares of fat airport bookstore bestsellers, and interminable blockbuster film franchises. reversed Revenge of the chickens for or squirrel Holocaust seven. Perhaps British right? And it really is best not to think about it.

Frank Key  11:59
I mean, imagine humans or you know, human reversals, size reversal with not only squirrels or, or chickens, but ant, we were talking about ants earlier or piss miles. Imagine they were the size of you and you were the size of them. Then

Unknown Speaker  12:21
there was a film in those days about a giant No,

Frank Key  12:25
that's true. Yes. Yes. So it all fits together. all fits together. And john is full of Do you think you seem to know a lot of that and

Unknown Speaker  12:39
when I was about eight, I love it. I was very interested in dance. And I used to get books about ants out from the library and that sort of stuff. So it's stuck in my head. Obviously it has on personally as well, but it didn't stop me from stamping on

Frank Key  12:57
them. But I would die. They would have done the same to you. Yeah. Moving on from chickens and squirrels on ants. And putting yard has been on the air now for nearly 11 years. And it's been a presence on what Tony Blair and I like to call the information superhighway for longer than that for about 14 no 13 years, 12 years, something like that. It's interesting thought that the website has existed for a longer period of time than that required by a Jesuit to completely brainwash a child. And this startling fact prompted two thoughts. First, I'm minded to add a slogan to the red rectangle at the top of the website saying dispensing pros to hoi polloi since 2003. Yeah, 12 years. The other thing is that when when my brain empties out, and I can't think of anything to write, I could just, I've got such a vast archive. No one remembers all the stuff I've written Least of all me. And so I can just dig out very old things. For example, the other day I posted a piece that I'd originally posted in January 2005. Very long ago. Anyway, it's called first spruce, now rusty and squalid. Consider that for one day you're Spry, preening and spruce, then knocked sideways cast down, become rusty and squalid. How does it help? happen. Is there a moment a split second, when gauntness turns to sackcloth and ashes? What would your journal read? 11am Oh, such bliss and splendor How blessed Am I to be among the animate and quick 11:01am Desert harbor a wreck as miserable as I want who crumbles in despair and is fit only to sliver in the muck with the worms. How are we to make sense of subject catastrophic change? crystal balls may help Sears and soothsayers see into the future. But is it true with some say that we can make sense of the present by staring long and intently with our eyes wide open at the surface of a muddy pond over by ball just spinny and not any of the ponds? They're just one the most brackish of the pond, the one which is inky black and fathomless. What will we see on the surface of that pond? If we stare at it long enough? I will tell you ignore the flies and mosquitoes and the mutant tadpoles that occasionally disturb the water. And sooner or later, you will be able to discern dimly at first, but with increasing clarity, the incredible face of the psycho pond dweller, shimmering, gaunt, bewitched and bewitching and its expression will reveal to you the meaning of neither past nor future, but of the present moment, radical decisive, and like the cockles and mussels in the old song alive alive. Oh.

Frank Key  17:17
Here's a story for children. Once upon a time, there were three little bunny rabbits. Their names were Flopsy, mopsy, and Satan. Flopsy and mopsy were completely normal bunny rabbits, but Satan votre all outward appearance. He too was a normal bunny rabbit, was in fact, the devil incarnate, incarnate in the form of a little bunny rabbit. confident in his overwhelming power to wreak havoc and destruction upon the earth. Satan was playing a long game, biding his time, gambling in the meadow with Flopsy and mopsy, and doing nothing to let slip his true identity. It so happened that one day there came clopping by the meadow, the itinerant Jesuit father Ninian tongue lash astride his elegant horse, now, wondrously the disposition of the buttercups splattered across the meadow match precisely the disposition of the stars in their constellations in the sky. It was as if the meadow was a mirror image of the night sky, or vice versa. I know nothing of astronomy, so cannot tell you which particular constellations were reproduced by buttercups on the sublunary sphere. But father Ninian tongue rash knew all about astronomy, for like all Jesuit, he was an intellectual and knew everything there is to know about everything, everything that is except the ineffable mystery of Christ our Lord, and even of that eternal enigma. He knew more than most. So as he came cropping past the meadow, he could not help but notice the remarkable disposition of the buttercups and he tugged on the reins of his horse, brought it to a halt and dismounted. Wait here a while Keith, he said, popping a Sugar Lump into the horses enormous mouth. There is something I must investigate. Flopsy, mopsy, and Satan Meanwhile, what gambling about on the far side of the meadow, thoroughly engrossed in whatever unimaginable vacuity in grosses little bunny rabbits. This was true even if Satan for he had gone native as it were, while waiting for the best for the time best suited to unleashing pandemonium upon the world. Not one of the little bunny rabbits paid the least attention to the gold figure of father Ninian tank slash stalking. Across the meadow, sprinkling each individual Buttercup with holy water for purposes only a Jesuit could understand. But as he came closer, they're very air shuddered. The Jesuit sensed the presence of evil, and Satan sent the presence of rigorous intellectual Roman Catholicism. Father Ninian Tang lash looked wildly about him, trying to pinpoint the source of all it was foul and unholy. But Satan knew his enemy immediately. He ceased to gamble and fix the Jesuit with a piercing gaze of unalloyed hatred. at this critical point, Flopsy and mopsy gamblings were so frisky that they collided with the priest spindly legs, and in his valiant efforts not to stamp them under foot. He toppled over. And then there was a thunderclap. sudden rain poured down in Torrance. Keith the horse swallowed the last of his rapidly dissolving Sugar Lump Flopsy and mopsy gambled away, and with his head resting on the grass, Father Ninian tongue rash gazed into the eyes of Satan, and Satan gazed back. strange to think that this otherwise ordinary wet afternoon in Mark could have witnessed the most decisive event in human history. Armageddon could have began there and then in a buffet cup splattered metal, we do not know we cannot Guess who would have emerged victorious or we can say with certainty was the the psychopath poacher arrived on the scene from whence he came, we know not and whether he went only Keith the horse knows

Frank Key  21:59
the psychopath poco level his shotgun. First he shot Satan. Then he shot father Ninian tongue back. Then he plucked A Fistful of butter cups and trudged across the meadow to where Keith waited patiently. He climbed into the saddle. Gary up, he yelled, and he galloped on Keith. He had buttercups phase the lady love in this gorgeous, terrible world. Even psychopath poachers have devoted lady loves.

Frank Key  22:53
I think I've got time to read this next bit to you. I got a letter from Tim thurn. Back that he said, Mr. Key, I couldn't help noticing in your piece about Satan, the little bunny rabbit, but you clearly were a lot how to bring your trifling Bagatelle to a close. Hence the introduction at the end of a psychopath poacher who was able to wrap things up in short order. It's not However, this rather desperate bit of folly roll what bothers me of more concern is that no where do you acknowledge that you've stolen this character from the much loved writer of pulp fiction Ned peasant in the 1920s and 30s. His tales of rustic violence featuring the psychopath poacher appeared in dozens of clip sensational magazines, among them tales of rustic violence, thrilling yarns of deranged peasantry, and countryside psychosis weekly to number three, it pains me to accuse you of brazen plagiarism the sticky but sadly, that is what I must do. I will be pinning up an accusation or a notice to that effect in my local community hub later today. You will not be welcome in my village should ever enter your head to pay us a visit yours more in sorrow than in anger. Tim thurn now, Tim will find it hard to believe, but I insist I've never ever heard of Ned peasant nor of his pulp writings. I somehow arrived at the finger of the psychopath poetry independently. Perhaps it was one of those weird and curious happenstances that have no rational explanation, like psychic for warnings of calamity or showers of showers of toad. However, taking my cue from Tim I did some research, and I was delighted to stumble upon a crate full of full of yellowing, dog eared copies of pulp magazines in one of my cupboards. Sure enough, I found that Ned peasant had contributed Most, if not all of the titles. I read through these stories avidly in one sitting. They included the psychopath poacher, slaughters and badger the psychopath poachers slaughter several badges on a duck and the psychopath poultry goes haywire, near a haystack and slaughters hundreds of badgers, several ducks and a vanbrugh kickin to number three. In my defense, I have to say that my own psychopath poker bears scant resemblance to the vivid and timeless fictional character created by Ned peasant. Nowhere for example, there's Ned's original gather a sprig of butter cups, phase lady love. Indeed, he doesn't seem to have a lady love at all. There is it's true, a recurring character called bonkers Maisie, who appears to do various bits of drudgery in a farmyard. But it's never suggested that there's anything between her and the psychopath poacher, safer a shared joy in drinking the spilled warm blood of freshly decapitated poultry. See, for example, the psychopath poacher and bonkers Maisie tamper with the farmyard spigot so that from it spurts the still warm blood of freshly decapitated poultry that was published in the eastern 1937 edition of the weekly digest of fictional farmyard spigot temporary things. I've been trying to discover the biographical details of Ned peasant with little success. One rumor which must surely be spurious is that late in life he was engulfed in a miasma cloud of mysterious gas shrunk to microscopic size, and after wafting about in the wind for some years, was eventually pocketed by Walter mad, the mad scientist who injected him into the brain of a mewling infant in a barking maternity hospital. Box parking maternity ward at a hospital at the tail end of the 1950s on January the 29th 1959. poppycock, no doubt. And that's actually the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope that all made sense. I read that last page rather quickly, but I'm sure you got the gist. And yeah, I'll be back next week with more of the same thanks to john for his and information and for engineering. And bye bye. Lesson
