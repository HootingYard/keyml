This is resonance 104 point four FM. Good afternoon. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Half an hour of prose. And of course Today is Valentine's Day. More importantly, I mean, Valentine's Day is fine and you're either in a state of romantic bliss or love long despair. But on the other hand, what you overlooked was that last Saturday was the feast day, not awesome Valentine, but St. Scholastica, who, among other things is the patron saint of convulsive children. This was good news for Pang Hill orphanage, where the Chinese are often convulsed by wild enthusiasms for exciting games, such as pin the paper to the hardboard and put the detritus in the wastebasket. St. Scholastica can also be invoked against rainstorms. So her feast day was doubly welcome, as Pang Hill is almost invariably lashed by ferocious teaming rain, no matter what the weather is like elsewhere. On Saturday morning, the orphans gathered in the big pantry behind the canteen to sing this special song. Oh Scholastica please stop the rains. So we can concentrate our fuming brains on playing watch the orphans faint Oh Scholastica, our patron saint. Meanwhile, many listeners if not all of you will be aware of the of the current fundraising drive to save resonance FM. And as part of that, I organized a sponsor a word or a sentence or a string of word or a name on hooting yard. And I said that if people gave a minimum donation of five pounds, I would include their word or words in a specially written story. And so I'm going to read that out now. And after I've read it, I'll list the names of the people who donated except for the ones who didn't want to be named. And the story is called ice chaos. So if you donated you can listen out for your word, or words. And if you didn't, you can kick yourself and wish you had. And it's not too late to donate Of course, so you can still send money to resonance. Ice chaos was the headline in one of the newspapers last week. This followed a day when the unthinkable happened. a flurry of snow that settled for about 24 hours in the winter in Britain, a country in the Northern Hemisphere chaos indeed, or perhaps it was just a cold snap. It's true, though, that extreme or freakish weather conditions seem to be on the increase. There have been tornadoes in London, there was Hurricane Katrina, the Asian tsunami. Incidentally, let us take this opportunity to recall that the name of the seismologists to criticize the lack of an early warning system that could have saved thousands of lives lost in this tsunami was called Waverly person. Now it's been pointed out to me more than once that I'm hardly qualified to talk about extreme weather conditions. As the only weather we get it hooting yardi rain, sometimes torrential sometimes a drizzle, and this is true. What my critics fail to note is that ensconced in a cabin somewhere over by ballista lane bypass, we have a superb forecaster. I speak of course of little Severin, the mystic badger when it comes to predicting the weather little Severin is second to none, not even to the BBC is magnificent. Dan Corbett. If you've not watched Dan, visit a website called that's the weather for now. And be amazed. Little Severin the mystic badger has not yet been blessed with a fan site on his own, but it can only be a matter of time. Before we go on, I want to make it absolutely plain that there is neither a job not Intel of truth. In the rumors that have been flying around. Little Severin did not pass through a cat flap to the afterlife. In any case, he would have stood a cat flap and sought a more appropriate badger flap flaps for badgers and indeed for stoats, pigs, wild hogs, otters and curlews some of which are flaps to the afterlife, and some not easily available, for example from zip and Nolan's flaberry in bassoon clock scheier

little sufferings method of weather divination is simple yet brilliant. He is not known as the mystic badger for nothing. At various times of day or night, he emerges from his cabin and scrambles around in the muck like badgers do. Then he goes back indoors. Voila, those able to read the omens and portents of his scrabbling know whether tomorrow will bring rain downpour or drizzle. And not only that, for little Severin can predict more than just the weather. Few people are aware that he forecast both the cod wars between Britain and Iceland, which lasted for 17 years. And the corned beef was between Ireland and Argentina, which lasted 30 among many other world shaking events. To date, there have been no oregano wars, as far as I'm aware. Bear in mind that a number of little severance predictions are retrospective for as his name implies, he is only little and mystic. It's it is the mysticism which so upset Braithwaite, that one time bus seat companion of Clytemnestra duggleby it was Braithwaite with his pipe, his face his cheese, his keys, his recitals, his cup, his roll on roll off rimfire firemen, and that lip on him, the lip and the sculptured boy hair. Braithwaite, who called into question the accuracy of little severing of the mystic badges, poor scrabbling weather forecasts. But what did he know? As Clytemnestra duggleby, attested in court after the incident with the wheezing Scrivener and the invalid PostScript font, he spent most of his time slumped in front of the radio, like some anti diluvian beast listening distractedly, to the say guns, or possibly the sack guns, or long running cereal about a husband and wife team Carl and Francoise and their thrills, spills, window sills and gas bills as they bring up their Papoose booboo.

As promised, I'll read out the names of Those who donated money to help save resonance FM and therefore had their words included in that piece. And they are in alphabetical order. pansy cradle drew William English on behalf of fathering gay CJ Halo goto luncheon, which is an anagram, also known as john alcohol, not cage, which is also an anagram. Sandra Harris, Karolina Herbst. lankton outer Spaceman, Michael Pierce, Marvin suicide, Chris Weaver, and others wish to remain anonymous which as it begins with a or to have been at the beginning of the list, but wasn't. I'm pretty sure I've not forgotten anyone. But if I have my profound apologies. And after that happy note, I'm afraid I must briefly make a couple of complaints of plagiarism. First of all, it's come to my attention that there is a website called Dobbs Sonia, which purports to be, quote, original dog sonian research by Tristan shuttering what in fact it is, is a hotchpotch of lies and inaccuracies about the out of print pamphleteer which could do serious damage to his reputation. There is a place for proper Dobson research on the worldwide interweb but this is not it. Just to give you a taste of this Farago of nonsense. Consider this twaddle by the so called shuttering. I will accuse Frank key of Charlotte Henry, I can reveal what the world's leading dogness is guilty of spinning, heretical, preposterous revisionist tract that entirely misrepresent Dobson and the true history of Dobbs sonian thought. I intend to reveal how Mr. Key has systematically distorted and concealed events from Dobson's life. I shall also prove that Dobson was married to marigold to I can reveal the sordid details of his lifelong blood feud with Blodgett and the Forgotten illegitimate love child, the grumpy man. All of this will be revealed in my new book, The Dobson code. Well, I'm not going to dignify such pap with a rejoinder. So, moving on. It's with some trepidation that I announced an imminent court case. For a long time I turned a blind eye to the continued boasts of the L'Oreal company that some of their shiny hair products are enhanced by light reflecting booster technology. I'm appalled that they continue to make this claim in their television adverts, despite numerous letters, urging them to desist. Well, I've been provoked far enough. Here at hooting yard we will be suing L'Oreal for infringement of intellectual property rights. Regular listeners will be aware that every single word of these podcasts and every single word that appears on the website could not have been wrenched from the innermost depths of my soul without hooting God's very own light reflecting booster technology. We got there first L'Oreal and if anyone can recommend a suitably shabby and cheap solicitor, please let me know because I'm worth it.

Okay, back to normal now after all that twirling around. This is a story called The Parrish wolf. Last week we held a funeral service for the parish Wolf, although none of us is sure if it's really dead. It's howling has not been heard for 12 years though, and under our laws, a death certificate can be issued for a missing wolf after just five years. The general feeling in the parish was summed up by the Sexton, in a notice nailed Luther fashion to the door of the church. Even in the absence of a corpse it would be for the good of the parish if obsequies were held. This was the gist of his noticed, though it was couched in the mighty pros he deployed even when writing nature notes for the parish newsletter, and he did not on any account use the word closure. One reason the Sexton is so persuasive is that his appearance and bearing are strongly reminiscent of the actor James Robertson Justice 1907 to 1975. This is no accident. Over the years the Sexton has worked hard to imitate that booming voice, and he has undergone cosmetic surgery, the better to eight for the appearance of the man who, when not appearing in films, kept busy as a naturalist racing driver and falconry expert. Before dawn on the morning of the funeral, there was a teeming downpour. The rain had ceased by the time we gathered in the churchyard, but the pecan trees were drenched, water droplets dripping from the tiny gray spongy buds each Bob like the brain of our home musculus. An extraordinary number of puddles had formed on the paths, and there are many paths converging on St. bibley. They've Dibs first is the only church for many miles around all others having been smashed to ruination by the sextons predecessor single handedly. He was twice the size of the present incumbent, a titan among sextons and a brute and the parish has been much quieter since he wilted away and was carted off to a Mercy Home. Now, ducks clashed in the puddles for word had not yet reached them that the parish wolf was dead, or at least was thought to be dead, and no duck dead come near for fear of being torn to bits. I had been asked to read the obsequies and had prepared what I thought was a pretty speech. I have a weakness for alliteration and made use of lots of W words describing the parish Wolfers winsome and windswept and waterlogged and wirey and woebegone and witless. There was little truth in any of this for the signal fact about the wolf was that it was for the most part invisible. Kim fat glue. The village bus driver claims to have seen it crossing the road once or twice, and the preposterous tabloid astrologer Jonathan caner, who once spent a week holed up in Oldsmar, brownstones Bed and Breakfast establishment said that the wolf paid him nocturnal visit in his dingy room, but few of us gave these tails any credence. Yet, despite remaining unseen the wolf was or had been a mighty presence in our parish, and I felt it deserved a memorable send off with all those w words, even if what I said was inaccurate. arvika had been abducted by a car dealer of Rogue tandis and was tied up in a turret somewhere, so the Sexton took charge of the service. When it came my turn to speak. No sooner had I propped my notepad on the lectern and cleared my throat. Then there came a bellowing of cows from the fields of joining the church. My words were drowned out. The cows bellowed all day and all night and into the next day, for they were mad old farmer fracks cows, and there were hundreds of them massive and ungainly and bellowing. The funeral broke up in disarray, and we repaired to a hangar at the village airfield, and we ate cake and macadamia nuts under the shadow of gigantic propellers. And when we emerged, look, ducks populated the puddles. The Parrish wolf was dead and gone.

I've just received an email, which is self explanatory. I'll read it. Luckily, they've been able to it's addressed to the resonance staff. But while it became all become clear, dear pals, it says, Please tell Frank for accuracies sake only that Waverly person was not the one who complained about the lack of tsunami warnings. He was the guy who did nothing and was amazed when others complained that his apparent carelessness thanks yours, an anonymous donor. Well, I stand corrected

This is called Dobson chartreuse whiskered. In her neglected book. I'm gonna start again this is called Dobson chartreuse Westgate. In her book neglected classics of hysterical and overwrought prose. The scholar Constance mussten mentions in passing, quote, an out of print pamphlet by Dobson, in which he gives a highly amusing account of his purchase of a short rose West kit. Unquote. This reference buried in a footnote to a footnote to a footnote, long perplexed Dobson lists of various stripes, none of whom could identify with any confidence the pamphlet mufon had in mind and alarming young Dobson is named Ned pond life track down the aged scholar to a chalet perched on a flinty outcrop and hammered at her door, intending to question her directly about the source of her assertion. Nowhere else is there any record of Dobson wearing or even owning a Westgate, chartreuse or otherwise, and panjal I thought that if he could solve this admittedly small mystery, his reputation as a Dobson list would be boosted. Alas, upon entry upon opening her chalet door, Constance muffin took one look at the young upstart and fell into a swoon, a swoon that presage to decline, a decline which had her carted off but willdan at home, a bewilderment home where she made and dribbled and trued Brazil nuts and sucked butterscotch, and finally passed in to the realm beyond petty earthly cares. Indeed, Ned pond lives countenance was truly terrifying. On a blistering September day, during his childhood pond life had had the misfortune to be attacked by both a flock of starlings and a swarm of Hornets, and although he was left with no physical scars, thereafter, the horror of what he had undergone on the lawn and at the mouth of the cave in the September sunshine in his little sailors suit, age six could be seen on his face, or twitching and bonkers. The ambitious young dogs in his next step was to consult an inventory of the out of print pamphleteers wardrobe if such a thing existed. He visited any number of libraries and academic institutions catching a bus pass, but wherever he went, found he had to avert his gaze from frightened puppies, which yapped at his approach, and his progress was thus accompanied by such a din that serious research became impossible. question, Why were there so many puppies in the vicinity of these libraries and seats of learning? Answer because the puppies were the offspring of the guard dogs left free to roam with impunity until they were old enough to join the elite corps of library hounds and do Sentry duty in their turn. Ned pond life was in danger of growing old and creaking before he discovered the truth about Dobson chartreuse westgrid. From time to time, he thought about diverting his attention elsewhere. By making a special study of Dobson's breakfast, or of his failed thought control experiments, his pin cushions and pencil sharpeners. The big flap when he gaming became wedged in a crevasse. His correspondence with Ringo Starr, his lapsang Sutra on his tin, his talc, even his encounter with the rancorous squeegee Goblin. But not one of these projects could ever inspire him as thoroughly as the mystery of whether or not Dobson had bought a chartreuse West kit, and if he had when and where he had worn it, and why. What was so maddening was that it just didn't seem like a piece of Dobbs Sonia and a tire. And yet, until her late befuddlement Constance muffin had been one of the most assiduous of Dobson scholars, and her work was respected from pointy town mustard parva and beyond. Surely she could not be mistaken. But she was.

I mentioned in that last piece, that term named pond life considered making a study of Dobson's breakfast and someone wants did given a task describe a typical Dobson breakfast seen. On the face of it this sounds like a simple enough assignment. It is, of course anything but those who have even a passing acquaintance with the Titanic out of print pamphleteer know that the words typical and breakfast can never be crammed together. It is an understatement to say that he had mixed feelings about breakfast. There were times when he was up and about before dawn gobbling down a huge bowl of porridge there again. He sometimes stumbled downstairs at noon bleary and fractious, waving his arms in dismissal of a profit slice of toast. from one day to the next. There was no knowing how Dobson would greet the day and howsoever he did greeted no knowing with what foodstuffs if any, the day would commence. I can't in all honesty, then describe a typical Dobson breakfast scene as is required. Instead, I proposed to examine two dogs sonian breakfast from different stages in his life, to which I will add some observations on a pamphlet he planned but never wrote. Will that do? The first breakfast scene is one that took place when Dobson was living around the corner from them satorious flapper popsy shadrack policies well kept secret at the height of her flapper them was that she was the devoted Mother of an infant, her daughter grew up to become the Daredevil adventurous tiny Enid. At the time of this breakfast, however, tiny Enid was not even a twinkle in her mother's eye. popsy was returning from a gin joint and crashed her jalopy into Dobson's hedge, waking the pamphleteer who leaped out of bed thundered out into his front garden, carried the stand Denny mundane into his parlor, and sought to revive her by winding up his gramophone and playing the dodrio from bohuslav Martin who's Concerto for String Quartet and orchestra at his splitting volume. With popsy sprawled on the couch and music moving inexorably towards its sonorous be minor climax, Dobson busied himself in the kitchen. Outside it began to pour with rain and steam hissed from the jalopy smashed up engine, so much steam that the hedge was obscured. This was the inspiration for Dobson's tremendous pamphlet hedges hidden from sight by steam out of print. When the music stopped, Dobson bid the groggy but only slightly injured flapper to join him at the breakfast table. He preened an eight bloaters pops he contented herself with a tumble of tumbler gin for her wrist was sprained and she could not hold the glass. We move forward for decades to consider a second Dobson breakfast scene. bloaters have their place here too, but there is no gin no popsy shadrack no tiny Enid and no hedge hidden by steam. In fact, there is no hedge at all for Dobson has moved on, as we all must sooner or later. The second breakfast I invite you to ponder was prepared and consumed in an ante room on the sixth floor of a palace belonging to the planet potentially overthrown General of a disputed territory south of the great frightening River. What in heaven's name with the impecunious pamphleteer doing in such sumptuous surroundings? I should point out that he was only there for three days having been invited under the mistaken assumption that he was a tuner of pianos and easy errors are make given that his most recent pamphlet was entitled I piano tuner. Dobson's hosted clearly not read beyond the cover page for even a cursory reading of the text which show that pamphleteer was wholly ignorant of his subject. It is one of his most mystifying cracked, be largely concerned with the unrelated topics of soup buttons are set up within this piece by mentioning an unwritten Dobson pamphlet. He planned at one stage to compile a list of every breakfast he had ever eaten from infancy onwards and made some preparatory notes to that listing he intended to add observations on place settings, tablecloths, cutlery, and crockery and general ambience. We should be thankful that he never actually wrote this work for it would have been as dull as dishwater, but not the fearsome ditch water that was the main ingredient of the palace breakfast. That ditch water was by no means doll. For when a factotum poured, Dobson's beaker fall down the sink, it sizzled and hissed and corroded the piping, it corroded the piping of the palace, and the palace collapsed. And that's the end of this week's show. There actually was a gap in that story to fit in the time. I don't know if you noticed, and if you did, you can read it on the website. Bye bye.
