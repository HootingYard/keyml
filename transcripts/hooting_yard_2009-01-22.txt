Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is the first hooting yard show of 2009. Apart from either an extended New Year break unutterable TDM, I won't tell you about that. And I'd like to begin with a piece which is a new version of an Old Testament story about Judas and hollow Fermi's. So those of you who know your Bible will know the story of Judith and holofernes. I can't remember which book it's in somewhere in the Old Testament, and this is a new version of it. How now, holofernes said Judith holofernes puts down his sack of grubbing on the floor and leaned to kiss the back of Judas hand. Your moustache is very bristly holofernes said Judith, I fear it has raised tiny scratches on my hand. plunge it into a tub of ointment, and it will be right as rain woman shouted holofernes holofernes always shouted. He was that kind of general. Oh, nevermind holofernes I'm fond of your mustache. It suits you. It is how shall I say? decisive? Said Judith. holofernes picked up his sack of grubbing again. He was blushing slightly. I must take this sack of grubbing to my encampment, woman, he shouted. It will not do for me to dilly dally with a widow woman such as yourself. What a pity holofernes said Judith. I've just borrowed some interesting pamphlets by Dobson from the mobile library, and I thought you might like to join me in browsing through them. We could go and sit upon a municipal park bench and take a picnic with us. I have some radishes and coleslaw, and a jug of potato pulp diluted with rainwater. holofernes was a sucker for pamphlets, particularly ones written by Dobson and he needed a little persuading to join today's in the municipal Park. The clouds when during however, see here woman, he shouted after swallowing a mouthful of coleslaw. If it begins to rain, these pamphlets will get soaking wet, and when you return them to the library on or before the due date. There may be ructions I'm sure you know a thing or two about ructions holofernes, said Judith coquettishly. But don't worry, I have a tarpaulin here in my Pipi bag, and in the event of a downpour. I can take it out and unfold it and placed the pamphlets underneath it. Here have another radish. hollow Fermi's furrowed his massive forehead as if deep in thought, but then seemed to relax and taking the profit radish pops it into his mouth and crunched it. Judas caught a glimpse of his teeth. Have you had a rental? recent? Sorry, have you had a recent dental checkup? holofernes. She asked. That woman is between me and my dentist. It is unseemly for a widow woman from Beth gulia to pry into such matters. shouted holofernes Please forgive me. holofernes said Judith. I was forgetting my manners there for a moment. But I was a little concerned that you may need an appointment with the hygienist for I clearly saw scraps of raw meat and carrots and cake crumbs stuck between your teeth. You've not been flossing Have you? holophone. his temper flared. He stood up, picked up his sack of grumblings and was about to stomp off out of the municipal Park when there was a cloud berth and the rain began teaming down. Quick holofernes helped me to one Fold the top polling, said Judith. Two minutes later, the Dobson pamphlets were safely covered up but both Judith and holofernes was sopping wet. When the rain stops will to find a little Bowman's hat in which to dry off and get a nice cup of tea said Judith, just like Laura and Alec in brief encounter of the falls into the boating lake. Come to think of it. She added you remind me of Alec's friend Dr. Steven Lin played in the film by Valentine dial except that Steven didn't have a decisive mustache, and he was a bit of a prig. I knew not a prig Are you holofernes I am a general in Nebuchadnezzar mighty army woman shouted holofernes That is all you need to know. Oh, you're such a grumpy General holofernes said Judas. You know what I think would be good for you some aroma therapy, but you strike me as more of a sweat lodge kind of chap.

Enough woman shouted holofernes you may seek out and humble boatman tat if you wish, but I must return to my encampment with my sack of grubbing. I shall dry off in my tent, which is a tent fit for a general. Well, I shall come with you. So Judith holofernes grumbled, but he was secretly delighted for there was something about this widow woman that intrigued him and inflamed his passions. They set off across the plains together. Tell me about Babylon holofernes where your King Nebuchadnezzar lives? I have heard it's full of Rastafarians smoking, Ganja and moaning on and on rhythmically, of course, about their misery said the truth. As a general in the army woman, I paid no heed to such countercultural doings shouted holofernes I have enough on my plate, keeping my troops on their toes and smiting mine enemies with a big sword. Who said Judith, you'll have to let me see that big sword when we get back to your encampment. holofernes later, of course, when they were in holofernes tent, and he showed Judith his big sword, she used it to slice his head off. Then she went back to Brasilia, carrying the head of holofernes and was received in triumph by her people.

bluestocking polymath dot 10 has a new book out next month, a magisterial study of aquatic birds entitled dots ducks there are two very curious things about this hefty hardback and I think it right that you're made aware of them before shelling out your cash for a copy. It's the first of 10s innumerable books not to feature on its dust jacket, a mezzotint by her brother, Rex, tinned the noted mezzotint is indeed a considerable number of her earlier titles have been absolutely riddled with mezzotints, often quite gratuitously, so much so that there are cynics who claim dotties keeping Rex gainfully employed, whereas without her patronage, he would be starving in some sort of mezzotint cyst Garut surviving on style class on crust and tap water. This is piffle Of course for Rex tent is never short of commissions, and has been known to turn work down. For example, when he was asked a couple of years ago to create a gigantic mezzotint to be displayed on the wall of a house owned by the Belgian actor and martial arts expert john crude cameo Francoise van valkenburg, better known as john Claude Van Damme. It's not known whether the star chose his professional name to echo Philip Van Damme the villain played by James Mason in North white by Northwest, but we do know that Rex snubbed him despite being offered a very large amount of Belgian money. Whether dot pays Rex at all for the mezzotints he has until now provided for her books is unclear, making the charges that he is kept mezzotint is all the more laughable. The absence of his work from dot ducks has led to speculation that there may have been a falling out between the siblings. Rex is notoriously temperamental, and has recently grown a preposterous beard that's obscuring the distinctive tint family cast of his features. So that might be something to do with it. I suppose if he shaves his beard often is subsequently invited by his sister to provide mezzotints for her next book will have a better understanding of the matter. Time will tell. The second curious thing about docks docks is the inclusion of a vast amount of material about owls. owls are not ducks and dock 10 cannot seriously believe that they are yet there are pages upon pages of our related material offered without any qualification or explanation. I've read my advanced copy of the book twice all the way through. And sure enough, we go from mallari to merganser. To teal to owl to shelduck. to pop charts to Buffalo As if in tents, world, owls are ducks. It's all very strange, or at least it was until quite by chance the other day I came upon what what may be an answer to the riddle. I was browsing through a back number of the magazine, traumatic childhood incidents of blue stocking polymaths. And lo and behold, there was a lengthy piece of anecdotes about dot tent. Apparently, when she was five or six years old, on a family holiday at a gruesome seaside resort, she was gambling and frolicking upon the beach when, panting with infant Glee, she stopped to catch her breath and looked out to see where she saw a rowing boat. her eyesight was piercing back then, and she could clearly make out that there were two people in the rowing boat. One was rowing in a fairly lackluster way, while the other person was holding a sack. All of a sudden, as Dr. tent watched, this person took an owl out of the sack and held it under the water until it drowned, whereupon the dead owl was put back in the sack and the rower rode the rowing boat away with greater urgency. It does not take our mind doctor to conclude that the traumatized child thereafter held fast to the delusion that owls were ducks, the water their habitat, and that she had not seen an owl cruelly drowned, but merely one taking a dip in the sea. If anything, this forgotten magazine article makes dots dots an even more compelling book than it otherwise would be, despite the absence of mezzotints by the mezzotint. Just wrecks tent. I buy a copy if I were you.

So, go to the website at www dot hooting yard.org and click on the little subscriptions tab. And now you'll find out all about it basically is just a way to donate to me every month. This is called spillage on cambric. Having spilled his soup on a piece of cambric the verger tried to amend his sloppiness by dabbing the cam break with a damp sponge. Excuse me, alas, so much chemical colorant had been added to the soup, which was of a tomato flavor. And so hastily and violently did the virgin do his dabbing. That a bright orange stain was impressed into the cambric. The Cambrian, by the way was blue with golden stars, like the vault of heaven, fearing that he had in a radical in a radical bleed to besmirched a representation of the ethereal realm. The villager hit the camera in the sponge in a cupboard and pulled the remainder of his tomato soup down the drain. He cleaned his bowl and spoon with more care than he had dabbed the camera and placed them exactly where he had found them among the crockery and cutlery, having first dried them with a tea towel depicting the martyrdom of St. Anselm. This was an historically inaccurate tea towel, as St. Anselm died a natural death rather than being martyred for his faith. It was not the only erroneous tea towel in the kitchen. The verger hoped that hiding the evidence of his sloppiness in the cupboard would prevent it from coming to light, but he reckoned without the involvement of dishes Detective Captain Kirk pan. The detective was called in by the bishop on an unrelated matter, something to do with the local sniper who'd been taking potshots at the cathedral hens. Karch pan was noted phase energetic approach to police work. And on this occasion, he strained so many sinews, that by mid morning, he was exhausted and dehydrated. characteristically, he did not whimper to the bishop begging for refreshments, but instead blundered about until he found the kitchen, where he intended to gulp down water straight from the tap. Having done enough gulping to make himself feel human again. kargh pan could not resist opening all the drawers and cupboards in the kitchen and examining their contents with his magnifying glass. Such was his method. Although it was unlikely that either the sniper or the hens had ever been in the kitchen, the detective assume nothing. That's it was that he discovered the hidden camera and sponge. He was extremely suspicious of the bright orange stain.

Frank Key  16:11
Excuse me. Under questioning, The Verge admitted his part, but insisted that the sponge and the camera had no connection to the sniper and the hens. Detective Captain kargh pan roughed him up a bit breaking one of his arms and dislocating his jaw. This too, with his method, the verge of continue to protest his innocence throughout his subsequent trial, and the long years on the prison Hulk more of an unspeakable stretch of coastline. Long after his death, campaigners sought for him a posthumous pardon. But we now know that karg pan was right all along, and that the verger and the sniper were one on the same interviewed for a television documentary during his long and happy retirement car. kapan explained that for him, it was an open and shut case. A man who can smear tomato soup upon a picture of the vault of heaven, and who makes use of historically erroneous tea towels is precisely the sort of man who would shoot it innocent clucking hens with a mannlicher carcano rifle. He said, Today, we're at last able to acknowledge the wisdom of those words.

Well, we have two different holofernes and now some more history. Last pawson of clue Zeum by the nine Gods he swore that the great house of Tarquin should suffer wrong no more. Over in Rome, Lucien tarquinius Superbus had been overthrown, and he asked laws as a fellow elektrischen for help. last thought about it for a bit, and it was when he decided to march to tarquinius his aide that he did the swearing bit with the nine gods that took a good deal of time, as some among the gods demanded that when they were sworn by the swearing had to be an elaborate invocation of rolling phrases, complex rhymes and repetitive besieging laws. Posner was well prepared, taking a packed lunch and a big flask filled with a foamy, hallucinogenic portation up into the Etruscan hills, where he planned to do his swearing. There's been some debate about the precise identities of the nine gods, he kabane Brewer has them as Juno, Minerva, and tinea or 10, or Tina, the three chief of trust and Gods joined by Vulcan Mars, Saturn Hercules semanas, invidious, but this list finds no place for such exciting Etruscan deities as katha and who sell sell vans to Iran and lahren nor founder terms and flatlands, sometimes known as puff lungs. It seems scarcely credible that a king like last Posner would leave flans out of his swearing on a hillside, we might want to consider the alternative godly roll call given by pebble head in his best selling paperback laws, where he gives pride of place to Tina and farmlands and trucks in seven others mentioned above. It's true that his book is a novel rather than the history and that he veers off into a subplot about Tina and families canoodling in the Etruscan forest. But pebble head has studied these things, and has the benefit of a number of scholarly works published since brewers day, including Dobson's pamphlet, the same person's guide to swearing by the Etruscan Gods out of print. So that was last a few days before he set out for Rome. up in the hills under a luring sky. He ate some bite sized cottage pie style snacky chunks and wash them down with several gulps from his flask, ensuring that his brain underwent preliminary dislodgement. Then he gathered some sticks and tied to each stick a colorful ribbon he had brought with him in his kingly Etruscan Pipi bag, and he poked the sticks into the hillside muck to form a magic pattern. Nine sticks in all, one for each God. He took a few more swings from his flask, further shattering his reason. And then he sprawled in front of the stick tied with a beige ribbon representing the God who sill and began screaming his head off.

Frank Key  21:13
Eu sell EU sell EU sell bold EU sell EU sell. Currently the will to kill EU sale. Let me not dilly dally nor be ill EU sale. If I kept your chill EU sale up in these hills. Give me some pills. Ooh, sell. Ooh, sell. And so it went on for hours, with an occasional pause for more foaming hallucinogenic quotation from the flask until last pawsome it was completely cracked and exhausted. The God who sell Let it be known that it was satisfied with the king's swearing by sending a shower of sparks to dance around his head and half blind him. Last pause on a fumble about untying the ribbon from the uzel stick and burning both the ribbon and the stick and stamping on steadily upon the embers and he ate another bite sized cottage pie style snacky trunk and Gulp from his flask and then he took a nap one god down eight mortars swear by. We shall not bother to run through in detail the other squarings although it has to be said that when it was far flung turn, Lars Porter outdid himself. It took the best part of a day to complete what was the scariest of the squarings by any stretch of the imagination. So wild and loud and crazed to the king become, to be attracted the attention of a little not of a Tuscan peasant who were heading down the hillside after a hike. They recognized last Paulson by his kingly garb, and were shocked to see him in so demented a state alternately screeching fantastic you Relations at a stick in the ground, and shoveling mouthfuls of soil down his gob. One wonders what will become a clue sium ruled by such a king, said one peasant. I fear that it may be swallowed up by the National Roman Republic and vanish from history, said another peasant. The third peasant in the knot chivvied his colleagues to continue down the hillside into downtown clues Ium so that they were home in time for their a trust can suffer. There was no such comfort for last persona, he still had two more gods to swear by. And having eaten the last of his bite size cottage pie style snacky trunks had to grab about in the muck for barely edible roots before taking his next nap. By now of course, his brain had been bent and cranked to such an extent by his quotation of which much still remained in his huge flask that his naps were accompanied by strange and terrible dreams. He dreamed he was a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silence sees. He dreamed he saw his head grown slightly bald, broken upon a platter. He dreamed he was in rat Sally with a dead man lost their bones. And he dreamed twit twit twit jog jog jog, jog, jog jog. When he woke up in the hills, it was raining, hard fat drops of Etruscan rainfall hammered upon the king's head. It did not take him long to swear by terms for terms wasn't easily assuaged. God. Last pause and I remembered with brilliant clarity the words he'd learned as an infant at The role of trust and faith based community education hub. He had had an excellent teacher, a bat robed figure with a squeaky voice and a genius for arresting similes. The God terms he had said, it's like a silken girl bringing sure but at the same time like a camel man cursing and grumbling. Last never forgotten that if he had been beaten into him with a stick, a stick rather bigger than the sticky now burned up on the hillside together with the ribbon he had unfastened from it. He had one more gods to go alone, and when all nine sticks and their ribbons had been burned to nothingness, he would be ready to follow the peasants trail down the hillside and march off in aid of Lucius tarquinius Superbus.

Frank Key  25:54
I see glugged another draft of foamy hallucinogenic quotation, last one that FEMA ages to come, he too might be known as Superbus last pause on us Superbus, or even last porcelana, Uber superbooth. It had a ring to it. He imagined that there might come a time when a future princeling preparing to wage war upon a foe might come to these very same hills and swear by him by laws, and burner by ribbon, stick in his name, and beat us emboldened and blessed. It was not beyond the bounds of Etruscan possibility that he might become a God would cluse him be a fit stamping ground for a deity, he would have to ensure when he made the transformation from mortal to divine that his bodily remnants were placed in an elaborate tube in or under the city he rolled, with a 15 meter high rectangular base, and sides 90 meters long. adorned by pyramids and massive bells. He polished off the scary stuff with the final God burnt the final ribbon and the final stick and emptied what was left in the huge flask down his throat. And then last pause on a stumbled away down the hillside, rain battered and brain biters and leaving behind him a pile of ashes. Soon he would hate them to roam and come face to face with heroic one eyed Hiroshi is Copley's and make history. Curiously, in his best selling paperback laws, pebble head has absolutely nothing to say about this history. The novel ends with Tina and flatlands doing gaadi things in the ethereal realm, the eponymous King, quite forgotten, and not remotely Superbus.

That's the end of this week's hooting yard. I hope you enjoyed it. Just a final note, back in November, you may recall we had a brief look at George Orwell's diary, and its exclusive concentration on egg counting. But there was an entry at the end of last year or the end of 1938 as opposed to 2008. The 26th of the 28th of December, have been ill not certain about number of eggs, but about nine. Not certain Get a grip George Orwell Get a grip. And that's the end of this week's show. Bye bye
