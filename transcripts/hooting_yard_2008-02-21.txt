Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air. And my name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you. And you know what, I'm going to read exactly what I read last week, because due to technical problems, apparently the show last week was virtually Inaudible. Or it sounded as if I was sitting in a, in a cavernous room. And so, I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, we're just gonna have the same show. It'll be almost a repeat, but not quite. And what I read last week that was a normal or inaudible was Hang on, we're having some engineering adjustments taking place even as I speak. Right. They have now been adjusted. And last week's show, which was inaudible was number two in a series of previously on podcast stories, despite the fact that there are untold hours of hooting yards that have been podcasts and are available to listen to. There are some stories that have never been podcast. And this is one of them it. I'll begin reading it this week, and I will continue to read it next week because it's a fairly long story for me. It's called by aerostat to hooting yard. I so wanted this to be a seafaring yarn. I wanted to hear the wind in the rigging smell assault Tang in the breeze. Roll with the creek and look of old wooden boards on the deck. I wanted to write a maritime tale of a fabric woven of ships cables and hoses, and Arctic wind blowing through it and birds of prey hovering over it. I wanted to prattle on about smacks bilgewater focus holes and splicing the main brace whatever that means. Pirates would appear cutlasses, gleaming. perched in the crow's nest, I would yell land Ahoy, then scurry down the rigging to help tamp down the pinnacles. At first things that looked hopeful, I had received my instructions from Dobson as ever he was precise. track down bubble he wrote, beat him to death with a club, wrap him in chains and throw him down a flooded mineshaft I should expect a full report upon your return Dobson. As soon as I had read his memo, I doused it in highly inflammable chemicals and took it down to the boiler room of my building. There in solitude and gloom. I placed it in the roaring furnace. The flames licked up towards my face and I turned away. I knew the tears would not be long in coming. It had been two years since one of Dobson's communicated uprooted me from my rut, and catapulted me into a frantic adventure. Three years before that I had been sent on a mission ranging over four continents. The year before that embroiled in a world shattering plot, and there had been at least half a dozen earlier escapades. No doubt these Dobson inspired excitements were meant to be wild and life enhancing, yet I yearn for tedium and futility. Try trudging out of the boiler room I began to solve. It would be weeks, perhaps months before I could once again wallow in monotony and on we despite my misgivings, I'm very particular about my work. Dobson has even accused me of being finicky. I began to pack at once having dusted down the enormous have a sack which I always carry on my assignments. Within an hour of receiving my instructions, the packing was done. And I was perched on a wooden stool in my kitchen, wolfing down a bowl of slops. I had no idea where next I would eat. Having twice been struck by lightning while doing Dobson's bidding, I had taken the precaution of sprinkling finely ground purslane onto my slops and stashing a small patch of the stuff in my hammer sack. another half hour and I was out the door and on my way, the weather was incomprehensible. I shall not record it here. I checked my watch by the gasworks clock and spat into a hedgerow.

It was not for me to question why Dobson wanted burble obliterated. Yet I could not help feeling a small pang of surprise. I had always understood burble to be a trusted agent, a man who could be relied upon. I knew for a fact that he had been invaluable when Perkins and throwback contracted the dank and what ensnared by a band of repressed ma hoots. I could only assume that he had lightly committed some heinous offense for which Dobson could not forgive him. What on earth could he have done? But I could not allow myself to dwell on such matters. It wouldn't get the dog bathed, the roof fed or the baby mended, whatever that saying is a spat into a hedgerow and lurched onwards. Over the years I have paid a great deal of attention to gait and have a repertoire of ambulatory techniques which the greatest of actors would envy. My usual form of locomotion is a sort of half ish lope. That should go without saying that when engaged on one of Dobson's missions, I take diligent pains to disguise this prancing, hobbling, limping, trudging, and scampering can all be brought into play. I am unusually adapted hurdling stamping and scaffolding, and have on occasion found it useful to bound stride plog Gadwal stalk. However, in the initial stages of any mission, I am an inveterate lurcher. I find that it aids the circulation hones the brain and abolishes any creeping panic. One day I shall write an essay explaining why I lurched to the docks Of course, all Dobson's assignments begin at the docks, while heating up the pan of slops in my kitchen. I had done a spot of preliminary research. The first thing I had to do was to find burble, and he could be anywhere. leafing through my card index I traced his movements over the past year, he had spent Easter with wooden bury in the Antarctic swiftly moving on through bloody fall and concrete like disappointment, elk, flin Flon and gubbio. I already knew that he been in Hobart for most of July. I was unable to discover his whereabouts during the latter part of that month, or for the first week in August. On the eighth However, he turned up in innsmouth, staying only a couple of days before a frantic spree through Jabal pork Kim tap logs middle tongue, NaVi bug, orb pickled Crow, corn, reindeer Depo and splat. He spent Christmas in teutoburg valid and typically saw in the New Year unced. Again, there was a gap then burble turned up once more in February in ventry. Then in weed after that, he traveled through drac six yard and zog an intriguing fellow, I thought to myself, but was he still in zog? I could only find out by going there. After all, I had to start somewhere. I allowed half an hour for the slops to digest using the time to trawl through the shipping timetables. I could make head nor tail of them. My head spam, shimmers and jangles frolicked in my brain and I nearly threw up my slops. I ingested a handful of crushed mugwort and immediately felt better. A good lurch weighed down by my hammer sack helped to dispel further the throbbing in my skull. It took just four hours to arrive at the docks. They were splendid, but indescribable. I think Dobson attempted to write about them in one of his absurd pamphlets. But as usual, I cannot remember a word of it. It hardly matters. I lurched past a group of stevedores who were mucking about with torque wrenches, baskets, lengths of flax, that sort of equipment. One of them resplendent in a toxic vest hailed me. You there, he cried. Can you lend us a hand with these torque wrenches, baskets and lengths of flax. I'll do what I can, I replied, easing my hammer sack to the ground and rolling up my shirtsleeves. This was a break I could ill afford to ignore. My plan was to stow away on board a steamer Bamford Zags nearest port, wherever that may be.

This subterfuge was a central It was quite impossible for me to buy a ticket. Have my name appear on a passenger list, dine the captain's table, take part in deck board ping pong tournament and such like hoo ha. I could not risk incurring Dobson's rough Look what lay in store for burble. This was the perfect opportunity. If I could win the confidence of the stevedores by dint of gorilla T and bonamy. They would hopefully assist me to board a ship in secret. I spat on my hands. How can I help? I asked. Could you help us put these torque wrenches into these baskets and rack these lengths of flats around them? said the stevedore. I nodded my assent. everything went according to plan. Some weeks later exhausted my spirit virtually broken. I was holed up below the decks of the milk toast Jesuit Jew to sale any day to a port near zog. My stevedore pals had been magnificent. Having identified the ship, they bribed one of the crew to arrange a space for me hidden among the stowage in the hole, where I could lie safely concealed for the duration of the voyage. This matter lot, who was grimy and incoherent was also to ensure that I did not starve or perish from thirst. Though I had no worries on that count, as I had packed several bags of machine my half a sack. dead of night I shared the last flagging of grog with the stevedores we sat around a rusted oil drum and a particularly smelly corner of the dockyard, our only light a storm lantern hanging from a nail rammed into the crumbling wall. at the appointed hour, the matter last arrived. We heard his sniffling before he came into view. This could not be tolerated. absolute silence would be necessary if we were to avoid discovery. The matter lots apologized with much slobbering explaining the only seconds before his arrival, he had developed a massive nosebleed. One of the stevedores was also wrapping a tourniquet around his neck to staunch the flow. But I managed to intervene, unleashing from my pocket a medical dictionary and brandishing it above my head. I always carry this little booklet with me on my assignment. Dobson had written it many years ago, and forbade his agents to move so much as an inch without it. Although it is woefully lacking in diagrams, it is a boon to the amateur, shedding adopt sonian light all sorts of maladies and distempers including a gues biting by mad dogs, choleric fluxes, dislocations, epidemics, frenzy goal, hoarseness, inflammations, drawn this knot in the flesh, loss of teeth. mag grins, noise in the ears, obstructions of the spleen, pestilence Quinsey, ringworm, Strang, Yuri Tatars, unmentionable, horas, vexation, Whitlow, Zento, gloss ik, fury, yowling, and zombie them. Where and when Dobson picked up all this information, I cannot say he certainly underwent no medical training to speak of, unless his autobiography is a pack of lies. That wouldn't surprise me leaving the stevedores to bone up on those bleeds. I rummaged in my half a sack and took out some pounds tongue and some knapweed both have been crushed to a powder and stored in leather pouches. I had only the grog to work with but I made an infusion and commanded the matter lot to drink it in one hurried slurp. Moments later, the bleeding stopped. He wiped his mouth and chin with a filthy rag and let out a belch. It was time to go

By aerostatic hooting yard continued Three weeks later, on the cover of a pitch black night sky. I boarded the packet steamer milk toast, Jesuit. The matter lot and I had had innumerable adventures in the interim, none of which I shall record here. Dobson would only complain. We made our way down into the Stone Age without being seen. The matter Lord had prepared for me a rough wooden box stacked among a heterogeneous jumble of crates, hampers barrels and bales. dribbling, he assured me that no member of the crew would ever come anywhere near this part of the hold the air what there was of it was disgusting and fetid. In the stinking gloom, which shook hands. I understood that the ship was to set sail at any time in the next four days, and that I would not see my accomplice again, until we were out at sea. Left and myself I let my karpin lantern and examine the wooden box which would be my home for the next few weeks or so I thought. The matter Lotte had done me proud. The box had been lined with plush Crimplene, cushions stuffed with natural sea sponge was strewn about as well little pop berries of Pimpernel and lavender. A rickety wooden shelf had been whacked up along one side of the box, containing a splendid library of books with which I could pass the time. Most of the titles were pulp science fiction or detective stories, including the zinc lozenge by Kappa, the windy Quaker by dawlish, the case of the tonchi drunks by Kurt pith and the X ray i'd galley slave by Sinbad Hoon jaw. I was pleased to note that I'd also been provided with a couple of stern devotional cracked prayer and imbecility by Monsignor tog and a flask of pottage by movement trellis. Underneath the shelf was a metal canister. I removed the lid and found that it was a portable refrigerator packed with highly expensive bottles of wine next to the canister with a dinky tray laden with a corkscrew wine glass and binary muffets. There was no sign of any food. Excuse me. There was no sign of any food, but I had my bags of mush, placing my have a sack in the cleverly designed cubby hole of the box. I reclined on the straw pallet, arranged some of the cushions around me, and tried to shrug off the foul stench assaulting my nostrils. Within minutes, I was fast asleep. Meanwhile, up on deck and unbeknown to me, the person was smearing all the lifeboats with a decoction of oakum and Wormwood. According to Dobson, this sort of thing is quite common, although ships crews are loath to admit it. When I woke up in my darkened, smelly box, my watch had stopped. Here was a predicament. I had no idea how long I'd been asleep. As I took cognizance of my surroundings, it soon became apparent that the milk toast Jesuit was still in port. I cracked open one of the one bottles and Swigged it through clenched teeth. Unfortunately, after a period of sleep, my coordination was not at its best and I managed to bash and dislodge one of my incisors. The wine swelled around in my gob mingling with blood which was now pouring from my gums. Have no matter what thought of packing a first aid kit, I doubted it. I spat into one of the pot berries and cursed heaven. As I did so I was astonished to hear the sound of footsteps and sniffling coming from somewhere among the ramshackle stacks of stowage. Moments later, the matter lot appeared, a torch clutched in his grimy fist. What on earth are you doing here? I hissed. The fool was meant to stay away from me until we were safely out to see if my presence were discovered. Now, I would without doubt be ejected from the ship and have my have a sack impounded by the maritime authorities. The same fate that had before and Perkins at the outset of the expropriated vinegar case. Dobson had been livid. The matter law did not reply. He merely handed me a scrunched up piece of paper, and turning on his heel scurried off. I was bewildered, but only for a moment, spitting out another garbett I unscratched the piece of paper it was blank.

Frank Key  20:00
What inanity was this, the metalock must have taken leave of his senses. In a sudden fury I tore the paper to shreds, then settled back on the palate to eat a bag of mush. Only as the last mouthful slithered down my throat. Did it occur to me that I must have looked at the wrong side of the paper. I was about to gather the shreds from the floor. When the Kirpan lantern went out. I was plunged into complete darkness, unable to see my hand in front of my face.

Frank Key  20:38
loc as Dobson says, begins with L. Another thing that begins with L is louts skull, a rare and spiky herb found only on a few mountain slopes in Van globs land. If boiled in a little oil. It is good for shrunken sinews, and it helps to relieve the dropsy and diseases of the spleen. Among its more unlikely properties, lout scowl will under certain conditions become incandescent and burst into an all consuming conflagration like until the fires of hell itself. As luck would have it, a crate of desiccated loud skull was among the cargo of the milk toast Jesuit and the conditions in the hole would just write for the inferno to be provoked. My Kirpan lantern did not as I thought go out. Rather, I was temporarily blinded by the intense brilliance of explosive louts go. That noise came afterwards. a horrible sucking and seething sound, redolent of leeches, tiny pigs and things that suck and seed. The water in the harbour evaporated. The ship itself simply vanished blown to smithereens. I have no idea how I walked out of the devastation alive, cluttering my have a sack, but I did.

Frank Key  22:33
My first thought was to find the martial art, or at least to ascertain whether he was alive or dead. After all, he may have disembarked just before the explosion, or he may have survived it as I had. I was about to prance into the nearest tavern. When I was waylaid by a spangled monster. It was hilariously unkempt, and its provenance was dubious, luring me into a shadowy nook it drummed in ground ground and drooled my pulse raced, I tried to work out how I could reach the turpentine gun in my have a sack before the monster did something unspeakable. I need not have worried it was Perkins Of course. I bring news from Dobson he said, unraveling himself from his stupendous disguise and lighting a cheroot. Gosh, I said, then, pulling myself together, I asked Perkins as calmly as I could what Dobson had to say. It was almost unprecedented to receive a further message following initial instructions. Dobson trusted his agents to get on with the job and truth. I felt indignant and told Perkins as much as he smiled. Dobson Dobson Dobson. He's in his dotage, you know that he hardly knows what he's doing anymore. He paused, seeming to agonize for a moment. Forgive me, I should not speak so. Dobson is Dobson. And that is enough. Let me tell you this message. Perkins, then spent about 10 minutes rummaging through a variety of pockets, pouches, fobs sockets, recesses and vanity bags, before triumphantly brandishing a crumpled shoe box in my face. Here it is. He cried. Tears of joy streaming down his face. Removing the lid from the box. He took out a little booklet leave through the pages stopped at one and wagging his finger in the air read regarding burble his travels over the last year or a series of untruths. I was nearly taken in. He has been holed up in hooting yard all the time. I'm not trying to interfere but I thought you ought to know Dobson. So bang went my chances of writing a seafaring young hooting yard was only two hours away by bus. Perkins and I vanished into the nearest Tavern to get drunk. As we talked, we talked, and as we talked, we discovered a mutual interest in the more tray aspect of Dobson's history, his love of abnormal biscuits, his residence for eight years and a colored dots house, the time he suffered from exposure in a foundry, his guilt about horses. The day he was injured by a jackhammer, his insistence that cracking had appeared in his latrine his macabre napkin, his ounce of pebbles, his questionable rubric, his slabs of titanium. His illegal adoption of an unhinged vintner is waterlogged. xylo graphs, and his pre dye election for yellow zips. After innumerable pints of sour stout, we reeled out of the tavern, Perkins turning off towards the abandoned firework Depo while I hurtled to the bus stop, where I discovered that all buses between the docks and hooting yard had been taken permanently out of service due to imponderable resin and pomposity. I lay prostrate on a paving slab and devoured another bag of mush then are returned to the tavern.

So that's part one of by arrow stat two hooting yard, and part two will be audibly broadcast next week on hooting out on the air. A couple of couple of things I should mention about that story. It's it's a very old, a very old story, one of the one of the first things published by the malice of forethought press, many decades ago, and it includes a quote a direct quotation from Herman Melville from Moby Dick. And it also contains a scene which I stole from the narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe. If you've never read that, I thoroughly recommend it. It's a fantastic story, really. What else? I think there might be other little thefts and things somewhere in the in the story. And excuse me, and that's it for this week. So as I say, I'll be back next week. The hooting yd website has been rather quiet for the last few weeks. That shouldn't last long, but if you want to go there is a www dot hooting yd.org. And while you're there, you can always buy the books. There's two books with two more to come this year, I think. So that's it then for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
