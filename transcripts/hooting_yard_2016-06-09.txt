Good evening This is resonance one I 4.4 FM This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key, and few things are as dull as other people telling you about their dreams. But whenever frightened to be down here on hooting yard, so I'm going to tell you about a couple of dreams I had in the last week. One night, Abby Oh, Faria was presented with a sheep. There was a broader context to this exciting scene, but it was obliterated the instant I awoke. All that remains is the brain in my mind is a smiling Abby al-farhan, circa 1967. Taking in his arms, or non smiling sheep. Younger listeners might not know who Abby ofori is. Abby was one half of Israeli pop duo, Esther and Abby Oh, far. Do you remember them john? JOHN doesn't remember Esther and Abby Oh, foreign they had a big hit in 1967 with Cinderella Rockefeller. They also did an extremely good version of mad about the boy by no coward. And as a solo artist, Esther appeared in the 1962 Eurovision Song Contest representing Switzerland. Don't say you never learned things from rooting out. Why Abby, oh farin turned up. unprompted in my dreams is a complete and utter mystery. And then the other night I was invited to Buckingham Palace to visit the pangolin it was kept in a grand stateroom along with two rather sleepy four grown tigers and a governess. The governor spoke to the pangolin which was wearing a little red pillbox hat in French. After observing these arrangements, I was escorted from the palace down a tree lined pathway by the Royal zookeeper, a gray haired man who expressed an interest in traveling to New York, and we discussed New York City. The pangolin was in this room in Buckingham Palace. No sign Ratner of Abbey Oh foreign or indeed eska.

Our Lady of the bumpkins is the object of dribbling veneration by the peasantry hear about that's pretty much all you need to know about her more pertinent That is why the peasants veneration is accompanied always by dribbling. To find out, let us enter a peasant hovel, I would recommend the powerfully fragrant nose guy. Once our eyes become accustomed to the gloom, we can see a middle of an admirable filth, such as the home life of our own dear peasantry, well, may happen not so dear. You will be thankful for the nose guy. You may also wish to have armed yourself with a sharp pointy stick to keep the peasant at bay. Should he approach you? But there's a little danger of that, because he's wholly occupied with veneration. He is sprawled on the ground, mouth open, dribbling freely. His idiot gaze fixated upon a statue of Our Lady of the bumpkins. It is raised above the piles of gruesome clutter, resting on a sort of shrine or altar. It emits another earthly glow and is the one clean thing for miles around. When he is not venerating it, the dribbling peasant special untold hours, spraying it with Polish from an aerosol canister and buffing it with rags. We poke him with the pointy stick to gain his attention. Still dribbling, he turns his head to look at us. Can you not venerate Our Lady of the bumpkins with your mouth closed, we ask. In reply the peasant grunts and returns to his dribbling veneration. Before leaving, we note that he collected dribbles in a rough hewn wooden cup artfully placed beneath his chin and lighter when we call into the villages one stop shop to return our rented nose guy and pointy stick. We note that there are shelves upon shelves stacked with similar cups of dribble. These are for sale at a hefty price to pilgrims who come from far and wide. Thus, does the one true faith maintain the rural economy in times of blight?

The top excuse me the tarpaulins of goose back. Oh, how we cherish them by Kevin things that would otherwise have got wet during spells of rainfall. Ah, you say, but it hardly ever rains in goose bag due to certain geographical oddities. I am unqualified to expound upon. I would have you expound upon them. Nonetheless. rainfall is a topic of quite staggering interest to me, and I can always I'm always keen to hear more about it, even from the unqualified. And there is nothing to stop you embarking on a course of study in rainfall, in any case, ending with a certificate or diploma, and then you would be qualified to expound but you remain silent. You do not make up, take up my challenge. You guys over my shoulder, and in the distance, you can see the flattened ruins of goose back, or you could if you were wearing your specs, but you left them on the sideboard in your hotel room, because you're forgetful. You are forgetful because you have reached a great improbable age. You are so old. You remember the last time rain fell in goo spec, and the tarpaulins were holed out and spread with love over things that might otherwise have got wet. And so on the outskirts of what once was goose back, in vegetation and in or we make a handshake last two hours, as dusk descend you back to your hotel, and I turn and return to the ruins. I should Coco.

This next piece, unlike the previous ones was written 10 years ago when bird flu was there was a lot of bird flu as the deadly bird flu virus sweeps inexorably westward, France is the latest country to report a case. It is vitally important that you take preventative measures to ensure your pets one or swans do not fall victim to the virus. If you act in time, your Swan will not have to be cold by a Wellington booted government official with a gun or some poison pellets. The simplest way to save the life of your Swan is to lower it indoors and keep it there. If you do so, the virus can lay waste all outdoor birdlife for as far as you can see, but your indoor Swan will be snug and secure. So long as you batten down the hatches and allow no other birds into your house. There will be no point keeping your Swan indoors. If you then invite in any passing Eagle chaffinch vulture Starling or peewit. I'm assuming for the purposes of this advisory note that you have only one swan. If you have two or more pets ones, you will find the technique outlined here. equally effective.

swans are independent minded birds are no matter how devoted a swankivy you are. They will always prefer to glide up and down on the river, or like looking graceful and showing off their beautiful profiles than to be housebound and cloistered. You might think it's a simple matter of plucking your Swan from the water, tucking it under your arm, carrying it indoors and putting it on the sofa. Do try to remember, however, that swans can be very aggressive. Next time you're with your swan. Look at it. Look at it. Look at his face very close to and tell me if you do not see a cold, hard alien savagery. You are probably thinking that you're luring your Swan indoors is a simple matter of laying a trail of breadcrumbs and millet or other seeds from the edge of the lake, across the muddy field and in through your front door to the living room. Not so most However famished will balk bulk entering a building, they will pack eagerly away until I get to the door, but then almost certain to turn around and return to the like chanting that more food will appear before long, and it will, you can be sure that canice won't be lured indoors by placing a decoist one in your living room. This is possible, but your decoyed must be thoroughly convincing. It not only needs to look like a swan and sound like a swarm, but ideally it should smell like a swarm to you're not going to succeed by bundling up some old neck curtains blackening a portion with charcoal to resemble the head and covering in weeds dragged from the lake. Your Swan will take one count Petter was looking at it, turn round on waddled back to the lake, possibly wondering to bite your hand as it leaves. What you need to do if you were to have an indoor Swan safe from bird flu, is to make your living room a more attractive environment for it than its usual like pond or river habitat. This is where a bank of loudspeakers and a tape loop of music by Sir Peter Maxwell Davis comes in. The master of the Queen's music is well known for his Swan eating habits. And those same Swan wants to be boiled and gobbled down for dinner, whether by an important contemporary composer or by a tone deaf in great like you. swans have a collective unconscious that baffles ornithologists. And ever since Peter Maxwell Davis found on electrocuted whooper Swan and took it back to his kitchen. His music strikes terror into their palpitating swarm hearts. The non stop racket for example of excuse me, the non stop racket of for example, the yellow cake review 1980 played at the top volume in the vicinity of the pond will soon have your Swan seeking shelter. By angling the loudspeakers correctly, you can make your living room The Haven the poor panic stricken Swan yearns for you will of course need to keep the music piping across the pond until such time as the government announces an all clear but that's the least of your worries. The important thing is that your swarm will be safe.

This is a quotation from the burglars fight and the detectives by Alan Pinkerton. I think that's the Pinkerton new formed Pinkerton detective agency. If his experiences of the previous evening had been distressing, the breakfast which was set before him, was positively heart rending, a muddy looking liquid, which is a cold coffee, soggy biscuits, a beef steak that would rival in toughness, a piece of baked gutta percha, and evidently swimming in lard and potatoes, which gave decided tokens of having been served on more than one previous occasion. With a smothered grown, he attacked the unsavory VMs and by dint of great effort, managed to appease his hunger to the serious to arrangement of his digestive organs.

I am gluten free, dry Burning Man and I drop her in the corridors of power, like a L'Oreal product. I am armed with light reflecting booster technology. I use it wisely and do not abuse advantage it gives me how easy it would be for me for me to take a Member of Parliament like Lembit opik say, or dawn Primarolo and not only boost the light reflecting off them, but jabber at them until they too are gluten free. I could have I wish do the same with captains of industry, media moguls, big players in the world of sport with anyone you care to mention, who has even the tiniest smidgen of power and influence in the world. I have often been tempted to wreak my weird magic on Lionel Richie for example. And yet I restrained myself. Now I just do the jabbering, a quiet sort of jabbering and I drive out only at the little bugs and creepy crawlies that scurry unnoticed in the corridors of power. unnoticed that is by all but me and by the pest controllers, to whom I refrain from jabbering. Even with my light reflecting booster technology. I suspect they would outwit me with their fearsome engines of destruction. There sprays and raise and fumes and beams are covered such weaponry, but it would be too dangerous in my hand. And in any case, I am the personification of mercy. And I am replete.

Last week I had an extraordinarily stroke of good fortune. Ever since the afternoon of Friday mast I've been engulfed in a flood of memories and I'm discombobulated under devere quite unlike my usual self. I was wandering the streets of pointy town somewhat aimlessly, and as I turned a particular corner, I felt compelled there's no other word for it to head off down a dark narrow alleyway where looks strange little shop. Do you remember the scene towards the end of random harvest 1942 where Charles Rainier, played by Ronald Coleman turns down a side street to go to a tobacconist and then wonders how he knew it was there. This being a town he's never knowingly visited before, and how his consternation is the spur to his gradual recollection of the life that a traffic accident has wiped from his memory, leading within a few minutes of film time to the tear Stein scene, where he and Paula Greer Garson are reunited at the gates of their idyllic country cottage. Well, as I entered the shop in that pointy town alleyway, I had a very similar jolt to my memory. Although I'm not a veteran of the First World War, whose shell shock could lead to total amnesia, and a reluctance to speak like Charles Ramya. listeners who have no idea what I'm gathering all about should take steps to see this magnificent film at the earliest opportunity. I guaranteed that even those with the flimsiest of heart will be sobbing copious Lee by the end, not that hooting yars listeners tend to be flinty hearted as a general rule, according to the latest listenership profiles gathered by Fatima Gilley, Blatt and her team of waterfalls. The shot into wit God tottered, having tripped on a thing discarded in the alleyway was not a tobacconist. It was called I noted this veil of tears, and it's unexpectedly neon bright interior contained a hetero jumble of items for sale. I can only call them on demand. battered biscuit tins, dish cloth on utensils have no apparent utility bags full of Swan feathers, rubber inhaling cube dog eared snapshots of goat pigs and barnyard animals in general. buckets and pails, packets of cupcake mixture, farm overs, fawn over slings from the stage production of tappable spigot, fruit made out of wax, foldout wiring diagrams, wiring, trees, cloth, pastry cases, bound copies of the propeller, abandoned and in some cases broken sandwich board, a stuffed crow litmus paper, human hair braided into rope for ships, surgery ready canisters Pin cushions, talk IQ lamps, Fahrenheit converters, big forks, rotating wooden cubes on a spindle, frozen blobs and information poster showing the correct pronunciation of yogurt. That is your hot tassels, baubles and bells, some of them enormous bells from a famous foundry annals of jurisprudence, kitchen whisks repair kits for the irrepairable teaspoons bazi pan clock springs, greasing balls, a fanatic for a marble bust of the head of Ringo Starr lanterns, rattles, fripperies saws, starched white butchers curtains, and they're in among it all still in his dust cake packaging, but otherwise pristine and original series oglesby's steering panel. Were you lucky enough when you were a tiny tot to receive an August visa steering panel as a birthday gift? I was. I still remember with absolute clarity, waking on the icy cold morning of my 10th birthday. And finding at the foot of my bed, a rectangular object wrapped in old newspaper on which other my father or my mother had scribbled in crayon. Happy birthday to our 10 year old. I was a dutiful pious child. So before tearing the package open, I repaired to the bathroom to brush my teeth and plunged my head into a sink full of icy water. And then I went downstairs to find my parents. My mother was in the garden slaughtering insects. I thanked her for my gift and asked where my father was taught. I could thank him too.

She gave me a Wobegon look and patted me on the head, massing my hair in which icicles were beginning to form. I'm afraid your father had to take the dawn train to the secret military establishment at an undisclosed coastal location. towering cliffs monstrous waves shingle, where he will be cooped up for the next six months, helping to devise counterintelligence techniques for you to get an enemy so powerful, so ruthless, so fiendish that it beggars belief, said my mother, and she tapped the side of her nose, indicating that this startling news was to be kept under my hat. Had I better hat to keep it under? Gosh, I replied. So part is not as he appears to all and sundry a simple village potato shop person that is bought a cover for his real work, which is of national, no international importance. Well, I never It is indeed so said my mother. And as it's your birthday, I'm going to make a present to you have a hat and you must promised like the dreadful and pious child you are to keep this world shattering revelation underneath it until you reach your majority. I will do so mama I promised her mentioned of a present record my mind to the rectangular package at the foot of the bed. It seemed unlikely that it contained a hat. It was as if my mother read my thoughts. The hat is an extra gift treated for your proper present is the one in the rectangular newspaper wrapped package at the foot of your bed. Go and open it now and leave me to my slaughter of aphids.

Frank Key  28:51
I ran upstairs and tore open the rectangular newspaper wrapped package at the foot of my bed. Is it possible to convey to you the sheer joy with which my entire being was convulsed? When I saw that I had been given an original series oglesby's steering panel. And we're going to continue with that piece next week because there isn't time to read the rest of it today. I missed time things but you know that's okay. Doesn't matter. I'll be back next week with more about the August be steering battle. Bye bye
