But Rob track he said, half my master sent me design master and to the to speak these words. Has he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they might eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you. Then Rab Shockers stood and cried with a loud voice in the Choose language, and said, Here ye the words of the Great King, the king of Assyria. Lastly, last saith the king, let not has a chi or deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you. Neither let has a chi or make you trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely Deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. hearken not to Hezekiah For thus saith the king of Assyria. Make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree and drink tea every one the waters of his own system until I come and take you away. I beg your pardon. I didn't realize the time I was declaiming, as I so often do from one of the books of the Old Testament, the book of Isaiah. And I didn't realize it was time for hooting yd on the air. Sorry, this is me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. And it's hosting out on the air back in the studio on Bara High Street after a period in the in a large vaults in the Science Museum and tell you I'm so out of practice I was I was babbling from the book from the book of Isaiah, instead of keeping an eye on the clock so that I get on with the show. And here's here's a piece of prose, not from the Bible. One windy September morning, tiny Enid read in her daily newspaper that a big volcano might be about to erupt. volcano ology was not her strong point. But some of the comments quoted in the story made her set up with a start. A number of scientists from organizations with the fuddling acronyms said things like it looks like it will erupt soon and we have recorded volcanic activity. Tiny Enid scoured the paper to see if there were any other signs or portents, such as unusual locust swarm formations, but there were none. Yet her mind was made up both, she packed a bag with pythons hammers, extra socks, and a flask of her secret Alex here. She left instructions for the milk delivery person and the topia wrist and called the taxi. The taxi took her from her house to the railway station, where she boarded a train to the port from where a small boat rounded the coastline to that part of the land where there was an airfield. Tiny Enid had allowed her pilot's pilot's license to expire, so she paid a man with a decisive mustache and a flying cap to take the controls of the little two seater pangloss diesel plane and flew into the wild blue yonder, with gritted teeth and blazing eyes. Tiny Enid never wore goggles when flying. She thought that a sign of moral dereliction Tawny, Enid, never let a day pass without reading a few pages of the imitation of Christ by Thomas a campus. Indeed, she kept a ragged copy of this devotional classic in her bag at all times. It's true that the Augustinian monk has nothing to say on the subject of flying goggles, given that he was wrong In the 1420s, and it's hard for us to comprehend how tiny Enid arrived at her interpretation.

It is hard and also unwise, for no less than a dozen harmless souls have gone crackers trying to correlate the contents of tiny in his brain by language now in places of shutter relinquishment, although it is too tiny in its credit that she pays for their keep, including porridge for breakfast, and a nurse who mops their brows. Thomas a campus suggests chapter 50 that, quote, the desert to man should place himself in God's hands, unquote. And tiny Enid agrees, but she has to have a sense of her responsibility. Although these 12 men tried to make sense of a cerebral fumes and vapors, uninvited, that does not stop her doing what she can for them. When the pangloss landed at the foot of the volcano, tiny Enid, Enid clambered out, she put on extra socks and ascended the volcano using her pylons and hammers. When she reached the summit, she found a pair of perilous vents, in which molten magma was bubbling and boiling, ready to erupt, just like the scientists had said. She also saw a great deal of tephra in the form of rocks and cinders ashes and dust, as if they had already been as if they had already been a mini eruption. Posing only to scan the sky for birds. Tiny Ingrid extinguished the volcano, using a technique she had read about in the Reader's Digest. Then she started on the long journey home, whistling, and only a little muddy.

Here's another piece of prose, again, not from the Bible. Captain Baxter made one last desperate attempt to adjust the Hooters knobs and boosters on the console. For God's sake, man, the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese is in a state of flux. He screamed, but it was too late. 10 days earlier, it all seemed so simple. Captain Baxter had been summoned to the Admiralty on a hot Tuesday morning. The place was swarming with admirals, but by asking a series of increasingly astute questions, he tracked down the admiral he had come to see. Right just ranked Admiral o hoolahan, with a full on and tawdry man, and Baxter found him lurking in a corner of his office where the light never penetrated. He hissed at the captain to join him there. I'm glad you could come back stir. For months now. I've been getting intelligence reports about a certain matter that I don't mind telling you has frozen the blood in my veins. That's why I skulk in corners. He shuddered. I skulk and as you can see, I shudder you will to Baxter. If you knew what I know about a certain matter, I know you shall soon enough, I'm sending you on a mission. Captain Baxter's nose began to bleed, but he staunched it with a large rectangular pad of cotton wall. It's lucky for you. I am not a vampire, said the admiral mysteriously. His suit was cheap. His his great prominent flaps the color of death. These shoes had been ordered by weasels, I think lacked backbone. That was why he needed Baxter. Baxter's backbone was the talk of the Admiralty. Not just canteen gossip, but the subject Secret memoranda, bulging dossiers and meetings attended by every single Admiral in the building, all crammed into Oh hooligans sunless refuge, jostling for space. Baxter knew nothing of this. He knew a lot about ships, rigging, cables, hoses, decks, both poop and all up dinghies, or the fuse into which was a slotted and many other topics of maritime significance.

it would be no easy task, but he kissed the admirals forehead as a sign that he accepted it. I hoolahan wedged himself ever further into the corner, as Baxter took his leave striding across the filthy office, and placing his blood soaked rectangular pad of cotton wool into a basket before closing the door gently behind him. Little Did either of them know that in 10 days time, the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese would be in a state of flux. And Baxter would face a peril greater than death itself.

While I was at the Science Museum, those of you who were listening to those shows will know that each week while they're appropriately, I read extracts from further science book 20 by Norman Davis, published in 2001, a small pamphlet which is possibly the greatest book ever written, and I have previously read bits of it on the show over many years. And I've also asked if anyone has got copies of further science books one through to number 19 or 21 and beyond, I would be most grateful.

After breakfast, I did a quick set of botsman exercises second handbook and then I hoisted my rucksack onto my back and strode manfully off to the countryside to look at all the bloomin the lake next to the decoys airfield with full of decoy ducks. For the first time I noticed a shabby clapboard heart which, according to the sign on its roof was selling items of stationery at bargain prices. I strode manfully across the verdant meadows, stepping on innumerable bloomin as I went and pushed my way into the tenebrous interior of the heart. Were in Sasha Crone sharpening a pencil. Hail Crone. I cried. Hail wayfaring rucksack person yelled the Crone. Definitely. I was disconcerted from her with an old body festooned in noise some rags, pipe the voice of a youngster. I've wondered with a start, if my manful strides had led me inadvertently into the spooky land of God, reputed to be teeming with imps and sprites, spider guns and changelings, and with things that should not be. But I had faced peril before, and I had eaten the large breakfast. quick thinking has always been my trademark. So I nipped out of the hat and uprooted A Fistful of Calla Lilies to give to the Crone. If he was a malevolent being from a parallel universe, the bloomin would appease her. And if he was bought a crown, there would be no harm done. Hi, uh, once more Crone, I declaimed, skipping back into the heart here have these Calla Lilies to brighten up your hovel. The Crown accepted my gift graciously, actually reached critically to take the bloomin a slight dis arrangement of her rags revealed the source of her arrestingly youthful voice. Wires trailed from her sleeve, and following their path across the floor. I saw that she was attached to the standard karpin voicebox. mischievously I turned the dial to us vice presidents setting so when next the crown spoke she would sound exactly like Spyro Agnew. I was about to ask the price of pencil sharpeners when a shelduck scudded into the heart. At least I thought at least I thought it was a shelduck it may have been a tale. its arrival sent the Crone into a frenzy of terror. I had to turn down the volume on the voice box so loudly did she scream. The tail or shelduck glared at her with uncanny purple eyes. And she carried on screaming there was little I could do. My training never prepared me to deal with terrifying ducks. Not that I was scared of the tail or shelduck myself You understand? I fear nothing anymore. Not even those recurring nightmares I have about buttons, for I have been following botsman second handbook for five years. That's why I'm able to stride manfully about the countryside, trampling on the bloomin without a care in the world. I picked up a pencil sharpener and placed a handful of coins in its place. The Crone still screamed, the duck still stared. I left the heart and was blinded by the sun, bathing the field in an unearthly light. As I approached gruesome dick, and my eyes adjusted, I saw that all the Blue Moon had vanished without trace, and no birds did sing.

Drones just pointed out that what I should have said then was and no birds do see. My argument is that as everything else in the pieces in the past tense, I think, then that's why I said did instead of do just time for one more piece today is of course of decisive importance that I tell you about bloodroot esque farming methods. The techniques pioneered by Blodgett in his heyday are breathtaking. Consider, for example, the uses to which your blonde jetty and farmer will put high there are many many diagrams in the manual which show bales of hay being commended for all sorts of inventive purposes all over the farmyard in all six seasons of the year. That's right, six seasons. One of Blodgett Most telling innovations was his calendar trickle recalibration if I'm using the word correctly. out go winter, spring, summer and autumn or fall as they say in pining and potholes land. Income tally spite, the time of Mighty remonstrations tak, hub and bullies mus so comm hub comm haywain as the saying goes with his big fat boots stuffed with straw. I mean, hey, we will not get diverted from this important essay by wandering down the byways of blue jetty and countryside parlance. But I cannot resist sharing with you the rhyme that goes Don't forget to shut the gate on the 43rd of spite. The meaning of which is obvious, as you would realize had you seen as I have an implacable army of our Beto hens marching off into the sunset, because little verkin Garrick the barnyard hubballi. hoyts, was too busy chewing on a sheaf of fronds to remember to close the gate behind him. As it happened, the fronds were poisonous and the miscreant was subject to convulsive fits for the next three weeks blessing. As with Hi, so with mulch blodger test mulch is a thing of beauty, even if it does stink. Have you ever seen asparagus grown in Blodgett mulch? You would remember if you had for it is so it is too common everyday asparagus as a big shiny supersonic 26th century spice rocket is to a shred of plankton. Preparation of mulch takes place mostly in polyphemus when the winds how and thunderclap shatter the eardrums of toiling farmworkers, Hardy folk with almost inhuman musculature as a result of regular doses of Blodgett serum, the recipe for which appears in an appendix to the manual. To begin farming the Blodgett way, all you will need is a how a shapeless hat on determination and your own field, preferably one with a pond in it, and ducks in the pond mergansers or tail, some of them real, some of them would carve decoyed ducks, and some of them just vaporous specters of your own imagining imagine those decoyed ducks now and you can imagine them until next week show when I'll be back with some more stuff and possibly some more further science. Some further further science. And no birds do sing. Bye bye.
