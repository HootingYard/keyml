Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. I seem to have developed in the last 24 hours a streaming head cold. So, I will try to zip through the program without sneezing, choking, coughing and generally collapsing on the studio floor. Anyway, I got a letter Dear Mr. Key, right Zippy blanket. I recently stumbled upon your hooting yard website and so enthralling did I find it that using clever speed reading techniques? I have read the entire content dating back to 2003. In a matter of hours. What has particularly impressed me is your tremendous erudition on the subject of birds. I have always been interested in ornithology passionately So, but my knowledge of the subject is scant and flimsy. I can honestly say I have learned more through speed reading your work than from any other birdie source at which I have sapped to put it poetically. Yes, Mr. Key, I confess I am something of a poet. The reason I'm being so bold as to write to you is that I'm currently working on a sonnet sequence about little stint. I know almost nothing of the little stint. But I read carefully your postage the other day, where you gave in a footnote, an explanation of the term unstinting. In other words, not involving a little stint, I would be enormously grateful if you could expand upon this and perhaps share with a poor, classy and diversifier your boundless knowledge of this tiny wading bird. You will sincerely Zippy blanket. I often receive letters from bird ignorant readers in all of my avian learning. Usually I cast them straight into the pneumatic waste shoot, because quite frankly, if I reply to them all, I never get any other work done. And our feathered friends are just one teensy weensy fragment among my many and varied interests, which also include the Kennedy assassination, the Hindenburg, disaster, eggs and bees to name for. It so happened however, that Miss blankets letter popped through the letterbox, just as I was putting the finishing touches to my new book, crush your business rivals by unleashing your inner little stint. This is the first in a series of management guides for top CEOs, which I hope will be bestsellers in the burgeoning market for management guides for top CEOs. Unfortunately for Zippy, however, I've already signed a contract with a global publishing concern, specializing in management guides for top CEOs. Under the terms of which I'm unable to reproduce any of the text on the hooting yard website or read it aloud on resonance. The book itself will contain 99% of my knowledge of the little stint. So all I'm able to do here to help out to the fledgling poetess is to cobble together a few dribs and drabs that didn't quite make it into my manuscript. Under no circumstances must you confuse the littles didn't with 10 links didn't try to remember the wise old rustic saying. When it comes to stints, there are two words, the literal and timing are different birds.

Frank Key  04:22
Having said that, matters are confused further by the fact that not only are there two words for the two different stints, but there are dozens of other words for the little stint itself, depending on where you are in the world. For example, you will be making a basic error if in some other alien distant land out on a bird spotting expedition with your powers laws and prudence. You point your finger and shout, look, laws and prudence a little stint. What you ought to shout assuming you know where you are. Look, laws and prudence are followed by one of the following terms.

Frank Key  07:41
suspect there might have been some terrible mispronunciations in that last piece, for which I apologize. So please don't write in to complain. On the other hand, if you'd like to send in a tape of yourself, saying the word for a little stint in the correct pronunciation, I'd be happy to play on the show next week. I got another letter from the Zippy blanket the very, very next day. Before I read that, one thing I need to point out to you is that she refers to the feeding of a pig type. And for those of you unclear, the pig type is similar to a tapeworm. And whereas the tapeworm spends its time in your intestinal tract, as far as I know, feeding on nutriments there in the pig type resides in the human soul and nourishes itself on spiritual matters. Dear Mr. Key, right Zippy blanket again, thank you very much for the helpful information about the little stint. I now wish to raise a completely unrelated matter. I read with great interest your Pete on the feeding of a pig tape and I find myself in something of a quandary. I would very much like to obtain a pet pig tape for my tiny infant Bathsheba. But I have been Excuse me. I would very much like to obtain a pet pig tape for my tiny infant Bathsheba. But I have been told in no uncertain terms by a number of religious and spiritual authorities that she does not have a soul. One particularly forbidding Jesuit, announced in a booming voice. That little Bathsheba is the spawn of the devil. Apparently, it is rare for a baby to be born with vivid markings resembling the number 666. emblazoned the top this girl now, she's some six He is of age her hair has grown and the markings are no longer visible. But father tongue lash SJ says this makes no difference. spawn of the devil or no, it does seem to be the case that Bathsheba is soulless, for innards have been examined with probes plunges X ray scanners and geo thermal imaging systems and in among all with bones and veins and tissue and sinew and liver and light etc. There is indeed no sign of anything resembling a soul, which as we know, is about the size and shape and color of a plum tomato, though intangible and shimmering and glorious and immortal in a way that a plum tomato is not that being so Bathsheba has no suitable home in which a pink tape might nest, but I so want her to have one, especially now if he's going to kindergarten. You know what children are like, and I fear she will be teased mercilessly. Please let me know if there any is any advice you can give a poor adult parent at this difficult time. Yours even more sincerely than yesterday. Zippy blanket well Zippy, I suggest you ignore the Jesuits and just go ahead and buy a pig type for your daughter. Most town let's have a pig type supplier, usually located down one of the less salubrious alleyways near the railway station. Pig types may need a few days to a climatized themselves to their new environment. Set aside a small Nook or cranny in your home to settle the pig type in and before bringing it home. Lay out plenty of newspaper and throw the windows open. Place in the NACA small box or carton lined with a scrap of fabric taken from a piece of clothing worn by its new owner. In this case, Bathsheba.

Frank Key  12:02
Some wool from one of her bonnets would be ideal to help the pink tape get used to new surroundings. Avoid making loud noises or sudden movements in the vicinity of the carton. When it has had a few days to adjust. You can introduce it to battery but gently for two or three minutes at a time. If he is cluttering in her little fist, a leaf of lettuce or radish or some breadcrumbs, all the better. It's also a good idea to put out a saucer in which you can pull the dregs from a can of sculpture. But make sure Bathsheba doesn't lap this up herself. After a few days or weeks or months, or in some cases even years. The pig type will be thoroughly at home and will creep grunting to it permanent nest or STI when you're not looking.

Frank Key  13:19
Dear Mr key right Zippy blanket yes again, forgive me for writing to you yet again. But I think you may be able to help tackle a massive and debilitating psychological trauma which has affected me for the best part of my life. In my speed reading of the entire hooting yard cannon I noticed that you heard included two statements of particulars by famed Archer and the man of Switzerland. William Tell. At the end of the second statement, her towel promises a third statement in which he will address the subject of sausages in Switzerland. But this third statement has never seen the light of day. I cannot imagine why you would put the kibosh on such a text, so can only ascribe the non appearance of the statement to forgetfulness on your part. Having said that, if you've had to suppress it for reasons to do with seamlessness or national security, I quite understand and I will leave you alone, and instead right to the lovely Julian Assange currently languishing imprisoned in an agreeable English country house. I'm sure he will be able to unearth William tells third statement of particulars for me. Perhaps I have to explain why I have a burning desire to read it. You see, when I was young Amir tritt I begged my parents, Mr. And Mrs. blanket to take me to Switzerland to see the gnomes of Zurich. I was fascinated by gnomes at the time having read a children's edition of Rudolf steiners book Theosophy, an introduction to the supersensible knowledge of the world and the destination of man 1910 wherein the sage writes of invisible gnomes among other fantastic beings, imperceptible to the senses of ordinary lumpen proles. I was keen to commune with the gnomes of Zurich and badgered my parents incessantly. Now, my Mamaw and papaw were great admirers of the big fat spider, Harold Wilson. I knew that he had coined the phrase gnomes of Zurich in 1956 as a pejorative term for Swiss bankers. They knew in other words, that they weren't actual gnomes, invisible or otherwise to be found in that fair city. But rather than telling me the truth, they decided to teach me a hard lesson. Driven half insane by my unceasing and whiny demands, they whisked me off to Zurich. As a tender age to tender I would learn to be crushed by disappointment, and have it driven home to me that our political leaders, even the big fat spidery ones can be monsters of mendacity, unlike say, lovely Julian Assange, who carries the shining torch of truth at all times, and in all circumstances. It was that trip to anomalous Zurich, which led to the massive and debilitating psychological trauma I mentioned earlier. Now to the reason I'm desperate to read William Telford statement of particulars. On the third day of our visit, by which time I had become a wailing and screeching bundle of fractious hysteria, mama and papa tried to appease me by taking me to a butcher shop. Perhaps they thought the site of raw meat and blood and then trails and huge sharp cleavers and slices and glistening knives, and the butcher's apron soaked in gore would shut me up, as indeed it did, but for quite an unexpected reason. our visit to the shop coincided with a sausage tasting Gala. I which chunks of a variety of sausages from every canton of Switzerland were presented on paper plate. The Butcher's apprentice stood there in a puddle of I think it was balls blood, handing out the paper plates to all comers.

Frank Key  17:36
As I was still bawling and screeching at the absence of gnomes, my papar stifled my cries by plucking from a paper plate a chunk of Swiss sausage and cramming it into my gob. As I bent down on it in voluntarily, I caught a fugitive glimpse of a hitherto invisible known standing slap bang next to the butcher's apprentice. I swallowed the mouthful, and the gnome vanished. Without having the manners to ask. I snatched a second chunk of sausage from papayas paper plate and sank my girly fangs into it. Alas, it was a different type of Swiss sausage, and the invisible gnome failed to reappear. I proceeded to scoffers many free sausage samples as I could, but to no avail. That first bite of that first sausage was the only one that revealed the gnome to me. Two hours later, the butcher announced that the gala was over, and we were turfed out into the street. The next day, we left Zurich forever. In the year since I have been trying to find out exactly what kind of sausage it was that made visible to me. Oh, so briefly, the magical world of invisible gnomes, of which Rudolf Steiner so super sensibly wrote, I have haunted butcher shops from here to kingdom come and taken bites out of thousands of sausages. Not all of them Swiss. Not all of them even cooked, but never yet have I again seen that Zurich butcher is no nor one of his kind. So you can imagine the excitement with which I read that art of repute and a man of Switzerland. William Tell, in his third statement of particulars would address the subject of sausages. As far as I'm aware, we have nothing on record to suggest that her towel ever communed with knowns. But I feel laughably confident that I will be able to winnow from his saucy DRI, some significant clue. I need to read that damn statement of particulars. Mr. Key, please oblige yours yet again. Zippy blanquette. I'm afraid I must inform Zippy that The document she's so keen to read was stolen from the hooting yard Data Silo, by a ragamuffin in the pay of lovely lovely Julian Assange. Lovely Julian has not seen fit to release William Telford statement of particulars, I understand, because it contains compromising details about lovely Julian himself, the kinds of sordid details which will never ever be placed in the public domain. The mind boggles at the mental image of William Tell, aiming his bow as a Swiss sausage atop the lovely head of lovely Julian Assange. And it surely better that a veil is drawn over the whole squalid business, saris Zippy.
