Good evening resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com if you're listening on a digital electronic device of some kind, my name is Frankie. This is hooting yard on the air like the leaf clings to the tree. Oh, my darling, cling to me, for we are like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind. Wild is the wind. Wild it is. as wild as the wind in the wind starring Lillian Gish, this wild wind house across the desert top Buta, so my you must cling to me, my darling and I must cling to these railings and are clinging yours to me and mine to the railings will prevent us being blown away like specks of dust in the wild wind. I cling to the railings surrounding the huge cement hollyhock that is the only landmark for miles and miles across the desert top pooter it is the work of the noted cement hollyhocks just Sydney Hawk though the ravings of municipal when unveiled so many moons ago, it was painted or green and pink and Crimson with emotion. But the relentless wild wind has stripped it of its paint and now it is a bear cement hollyhock towering on the top pooter a handy landmark were such as we can arrange our acid nations for we are like creatures of the wind. Sydney Hawk placed other cement hollyhocks in other locations, but this one is his masterpiece. That is why it is protected by railings. They are stout and strong the railings, the better to withstand the wild wind. I cling to them now. As you cling to me as the wind rules. We cannot hear each other speak. But what uses speak the cement hollyhocks just with himself a mute by dint of some unfathomable hysteric blot upon his brain from the age of 10. After a picnic, not a word was heard from his mouth. He had a great feeling for the top pooter for its desolation, for the wild winds that rolls across it, flattening everything except the enormous cement hollyhock which looms above us as we clean. Here we can conduct our acid nations safe from the premon priggish villagers in their broad brimmed hats and black frock coats. We shall not skulking alleyways and shadow out here on the top pooter in the Howling Wind, we cling me to the railings, and you to me, like the leaf clings to the tree.

Gosh, that was moving, wasn't it? Um, I ended last week's show, as far as I recall, with a couple of words of the day. As far as I recall, I will pop and boggle and we're going to catch up with word of the day we're going to have I've got a word of the day Omnibus in the next five or 10 minutes. But I'm actually going to go back and begin with the two I read last week, because that will give the context and you might not have heard last week's show. So anyway, well we'll we'll recap on the first two words of the day, and then we'll move on to several new words of the day. Word of the Day. Power PARP is a verb, pretty much identical to tuite. Here is an illustrated sentence. In an apoplexy of rage, he popped his hooter to act out this sentence. For example, in a classroom full of tops, you will need a hooter You should also smear your face with beetroot juice to give it that purple with rage look and be able to boggle your eyes convincingly. Tomorrow, we will consider the word boggle. Well, of course you don't have to wait until tomorrow because we're doing all our words of the day, one after another. But I just need to access where I have the details of boggle so hold on with me for one moment. This is a live radio at its best. Wittering nonsense. Yes, Word of the Day boggle. I'm afraid that before we move on to boggle we have unfinished business with yesterday's Word of the Day pop reader and the listener will add owner new group writes dear word my stroke. I am confused by your monitorings on the word pop. You say it is pretty much identical to toot. But then proceed in your illustrative sentence to refer to a hooter rather than as I might have expected a tutor or papa. My mental chaos is compounded by the fact that you also make mention of tots, virtually the same word as toots they are entirely different in meaning. I look forward to improving my word power with your new series. Instead, I find myself quite dreadfully unhinged. Mr. Owner nugo will find it helpful to consult Dobson's pamphlet, pop to hooter tutors poppers and tops, a complete guide for the bewildered out of print. I have not read it myself, but I'm told it's almost but not quite the greatest pamphlet ever written.

Frank Key  07:38
Word of the Day, clunk. I had hoped today to deal with the word clunk as well as catching up with yesterday's word boggle, which, as you recall, had to be postponed, while I addressed further matters regarding pop. At last, I am diverted for my proper course by another letter from will add owner new guru. This time he writes. Dear Mr. Key, I was touched by your thoughtfulness in recommending to me further reading on the knotty problem of pop and toot and hooter on top, etc. Indeed, I was so touched that I'm afraid to say I let a few tears run down my cheeks. My weeping and snuffling, soon ceased, however, when the significance of those parents medical words, out of print, appended to the recommended title sank him. Sure enough, as I trudged around the book selling kiosks of the dilapidated seaside resort where I live. I discovered that this Dobson pamphlet was completely unavailable. I was met with blank stares, looks of incredulity, a pitying pat on the head, and by one particularly apoplectic bookseller, the threat of his slobbering sharp fangs guard dog. Eventually, at a jumble sale at the local self esteem and diversity awareness hub, my rummaging did on Earth a pamphlet by Dobson. a glance at the standard cover, however, revealed that it was devoted to a wholly different topic. The title was several potentates of the ancient world with collapsed lungs, and their concubines out of print. I bought it anyway for tuppence and took it home hoping that perhaps the pamphleteer might have a passing word to say somewhere about the whole pop to hooter top business. arriving home I snapped open or refreshing kind of squelch Joe plopped myself down in my armchair and began to read shortly thereafter. I was weeping again. But this time from brain jangling frustration, the pamphlet seemed to me the most utter poppycock and try as I might, I could ring no sense from it whatsoever. If this is a typical example of Dobson's work, I am feeling quite relieved that I did not continue my search for the pamphlet you recommended. Please send me a postal order that happens as compensation. Well, I'm sorry that Mr. Owner new guru found Dobson's prose intractable. There is a possibility, however, that he may well have stumbled upon a copy of the notorious rogue addition of several potentates of the ancient world with collapsed lungs, and their concubines. This was the one where the original text, a model of shining clarity and dobsonian was translated into Hungarian and from Hungarian into Tagalog, and from Tagalog into dog Latin, before being translated back into English. It was the work of the mischievous literary prankster Hector nuisance. Tomorrow, I hope to crack on with boggle and flunk. And tomorrow's word of the day, glue.

Frank Key  11:54
Word of the Day glue. Today, I want to look at the word glue. I also want to take the opportunity to mop up the two earlier words of the day. I have not yet had a chance to examine boggle and clunk. mop incidentally is a fine word in itself. So let's pencil that in for tomorrow. And while we're about it, let's pencil in pencil for the day after tomorrow. In the meantime, I have received yet another letter from will add own Enugu I presume it's another bit of whispering about pop. I cannot say for sure because with iron in my soul, I have thus far by the Titanic effort not to open it and thus have not yet read it.

Frank Key  12:49
Perhaps I never will. I might shove it unopened into my wastepaper basket from whence it will be tipped along with all sorts of other papery detritus into a great roaring furnace. When I have located such a furnace. I ought to make it clear that it's not my habit to treat all correspondence from listeners, so shamefully. Usually I pour over your letters, rereading them a couple of times, until I've winkled from them every last drop of whatever it is they contain wisdom, wit, top tips, a scattering of breadcrumbs, and then I crew the end of my pencil before scribbling a response. If you take the trouble to write to me, I will take the trouble to reply. So I have terrible misgivings about Mr. Owner new goos latest missive, but quite honestly, if I have to bang on about pop yet again, this series is never going to get anywhere. After I wrote that paragraph, my terrible misgivings got the better of me. And I decided after all to open and read Mr. Owner new goos letter. If it turned out to be all about pop again and today and hooter and thought, then so be it. I would frame a response, which I hope would dissuade my pesky correspondent from ever putting pencil to paper again for so long as he lived. As I reached across my desk for the letter, however, I knocked over an open can of sculpture, from which I had taken only a single, dainty glog with the result that I ended up with a puzzle of fizzy, luminous, highly colored, chemically enhanced liquid on the floor. I was not entirely sure how high its acidic content was, but I feared it might start eating through the floorboard, like the blood of the alien in alien Ridley Scott 1979. So at once I fetched a mop to mop it up. So once I fetched a mop to mop it up, see what a great word mop is. is it's both a noun and a verb, one marks with a mop. And I won't even begin to talk about Beatle here. Anyway, I was so exhausted after my mopping with a mop, that I had to go and take a nap, which means that I'll have to set aside boggle and clunk and glue for another day. On a more positive note, it could be argued that I've already composed An Illustrated sentence for tomorrow's word of the day, mop. Perhaps I can substitute nap for mop tomorrow, wait and see. And in the strange Time Warp, that is the radio. It's already tomorrow, because we're now able to move on with the next word of the day. Which is, mop. mop is the technical term for the stuff that grows on top of a beetle and mop top, as in the illustrated phrase for lovable mop tops who conquered the world. There are other meanings of mop both as a noun and verb. But you know what? I think I've already told you about them out of turn, when I was meant to be telling you about the word glue, as well as boggle and clunk none of which word I was able to give proper attention to because of a flurry of correspondence from pesky reader will add owner new guru. See previous Word of the Day entries to relive the full horror. Speaking of Mr. Owner, new guru, he sent me yet another letter. It arrived while I was writing the paragraph I've just read. Here is what he has to say for himself. Dear Mr. Key, why are you telling us about mob when you said you were going to tell us instead about nap. Also, if I'm keeping proper track of things, were you not meant to be telling us about pencil. I have a few further questions for you regarding pop, as well as tooth and hooter and taught, but I need to marshal my thoughts very carefully before putting pencil to cardboard torn from a packet of breakfast cereal. I confess myself utterly befuddled by Mr. Owner new goos ability to know what I'm writing about before I've even posted it on the hooting yard blog. The awful terrifying thought occurs

Frank Key  17:44
to me that he might be some sort of phantasmal being whose only existence is inside my skull. An emanation of the brain brought on by God knows what. At times like these, it can be helpful to slosh out the years by listening to a few Beatles hits. By the way, if you're not clear what a Beatle is, you will find several references to them on the internet. One word of warning. If your source of Beatle law is the pronouncements on the subject by the late Kenneth Williams. Please note that that Beatle who married an Asiatic woman was not as Williams has it, Ringo Starr.

Frank Key  18:57
And our final word of the day for the time being is pencil. Today we're going to consider in all its ramifications, and from every conceivable angle, the word pencil. Before we do so, however, imagine yourself steaming open my correspondence and with the aid of a flaming torch in the darkness, reading the latest missive to plop onto the key map. Dear Mr. Key, allow me to introduce myself. My name is poppy Nisbett and I am the downstairs neighbor of your pesky cereal Word of the Day correspondent will add owner new glue or should I say I was his downstairs neighbor. I am pleased to say that the upstairs flat is now empty. Mr. Owner nugu having been dragged away very early this morning by a whirling tangle of ruffians dressed in police uniforms. Next stop. Julian's vile, a barren rock far out at sea, from which no convict has ever escaped, and where there are no stationery supplies. You will not be hearing from Mr. O again, that will teach him to spit at one of my kittens in the hallway. I have innumerable kittens, and I also have a great love of words, which is why your Word of the Day series has proved such a tonic. One point I was so damnably careful that I even considered letting Mr. Owner nugu off the hook. I'm not making that call to my powers on the legally questionable abduction team. The spat upon kitten gazed at me plaintively, however, and wiser counsels prevailed. Anyway, to business, I am a very busy woman. So it is only today that I have found the time to enact to the illustrator of sentence you gave for the word pop by clattered into a room full of tots having first smeared my face with beetroot juice and boggled my eyes. I then popped my hooter. I'm pleased to say it was a roaring, or should I say, popping success. When I can find time within my shedule, I intend to act out all the words in your Word of the Day feature, whether or not you provide an illustrated sentence. For verbs, they should pose no serious challenge. As for nouns, I have already resolved to make purchase of a mop and some glue and a pencil, and we'll take it from there. I will not, however, be pestering you with daily letters, keeping you abreast of my doings, as I'm mindful that you only have limited space available for the word of the day. And I appreciate that you must become exasperated when that space is taken up as it is today by foolish Wittering letters from your listeners. I fear I have already prevented you from paying good attention to pencil, thus increasing the backlog of words, which you still need to get to grips with. If you also maintain your dignity as a word of the day just by my reckoning, that backlog includes to hooter tots, boggle, clunk glue, and nap. Perhaps I can be of assistance by performing some sort of stage flummery utilizing all those words at one fell swoop and writing an account of it for you. Then you would be able to put each and every one of them behind you and move on as the Airheads say nowadays. First of all, I must feed my kittens and wipe them free of any neighbors spittle. Yours terrifically poppy Nesbitt. I am most grateful to miss Nesbitt and Sheila white. Her report in recognition of her efforts have decided that the next word of the day will be Nisbett.

Frank Key  23:56
I've got another apart from correspondence from lad. Ooh, new goop, and poppy Nisbett. I also got a letter from Tim thurn. Hi there, Mr. Key, he writes. Every so often over the years you've made mention of a snack or breakfast item called smokers pop tarts. I don't smoke myself. It's a filthy habit and you want to be roundly ashamed of yourself. But I must confess that whenever I read about what I assumed to be popped up specifically designed for smokers, I find myself salivating. It can be quite embarrassing, for I usually read and listen to hooting yd when traveling on public transport. And on more than one occasion, I have been found drooling spittle over a fellow passenger. I have been mistaken for an indigent and beaten about the head with a rolled up copy of The Daily incandescent bus passenger Obviously my response to the world's smokers pop tart is irrational, as if I were a Pavlovian dog. I have been led to delve into my family history to discover whether there is something nameless and awful lurking in my genetic heritage. Thus far, I've gone back as far as the 16th century. without finding anything pertinent, though obviously, there were numerous smokers among my ancestors for time worlds when seemingly everybody smoked all the time. What a disgusting world it was. Anyway, back to the present day, or to be more precise, the recent past the very recent past, actually the Thursday just gone. Although you have not mentioned smokers Pop Tarts for quite a while. I have, as you may have guessed, become obsessed with them. Standing at the bus stop on Thursday morning, wobbling my head gently from side to side and up and down in a futile attempt to empty it of thoughts of you know what, I suddenly felt impelled, as if by some eldritch force to cave into my longings, and to damn well go and buy a packet of smokers Pop Tarts, and Wolf them down there and then do you know what? I could not find a single shop in the great metropolis of pointy town that sold them? I tried bakeries, pastry shops, General grocers, supermarkets, hypermarkets, corner shops, super hypermarkets, charity shops, snack bars, picnic shops, and many another type of shop. And from each one, I've talked about empty handed, and increasingly desperate. Also, I missed my bus. I realize I'm on the verge of do Lally dumb, if not already there, and that the proper response to that terrible morning would have been to plunge my head repeatedly into a bucket of ice water, and then have a lie down in a darkened room for several days. A sensible man would have done that, but I am no longer a sensible man. That is why I'm writing to you imploring you, but seeking you like a grubby mendicant sprawled at the feet of a potentate, to provide me with the recipe so I can make my own smokers popped out in my own kitchen and stuff them down my job until I am sick. That I think Mr. Key is my one remaining hope on this earth. Yours in extremists, Tim Fern. Tim might find it helpful to track down a copy of Dobson's pamphlet, how to make your own packet of half a dozen smokers Pop Tarts for tap and take me out of print. It is many years now since I have seen a copy. But as I recall, the pamphleteer gives a jaunty account of his own mucking about in the kitchen with stuff like flour and Sue it and duck pond water and rolling pins and greaseproof paper. And the Lord knows what else

Frank Key  28:33
there's little more than a minute and a bit left. But you know what, we've got time for an old folk song before we say goodbye from hooting yard for the before the summer break. So without further ado, this is the shoveler of Widdecombe ditch, shovel a shovel or what do you shovel by shovel the muck outside my hovel, shovel a shovel or lay down your spade? Let us go tiptoe through verdant Glade. Not only ordinary for shovel I must the muck and the filth and the pebbles and dust I must shovel it all into Widdecombe dick and cover it with tar and pick shovel a shovel comm skip with me round about the linden tree we'll skip in circles till we drop that go to the kills for a drink of pop. Our way we do temptress siren wick I only drink water from Widdecombe, Dick. It's black and brackish on tastes quite foul. Damn you shoveler she turns into an owl and that's it back in September. Hope you've enjoyed this tranche of hooting yards and bye bye for now. Have a good few weeks. Bye bye
