Listeners should know why this is the greatest book ever written. And if you don't, you'll soon realize so well. We'll continue where we left off. I'm not going to devote the whole show to the book this time. But But well, I'm still intending to read the entire book on air over future weeks. Some we continue from further science book 20 with national bill hooks. One that North York bill hooks are the thickest and heaviest and double tiered round ended to south to north Midlands Wales. pointed end down smaller, deeper bladed in Wales. Longer bladed in East Anglia. Thorne topped three embarks the thin single blade curves down in a smaller hook and there is no Thorn second top layer etc. slug flow flowers one that smog flowers are rapid flowering, dying, plump seed pods dark purple black growing tops anti cold fragile grow in industrial suck air Auntie mice large and small varieties convolvulus climatic code on impatiens, verse autumn, viola, etc. To add and vast swag plants appear to be high carbon plums.

Frank Key  08:03
so anyway those are some extracts from further science book 20 by Norman Davis. Davis and we're gonna have some more of that later in the show but I thought I'd also read you bits of Mr. Keyes, shorter potted brief brief lives still available from all good book shops. And as you know this is a collection of of over 500 very short, potted bitty Bobs about various people. People such as Margarita Lottie Italian St. Knows Rita of Cascadia. 1391 to 1457. On the day after her baptism, the parents of the future St. rekor of Cascadia noticed a swarm of white bees flying around her as she slept in her crib. The bees buzzed in and out of her mouth without causing any harm or injury. This was taken to be a sign from God, that the infant's future life would be marked by industry, virtue and devotion. She is the patron saint of French pop singer, Moray matier. So Edwin Missourians, English architect 1869 to 1944. So right when McKeon was averse to long stemmed glasses, fish knives, cut flowers, silk lampshades, pile carpets, the seaside statistics, painted nails, the diagonal plating of furniture and religious enthusiasm. Lady Macbeth Shakespearean character 1606 the actress Ellen Terry described Lady Macbeth as a delicate little creature with hypersensitive nerves. Arthur matron Welsh writer 1863 to 1947. Making believed we are much mistaken if we think that there is in ultimate reality, any such thing as a cow Olivia Manning, English novelist 1908 to 1980 at a party, john Gielgud knelt at the feet of Olivia Manning and told her he wanted to pay homage to her literary genius. Her reply was the moan that she could not hear a word he was saying, because the party was far too noisy. She hated most other writers, and had a particular animus against Iris Murdoch, because said Manning, she looked as if she cut her own hair with a hacksaw,

Wilfried Mertens Belgian politician 1936 to 2013 Mertens pointed out that you can't say I'll try to think like a Belgian. You either have it or you don't. I haven't actually because my mother was Belgian so I can think like a Belgian. But if you're not Belgian, don't even try to think like one as Wilfred Mearns told you. More animators, Swiss Polish English, Irish artist and occultist 1865 to 1928. My view is the sister of philosopher Henri Bergson, was accused 18 months after her death of killing Miss netta for Norio by black magic. It was said miners Spirit had appeared in the form of a monster cat and attacked the unfortunate netta. However, the scratches on the corpse were more likely the result of running naked in the dark over Rough Country, which Miss for Norio had been doing immediately before her collapse. Harold Maxwell with froy, English entomologist and founder of Rentokil 1877 to 1925. max roll the froy choke to death I like gas insecticide of his own invention. His last words were the little buggers got the best of me this time.

Unknown Speaker  13:03
ancestral birds that Australian birds represent ancestral European species and insight into their psychological differences would reveal how species psychologies evolve a new science, psychological evolution. The attack hack, which equals the coot once could not fly. Poo carco equals the more hen was once larger. The Walker equals the corncrake once flightless nocturnal in forest, x predator, burrow Kiwi equal the Starling always was spotted. Solid boned primitive large eggs. Great smell, top bill nostrils, forest nocturnal, flightless, no tail. The spotted shag equals the cormorant Black Swan equals the white mute Swan once black and rough intruder aggressive platform nest brolgas equal cranes once danced, ground nesting, no nest trumpets to a equals that house Sparrow once honey eating musical mimic kookaburra equals the Kingfisher once larger pro snake slippery once laughing suberb tame p wit equals the magpie once high tree quiet Cry, pears, winter flock. apostle bird equals the bunting tree harps, small flocks, etc. and so on for bird of paradise, crows, bowerbird thrushes, butcher bird, Shrike, rock, pigeon, doves, frog mouth, night jar, cockatoo, parrot, mutton bird petrels, Ki parrot crossbills, and finches, lyrebird pheasant, kagerou, bitterns, Mali fowl, Partridge, scrub bird, warblers, castleberry, domestic hen, etc.

Frank Key  16:13
Groups, one that as blood group o can be used by all blood groups, it was clearly the ancestral blood group from which all the others evolved to, ie blood groups A and B polarized from blood group O, and then re hybridized to blood group A B, A further blood group o equivalent, although the attributes of a post polarization unification are never the same as those of the pre polarization original unity, etc. Cold hot metabolism won that a cold body metabolism appears to cause increased pass fat conglomerates, thicker skin and low blood pressure red bleeding to whereas with the onset of a hotter body metabolism, the red muscle deposit red blood flow increases the white fat pass reduces and this thin skin bursts easily. et cetera. Sheen fish one that green and red sheen fish are opposite to green sheen Fisher compressed long bodied horizontal barbs through the eye of extended upper jaw pro feathery plants and low lip shade lively free swimming tropical schools peaceful male more brilliant black spot red brown etc. Three red shame fish opposite goldfish deep bodied tropical territorial impairs anti feathery plants nor them to pieces pro dried food brown back non peaceful one vertical bar through the eye female larger egg plumps full sun blunt snout for blue sheen fish x mosquito female yellowy silver brown larger cold water long body long stripe America's transparent fins full sun shallow running water veracious five gold and brassy sheen fish male brighter skulls silvery half and half fat long, sick mother of pearl, Shane fish Malawi small cottony skin Cline's etc. Seven, goldfish become silvery, kept in the dark.

Frank Key  18:55
JOHN just asked me if it's true that goldfish become silver if kept in the dark. I don't really trust anyone who questions the word of Norman Davis. But any of you listeners out there listening? All I can suggest is he got a goldfish and keep it in the dark and see what happens. And I will guarantee if Norman Davis is correct, your goldfish water and silvery. And thank you also to pansy kragle drew for reading about ancestral birds. pansies with me today because she's actually in a first for resonance. I think. This is a show featuring live knitting. Knitting is actually occurring. To be a Can you hear that knitting is actually occurring while I speak. What are you knitting pansy?

Unknown Speaker  19:56
It's a blanket.

Frank Key  19:58
It's a blanket. So while we have more live anything on the show, I'll read you a few more lives from Mr. Keys, shorter potty brief, brief lives. You set the pub by Dino Italian spiritualist medium 1854 to 1918. you cite the palatino claimed that when she was a baby, she was dropped on her head, causing a hole to be made in her skull. This was the cranium opening through which a cool breeze would issue when she went into a trance. Her seances were often accompanied by violent muscular twitchings screaming and shouting, a newspaper report described as a coarse looking woman of the Latin type who went anyone doubted her genuine this shrieks and gets very excited.

Waverly person, American seismologist born 1925 in a spectacular example of nominative determinism, Waverley person is an expert seismologist often consulted by the media to comment on earthquakes and tsunamis. Henry pert English Archer died 1552 pert, a Nottingham shear gentlemen managed to shoot himself in the head with his own bow and arrow. In 1552, intending to aim the arrow directly up into the air, he drew the bow back to its full extent. The arrow became caught, so he lowered the bow and leaned over to take a peek at the problem, at which point, the arrow came free and penetrated his head. He died the following day. Kim Philby, English spy 1912 to 1988 the journalist Charles Weaver, the late father and daughter of Boris Johnson, was asked if he was surprised when he learned of Kim Philby treachery, not really said Weaver. I never really trusted him. He was the sort of fellow who smiled at breakfast, that sort of thing. Iggy Pop, American musician, real name James Osterberg born 1947. At the time of recording the classic album raw power with the Stooges in London in 1972. Iggy Pop drug of choice was not a heroin nor amphetamines, but Harvey's Bristol creme Sherry

Frank Key  27:01
I mean, got carrot, short, hairy ruff. Large fat heads. This is just genius stuff. Morty prickly mushroom, and I don't know, I'm Paul, we're plugged in. there's ever been a band called White ghost, oblong blob. But I think John's task over the summer break will be to track down a group called White ghost oblong blob. And we'll all be able to listen to that. After it's back, when we're all back in September,

Unknown Speaker  27:42
perhaps I'll just record something and say call it under that name.

Frank Key  27:48
Or if you're at home and you'd like to form a band, and you'd like to use one of Norman Davis's phrases. I'm sure he'd be only too happy. In the unlikely event that Norman Davis is listening, sir, I salute you. And please get in touch. And otherwise, that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. The end for this pre the end before the summer break. Back in September backing up back in September. Many thanks to panda could not pansy cradle drew for reading about some of the things in further science and knitting, live knitting and thank you as ever to john for his indefatigable engineering without which you wouldn't hear any of this. Have a good summer. Bye bye.
