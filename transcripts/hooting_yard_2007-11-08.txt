Good evening, my name is Frank key and this is the strangely compelling hooting yard on the air. I'd like to begin this week with a quotation from 1672 Andrew Marvell poet, and although it's not apparent, it's from a prose work called the rehearsal transposed, as transposed as opposed to transpose. And I suppose it's about the dangers of taking one to writing too seriously. Nothing now would serve him but he must be a madman in print and write a book of ecclesiastical policy. There he distributes all the territories of conscience into the princes province, and makes the hierarchy to be bad bishops of the air, and talks at such an extravagant rate in things of higher concernment that the reader will allow that in the whole discourse, he had not one lucid interval. This book he was so bent upon, that he sat up late at nights, and wanting sleep and drinking sometimes wine to animate his fancy. It's increased his distemper Beside that, too, he had the misfortune to have two friends, who being also out of their wits, and of the same boat something a karma frenzy, spurred him on perpetually with commendation. But when his book was once come out, and he saw himself an author, that some of the gallants of the town laid by the new tune and Tay Tay Terry, to quote some of his impertinent sees that his title page was posted and pasted up at every avenue next under the play for that afternoon at the kings or the group's house. The vain glory of this totally confounded him. He lost all the little remains of his understanding, and his cerebellum was so dried up, but there was more brains in a walnut and both their shells were like thin and brittle. So this gentleman in the dog days, straggling by Temple Bar in Massey cassock and sir single, and taking the opportunity at once to piss and admire the title page of his book, a tall servant of his one J. Oh, that was not so careful as he should be, or whether he did it of purpose. Let's another book of 400 leaves fall upon his head, which meeting with the former fracture in his cranium, and all the concurrent accidents already mentioned, has utterly done him.

More brains in a Walmart indeed, Blodgett had a certain militaristic cast at his character. So when he was given command of a pocket battleship, it was understandable that he got slightly carried away. He fretted and fast over his epaulettes and other trimmings of his uniform to the somewhat embarrassing degree. So much so that he neglected more critical aspects of his duty, such as keeping a proper log. That's it is that we do not have a reliable record of his one and only voyage. This was a time of gunboat diplomacy, and bludger its mission was to anchor his ship in a faraway Bay, train his guns on the coast, and to threaten to blow the township there to smithereens unless certain conditions were met. Very straightforward, or it would have been had the ship not had for its navigator, a man who had lost his wits. This fellow's name was troubleshooter, and it's a wonder that he still had the confidence of the Admiralty, for he had been bonkers for years. Instead of steering the ship towards the far away Bay traps, you're pored over his charts and barked instructions through a pneumatic funnel that led to the ship becoming encased in pack eyes. Thousands of nautical miles away from its proper destination. There was no township upon which to train the guns, leaving Blodgett at a loss what to do, other than to print his epaulettes and other trimmings with a little brush. Trump's jaw, meanwhile, was following his own demented star. He talked pacing up and down the poop deck shouting at the sky. icicles formed on the brim of his navigator's cap, but he seemed impervious to the cold. Not so the rest of the crew huddled below decks, wrapped in blankets and keeping their spirits up by playing board games and eating sausages. Blodgett kept to his cabin, using his log as a pad for doodling. He had lost radio contact with the Admiralty weeks ago. There was nothing for it, but to sit the winter out and wait for the ice to melt. At this point, I expect the majority of listeners will be avid for further details of the board games and the sausages, and I will not disappoint. However, before dealing with those crucial topics, perhaps it's wise to say a few more words about Trump. Sure. His insanity was not in doubt. But what's never been established is whether he deliberately stranded the ship in Antarctic waters, or whether within the vaporous merch of his mad brain, he honestly believed the ship was heading for that far away Bay. There may be a clue in the words he was shouting at the sky while pacing the poop deck. And by chance, we do have a record, albeit fragmentary of what they were, or some of them at least by chance and airship packed to the gills with the very latest magnetic cylinder recording technology past overhead one day, and some of Trumps all shouting was picked up by its monitors and etched onto a cylinder preserved forever. If you get a special coupon for entry to the sound recordings room of the museum at or near ACC on the vog, you can listen to this bewildering catalog Paul Dobson once planned a pamphlet on Blodgett voyage and transcribed part of Trump chose to raid, but he abandoned the essay in favor of his justly famous bilgewater elegies. But it's thanks to Dobson though, that we can still have a record of the shouting and gain an eerie insight into the crack brain navigator pacing the poop deck of that ice good pocket battleship. So many many years ago. Wheat bulgur wheat, begins the Dobson transcription, wheat and gravel and sand and grit, powder paste, paste in puddles, gravel and sand crimini pitch and tar and globules of black black black and blue cracking pod sculpturing. underfoot, Paul Deleuze and glue pitted black olives in a jar pitted and black like a black pit. Crack bulgur wheat and cracking sand, black pudding, vinegar down your throat, molten muck underfoot in vast paced puddles of goo.

It's difficult to know precisely what to make of this, except to conclude that Trump's rule was completely off his head and that charts and barked instructions to the crew notwithstanding, navigation was not uppermost in his mind. That being so we can get onto the more diverting business of the board games and the sausages as promised. The ship's cook was a follower of the dietary theories of cans big get, and that being the case there was little if any animal flesh in his sausages. One might when monitoring occasionally sink one's teeth into a fragment of pig or goat or Starling, but only a tiny fragment, often so tiny has to go unnoticed. The cook made his sausages from an EU get approved compaction of mashed up turnips and marshland, reeds and grasses, leavened with some sort of secret curd. They came in two sizes jumbo and cocktail. Although the latter were not served on cocktail sticks due to EU gap stern prohibition of sausage piercing holes. Even the very ones made by the average cocktail stick were anathema to the dietitian for reasons propounded in the preface to his magisterial Codex saucy Adriana. Even if you're not particularly interested in sausages, this book is a fantastic read, and I cannot recommend it too enthusiastically. I tried to read a few paragraphs every day, much as some people would dip daily into the Bible or into prudence foxgloves winsome thoughts for the dull witted. Much of the ship's cargo hold was occupied by the cooked crates of sausage ingredients and he was forever puffing and blustering about his galley needing the turnip and marshland reeds and grasses and secret curd and occasional bits of pig and goat and styling into the sausage in which he took such pride inspecting every single one with a powerful microscope to ensure that it was free of even the most miniscule hole. And of course, the crew gobbled them down greedily at mealtimes, both the jumbo and the cocktail varieties, for they had nothing else to eat. And I think that's quite enough about sausages. Blodgett had made it a condition of his command of the pocket battleship that it be stocked with lots and lots of board games. And so three entire cupboards below the orlok deck was stacked with them from family favorites such as Pluto kratt, dentists potting shed, and to the Finland station to more obscure games like treat the dropsy with leeches, butcher shop railings and fictional athletes Bob net to vault cement running track Challenge Cup Heat for on the rare occasions he popped his head into the cabin where the crew huddled together for warmth throughout that freezing polar winter. Blodgett was always pleased to see that they were kept fully occupied by one board game or another. The gang of sailcloth Packers took particular pleasure in patch that sale a fast and furious yet at times slow moving game, involving equal measures of coming and luck. The board itself represented a piece of sail cloth, and indeed was made of sail cloth, and the players took it in turns by throwing dice and moving their counters to patch up the various rips and rent in the cloth with needle and thread. Meanwhile, over in one corner of the cabin, Broderick was shorter find the crow's nest men playing a sprightly game of groaning widow, a contest so fiendishly complicated that only the superior brain pans of the crow's nest men have a chance of understanding it. Other less bright sailors would watch gulping for hours as counters flew around the board spinners with spam card packs consulted and little plasticine models of characters from the Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann were put in place knocked over, taken to pieces remodeled, repainted, and had the heads pulled off them and substituted with special bonus tokens. Only a fresh pan of sausages from the galley would interrupt the crow's nest men's concentration when they would sulkily take a break to feed having taken snapshots of the board from several different angles to prevent cheating. And so the winter wore on until one day the ice melted away and the pocket battleship sailed home.

By this time, Trump shore had abandoned ship stomping off across the ice flows in curiously subdued fashion, no longer shouting at the sky, his face barely visible behind the thick row of icicles dangling from the brim of his navigator's cap, stooping occasionally to pluck some kind of primitive edible life form from the cold cold sea with his Ferber mittened fist. Blodgett watch from the prow of the battleship, as his navigator vanished into the white nothingness. weeks later, they began the return voyage guided by the stars, which one of the crow's nest men knew how to read. Blodgett was of course hauled before an Admiralty star chamber to account for himself. Why had he failed to sail to the faraway bay for a spot of gung ho gunboat diplomacy. He burbles and babbles and print his epaulettes and other trimmings, but at no point did he ever mentioned trouble. He had even expunged the navigators name from the list of crew pinned up on a post at the entrance to the star chamber. And inevitably, there was no reference to Trump's or in Blodgett, hopelessly inadequate Captain's log, which, I suppose begs the question. Did Trump ever actually exist? Or was he a Wraith or Phantom, or even a goon of the kind known to horn ships of the line as like ply the oceans sailing round and round and round and round into the Maelstrom?

Evening of lugubrious music and lopsided prose, the goobers music by David out of Spaceman, and the lopsided prose by me reading various items from the hooting out archive. And the idea is that David, and I will take it in turns. I'll read some pros and he'll sing a lugubrious song perhaps a company by the Bandra not to be missed. I don't think it's either free or extremely cheap. It's the West Wing theater in in slouch you can if you go to http colon, double slash fener fa double n e r.dd ict.co.uk. Go there and you'll find details of the manifest which is partly the evening as part of and you can find a little map which will tell you how to get there. So don't miss it. I think it will be absolutely marvelous.

You can't say listen to me again and and with a musical accompaniment. Anyway, moving on. pansy cradle Jew has reported to me that a pigeon or possibly accumulate, has become a regular visitor to her 16th floor window sill. And the curious thing about this pigeon she knows it's the same pigeon because it spends all its time on these visits standing on one leg. And pansy asked me She wondered if this is normal pigeon behavior. No doubt she asked me because of my breathtaking ornithological knowledge. And yeah, whether this was normal pigeon behavior, or possibly could have visitor be some sort of avian Ian Anderson, the legendary fish farmer and, and flute playing Maestro of Jethro Tull, who was of course, noted, possibly still is for playing his flute while perched on one leg. Anyway, I suggested that the best way to test this theory was to whittle a twig into a rudimentary bird flute, laundry it in the pigeon or cumulates beak, and wait to hear what mellifluous sounds may emerge, perhaps a medley of Dr. Bogan broom and living in the past and thick as a brick. Anyway, I'll keep listeners apprised of the results of this important experiment.

Every now and then, of course, here on hooting on the air we do a repeat. I don't mean or an entire repeat show or we do those but I sometimes reread pieces. And think of it like listening to one of your favorite tunes. This is called sappan soft days. Club stocks junk band crumpled Bay's tab boosh, the latest best selling paperback by pebble head. It's a wonderful evocation of those lamented SAP and soft days. tipping tapping Flim Flam. Goose greasing lavender and a 10 of Polish for the porch. The light in the tunnels and the flap of the flaps in the flat bury out by the buyer. Those endless bowls of piping hot porridge. Such were the joys of the sappan sopp days, he writes. And if like me, you're an unreconstructed sappan sophist, it all comes flooding back. There was an earlier Book Of course by in spip, and I stand by my review when it first came out in hardback, where I wrote, this book is shoddy and inadequate and inadequate. It is thoroughly inadequate. In spip had the temerity to write what he called a thorough and adequate account of those sappan SOP days, despite being a secret sopan savviest when I revealed this gruesome truth in spit was discredited and his bones were thrown off a cliff into the churning ocean. Good riddance to him. I say. pebble head, by contrast, has the measure of those sappan soft days, it seems he's listened to contemporary tape recordings of community. And I signed it. But I pointed out to him that I wasn't currently a member of the ping pong community myself, it was merely a disinterested intervention. Yeah, and that's it from booting up for this week. Next week. With a bit of luck, I'll be able to tell you Boris Johnson's reply. I think he should be corrected and publicly making pronouncements about ping pong that are not true. Bye bye.
