Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. It's a very long time since I last mentioned blasphemers Ted kargh pan. listeners will with long memories will recall that his dog won the Ayn Rand household pet of the week award. Back in 2004. Shockingly, just two days after the prize giving the hound was abducted by paid fiends. Even more shockingly blasphemous. Ted carc, Pan announced that he didn't care to pins Nora jot for the dog, and in any case, he was bent on obtaining a goat. Before examining in detail, the thrilling story of how blasphemous Ted got himself a goat, I should explain why he is never referred to as plain old Ted kargh Pang. Both his father and his paternal grandfather and several of his nephews were called Ted kargh pan, though not one of them was blasphemous. But Ted on the cold blustery morning of his eighth birthday, climbed the hillside bleak. And when he reached the top, he bellowed out a volley of curses and implications, dozens upon dozens of Gods shouting at the sky. Half an hour later, he was sat in the back room of his parents cottage, unwrapping his birthday gift, a picture of piety, but the wind had carried his words far and wide, and it soon became known what he had done, and thereafter, he was always known as blasphemous Ted kargh pan. Now about this goat contumely was heaped upon Ted's head after he expressed a callous disregard for his abducted prize winning dog. That's one reason he began to wear his grotesque sponge hood. But it was nonetheless true that his sights were already trained upon a goat. He had grown tired of his pooch, and even when it was returned to him after a daring nighttime rescue operation carried out by the Ayn Rand household pet Rescue Squadron, he refused to go back on his word. It was around this time, that is around the time of the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War, that Carl pan placed an advertisement in the Pang Hill bugle will swap dog for goat it read toggenburg preferred seven words only but seven words that had global repercussions. Busy anagram artists in the Pentagon convinced that it was a coded message worked tirelessly to crack it. George George rotator slop been dwarf roof whoo group hood was one of their earlier and baffling efforts. with hindsight, it's easy to laugh at the paranoia of the military mistaking an innocent dog goat exchange for something of more sinister intent, blasphemous Ted karg pan was not laughing. However, when traced is the author of the advertisement. He was bundled into a dream one morning and ferried to a compound deep below the earth surface, where he was interrogated by interrogators for days on end. Weirdly, each of the interrogators shared their name with a Hollywood star. So kargh Pam found himself questioned by Lionel Barrymore, Claude Rains, Vilma bankey, Tyrone Power, Edna purviance, Dorothy l'amour, and Burgess Meredith seven interrogators, one for each word of the faithful text. It was Dorothy lemoore allocated the word toggenburg, who discovered on day 12 that blasphemers Ted Carr pan was not Vietnamese, nor had any connection with the Viet Cong. judging him useless, they decided to release him, but not before Tyrone Power suggested programming karg pan's brain to turn him into a Manchurian Candidate style assassin. The contents of Ted scowl, however, proved to be so uncanny that the idea was dropped. And in the middle of the night, he was taken further down into the subterranean complex to an underground Cove pushed into a rowing boat and towed out to sea.

adrift for weeks blasphemous Ted carbine had ample opportunity to study natural phenomena. Both common and uncommon. He watched with his one good eye, the ephemeral beauty of clouds, cumulus, cumulonimbus, Stratus, stratocumulus, altocumulus, cirrostratus, altos, Stratus, nimbostratus, Cirrus and cirrocumulus to us Luke Howard's terms, though of course, Ted was ignorant of the Quaker cloud classifier. He looked at the surface of the sea. One night he was surprised by a shower of toads, and he noted that the light of the following dawn was bleached and eerie. Girls, orcs, skewers, guillemots, turns and other birds of the sea sword and swooped within his purview to put it pompously for view would do. In ancient times, it was foretold that blasphemous Ted calapan would be rescued by a schooner, but the prophecy will wrong. For after eight weeks alone in the ocean, he was picked up by a floating haberdasher. The haberdasher took him home to his seaside village, and as he walks unsteadily up his garden path, his prize winning pooch came to greet him. Yeah, happily. Car pants off. It looked suspiciously well fed. Then he noticed standing in the open doorway of his charming bungalow, holding a fork and a tin of dog food. Old Man pox haven from the Institute of plastics, who was his bitter enemy. What in heaven's name are you doing in my house shouted card pan, feeding your prize winning dog. As a matter of fact, said old man pox Haven, a look of insouciance on his pallid face. I have been at sea said card pan and I would like a cup of t. Feeding your prize winning dog as a matter of fact, said old man car, old man pox haven again. I said I would like a mug of piping hot tea yellow card pan growing in raged. Feeding your prize winning dog, as a matter of fact, said oh man pox haven yet again. Only then did Ted Carr pan come to understand that the enemy in his doorway was a phantom. Later that day, after he had boiled the kettle and made a mug of piping hot tea using the one remaining teabag in his pantry and put his feet up and ground his teeth. blasphemous Ted went to the library and consulted the newspapers that had appeared while he was out at sea and discovered that old man pox haven had died a fortnight ago. Sea jet Institute of plastics ends in mayhem said the headline of the daily cushion. While the doppelganger Gazette reported the same story under the heading old man pox havens slain by mutant moth beings. Cycling home via the track that bisected the dingey Marina, car pan one that if his dog was also a ghost, it had plainly eaten its fill in his absence, but could a real pooch be fed by a phantom? Being a blast femur, he knew little of the spirit world, he braked sharply when he caught sight of the dingey Depo dismounted and headed for the heart of the marina Chaplin. Father Tabak glib natto was an elderly crumpled priest who administered to the marina for over half a century. He was also a poet of some renown, whose finest work was probably daft Ned the welke the crocus a completely Anna grammatik rewriting of fellow Jesuit Gerard Manley Hopkins, the wreck of the Deutschland sheltering in his heart from a fine drizzle father tab, I believe natto was surprised to see blasphemous Ted cod pan lumbering towards him. He clutched a crucifix in his gnarled fist, and shrank back in the shadows. Cargo pan hammered at the door of the heart. Are you in their priest, he shouted. I need your spiritual advice. There is a ghost in my house that has been feeding my dog is such a thing possible. The good Reverend held tight to his cross and prayed desperately hoping that his blasphemous visitor would turn and leave. for him. The existence of ghosts was a heresy, and he knew nothing of dogs being a budgerigar, sort of priest, and indeed his prayers were answered, for after bashing the door a few more times. Ted calpains slunk away, he realized that they had not made one vital check. Was his hand indeed still alive? or haven't joined the old man pock saving in the shadow world beyond death.

As we wait for car pan to cycle all the way home To check his dog's brute corporal reality or otherwise, we might do well to consider whether his instinct was still to replace his canine power with a goat. Was he having second thoughts? After all, if his feelings remained unchanged after his abduction by Pentagon agents, and the weeks alone on a rowing boat in the vast and unforgiving ocean, why had he not simply put the dog in a basket and taken it to some sort of beast extrange office? For surely such places existed? Even in the small seaside resort, where blasphemers Ted's spent his bungalow years? One might put his initial newspaper advertisement down to a desire to avoid the beast exchange, perhaps, but assume that he returned home with renewed determination to get a goat for his dog. Why then, was he scurrying about the place like a scatterbrain? If not, that he was toying with the idea of retaining the dog, and consigning the goat idea to what a certain type of writer likes to call the dustbin of history? These are the sorts of questions you might be asking yourselves. I'm not for I'm not asking any questions at all. I'm beyond questions. My part in this is merely to tell you what happened. And what happened was this blasphemous Ted Carr pan arrived home, pushing past the apparition in the doorway and thundered about the bungalow looking for the dog, which was asleep on a blanket on top of a tall boy, and he poked at it with a pointed wooden stick until he was satisfied that it was solid and real and alive. And he was not taken aback that it did not yap more Yelp, fers postings were very gentle, and it had always been a heavy sleeper. Indeed, its capacity to remain unconscious in the teeth of provocation have been one of the things that had commanded it to the judging panel of the Ayn Rand household pet of the week contest. That and many other things. It's equitable temper, its is its tricks with a balloon being among the other qualities which won the prize, and then blasphemous Ted cod pan, lifted it up blanket and all and hoisted it over his shoulder still sound asleep and took it outside and stood at his garden gate, where they were joined by the Phantom of old man pox haven. And then he vowed that he would stand there come whether what may until someone came past trembling, a goat in a wheelbarrow, and he would lower the blanket with the dog in it into the Barrow and lift out the goat, whether it were a toggenburg or not, and wave the wheelbarrow person on their way and lead the goat into his garden, and at last, his desire would be met. And that is precisely what happened within 10 minutes of his taking his stand at the gate, for he was a lucky as well as a blasphemous man was Ted cod pan. Lucky on this drizzling day at any rate, and I know this because I am the ghost of old man pox Haven and I watch over Ted and his goat and the bungalow and will do so for ever more for I am a guardian ghost of a kind that Father Tabak libnah. hatto wishes did not exist, although he has a guardian ghost himself every bit as conscientious as I am, and every bit is determined to ensure that from now on, nothing will ever change in this seaside town that from now on, it will always be Thursday, and it will always be drizzling. And the man with the wheelbarrow will walk round and round in circles, first with a goat, and then with a dog, and the goat will be a toggenburg and the dog will be fast asleep.

Before we go on, I just like to remind you, of course, that currently there's a save resonance FM campaign. We need lots of money. So here's how you can, here's an idea for how it will be worth your while to donate money to resonance. Step one is to go to the resonance website where you will find a button to press which will help you donate. And then, if you put if you donate a Mac, a minimum of five pounds, I promise to include on the show of the 14th of February or around that date, a sentence of your choice in a story or your name, or any name that you'd like included in the story. So, go to the website, donate the money, and then send me an email to hooting dot yard at Google mail.com where you can find the address on the heating yard website at www dot hooting yard.org and tell me that you've donated money to resonance and give me this the sentence or string of words or name or whatever you like to be included in a special story to be read on the radio on the 14th of February. Yeah, I think that's what we need to know. Good. So I donate a minimum of five pounds. But for that you get a sentence. And the last story had we in fact was narrated by a phantom and this also has phantoms in it, which just goes to show how inventive I can be when it comes to subject matter. It was dusk, and wantons had gathered in the spinny. Beyond the spinny. across the lake was the running track where fictional athletes Bob net tavole has sprinted his way to immortality. The track side where once lupins had flamed fourth was now overgrown with travel or combined weed and blackish darnel clumps of which were thickest by the old Well, were a long long ago, the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman had cast her spells. When they marked out the athletic track back in 1934. They had forgotten about the well. They had forgotten about the Hornets too, and the wasps and the bees, all of them drawn to the field for as long as anybody could remember, and never successfully exterminated. Even the sulfur bombs detonated by old halabi squad of flying insect killers failed. Back then of course, old Hallo was not yet old, but he had already cultivated a certain gravitas punk teleo came to him later. Now the ghost of old helaba and fictional sprint champion botnet to volt haunts that long abandoned athletics venue. That is why at dusk over in the spinny the wantons gather, dressed in flowing gowns stitched together from fire damaged curtain material, the wanton descend upon the Spinney, armed with baskets of peppers and pea pods and potatoes, brimming baskets from which the peppers and pea pods and potatoes tumble and are strewn as the wanton skip along the path that leads to the spinny no wanton Stoops to pick up the fall and vege as dusk falls for they like to lay a trail. They make no secret of their gathering in the spinny across the lake from the ruined running track. All the town's folk know they are heading there at dusk on the third Thursday of each month, the skipping wantons with their baskets, but they are never followed. In the town shutters are shocked and lamps are lit and in their gloomy rooms that people switch on their radios loud and listen to dance band music of the Golden Age and distract themselves with card games and Sharon's for they try not to think about the wantons in the spinny summoning up the ghosts of botnet tavole and old halb. By the running track itself as dusk grows deeper, the Hornets and bees and wasps no longer stir. They go wherever flying insect go at night, or they sleep if such creatures sleep in their nest hidden in the brambles and the bind weed. Often the field that one saw Bob need to have all run around and round in record time is engulfed in mist. Why do the ones gather in the spinny across the lake instead of here?

It is because they believe that phantoms are imbued with special powers if they are made across a body of water. The wantons want Bob lit to volyn old hollub or their spirits to materialize among the slumbering Hornets and wasps and bees have the derelict running track and then to pass over the still silent like and that's to come to them in the spinny these athletic ghosts empowered by water We'll be given offerings of peppers and pea pods and potatoes and then the wantons will send them into the town to do what the wantons want done, but nobody yet knows what the ones want for them no third Thursday have the ghosts come shimmering across the lake to them? No, but wanting to wait all night skipping while they wait in circles, their gowns flowing and at dawn they skip away from the spinny their baskets empty back into the town where radio still Blair, where the shutters are still shot into the dawn of another day, when no one will speak the names of old hollub or fictional athletes Bob Nick tavole. Not today nor ever more for of course, neither Wiley trainer nor his protege ever existed in the first place. And if they're ghosts do appear, it is only once a month, one misty night in the wild minds of the wantons who skip in the spinny.

One other reminder before we go on is that you can now buy a paperback book of the best of hooting yard, not the best but 52 stories. Go to go to the website, go to the hootin yard website. And there's a little picture of the cover and you can click on that. It's only available online, but do buy it because then I can eat food. Like the Arctic turn which is neither from the Arctic nor a turn, Dobson's famous bilgewater elegies are emphatically not allergies, about bilgewater. I'm sorry, I've begun that all wrong. The Arctic turn is from the Arctic and it is a turn, I was thinking of some other bird of misleading nomenclature, or perhaps not a bird, but an animal At any rate, which is not what its name indicates. I'll try to remember what it was I was thinking of. But the central point remains true that the bills Walker allergies are not allergies, and they're not about bilgewater except in passing. Dobson wrote these magnificent pieces in a wintry month or two while living in a far distant land whence he had gone to escape having to pay his gas bill. Keen students of Dobson's life know that gas in many forms seems to take on a quite bewildering importance. In one biography for example, there are three times as many index entries for gas as there are for pamphlets. Marsh gas in particular permeates much of Dobson's middle years, almost as if it were that that he was breathing instead of oxygen. Perhaps it was. The out of print pamphleteer had a deep and abiding reluctance to pay for gas and often considered living somewhere powered entirely by electricity, or by the wind or the sun, or indeed existing without being dependent upon any source of energy whatsoever. But as marigold Chu has noted, railers Dobson might he was drawn inexorably to the blue blue flames of burning gas, a man mesmerised? Oh, I was thinking about guinea pigs, of course, which are not from Guinea and are not pigs. Why I confuse them with birds, particularly Arctic turns is beyond me. That winter season, then determined to outwit those who provided him with gas Dobson decamped to that far distant country, mountainous and cold, remote yet populous, a land of which he knew nothing except the design of its flag. On arrival, he discovered that even this minimal knowledge was redundant, as there had been a revolution. The old flag had been ditched, and a new one pink black green flew from flagpoles wherever he looked between the seaport and the chalet where he was to live for two months. Dobson counted at least 700 flags. In the chalet Dobson close the traditional Booker's drapes and placed his canister of Calla gas in a cubby hole. Knowing are not fair he was forever not knowing. He considered his surroundings. It was a small chalet with no hidden chambers false walls or concreted over ancient wells. Dobson was perplexed at the absurd number of metal coat hangers in the master wardrobe. And the equally numerous drawing pins in the drawer are top of the cubbyhole. The cubby hole itself was just the right size for his canister. He was looking forward to burning the portable gases the evening drew in, but it was still morning. So he curbed his impatience by exploring the outcrop on which the chalet perched, knowing nothing of geology and caring less. This took Dobson about five minutes, or about the time it took him to nor one of his Brazil nuts to nothing. Later in life of course, Dobson rose a number of pamphlets on geological topics as an exercise. Curiously, he never wrote about Brazil nuts. Temporarily out of reach of his gas creditors, Dobson decided to spend his first afternoon in the chalet on the outcrop in that far, far away flag mad land writing, but he was by turns, listless and restless, and irritated that his new domain failed to inspire him. by four o'clock, having scratched me a dozen words in his note pirate pad, then torn out the page and set fire to it. He went for a walk. turning his back on the outcrop, he headed downhill towards the nearest village, through which his taxi had taken him that morning. He had paid it no attention, phase eyes had been shut as like often were in taxis. Dobson used such rides for reverie rather than observation.

marigold to once put her hand to a story about Dobson's walk that day. It was called the village that lacked basic sanitation, and she refused ever to allow it to be published. All we know for certain is that Dobson returned to the chalet that evening astride a massive ungainly horse of chestnut complex, called Tim. He seems to have been convinced that mice was scurrying uncontrollably about the chalet, and that they would be frightened away by the sight of a big horse. In truth, there were no mice. Dobson had fallen victim to delusional visions because of the high altitude. Nevertheless, the presence of Tim snorting and stamping his hooves become the pamphleteer and the next morning, he dragged a wooden table and chair outside the front of the chalet and sat down to compose the bilge water allergies. Here is a list of buckets of bilge water I have seen, he wrote the famous opening words of what was to be his own favorite among his countless pamphlets. He spent whole days in the crisp open air, scribbling away, occasionally filling Tim's nose bag with horse food. In the evenings, he sat in the chalet staring at the blue glow of burning Calla gas, his night to untroubled by nightmares. Every few days, a panting cadet from the insanity village will deliver a metal Tapping Machine message from marigold to keeping Dobson abreast of events at home. Dobson wrote the final words of the allergies on a bright day in October. On the same day, there was a counter revolution in that cold distant country that pink and black and green flags were torn down and stamped into the mark swiftly replaced by red and blue and yellow flags. That panting cadet delivered marigold Chu's latest message his Kappa skew and bloodstains on his sleeves. The look in his eyes told Dobson it was time to flee. He made the cadet promised to look after Tim the massive horse, packed up his things and headed off for the seaport on foot. The gas canister was empty, and his work was done.
