Good evening. Do we need to do a mic test or is it done? It's all right. Okay. This is resonance, FM resonance 104. point four f isn't the right number. Yes. resonance 104 point four. Mm. My name is Frank key. Is that the right name? Yes, it is. And the show is hooting yard on the air. And that's the correct name of the show. Unless you want to call it the authentic sound of geriatric slobbering which is perhaps a more accurate name for the show. And last week, and the previous week, I've been reading a long story called the horrible cave. And I've had a number of letters from listeners saying, for Christ's sake, Mr. Key, when is this story going to end? Well, it's going to end this week, it's going to end right now. I'm going to finish finished reading the horrible cave. Here is an exciting adventure story. And when we left it last week, the narrator had had a sudden realization after many adventures, he is to do with their horrible case. He is currently at a tailor's trying on a new boiled shirt. And we ended last week with this. I realized with Southern clarity, the world shaking import of the message the thousand cows had been sent to give to me. Not only must I return to the horrible cave, but I had to take Christopher Plummer with me and somehow stop him ever getting out again. I put on my boiled shirt. That was just two hours ago. Since when I feel as if I have lived 100 lifetimes. I can barely credit that I'm sitting now in the reading room of a paddle steamer, heading up river to my home, where all I hold dear awaits me. I will be frankly embarrassed to be given the hero's welcome. I know is my duty to fight my way past streamers and bunting to get to my garden gate. There will be music and balloons and as I said streamers and bunting. And tonight in the tavern. I will be pleaded with towel over and over again. The Tale of how I outwitted the fiendish intergalactic hellhound known as Christopher Plummer. Freshly fitted out in my new suit, I shop I slipped I skipped past the being and out of the tailor shop. Clearly if he was no longer adopting his secret agent disguise, he had an agenda different from his previous visit. The stricken power of the Taylor hinted what that was. I hid in a culvert and waited for Christopher Plummer to leave the shop. When he did so, I was not surprised to see the Taylor tripping in his white like an organ grinders monkey. I followed them at a distance past the swimming pool and the gas board offices until I stopped at the gate to the allotments. After that, it was simple. I knew that Christopher Plummer would drop his guard as he communed with hollyhocks that the energy he needed to exchange.

Frank Key  04:26
swirling thought patterns with the plants would leave him temporarily exhausted. As soon as I saw them clamber over the gate, I head back to the pie shop and finding it shot, hammered on the door like a maniac. Luckily, the fop had not yet left the premises. When he let me in in these world weary manner. I apprised him of the situation with a rapid fire blizzard of Babel. It had no effect. It was the most intense fury ating pie shop for I have ever come across. Judging that I had little time left. I pushed him aside, grabbed hold of the pie trolley broke the wheel looking mechanism with my bare hands stuffed into the pockets of my new trousers, a huge amount of pastry box ribbon and ran back outside, pushing the pie trolley ahead of me. out of the corner of my eye I saw the cows looming over by the market square. And I knew then that I was doing the right thing. At the allotments. It was Child's Play to overpower the innovated Christopher Plummer. I had him tied up with pastry box ribbon on the pie trolley in the blink of an eye. pausing only to force a draft of Wainwright's invigorating syrup down the Taylor's throat. I bore off with my captor towards the horrible cave. Yes, I went back I had to, I could do no other and there the gaping mouth of the horrible cave. I gave the PI Crowley a mighty shove, and Christopher Plummer was sent helplessly into the darkness. Before I left, I found my signboard and touched up the wording within in deverbal marker pen and I planted Hobie hawks all around and only then did I head off to catch the paddle steamer to take me home. later tonight after the celebrations I will sleep like a baby for I must be up and about at dawn tomorrow to investigate the terrible pond

Frank Key  07:28
I'm gonna hand over the pansy cradle jus now who's put down her knitting and he's going to read to us thousands of unusual unusual and arresting facts about birds thousands of unusual and arresting facts about birds. read to you by pansy cradle to take it away pansy.

Unknown Speaker  07:54
Thousands of unusual interesting facts about birds was one of the fattest pamphlets Dobson ever published. The title is something of a misnomer, for the remarkable thing about this work is that it contains Not a single fact about birds whatsoever. Indeed, apart from the occasional passing mention of starlings page 49 Shrike let's page 92 and the swan page 119 birds are signaled signally absent from the text. In spite of this, the pamphlet has been hailed by the upstart young Dobson Ted Kak as the most informative text on ornithology that I have ever read. calc is not always the most intellectually agile of critics though, so perhaps we should not take into seriously the way we might for our brows in deep concentration that even the mirror squid from a theoretical Colossus like say, Terry Eagleton. Dobson wrote the pamphlets there's a time when he was preoccupied with moles. He was fascinated by their burrowing habits, near blindness and twitching snouts. Although the snouts of molds twitch less than those of shrews, particularly elephant shrews. Dobson was enamored of what he considered the more Moly twitching of the snouts of moles. Why then, did he not say a pamphlet of unusual and arresting facts about moles, rather than birds? When it was moles that intrigued him during this period? It should be noted that his tract makes no mention of insert Latin tag for moles here, either. one clue may be found in the fact that at the time of the pamphlets writing, Dobson was engaged in a feud with a bellicose Undertaker from down pointy town way. No one can be quite sure anymore what caused the vendetta, not even Ted cat who admits to other bef lummix meant about the whole matter. But there was an exchange of letters among much else. And in one of these the outer print pamphleteer wrote as follows. Not only are you a singularly bellicose Undertaker, sir, but you keep the seats in your death carriage in a very greasy condition. My Dry Cleaners have the devil of a job returning my trousers to their usual impeccability after last I set upon those seats when attending the funeral rites of thruxton rotten shore beppo, the noted molan bird expert whose friendship I had come to treasure. It is true that I have not sought from you financial recompense for the cost of decreasing my trousers, but that is only because I have a more terrible revenge in mind. the authenticity of this letter has been questioned, chiefly because the last thing one tends to associate with Dobson is a pair of impeccable trousers. I'm not suggesting that he was forever covered in Greece, far from it. But a certain shabbiness, even Grubbiness was part of his general aura, even the aura detected by our psychic brethren and sistren, as attested by the redoubtable naadam booboo, who sometimes did readings of the pamphleteers, ethereal being Dobson himself was unaware of these, as the turbaned, mme was given to following him about skulking down alleyways were creeping after him as he recognized her picnicking spots in fields and Parkland. She would target him from behind with her fearsome gaze, and make visible his aura for long enough to allow her to scribble a few notes into her psychic Notepad. Often such notes contain the words grubby, grimy, disheveled, and splattered with Mark and remember that was his spiritual aura, not his solid Earthbound person.

Unknown Speaker  12:10
Anyway, whether it is genuine or not, it is the reference in the ledger to Thrax flatten sharp Bebo that concerns us here. Dobson or the counterfeiter, pretending to be Dobson correctly identifies the deceased beppo as a Muhlenberg expert, as indeed he was, and one whom the pamphleteer met often in the final days of his own, the moland bird experts life. They first encountered each other at a football match, Red Star Hoon versus Pang Hill academicals, where Dobson had gone to make a tape recording of turnstile clacking noises, and beppo was present as a turnstile clacking counter. It may seem to be unusual employment for a Muhlenberg expert, but Bebo was the kind of impoverished armature who was perpetually short of cash. And on this particular day, he was actually very close to starvation. It is thought that Dobson took pity on the skeletal clap counter, and tossed him a pastry from his bag, much as one might feed a zoo animal. The two men rapidly hit it off, and indeed, there was something juvenile and their camaraderie. They addressed each other by foolish code names broadsword and Danny Boy, using these sobriquet as as an excuse to practice their impersonations of Richard Burton and Michael Horton, in the film where Eagles dare Incidentally, the film's screenplay, and the novel on which it is based, were written by the alcoholic Scottish writer Alistair MacLean, who is buried just yards away from Richard Burton in a Swiss graveyard. Several of Maclean's novels include the phrase, the huddled, shapeless pneus of the dead, suggesting that this was an eat a fix, lodged in the writers gin soaked cranium, perhaps none vanquish Bo memory from his war service in the Royal Navy, where he was involved in action in the Atlantic Theater, on to Arctic convoys, and the scorching carrier tubes and operations against Tirpitz and other targets off the Norwegian coast in 1944. In the Mediterranean theater as part of the invasion of southern France, and then helping to seek blockade runners off Crete and bombard Milos in the Aegean Sea, and in 1945, in the Far East theater, escorting carrier groups and operations against Japanese targets in Burma, Malaya and Sumatra. McLean's late in life claims that he was captured by the Japanese and tortured has been dismissed by both his son and his biographer. drunken ravings. The huddled shamelessness of the dead, is also the title of an exceedingly rare and out of print tops and pamphlet, a piece of fluff about dead bees. Dobson and Bebo began to meet daily commandeering a corner table in the cow and pins tavern, where they talked for hours about both birds and moles. The expert knew his days were numbered, as he had already been diagnosed with the invariably fatal withered innards syndrome. And it may be that he wanted to pass on his knowledge before he died. intriguingly in his eight decades, Bebo had not once put pen to paper, and his match the store of information about birds and moles, he carried entirely in his head. And what I had, it was diversifier. Dennis spear pine once described it in conversation rather than a poem as that pose head, that great block of human head, dense and solid and muddled like a potato. He made this remark during one of his rare television appearances on the shad rack and the Bendigo chape chat show, on which he was a guest in the week after babos death. I'm sorry, I must pause here and just say I don't understand what happened to me shock. Was he taken off the television credits? I have no idea. But it was only shadrach and abednego. No, I'm absolutely fine. I'm just I'm just just paralyzed with curiosity. Anyway, sorry readers, or listeners I should say. And back to the reading.

Unknown Speaker  16:48
There were others lined up to extol the burden mold expert, including songstress Kathy Kirby, and boulder habitat adventures star Patrick macnee. But bear pine would not stop babbling. And in those days of live broadcasts and a more spontaneous approach, he was allowed to continue until the next program, a three hours silent, black and white documentary about swans was due to begin. It was of course on a different edition of the same chat show that bear pint became the first person to utter the word lubuntu on television. If either moles or birds were mentioned Dobson's pamphlets, thousands of unusual interesting facts about birds, we could draw the sensible conclusion that the pamphleteer had simply mixed up the fantastic amount of information pouring out of beppo over that Tavern table. But as we have seen, most are not mentioned in the text at all, and birds only in passing. Were in then lies the enigma of the seemingly gratuitous title. One possibility is that Dobson was using a code akin to the childish broadsword and Danny boy with which the pair of aging rascals addressed each other. If so, I do not think it is a code anyone is going to crack. Dobson left a teeming pile of notebooks, and scribblings catalogued by Allah wishes nesting burden others with heroic diligence, and it seems to me that somewhere in that paper, Kilimanjaro, they would have found a scrap upon which the pamphleteer worked out his cipher, if cipher it was the bumptious noodle head and pretend Dobson scholar Emmerich vivan, who made a fool of himself with his claim that the pamphlets title was an anagram of Ubuntu. and Deus can be no fruits of a horrid essay as salt gas, chiefly because it isn't. That did not stop him leaving a ludicrous fantasy that Dobson and Bebo were engaged in some kind of top secret paramilitary gas experimentation program. wittily one commentator dismissed Vin van boos ravings, as, like something out of an Alistair MacLean novel, demonstrating a contextual grasp of the whole Dobson beppo affair which I quite envy. I am doing my best to see but though I have studied the pamphlet for years now, I can still make head nor tail of what Dobson was driving at. Usually you know where you stand with his titles. How I poked a pointed stick into a hedge is a pamphlet in which Dobson writes about poking a pointed stick into a hedge. Christ stop to the bully is about Christ stopping at a bully. Granted in both his works as with almost all his pamphlets, Dobson veers off into often surprising digressions, but generally speaking he takes this subject is fad or whim of the moment. And rings out of it all that can be wrong and then some. Even the youthful callow Ted Kak has had the insight that whatever the topic of his pamphlet Dobson his ambition was to have the last word to make any further approach to the subject futile for at least a century and preferably longer. Whether writing about carpet beetles or electrical wiring systems, or a dubbed version of the soundtrack to Carl Sagan television series Cosmos Dobson worried away at his theme, like a small predatory beast nying upon the limp body of a smaller, non predatory beast, from which the life was rapidly draining, as if it were a Tawny owl with a hamster or shrew with a newborn goat, for example.

Unknown Speaker  21:06
So if we take Ted cacs metaphor and think of Dobson as a Tawny owl or shrew, what kind of hamster or newborn goat is he tearing to pieces in thousands of unusual and arresting facts about birds? Is that a question to which we can ever give a sensible answer? Well, I think we can. Not today maybe, and perhaps not tomorrow, nor even this week, nor next week, nor next month, nay even unto St. Louis stay, but I will promise you this much. By the time you are all celebrating the next st. lupis day, I will publish the mighty tome on which I have labored like an idiot for the last God knows how many years. I long ago lost count of the number of tallow candles I have burned to light to my futuristic flame resistant reinforced plastic writer's cabin, where I crouch, scribbling away through days and nights year after year, sustained only by a peculiar soup based nutrient slop, and by a blinding conviction that my privations are worthwhile, because I shall finally pierce the shroud of ignorance enveloping Dobson's fattest pamphlet and when on that merry day, the annotated pop up addition of thousands of unusual interesting facts about birds by Dobson with a preface, introduction, notes commentary afterwards, extra Jesus maps color plates, exquisite binding, greaseproof wrapper and presentation crate guaranteed free of infestation by microscopic paper devouring beings hits the shelves of your local supermarket. I shall smash my way out of my cabin, and scamper through the meadows, flailing my arms and beaming with glee.

Frank Key  23:30
Many thanks to pansy cradle jus for reading that piece and more about Dobson now, because for many years, Dobson worked intermittently.

Frank Key  23:45
Excuse me, excuse me. For many years. Dobson worked intermittently. That's a taxonomy of crashed things and squashed things. He kept two notebooks one with a blue cover on which squashed was written in big black bold capitals, and one with a yellow cover, onto which he stuck. A dymo tape strip punched out with the word crashed. Asked once by the spectacle devoted if there was any significance in the blue and yellow coloring of the notebook covers, Dobson's reply was drowned out by the screeching of a flock of minutes. On Earth, logically alert listeners will say, Boy, hang on Linux don't screech. And they would, of course be correct. But the minutes in question were rest screeching within it, a flock of rich Dobson had corralled and an annex to the room in which he granted an interview to the bespectacled devotee in Winnipeg or a suburb They're old. If he's important to be precise about these things have the rare screeching limits not screeched the bespectacled devotee would nevertheless have been disappointed by Dobson's reply. For the color coding of is crushed and squashed taxonomy notebook was the sort of thing the pamphleteer preferred to keep under his hat. I can reveal however, that when he bought the notebooks Dobson was under the spell of the color symbolism fisi theory theories of faffing often earned by Herne Hill, and Hoon with a place's faffing and trod through which, though, though, which one was the side of his breakthrough? discovery is not known. But then neither Holmes nor Hoon, does he have any commemorative plaque? Probably because his theories have been utterly discredited. If faffing turn is remembered at all, aside from Dobson's short lived championing of his of him, if he's a deluded monomaniac. He insisted on publishing his magnum opus in a stodgy German translation, thinking that this would give it more heft with Beatle brown intellectuals having no German Dobson had the ludicrously dense and lengthy text English for him by a distressed polyglot he met on a sand bank. The polyglot was grubbing for worms, while Dobson had got lost on his way to the post office. Dobson had something of a knack for finding himself on sand banks in tar pits, or stranded in drainage ditches without ever knowing quite how he got there. marigold coo suggested that he get himself a pair of shoes with a compass concealed in the heel, such as well, once worn by venturesome tinies but the pamphleteer was far too fond of the of his padded Bulgarian Security Police hiking boots to contemplate and claimed your footwear. In any case, it was one of Dobson's physical peculiarities, that he emitted violent magnetic discharges. So but campuses in his vicinity went wildly spinning, by all accounts sappington to was subject to anomalous magnetic phenomena. Although it may be a myth that the popular cartoon character magnet boy, the boy magnet was based on him.

Frank Key  27:55
During the period of his infatuation with the muddle headed color, symbolist Dobson considered writing a potted biography of Farmington, but found facts hard to come by, after a fortnight of tough and grizzled research, all he could say for certain was that Farrington had an extremely large head. Passes were known to balked at his approach, and more than one practicing phrenologist. I'd been driven to fit and vapors when attending to him that much gave Dobson about half a page of material, not nearly enough for a pamphlet, however, potted it might be he scrunched up the page on the wiki and jotted his notes and tossed it into a canal, an act of wanton littering, which earned him withering looks from the lock keeper for the next 20 years.

Frank Key  28:58
Oh, I'm, um, we're gonna end there. Partly because I want to clear my throat partly because I'm rather tired, which is why I'm very thankful. so grateful to pansy cradled you for reading half the show today, and I will be back next week with more. Probably more about crushed and squash things and reproached for canal lock keepers. Anyway, that's it for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. And at least we got to the end of the horrible cave long, vast and also you've had lots of interesting factual information about Alistair McLean. So Finn calm and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
