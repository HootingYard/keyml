You will need to keep your wits about you now to maneuver the fierce tongs with precision on the hop. Given that I've been talking for three and a half hours, but suddenly realize I've only just gone on air in the last few seconds, I assume you have no idea what I'm talking about. You're just gonna have to catch up as best you can. It's if the mitten on your left hand is smoldering, as it's probably the case, take it off, place it somewhere out of harm's way, and put on one of the spares from the pile. Try to do this without letting go of the fierce, fierce tongs in your other hand, and keep hopping. You should try to strike no more than a couple of yards from the skirting board. If the room has been built without a skirting board, as can happen in some barbaric buildings, someone wanting to being visually through the power of your imagination. An imaginary skirting board may not pass muster with certain jaundiced souls, that your soul is not yet jaundiced, is it? At least it shouldn't be not widely brandish the fierce, fierce, fierce tongs and hop.

I'm sorry about that. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And I was assured that today's show started at three o'clock in the afternoon. So I was talking away there for three and a half hours. But only only at half past six the usual time that I go on air. So I'm afraid that wouldn't have made much sense to you. Never mind. The King's Speech. That film The King's Speech has garnered a lot of attention. It's meant to be one of the most popular films seen. For many years, I haven't seen it myself. But what I have got is a transcript of the King's speech. Hello there, I am the king. See my crown? See my scepter see my baubles and my magnificence. I am like unto a god, am I not? When I snap my fingers at queries come sprinting. They formance scrape. I demand sausages and sausages effect. I demand the sun to be blotted out and the sun is blotted out. I do man the head of my enemy impaled upon an iron spike and my enemy is tracked to his lair and beheaded and his head is impaled upon an iron spike and it is brought to me by my EQ queries. If I should change my mind and wish to and behead my enemy and show him mercy to have him skip and frolic about the palace for my amusement, then his head is plucked from the spike and glued back onto his neck and his body is animated by fearsome bolts of electricity, and he jerks and skips and frolics as is my whim. Should I wish to engage him in conversation? acrylic quist is found in some remote village and brought to the palace to practice his skills. The conversation might go something like this king, that's me. When you have finished skipping and frolicking, would you like a bite of my sausage? Enemy through the ventriloquist Oh yes, please, Sire. King, then a bite of my sausage you shall have seats your car votings and true enemy. Thank you saya. Then one of my inquiries will work the drawers of my enemy by sleight of hand to bite off a portion of sausage. Further bolts of electricity will be applied if necessary, when the equity is standing well back unless the equity is dispensable. Some equities are some arms to help remember which is which I have them wear different colored caps. I designed the caps myself, for I take a great deal of interest in uniforms and insignia. When an equity wears incorrect dress, or is insufficiently spruce, I fly into a rage and order the laying waste of that part of my kingdom from whence the offending aquarii hails. Alas, there are fibbing queries, and on occasion, entirely innocent parts of my kingdom have been obliterated by fire and sword. This is how it might happen. King you are wearing the emblazoned ribbon of gak on your left arm instead of your right you scruffy in great, tell me from what part of my kingdom you Hail aquarii fibbing from smiggle be marshes saya. King, then smiggle we Marchioness shall be laid waste this very our query? Yes, Sire, I shall see to it at once.

Short of inventing a truth serum, it's not clear to me how such Miss obey alliterations can be avoided. Mind you, I've invented many other things. I invented the self polishing crown, the hovering kingly orb and the Regal smoker's pop tart toasting fork, not to mention a special cushion upon which to rest my swollen head. It is a speaking cushion. As soon as it comes into contact with my head, it tells me repeatedly in my own kingly voice, what a fantastic and magnificent King I am. The glorious words travel through my ears into my brain, just as these glorious words I'm speaking now, travel through your ears, or peasants into your brains. And equity wrote this speech for me. Which reminds me, I better check what color his cap is. I shall do so now. You may rise from where you sprawl in the market and go about your business, tilling the fields, Bringing in the sheaves be gone.

I plucked a bug from a sprig. It was a gorgeous spring, and its gorgeousness was unimpaired by my plucking. It bought buds beyond counting, and I would defy even the most eagle eyed of observers to pinpoint the spot on the sprig from which I plucked the Bad Boy Scout or girl guide set a challenge to ascertain if the sprig or hole or had suffered a tiny depredation would have failed, I'm sure assures eggs is eggs, but there were no scouts or guides here about nor even Woodcraft folk, for the area had been cordoned off by coppers following an enormity Oh, perhaps a police officers child actually chaperoned might have been allowed in. But it was unlikely for this was remote woodland far from town far from where tinies gather and cavort. the enormity involving slaughter and an axe and a great deal of blood and gore had was assumed been committed by the psychopath babinski, of whom there was no sign in the immediate vicinity. He was perhaps hiding in a cop's dogs were sniffing it was by dint of the dog that I had been allowed through the cordon. For I am a specialist in the interpretation of dog behavior. It has been said of me cruelly but with some measure of truth that I understand dogs better than I do humans. Sometimes I wake suddenly in the night, barking and howling, my hands are hairy. In plucking the bug from the sprig, I was not neglecting my duties, where he had entered the cops, the dog and die in search of babinski and it was the work of a mini moment to pluck the bug from the spring. I barely thought about it. The woodland was dense and it was in the densest of thickets one was most likely to find a serial killer concealed and as I applauded In the wake of the sniffing dogs, I had occasion now and then to raise my arms to push past sprigs and bows that would otherwise have impeded me. In one such maneuver, I plucked a bright bug from a gorgeous sprig absent mindedly I popped the bird into my pocket and forgot about it. of babinski we found no trace that day in that cops. When dusk approached, we called off the surge. The dogs were driven back to their pound by my assistant zalze Han and I went home to write my report. I work so much better at my kitchen table with a plate of toast and a tumbler of squelch show than I do at my office, desk, and then to the pound with all that dog din. In any case, my report was brief for the dogs that sniffed in vain. I added my signature with a flourish and my colored foam rolled the paper into a cylinder and shoved it into a canister and sent it whizzing off down the pneumatic tube which connects my kitchen with police headquarters elsewhere. elsewhere. I drained my tumbler of the last dregs of squelch Oh, and found myself at a loose end. If you were to conduct a straw poll of police dog behavioral experts at loose ends, I expect you will discover a huge variety of responses. Some might stare into space, some engaged in a hobby such as carpentry or beekeeping. Some might pour out another tumbler of squelch show and knock it back as if harrowed by thirst, some might go striding across the malls, chanting the trunk of the Moore's Strider to give but for examples. None of these appealed to me there and then so I rummaged in the pockets of my jacket which I had not yet taken off and hung upon its hallway hook. Last my fingertips fastened upon the bad I had plucked from the sprig in the cops. I'm no botanist, not even an amateur one. But I wondered if the bad would sprout were I to plant it in a pot of damp soil. No longer as a loose end, I cracked down within my quarters a pot and some soil the soil was dry so I added from a speaker to spot a water to in damp it and I place the pot of soil on a shelf. Then I press the button to it to reverse iceberg depth. That is one eighth of the band was submerged in the soil.

Frank Key  12:46
Well seven eighths remain visible. Now I would wait for it to grow. reasoning that it might be intimidated by the glint in my eye if I peered at it for hours upon end, I took off my jacket and hung it upon its hallway hook and went upstairs to bed, where I soon enough fell into a deep sleep trouble only by a couple of occasions in the depth of night when I woke suddenly barking and howling.

Frank Key  13:21
Also in the depth of night, unbeknown to me, they're stirred in the body I had planted in soil in a pot on my shelf, a worm, this worm and laying concealed in the body as thoroughly as bubinski had lain concealed in the cops. Yes, despite all the best efforts of my sniffer dogs, the psychopath had been there all along. Now, of course, undercover of the night. As I slept in my bed and the dogs slept in their pound, he fled to another hiding place, a cave or a spinny or a boarded up chalet at a seaside resort, just as the worm fled the bad, wriggling and creeping like an abomination mentioned in the Bible. But worm emerged from the bad and crept across the soil and over the rim of the pot and down the side and onto my shelf and across my shelf to each bracket and down the bracket and down the wall and over the wainscot, to the floor and across the floor to the foot of the staircase, and then up the stairs, one by one to the pine boards on my mezzanine and across the boards into my bedroom, and up the bedpost, and onto the counterpane and along the counterpane towards the pillow and onto the pillow, where on my head lay as I slept my untroubled sleep. The worm in the bud had become the worm upon the pillow, and it was a canker worm. The worm was crawling across the pillow towards one of my ears. Clearly intent upon entering my head and burrowing into my brain there interlayered cankerworm eggs, when I sat up with a start and barked and how the sudden disturbance discombobulated the worm sufficiently for it to change tack and move off towards the foot of the bed was set upon by a bed bug. By barking and howling done for the time being, I slumped back on my pillow and fell fast asleep, unaware of the tiny battle being fought near my tootsies, a fight to the death between cankerworm and bedbug, from which only one would emerge triumphant. But which one

we're having another of those little new musical difficulties when the music doesn't come in. And so don't worry about it. You will all be discussing the worm in the body in your hooting yard reading groups. So here are some useful notes and guidelines for discussion. terms used bad in plants a flower or leaf at any stage of growth until fully opened. sprig a shoot twig or spray of a plant shrub or tree worm. any animal that creeps or crawls babinski lumbering walrus mustache psychopaths psychopathic serial killer dog, a domesticated carnivorous mammal, Canis familiaris, or Canis lupus familiaris, which typically has a long snout and acute sense of smell, non retractile claws and a barking howling or whining voice widely kept as a pet of a hunting, herding, livestock guarding or other utilitarian purposes. Cops similar to a spinny copper slang term for plod. Terms not used in the piece. Detective Captain kargh Pan babinski his nemesis, nemesis, an agent of retribution. Agent when used in the term Special Agent did not rank similar to detective captain in certain police, copper or plod hierarchies. And here are some questions and guidelines for discussion. Why do you think the narrator enters a cops rather than say a spinny? Make a list of the kinds of plants likely to be found in a cops far from the nearest town. The narrator tells us His hands are hairy, are yours. Give a detailed character sketch and potted biography of zahlt, an embroiderer counterpane similar to the one across which the worm crawls? Do you think babinski is a evil or be sick? If and when he is eventually caught? Do you think he should be one confined to a prison to confined to a lunatic asylum three hacked to pieces by an angry mob or for allowed to escape scot free to resume his catalogue of enormities Why do you think the narrator drinks squelch show rather than a nice piping hot cup of tea? When he titled one of his angry Scottish novels, how late it was, how late Do you think angry Scotsman James Kelman was thinking about your own hooting yard reading group and its tendency to continue Wittering on and on and on until the cows come home.

I'm following the appearance those notes for groups on the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org as you recall, go and visit send me money and inexplicable circumstance was drawn to my attention. I got a letter from dimity cashew. Dear Mr. Key she wrote, you seem to think that all your devotees belong to hooting yard reading groups, groups which meet to discuss your work so long into the night until one among them remarks how late it is how late and the cows come home. Well, I for 1am, a member of no such group, though I am a loyal devoted He who has been reading your mighty prose since time immemorial or there abouts. I devour your outpourings daily reading the postage is on my computer, or via the special app on my I hoot. All by poring over your splendid paperback books available through your website. Sometimes I even listen to the podcasts from resonance FM, where I might be fortunate enough to hear some of you will stories in between all that coughing and spluttering. The point is that however I choose to ingest your blathering, I do so alone. And I never discuss the experience with another living soul. Not even with little severing my pet badger. Actually, I must confess that I did want to express an opinion on one of your pieces to little Severin but being a badger, He neither comprehends nor is able to imitate human speech. So that was something of a fool's errand on my part. It is true that he is a mystic badger. But his mysticism is confined to prognostications of the future, derived from squabbling about it undergrowth akin to the way a haruspex would read the hot and bloody and trails of a recently slaughtered poultry bird. Anyway, I can't begin to imagine what it would be like to sit round with a group a school of other hooting yard fans babbling about your prose off the top of our head. The thought had never even occurred to me, but now it has and I'm quite intrigued. Do you have any tips on how I might set about organizing such a group, including some guidance on what manner of refreshments I ought to make available? Please note that I'm currently residing on a remote and barren atoll plopped somewhere in the middle of a wild and wanton sea, with only a ragged tarpaulin for shelter, and little Severin, the mystic badger for company passionately yours dimity cashew. While I'm pleased to inform this cashew that I have made special arrangements for a jet aircraft to zoom over at all later this week, spelling out clear and comprehensive instructions for the setting up of a hooting yard reading group by means of ingeniously patterned vapor trails emblazoned across the blue, blue cloudless sky.

That's almost all we have time for this week. But to end the show, I'd like to read you something that I found on an excellent website called futility closet, which I recommend futility closet into Google and I'm sure it will take you straight there. Always many, many things of interest every day, usually twice or three times a day. Anyway, this appealed to me very much. Here are some useless phrases drawn from actual phrase books by the Swedish linguist Mikhail Park Val, from the book limits of language published in 2006. It doesn't give or the futility closet doesn't give the exact sources of the phrases. But these are all phrases drawn from genuine phrase books. What time were these branches eaten by the rhinoceros? I don't play the violin but I love cheese. have my own syringe. I had a suckling brother who died at the most tender age. The Beast had a human body, the feet of a buck and a horn on its head. Because I was out buying a pair of wooden shoes. I had yams and fish for two days, and then I ate Fern roots. I want a specimen of your urine. The corpse will be taken to Tonga. So I'm sure you will find all those phrases useful at some point in your travels. Wherever you go traveling, remember to tune into hooting yard on the air on resonance FM next week at the same time 630 I'm not sure what we're going to do about the three and a half hours time in withdrawing which I babbled earlier. Who knows maybe one day one day you might get to hear it. Okay, that's it for this week. Bye.
