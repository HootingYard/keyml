Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or w w w dot resonance fm.com My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. The cafe cantata, to which you are so earnestly trying to give meaning opens in shreds, which encircle the room in unison with the cigarette smoke. A philosophy which my dear friend uttered in more somber vein, and I, too, have a lesson, but one which yohann can never have meant, and which, cowering unsympathetically your arm shot up in phallic conspiracy. I know you will always forbid. That was a poem published exactly 40 years ago by the sundial press. not written by me, I hasten to add, but something I've always wanted to read on the radio, for reasons which I think should remain private. I'm not going to say any more about it. Other than that, I think you should download the show as a podcast. Listen to it over and over again. Memorize the poem. And whenever anyone asks you to attend a poetry gathering, recited. now onwards, that's enough of that. poking about in a clogged flue with a wire brush. The noted historian of athletic pursuits, Alonzo potentate was intrigued to find a reel of magnetic tape. caked as it was with the gunk of ages. He had it cleaned by professionals and boy with a professional operating from a cabin on a perilously steep incline. The body that ancient reels of magnetic tape cleaned up good and proper with small fieger and jets of steam are us took seven years to restore the tape to good and proper condition. by which time potentate had grown a dashing mustache, bitten his nails to the quick and sat in many stadia, watching many sporting events. The day came at last when he could collect his fine from the cabin on the incline, and he hurried home to listen to it. To his delight, through hiss and crackle. He heard the only interview ever has been conducted with fictional athlete bob bennett to Vol. And he made a transcript of that historic exchange. Sadly, we have no idea of the identity of the interviewer, but I'm going to read it out now. Interviewer I'm so pleased you have agreed to be interviewed for my radio program, magnetic tape recordings of athletes fictional and otherwise, Mr. tavole May I call you Bob nit? Bob net devall puff puff, puff. Interviewer you seem a bit out of breath. Bob Nick devall pant interviewer I expect your training sessions sprinting round and round this running track for hours upon end has winded you somewhat. Bob need to vole jack. At this point, the interview is interrupted by guttural shouting Alonzo potentate suggests this is the sound of fictional athletes Bob lit two Vols all too real coach and mentor old kalob demanding that the spindly sprinter si another 50 laps of the running track. The long stretch of hiss and crackle which follows indicates that he does so leaving the interviewer presumably waiting trackside looking on in or then it resumes. Interviewer So tell me Mr. tavole, or botnet. Would you say your fictional status has been a benefit to your career or a drawback? Bob needs to volt emits groaning sounds interspersed with retching interviewer I have heard it parlayed about that the tension between your whole effective existence and the undeniable flesh and blood presence of old hallowed is what has spurred you on to such a treatment unparalleled in the field of provincial amateur athletics. Would you agree? Bob next to volt Mike gasping and spluttering noises

again The interview is interrupted by the Qatar racked Bella wings of old halabi who this time, thrusts a pole vaulting pole into his charges hands and commands him to volt over a dizzying dizzyingly high bar over and over again. There is a further half hour of His once again the interview resumes interviewer you knocked down the you knocked the bar down a few times, they're failing to clear the jump. How did that make you feel? If indeed you are capable of feeling being a fictional athlete? bob bennett tavole pant pant pant. Interviewer Some say your coach old halabi over there in his trench coat and Homburg is quite a hard taskmaster, particularly given his background as a secret policeman in one of the more rigorous East European communist regimes. Is that true? Or does he treat you with kid gloves? botnet to vole, jack. Interviewer to the audience. And with that the fictional athlete goes herring off again, round and round and round The track and the gathering dusk. I did try to get a word in with his coach and mentor, but I'm afraid old halaal has staggered off to a distant kiosk to get a carton of cigarettes. Such of the ways of this legendary non fictional athletics coach. Alonzo potentate has taken his transcript to Hollywood, where he is in talks to turn it into a screenplay for a blockbuster movie. Word has it that Kevin Costner has expressed an interest. So that seems unlikely, as the kempster has a very limited range of expressions, and they are without exception, wooden

looked out of the window, and in the moonlight, I saw a man with a gray untidy beard standing next to the henhouse. For a moment I thought it was the Archbishop of Canterbury, but I blinked and rub my eyes and looked more attentively and saw that it was not stupid me. Why on earth would the head of the Anglican Church be standing next to my hen house in the middle of the night? But then why would anyone be standing there bearded, motionless hands in pockets silent. I put on a pair of stylish pair met three trousers and a boxy phungster jacket over my pajamas and crap down the stairs like creaked, but then would always creaks in the night for reasons to do with moisture and air and shrinkage, which I barely understand, before slipping my feet into a pair of tickety boo Winkle pickers. I paused in the darkened parlor, took the lid off the tank and sprinkled some food for Dan and goo goo and Penfold and Hobbs. They are my foursome of terrapins. They do not usually get fed at night, and I cannot explain why I fed them now. But I did I did. As the evidence shows, I think you'll find the relevant passage in bundles for unlatching the back door as quietly as I could, I felt in my jacket pocket for a weapon. The man with the beard could be benign, but equally he might mean me harm, and I wanted to be able to protect myself. As I hoped, there was a sap in my pocket. Ordinarily, I used it to some nothing bigger than a squirrel, but I knew that its previous owner, a copper had stunned many of malefactor caught red handed in the prosecution of a crime. My heart was beating unnaturally fast. So before swinging the door open, I turn back into the kitchenette and fill the beaker with water from the cold tap to wash down a couple of pills I took from a bottle in a drawer. They were dr Baxter's calmative preparation tablets. I swear by them passing the parlor door I saw out of the corner of my eye that I had neglected to replace the lid on the terrapins tank. Hardly I made goods that are mission but not before counting the terrapins to ensure all four were present and correct. They were Penfold looked a bit peaky. I resolved to observe him carefully over the next few days. I thought you see that I would have those days to fritter. Approaching the now unlacquered back door again, I pondered whether the wearing of a hat would be advisable. The bearded man by the henhouse was bare headed, I had noticed, but that did not mean I too, should go hatless. I turned to my rack of hat hooks and plucked more or less at random, a Chepstow tip for battered with age but perfectly molded to my rather peculiarly shaped head. I've always had trouble buying hat. Oddly, this one I had obtained secondhand from a used hat shop. Lord alone knew how old it was, or how many heads it had adorned before mine. I opened the back door and stepped out into the night, the moon had vanished behind a cloud, and it was darker than I expected. I peered towards the henhouse, and saw the silhouette of the man with the beard. So far as I could tell, he had not moved a muscle since I watched him from my window. I wondered if it would be a good idea to rush him across the lawn, fell him by a batch on their head with the SAP and ask questions later, that I recalled had been the coppers technique. But then it occurred to me that jellico my peasant helpmeet had been toiling in the grounds the previous evening, and he would likely have left a rake or a spade lying about obscured in the gloom, over which I might stumble and fall, thus giving the Beardy man an advantage. jellico is a tireless and diligent worker, but he has slapdash ways. On the other hand, he knows more about potatoes than any man alive, but that's by the by. Without taking a step forward, I decided to call out to my mysterious nighttime visitor. A boy there man with beard, I cried. Why stand you there loitering next to my henhouse in the night.

There was no reply, say for the rustling of a small nocturnal mammal somewhere in the head, and distantly the Hoot of an owl. After a few seconds, I repeated my inquiry slightly louder and changing the word order. Again, nothing. The man with the beard still only visible to me as a looming shape against the hen house wall remained utterly still and silent. I judged that he was an inch or two taller than me and bulkier, though the latter might be accounted for if he was wearing say, Be degroote overcoat or similar padded winter where I had a beat degroot to myself, and thought I ought to have donned it instead of the funk stir, but then I remembered it was at the dry cleaners jellico had spilled some sort of horticultural fluid on it when I loaned it to him, one freezing day, out of the goodness of my heart. still unsure who or what I was dealing with. I took the sap out of my pocket, ready to strike if need be. Its weight was reassuring. Then the moon emerged from behind the clouds as they scattered westward in the night, and I was able to see the bearded man more clearly. His beard was indeed untidy and gray, almost white, and he did in fact bear a distinct resemblance to the Archbishop of Canterbury, that he was on bespectacled spectacles would have been of no use to him, for I saw now in the light afforded by the moon that his eyes were milky white and sightless. He was a blind man with a beard. He had neither stick nor dog to guide him. acting on impulse, I shouted. If you have come to steal my hands, Sir, you are on an errand to nothing for the henhouse is empty. This was a bear face to lie. There were plenty of hens in the henhouse. But I could guarantee they were all away with whatever fairies home to the dreams of hens, for jellico had taken to lacing their feed with ground up Dr. Baxter's tablets. Still, there was no response from the bearded man picking my way carefully across the lawn. I walked towards him, the sap in my fist. Now at last, I provoked a reaction, the span around, turning his back to me, and then, unaccountably he began to run even to sprint off Crossing jellico is potato beds. How can a blind man go so fast? It was then I made a terrible, terrible mistake I set off in pursuit of him. I was surprised how easily my aging, creaky bones sped over the ground. I felt as if I were running on air. Usually when I run, for example, to catch a bus or to waylay a squirrel, I developed an instant stick, and I panned and Drew, not now, I even managed to keep my hat on my head instead of it flying off, as it tends to do when I build up speed, in spite of it fit. Before long, we were running the blind man and I through country I did not know. The vegetation grew Wilder and unfamiliar and oddly lascivious birds of the night flew past my head, enormous and shrieking. The air became somehow thick and damp and humorous. And on we ran the blind man always just ahead of me. I could not catch him. In this night that has lasted years, I'm beginning to realize that I never will. Yes, I'm impelled forward ever forward over strange new ground in the moonlight in pursuit of a blind and bearded man I know now was sent to summon me for a purpose I may yet discover if ever we reach the edge of the world. And in the meantime, there are the bundles, dozens of them on the table in the parlor, next to the terror pain tank in which every detail of my life is ripped, and ripped in Braille.

rhubarb is the fruit of barbarians, and we live in barbaric times. That is why you see so much rhubarb on people's plates these days. But as we know, rhubarb crumbles, so too will the barbarians crumble when we smite them smite to your rhubarb, before putting it upon your plate smited while it is still in its rhubarb bed, in a tent under ARCA lights where it grows, so I am told, smite the stalks before plucking them from their bed and carrying them in a sack back home to be boiled and boiled and boiled to mush. It is food for barbarians To be sure, eaten without utensils shoved still hot into the mouth with your bare hands gobbled down. You will burn your hands on the rhubarb mush, but you are a barbarian burns and abrasions and cuts and wounds. I mean marks of barbarity. But you too will be smitten as you smoke your stalks of rhubarb, like rhubarb, you will be pulverized to mush by fearsome foes even more barbaric than you. They are gathering now beyond the horizon, behind the hills, over which they will come sweeping shouting a great roar of yet bass or barbarism. And look, they are armed with stalks, hard stalks, they brandish in their hairy fists, stalks of raw rhubarb. They are so barbaric they do not even know how to boil with fruit and triumph.

Here is a quotation from Thomas Nash 1567 to 1601 writing of the poet Gabriel Harvey, in his pamphlet, strange news of the intercepting certain letters from 1593. There is a doctor and his fat that have kept a foul stinking stir in Paul's churchyard, I cry him mercy, I surrounded him, he is scarce or doctor till he has done his act. This dodgy pool this died dopper this professed poetical braggart has railed upon me without wit or art in certain for Penny worth of letters and things Three farthing worth of sonnets, nor do I mean to present him and shakily to the Queen's full taker for Coach horses? For to that draw more equally in one oratorical yoke of Vainglory there is not under heaven. Why thou errand butter whore, thou, Queen and scrap of scold. wilt thou never leave? afflicting a dead carcass? continually read the rhetoric lecture of RAM alley, a whisper, a whisper, rip, rip you clean stuff Wrangler.

I don't write them like that anymore. The man who ate his own head is the new paperback potboiler by pebble head, the latest in his series of novellas featuring being of the future David Blunkett. The fictional super personal not of course, if you'd like to the name, though, some people do get them mixed up. Much the same collusion of political factors political moments can read, agonizing satisfaction individual 97 K, in which type of blurb the seniors don't want math. The terrible dictatorship ruling the planet was the Brotherhood of assassins. And Boris Johnson, head of the Democratic league was plotting to overthrow the harmony to storm a kradic rule that had Germany that mysterious group that controls the entire solar system was now threatening to control the entire human race and render man extinct. The entire galaxy and chaos. Now bloodshed then infinity. In the man who ate his own head, the being of the future, sit down at some sort of futuristic dinner table, picks up his futuristic knife and futuristic fork and tucks into a futuristic meal piled on his futuristic plate. It is unclear what is so futuristic about the meal, as it consists of peas and gravy and drugged hair and cauliflower and cream crackers. Be that as it may, a robot valet appears at Blunkett side, and through some form of futuristic mind control persuades him to eat his own head. This he accomplishes, though not without difficulty, and pebble head is very sketchy about the precise sequence of events. I won't give away the ending. Suffice to say that the paper backlist unleashes some of his finest narrative pyrotechnics and were introduced at the last to the being of the futures futuristic guide dog Skippy with the clear indication that this thousand died zinc, tin, titanium, Bakelite and leather hound stuffed with Excelsior will feature in the sequel grew out next week. Even as I speak, pebble head is tapping away in his chalet of pros brow furrowed pipe clenched in his infected teeth.

I had some cake inside a box, I had the box behind the head. The head was clipped by a snag tooth peasant using a rusty pair of shears. He'd left the shares out overnight, leaning against the side of a bomb. In the middle of the night, there came an enormous cloudburst. It was a downpour, the like of which leads to floods and puddles. so busy was the peasant over the next few days sloshing around with his siphon on drainage bent. He forgot all about the shears, hence, there rustiness, there rustiness. You must go and clip the hedge commanded the Goblin perched on the peasants shoulder A few days after the downpour. The sun was blazing so hot the head was dry vapor rose from it and dispersed. This was the morning I had the cake in the box and the box behind the head. I did not have a goblin on my shoulder. here about it's only the peasant to have goblins. The peasant cramped about looking for his shares. He found them leaning against the side of the barn, Rusty, Rusty. These will never do for clipping he muttered and spat, but his Goblin goaded him on it whispered rustic law into his ear. The sun is boiling in the sky, clip your head while it is dry. If your shares are caked in rust fool you are but clip you must. After hiding the box behind the head, I took up a position high on a slope for him where I could keep the hedge in view using binoculars. I was camouflaged as a shrub, the more acute peasants know every inch of their land and will be suspicious of a sudden shrub. So I was wearing athlete's spikes in case I had to make a run for it. But I drew the attention only of small snuffling mammals, and one or two birds of the air. I watched the peasant clipping the hedge with his rusty shears all through the long afternoon. His Goblin was fast asleep on his shoulder, the sun was sinking. Inside the box sat my cake packed, packed with Sal Tanner's fruit shriveled by the same boiling sun, but on a different day, quite some time ago. The hedge who then had been less profuse, the shears not yet rusty, Rusty, but the Goblin had even then been assigned to its peasant and taken up its perch on his shoulder, such other country ways. It was dusk when the clipping was done, and the peasant stubbed his toe upon the box. I was watching through my binoculars, his Goblin was awake again. It commanded him to open the box. It has been sealed shot with rivets, protested the peasant. Taken rivets sultanas and fears. What a world I engineer from my counterfeit shrub, I will outwit the peasants Goblin and it will seize then I shall shrug off my shrub and hair down the slope in moonlight and go home and put another cake in another box and seal the box with rivets and hide it behind another hedge tomorrow, tomorrow through my vinegar years.
