Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. I'm kind of going away for a whole month too much forgotten how to do it. I never mind. I did remember. I'm back and let's get on with the show. I look a Puffin has collapsed on that flow. Wipe the steam from your goggles and you will see it too. We should airlifted to the Puffin hospital yonder in our trapa tight those corks out of your ears so you can hear me speak. Love is a mighty power. And I love puffins as I love given mops and orcs and bunk sees snap those icicles dangling from your nose and you will breathe easier. Here comes a blizzard. Oh Puffin don't die. Stamp your feet in your furry boots my companion to men and a collapsed coffin in a white wasteland. allegory of something or other. The chopper blades of frozen and we are stranded or marooned. Come squiffy plod with me towards the Puffin. That way, we may give it a sucker. love conquers all, if you will wipe those damned goggles.

Frank Key  02:08
Now, I'd like you to digest that piece, collapsed Puffin and then re digest it, if necessary, if necessary, reread digested. Now using a sharpened pencil on a sheet of foolscap paper, write a variation of the piece from the point of view of the companion squiffy. You should aim to address the following matters. One, why do you think the narrator keeps nagging squiffy regarding his goggles, ear corks, nasal icicles and furry boots? To which of the pair do you think is the pilot of the Trapper? Three, does the collapse Puffin actually exist? Or is it an hallucination born of cold exhaustion or even pay bloco. For Do you think that narrator's rather of puffins, guillemots, orcs and bunk sees is sincere and unreserved, or is it an affectation? Five Can you recall any Nursery Rhymes in which bunk seeds appear? When you finished turn over the piece of foolscap paper, and on the reverse write an even more compelling variation from the point of view of the collapsed Puffin

took a snifter took a snifter. Then he revved up his jalopy. His jalopy he raved. With his foot on the pedal he roomed away, he roomed away till he was out of sight. As soon as he was out of sight, he screeched to a halt and fell out of the jalopy and into a puddle classes where they found him sitting in a puzzle, his hat fallen, and crane flies hovering around his Now bear Head. They found him and they discussed exterminating the crane flies, but could not think of a method of doing so, without causing collateral harm thomaz tout and last talc had to be protected at all costs for snifters or no, he was privy to secret details of the dustbin of history. So they placed a cordon around the puddle and electrified cordon using electricity and cables and chicken wire. They stole the chicken wire provoking the wrath of a nearby poultry man. Now lost out on this particular poultry man had never seen eye to eye. They had biblical differences, also Talmudic ones yet physically, they could not have been more similar. They might have been identical twins. They were identical twins. They had been separated. Last out and the poultry man at the age of 10. When orphaned the one had been sent to a Schloss and the other apprenticed to a big, bellicose, brutish, British butcher, famed for his cocktail sausages. There were no sausages at the Schloss. It was a Spartan Schloss run on vegan lines by a vegan flosser of great untidiness. The boot now was on the other foot. There might be several sentences missing from the foregoing sentences which might make more sense of it. Even if you're paying it haphazard attention, distracted as you are by a mark passed of core banisters with placards spitting and shouting, sockless dreary spitting and shouting, marching, marching past the last talcum, his crane flies in there cordoned off puddle on a Wednesday afternoon, at the height of summer, far from the Schloss and farther still from last touts nest now populated by birds, a nest in a tree in a forest. When we are done here, which will drive to the forest in a Japanese car.

Frank Key  08:12
I'm having a bit of a technical problem here. You may have heard me say, No, no, no. And that's part of the technical problem, but hopefully it will be resolved very quickly. And until then, here's a bit more Caucasian Mala. Bye.

Frank Key  09:12
I'm back. Here we are. I really hate it when people start sentences. We're so sorry. I apologize. So anyway, one of the things that's happened while we've been away is that I've been receiving medical attention. I have dm which is the short term for diabetic macular edema. Which means that the blood as far as I'm aware, the blood vessels at the back of my eyes are completely screwed up. And the treatment for this well, But sir, I every week, I'll tell you what happened. Every Tuesday. I go to a clinic at the hospital every every other day. tight, I go to a clinic, the hospital. And I'll be doing that every fortnight for the rest of the year. Luckily, it doesn't interfere with the show. But the procedure passes off quite painlessly and efficiently. But one of the things I've learned is, I'm now armed with a stupendously effective conversational Gambit. So, let's imagine for one wild moment, that one of these days I actually get invited to a swish sophisticated cocktail party, where I can lean in Susilo Lee against the mantle piece. Now, pick your various other guests approaching meter, engage in conversation with what they found me imagine will be impressive anecdotes. Oh, let me tell you about the time I met john F. Kennedy would say my ex employer elkon Alan, where he not late and lamented, or one of my blog posts was picked up by the Huffington Post would say my sister, Rita burn towel. Or it might be someone telling me like climbed Everest or swam the channel or discovered the Fab Four, or released ringgo or any number of thrilling fact. And now imagine a moment of silence while I pause and play that pause for all it's worth. And then I say, well, that's very interesting. And then I declare in resounding tones, but every two weeks, I have needles injected directly into my eyeballs. I can assure you that the effect is electrifying. I've already cried out a few times. I've sadly not in the context of a swish sophisticated cocktail party. And I can report that jaws drop I boggle and questions are fired at me. I of course, retain an error in seussian calm. I'll tell you what, as medical procedures go. This one certainly beats water on the knee or mad cow disease. When it comes to mopping the floor with a rival anecdote tests. It's great. All you got to say is every two weeks, I have needles injected directly into my eyeballs. And it's true in my case.

Frank Key  13:12
So that was true and so is the next bit of the show. This is a quotation. The problem is not the sheep. The problem is irresponsible shepherds grass spike on the radio during August, a spokesman for the majestically named irresponsible shepherding task force in the Forest of Dean. Apparently that rustic Paradise is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who among sundry enormities allow their sheep to bleed in the middle of the night. Personally, I'm not surprised to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleeding. Sheba, Harvey neurasthenic creatures who spend their entire lives in the state of fretfulness and nervous tension. And as a result, they rarely sleep. This is probably one reason why, as has been observed by several country persons, a sheep ambition in life is to die. A brief addendum when I posted that little observation on hooting yd the website, where of course you will be visiting hooting yd.org and I got a comment from my old maka, Max to shonai. Who said that probably one of the things that the irresponsible shepherding Task Force needs to do is to embed among the shepherding community, various of its agents, who would be of course, a shepherd, spy. This is what happens with Max you just groan when he says something like that, but anyway, I thought I'd Share it with you.

Frank Key  15:28
Did I mention that I have eyeballs and say I completely ruin that? Did I mention that I have needles injected into my eyeballs? Yes, I did. Stop going on about it. Okay.

Frank Key  15:47
And the hamlet of Glebe, there is a blind brute, the really Dressler, a man with the mean of a squirrel, or perhaps have a distressed mole, and they coach him this brute with fronds for his fond of front, they coax him out of his cubby and drive him out of the hamlet and up into the hills, poking at him with their pitchforks and making awful guttural yelps to a fright him. And when he is up in the hills, they scamper back the villages, and hold a picnic upon the green, munching their sausages and plums and swinging their cans of sculpture, singing round delays and setting fire to Lady but they are a vicious lot, each and every one of them. And the blind really Dressler dares not return until off until nightfall. From up in the hills. He senses the twinkling stars by sniffing and by running his fat fingers through the air. And when he shores his night, he comes clumping down from the hills, pausing to slurp the water from rills and he enters the hamlet of Glebe in the darkness and crosses the green and he stumbles upon the picnic remnant discarded sausages and plums, the sausages of contaminated meat and the plums half rotten and sour, and he gobbles them down his squirrelly Moly gullet. And then by tuck, he gathers up the crumpled and empty squelched junk cans, and carries them to his Cubby, and falls into a dreamless snooze, from which he wakes in the morning, when he hears the clink and Clank of the milk card and the horrible hulu's of the villages. And he takes his hammer and beat flat the squirrel joke cans and adds the flattened tender his store of flattened tin, and he knows that soon, oh, soon, perhaps in three or four picnics time, he will have enough tin to fashion for himself a suit of 10 armor, fitting him from squirrely head to Moly toes, and then he will no longer fear the poking of pitchforks, and he will come clattering out from his cubby and raw and bash and back and back and back until each and every one of the horrible bankers of the hamlet of Glebe is lying sprawled upon the green groaning for mercy and it will be a fine day and he will set them on fire. He can everyone just as they set on fire ladybirds at every damn double picnic. And then the blind brute filet Dressler will cast office Groucho can tin armor, and he will straight up into the hills where over many moons he has built a shrine, and he will slump onto his knees before the shrine and pound his fist upon the earth and decline in austrac tones is a total devotion to the ladybird God.

One foul sunlit morning in the late 1950s. Dobson sat at the breakfast table, gazing into space, like a man whose head was entirely vacant. Whatever is the matter Dobson asked the out of print pamphlet is in our merata marigold crew between mouthfuls of boiled cornflakes and ducks liver mush you you While gazing into space, like a man whose head is entirely vacant, on the contrary, my darling dearest pepper the puppet said Dobson. My head is a teeming maelstrom of almost inhumanly complicated thought process to dar. Oh, and have What are you thinking? asked marigold. Well, my little pumpkin. So, as you know, I have recently been reading a rather rereading or rather re rereading the memoirs of the plucky clubfoot fascist taught tiny indeed, and I have been struck by the passage by the passage in which she recounts how she taught herself to execute simultaneously, a parallel and a vault fast. The parallel must have proved tricky with that clubfoot of hers said merry go to. Oh, that was the least of her worries, said Dobson. And as I am sure you recall, tiny Enid was a preternaturally agile taught in spite of her infirmity. Know, the difficulty she had to overcome was to succeed in rotating her physical body 360 degrees at the very same time as making a mental rotation of just 180 degrees. For if you think about it for a moment, or as I have been doing, if you think about it throughout breakfast, the volt fast is but half a payroll act. It's the volt fast continued through 360 degrees, one's mental position would be identical to what it was at the start. Just as in a payroll add one returns to one's original physical position, you say? Yes stops and I grasped that much immediately. That is why I have continued tucking into my breakfast. While you are practically you should eat your motion before it goes cold. I'm quite partial to cold mush, said Dobson. In fact, I think I will leave my bowl and tuck into my breakfast after I have paid a visit to old Mar brimstone ballet school next to the post office where I can brush up on my pirouetting skills. And without another word, the out of print pamphleteer. Dante's it was Becca Stan a yak herders boots and crashed out of the door into a sudden and unexpected downpour, the bright battering sun having vanished behind thunderous black cloud, sweeping across the sky, terrible as an army of Corbin Esther's marching with placards trudging along the towpath of the filthy canal. Dobson turned his mind to considering a topic upon which he might attempt to perform a vote fast, while practicing pirouettes he ran through a series of subject in his head as Tech's bleak, corrugated cardboard dingley Dells, eggs, funk music, geese, geese, geese made him think of swans. And sure enough, just the head upon the canal, elegant yet Savage, he saw a swan Dobson had always hated swans. Well, perhaps he could force himself while spinning around and round Alomar brimstone ballet school next to the post office to spin his mind round, but only halfway round through 180 degrees so that by the time he completed his physical 360 degree parapet he would love swans adore them. It was worth a try. resolute he pressed on through the mud. Several hours later, Dobson crashed through his front door sopping wet just as the clouds dispersed, and the sun reappeared in the sky as bright and battering as Felix Randall, great grade Ray horses sandal. Oh, how about Dobson said marigold ku. How did you get on?

Frank Key  24:24
Remind me never to go near that ballet school next to the post office ever again, cried Dobson. Even if I have to go to the post office. I do not know what qualifications old Mar brimstone possesses, but I very much doubt she ever gained a diploma in the teaching of pirouetting technique. Each time I attempted a pirouetted. While thinking about swans, I lost my balance and toppled over and each time I toppled over, I bashed my head on hard drafting solid something or other beside which I'll mob grimstone insisted I practice. My bonds has suffered so many thumps but my wits are quite, quite burdened, and I cannot remember what I was doing at that confounded Ballet School in the first place. I'm going to go and lie down in a darkened room and wallow in self pity. As Dobson turned away, marigold to reminded him that he had an uneaten bowl of boiled cornflakes and ducks liver mush gone cold. The out of print pamphleteer spun round through a full rotation of 360 degrees. I hate cold mush, he declaimed from whatever perch in an ethereal plane she was looking down upon Dobson the plucky taught tiny Enid applauded him. You say, she whispered through the ether, it can be done a pair of sweat and a volt fat at the same time. But Dobson's brain was shattered, and he remained oblivious to what he had done. And then he toppled over for the umpteenth time that day.
