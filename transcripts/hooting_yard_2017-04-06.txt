Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. How exciting is that? I haven't been around for a couple of weeks what with one thing and another but now I'm back. And the show must go on with going on live as we, as as I speak, you might be speaking to but I can't hear you. And the best thing to do in certain circumstances, is to lie on your side upon the grass in a meadow, and have an acolyte pour vinegar into your ear through a funnel. When you stand up in the middle of the meadow, and tilt your head, shaking it a little, the vinegar will be expelled from your ear and you will feel the benefits. It is important that you have an acolyte who can properly judge the amount of vinegar to pour into your ear too little and the whole exercise is pointless, too much and you will be tilting your head and shaking it until the cows come home and you will find it very difficult to expel all the vinegar. When the cows come home, they may be disconcerted to find you in their Meadow with your tilted head and some of them may become fractures, fractures, cows can be dangerous. So it will help if you have your acolyte armed with some sort of cow protection device. This might be made of corrugated cardboard, or alternatively of tin foil. best to consult a catalogue of cow protection devices beforehand with your acolyte accurate side. Choosing an acolyte to whom you are prepared to entrust the pouring and the cow protection is a fraud business. Believe you me it is a process during which you can expect much heightened emotion, many tears, a certain amount of wailing, and now and then fencing contests with flashing a pays. It has even been known for rival acolytes to bash each other about with spades, so it is advisable not to give them access to the keys to the potting shed. You will probably have at least one set of duplicate potting shed keys hanging from a hook in the pantry. So make sure you keep the pantry out of bounds to your acolytes say for those who needs to enter it to fetch tins of tinned plums and tinned radishes and other tinned goods. It is it is a simple matter to give but one acolyte, the responsibility for the fracturing of tins. And that acolyte can be disqualified from even the possibility of pouring vinegar into your ears in the middle of the cow Meadow while you lie on your side by having him blinded or having his legs broken and confining him in the house. Another thing to bear in mind when choosing the appropriate acolyte is that they must be able to get you from the house to the middle of the meadow with a minimum of fast, fast is corrosive of the soul, and has been known to result in horrible bodily eruptions, such as sores, and boils, and sub curating patches of passing which, in such tender places as the groin and the armpits, you will want a level headed and charming acolyte, one who confronted by menacing geese on the way from the house to the meadow will sue them by singing something by Kevin coin in a deeply lovely voice. geese are usually located in this way, even the most ferocious ones. You will probably want to be carried from the house to the meadow Allah Palin queen. Given your preening self regard, you will thus require additional acolytes to do the carrying one of whom can also be the vinegar pouring acolyte, if you so wish.

It is therefore a very good idea to have some distractions at hand to entertain those who once their carrying is done, have not to do until you come on them to carry you back to the house when you finished when you flush the vinegar out of your ear. Most acolytes can be happy by board games. poopy the Kronstadt rebellion and waiting around in a meadow while vinegar is poured into the air of your hero are splendid and complicated games, using dice counters, and the feathers of placated geese. But of course, there are many other games board based and otherwise, would you make consider packing in your Pipi bag, when making preparations to be carried from the house to the meadow. If you have acolytes who are resistant to the exciting board games, it's probably best to dismiss them with their tails between their legs. As the saying goes. The dismissal of acolytes can be problematic, particularly if they are clinging, clinging, acolytes are known to use GM to affix themselves to fixtures and fittings such as the doors of pantries and the railings bordering manses. beyond your guard against them. rifle fire tends to deter all but the clearest, who may have to be detached from their Gumby emplacement with gum dissolving fluids in spray canisters. When making a purchase of these canisters, you may be asked to fill out a form declaring that they will not be used to dissolve the gum of fixing an acolyte to the ravings of your man's, in these circumstances, just by you will go to hell. But would you rather not be in hell than be subject to the folding of a government acolyte?

Dobson was very fond of his blotter whenever he wrote about it, which was more often than considered normal for a grown man, his prose attains a picture of purple enthusiasm, modern readers can find uncomfortable, not to say distressing. It has been said that the pamphleteer even had a pet name phase blotter as if it weren't an animal being like a puppy or a hamster. But nobody claims to know what it was citation needed, as they say on the Wikipedia. There has been some debate of crushing tedium as to whether Dobson's attachment was to the blotter itself, or to the sheets of blotting paper he inserted under it's for leatherette corner flaps. He made something of a ritual of this, changing his blotting paper every Thursday afternoon, at about four o'clock, just before he had a cup of tea and apply to bloaters. He seems to have inserted a fresh sheet, irrespective of the state of the one to be discarded. As often as not his blotting paper remained pristine, as he almost always wrote in pencil. But use treats he kept in a cardboard box shoved underneath the sink in an outbuilding. Each time he filled the box, he secreted it somewhere like a squirrel and went to who Berman's department store to get a new cardboard box to date nobody has ever discovered where he hid almost boxes of slightly used blotting paper. It is one of the enduring mysteries, beloved of Dobson so the blotter itself was unexceptionable as blotters go, it was a flat leatherette rectangle with corner flaps, under which the four corners of a sheet of blotting paper with tucked. several witnesses have noted that, contrary to what one might expect, the blotter was not always in place on the pamphlet is escrow twapp. Sometimes, he left it leaning upright against the wainscot. At other times, he put it in a bag and carried it around with him for no apparent purpose. It was not unknown for him to eat his bloaters off it or to use it as a bird table. Dobson was fantastically ignorant of the diet of birds though, and would place his blotter on top of an upright stick in the garden, and then scatter hard toffee marbles upon it. Such confectionery was avoided by any little birds alighting on the blotter bird table for rare is the bird which can digest hard toffee, but also risk of breaking them it'll beaked on it, for Dobson's preferred coffee marbles, which we bought in paper bags. From a peddler with a harvest known to humankind, and he gave them an extra bacon in the oven for hours at a time to make them harder still. In a new as yet unpublished book, Pam clog and ravages tell the story of how Dobson's Blotto was stolen, and later recovered. melodramatically, the pamphleteer once described this as the worst week of my entire life on a rambunctious Wednesday, when the Zodiac was in a meaningless alignment, the pamphleteer decided he needed to stiffen the back of his blotter to restore its rigidity. He filled a pail with starch, and carefully lowered the blotter into it, and then he strode off from a vim to blister lay Mido for waterpolo practice. Gibson was a keen if inept player of that most thrilling of a classic team sport. And he wrote a number of pamphlets about it, the best of which is probably a new and improved method of drying your Puck with a towel out of print. In standard Water Polo, of course, parks are not used, but the bliss domain academicals was no ordinary water polo team. Nor was this an ordinary practice on this fateful Wednesday, for the coach wanted the team to try out a new tactic, which involve distracting their opponents by imitating the cause of loons and shoveler ducks and grackles. By the time he returned home, Dobson was hoarse and exhausted, he went straight to the room in which he had left the blotter steeped in a pile of starch, and was distraught to find it gone. The pile itself had been knocked over and the stock had soaked into the floorboards. Here is how Pam blog and lavages describe what happened next.

Dobson cried out, Dobson sobbed. Dobson crashed about the house. Dobson called detective Captain Kirk pan. Dobson told detective Captain Kirk pan that his blotter had been stolen.

Excuse me, Dobson sat in a chair and waited for detective Captain card pad to arrive. Dobson drank a tumbler of milk from a goat. See, Dobson, sit, see Dobson drink. This sort of thing becomes tiresome after a few dozen pages, but I admire the author's attention to detail. Apparently, they won a medal for an earlier book about the Watergate hearings. What we've learned in this new work is that the truth is that the thief was a was a contemptible scoundrel with a pencil moustache, the look of a startled rabbit. A fixation upon blotters a cheap pair of gloves, a corrective boot, or skewed sense of morals, or weak kin, a hacking cough, a sordid past, the width of a drainpipe, a collapsing around a dubious parentage, odd socks and other cravat, bats in his Belfry shares in the Bradford and Bingley building society, corks on his uppers, plums in his pocket, catastrophic measles scars renter is vinegar in his ears and sausages on the brain. Detective Captain card pan tracked him down for days after the theft of Dobson's blotter hiding out in a house of miscreants hard by the banks of Lake foofy. Dobson first words when one of detective Captain Kirk pan's henchmen returned the blotter to him at a Ron diver in a dismal canteen where thank you so much for retrieving my Natty blotter. Studio studious optimists will recognize that as the title of a dirge the pamphleteer composed for the second international Anthony Burgess festival of uncompromising dodges in a room where it one 15th Prize

in today's hooting, your Bottomley lesson, we're going to study a stalk of fattens bladder work. We're going to examine it very very closely with the naked eye, and then under a microscope, and then from an exemplary distance through a telescope. We shall thoroughly snippet having first had our nasal passages cleared and fumigated with a nasal fumigation, siphon and pump contraption specially made for us by a boffin. We are going to test the effect upon it of both extreme heat and extreme cold, as well as room temperature and other exemplary temperatures it is likely to encounter and what can laughingly still be referred to as the real world. Thus far, I have spoken of both distance and temperature as being exemplary, and I'm not finished with my exemplars. We are going to attach electrical wires to the stalk of fattens plan of work and subjected to low and high voltages using a targeted electrical voltage delivery contraption specially made for us by a boffin which will designate one such voltage as an exemplary voltage for reasons which will become apparent. immersion in a tub of water will be the next step. We will be using water from the duck pond, having first boiled it and allowed it to call. The water will be collected from the duck pond in piles, then transferred to a pan. It will be allowed to call in the pan before being poured into the tub through a funnel. Rubber gloves will be worn during this procedure. The color of the rubber gloves worn is open to choice except the light or not be the same color as the stalk of fattens bladder work. A rubber glove pigmentation chart has been specially prepared for us by a boffin and which will refer to it before plumping for our rubber gloves. We will then test the pH value of the stalk of fattens bladder word before breaking for lunch. Lunch will be served in the sixth floor canteen. The prices are reasonable and the queues are short. There is a good reception of pies cereals, chunks of unidentified meat out barley theories from squirrels winter storage, bait turnips, cocoa powder, blood oranges, various animal innards, gravy in boats and gravy in a spoon. plums balsamic vinegar, toffee pudding dentelles calendering biscuits and crackers, clam chowder wafers with a drizzle of light Ale, pastries, dried citrus husks, Bluemont, lemon curd, bogs, sludge and aspirins. The singsong will take place immediately after lunch in the sixth floor canteen annex. Some treats in a bold hectoring type face have been specially prepared for us by a Madrigal list. upon our return we will slice up the stalk of fat and bladder word with a big sharp exempt Clarice micing implement there we will there will then be a test. There will then be a test paper in multiple choice format to be completed in pencil. The rubber gloves should be disposed of down a chute, the location of which will be announced in due time. Any questions?

Our essays don't matter and it refers to it refers to an old piece that appeared on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org. The piece is entitled wooden child and fiery serpent and trees. And there's a picture there. So if you look at the picture, and you search for that, look at the picture and then you'll understand what's going on. You don't really need to see the picture, but you kind of feel like they missed the key. I was minding my own business sitting on my bench in the attic room of the Mersey home for abandoned infants made of wood when my attention was drawn to your article entitled wooden child and fiery serpent and trees. I should at once make it clear that I am a wooden child, and that I often run errands along the very same lines of your baby wick, such as the one shown in the picture, and that on numerous occasions when running such errands, I have been menaced by serpent belching for flame from their mouths, or from their fundament on sometimes terrifyingly from both. Before I go on, you may be interested to know the nature of my errands. From time to time the bees are at the mercy home or one of his lieutenants will require a crate of crab apples or bandages or plums or dust or conference pears or talcum powder or grease or vinegar, caked or marzipan or holy water tablets or pins or assorted crustacea or similar produce to be collected from the village shop. Being the possessor of a withered leg, the beetle himself is not able to undertake the journey along the winding lanes and his lieutenants are kept so busy grouting and lighting and scraping and plugging and patching up holes in the fabric of the Mersey home, but the task falls onto one or another of the abandoned wooden infants such as myself. We merrily do the Beatles billing for old Mar dystopia who runs the village shop will usually treat us with a wooden biscuit or a wooden toffee apple before getting us to sign the impost for the crate we have come to collect. She is a kindly old soul, who is reputed to be over 200 years old and to have taken part in many folk tales. Living actually does in her ramshackle shop deep in the dense and gloomy woods. She is certainly a keen observer of the disposition of trees. What prompted me to write to you was your observation that the wouldn't tie knees you rescue from perilous, fiery serpent a skittish and you are rarely rewarded or thanked for your endeavors. Now it is true enough that I do not recall a single occasion when menaced by a serpent or this or that on this or that errand. My ex in my impairment had been averted by you, or indeed anyone like you emerging from the shrubbery armed with a portable fire extinguisher. Granted that my memory is not the most acute given my head and all its innards, including the brain aren't like the rest of me made of wood. Yet I feel quite sure I would remember so stirring an incident. As it is, I've always had to affect my own deliverance from the threat of fiery serpents upon the lanes using a combination of quick wits and wily stratagems. I'm not lucky enough to carry my own fire extinguisher. Partly because I am on my return journey at least laden with a crate of produce of us hard put to carry anything extra. And also because the Beagle is reluctant to let his tiny wooden karges get their hands on his one fire extinguisher, which we keep bolted to the wall of his office. It's not the case that we're too skittish to be entrusted with it. By the way, rather, the Beagle is a possessive and neurotic man pray to his own secret inner demons, for which I fervently hope he will one day seek professional counseling or acupuncture or even just straight forward puncturing with a sharpened skewer. My main point is that if ever there came a time when you did spray your so called exciting fire suppressant foam into the mouth, or the fundament of a fiery serpent way laying me upon the line. I would certainly be profuse in my thanks and would Upon my return to the Mercy Home for abandoned infants made of wood, hold urgent discussions with the beetle to arrange for you to be properly rewarded, perhaps with a lemon meringue pie or a box of paper clips.

I'm confident that my wouldn't fellows would do the same. So I can only assume when you assert that it is rare for you to be thanked or rewarded for your efforts. But the wouldn't children you have assisted in the past, past hail from some other home for wooden children, perhaps one that nestled even deeper in these deep and gloomy woods, a home where the wooden children are, God forbid, skittish wooden, ingrates. I hope you will see fit to publish this Alexa, auto read it out on your radio show. And that's to set the record straight, passionately yours a nameless wooden child

So glorious, the large door behind it one Prince in one palace, a caged bird in a bird cage, ruffled feathers and one cardboard box on its side. Clever men with enormous brains next to an armoire. Some might have areas by puppetry, there are pianos and machine guns. There is one Prince, there is a shadow line with a wooden leg. There is a caged bird in a bird cage. There is blood on the rug. There is a cake in the cake in the pantry. There are candles on the cake. A clever man with an enormous brain has put a cardboard box over his head and electricity has been installed. Jasper in overalls, millet strewn under the birdcage, echoes of chivalry or typhoid, weeping widow in widow's weeds behind an heiress weeping. Also wooden leg wood from Bannister railings, interior railings be damned. breadcrumbs in the millet intricate wiring courtesy of Jasper shatter by doxygen oxygen pump, a vows of genetically modified loopings such tiny lupins such a hysterical Prince, one Prince without a cardboard box, the throwing of fits that tie deist annex the marmalade less louder grief embroidered on a pin cushion tallow candles gutted a worm in the birthday cake, slime and cobwebs near the clever man at the armoire.

There is a freak thunderstorm, a bat was seen one bat in one sky in one hour, baffled gunfire of the hills and far away just by running with scissors, the shadow lines of egg hankering for its balcony. Terrible get in this of the prince.
