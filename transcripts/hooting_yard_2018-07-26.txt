Now currently listening to resonance 104 point four FM, London's premier art station.

Frank Key  00:30
This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frankie and this is hooting yard on the air. The closest thing on radio to a near death experience. So well it is for me anyway. I'm too hot. I am too hot. And because I'm so hot. The piece I'm going to read to you is probably wishful thinking. Berber wrap up warm because it's cold outside. Well, it would be Wouldn't it it being the Ice Age. There have been other ages stone and iron for example and bronze, but this one we have dubbed the ice age because it's so chilly. Sitting here next to my oil stove, wearing various furry animal pelts. It's easy to forget just how cold it is outside. I can't see through the windows, because they're all rusted up. But I suppose if I turned down the volume on the cassette player, I would be able to hear the howling winds of the blizzard and they would serve to remind me of the cold but I would rather listen to the cassette playing pop tones quite frankly, I'm not in the right mood for howling the wind howls and soda wolves. Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish one kind of howling from the other. Wolves seem to thrive in the chilly chilly weather of the Ice Age. They have furry coats, of course, or at least Harry bristly coat. Oh Nat corral, as it were. To obtain my furry pelt, I have to slaughter apt creatures, or at least get someone to do so for me to slaughter and skin and stick. I am somewhat weedy and short sighted and I would much rather huddled by the oil stove listening to pop tones than be out there in the cold hunting and stalking. In any case, I do not have a pair of snowshoes and I wouldn't get very far. Within a few feet of my door I expect I will be up to my waist in snow and helpless and I would have to make puny cries in the hope that a tough won't hunter would come to my rescue. At least you know where you are with Wolves. Bo's rampaging wild boars are another matter entirely, belie me. I've been woken from a nap by the sound of them, battering their tusks against the walls of my heart. I'm pretty sure it was a wild boar. Covered in hoarfrost the truth that Sorry. I'm pretty sure it was a wild boar covered in hoarfrost that crew through the wiring of my radio set. I thought the wiring was safe, submerged in under the snow, stretching out across the top Kuta but those bores are relentless. Now I can only get some of the channels and some of the music ones, which is why I rely on the cassette player. I say music is pretty grim old told, but when the alternative is the howling of wolves and wind and the bashing of both tusks against the walls, you have to take what you can get. And it's not all bad. I grew quite fond of kept those icicles tymphany for example, but the tape was ruined when I left it too close to the oil stove. And it partly melted. So now I make do with pop tones. I see pop tones with lots of synthesizer at top volume. It drowns out the howling. I used to have a pair of snowshoes Of course I did for how else would I have been able to cross the top pooter and make it to my heart. It took me six weeks to get here plodding slowly. I meant to hang on to them for emergencies, but they fiber they were made from with highly flammable and one evening the oil stove spat out of stray sparks which ignited them. I acted quickly putting on a pair of mittens and I'm cracking the burning snowshoes out of the door.

into a snowdrift. If I hadn't the whole hat would have burned down and I'd have been a gunner. But it means that now I have to rely on passing wolf hunters for certain essentials. They can be a difficult lot. I got so fed up with the rampaging wild boars battering their tusks against the walls that I thought I'd fashion some kind of bought trap. I asked one of the wolf hunters for help. In return for soup. I hoped he would dig a pit outside a few feet away from the door into which the boars might topple and having toppled perish. The rascal ate my soup that said he was a wolf only hunter and couldn't be distracted in his career by digging a pit for balls. He was huge and violent, so I didn't argue I may no longer have the icicle Symphony to listen to, but I have plenty of icicles by hanging from the ceiling and there are hundreds and occasionally I pluck one off to suck or to use as a little spear. Sometimes I will use the same article for both spearing and sucking turn and turn about until my sacking has made it useless for spearing. The icicles are a bit too big to use as pins. And funnily enough, I've discovered I have absolutely no need of pins here in my heart. I've got along quite well without a single pin. That surprised me. But there it is. Apart from the fiendish cold. The reason I don't go out much is fear. Call me namby pamby but I'm terrified of the twin perils of snow blindness and peerblock to the wolves and the rampaging wild boars, I think I could handle using a combination of mesmerism and gibberish. But neither of these is of much use. Whether ruination of one's eyes and one's mind is at stake. I have noticed that the wolf hunters all seem to be equipped with very nasty sunglasses, which presumably protect them against snow blindness. Whether they have something similar to God their brains, I do not know. They're not a talkative lot. Oh, they will gobble them the soup you profit them, but that's as far as it goes. On one of the radio stations I'm still able to pick up I heard the other day that the Ice Age might be coming to an end. Some pundit in the studio was Wittering on about all the snow melting across the top pooter for as far as the eye could see, revealing a buried landscape of VISTA of salt flat. It sounded to me as if his vision was a little different from the snowbound Land of the Ice Age. But I suppose if it does get warmer, I might go out from time to time though I'm not sure to what purpose I don't put salt in my soup. I never have

my special guest this week as often the size his parents he cradled you take it away pansy.

Unknown Speaker  08:29
Oh, well thank you for that. I was also referred to on the previous show pull the plug as a various character which I quite like I think will be a various character more often. I did ask Mr. Kay if I could go next as it were because I thought I'd warm us up a little with a wonderful offering from the great late great I hasten to add Norman Davies, and this is Pacific Islands. That Far West Fiji is rugged lava to screen, fat fierce cannibals. firewalking refined Indians, blue ice, blood sunset.

On Golden Pond. I look there's Henry thunder and Katharine Hepburn in a rowing boat. They're both dead on in their graves of course. But here On Golden Pond they or rather their shade, drift forever. There is a similar pond in Paris, where you will be able to spot cadmium and Sophie and Olivier from Selena and Julie go boating. Similarly drifting in their running boat forever and ever. Some ponds attract ghosts in their boats. There is nothing intrinsically eerie about such ponds. If you were to go for a walk around while on a summer's day, tracking from a scrunched up paper bag sharp shreds of style bred to ducks. And you did not spot Henry Fonda or Katharine Hepburn or Camille or Sophie or Olivier. What should I say their shades I keep forgetting then you would not think the pond a haunted pond. Having fed the ducks you would deposit the empty paper bag in a waste bin and go home all I know where it might well be that just as you turn your back on the pond to head for home. That's precisely the moment when the rowing boat will appear from behind the overhanging foliage perhaps, and in the boat, glassy eyed and spectral the shades. Some ask why it is that the shades stay put in ponds freed from mortal moorings. Why do they not? Why do they not take their rowing boats to a river and run out to sea? Yes upon this stale and serene whereas the sea can be a wild seedings storm tossed uproarious kerning Maelstrom, but that'll hold no terrors for the shades. Surely Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn and Camille and Sophie and Olivier are beyond all such care. They have faced the greatest of all terrorists and past beyond into the realm of ghosts. And as ghosts in their rowing boats by could roll and roll through even the most violent of seas until they came alongside a ghost ship. For we know there are many ghost ships out upon the ocean. They could still grow in their boat if they wanted to. But they would also have the larger canvas of a sailing ship on which to paint their gaudy pictures of the hereafter. The reason the shades stay upon their family ponds is for safety. For whereby to take their boats to a river and drift upstream towards the sea, then close by the sea they would meet with coastal to bats. Kara can still strike the shades and it does so in the form of the bat. Now you understand why Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn and Camille and Sophie and Olivier know their shades shades stay far inland upon ponds. Golden Pond or a Parisien pond remote from mec. As their name implies, the coastal to bats can never stray far from the coast. They haunt the meetings of land and sea and when they sense with their exceptionally good eyesight, the approach on the river of drifting rowing boats freighted with shades Ah, then Tara is wreaked a flock of coastal to bats will descend upon the boat, horrifying bats with grizzled dorsal coloration and conical faces, and they will hoist the shade out of the boat and drag them dozens of bat carrying shade to a to a tune by the coast on a promontory overlooking the sea as it Whitby and the shade will be dropped in a tube and the tube fall shot forever. And then they will never again be any drifting upon placid Golden Pond for Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, nor upon a Parisien pond that Camille and Sophie and Olivier and if you go to feed the ducks from the scrunched up paper bag of shreds of stale bread, you will see no shade, but perhaps if it drifts from behind overhanging foliage, an empty rowing boat

Frank Key  16:27
in the Hereafter, as in the here, nothing is ever as straightforward as it might be. It is not the case that a rowing boat shade, tired of its pond and hankering for the vastness of the open sea, is fated always to fall into the clutches of coastal to bat. The bats can be outwitted, and the shade desperate perhaps to embark upon a ghost trip can avoid a terrible entombment in a coastal grave. For there are other bat Peters 10th, making bat which will fly to the shades assistance, weather the 10th making bats do this knowingly or inadvertently is a moot point, but they do what they do, and the shade can find a measure of safety even at the coast. For it's a curious thing that even with their piercing eyesight, the total two bats cannot pay us the fabric of the 10th made by the 10th making bats the brave unfortunate shade drifting downriver towards the sea. fearful of the predations of coastal tune bats will keep a sharp if glassy eye out for signs of an encampment of Peters tempt making bats tense. If the shade spot one, it can drift to shore and tie its running boat to a ghost post and shimmer quickly to attend, and so hide from within the tent, the lapping of sea against shore can be heard, and the shade is comforted. For some shades. This is enough and they settled in the tent by the shore. Somehow one imagines that this might suit Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn their shades but not Camille and Sophie and Olivier their shades. The domestic melodrama played out by the trio will be all the more harrowing within the confines of a bat tent. By a no doubt happier drifting on their Parisien pond. But if a tent by the sea is not enough, and the desire to board a ghost ship overwhelming How is the shape to make it safely from 10th to see, the coastal to bats are forever watchful. Alas, there is not a third type of bat which serves as an escort to ferry the shades in safety. Nigeria has not provided one the shade must risk all in a desperate flight at a time when the coastal tune bats baby sleeping, a flight back to the tide up rowing boat, and thence rowing heave ho, not drifting must make as rapidly as possible for open sea in hopes of a welcoming ship. Is it as easy it is easy to see why some shades stay on their palms. Look, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn are drifting in their rowing boat behind overhanging foliage On Golden Pond. Did you see them?

Frank Key  19:59
Excuse me. I just wanted to point out that Peters 10th making bat is a real type of backed. But I made up the coastal to bat release I think I did might be better real bat as well. Anyway, here's something else. The sky at night is darker than the sky during the day. You probably know why this is the case, so I'll not bother explaining it to you. twinkling stars visible in the dark sky at night seem to vanish in the daylight. But of course they're still there in their appointed places. Only a nick would think otherwise. It's simply that they do not twinkle in the daytime. They save that for the night, when they can help nocturnal travelers find their way. Such a traveler would of course have to have some idea of what he was looking at neck art to pair up the night sky, he would need to have a practical ability to discern patterns. Otherwise, the myriad stars can look like a chaotic splattering of twin flames across the sky. If all the traveler sees is chaos is likely to get lost. For at night The sky is dark, and there is little light. And many of the signs and landmarks he may use to orient himself in the daytime cannot be seen clearly. But if when he looks up at the stars, he is confounded by the sight that is not going to help him. So if in the night you are wending your way home and you meet a traveler who is lost, you can play the Good Samaritan by explaining the patterns to him. You might even have stuffed into your pocket, a map or a diagram of the stars. And this you can give to the traveler or you might want to send it to him if you are panelists, and he is not. But let us say you are the traveler, the star ignorant fellow abroad in the night when you would be better off tucked up in bed. We can only guess that your reasons for being out and about plunged in darkness without a clue where you are. Perhaps you set out on a mission of mercy or on an errand so urgent it could not wait until daybreak, or you may have been suddenly overcome with wonder lost and crashed out of the door in the middle of the night without even stopping to put on your boots. Something similar happened to my maternal grandfather. He came home from the pub one night in Ghent in Belgium in 1936. Fired with drunken revolutionary zeal and determined to go and fight in the Spanish Civil War. It is possible of course, to walk directly from Belgium to Spain, and so without giving it further thought he crashed out of the door of his house in hard status craft in Ghent in the middle of the night. It is unlikely that he had a star map to guide him. The precise route he took is unknown, but a couple of days later, he woke up in a Belgian ditch with a fever and was brought home. In our hypothetical situation, you are the last traveler abroad in the night. We shall try to save you from the ditch. baffled by the stars in the sky. You're having second thoughts about your mission of mercy or urgent errand, or wonder lost or fighting talk. Whenever sudden you make a local person when being his familiar way home. He is a good samaritan and takes from his pocket a map of the stars. But he is a penulis Good Samaritan and he wheedled out of you an outrageous price for the map. Armed with it however, you are burning with confidence that you will be able to find your way. So you consider it money well spent. The Samaritan disappears into the shadows and you're left standing on the lane or in the field. You unfold the star map and gaze at it and then look up at the twinkling stars in the sky. You look from map to Sky to map to Sky to map to sky and try to correlate the two and realize you're holding the map the wrong way round. You turn it and try the correlation again. Now you are able to spot certain patterns alignment of twinkling, which seems similar, if not quite identical upon the map and in the sky. You are you think getting somewhere

Frank Key  25:01
I'm afraid to say you're getting nowhere. So deep seated is your star ignorance that you're faced with the myriad chaos of stars splattered across the sky, and the myriad chaos of pencil markings splattered across the paper. The fact that you've identified similarities between the two makes them no less chaotic. Indeed, it might be said that all you have achieved is to double the chaos. The best thing you can do now is to walk until you find a date and lie down in the ditch and rue the cost of the map and fall asleep until daybreak. You will when you wake regret that you paid so little attention when you were a taught to the astronomy lessons given by Dr. Von Straub and z in the cold bleak Village School room. The sky at night is darker than the sky during the day. splattered across the sky are teeming billions of twinkling stars so far away that you would be very very old or more likely dead before you ever reached them. Even in the fastest and most advanced Space Age intergalactic Voyager guys at them in the night, gays and gays until you have learned their allotted places their appointed courses. Learn their disposition across the firmament so well that you can draw their positions with pencil on paper from memory. Where now you see chaotic splattering, learn to see patterns and alignment. Learn the stars, and the sky at night will be your guide. Those were the words of Dr. Von straubing z to which you did not listen. preoccupied. You were with tiddlywinks and crumple that blotting paper and other childish things. Had you listened. You would not like my grandfather be sprawled in a ditch at daybreak in the Belgian rain. And just as just as the Peters tent making bath is real, and everything else was made up. So the bits there about my Belgian grandfather are all entirely true. He did in fact go off drunkenly at night to fight in the Spanish Civil War and made it about two miles out of Ghent way toppled into a ditch. We're nearly at the end of this week show not just this week's show, but this season's coming to an end. It's the season finale of hooting yard where we back in September, I think. But so for all it's always time to say thank you for listening. Thank you to john for engineering. And we'll end with pansy cradle Joe who I think has something else to read to us to take us to the end of the show.

Unknown Speaker  28:17
Let's leave off for our summer break with a bit of Mr. Key shorter potted, brief, brief lives. This is john Hanning speak, English explore 1827 to 64. One night, when speak was searching for the source of the Nile. his tent became infested with small black beetles. He was awakened by one of them crawling into his ear, where it began with exceeding vigor, like a rabbit in a hole to dig violently away at my tympanum the queer sensation this amusing measure excited in me his past description, speak to tried and failed to flush the beetle out with melted butter, then dug into his ear with his pen knife. He killed but did not manage to remove the insect and the resulting infection twisted his face caused boils made him almost deaf and a two hole between his ear and his nose when he blew his nose, my whistle when he blew his nose. My air was sealed so audibly that those who heard it laughed. Now there is a cautionary tale for you. Stay away from small black beetles.
