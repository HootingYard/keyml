She is the patron saint of French pop singer mirre macchia. Who knew that pop singers had their own patron saint?

Next up this week, you'll all be waiting with bated breath for chapter seven of Mr. Keys, bumper book of birds a work in progress. And I've read the previous six chapters on the show. And chapter seven is in fact the only other one I've written so far. As I said, it's a work in progress it may take years or even decades. So, Mr. Keys bumper book of birds chapter seven, the cow the cow is a type of bird. It's also known as the misprint bird, because by rights there should be an R between the C and the O, to make Crow and in do biteable bird. What's happened is that certain slapdash ornithological writers who skimp on proofreading have given cow where they mean crow. The error is more common in written than in verbal ornithology and the latter the varying pronunciations of the letter O, tend to alert even the most misty brained bird expert to the difference. In cow, the O is pronounced as in owl, the exclamation you make when, for example, a crow lights on your head and pecks at your scalp with its sharp, fearsome beak in order to gobble up the various little beetles and creepy crawlies and breadcrumbs scattered in your Buffon because you haven't bothered to wash your hair for several weeks. In crow on the other hand, the O is pronounced as in the surname of Satan. pasty and CO, the high speed Olympic champion, better known phase wrestling bouts with William Hague MP in the gymnasium of the Houses of Parliament. Interestingly, if we substitute the wrestlers initial see for a K, thus, CO, k, e, we arrive at the Flemish word for cow. In that case however, it's well to bear in mind that the O in the Flemish CO is pronounced like the O in qu, which is the sound made by doves and pigeons, and various other birds. You can see how this all hangs together. Only a nitwit would think a cow was actually a bird, as opposed to being a misprint, bird. cows have neither beaks nor feathers, nor wings nor talons, nor are they capable of flight. It is true that there is a nursery rhyme in which a cow jumps over the moon, and that high leaping can in some circumstances be mistaken for flying. It is possible that the rhyme was originally transcribed by a slapdash ornithologist who skimped on proofreading. And what was meant was, the cow flew over the moon sorry, the crow flew over the moon. Visually, you might see a crow flying over the moon, depending on your angle of view, from your position in a muddy field on Earth, in relation to both the cow sorry, the Crow and the moon. Though it's not often one sees a crow flying around the sky at night, a time when most crows are fast asleep in their nests. Cows on the other hand, do not make nests. They sleep in cow buyers.

Mufti on hounds ditch, my phone lay in wait. Photos are often described as implacable, but I could not say that about my phone. In spite of our vendetta persisting through several generations, my phone for the most part let me be he did not dog my every footstep brandishing a stiletto and waiting the opportunity to this great me. years might go by without my cackling even a whiff of his existence. Yet I knew he was somewhere out there, that our enmity was scorching to the soul, and that one day he would strike so I was prepared. I did not carry a stiletto myself. I took the precaution of wearing much padding under my outward apparel. So were my photos stab at me with his stiletto in broad daylight on hounds dick, with a cry of vengeance. The blade would meet, not flesh, but soft cushioning material, straw and hay and impacted wall all blended together. Though I am thin, even rakish within the padding gave me the appearance of a proper fatso. And I waddled and got lumped along the streets. One such street with handstitch, where I had an appointment to meet a man about a dog. I was under the impression It was a Whippet. So I was none too pleased to learn it was another type of dog entirely. I berated the dog person using intemperate language. As I flail my arms, he revealed himself as my phone in musty and took from his pocket his stiletto. With a cry of vengeance on his soundstage, he stabbed at me twice, thrice. But of course, I came to no harm by dint of my padding. I gave him a clean, decent sock on the jaw and he crumbled upon the paving.

Frank Key  14:34
I unbuttoned my coat and my shirt and I deposited the padding the straw and hay and impacted wall upon my phone. I hoped it might suffocate him in hound stage, and I sashayed off thin and sprightly to the snack bar for a snack. Before I reached the snack bar, however, the heavens opened, rain fell in southern Torrance. There were several booming The claps and I was struck by lightning. As I lay sprawled, my Buffon frazzled and sticking out in all sorts of directions, the dog, which had followed me, a tiny, white, petulant Japanese dog yanked in my face. There was no mistaking the meaning of that jack. I swore vengeance upon my phone.

You'll be aware that for centuries, alchemists tried to discover the secret of the philosopher's stone that would transmute base metal into gold. And I think we do lots of other things. may even have conferred immortality upon humans. Anyway, the Philosopher's Stone was the great holy grail of the alchemists. And I was surprised to learn recently that it secret was in fact discovered in 1653. I'll read you a paragraph from Edmond Goss's, monograph on Sir Thomas Brown. I think I read some of it last week about badges. This is not about badges. This is about alchemy. And the Ashmole referred to in the paragraph is the is Elias Ashmole, who was the founder of the Ashmolean Museum or Ashmolean Museum. The other person mentioned Backhouse. I can't remember back houses first name, but anyway that back house and Ashmole and the Philosopher's Stone and this is what happened. In 1653, the dying Backhouse had whispered to Ashmole syllable by syllable that true and innermost secret of the philosopher's stone. This would have been a more impressive event, if Backhouse had not come to life again for nine more years, and if Ashmole had not, meanwhile, forgotten the formula.

Here's another little posse biography not by not not from my book, but from john sutherlands, the lives of the novelist, which was published in 2011. Very good book it is to the posse biographies in that book are much longer than the very, very brief lives in my book. But here's a little little snippet of at Kenneth Graham, the author of the Wind in the Willows. And it raises more questions than it answers, I think, but see what you think. The marital life of the Grahams became unco Xia by the year elsebeth. Elspeth seldom got up before 11 often went to bed in her clothes. Much of the time she spent on her divan, sipping hot water. She, she ate practically nothing, and mouse nests proliferated in the larder. She put Kenneth into special underwear, which was only changed once a year. It is perhaps not surprising that he took a long solitary walk every day. I'm fascinated by that. She put Kenneth into special underwear make you wonder what the underwear was and why he was only able to change it once a year. Still Stranger things have happened. And another little snippet there was a story in the paper the other day about a new breakthrough in the development of AI or artificial intelligence. My own view is that if boffins want to create a machine that convincingly apes a human being, they also concentrate on a s or artificial stupidity. I can imagine a big, lumbering, clanking robot, which, when hidden behind a screen would engage in a conversation which experts would be hard to tell from the barbaric grunting of the average person in the street. At least the street around where I live.

And now some more of my shorter potted brief brief lives. Awesome matron well schreiter I don't know if it's matron or makan, ma C A g n. I've always pronounced it matron but I may be wrong. Anyway, Arthur my general makan wealth writer 1863 to 1947 matron believed we are much mistaken if we think that there is in ultimate reality, any such thing as a cow. Olivia Manning, English novelist 1908 to 1980. at a party, john Gielgud knelt at the feet of Olivia Manning, and told her he wanted to pay homage to her literary genius. Her reply with the moan that she could not hear a word he was saying, because the party was far too noisy. She hated most other writers, and had a particular animus against Iris Murdoch, because, quote, she looked as if she cut her own hair with a hacksaw. Katherine Mansfield, New Zealand writer 1888 to 1923. Suffering from tuberculosis, Katherine Mansfield hope for a cure by going to stay at T i Good grief Institute for the harmonious development of man in Fontainebleau. She arrived in October 1922. The Guru and one time carpet salesman had her cropping up carrots in the middle of the night and sleeping when he allowed her to sleep in a loft above the cow balm, reasoning that the heavy stench of gathered cows would benefit her. She was dead by January Mount sidetone Chinese Communist Party Chairman 1893 to 1976 mouth never brushed his teeth nor took a bath or a shower when he became grubby. A factotum was employed to rub him down with hot towels. Wilfred Martins Belgian politician 1936 to 2013 Martins pointed out something very, very true. He said. You can't say I'll try to think like a Belgian. You either have it or you haven't. Harriet martineau, English writer and social theorist 1802 to 1876 so terrified was Harriet martineau by the prospect of premature burial, that she gave her doctor 10 pounds as advanced payment for the amputation of her head before interment. Mary bless it Virgin Mother of Christ, one BC to one ad, I'm not sure where I got those dates from that doesn't sound right at all. They must be wrong. Anyway, Mary whenever she lived. In 2009, the Vatican issued helpful guidance for those who see a vision of the Virgin Mary. Anyone who claims to have seen an apparition of the Virgin Mary will only be believed as long as they remain silent and do not caught publicity over their claims. If they refuse to obey, this will be taken as a sign that their claims are false. The visionaries will very be visited by a team of psychiatrists, either atheist or Catholic to certify their mental health. While theologians will assess the content of any heavenly messages to see if they contravene church teachings. If the visionary is considered credible, they will ultimately be questioned by one or more demonologists and Exorcist to exclude the possibility that Satan is hiding behind the apparitions in order to deceive the faithful.

Mavis is the sister of philosopher Henry Henri Bergson, was accused 18 months after her death of killing myth netta for Mario by black magic. It was said, Mona's Spirit had appeared in the form of a monster cat and attacked the unfortunate netta. However, the scratches on the corpse were more likely the results of running naked in the dark over Rough Country, which Miss for Norio had been doing immediately before her collapse. Francesca Mati Swiss animal communication expert birth date unknown when a cow named Yvonne went missing in barberia in 2011, those concerned for her welfare were grateful to Francisca Mati, who was in telepathic communication with her. I spoke to Yvonne yesterday, she said, and she said that she was fine, but didn't feel ready to come out of hiding. She said she knew that Ernst had been waiting for her, but she was scared. She said she thought that humans would lock her up, and she would no longer be free. Ernst was a bull with a deep baritone move, even was eventually found and taken to a cow sanctuary. And finally, the Duke Massara French soldier and nobleman 1642 to 1713 Massara had a series of visions which convinced him he was a tulip.

In 1964, McCartney and his fellow Beatles were banned from performing in Israel.
