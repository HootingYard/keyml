Greetings listeners. This is indeed hooting yard. My name is Frank key and I'm going to read to you for about 28 and a half minutes or something like that. Yes, well I'm going to begin with this week with a story from the last century, which originally appeared in a in an out of print pamphlet called tales of Hoon, there were four tales. I should point out to younger listeners that back in 1987 none of us had ever heard of the ludicrous ex MP Jeff hoon. Hence, I wouldn't have used that title I think if who had been so famous. Anyway, this story is called a lecture delivered in the big tent at hoon. Good evening, I find it difficult to express how pleased I am to see so many of you gathered here squatting on rough hewn wooden stalls, and how glad nichy it is that most of you have managed to bring along a fine selection of farm implements, as they may well come in useful as illustrative material later on, if I managed to fit in the audience participation segment of my lecture. But there may not be time, we have to be out of the tent at 930 as apparently it's needed for a big display of pencil crushing equipment. Still, we have until when so let me waste no more time burbling preliminaries clears throat seldom have criminality and wickedness been better personified than by karpin and flub the evil jubo whose careers I wish to address this evening. Let me begin by outlining the pan Jan drums. I'm sorry, that doesn't mean anything. shuffles papers. Let me begin by reading from the judges summing up at copings trial. And our quote karpin has suffered torture is best left to the imagination. drawn his breath in shaking sobs. Turn the animals loose and has a power that men no not. He held the boards for seven terrible weeks, he burned fish. Approaching the startled cellist he was seen grinding the pressure ridges smashing great blocks of ice. He did not have time to rest at the corral under some sheets of votes and very snugly wrapped, he dropped his biscuit. Soon he was dreaming of all sorts of extraordinary things. I saw him lift a man by the seat of government rub down his horse and feed him apples. He even went so far as to hire a top rig buggy to take a little spin along the banks of foreign streams procuring big booty, and professing to be a detective. It was indeed a wild Sabbath night. karpin was furious with rage. One foot upon the iron rail, an enormous net of steel and his pack pony became visible. The time of winter dog travel was now approaching the earth gritty and metallic could have bid on a gondola living rooms flanked the peristyle and webs of incandescent tubular lamps. Shawna head of the damp gray relics karpin track down reports of locust swarms he honked twice slipped beneath the sea, went to work on a huge pile of food and tore up the lettuce, his pouch folding his rattling became a sizzling. Even the nearby gravel crushers were keenly aware of karpin bone fingering embedded in mud gently in order not to raise clouds of booze he blocked it's incredible wrote sledge and ox who've caught an official curve or pumped into the expensive bicycle crates. He touched up the ginger facade decked his troublesome horse and tampered no more with the tin roof in fear and chaos under a bridge or a water tower. He became dusty blue with age, like a sheet like rugs, like concrete piles driven and steel strong.

Drying hazelnuts, this evil man on the screen porch with a syrup bottle provided by his hostess, punched, drilled and reached a fine convenient perch. He kept a boat wins. He clapped a boson whistled through his lips straddling the opposite slope, but his heart was seized by poisonous timber. In a modest salt box structure of leaded casement he brought a big kettle of Quahog berry candles safely passed rocks made in Congress by a regulator in a dying wind. There are examples of restoration one wooden thumb with left foot thrust forward and in summer often charmless to converse with distant sheep. karpin thundered past burning However, he liked it better than merely Primrose, blown by an icy blizzard. He'd been trying out hemp and its byproducts, twine matting and sacks. on the lawn, the seeming anachronism of copings indigenous cable plate politely softened the blue invalid jetty. He placed the wire cone with it point aimed at strewn torrents, and a rack and pinion Railway, harder rarefied tremendous. On the Seminole formidable enough for karpin it was the end.

I think that speaks for itself as evidence of kerbin monstrous calumny. Of course, there was the usual small detachment of wishy washy poltroon who said that the judges sentence was too harsh. But what on earth you do with a man like that, except put him into a big iron pot and send it catapulting into the stratosphere? We come into his wily accomplice flub in the public mind flood, one greater sympathies and karpin were coping with seemed to be riddled with infestations of abominable wickedness. flood was perhaps merely a cretinous apprentice. But is this true? Let's take a look at the catalog of crimes which flub committed before that fateful meeting with karpin at the base works. Once again, my sources the trial transcript. Be it known that the said flub has confessed to the following stupendously wicked deeds, abnormal behavior in the Botanical Gardens bamboozlement of the grossest kind, clutching a bag of wheat husks in his sweaty fist, dental irregularities, employment of minors for the purpose of illicit gurgling, forging railway timetables, glowing in the dark, hooting at elderly farmyard animals, implacable dribbling, jumping off wooden crate missing a quite disgusting balaklava leaning against the zoo, malfeasance and a charnel house not paying corkage oddly shaped boots, pouring forth incandescent light in a public place. quietude when surfing, rip cage abuse, skulking about very suspiciously Tara diddle and ergot uprooting foliage with his teeth, very violent horseplay, wiggling unnecessarily in a lab, x raying entire continent without permission, yodeling or bought a tractor zest for crumpled, bristly things. The list goes on, but time is tight, we must continue a pace. It's obvious then that flub was as much a villain and a theme does his partner if not more, so, indeed, a careful examination of his brain tissue. At this point, the speaker suddenly hosts a lof a plastic bag for glue would show us I do apologize. He replaces the bag in his pocket. Sorry about that. He wipes his hands on his youth. Sorry. A careful examination of the diaries kept by the two men during their reign of terror would show us that if anything, flub was the real mastermind, karpin merely doing his bidding in exchange for a boiled sweet a pencil case or some other little token of appreciation. Is it possible then, that the public image the public perception of the two fiends is awry, that a monstrous injustice has occurred. You will recall that flub was not sentenced to be put into a big iron pot, et cetera, et cetera? No, the judge decided that he was a poor misled urchin who deserved a second chance that it was that he was banished to a pompous land thousands of miles away to down flags and buff up ceremonial shields with a frayed rag. So far as any of us know, he remains there, doubtless continuing to clot in order literally foul crimes or does he? I am now able to confirm what some of us have long suspected that flub has decamp from his banishment and is even as I speak here among us in hoon. The speaker flourishes a grubby piece of paper. I hold in my hand, a letter from this Hound of hell. Allow me to read it to you.

Dear valdemar, it begins I never cease to be astonished by the head qdros of hoon. Where else could once he topiary so enigmatic, so imperious? Ah, how I missed them in that pompous land of my exile, where the hedges were dappled with pinks, foxgloves and many other flowers I know not beauty as they were, I yearned to see the head rows of my hometown in all their magnificence. I have at last began work on my magnum opus, topiary and miscegenation, sorting out 10 years worth of scribbled jottings, Notes and references. It's tough work, but rewarding for all that. I eat only little drink even less and can hardly bear to sleep. My mind is on fire with incalculably evil schemes of iniquity and mayhem, most of which I hope to put into practice within the next fortnight, God willing, as I write the evening like shimmers around me, and tiny winged things fluffer about my head. I feel that I am enveloped by a transit sentence stillness, as if someone had bashed in my skull with an ads light. incandescence, Grace, I may yet find grace. It signed passionately yours flub an intriguing document I'm sure you'll agree. Naturally, I submitted it to a barrage of forensic tests to confirm its authenticity. It appears to be genuine. All I have yet to subject it to the final test, the most trustworthy one. I speak of course of the bails Frampton experiment, only recently developed it visually most attractive, so I thought it might be a rather stimulating climax to my lecture. Please Don your goggles, you'll find them naturally under your stools. At this point, the speaker construct an immense panoply of esoteric Bakelite equipment on the dais. Don's goggles, equipment was hums, shoot sparks etc. He carries out the bails Frampton experiment on the grubby sheet of paper, he removes his goggles. Apparently this is a genuine document. In other words, flub has eluded his keepers and returned to whom a criminal genius works once again in our mix. You may now remove your goggles. Well, that appears to be all we have time for. I'm afraid. I'm being just stipulated that by the janitor. Thank you so much. Are there any questions very quickly. A member of the audience poses a question. The speaker Pat's his jacket pocket. melodramatically. Thank you. Indeed. What is this bag of goo in my pocket, which I suggested was the vile jelly of flubs brain. Haha. I'm still being just stipulated that mother janitor and most pertinent question if I may say so. The janitor is still gesticulating. I'm afraid we'll have to make way for those damned pencil crushing people. Thank you again very much. Good night.

Part of that story was written using my incoherent twaddle generation method. If you want to know how it works, probably the best thing to do is go and look on the hooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org while you're there, you can buy some books and make a donation or subscribe and read. God knows how many thousands if not millions of words. Anyway, somewhere on there quite recently, I've got an item about the incoherent talk regeneration method. If you want to know how it's done, here's a shorter little shorter piece taken from a Just a longer piece. This is another sort of lecture by a professor the glands of the investing tissues creat line and deposited always submerged. These arrests the spat at the moment of admission.

While we were away, I've been away for two weeks, as you probably know, and so is any live recordings at resonance. And I think it was while I was away the BB C's new little set of three Sherlock dramas came to a close and the critics have had their say. All I want to really say about it is that it yet again missed an opportunity. I never understand why writers feel that they need to come up with entirely new stories. When Conan Doyle or rather his narrator Dr. Watson left so many tantalizing glimpses of cases he never got around to recording in full within the canon of the Sherlock Holmes stories, for example, Watson, at one point or another, mentioned cases that he's never written up into stories. For example, Vaughn, Bishop of Frankfort, Mason of Bradford, the notorious moolah, Lefevre and literary a of Montpellier, a Samson of New Orleans, Van Johnson of Utrecht, the Ratcliffe highway murders, dulsky of Odessa, the wills in Riga in 1857 and St. Louis in 1871. Mrs. sessile foresters domestic complication, the woman who poisoned three children for their insurance money, similar cases in India and senegambia, the bishop's gate jewels, the trap of murder, the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, the mission for the Dutch royal family, the Darlington substitution scandal, that business at arms worth castle, the dumb data separation case, the intricate matter in mass say, the disappearance of Mr. Etheridge the similar cases in Andover and the Hague. The Adventure of the parador chamber, the amateur mendicant society, the loss of the bark Sophie Anderson, the greiss Patterson's on offer the Camberwell poisoning the tank Avila clubs scandal, two murders for throwing vitriol, suicide and a number of robberies associated with the blue car bundle. This is Ferran Tosh and the Opel tiara the madness of Colonel Warburton, the Grosvenor square furniture van, the king of Scandinavia and similar cases in Aberdeen and Munich, the affair of the bogus laundry, the tahltan murders, Van bury the wine merchant, the old Russian woman, the singular affair of the elementium crotch, the club footed Rika Letty and his abominable wife. Baron mo purchase and the Netherlands Sumatra company that Worthington bank robbery, Adams and the manor house the tired captain, the French government casing, Nene and our bond, the Scandinavian royal family, the Vatican cameos Wilson of the district messenger office, the grodno blackmail and others little Russia. The Anderson murders in North Carolina, the kernel upward card scandal at the non perrey Club. Matta mon Ponzi a murder charge against a daughter, the Mozi mystery Morgan the poisoner Mary drew of abominable memory. Matthews, who knocked out Holmes's left canine in the waiting room at Charing Cross. The murder of Mrs. Stewart in law order. The papers of ex president Murillo the Dutch steamship Friedland, Bert Stevens the murderer, the persecution of tobacco millionaire john Vincent harden. Archie Stanford, the forger. The Pharaohs documents, the Abergavenny murder, the death of Cardinal Tosca Wilson, the canary trainer, the dreadful business of the Abernathy family, the conch singles and forgery, Crosby, the banker and the red leech the contents of the adult and barrel, the Smith Mortimer succession case.

Finally, this week, I want to address an important question about Samuel Johnson, Dr. Johnson. But before I do that, I would like to point out one thing that I learned today, which is that when a bishop is on his deathbed, by law, he has to leave in his will his pack of dogs to the reigning monarch of the reigning monarch, to use freely. So if there are any elderly or ill bishops listening, make sure that when you finally make it to your deathbed, you remember to leave your pack of dogs to the queen. Now, the question I want to ask, the important question I want to ask about Dr. Johnson is how many ducks died under his in ungainly boot when he was an infant? According to Boswell, quote, it is told that when a child of three years old, he chose to tread upon a duckling, the 11th of a brood and killed it, upon which he said he dictated to his mother, the following epitaph. Here lies good master duck, whom Samuel Johnson trod on, if it had lived. It had been good luck. But then we've had an odd one. Boswell tells the story, excuse me, only to deny that it ever happened. The anecdote of the duck, he writes, has been disproved by internal and external evidence and the truth of which I am to refute upon Dr. Johnson's own authority. So it seems he's only got Johnson's work. for it, but is he denying that his hero trod on a duck? Or only that having done so, the precocious tiny extemporize the verse about the deed. Be that as it may, Boswell seems to have misunderstood the original story. His source was Anna Seward, who heard it repeatedly, it seems from Johnson's stepdaughter, Lucy Porter, who in turn got it from Johnson's mother. In this version, the three year old Johnson, quote, made some verses on having killed by treading on it his 11th dark, unquote. We can construe this as suggesting that the future lexicographer had already stamped upon 10 ducks before memorializing the 11th inverse. Do we believe Boswell or Anna Seward? in extraordinary people 1965 has to give Pierson notes that Boswell has given the impression studiously adopted by other Johnsonian that Anna Seward is not to be trusted, but she is quite as reliable as Boswell sober and more reliable than Boswell drunk. And a Seward 1742 to 1809 was a poet admired by, among others. So Walter Scott, who after her death, and it did three volumes of her work, or while he confided to a friend that most of it is absolutely execrable. Her journal and letters confirm her as one of the great purple prose writers there's ever been. If she wanted to tell you there were very few woodcocks to be seen, she would write the trans my Gregory Gentry of dusky pinyon, a great strangers here. She also wrote to the dying days of an acquaintance, the intellectual torch wavered, not neither dimmed in it earthly socket. Well, I hope my earthly socket is remains undimmed next week, and yours too. I'll be back then with more stuff. So thank you for listening and goodbye.
