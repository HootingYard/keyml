Good evening This is hooting out on the air with me, Frank key. For the last couple of weeks we've been proceeding through the alphabet. And we're going to continue proceeding through the alphabet this week. And last week show ended with or for oza. Mandy. Yes. So this week we begin with P and P is for piffle. Some people do spout the most extraordinary piffle present company excepted. And I suppose we should expect the words of politicians to be particularly piffle strewn. But last week in The Guardian, I think three or four days after Ed Miliband had been elected, the new leader of the Labour Party appeared this. This line appeared in a report in The Guardian. One of his Shadow Cabinet allies insisted Ed Miliband was growing in stature as a leader by the hour. by the hour, he'd become the Labour Party leader on the Saturday afternoon that was written on the Tuesday. And if we grant that to get elected in the first place, he must already have demonstrated just a teensiest smidgen of leadership quality, what on earth must he be like by now? And what will it be like in a week and a month time? Assuming the next general election takes place in 2015 and Ed Miliband stature continues to grow by the hour, he will have become a mighty potentate, a modern oza man DS, King of kings. But we'll move swiftly on from that topical topical item to cue. Few experiences are as alarming as sinking up to your waist in a quagmire. Having blundered into a quagmire because you were not looking where you were going. Your immediate reaction will probably be to shout your head off, calling for help and to flail your arms in a haphazard manner, hoping perhaps to summon rescue by visual as well as auditory means. Unfortunately, it so happens that the overwhelming majority of quagmires to be found in rustic settings with low population density, rather than in the Hurly burly of our crowded cities, where you could confidently expect at least one pass or buy in the teeming urban throng to notice your pickle and daftar your assistance, perhaps with a winch, out in the countryside. depending upon how remote from human habitation it is, hours or days, or even weeks might elapse before some wayfarer comes striding past the quagmire to witness your plight. That is not to say that urban quagmires do not exist, but they tend to be spiritual ones, cogs of moral turpitude, and they need not concern us here. It was shortly after dawn that you sank into your quagmire bleary eyed on a morning hike, you at least know that you have many hours of light ahead, and this knowledge should help you to keep your pecker up. After all, statistically, the longer the daylight, the more chance there is of a peasant passing by. Now, I haven't studied statistics and of course, there are all sorts of variables to take into account. But I think I can safely say that you have more reason for optimism. If you have sank into a quagmire early in the morning, rather than at dusk. As the sun sinks in the West and the sky turns black. You can adjust the intensity of your hope or hopelessness based on what o clock it is when you sink for of course, it may be neither dawn or dusk but 230 in the afternoon or one minute past midnight. If the latter, should you survive your deal, you would be well advised to review your decision to go marching about the bleak countryside in the middle of the night and resolve not to do so in future if it cannot all be avoided.

For the purposes of our blathering, let's assume it's mid morning and summer. And that's many hours of daylight to lie ahead. You have spent I would guess about 10 minutes bellowing and waving to no avail before you apprehend the futility of doing so. The effort Do you have expand expended has served to exhaust you. You are tempted to weep around you, the countryside is still and silent, save for a breeze rustling the leaves of the trees, the cure up and tweet and cough and boom of birds, the scurrying in the undergrowth of busy moles and other habituate of field and modern Duff, for the countryside is never truly still not truly silent. And the poem, I have not yet mentioned that one of the salient features of the average quagmire is that foul, mythic fumes rise from it, you would naturally want to cover your nose with the embroidered linen handkerchief you keep in your trouser pocket. But of course, both pocket and handkerchief and in the trousers are submerged in the quagmire, you have no choice but to snap up the noid some stench after an hour or so you will get used to it. So there's another reason to look on the bright side. Excuse me. Another thing I have not mentioned is the possibility that stricken with panic, you may have struggled to kick your legs down there in the filthy Gloop. This is a very bad idea. Indeed, if you do manage to move to a lower limb is about even a tiny bit. The resulting dislodgement of some of the sludge may make you sink further. It's bad enough having sunk up to your waist. Imagine how much more alarming it would be if you plunged in further up to your neck. Actually, don't imagine that because it will make you terrified and it's absolutely critical that you keep your wits about you. A person in a quagmire is still a person. It's a great pity that only in fairy stories do we find talking animals. As the day passes, any number of creatures may come to gaze upon you. Their curiosity stirred their tiny, stupid brains wondering if you might be food squirrels, reindeer Pathfinders or from above vultures to give just four examples. Would that one of them could comprehend humans speech and relay a message on your behalf. Some beasts are more intelligent than others, such as dolphins and pigs and crows, but even they cannot speak the Queen Queen's English. You can at least take comfort that none of the animals that come to look at you is prepared to scamper or creep or crawl or sliver or slink across the quagmire. They're to devour you flesh and bone. From time to time, especially as the evening draws on. It's a good idea to resume your shouting and gesticulating just in case a countryside person happens to be passing on foot or by bicycle or a Strider horse pulling a cart. But what if nobody comes? What if nobody comes? One thing we can be sure of is that the sun will set the sky will turn black mariadb stars will twinkle upon you in your quagmire

ah is four r r is the single letter pseudonym of the indefatigable anagram artist who often comments on the hooting yard blog on the website go to go to a post to draw on the website and you may find that our has upended an interesting anagram Anyway, when our appeared on the website are the indefatigable anagram artist commented that he had been too preoccupied baiting Dalmatian after images with a steam fitting malaria bandage and was unable to say anything further. Talking of anagram artists are could also have been for royal and a grammar test because Louie either Louie the 14th or Louie the 16th of France. I can't remember which One, perhaps both actually employed a royal anagram artist to devise anagrams of various various things that came to pass the court of the king. Because they were thought to be significant. Significant begins with s s also is for saints. Well, just one st. Actually. St bibley bib debe. The church dedicated home stands in partial ruin in sunlight. That is forever dappled, as was St. Beverly babe himself, usually by all accounts. It may have been Gerard Manley Hopkins was thinking of St. bibley. big dip when he wrote, Glory be to God for dappled things in pied beauty, though in praising, quote, all things counter original, spare, strange, unquote. The Jesuit poet does not actually mention the saint by name, or indeed by inference. And it may be that I'm just indulging in wishful thinking. It wouldn't be the first time

he's dappled them whatever may have caused it is one of the few things we know about St. Beverly babe. As with many though not all saints, his life is more myth than history. And it's arguable that he never existed at all, being rather an amalgam of several shadowy figures obscured by the mists of time, who those figures might be is open to conjecture. One recent hagiography posits the possibility that the st we think of as St. bibley babe, is a combination of over 200 persons of medieval times earlier, who all got cobbled together through an error in the illumination of a Codex in the scriptorium of an abbey perched on the declivity in the foothills of a large and important mountain range during a ferocious 12th century thunderstorm. But just as I prefer to imagine father Hopkins sprawled on the grass among the tombstones of St. bibley. Big Dibs churchyard on a gorgeous springtime afternoon, contemplating the saints and writing his sprung rhythms. So I like to imagine a real corporeal dappled saint roaming medieval fields and Riverside, dressed in some sort of ecclesiastical garb, a battered Halo hovering above his bonds being saintly. What else do we know about him? Not much. His symbolic attributes include a toasting fork, a funerary urn, a Finch and a Robin, half a wolf, a bloody sword, a corrective boot, and a medallion of beaten tin. These are arrayed around him clockwise in alphabetical order in his icons, some of which date as far back as 1937 when he was canonized on the same day, coincidentally as the Hindenburg disaster, that hagiography I mentioned posit something else as it happens, he claims the Hindenburg exploded in gigantic balls of flaming gas, because one of the crew was hurt to curse say the bibley bib as the airship approached lakehurst Naval Air Station for its high landing known as flying more because it would be more to a high moring point, and then winched down to ground level. As we know, there was to be no winching, of an airship on that fateful day. The hagiography provides no evidence for this grave charge, which must cause considerable pain to any living relatives of the cursing crew man, and which it must be said paints saints bibley babe himself as a petulant and vengeful saint flying into a rage at the Marist slight. I'm sure there must be at least a few saints of whom that might be a fitting character sketch, but surely not dear old same bibley bib Deeb. I prefer to think of him dappled with his attributes bestowing his patronage his and scissor. Alas, as far as I've been able to ascertain, St. bibley. Babe, is the patron saint of nothing of nothing, or no one at all.

own words, without pause to the letter T, you know alphabet, T is for Taylor. More precisely, Joseph Taylor, the author of apparitions, or the mystery of ghosts hobgoblins and haunted houses developed, being a collection of entertaining stories, founded on fact, and selected for the purpose of eradicating those fears, which the ignorant the weak and the superstitious are but to act to encourage for one to properly examining into the causes of such absurd impositions, published in 1815, wherein he remarks into allier. And I quote, idiots in general are remarkably fond of anything relative to a funeral procession. It's well worth bearing in mind, I think. And let us move on with the U u 's for unbutton. I have written at length previously about the unbutton that which is not a button, but there is so much more to be said so much more. You would be surprised I think, had you studied the unbuttoned to the extent into the depth I have just how much can be written on the subject. stuffed in a drawer somewhere, I have a stack of notebooks in which a scribbled page off the page of the page of my notes, notes I made diligently during my studies of the unbutton. I'm glad I made the notes for I have a mind like a sieve. And I've actually forgotten most of what I learned. And food unfortunately, I've also forgotten the location of the draw in which the notebooks are stuffed. So I shall have to hunt that down before I can familiarize myself with the material. I say material, as that's a generic term. Because I've never ever been sure whether to refer to my notes as data or law or even in extremists. ravings. It's also unhelpful that my unbuttoned studies and thus my note taking took place at a time when I was under the spell the considerable spell of the note taking and handwriting guru Jim pock. In addition to his grand pronouncements upon note taking and handwriting, Jim Pok was given to insisting his countenance growing more florid by the second upon certain idiosyncratic spellings, of which guru spelled g Oh, you are Oh, you with inserted O's was one. Actually, I can't think of any others. What I do recall so vividly that my heart almost birth is his screeching command. He called it a use case, as if he were Azhar to have no truck with legibility. In his world, legibility was a crime. He never explained why this was so swatting the queries of His devotees aside like flies. He did not actually refer to his method as speed scribbling, but that's a pretty good description of what he taught from his podium with his gesticulations. What it means is that all those thousands of notebooks I filled while studying the unbuttoned are unreadable, even if I could find the draw in which I stuffed them. When I abandoned my unbuttoned studies around the time of the Tet offensive. Jim Pok himself knew nothing about the unbutton. In fact, every time I let slip my field of studies he became rattled. Once I was even expelled from the yeard, until I promised to refrain from raising the subject. For all his vision revision rinas Jim Pok was stuck in the mundane world of buttons, solid and comprehensible and utilitarian, he could not or would not see that striving, however blindly towards an apprehension of the unbuttoned could lead us into realms and dreamed of had we bought the courage to sniff out the clues like hogs in search of truffles. Looking back, it's all too clear to me that I took a wrong turn at the beginning of the Vietnamese Year of the Monkey, Tet mouse fan, mentally at least I can sign the unbuttoned to an unscratched paper and pointed my brain towards less abstruse matters only now over 40 years later, as the unbuttoned come back to haunt me like the familiar in this Story by Jay Sheridan le fanu.

Jim Park would be rolling in his grave if he had one. But as far as I know, he did not die. Rather, he was transfigured somehow onto a higher or lopsided plane from where I dare say he still issues you cases on illegibility and other matters of questionable import from his a serial podium with his Phantom gesticulations.

V is for Lincoln sport surely one of the most foolish and tedious sports ever devised, I make no apologies for lifting the following description directly from the Wikipedia with minor tampering zand omissions. thinkin sport Dutch for Finnish sport is a competitive animal sport in which male calf injuries are made to compete for the highest number of birdcalls in an hour, also called vidkun. zitting Dutch for things sitting. It is primarily active in the Dutch speaking Flanders region of Belgium. thinkin sport traces its origins to competitions held by Flemish merchants in 1596 and is considered part of traditional Flemish culture. As of 2007, it's estimated that there were over 13,000 enthusiasts called Vin Kenny is breeding 10,000 birds every year. animal rights activists have opposed the sport for much of its history. In a contest, a row of small cages each housing a single male Finch is lined up approximately six feet apart along the street. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their call, most often transcribed those Sisk a wheat. A tally mark in Cork is made on a long wooden stick. The birds singing it song The most times during one hour wins the contest. The earliest known records of Lincoln ears are from 1596. By the late 19th century vincom the settings popularity had diminished significantly, but it's all a resurgence after the First World War. Thinking ears use a variety of methods to increase the number of calls in their birds. techniques to develop singing aptitude include selective breeding programs, high protein diets, and stimulating them with music and recordings of birdsong. As wild finches generally begin singing during the spring mating season. keepers may also use artificial lights placed in aviaries to encourage increased song. Something can is claimed that finches from the different regions of Belgium sing in different dialect with birds from Flanders, singing in Dutch, and those from Wallonia singing undesirably in French. While minute regional differences in song have been observed in the chaffinch, though not within Belgium, the differences have only been reliably distinguishable by the use of sonograms. taxonomically there are no officially recognized subspecies of chaffinch within Belgium. As with other sports, vincom sport has had its cheating scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One thing sang a record 1278 siskey wheat in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang the exact same number of calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within there's further material in the original article on the Wikipedia about various cruelties practiced by Lincoln ears, which you can go and read if you wish. I haven't included it here because I know deep in my heart that there is not a single hooting yard listener who would ever countenance cruelty to our avian powers, and I do not wish to nauseate you. If you're thinking of taking up competitive Lincoln sport, might I suggest that you may need to be incarcerated in a Mercy Home for those plagued by criminal insanity directed Towards birds.

If I read the next piece very quickly, we might be able to get through it before the end of the show. On the other hand, it would be better if I read it at a steady pace. So maybe we'll leave w for next week. Which leaves us with with a kind of gap at the end of the show but typical of hooting yard to leave these things and unexplored and only original website are in addition to being for our the indefatigable anagram artist was also for remembering Marie A, which is a song by Bertolt Brecht and I linked to a YouTube video of David Bowie singing, remembering the array in the 1982 TV production of bow, the breath play from which it comes. So you can go and have a look at that. What else, go to visit the hooting yard website. If you want to see that, while you're there, you can buy some books. You could make a donation, you could even take out a regular subscription. Every little every penny helps. And those of you who don't realize this resonance, apart from having three, paid or not paid very much paid staff is all of the program makers and all of the engineers are volunteers unpaid. So you looked at the resonance by going to the resonance website. And again, every every few quid helps, but we do appreciate any donations that come in either to myself at hooting yard for the hooting yard fund for distressed out of print pamphleteers or resonance on helpful bit of money you might and might as it for this week, I think we will continue in fact, we'll probably get to the end of the alphabet next week. Beginning with w going through Zed, and then I might treat you to some exciting quotations from operating printouts and secret societies of modern London, written by Elliot O'Donnell. The modern London in question is the modern London of when the book was published, which was way back in 1934. Right, I'll be back next week. Hope you've enjoyed listening. Bye bye
