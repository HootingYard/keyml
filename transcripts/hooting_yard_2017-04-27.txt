Hi there, this is this this is the seafaring seafaring resonance FM I can hear goals I can definitely have goals, skewers and guillemots. Yes, Shiver me timbers This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Katelyn Frank key. And this is HMS hooting yard on air. Actually, no, no kidding here. I have been asked to name a trawler. This is part of my ongoing campaign of global Dominion I've done that I've had a film made of one of my stories have involved got involved with some artists in Amsterdam. And over the years, and now, I've been asked to name the past of a synthesizer, which has been done. And yeah, the lightest, someone's asked me the nightmare crawler. So I have provided some suggestions. And when he has selected the crawler name, I'll let you know what it is. So let's get on with the show, shall we? May hearties. I don't know what all this is about. We're actually completely land bound. Live from Barra High Street in London. I'm very much looking forward to the new 26 part television drama, The stealthy camp, which begins next week. previews have not been available, but a few details have been leaked to the press. Very few actually, the title, the number of episodes, and the basic premise. I've told you the first two, so let me now move on wings on the fold to the third. The stealthy camp centers around a camp who is stealthy. Each week that camp tries to use his talent for stealthiness in some way, for example, creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark or lurking next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare or taking part in a jewel heist. But as the series title indicates, while he is in goober doubly stealthy, he is also Trump being a Trump each week, he manages to sabotage his own stealthiness by making the sort of idiotic decision only a dyed in the wool chump would make. So when creeping unsane through a cemetery after dark, he carries with him a box of fireworks which through cack handedness with a box of matches he manages to ignite all at once, thus drawing attention to himself with lots of sparkly whizzes and bangs. When working next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare. He wears a hat with a giant propeller on it, and the wind picks up and spins the propeller blades around them the stealthy Trump finds himself hovering a few feet off the ground, making passes by golf. When taking part in a jewel heist, he carries a box of fireworks and wears his propeller hat at the same time with predictable results. I hope I haven't given the impression that the stealthy Trump is a comedy. On the contrary, by all accounts, it's the sort of drama invariably described as gritty. What this means is that it's set in the north of England, where the rainfall is incessant. several characters scowl and swear a lot and nobody ever smiles, not even the stealthy camp himself. I suggested above that the title character was dyed in the wool and this is literally the case. Each week. The stealth camp was an item of knitwear. And the dye that has been used to cover the wall has also colored the stealthy camp from head to toe. As all his knitwear is dyed in brash and gaudy blues and pinks and yellows. The fact that his head is the same color means he finds it even more more difficult to be in conspicuous and stealthy, and is thus even more of a Trump.

The selfie camp was filmed entirely on location in a municipal carpark. No animals were harmed in the making of the series, except for some ants and beetles and other creepy crawlies and an unfortunate trumpeter Swan that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

A quick reminder to any new listeners out there that you might want to go to a voting yard website roofing yard.org where you can find millions of words hundreds of pictures and have the opportunity to buy several paperback books and one ebook and one hardback book all by me so I think you should do that and I recommend that you you buy the books and then you have something to curl up with by the fire side on the long autumn evenings and this show is being recorded well live in April so I thought your wife talked about the long autumn evenings but you know if they you know you can you can curl up by the by the fire by the unlit fire side on the long summer evenings. hosing yard.org is the website for all your hooting yard needs? Say goodbye to non hooting yard misery and all those kind of things anyway, in the autumn of his he is Dobson received a letter asking him to contribute to a symposium. Such invitations were rare for the out of print pamphleteer. And he became unreasonably overexcited, unable to think clearly. He walked down his breakfast and went for a brisk walk along the towpath of the filthy old canal shouting and chucking pebbles at swans. When he arrived home sopping wet from the torrential downpour. He read the letter. Apparently, what the sender called his unique insight would be welcomed for a symposium on the importance of the cummerbund as a new romantic signifier with particular reference to Spandau Ballet. Dobson had questions, but unfortunately his enamorado marigolds to who he felt sure would know about these things, was off on a week long gala event. The pamphleteer had a vague idea what a cummerbund was. But that was about all of the symposium titled he understood. He knew a bit about the romantics, but what was a new romantic? What exactly was meant by a signifier, and most baffling and befuddling of all? Was there really a ballet troupe resident Spandau Prison in Berlin? And if not, what on earth did the two words thus conjoined refer to? These were his questions. As he poured over the invitation, Dobson felt his excitement bubbling up again. He could barely recall when last he had been invited to anything lesser known, let alone an important symposium, leaving the unanswered questions to waft in the midst of fuddle he dashed off a letter of acceptance, not forgetting to ask his bus fare be paid and a cup of tea provided. Then he crashed back out into the rain to buy a stamp at the post office and to plop his reply into a letterbox. On his way home along one of the less salubrious boulevards of pointy town, it occurred to Dobson that the answers to his questions could conceivably be common knowledge among the riffraff, it would not be the first time he discovered that things of which he was wholly ignorant, were known by the most wretched and unsightly specimens of the lower orders. A gruesome little twerp, for example, had once vouchsafed to the pamphleteer not only the names of the four Liverpudlian mob tops, but also told him which one wore spectacles and was married to an avant garde Japanese performance artist. This information had proved invalid When Dobson came to write his pamphlet, several anagrams of oo nookie informed by my unique insight into popular culture out of print. So it was the pamphlet here buttonholed a number of hoi polloi in the street, shouting at them about romanticism and signifiers and ballet in German prisons. But by now, the torrential rain had grown rainy and more torrential. And all those who's helped Dobson sort swept past him, pausing only to curse will spit or kick. When eventually he made it home. He was none the wiser.

Dobson satta is s Gregoire of ours pencil poised over a blank sheet of paper. He was at a loss. Then he had a brainwave, he would go to the symposium and extemporize so long as he included the key word repeatedly in whatever he said, he felt sure he could carry it off. had not Laurence Olivier done the same when performing Shakespeare, babbling nonsense occasionally, just to amuse himself and to disconcert the rest of the cast. And after all, this was an academic symposium, where nothing anybody said would make the slightest bit of sense anyway. Dobson tossed his pencil aside, and went to slump in an armchair, gazing out of the window that crows in the rain. The day before the symposium a further letter arrived from the organizers, dear Dobson it read, I'm afraid we're unable to pay your bus fare and cannot provide you with a cup of tea. We are therefore withdrawing or invitation, Toodle Pip. In the spring and summer of his years, a younger Dobson would have parlayed this crushing disappointment into a pamphlet of sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. Now, he merely slumped to his escrito, moaning and weeping for days on end, until marigold came home.

Frank Key  12:52
The vast majority of Dobson's pamphlets were self published printed on a stettler machine in the garden shed by marigold to the bindings stitched by hand. On one occasion, however, the pamphleteer felt impelled to seek commercial publication. I feel impelled, he announced to marigold to over a breakfast of tippetts brats and marzipan brew lay one desolate winter's morning, I feel impelled to seek commercial publication for one of my pamphlets Mary gold to raise an eyebrow. I shall be most distraught, or is the word distrait. She replied, to leave the good stettner idle while you go swatting off to large important buildings, but I nevertheless think it a good idea or be it foolish, and I wish you well. 20 minutes later, Dobson went crashing out of the door into the winter, Horace vowing not to return until he had persuaded a publishing concern based in a large important building to issue one of his pamphlets in an addition of millions. His first port of call was semi collapsed house, a large important and semi collapsed edifice on slobber line, just along from the railway sidings and the hamster pound. It's lower floors, how's the offices of serene lantana Noland buke, an ancient and distinguished publishing company best not to dwell on the doings of the buildings upper floors, which had been rented out for many years to babinski the lumbering walrus mustache serial killer icicles dangling from the brim of his Homburg Dobson crashed into the reception area. It was deserted, safe for a strike cobweb scurrying beetle. Dobson stamped on the beetle and the father of his Cambodian actuaries boots upon them linoleum and the beetle brought up humblebee hoys skittering into the room from a dark interior somewhere or rather, the Hubble de hoy target is forelock which was greasy, greasy and vile, greasy and vile and repellent. How may I be of assistance good sir, he whimpered. I am. Dobson shouted Dobson, as if that were all the world need no. Several hours later having managed to persuade the Hubble de hoy to allow him beyond the reception area, the pamphleteer was ushered into the office of Mr. Serra Montana norm, or possibly Mr. bude. I understand, said the publisher that you have been impelled to seek commercial publication for one of your pamphlets. To whom am I shouting, shouting Dobson. The hobble the hallway loomed behind him and spoke barely audible words into his ear. This is Mr. Bewkes. He is boisterous and brilliant and barbaric. You can tell them apart when they both occupy the same space because Mr. Serra lantana lawn is satin Island scruffy and Savage. No sooner had he stopped speaking, the satin Island, scruffy and savage fellow slid into view from behind an heiress See, said the hobo Leroy we might usefully pause here to consider a potted history of Syrah Montana, non Dubuque, it has a history not only potted but illustrious, redolent with terrific books and equally terrific authors with terrific mezzotints tinted especially for the covers of those terrific books, and with terrific hairstyles sported by those terrific offers. Unfortunately, from somewhere upstairs, that comes the ungodly dean of babinski reeking his usual blood splattered chaos. It is a den which deferens as it distracts, so should we shall have to postpone the potted history for a more opportune time. I have penciled in next Tuesday lunchtime, incorrigible optimist that I am. Instead, let us watch as winter sunlight grifters on the semi collapsed roof of semi collapse house. Let us ponder its broken chimney pots in which adventurous birds have built their nests in which tattered mammalian fledglings screech their beaks opened wide are waiting mama or Papa to come swooping in from foraging to drop juicy, wounded worms into their gullets Let's watch his clouds scattered across the winter sun and the first flurries

of snow begin to fall. And now below, we see the pamphleteer injected into the street. Dobson has left the building Hello. Dobson said marigold to later as a snow covered in ammirato came crashing through the door. How did you get on? It was like this marigold my puppet said Dobson. I visited the offices of Suriname Tannen on and bukh the ancient and distinguished publishers, where I met satin Island scruffy and savage Nutter woods, Sarah Nan Tannen, and boisterous and brilliant and barbaric be buke. Also, there hubballi hoy, who acts as a kind of factotum and after some surely shouting into the details of which I shall not go now or ever more, for it pained me exceedingly, and I do not wish to relive it. The humblebee who I made a pot of tea for three, and we sat in armchairs, the publishers and me and Bute began to speak, but I could not hear a word he said, For form from above. On the upper floors of the building, came Sandra Dean, as can only have been the sound of a psychopathic serial killer committing an enormity, perhaps with an axe, and when eventually subsided after a final blood curdling scream, I asked buke to repeat himself, but instead his colleagues spoke and there was savagery in his voice, as he explained that the previously independent publishing firm founded by Sarah Nunn, Tana nons, grandfather and grandmother, so long ago have now through what he called market forces, or whatever they might be, had been sold to a new owner of untold wealth and influence. And this fellow generously allowed Suriname Tannen and buke to cling on to their positions in the offices in semi collapsed house, but that all decisions about what was published or not published. Were his the new owners and his alone and if I told them Something about my proposed pamphlet, then they would ferry he used the word ferry that to the owner, and he would consider my proposal there and then they like to make snap decisions. So I said that I had an idea for a pamphlet about a revolutionary new type of bird seed or millet. But if that was not deemed commercial enough, I also had up my sleeve and exciting science fiction yarn entitled Attack of the jellyfish monsters from Planet googie. withers. And would they run both of those paths the new owner and bunion Sara lantana non looked at one another, and gulped down their cups of tea in somewhat barbaric and savage fashion, as if they had never drunk out of dainty China cups before. And then they told me to wait. And they both left the room. And I sat and peered out the window, and saw that snow was falling, and I fell into a daze and dreamed of dust. And I woke when the door opened, and it was neither Sarah montanan on nor bukh, but the Hubble de hoy, and it gave me a wolfish grin, and took my empty cup and smashed it against the wall, like Dusty Springfield like to do with crockery. And then, there was a puff of smoke and the hobbyhorse vanished and a cloud of fuming vapor, as black as the blackest thing in the universe, and beyond. And a mile and a minute or so later, he stepped out of it towards me, and it was no longer him the hobby horse, but a transfigured version with horns, and a forked tail, and eyes that burned. And it was Beelzebub himself, I swear it assures exit eggs, and he roared at me that he had given due consideration to my suggestions, and made a snap decision that the world was absolutely ready for a million selling pamphlet about a revolutionary new type of bird seed or millet. And he had already had his minions, Sarah Nunn, Tannen on and buke draw up a contract, and he brandish it at me a single sheet of paper on which the word seemed to have been scratched in gore by a wild beast. And he continued to roar, saying, I must understand that by signing the contract, in return for commercial publication of my pamphlet, I will be sending him my immortal soul, and did I understand him quite plainly, by soul would be his for eternity. And did I realize that eternity never came to an end. And if I wanted to comprehend the unimaginable duration of eternity, I will to read the sermon by the priest in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young man by James Joyce,

Frank Key  22:48
Joyce, and I said, I had already read it, and I understood it. And he said, Here is your chance to back out, you can leave semi collapsed house and forget everything that has happened here. And continue with your puny and cuddled life churning out unread an out of print pamphlet, until you drop dead. But if you sign the contract, I will publish your bird seed, fold the roll, and I will have your soul. And I said, All right, all right. You don't need to repeat yourself. I get the idea. And he shoved the contract into my hands and gave me a bio and said, So will you sign Dobson? Will you sign and my heart was going like mad? And yes, I said, Yes, I will. Yes.

Frank Key  24:04
Yeah, so that was a sort of homage to James Joyce. I read when I'm reading things to on the radio. I'm reading them from a tablet. And because my eyesight is so catastrophic. I haven't I have the print, I you know, have the print quite big. So there's not that many. There's only a few. Few. There's several lines on the screen at any one time. And I had no idea I'd forgotten when I wrote that. But of course, it ended with an extremely lengthy single sentence by Dobson and I was quite surprised, but we got through it. We got through it. And I hope you enjoyed it. And here at hooting yard we hate and despise a mill and all his works. Dorothy Parker had it right. Sorry, Doris Parker had it right when in her constant reader column in the New Yorker, she wrote, and this is that word hummy my darlings that marks the first place in the house at Pooh corner at which constant wieder flowed up. Nevertheless, I'm delighted to learn that the poo part of the name Winnie the Pooh, was originally attached to a swarm poo being the name. Milan's son Christopher Robin gave to a swarm he befriended in angmering in Suffolk. If I did not have more important things to do with my time, I might go through the entire awful Canon and rewrite the stories making Winnie the Pooh, a savage and violence one instead of an allegedly cute bear. Volume One, Winnie the Pooh attacks Tim Henman and breaks his arm.

Finally, this week, like a saint in a medieval painting, Captain nitti bought an attribute. St. Clement, for example is usually shown with an anchor, St. JOHN chrysostom. With B's st Dunstan with a hammer and tongs and st vest with a wolf carrying a goose in its mouth. Captain nitti was often to be seen with a handful of breadcrumbs. There are several photographs of Captain nitti taken by the pointy town High Street snapper Fx duggleby in all, but one of which is attribute or emblem is present and correct. Captain nifty holdout is open palm piled with breadcrumbs as if proffering them to the viewer. The exception is the picture of Captain nitti. Pretending to fly. He is wearing a pair of wings made out of corrugated cardboard, satin and Tat, gazing into the middle distance with a look of startling stupidity. The change with which is attached to the ceiling of duggleby Studio A clearly visible despite the photographer's efforts to bleach them out with bleach. There are two different stories given as the origin of Captain This is traditional of association with a handful of breadcrumbs. The first is that our hero was regularly sent on maneuvers to a new MIT to a municipal Park, where insurgent bent on toppling the regime was said to use the flower beds with their dazzling splurges of lupins and hollyhocks as places of concealment. And then the flower bed was a pond in which teal mergansers pigtails and swans were rife, soft hearted, and by some accounts, soft brained, Captain nitti like to feed the ducks and swans by scattering breadcrumbs upon the surface of the waters. After the regime was toppled, he took much of the blame distracted by ducks in the words of the official chargesheet. Unlike a saint in a medieval painting, Captain that he was not martyred unless one considers a sentence of several months potato peeling, duty, and martyrdom. The other story is vastly more complicated and impossible the summarize. readers would do better to study the seven volume novel sequence game of breadcrumbs, making notes all the while in the margins. Those of you without the patience or ability to read can instead watch the television adaptation, which is what a mental piece is worth rewards, including the silver bobble for best Swan and the FX duggleby Memorial pot for most innovative use of bleak and that my friends is the end of this week coating yard. So I hope you've enjoyed it. Most of all of the pieces of mentioned swans as promised last week, and will probably continue in the same vein next week. I wouldn't be surprised by which time it will be my bye bye
