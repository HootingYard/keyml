It's resonance 104 point four FM. It's Thursday. It's six o'clock. It must be hooting out on the air. And you know what it is. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for the next half an hour, even though I've got a little sign in front of me. Which says, Do not wear at the bottom of it says do not read on air. So, that seems to pay to my shop. I'm not sure what I can do. I'm going to ignore this. Notice. Although it does strike me that that may only refer to the information contained above, above the do not read on air, but maybe it does mean do not read on air. Maybe there's a new policy got enough experiment. procure a wide mouth bottle, an egg, a glass tube about three inches long and a quarter inch in diameter, a candle and a piece of wire a little longer than the tube. Remove a part of the shell from the large end of the egg without breaking the skin beneath. This is easily done by gently tapping the shell with the handle of a pocket knife until it is full of small cracks. And then with the blade of the knife, picking off the small pieces. In this way, remove the shell from the space about the size of a nickel. Remove the shell from the small end of the egg over a space about as large as the end of the glass tube. Next, from the lower end of the candle, cut a piece about one half inch long bore a hole in this just the size of the glass tube. Now softly one end of the piece of candle with the hole in it and stick it onto the small end of the egg so that the hole in the candle comes over the hole in the egg. Heat the wire and with it sold with a piece of candle more firmly to the egg making a watertight joint. Place the glass tube in the hole in the piece of candle pushing it down till it touches the egg. Then with the heated wire sold with the tube firmly in place. Now run the wire down the tube and break the skin of the egg just under the end of the tube. fill the bottle with water till it overflows and set the egg on the bottom, the large end in contact with the water. In an hour or so the contents of the egg will be seen rising in the glass tube. And that experiment is from the first book of farming by Charles L. Goodrich. I have absolutely no idea what that's got to do with farming. But I suppose it's something a farmer can do with any spare eggs and candles and wire and glass cube and bottles.

Having said that Dobson the out of print pamphleteer bestrode the 20th century like a Colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself when still a young man. At the age of 20. He published a pamphlet, resoundingly entitled, why I show big strides this century like a Colossus. It is a curious work out of print, of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper Swan on the cover. It begins That I shall be strides this century like a Colossus My name will ring out like a clarion in years to come. Whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers there will be but one name on their lips Dobson.

Such self belief in so callow a youth is touching, looking back in his dotage Dobson found it touching too, and he took to sitting with his one remaining copy of the pamphlet, clutched his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end. When marigold two found him last, she flung open the windows, whatever the weather and stamped around the room, singing loud, coolest sea shanties, ones that involve pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sail, cloth and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson's self pitying lassitude would be broken, and he would fling the curiously pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe away his tears, Don his Bolivian military boots and his Stalinist cardigan and crashed out of the house to go on one of his drums. Dobson is Jones in the latter part of his life usually took him to the nearest pigsty. But there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far, that that day that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other devised by Yoko Ono. Postal delivery persons in the city were required by law to learn all the double street names by heart or to face summary dismissal if they failed. Often, those who did fail, and there were many, many would flounder around on the outskirts of the city, warning travelers away. It was a paltry sort of revenge and seldom succeeded. For the delight to have that shining city on a hill attracted wayfarers from near and far daily in their thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before this particular Tuesday. A dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he was about to cross a bridge that would take him to the most boisterous out quarter of the city. go no further old man. sides of the vengeful postman, whose yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was the last red black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness. But these luxuriance is only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same color as the Don white sockets in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and a striped black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression, and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. This such a your approach is no place for out of print pamphleteers ever sensitive to messages from spooks, and Wraith Dobson turned around and went home. He found a marigold crew in the back garden drilling holes in an enormous sheet of corrugated cardboard. I was walking away from a shining city on a hill he said he said a city you have visited marigold deer marigold to stop drilling, reset the safety catch and removed her protective goggles. You are a foolish old man in your dotage Dobson. She said though there was a there was kindness in her voice.

Excuse me. And that is well you were warned the way for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill is it sits atop is hollow and contained within it. And some say hell. Either way, I'm pleased to see you home better. It's clear the nettles from the vegetable pack. That was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century did Dobson Indeed, the strided as a Colossus, he was not the only person to think so, but the name is of the others who said it escaped me for the time being. When I remember them, I will tell you

the description of the vengeful ex postman in that pace was identical to the description of Frankenstein's monster in Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. The weather was foul on that day in the ancient world, that first day when an unaccompanied horse entered Canada to a hold of the Bank of a mighty waterway. The horse was Alexander the Great speed bucephalus sent by the Macedonian hero for a recuperative holiday. The river was the Bosphorus the strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. Alexander was a firm believer in horse holidays, when young bucephalus had been skittish and temperamental, frightened of his own shadow, and Alexander's ministrations had become him. But even as the mature horse he was now There were times when he needed a break from campaigning and battle. Plus it was that Alexander had waved him off to, as he put it, enjoy the mysteriously sultry atmosphere of a few nights by the Bosphorus but it was not nighttime, sultry or otherwise. When bucephalus arrived at his destination, it was de bleak, grey and wretched, and the majestic horse stood still at the river's edge. snorting. Alexander the Great did not expect him back in Macedonia for a week. Remember, this is the ancient world. So such landmarks as buying the Bosphorus as the gab after tower. The palaces of Dolma, bollock, Sera Gan you do your deeds and by all Hey, the remarry and Anatolian fortresses and the Cooley military high school had not yet been built. bucephalus began to trot following the reverse course hoping to find a field where he could have a restful time munching nutritious foliage.

It was late afternoon on that Thursday when the horse decided to rest and planted his hooves in the mud of the edge of the Bosphorus where today one finds the bag as he suspension toll bridge. He noticed churning in the waters of the mighty river and turned his horse head to look more intently. He was astonished to see a tangle of cephalopods thrashing around in the river cephalopod large and small octopuses, squids, cuttlefish and chambered Nautilus is emitting clouds of ink tentacles flailing what what are they doing at river rather than in the dark colder biters of the sea, where they lost? And did this explain their frantic activity. So follow up. cephalopods are probably the most intelligent of invertebrates with huge pulsating brains. And it's easy to imagine that the realization of being lost in the Bosphorus could induce panic among them. bucephalus are devoted his life to the service of Alexander the Great, but now he wondered how he might help these strange sea creatures, so much more ancient than he or Alexander or even the ancient world in which he lived. Could he somehow take them all back to the sea and release them into the vast pitiless oceans that were their natural home from the warm water the tropics to the icy chill of the poles. Being a horse bucephalus could not think how he might lay a trail of plankton and krill for the cephalopods to pursue. He got he could not think of anything, any way at all to lead them to the sea. Salt so on the spur of the moment, he decided to gallop back to Macedonia to fetch Alexander the Great, confident that his master would know exactly what to do. Last when he got back to Macedonia, bucephalus was told that Alexander was in the ancient Phrygian capital of gaudium, puzzling out how to undo the Gordian knot so he could become the future king of Asia. So the brave horse charged tirelessly onward, collected Alexander, who had either worked out how to undo the knot, or just had to depart with his sword, depending on whose story you believe and sped with him all the way back to the Bosphorus when I got there, I found no sign of the sunflower pods. If a horse can feel sheepish, bucephalus certainly did. He watched us Alexander dismounted and strode off his armor clanking into the field when a horse had managed his lunch. The Macedonian warlord plucked a plant from the earth and brought it over to the horse. This bucephalus is henbane if he's not only the bane of hens, but of horses to one day when the ancient world has passed away, and the new times are known as medieval, it will be used in the bruise concocted by witches To cause to cause visual hallucinations and the sensation of flight. This I know, Alexander smiled and patted bucephalus affectionately on the main poor, deluded horse, he continued, you saw no cephalopods. You were seeing visions of things that cannot be come versus returned to Macedonia at a canter, and I will give you healthy hate to eat. And as night fell on the sultry, mysterious Bosphorus Alexander the Great and bucephalus began their long journey home. And in the depths of the river, the water stirred a squid slithered through a tiny crack in a riverbed rock. It's black fathomless malevolent eyes, piercing the underwater world Long, long ago, and far in the future, for eternity.

Quote from Eric satty, and the manuscript of Embrey, on this issue, this work is absolutely incomprehensible, even to me, perhaps I wanted to be humorous, that would not surprise me and be pretty much in my manner. And I want to use that as an epigraph to one of my out of print pamphlets, but it stands. Yeah, that stands as pretty much in my mailer, I think. Anyway, those of you who listen to the show regularly, and even those of you who don't they know that regrettably, not often enough, but they you can then re listen to these as podcasts. I know that all the shows now appear on Soundcloud but the UPS mixcloud Thank you, john mixcloud. Always shows appear on mixcloud. But they all there are also podcasts quite well. The difference between the two is I'm not entirely sure. But anyway. And the podcasts we've hosting are don't come out often enough, but they do come out. And I thought it might interest listeners to know how the podcasts are created. Many people think that it's simply a case of taking the archived recording of the show and making it available as an mp3 file or similar would that it was so Simple. The truth is that in order for the original live broadcast to be made podcast double, a number of extremely delicate and complicated operations need to be carried out. And that is why about once a month, I summon that dead of night to the gleaming high tech skyscraper wearing looks. resonance 104 point four FM's podcasting Maestro. The first time I went there, it took me about an hour to find him for the skyscraper is enormous and wholly lacking in informative signage. What signs there are a rather baffling or redundant I do not know why this is so and I've never had the courage to ask. I've learned to accept that the front desk in the lobby is labeled simply the front desk in the lobby, and that the person sitting at the desk, whereas a bag reading the person sitting at the front desk in the lobby. This person has not been authorized to answer any questions whatsoever. So weigh in on this first nighttime visit. I asked Where will I find the podcasting Maestro, I may as well have been shouting into the wind, as indeed I was for the lobby acts as both lobby and experimental wind tunnel. Apparently sound recordings are made of the wind in preparation for one of the podcasting maestro's planned podcast, tentatively titled wind in a wind tunnel. Now I was used to the more homespun atmosphere of the station's main studio, and was somewhat unnerved by the grandiosity of my surroundings. I took a chance, however, walked past the person sitting at the front desk in the lobby, who was immersed in reading a battered copy of Stockhausen servs imperialism by Cornelius Cardew, and I took the lift up, hitting a floor number at random, and scattered off down the corridor, I found myself in there were numerous doors along this corridor, all marked door in curry door. There was also I noticed an overpowering smell of guinea pig, though I saw no guinea pig and haven't seen none of my on my subsequent visits. I pushed open doors at random and peeked into each room, hoping to discover the resonance podcast my stroke, but all I found were bales of fuse wire, discarded yogurt cartons, and toy cross stations bite of plasticine. There was a lobster that took my fancy, but it was high up on a shelf, and I have an aversion to teetering on step ladders.

Frank Key  22:58
I think I checked every room on that floor before getting back into lift and choosing another level again at random. This one was different. It had no corridor, just a vast open plan area, with a sign of course reading a vast open plan area empty except for a small patch of ectoplasm. I said that it took me about an hour wandering the skyscraper to find the podcast my stroke, but in truth he found me. I was stumbling fretfully around what seemed like the umpteenth floor when I heard a loud electronic crackling noise, and then a disembodied voice. podcast Maestro to Frank key podcast Maestro to Frank key floor 96 rectangles zone it called. So that is where I went. The podcast Maestro was sitting at a console from which occasional puffs of vapor jetted up to the ceiling and slowly dispersed. He was wearing a metal hat and taking ravenous bites from a toffee apple. Glad you could make it he said. You'd better put on these mittens, And he tossed a pair of mittens to me. They were woven from a material I was unable to identify. And I worried for a moment that I might suffer an allergic reaction. For in the past week, I have had allergic reactions to mittens woven from unfamiliar materials. On this occasion, however, always well. The podcast my stroke, with a great deal of effort, pulled a big lever on his console to know the apparent purpose. Now he said it's nearly three o'clock in the morning and precisely two minutes past we will begin affecting the transfer of one of your past shows into podcast format. It should take about an hour You will need to return the Flim Flam and steady the rattling. Just watch me, you'll soon get the idea. Do you know what he was right? I did. And by four o'clock, we had a complete recording of hooting yard on the air already for podcasting. Since then, I've been back to the skyscraper regularly whenever I get the summons on my metal Tapping Machine, I would not say that I've become friends with the podcast my style exactly, for there is something formidable about him, emphasized by his metal hat. But we do engage in affable banter as the clock ticks towards 3:02am. After that, of course, we're silent, concentrated, utterly involved in our task. And I hope that the pod people among you, when you listen to each new podcast, are also silent, concentrated and utterly involved. Born away from the doll cares of you will dive into the realms of instructive and sensible prose.

Some quotations to end this week show drains Fullerton Moorhead wrote a book about the United States called land of contrast. And one of the things he wrote was so far as my knowledge goes, the United States stands out as pre eminently the land of contrasts, a land which may be bounded by the aurora borealis, but which has also undeniable acquaintance with the flames of the bottomless pit. And I can Matthews wrote full revelations of professional rock capture, which is a fantastic title for a book, isn't it? Full revelations of professional rock capture. And in it Ike Matthews says the trade is not what it was some years ago, when rat pits were allowed. I think it was one of the worst things they ever did for this country. When the authorities stopped the rat pit for when rat killing was allowed in pit. It was a common thing for a rat catcher to receive an order for 100 rats all to be killed at one time, then the rat catcher would get the rats and wherever he got them from he was reading that district of a nuisance. And I think that's I think that's the end of this week's show. Although, let's see, let's see, we may have Yes, let's have one more quotation. Before we end this from the dweller on the threshold by Robert smite Hitchens. It was a medium height, sin and Salchow with gray whiskers thick gray hair, bushy eyebrows and small pointed on inquiring features, which gave him rather the aspect of a prying bird. His eyes were literal and sparkling his mouth strangely enough, was ecclesiastical. He nearly always wore very bright light colored clothes. Even in winter. He was often to be seen, clad in yellow gray tweed, a yellow silk necktie, and a fawn colored Homburg hat and no human being had ever encountered him in a pair of boots unprotected by Spats. I wonder if that's the same person as the rat catcher. It might have been. Anyway, that's the end of this week's show. I hope you enjoyed it. I should be back next week, God willing, and ready to go again then Bye bye.
