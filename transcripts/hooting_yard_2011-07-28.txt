Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Sorry, I wasn't here last week. But now I'm back. And I'm back with something very topical. Actually. It would have been slightly more topical last week but it's still topical. It's a great pity. I think that when the culture Media and Sport committee resolved to grill were Murdoch's they stopped short at James and Rupert, and did not call Iris. I know she's dead, and was unfortunately Gaga for a while before that, but when it's claimed to leave no stone unturned, then no stone should be Unturned, including the stones atop Iris Murdoch's grave, they ought to have been truly turned and she dug up, and a few bolts of Frankensteinian electricity blasted through her before she was hauled into Portcullis House to sit alongside the media mogul and his nerving some it has rightly been said ad nauseum that the phone hacking scandal is Britain's Watergate. Certainly one thing they share is the sense that the whole seizing mess can be evoked by a simple litany of names. JOHN Dean, Chuck Colson, Jeb Magruder, h r. Bob Haldeman, Kenneth Clawson, Howard hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, just reciting the list takes one back to 1970s, Washington. One may no longer be clear about who was who, but even at the time, as new names entered the frame, the waters were muddied. One thought one had a grasp of the matter. And then all of a sudden the papers are full of references to Richard kleindienst. Who is he? What are his connections? What did he know? And when did he know it? this sort of stuff keeps drooling obsessives happy as a lark. And so it is now Andy Colson, Rebecca Brooks, Neil Wolf Man, Wallace, john Yates, Glen mulcair. And suddenly, we have the previously unheard of dick for doctor to elbowing his way in hoovering up the newsprint to be fitted into the drugstore. This is precisely why an opportunity was lost when it was decided, by whom, when, upon whose advice not to question, Iris Murdoch, as if all we sex and death and good and evil and power, and morality would not enough. I think we have a right to know precisely where mag casement and Mrs. tinkham and Hugo Bell founder and Nisha Fox and hunter keep and Nan Moore and Dora Greenfield and Toby gash and James taper pace, and Patchway the gardener and Bruno and Lisa and miles and Danby and Maureen and will an Adelaide and Diana fit into the whole shenanigans. Only Iris Murdoch can tell us and tell us she must. And the public will expect to see robust transparency and transparent robustness and prosecutions and convictions and tittle tattle and footballers wives and soap stars and page three girls.

I think I got a bit confused towards the end there. But that's hardly surprising given the multiple complexities of the whole hack gate thing. Onto more familiar ground now with some news of Dobson I think said Dobson at breakfast one foul and rain sudden Tuesday morning. It's time we had our own mosh pit. marigold Chu raised an eyebrow Dobson. Do you actually know what a mosh pit is? she asked. Not exactly, replied the 20th century's greatest out of print pamphlet here. But I suspect it would be a good use of that part of the garden overhung By laburnum and Sycamore and large, you know that pactola which hangs leafage so dense that it's forever in shadow, and it's home to brambles and nettles and duckweed. I cannot even remember the last time I sat or stood in it, nor even walked through it, nor can I recall ever seeing you doing so. Oh cherished one. It is unused ground, or no ground or span used on this earth, according to some authorities. Which authorities might they be Dobson asked marigold true. Well, I think there is a maximum to that effect in the maxims of bombastic doggin or I could be thinking of Listerine optrex also a great one for Maxim's I can check later. So let me get this straight, said marigold true marshaling with her fork the last few caraway seeds on her breakfast plate. You intend to dig a pit in a shady Arbor in the garden and debate a mosh pit without any clear understanding without any understanding at all of what a mosh pit is. I shall look it up in a thick and exhaustive reference book said Dobson mad with cornflakes. So you will be going to the mobile library said marigold. True. That is my plan, said the pamphleteer. And he got up from the table and proceeded to Don his andalusi and sewage inspectors boots. Today is Tuesday, said marigold to so the mobile library is in quite a different and a distant baileywick. And you think I'm gonna let that stop me shouted Dobson melodramatically, as he crashed out of the door into the downpour. untold hours later, Dobson came crashing back through the door sopping wet, with a gleam in his eye, and a thin paint smile playing about his lips, as if he were Ronald Coleman shooting a scene for random harvest, Mervyn Leroy 1942. Well, Dobson What news asked marigold true. Dobson took his pipe from his pocket, crammed into it a sub of rotting orchard fruit and conquered pipe tobacco from his other pocket, lit up and puffed and said I had a deal of difficulty finding the thick and exhaustive reference book, I thought. Actually, before that I had a deal of difficulty finding the mobile library itself. There is a new mobile Librarian of wild and untrammeled mean, with an unruly beard, whose grasp of the shedule is weak. He had driven the pantechnicon to quite an unsuitable baileywick near cliffs, where the native peasants having never seen the mobile library before, stood in a ring around it, holding aloft their pitchforks and sticks tipped with tare burning rags gawping I think they may have it in mind to sacrifice the mobile librarian on a pyre Gosh, said marigold to

Frank Key  08:28
be that as it may continue to Dobson I barge my way through the season peasant throng and climbed into the pan technicon the wild barely person was engaged in some sort of haphazard reshelving exercise, oblivious of the peasants outside the mobile library holdings, including several thick and exhaustive reference books, one of which was critical to my research, like scattered about Higgledy Piggledy. Oh, I was sorely vexed, but I found what I wanted eventually, under a pile of paper back potboilers by pebble head and you have created a puddle on the floor. Dobson interrupted marigold to so soaked Are you from rainfall, finish your pipe and mop up the puzzle. And then you can continue your tail over a nice piping hot cup of Earth at Coco's substitute. And it was during the subsequent conversation that the out of print pamphleteer revealed to his puppet that he had indeed discovered the nature of a mosh pit. Apparently, he said, A mosh pit is an area where gaggles of frenzied teen persons hurl themselves about in an uncoordinated and rambunctious manner, to a soundtrack of improbably loud and thumping and often discordant electrified racket played from an adjacent stage or platform. by persons not dissimilar to the denizens of the mosh pit Yes, I know said marigold true. I could have told you that this morning over breakfast. I assume that now you know what a mosh pit is. You no longer want one in your own back garden. Quite the contrary, my sweet shouted Dobson with our nerving zest. I am over more determined to dig one hand me that spade. And though it was now dark, and the rain was pouring down more heavily than ever, Dobson was soon enough out in the garden under the dripping relief edge of Burnham and Sycamore and large digging a pit positing that he had taken leave of his senses marigold to retired to her boud wa tervis and Xavi a to get and his orchestra on the wireless. At some point in the small hours of the morning, Dobson came back indoors. He was covered in mud, as if he had been toiling in the trenches of Flanders Fields during the Great War. The cause of the shell shock suffered by smiddy alias Charles Ramya, the character played by Ronald Colman in random harvest, Mervyn Leroy 1942. marigold crew was fast asleep, but she was woken by a repetitive doll thumping noise as of bone cushioned by flesh bashing against wood over and over again. She went downstairs to find Dobson slumped at the kitchenette table, repeatedly thumping his forehead against its polished wooden surface. Whatever is the matter Dobson? she asked. Dobson looked up. The mosh pit is dug my dear. It needs about a complement of frenzied teen persons to be deposited within it. That is my quandary that the reason for my despair please explain Dobson, you have me utterly befuddled though it be the middle of the night. I'm going to put the kettle on for a nice piping hot cup of powdered milk slops enriched with filled butter nut flavoring. Pray continue. Well, said Dobson. It was only when I had finished taking the mosh pit and clambered out of it and stood back to admire my work in the brilliant illumination of Clyde lights that I realized the fatal flaw at the heart of my design. Which is sit asked marigold to we have not space in the garden sufficient to erect a stage or platform next to the mosh pit mounted Dobson. That's nowhere to assemble a group of persons to provide the necessary soundtrack of improbably loud and thumping, often discordant electrified racket to which frenzied teen persons so minded will marsh.

Frank Key  13:09
Look on the bright side, said marigold true. We may not have our own mosh pit, but now we have an all purpose pit. There is a myriad of usages, to which it could be put, I can think of several immediately, but I'll refrain from telling you right away. I think you need a disinfectant bath and a good night's sleep. Perhaps you are right, Buttercup, said to Dobson. And in any case, there may be such an activity as marching for the death, or marching to the sound of a lone Piccolo or other types of marching yet unimagined by frenzied teen persons, and by unfriended teen persons to tomorrow, I shall go to the mobile library again, assuming it has not been shoved over the cliffs by the baffled and menacing peasant, and I shall undertake further and more rigorous research. That is an excellent idea. Dobson said marigold true. But before plunging into your disinfectant bath, just tell me one thing. Why on earth did you want to have frenzied teen persons hurling themselves about in an uncoordinated and rambunctious manner, to a soundtrack of improbably loud and something and often discordant electrified racket in your own back garden in the first place? Last whatever Dobson said in reply, was drowned out by the piercing shriek of the now boiling kettle. Some days later, marigold to hike to the spade and filled in the pit under the leaf edge still dripping with rain of laburnum and Sycamore and large and strewn over it brambles and nettles and duckweed and never again did the word mark. ever passed Dobson's lips. Other matters had attracted his attention as related in his pamphlet, how I witnessed the sight of a wild and bearded mobile librarian in hand to hand combat with a snarling gag a low brain bridge jangled presents out of print.

Frank Key  15:50
Before moving on, I'd like to tell you a true story. On screen, Dick Van Dyke has been rescued from untimely death by flying cars, and magical nannies. Off screen. The veteran star of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins had to rely on the help of a pod of porpoises after apparently dozing off aboard his surfboard. I'm not kidding, he said afterwards. Dick Van dikes ordeal began during an ill fated trip to his local beach. I woke up out of sight of land. The 84 year old actor told Craig Ferguson on his TV track show. I started paddling with the swells and I started seeing fins swimming around me, and I thought I'm dead. Fan dike was wrong. They turned out to be porpoises, he said, and they pushed me all the way to shore. That's a story that appeared in The Guardian on the 11th of November last year under the headline, porpoises rescue Dick Van Dyke. porpoises rescue Dick Van Dyke is also the name of the brand new hooting yard paperback, because I was so inspired by this tale of friendly sea creatures pushing a veteran octogenarian actor safely ashore from his impairment on the wild ocean that I wrote 99 stories completely unrelated to it. And, and those 99 stories, which I've read on this show, have now all been collected in a paperback book with the glorious title, porpoises, rescue Dick Van Dyke, go to the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org and you'll find a picture on the cover. Click on that and it will take you to further details of how you can buy the book. Please buy it today. Because you'll make Dick Van Dyke very happy and me.

Frank Key  18:27
Now, I have a special treat now. There's a podcast. I know that hooting yard is the podcast for all Houdini artists. But there are sometimes other things worth listening to. One of them is called airy persiflage and airy persiflage persiflage comes from, I think, Virginia in the United States, where it's run by Walter O'Hara and Walter reads various things. And he's taken a liking to reading the works of Mr. Key and the latest of the airy Percy flowers. podcast features a play inverse that first appeared on the hooting yelled on the air some months ago, when I read it in companied by my son Ed, and for the airy persiflage version, Walter O'Hara is accompanied by young Gar, who I think is his son. Anyway, here it is. It's it's a new version, or a different version or the same words but read by someone else. I should shut up now and let you listen to it.

Unknown Speaker  19:42
Bring me a jar of lemon curd.

Unknown Speaker  19:45
Can such things be a talking bird? Why for just that want lemon curd?

Unknown Speaker  19:51
By chance this day my loins triggered

Unknown Speaker  19:54
I do not know that birds have loins. However, if you give me some coins, I will go and bind ajar there is a current shop not so far.

Unknown Speaker  20:02
I beg these in your use your own cash Should I praise is fine move stash. you'll move stash is very great. Now hurry up before it's too late.

Unknown Speaker  20:12

Unknown Speaker  20:15
but me No buts. Go buy my lemon curd or I shall be a distraught bird.

Unknown Speaker  20:21
I load the prospect of a bird distraught. It goes against everything I was taught. My parents put it very well be good to birds, or you'll go to hell.

Unknown Speaker  20:32
If I had hands I clap with glee this in your fears upsetting me. His childhood guilt. It haunts him yet. Make sure the lemon curd six set. I cannot bear it thin and runny.

Frank Key  21:33
That was great. I think much enjoyed it. There might be some more from Walter adhara next week, but I'll tell you about that next week. Anyway, the 2011 bulwer-lytton fiction contest awards have been announced. For those of you who don't know what the bulwer-lytton fiction contest is, it's I think it's from originated at San Jose University in California. But it's a prize every year for the worst opening lines of books or stories, bad writing, and sometimes that people write them deliberately bad prose in order to try and win. There's one passage there's one Prize winner this year. That as far as I'm concerned doesn't belong on the list because I would have been proud to write the sentence that made Mike Mayfield the runner up in the adventure category. Far from being bad writing deliberately or otherwise. I think this is superb. And rather hooting yardi Here it is. Sensing somehow a scuttling lay in the offing Skipper Bob tallied his tasks riff the main soul mizanin jib strike and Braille were fours all mizzen stays and baggy wrinkles, bows, the mainsheet jack lines and vang's Turtle and belay fast the small caulk Flemish the TAF rail walks, batten the booby hatch, lay by his sour Westar and find the baling bucket. So, you know, I think that's pretty good. Now, when I posted this on the hooting our website, I posted a link obviously to all the the to the winners and runners up and honorable mentioned. And among among the passages was this passage, which was mentioned in dispatches from David S. Nelson of Falls Church, Virginia. The howler monkey was sort of the leader of his troop, though not old enough to be a silverback, and not having fathered more than a couple of sounds. But he did know where the good berries were, and how to avoid the leopards. And a condors, and especially the hairless apes, the ones who crashed through the forest, only to stand behind a tree and breathe noisily and watch them and sometimes leave bunches of those disgusting bananas. Anyway, it is my lot as a Scribbler to research subject so you don't have to. It's selfless and noble and Ill paid work. But I do it uncomplainingly. Well, apart from those times increasingly frequent when I buttonhole bystanders at the bus stop or in the post office queue and unburden myself by delivery of a dyspeptic harangue, but otherwise I don't complain. So when a comment was left on the heating yard website on that post, a comment was left by outer Spaceman seeking further business. particulars of the howler monkey. So I set to the task with a will with them even with gusto. Granted at one point I did shout out of the window at a passing hoody person. But otherwise I spent uninterrupted hours with my head buried in the sorts of reference works where one might expect to find out all there is to be found out about howler monkeys. And I can now present my preliminary findings. The first thing to do is to cast from your mind everything David S. Nelson of Falls Church, Virginia has to say about erg the howler monkey. He is wrong, wrong wrong. And I think I know why. Mr. Nelson has almost certainly garnered all that stuff about berries and anacondas and noisy breathing and disgusting bananas from a collection of newspaper cuttings held in a cardboard box in the archives of one of the less reliable howler monkey Information Center libraries. It's a common enough mistake. You wouldn't guess from the PR guff put out by this particular library, that it's a hotbed of disinformation, possibly funded by communists and similar we the brain near do wells, but I guessed because I'm fab that way. And don't you forget it?

Frank Key  26:24
The newspaper cuttings are convincing forgeries, but forgeries. Nevertheless, by dint of the pincer like precision of my research, if I mean pincer like and I think I do, I can reveal exclusively that the deliberate counterfeiting of details of Urg the howler monkeys biography, serve their malign purpose, but fortunately not one with cataclysmic world shattering implications. Indeed, if the fiendish scheme had come to fruition, it would have had an effect only within the immediate vicinity of the Information Center, and the effect itself hideously awful as it would be would have dissipated within a day or so. It makes one wonder why some weedy brain ne'er do wells will go to such lengths. It really does. But perhaps that goes some way to account for the weakness of their brains. Having jettison the twaddle eagerly lapped up by Mr. Nelson, what are we left with? A monkey, a monkey which house and which is called Ergh. By God, it's not beyond the wit of man to track down such a creature and apprise oneself of the fact. That's why tomorrow, I shall embark upon the next stage of my research, having pored over the hefty leather bound directories on the mahogany shelves of a reliable howler monkey Information Center library and made voluminous notes in my notepad with my propelling pencil on the location of a number of promising howler monkey colonies. I've already purchased a return ticket to travel potentate class on a freight container ship sailing tomorrow morning for an appropriate continent by Pipi bag is packed and I'm ready to go. I'm standing here outside a door as Denver might have put it. I'm brimming with almost laughable self confidence that Upon my return, I will be in a position to write the definitive warts and all biography of Urg the howler monkey guaranteed to be 100% true, and fully illustrated with pencil sketches, watercolors, roto, gravures and mezzotints. I'm off bye bye
