Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM, or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. Just before I came to the studio, I was looking at a computer screen. And I'm not sure what prompted me to look for it, but I found a reproduction or a copy of the great headline from the New Musical Express in 1977 with a picture of Freddie Mercury, and we have a great headline is this man or Pratt? Which I thought was one of the one of the great enemy headlines. Anyway, that's completely irrelevant. And I will continue by pointing out to you that everyone has their favorite type of duck. And for prudence foxglove it was the bufflehead in the summer of 1894, the unsung Victorian genius took a break from writing her daringly modernist plays, and compiled a fact volume entitled, a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and song. It was illustrated with her own cack handed pencil drawings, which has to be said look much more like teal or mergansers than buffleheads. The dramatist had thousands of copies of the book printed at her own expense, a cost she could easily afford, after the astonishing success of her plays, such as see how the intoxicated Bruce wallows in a swamp of moral turpitude until his ravaged soul is up, uplifted by muscular Christianity in the percentage of a pugilist Vicar 1894 the closing scene in that fine play in which the Reverend Nabil Attenborough wrap sorry. In which the Reverend Nabi Attenborough rains, his boxing gloved fist down upon the head of the intoxicated brute, is unforgettable. Proven prudence foxglove I've been collecting snippets about buffleheads from books, periodicals and food packaging since childhood. Most girls of that era would have pasted their cuttings into a scrapbook, but prudence disliked both paste and scrapbooks. And instead, she stuffed her snipping into an ever burgeoning accumulation of burlap Gunny sacks. When a sack was plump and full, she stitched it up using exemplary needlework skills, and entrusted it to the keeping of one of her many gardeners for use as a pillow. The foxglove family estate have extensive grounds grown wild over generations of neglect, and it was prudence his mother hepzibah. improbably green fingered, who determined to tame them, employing hundreds of snag tooth peasants from the surrounding hovels, to dig and prune and hoe and herro. under the spell of the social reformer, Rufus crank hepzibah foxglove built a model of verbiage in for gardeners to live in. each had their own heart with guttering and drainage and a spigot and a sink and a pallet with a mattress and a shelf of improving cracked and prayer booked. Prayer books and a picture nailed to the wall of Christ commanding the woman to throw the sack full of beetles and locusts and flies and snakes and Hornets and wasps into the sea. It was unusual in those days for gardeners and other servants to have pillows. So prudence is Gunny sacks were particularly welcome. At her mother's insistence she had taken the precaution of seeking approval from Rufus crank himself by then over 90 the reformer wrote back to her in the famous pillows for gardeners letter, in which he laid out a set of principles we would do well to abide by today. If that is we still had gardeners in hearts in the grounds of our estate.

Be warned he wrote that a gardener plucked from his hovel and given a heart with modern appurtenances, such as a sink and a spigot may get hoity toity, if allowed to rest is oddly shaped head on a pillow. Yet krisztian compassion tells us, he must be given the chance to do so. The risk of hoity toity dentists can be tempered, if not wholly eradicated, by observing some general principles, rent the pillow to god no rather than giving it to him out right. stuff it not with Kpop nor duck feathers, nor soft downy and padman but with gravel or pebbles or sand, paper and cardboard cuttings on the subject of buffleheads are an acceptable stuffing in extremists. Use burlap Gunny sacks or other rough fabric. forbid pillowcases. Young prudence got herself into a tizzy when trying to decide how to charge the gardener's for pillow rental for they were unfamiliar with coinage being peasant. Then, at one of her mother's regular soirees, she met the so called potato economist Hicks, an extraordinary man whose theories ought to have resounded down the ages, but did not possibly because he expanded them in prose, so dense and clotted and awash with spelling errors that it was instilled is mistaken for gibberish. When he spoke, however, Hicks was a model of clarity. And as he stood next to a blazing half, the soiree is massive Victorian beard risk of catching fire. He told prudence to accept payment of pivo rent in potatoes. It was advice she took to heart so much so that As the years passed, and she grew to adulthood, and found worldly success as a playwright. Still, she found time each week to Pato from heart to heart in the grounds of the state, of which she was now the mistress, demanding and receiving a potato from each of the increasingly creaky gardeners, who at night rested their heads on pillows stuffed with her collection of bufflehead clippings. Many of these potatoes were destined for the grubby lodgings, where Hicks lived in poverty. Every Thursday morning, prudence foxglove impossible the potato, and took a horse and cart down to the village post office, where a new fangled pneumatic funnel system sent packages whizzing across the land. What Hicks did with always potatoes is an enduring mystery, for his diary is, if anything even less comprehensible than his published writings. At one point, it was thought a small clue was to be found in the startlingly fat book Table Talk of bearded Victorian intellectuals wearing Nestle's a report of a figure thought to be Hicks, standing next to a blazing half, making county observations upon the dreary dietary habits of impecunious bearded Victorian intellectuals in which the potato features prominently, but Hicks famously viewed the potato as a currency and he is unlikely ever to have eaten one. He was in any case, an unrepentant carnivore, having trained his stomach to digest liver and gravy in huge quantities. as recommended by the nutritionist Barstow, another bearded Victorian intellectual, but one who had never so far as we know, been invited to one of hepzibah foxgloves soirees after her mother was killed as a result of a cartographic mishap, prudence first continued with the soirees Hicks, Jetsam Baxter, cough drop fig and fig be were all regular visitors trudging across the filthy fields to the estate in all weathers, keen to propound their various nostrums and being plied with hibiscus syrup and water biscuit. While prudence is sister drew Suba tinkled something tinkled center Mental songs at the piano.

Frank Key  10:03
drusillas repertoire was small, but she compensated for it by devising hectic improvisational passages, so that a mournful dirge such as bring me your winding sheet, or mother of mine, which lasts about two minutes when played straight, could last up to 16 or 17 hours, by which time the assorted bearded Victorian intellectuals had often become so argumentative. That shouting and fisticuffs, were not uncommon. prudence is drudge complained about forever having to mop up bloodstains from the rug adjacent to the blazing house, and threatened to seek drudgery elsewhere. petrified that losing so Tyler's a mapa prudence decided to call a halt to the soirees. This life grew Scylla as a loose end, until she was persuaded to transcribe her piano pieces for a chorus of voices. And on their afternoons off, she trained and rehearse the gardener's leading them, leading them on loud and lusty sing songs, roaming across the fields and hills, and alarming cows and pigs and ponies. Without a drawing room full of pontificating, bearded Victorian intellectuals, prudence foxglove to may have found herself in won't have anything to occupy her. But instead, she sorry, but instead, she realized the solitary she relished the solitude and took her first faltering steps towards writing the plays which would make us rich and famous late in the future, and our early efforts were inverse and prose. She tried her hand at detective stories, ballads, nonfiction, a history of eggs, and a pistol later a novel and automatic writing dictated from the spirit world. For the letter, she had her arm twist in a canvas swing her hand grasping a steel pen, and spammed herself with laudanum. Publishers rejected everything she sent to them. With the single exception of the magazine mawkish chaff, which accepted her poem, the hopeless hollyhocks. Her excitement was somewhat dimmed when it turned out that the editor was a hicksite on paid for her poem and potatoes. Nevertheless, inspired by her appearance in the public print, or beat in a magazine with a tiny circulation, prudence foxglove fired off a series of similar pieces, including the Magoo Bria salute pins, the dismal dailies and a spinny choked with marshland weeds, and impressed the editor with her industry. He invited her to visit his office in a grim northern Milltown. And so it was that prudence found herself taking her first ever railway journey. The trip itself was uneventful, but not so her arrival at the grim northern Milltown railway station, the editor of mawkish calf came to meet her in person. He was a dashing CAD with exquisite manners on the morals of the sewer, and she actually disembarked from her train, he swept her into his arms, protested his undying passion for her cross to the platform to bundle her onto a small branch line, crying, and carried her away with him to a boarding house in a shabby seaside resort for a week of sinful debauch. Initially smitten prudence soon came to centers on the pretext of popping out of the boarding house to buy a couple of choc ices from a seafront kiosk. She went straight to the police station and shopped her seducer, as the CAD was carried off to clink by a team of roses. She took the train back to the grim northern Milltown let herself into the offices of mawkish cat with a key she had secretly had cut and set about running the magazine herself. prudence foxglove proved to be an edit tricks of genius. Pages once filled with sentimental pap now played host to extraordinary talents, as she called on all those bearded Victorian intellectuals who attended her soirees to pen essays and manifestos and epic poems and novellas and visionary burbling and occasionally automatic writing dictated from the spirit world while their arms were hoisting Handle swings.

Frank Key  15:02
Hicks himself was given three anti issues to expand his theories of potato economics, and then a further three when he decided he had not quite finished, followed by a couple of supplementary issues to tie up a few loose ends, and a Christmas special to repeat the more pertinent points. prudence was the first to publish both figs, hallucinate re ravings, and fig bees tweet nature notes. It was in mawkish chaff that cough drop predicted in the coming century, the appearance upon the world stage of a pamphleteer he mistakenly identified as bahnsen. Throughout the blizzard of editorial activity, prudence continued to cut out clippings about buffleheads and send them to drew silver, who had been charged with stuffing them into burlap, Gunny sacks and collecting the pillow rent from the gardeners. It's curious that not a single cutting was ever taken from prudence his own magazine, one can search through the bound volumes, and never once find the word bufflehead. Whereas the names of other types of ducks turn up frequently. Particularly Sheldrake rich were an obsessional interest of Baxter's no matter what he was meant to be writing about. Although she did not wholly neglect her own work during these years, penning a so called pneumatic romance and a study of the beards of Victorian intellectuals. prudence had yet to hit upon the formula that she would make her own. The germ of that first groundbreaking play with a walk she took through a patch of broken ground in the shadow of a grim mill one Sunday, she chanced upon a derelict, slogging a bottle of tarps and babbling to himself and approached him with a charitable tuppence in her outstretched hand. The human wreckage grabbed at her wrist, and would not let go, and prudent resisted with an awful Pang, that it was her boarding house CAD. And sorry, and prudence realized with an awful Pang that it was her boarding house CAD, his manners were no longer exquisite, and his morals were no longer even of the sewer, for they had been utterly blasted away through strong drink and turpentine. She had him carted off to an asylum in the hope that he would one day rickover and visited in there on subsequent Sundays, listening to his incoherent jabbering, as he told her his story, from the despair of prison to the greater despair of the broken ground in the shadow of the grim mill. She felt impelled to share his terrible tale with the world, and it became the basis of her play. The dashing but divorced CAD, and his descent into a Netherworld of turpentine fueled depravity. 1894. writing it, she realized her inborn talent for dramatic dialogue, stage directions, interludes of knockabout comedy, emotionally wrenching, climaxes, and daring modernist interventions are a matter of being something perhaps to drusillas piano and choral techniques. From the very first performance in which the legendary actor manager sir Hector bombast, played the dashing but debauch CAD, the play, left it audience stand. prudence foxglove had found her Muse and her future was assured. She returned the reins of the magazine to the now partially recovered CAD and headed back to her a state, where her many decrepit gardeners and her drug, welcomed her as a heroine, Drew Suba to was overjoyed to have her sister back, so she had grown lame and the weekly traipsing from house to house to collect the pillow rent had become a sore trial to her. There was a folly next to our haha in the grounds of the estate, and prudence took it as her writing room. The plays pulled out of her on an almost daily basis, and soon enough, dramas were being put on in every theater in the land.

Frank Key  19:45
For us, it was come the summer she decided to take a break. One fine Friday afternoon she took delivery of a set of sandbags and wheeled them in a narrow in a barrel around the gardener's house, retrieving each of her burlap Coming sacks and leaving a sandbag in its place. Then holed up in her folly by the ha ha. She emptied out the sack and laborious Lee copied out each and every bufflehead related clipping into a series of exercise books. When she was done, she took the horse and cart to the village post office and sent the in bundled books to a printer. A month later, she received father pneumatic funnel system, thousands of copies of a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and song. Unlike a place It was not a success to public had come to expect from her stern moral invective, drunken brutes, comedic drapes crippled orphans, vapid driveling, pugilistic Vickers and daring modernism. None of these was to be found in what was after all, just a forbiddingly fat anthology of miscellanea about ducks when prudence foxglove died in 1922, all but one of the copies was found rotting in packing cases in the cellar of her estate, and that single presumably sold copy. The story is told that its owner, a grandnephew of Hicks had it in his luggage when he stepped aboard the airship Hindenburg, in Frankfurt on the Third of May 1937.

That took up most of the program didn't it was a little more than seven minutes left, but I think we've got time to redo this. It's called the family pig. The phosphorescent family had a pet pig. Its name was Baptist, and it lives in a sty and the family compound. This compound was similar to the Kennedy compound hyannisport, home of the Irish American political dynasty. But in the case of the phosphorescent compound, it should be noted that they tool wire fence surrounding the property was like the family phosphorescent. The pig, by the way, was not. leafing through some old back numbers of the hammer of Christ. The other day, I came upon an article recounting the tale of how the phosphorescent family obtained their pig. It was not a very interesting story, and I suspect it found its way into the magazine because the author was in possession of potentially explosive information about the editor. Never underestimate the amount of squalor unseemliness, blackmail and extortion in which even the most well regarded periodicals wallow. Anyway, the article has it that one day the patriarch of the phosphorescent family, old Pappy fosse, was leaning on a clump of gak in the compound, staring at the sky lost in wonder. When he heard distant grunting he rushed indoors to check his reel to reel tape recorder. For like everyone else in the family. He was a keen tape recordist of distant sound, whether they were grumpy to house or gunfire, or squelching. The phosphorescent family like nothing better of an evening than to sit around splicing together tape loops of various distant sounds, and then playing them in unison. Over the years, representatives from record companies and avant garde music festivals in olm, had come bashing the gates of the compound offering huge sums of money for these recordings, but they were always sent away empty handed and with phosphorous burns in the very center of their foreheads. The family had no interest in the stardom that would inevitably have swept them up, had their tape bloops gone to the top of the hit parade. On the evening that they listened to old Pappy Hall FOSS recording of distant pig grunting It so happened that one of the tinier members of the family piped up with a query about the source of the sound told me it was a pig she begged for a pig of her own. It was gently explained to her that a pig needs a sty to move in and there was no STI in the compound. Then I fell, build one myself, and whether it's with phosphorescent muck she cleaned before bursting into tears. And the very next day she did, and so impressed was the family by her initiative and energy, that old Patty fosse strode out across the fields and abducted the very same pig whose grunting is now played on a continuous a loop on the tape recorder next to the tiny girl's bed. It was her cousin Armand fosse, a Franco file, who named the pig Baptist. As I said, it's not a particularly interesting tale, but I thought it worth sharing with you, if only because it gives us a first dim insight into the lives of the phosphorescent family. From a selfish point of view, it allowed me to make use tangentially, but to my satisfaction of the word. Readings have been taken from the soil, the pig has been chosen. These words came to me in my dream last night. We have phosphorescent Mark rather than soil and the peg was abducted rather than troezen. But I've kept faith with my not yet quite awake brain. And that's good enough for me. And so it ought to be good enough for you.

Now I'm well aware that most if not all, listeners will be a gorg to know what's happening with pansy cradle jus sock, which we she was knitting in the Vive in the studio last week. It was the second sock, as you will recall, panties aren't able to be with us this week, or she has important wall business to attend to. But she gave me a note to read to update you on the progress knitting progress with the second sock, the lock knitted live on the radio sock, which, of course is the second of two socks. Unfortunately, I dropped the note into a puddle on the way here and it became so smudged that I can't read it. So I'm afraid you're just going to have to wait in enormous suspense to find out the fate of the second sock. That will not come to you next week, because next week is the resonance fundraising week. And I unfortunately will not be here. However, you will be able to bid in the resonance auction for an original artwork by me, which is about 30 years old in full color done by hand and worth. I don't know, thousands of pounds probably. So I do recommend that you make a bid for that. Um, and yeah, that's about it, I think. Is there anything else I need to say, john? No. Okay, well, that's the end of this week's show. I'll be back in two weeks. I'll read you some more stuff, possibly about buffleheads. And I'll give you an update on pansy cradle Jews second sock. Bye bye.
