Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air four minutes late because of some technical glitch, but don't worry about that because the exciting thing is we have live music this week. The piano played by Daisy dorma court. Yes, so this is hurting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And as usual, I'm going to read to you but for slightly less time than I normally do. When you remove your brand new oXby steering panel from its box, do remember that you can put all of the packaging materials to good use, not just the box itself, but the string, the adhesive tape, the rubber bands and the Excelsior. The latter, for example can provide comfortable bedding for your hamster if you have a hamster. Or if you do not have a hamster for some other small scurrying mammal you keep as a pet, such as a guinea pig or a water vole. If you have neither a hamster, nor a guinea pig, Nora waterfowl, what the hell is wrong with you? Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have let that slip. It's perfectly possible to be a fine, upstanding citizen of unimpeachable moral character without lavishing your love on a small scurrying mammal. Love can be lavished elsewhere, it can be held in abeyance awaiting the exquisite prick of Cupid's Dart, or it cannot be lavished at all smothered by yet nobler sentiments, if there are any. But even in such an extreme case, you can still make use of the Excelsior if you have no small scurrying mammal to provide bedding for what about your own bedding, the most comfortable mattress in the universe can be made that little bit plumper with the addition of a brand new oXby steering panels packaging worth of Excelsior. Simply slice a slit in your mattress with a sharp blade, cram the Excelsior in and then sew up the gash with a length of Draper's wall, I guarantee you will sleep twice as soundly thereafter. And if at any point in the future, you are waylaid by pangs of love for small scurrying mammals and decide to obtain a hamster or a guinea pig or a waterfowl. After all, you can always rip open the slit in the mattress by tugging savagely at the Draper's wall, remove the Excelsior, and then read down. If you want to ensure that your chosen pet is as comfortable as can be, there's nothing to stop you from seizing a few handfuls of the original mattress stuffing and adding that to the Excelsior. With your mattress, no longer optimum plumpness you may no longer sleep so soundly, but you probably wouldn't. In any case, given that you will spend many hours of your future night watching over your hamster or guinea pig or waterfowl burning with love. I haven't forgotten about the box and the string and the adhesive tape and the rubber bands, or indeed the Oglesby steering panel itself. untold hours of fun and frolic to be had with each of these items, singly or in combination, I mean in combination with each other, for example, the string and the box or the rubber bands and the string or the adhesive tape and the oXby steering panel and the box or the rubber bands and the adhesive tape and the string and so on. But I can see there was some ambiguity there. And you may have thought I meant in combination with the small scurrying mammal upon which you lavish your love. If that is what you thought you're correct, for there are lots of games you can play such as jump off the box like little Ruskin dangle was string in front of the hamster. Shake the rubber bands in front of the guinea pig and manipulate the adhesive tape into a sticky entangled mess in front of the water bowl. These and other pastimes will keep the pet you adore in chanted, although sometimes it can be difficult to tell. teaching your small scurrying mammal to take control of the Ormsby steering panel sitting with the wheel in its paws wearing goggles is a much more ambitious project, and one you would be willing ill advised to pursue without proper training.

I'd like to do a song now. Regular listeners will know that I can't sing for toffee so I don't even attempt to but I'll read it in an excitable voice perhaps. And then you can pretend I'm singing. And with a bit of luck, Daisy will do some piano accompaniment so that we can all pretend we're in a Victorian musical. Here we go then, with my siphon and funnel I march to the hills stamping on insects adds to my kills. I have distributed thousands of pills, and now I must hide in a grot my siphon my siphon, I dropped it back there. I must go and fetch it while the weather stands fair. I will need it within my elfin grata layer, so I retrace my steps at a trot. My pathway is barred by a night at arms, alone and pale. He lacks all charms. I think I have seen him patrolling the farms, the farms where I poisoned the poultry. Paoli, loitering like a monitor lizard, the night plunges his alarms right into my gizzard. I am no night. I'm a pinball wizard cries this latter day Roger Daltrey. I crumpled to earth and let for my funnel. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. A cliche I know. But as long as the sun will shine I'll stay clear of the fiery pit. The Wizard 12. a mic on the end of a lead by Christ is Roger adultery indeed, is he going to sing in my hour of need? He's such a preposterous get. I reached for my funnel and chuck it at him. But the light at the end of the tunnel grows dim, my immediate prospects are decidedly grim. To die at the hands of the Who? See me, feel me? Touch me. I groan No, you must reap what you have sown. says don't tree as I wail and moan. I am but left to rule. I ruled that I killed every hen every duck or we innocent pigs in their filthy muck. I was being an evil countryside Park. Now I just want my mommy gore spouts for my gizzard. My life leaks away. But worse is to come for I call it a day with his awful hair like a bale of hay. Don't curry shakes it and starts to sing Tommy. The last the mercy of God Duff abide as he opened his gob I died.

Speaking of figures from the 60s and 70s and those kind of decades, and one of the more distressing Verbal infelicities committed by young persons nowadays is the string of their utterances with in it as in, I was like unlike God in it. My chief objection is that it's almost always ungrammatical. It used to be the case that in it was a truncation of isn't it? But if you listen carefully to teen persons they're in it can really be construed as such. The changing fads and fashions of Teamspeak are a mystery at least to me for I haven't studied these matters properly. But I think I've stumbled upon the reason why it has become so ubiquitous. A few weeks ago, I watched a snippet on BBC fours john lennon night. It was an edition of Top of the Pops to recorded some years ago, in which Yoko Ono did little introductory pieces to camera for a selection of songs by her bespectacled Liverpudlian husband. And the program began with Yoko saying,

Unknown Speaker  08:57
we didn't think give peace a chance would be a big song, but it is in it.

Frank Key  09:04
Yoko was of course using it in a grammatically correct manner. But I'm convinced that a generation of young persons heard this when it was originally broadcast and bowled over by the beetle relict verbal flourish truly began to imitate her on any and every occasion, and thus forced to revise my view of in it, and will henceforth say a little prayer for world peace and a wish for no possessions whenever I overhear it.

This next piece is actually going to involve Daisy, the pianist reading something as well. So he'll have to make his way from the piano to a chair next to me. And when he's done that, we can begin I'd like to begin by reading a quotation from the home life of great authors by Hattie ting Griswold, published in 1886. Get your pens and paper ready and listened very carefully. In the beginning of the 18th century, the great grandfather of the famous Lord Macaulay, the author of the glowing and impassioned history of England, was minister of Tyree and coal. When his stipend was taken from him, the instance of the lit led of art Chatham the slight inconvenience of having nothing to live upon, did not seem to incline the old minister in the least degree, to resign his charge and to teach and to seek a flock who could feed their shepherd. He stayed valiantly on doing his duty faithfully by his humble people. But after some time had elapsed, his health being much impaired, and there being no church or meeting house, he was exposed to the violence of the weather at all seasons, and having no man's or Glebe, and no fun for communion elements. And having no mortification for schools or other pious purposes in either of the islands, and the air being unwholesome, he was finally compelled to leave much to his own regret, and that of his poor little flock. So, that's a passage from the home life of great offers by hackie Ting Griswold, and it can be used as a comprehension test. So instruct the tinies in your charge to read it carefully, and allow sufficient time so that even the dimwits and the ones who drew will be able to complete the task, standing imperiously your lectern, your arms folded in the manner of the Reverend JC M. belleau. Roar at the top of your voice, the following set of questions designed to test the tiniest comprehension. They could scrape their answers on this slate. And with the assistance of Daisy dorma court, I'm now going to give model answers. So, in case you yourself have failed to comprehend the passage, perhaps because your brain is fuming with visions of sprites and monsters. Here are the questions and the model answers. What did the lead take from the minister?

Unknown Speaker  12:33
The lead took from the minister his stipend

Frank Key  12:36
in the jaws of utter destitution? What was the minister's admirable cast of mind the ministers cast of mind was valiant. What was the outcome for the ministers health after some time had elapsed

Unknown Speaker  12:49
after some time had elapsed, the ministers health was much impaired.

Frank Key  12:53
To what feature of the weather was the minister exposed

Unknown Speaker  12:56
in all seasons, the minister was exposed to the violence of the weather.

Frank Key  13:01
We are told the minister had no maths. What else had he not?

Unknown Speaker  13:06
The minister had not a Glebe

Frank Key  13:08
name to other things the minister had not. The minister

Unknown Speaker  13:12
had not a fund for communion communion elements nor mortification for schools.

Frank Key  13:17
For what else might the minister had been able to use mortifications had he had them?

Unknown Speaker  13:23
Had he had mortifications the minister could have used them for pious purposes?

Frank Key  13:27
Where would the minister have pursued his pious purposes, the Minister

Unknown Speaker  13:31
would have pursued his pious purposes in Terry and Cole both

Frank Key  13:36
describe the air

Unknown Speaker  13:38
the air was unwholesome, unfettered, and murky and rank and corrupt and pathetic and damp, and vile and foul.

Frank Key  13:51
And the music starts out but of course this week is alive but that didn't work. Excellent. Daisy's returning to the PLO, and we'll play a little bit now and I'll shut up.

Frank Key  14:18
See, this is the exciting resonance live experience, you just never know what's going to happen. And, in considering the career of the killer babinski the jaws even of the most imperturbable researchers drop when this is realized how frequently the deranged brute out witted the coppers who were forever in pursuit of him in their Chronicle, a doll worker day assessment of the vile criminal babinski for example, those two old So besides totteridge and whetstone, right. When we thought about the seeming ease with which babinski always escaped the clutches of the plod, we were both designed to reduce joy dropped, while whetstone banged his head repeatedly against the granite wall, as on page 429. The received wisdom in the matter is that Dubinsky had innumerable layers and hidey holes to which he fled from caves by the sea shorter chalets in the hills. While this is of course true, it doesn't address the question of how the lumbering psychopath evaded capture time and time again between the site of his slaughter and the layer in which he hid. Recent research by a writer who could show totteridge and whetstone a thing or two when it comes to maintaining the reader's interest reveals that they've been ski was a master of disguise. In babinski master of disguise, the Korean historian of blood drenched enormities Park no lip writes not for bubinski weedy rousses, such as the adoption of a limp and the padding out of his streaks with cotton wall is genius lay in his ability to impersonate real people. Following the slaying of the Punch and Judy man at the end of the pier in sawdust on see over 100 coppers lay in wait for babinski on the promenade. They were nonplussed when several minutes after the screams and gurgles had died away. Off the pier walked Barbados at the boulevard of Magnifico with the port of a Spanish Hidalgo, a gold knob cane in his right hand, a little mirror in his left there one to emphasize the other to confirm his identity. He pronounced across the promenade onto the boulevard quite unmolested, and made his escape. It was of course not Dharavi at all. It was babinski. The very next day, a few miles inland in the awful little village of gak. He killed a monkey trainer named Perkins, and made such a racket while doing so that dozens of police cars screeched up to the hovel, where in the fell deed was done. The coppers formed a ring of steel around the hovel, and waited for the maniac to emerge. hours passed. Eventually, Detective Captain kargh pan himself babinski his nemesis strode to the door and banged his big black big gloved fist upon it. It's opened, and they're in the fetid gloom, so the picturesque striking looking past them, the Reverend john chip and nor Montesquieu Belew, who's head of hair was like a great bowl of spun white silk, a magnificent orator and adored by women, he lived becomingly in an atmosphere of adulation constant enough to turn an ordinary man's brain. He certainly turned the brains of karg pan on his toughs who swooned like girlies as the past and climbed into one of the police cars and drove away. Several more hours passed before but witless coppers realized that the man they thought was Belew was in fact, the killer babinski. Park no lip harbors Labour's the point with a dozen also further examples. But it's fascinating stuff and certainly sheds new light on the man they called the killer babinski next week we'll be taking a closer look at the interior decoration of some of his layers and chalets paying particular attention to wallpapers and sideboards

from babinski to Blodgett one vile broiling August afternoon, Blodgett sold his birthright for a mess of pottage ever the Wheeler Dealer, he then immediately sold the mess of pottage to a wealthy fool for 30 pieces of silver. Blodgett licked his lips and punch the air with his hairy fist. At last, he thought, I have sufficient funds to organize a picnic in the garden of guests cemani Blodgett traveled to the by hot air balloon. He was accompanied by his next door neighbors at the time, a peevish couple who rarely spoke directly to each other, but babble incessantly. Blodgett who eventually stuffed cotton wool into his is that all his fault. Blodgett was a singularly honorable fellow, and he felt a sense of obligation to Mr. And Mrs. Fagor for a favor done to him long ago. Though he could no longer remember what it was. Thus, he was able to kill two birds with one stone, as they say, by fulfilling a personal picnicking ambition at the same time as repaying a moral debt by providing a treat for an elderly impoverished couple. The picnic hamper was an exact replica scaled down of the balloon basket. The Wicker of which both were woven had even come from the same wicker factory. Blodgett had stopped hamper before the voyage with mK provena from his favorite picnic supplies shop. without bothering to quiz Mr. And Mrs. fag Ash on any dietary preferences they may harbor he had spent some of his pieces of silver on sausages and lemonade and sandwich paste and pork scratchings and Flan and jam and buns and the salt tanners and mashed potatoes and raw liver and marang and plums and milk. The threesome took it in turns to keep flies away by waving fans of the same wicker as the hamper and the balloon basket. Flies they knew would find a way to wriggle through the tiniest gaps in the wickerwork. If it had been vile, and broiling back at home, it was even more vile and more broiling in the garden of a guest feminie when their balloon basket thumped to Earth. Blodgett himself broke out in a sweat so deep, it was as if it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground like Christ. Hearing a series of bangs from inside the hamper, he realized the sausages were exploding. Mrs. Fagor, who was a devout Catholic, suggested they seek shelter from the sun in the Miss named grotto of the agony, and as they staggered towards it, she explained the misnomer, dating back to the removal of a stone in the 14th century. Blodgett found it hard to follow what she was saying and resolve the consulter reference work. When he returned home after the picnic. He was beginning to wonder how sinful it would be to abandon Mr. And Mrs. fag ash in the Grotto and make the trip back alone. In all the years he had dreamed of this picnic, Blodgett never envisaged that he would find himself sitting in a dark cave eating raw liver in the company of a pair of scowling geriatrics. Even the lemonade had gone flat, due to a bottling mishap, as he chewed and glugs and swatted away flies, he reflected that perhaps he would have been better not to sell his mess of pottage, which even now the wealthy fool would be lapping up in the cool luxury of a shaded Arbor. And He further reflected that it might have been better never to have sold his birthright for the mess of pottage in the first place. For what had he gained, what had he gained? It was this thought as gloomy as the gloom of the Grotto. That was bloating in Blodgett brain when inside the hamper, the last unexploded sausage exploded with a mighty bang. Bird scattered from the branches of the olive trees outside. That gives me Mr. And Mrs. Fagor for I know not what I do, blurted Blodgett, he stood up, flicked crumbs from his person and sprinted out of the Grotto of the agony across the garden to the hot air balloon. He clambered into the basket and set the burners roaring, and very soon he was aloft and he sailed away into the blue.

Finally, this week, a quotation from the table talk of john Selden published in 1689 in Queen a list time, gravity and state was kept up in King James time things were pretty well within Kate Charles time, there has been nothing but trench more and the cushion dance Omnium gatherum Tali Polly Hoyt come tight so let that be a warning to you if you're not careful where we trench more on the cushion downs Omnium gatherum Tali, Polly and Hoyt come toit instead of gravity and state. Not if you listen to hooting yard on the air, and I'd like to thank Daisy dormer court Very much we're playing live piano for us. And despite a few teething problems with the the show because of various other things in my forgetting that no one was going to turn the radio on, or something. I'll stop babbling now and I'll be back next week. Bye bye
