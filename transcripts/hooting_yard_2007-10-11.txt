Good evening, this is hooting Yod on the air and my name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour. I'm going to begin with a piece a few months ago or probably earlier this year, February or March, I read a piece about hiking pickles, you know the kind of pickle that can occur when you're hiking. And today I want to address the equally important topic of putting flaps flaps about putting are rarer than they once were. chiefly because puddings play a less critical role in our diets than used to be the case. Time was when no meal was innocent of a pudding. And though of course not every pudding preparation was the occasion of a flap. The incidence of such flaps was obviously more frequent. One or two psycho culinary statisticians have attempted to put a precise figure on the occurrence of putting flaps and one feels pity for them. Pity mixed with mocking laughter. Sooner or later, I think we're going to have to accept that we'll never know how often the making of a pudding was done in a state of flap, certainly not to a statistically significant extent. The implications of this are of course that I may be able to say nothing pertinent about putting flaps safe or what I've already said that they used to be more common than they are in the gilded paradise we live in today. And it is a sort of Eden as we zoom around the glistening Metropolis in bendy hava buses, printing our Buffon's with space age printing tweezers, scanning the electronic information silos for the latest diktats from our supreme leader, the great Helms woman Hazel Blears, plugging our pods into hubs, enduring cataclysmic hailstorms with undiminished joie de vive. And taking our state provided one pig per person policy pig for a brisk walk through the concrete underpasses below the boulevards. Yet Some say it's a fool's paradise. And they may be right. Perhaps there's a deep primeval human need to get into a flap when preparing a pudding, whether it's a pudding of suid, or of plums, or greasy slops, or loss of those flaps, at least in our daily lives has cost us dear.

So I wasn't not a vision of a utopia with a one state provided one pig per person, policy pig. And this next piece is a story called a bit of a kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn. It's a story about a bit of a kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn, and one man's search for the truth. Last week, there was a bit of a kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn. This was very shocking. Those of us who keep an eye on such things they used to the seemingly endless series of kerfuffles taking place at the bins by the docks. But for the bins outside the barn to be targeted by agencies of kerfuffle them was a frightening development. I had more reason than most to be concerned. I knew that my reaction to the kerfuffle would be watched very closely, that judgements would be made upon me, and that if I did not acquit myself, Well, I may as well give up any hopes I had of wallowing like a voluptuary in the hot embrace of the bins board. That's it was that as soon as I heard about this unexpected kerfuffle, I grabbed a rag and buffed my badge, and I pinned the buffed badge to my cap, and I placed the cap firmly upon my head, and I held my head erect in a manner that gave me an air of True Grit. And I clamped my pipe between my teeth, drafted my jaw, and did a set of botsman exercises, my favorite ones from the second Handbook, before jumping into my jalopy and barreling along the lanes at tremendous speed, popping my home to scatter the various infantry. And small domestic animals in my path. Truly it could be said on that October morning with its sense of collapse. That urgency was my middle name rather than Lembit, which was the middle name my parents God rest their souls gave me weeks before my birth before they knew whether I would be a boy or a girl. I was only too aware you see that the bins board was due to meet in the ceremonial chamber of the big dragon castle that very evening, and that I would be held to account. Just past sawdust bridge I swerved off into the field cranking the gears to no apparent purpose watched by a clump of disconsolate cows. If cows could talk, they might be able to tell me something about the kerfuffle. There are lands where cows are intelligent and voluble, so I'm told, but this is not one of them. The first time I heard about such cows, I was frankly incredulous, even though I was at my mother's knee, and I had no reason to distrust that saintly woman. Later, as I accepted that she told me only that which was true, I was stricken with a sense of menace. I did not know what talking Kaos talked about, but I was and remain convinced that such knowledge would shatter my brain and leave me dribbling and twittering best not even to think about it. But to be on the safe side, I waved a hail fellow well met greeting the nearest cow in the clump and sped onwards. Within minutes, I was pulling up at the edge of the compound where in the band stood numinous like a monolith. Here I must make a confession. You're probably sitting there thinking how fab I am by selfless devotion to the doings of the bins board evidence of a remarkable sense of civic responsibility. Even now, you may be planning to pin up a big poster of me in the vicinity of your infant's cot, or its playpen, the better to inculcate it to tiny cranium with my example of how to lead a valuable life in this land of wordless cows. The grammar of that last sentence may be askew, but Forgive me put it down to an attack of the vapors. For sadly, you must put the drawing pins back in the drawer and never think of holding me up as an exemplar of anything but petty ambition. You see, it's within the gift of the bins board to award the tenancy of a building next to the barn, and that's within the compound. And for as long as I can remember, I have been besotted by the idea of living in a compound like the Kennedys with their famous Kennedy compound at Hyannis port or Kennebunkport or wherever the hell it is. The building next to the bomb had been vacant for months. Ever since the last tenant, old man Widdecombe had been convicted of the toffee apple wrapper slayings and banged up for the rest of his sordid life in a prison Hulk of hooligans Wharf.

I knew the bins board was struggling to agree on who was worthy to take on the tenancy. Just as I knew that this might be my last chance to live in a compound. That is why I buffed my badge with such vigor and why I held my head at so decisive angle. In truth, the prospect of winning that award. That tendency was the motivation for everything I did in all my waking hours. Gorgeous lanterns hung on the perimeter fence of the compound, all filigree and glitter and stripes, adding much needed glamour to the scene. I did not have my own key, of course, and so hectic had been my dash towards the bottom that I had not given a thought to what faced me now. Before I could examine the site of the shocking kerfuffle about the bins, I would have to get past the bloated janitor who control access to the compound. I have the right of entry, the buffed badge on my cap signal that much, but the janitor was a notoriously difficult man. The two things everybody noticed about him was that he was bloated and he was difficult. His name was Ajax and his patrimony was squalid. To his credit, he had shaken off the sins of his fathers, and not even the faintest whiff of squalor hung around his bloated frame. Indeed, he gleamed with a cleanliness that in any other janitor would have been suspicious, and his teeth were impeccable. Once I have tried to prize from him the identity of his dentist, who I was sure was a practitioner of the so called New dentistry, but he folded in upon himself in a surprisingly graceful way for so bloated a janitor and I learned nothing, nothing at all. Now many years Later, I had to hope that he would let me into the compound without any fast for I could not afford any delay. urgency was still my middle name on foot just as behind the wheel of my jalopy which I had parked skillfully under the bowels of a titanic Sycamore. The sun was not shining. But if it did emerge from behind the fluffy clouds, it would not shine upon my jalopy except intermittently as breezes blew the sycamore boughs, and it was important to me that this was so I'm not suggesting that there was anything vampiric about my jalopy. Or perhaps I am simply that it performs better in the dark or in the shade. I Drax detained me at his little janitorial bunker for over an hour. He was in a garrulous mood, babbling away about a potato based toothpaste among other things. He was clearly taunting me for my decade ago inquiries about his dentist, but I was not amenable to his joshing biting my lip so hard I drew blood. I felt as if I'd been kissed by Sylvia Plath, or by Ted Hughes, or by both. I cannot remember whose fangs gouged who their first meeting. When he had had his fun with me, the bloated janitor finally allowed me to pass and I hurried over to the bins outside the barn where the kerfuffle had occurred. Post kerfuffle, forensics is an inexact science. And it could fairly be said that I was flailing around in a morass of uncertainty. It would not be the first time that could be said about me. And that was why I was so tormented. I was desperate to have something concrete to present to the bins board at the meeting, which was due to begin in a few hours. For something to do, I took a tape measure for my pocket and worked out how far from the wall of the bomb the bins were. Then I walked widdershins around the barn twice, peering intently, but ignorantly at the muck on the ground.

Was there evidence of squirrels or of mold or have gigantic grotesque mutations there of it was hard to tell. I remember the time when one of my lungs had collapsed and I lay stricken in a clinic, and with my head twisted to one side, spent hour upon hours staring out of the window, the many different types of birds that appeared in my little corner of the sky, and how very slowly I learned to distinguish one from another and to marvel at their valiant mastery of the empyrion and their savagery, particularly the savagery of owls. These thoughts came sloshing through my brain as I completed my second circuit of the barn, and back at the bins I tore my eyes from the muck and looked up, up into the immensity of the sky. Suddenly, I was convinced beyond a smidgen of doubt, that it was up there, up in the boundless firmament that I would discover the secret of the kerfuffle bother bins outside the barn, owls maybe, but more likely, some kind of goals, ferocious goals with razor sharp beaks and talons that could tear the planet to shreds. Given that my jalopy had been thieved, by a subset of the near do wells who loitered by the compound, and who I had completely forgotten about in my urgency, and given that I thus had to catch a bus along the impossibly winding lanes to Pang Hill hot air balloon station. It's remarkable that I managed to present myself before the bins board that evening on the dot. But I did, and I was not even disheveled. If anything, my cap was set at an even more punctilious angle than it had been earlier. And the undulant goo I had applied to my bloody lips gave them a healthy gloss. I swear that the bins board went collectively weak at the knees, as I promised into the ceremonial chamber. Soft Light from the chandelier is falling upon me like a sprinkling of fairy dust. I knew I was in for hard and even merciless questioning, but I felt like a champion. As the members of the bins board shuffled their papers and cleared their throats. I reflected that this was my fictional athletes Bob net to vol moment, my triumph. I fancied that I could smell the entrance port of the building next to the barn in the compound, my compound, never again would I be taunted by Ajax the bloated janitor. I stepped onto the blue wall and Matt and presented my findings to the bins board, but such a picture of emotion. There was a catch in my voice as I began, but I quickly recovered and delivered a masterpiece of oratory like an ancient god booming the law had a few questions for me all of which I handled within a plum that would have astonished my mother, who feared during my infancy that I would be as inarticulate as one of the cows of this precious land.

Frank Key  15:18
This morning was a torture. I fretted and jumped about waiting, waiting. The bins board had announced that today, a week after the meeting, I would be informed of their adjudication in the matter of the kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn. Cold reason told me that this was their perfect opportunity to award me the tenancy of the building next to the bomb. That was always how these things were done. And so I fretted and jumped about and waited and waited for posty to come skipping up the path. He was late, when eventually he appeared on the far horizon. I sprinted to meet him, jabbering like a Dunder pate. I snatched the bins board communique from his puny grip, sliced it open with the fiercest blade on my very fierce military knife. And I read following the unexpected and shocking kerfuffle, down by the bins outside the barn, and the hot blooded and exciting report we received there upon it is our unanimous and typically Sparky decision in the matter, to order the immediate demolition down to dust of the entire compound and all buildings within it in the interest of both public safety and Ajax the bloated janitor whose whim it is that he wants to retire to a gloomy seaside resort. Be it enacted this very day, and God bless you each and every one

as positively hooting yard careers advice, outreach service, and here's some careers advice. If you want to pursue a career as a robber baron, the very first step you need to take is to establish your baronetcy. You need to ensure that it has at least a pattern of legitimacy for you do not want naysayers and busybodies, calling it into question. youngsters who seek my advice are often surprised that wearing a burnished golden helmet while sitting astride a mighty steed is not in itself sufficient claim to be a Baron. Of course, it's essential to have such a helmet and such a horse. No self respecting robber baron could expect to go about his baronial robberies without them. But I'm afraid the drudgery of paperwork has to take precedence. You can pluck the name of your baronetcy out of the air marches, you might invent the name of a monster in a bedtime story for tinies. But if possible, it's best to take on the appellation of a genuine baronetcy, one that has fallen into disuse or chewed whether last Baron died hundreds of years ago without issue. Many barons fell in battle in far distant land. So a good start would be to check up on the manifests of ruinous military expeditions. Obviously, whenever a Baron fell on the open battlefield, it was almost certainly unhorsed. So that serves as a reminder to you to choose your steed Well, when we come to the prickly topic of steed choosing once you've picked an extinct baronetcy to revive you only the coat of arms don't fuzzle your head too much with all those heraldry words like a jewel and ghouls and rampant and Argent and cushions. Just make sure you have something that pleases you and that will look good and blazoned on the shields carried proudly by your masked outriders. You might be able simply to appropriate the actual coat of arms of the dead Baron you have supplanted, but to do so risks alerting the busy bodies and you might be faced with hard questions you'll be in no position to answer. In any case, nothing could be easier than designing a coat of arms. It really is child's play. You can even hire an orphan from Pang Hill to do the job for you. With your Baronet to secure ish and a spindly often beavering away Your coat of arms, the time has come to obtain a mighty steed. I cannot emphasize enough just how important this is. Without a suitable horse, all else is is as naught. At this point up goes the cry, but where do I find our horse? Well, in my bailiwick horses are usually to be found standing around in fields, or if the weather is inclement, in what are known as paddocks. What you need to do is wait until nightfall when their human guards will all be tucked up in bed and Creek stealthily to a field or paddock armed with a torch and a bag of buttons. You will use the torch to examine in the engulfing darkness. Such features of your perspective horse as its main fetlocks and withers. Look closely at its musculature. Remember that the horse you choose will be galloping across the land with you astride its back for many years to come. When you've picked a suitable speed, layer trail of bands from the field or paddock, to the gates of your castle, nearly all horses find bands irresistible. And depending on how far the field or paddock is from your castle, your mighty steed should be safe in its new home by break of dawn. It is good practice at this point to pop down to the cellar to check up on the orphan. You are now nearly ready to go marauding and to strike terror into the country folk for miles around. But remember that earlier I mentioned your masked outriders. You will need these accomplices partly for emotional and psychological support, but mainly to help you carry back to your baronial castle the booty from your robberies. opinions differ on how many masks outriders a robber baron needs, but as a rule of thumb to would be an absolute minimum and four or five are preferable. The more masked outriders you have the more saddlebags can be filled with clinking, glistening baubles and coinage. When you have decided on the number you can get the often to make the masks once the coat of arms is finished.

Very occasionally, mask outriders will work on a freelance basis, but it's far more common for them to live in at your castle, and they will expect a share of the booty. Just be on your guard that none among their number gets uppity and clots to usurp you from your baronetcy. Such things have happened of course, so always be prepared to offer small bribes, leftover buns from the bag used to abduct your horse for example, or in an extremity truck that would be used to bits with a broadsword. You should have a collection of these lethal blades displayed up on the wall of the main hall of your baronial castle, get the orphan to polish and buff them regularly. With the bulk of your preparatory work done, all that remains is for you to set out on your first robbery. It is at this stage that many a NEO fight has moral qualms. If until now, you've been a law abiding sort conscientious when it comes to paying your bus fare, and never dropping litter, you may get a bit jittery at the prospect of robbing people. That's why you should begin by robbing another Baron. Later on with some experience under your belt. You'll be able to waylay little bands of peasants and take away all their potatoes as you cackle with evil Glee, but to get you started, there's nothing like another Baron, preferably a robber baron like you're setting out to be. So how do you go about it? First, gather your masked outriders around the table in your baronial Hall. They do not need to be wearing their masks just yet, and you will be able to judge their readiness for the task ahead by studying their faces in the light of the flames roaring from the magnificent fireplace. Have the orphan posted there regularly feeding more logs onto the Blaze. Each Outrider should have been provided with a goblet brimming with a frothy alcoholic potion, gigantic flagons of which are arrayed on a sideboard for whenever a refill is needed, lets them Carew's and wassail for a little while to pick them up, then spread out a Big Mac on the table. This map should show nearby baronial halls with tracks and pathways leading to and from them. You will have made a careful study of the comings and goings of other barons and thus be in a position to know when one of them will be cantering gently along or woodland path or strike his own mighty steed, possibly on his way to an attic nation with a calmly damsel use a question To mark the likely spot for an ambush on the map, and ensure that each of your masks outriders knows how to get their class your goblets together as a mark of camaraderie stamp out of the hole with great determined strides and make a final check that everyone has empty saddlebags ready to be filled with booty. Now is the time to set your horses galloping, and to crash through the trees towards the unsuspecting Baron. Do bear in mind that your victim may have his own masked out riders, and indeed that the gentle cantering of his steed can be deceptive. If he is not just a plain Baron, but a robber baron. He may be setting out to rob someone himself. That is why you and your mask outriders armed to the teeth with the various polished and buffed swords from your baronial Hall. In order to fill your saddlebags with booty, you may have to slash on thrust at the Baron and his mask outriders until they are reduced to a pile of corpses on the woodland path, their blood and gore gleaming and the dappled sunlight shining through the trees. If this is the case, it's worth stripping of them, stripping them of their armor and adding that to your booty. You can take their horses to either by pulling them along on a length of string or by laying a trail of bands back to your castle. However, it is a perturbing fact that this being your first baronial rubbery you and your masked outriders may well come off worse in any slashing and thrusting of lethal blades. If you're worried that it will be your blood and gore gleaming and the dappling sunlight and your mighty steed which follows a trail of bums back to another robber barons castle, you may want to reconsider whether you're making the right career choice. You may decide that you're better suited to being a poster, or a Scrivener, or the Member of Parliament for Sheffield bright side.
