Hello, this is Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. And this is hooting yard on the air. And on Tuesday morning, I was woken by the hectic clanging of the bell through some bibley bid did. I've been dreaming about a monkey as big as a planet, as I sometimes do. Using the botsman technique, I squeezed the sleep out of my brain clambered out of bed and threw my windows wide open. I was rather disconcerted to note that, as Milton put it in book four of Paradise Lost the story cope of heaven, all the elements at least had gone to rack disturbed and turn to him. For Monday had been mild with sunny intervals, and there had been no sign of cosmic Cataclysm. Indeed, I had made a point of watching Danny or coolbet early evening weather forecasts on the BBC, and that always reliable and beautifully well spoken presenter had said nothing at all about rack disturbance, and a tearing in the heavens as far as I could remember. I had, however, taken the precaution of making a copy of his forecast on my Bakelite televisual simulacra mating device, and the steam would have dispersed overnight, making it ready for viewing. So I went into the parlor and depressed the starting knob. I was keen to see if my memory was playing tricks, for there seemed to be no other explanation for the disjuncture between Daniel Corbett's prognostications and the foul reality out with my windows. Why am I waited for the valves to warm up? I recalled that the monkey in my dream had been about as big as the planet Mercury. In earlier dreams, it had been the size of one of those gigantic gas planets you read about. And I wondered if this shrinkage was somehow with something to be welcomed, or indeed feared. It was hard to tell. I sat down on my stool and pulled my crumpled hesi a night shirt tight about my torso. And the semilac are amazing device hissed into life. There as if by magic was Danny or Corbett again, telling me about the weather. dumbfounding me, for as he moved his arms in graceful scooping gestures, like a meteorological ballerina. His words were not those I remembered from yesterday evening. But those of Milton Dan said that the story cope of heaven, all the elements released will go to rack disturbed and torn. And he was right of course, for that was precisely what was happening outside. I had concentrated like mad watching him the day before as I always do. And I was absolutely convinced that what his simulacrum was saying now was not what I had heard then the Bakelite device device could not be at fault for I had had a person from poor luck come to give it an overhaul but a week before, and he had pronounced it to be in full working order was my brain being monkeyed with by the planet sized monkey of my dreams? I watched Danko but again three times, and three times he spoke of RAC. shutting down the device, I changed into my crumpled hessie and outdoor clothing and hurried down the lane to sin bibley big Dibs. The bells still clanged as I staggered into a Pew and prayed as hard as I could for my immortal soul on Tuesday morning.

Today is the 100th anniversary of the great in blockchain. There are countless other in block elements throughout our history, but the one we commemorate today was of a blockly magnitude well above those other in block element. It all started in a commercial laundry on putting Boulevard a man named pin who may or may not have been related Excuse me. A man named Pim, who may or may not have been related to the light Frances Pim, Foreign Secretary from 1982 to 1983 was bundling some towels into a basket when he noticed that one of the towels had been subjected to in blockchain meant a man of piercing eyesight, a bit like Ray moorland in the man with X ray eyes 1963 but obviously not quite as piercing as that pin was able at a glance to divine the cause of the enlargement, and it sent him into a panic. He scampered up the staircase from the laundries a street level and ran the length of putting Boulevard waving the in blocked towel in the air. Thus, micro scopic blockly bits were released into the atmosphere, invisible, but nonetheless block tree. The authorities acted with admirable speed. Pim was carted off to a mysterious Institute hidden behind trees in the countryside, the sort of place that would later become familiar to viewers of the 1960s television series The Avengers. He was placed in isolation and fitted with a metal helmet wired up to bleeping consoles. The in blocked towel was torn from his grasp and sent to another mysterious Institute in the countryside to be analyzed by trained and blockman analysts. Meanwhile, putting Boulevard was cordoned off with what at the time was an entirely new cordoning technique. A controlled explosion destroyed the laundry and its neighboring buildings, and the rubble was taken away by over 50 horse drawn carts and tossed down a pit. It was not a bottomless pit, but the nearest thing to a bottomless pit that could be identified at short notice. When the last bit of rubble was thrown down it, the pit opening was covered with layers of cement, over which a rich loamy soil was scattered, and lupins and primroses were planted there. A similar operation was carried out on the side of the laundry, except but hollyhocks and hyacinth were planted instead of lutens, and primroses. There are compelling reasons for this. Before the day was out, big pumps were moved into position at either end of putting Boulevard and the air was sucked into them, D blocked and pumped back out. Thousands of starlings were viewed to flock over the laundry site and kept their by a magnetic barrier. They were monitored by a team of top ornithologist in a lead line cabin just beyond the boulevard around with your flower bed with dog and planted with geraniums and Wisteria at night for volunteers from Pang Hill orphanage was sent to scurry through the cordoned off area, and as soon as they emerged, were tested for embarkment in a hastily rigged up lab, the floor of which was strewn with lilies and petunias. As we know, none of this hectic activity succeeded in stopping the employment. Not only were the starlings and orphans and top ornithologists in blocked, so to where the gardeners who planted the lupins and primroses and hollyhocks, and higher since in geraniums and Wisteria. Soon, everything was in blocked and I mean absolutely everything, even the stars in their heavens, the outer planets, the gas giants all succumbed to what is rightly called the Great embellishment. And exactly one year later, on the 15th of may 1909. The actor James Mason was born in Huddersfield. Some see this as a coincidence, but those of us who have studied such things, see deeper patterns, patterns, not unlike the embroidered curlicues on the towel that Pim waved as he bashed frantically down putting Boulevard and loose the grating blockland 100 years ago today.

There are some questions that we can answer without hesitation. asked what is your favorite radio program? 100% of sensible people immediately shout, hooting yard on the air of course, with unhinged and hysterical enthusiasm. Similarly, when asked in which school Book Depository, they would prefer to cite a sniper's nest, an overwhelming number of would be assassins reply, the Texas School Book Depository at 411 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas 752023117. Without a doubt, For my part, and in spite of the intervening decades, a question I can answer without even thinking is, what was your favorite Weekly Comic when you were tiny? Well, in my case, it was the hammer of Christ, and within it, the strip I most adored was the one about busta and red board. Each week I followed the adventures of the Kirby pair with my jaw dropped and drool flowing freely down my chin, my heart and pulse rate pounding desperately. It was through busta and red board that I learned to read and I am forever in their debt. They were in many ways and Ill matched fictional pair. Buster was squat hissy and preening. Given the throwing fits, and always a tide and a bright yellow duffle coat and a little pointed wooden cap. He existed on a diet of chocolates with rolls sprat lettuce and untreated milk straight from the goat. We were never given a glimpse of the goat but it was understood that it lived in a field a short walk across the verdant hills from busters house, under its name was Buttercup. Basta had more than one iron pail in which he would collect the milk, one painted red and one unpainted, and a third extra special pail that leaked and that he was always promising to mend but never did. busta had too many teeth crammed inside his mouth, certainly more than a non fictional person would have. And some of them were sharpened into fangs. He liked to sit atop a rotating plinth and spin round and round and round until he was sick. I was always curious as to the engine which rotated the plinth. It bought a distinct rent zenbook resent it bought a distinct resemblance to undersea drilling equipment I had seen either in real life or in catalogs. Although of course, nearly all have Buster and ride bods adventures took place on dry land far from the sea. Buster was once or twice shown to be in possession of a pair of swimming trunks. They were visible in pictures of his open wardrobe alongside a snorkel and an oxygen canisters, but I cannot recall him ever wearing them. Buster had an owl as well as a goat. The owl was also called Buttercup and Buster treated it cruelly often pelting it with the shells of pistachios and Brazil nuts throughout the impossibly long afternoons of his endemic fictional summertime. The owl took it to revenge by regurgitating gobbets of semi digested stone or weasel onto busters pointed wooden cap, which he would then have to rinse clean under the village spigot. Doing so was always a risky business, for lumbering in the vicinity of the village spigot was the village wrestler, a hairy brute, capable of tearing an anvil in half with his great hairy hands. Luckily for buster, the village wrestler was chained to a post next to the village spigot and he was blind. So usually it was possible to skip nimbly out of his reach, even though being squat Buster was not the most nimble of cartoon characters. Indeed, he was not nimble at all. He slouched and he trudged, and he often trailed one of his legs behind him as if he were a lame child. But this was just rough galaxy. Buster pretended to be lame to doodle small coinage from shopkeepers and the ground staff at the aerodrome, but most of them were wise to his tricks. in quite a few stories, Buster and rad both moved around the aerodrome trying to enter the hangars, but they were invariably stymied by one circumstance or another, be the weather or early closing, or an attack of killer bees or a rusty padlock.

Frank Key  14:57
Once they were about to step into an unknown guarded an unlocked hangar at the aerodrome, when they were surprised by the ghost of Sylvia Townsend Warner, and fled screaming into the hills. Other literary phantoms haunted the comic strip from time to time for differing narrative purposes, and not always at the aerodrome. The Ghost of Emily Dickinson for example, hovers in midair outside the village shampoo list in several frames of a particularly exciting adventure, in which a toggle on busters duffle coat is discovered to be a smooth round fragment from the tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. Basta hires, Buster hires a broom to fight off the ancient Egyptian ghouls who come to reclaim the pharaohs toggle. the hiring of brooms, sweeping brushes, dusters, squeegees rags and other cleaning materials. It's one of busters hobbies, along with bell ringing, stamp collecting, making fluted paper cupcake cases. pelting his owl with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts. First World War battle reenactments, tongue twisters, snakes and ladders playing songs from the fort modular Memorial dump LP on the glockenspiel, churning up froth in a pile, bandage sculpture, tic tac tacky talk, driving nails into mud idols subu to table football, poop tack flat attack with ping pong, hopping about flapping his arms conjuring tricks, removing splinters from caches, cardboard appreciation, amateur dramatics pencil sharpening, scattering pins all over the place, bowling bowls and dishes and running a flea circus. I thought of Buster rather than rad board as a role model. Buster had non colons Erlang as filthy temper already wit and peevishness. He was in seussian when one of his lungs collapsed. The smoke Did you tines he sometimes wore his pointed wooden cap at a jaunty angle. He could hold his breath underwater for several very very tense minutes. He rattled about in a fantastic old jalopy. He had ambitions to be a Badri on an extensive system of canals. It was a dab hand with a banjo and not in a musical sense. Once he felled the blind Bruce really Dressler with a simple flick of his duffle coat cuff, and afterwards had the grace to polish the blind brute frilly dresses chain with a hired rag and his own homemade swore fieger. He dazzled at cocktail parties. He spat upon hissing cold, he tiptoed from rooms with a swish of elegance. He was off on a frolic of his own. rad board, by contrast, was a somewhat colorless character. Recently, I learned that a complete set of the hammer of Christ bound in the height of a cloven hooved beast of the barnyard, and containing all the adventures of busta and redboard will be for sale at an auction to be held the dilapidated Custom House by the harbor steps in the stinking seaside resort where I usually spend my holidays. I am by no stretch of the imagination, an experienced auction gala, and I have no idea how to make a bed. Do I nod or raise an eyebrow or hold up a pencil or flail my arms around? I do not want to cut an idiotic figure. But nor do I want to miss the chance to get my hands on such a treasure. It's a quandary to be sure I

Frank Key  19:01
haven't given it much thought I've decided to take my lead from Buster himself. In one episode of this most marvelous of comic strips. He goes to an auction at a Custom House not unlike the auction at the Custom House I plan to attend. And when the lot he covets, comes up he sneaked outside and through an aperture pumps into the auction room a fast acting nerve gas or maybe it's just any gas I can't quite remember. I suppose that something I have to check before carrying out minder farriers plan. If I pump the wrong sort of gas through an aperture who knows what might happen? The problem is that just as I'm ignorant of bidding behavior auctions, I haven't got a clue about gases. I know there are lots of different kinds of gas and that they act differently upon the people gathered in a room into which one or other of them is pumped through an aperture. But how am I to go picking my gas is an absolute mystery. And so for now, it shall remain for there is much that Trumps gas research in my daily round. And right now I feel as I often do the call of the monkey and I must pick nits out of my head and shovel bananas down my throat and swing from large to Sycamore in my large and Sycamore enclosure. Beyond the back garden by the railway lines were hooting freight trains Thunder along the track carrying vast loads of pig iron to pig iron town, where I have never been and will never go for it is far far away and built entirely from pig iron.

Last week, we held a funeral service for the parish Wolf, although none of us is sure if it's really dead, it's howling has not been heard for 12 years though, and under our laws. a death certificate can be issued for a missing wolf. After just five years. The general feeling in the parish was summed up by the Sexton, in a notice nailed Luther fashion to the door of the church. Even in the absence of a corpse it would be for the good of the parish. If obstacles we are if obsequies were held. This was the gist of his notice. Like it was couched in the mighty prose he deployed even when writing nature notes for the parish newsletter, and he did not on any account, use the word closure. One reason the Sexton is so persuasive is that his appearance and bearing a strangely reminiscent of the actor James Robertson Justice 1907 to 1975. This is no accident. Over the years the Sexton has worked hard to imitate the booming voice, and he has undergone cosmetic surgery, the better to ape the appearance of the man who were not appearing in films kept busy as a naturalist racing driver and falconry expert. Before dawn on the morning of the folk funeral, there was a teeming downpour. The rain had ceased by the time we gathered in the churchyard, but the parkton trees were drenched, water droplets dripping from the tiny gray spongy bands, each bands like the brain of our home monk aeolus, an extraordinary number of puddles had formed on the paths, and there are many paths converging on some bibley bibs, for it is the only church four miles around all others having been smashed a ruination by the sextons predecessor, single handedly. He was twice the size of the president incumbent, a titan among sextons and a brute and the parish had been much quieter since he will sit away and was carted off to a home for the wilted. No duck splashed in the puddles for word had not yet reached them that the perish wolf was dead, or at least thought to be dead, and no duck dead come near for fear of being torn a bit. I had been asked to read the obsequies and had prepared what I thought was a pretty speech. I have a weakness for alliteration, and made use of lots of W words, describing the parish wolf was winsome, and windswept and waterlogged and wirey and Wobegon and witless. There was little truth in any of this for the signal fact about the parish wolf was that it was for the most part invisible came the fat guru, the village bus driver, claimed to have seen it crossing the road once or twice, and the preposterous tabloid astrology Jonathan caner, who wants spent a week holed up in old mob brimstone Bed and Breakfast establishment said that said that the wolf paid him nocturnal visits in his dingy room. But few of us gave these tales any credence. Yet, despite remaining unseen the wolf was or had been a mighty presence in our parish. And I felt it deserved a memorable send off with all those w words, even if what I said was inaccurate. Our Vicar had been abducted by a caterer of Rogue tandis and was tied up in a turret somewhere. So the Sexton took charge of the service. When it came, my turn to speak notice Sooner had I propped my notepad on the lectern and cleared my throat. The neck came a bellowing of cows from the fields joining the church. My words were drowned out. The cows bowed all day and all night and into the next day for labor, mad old farmer frack cows. And there are hundreds of them massive and ungainly and bellowing, the funeral broke up in disarray, and we repaired to a hangar at the village airfield, and we ate cake and macadamia nuts and under the shadow gigantic propellers. And when we emerged, look, Doc populated the puddles, the parish wolf was dead and gone.

That's that's the end of this week's show. I don't think I've got time to reveal anything else. I could tell you a bit about what I could tell you a bit about going to the visit the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org, where you will find it completely updated since last December. There are reasons for this, which I won't go into here. But the point is that even though it hasn't been updated for months, there's so much material there, you could spend months or years reading it all. I recommend either starting at the end, and working your way backwards in time, or going right to the beginning and working your way forward in time. The current website began in 12 years ago in 2007. And prior to that, there was a there was a website, which was a slightly different format. And that ran from 2003 to 2006. And all of that is available in an archive. So you could spend literally years reading all the stuff that's there if you so wish, and I will be updating it soon. I just have to have another couple of injections in one of my eyes. Both of my eyes will several injections to improve my vision somewhat, because it's still catastrophically bad. But yes, maybe you can you can read that. And I'll be coming back here next week. Anyway, to read further stuff to you. Everything I read this week was from the paperback book, gravitas, punk, telio, rectitude and Pipi bags. And if you'd like to buy your own copy of that book, you can find you can find how to do so on the website. Look down the kind of right hand side of your screen. So that's it for this week. I hope you've had a pleasurable time. Thanks as ever to john for engineering. And I'll be back next week with more guff from the yard. Bye bye.
