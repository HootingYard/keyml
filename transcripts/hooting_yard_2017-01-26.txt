Good evening pod pickers, this is Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM with hosting yard on the air. The other day, I was woken from a much needed nap by a squeak. I identified it instantly as the script of a screech owl, for I'm ever alert to occurrences of an ornithological kidney appeared out of the window and spotted the owl perched on a picket fence. I pranced outside went straight, to move to the owl punched my fist and thumped it. And what I supposed was its solar plexus. The owl toppled from the fence looking mightily disconcerted. As soon as it hit the ground, it righted itself unfold its wings and flew away. I watched until it had vanished in the blue Imperium, which in truth was gray and overcast rather than blue, but empyrion nevertheless, and then I returned indoors to resume my nap. The next day, I answered a knock at the door to be confronted by a gangly beanpole, wearing some sort of peaked cap with glittering metal insignia pinned to it. interrogative would you be Mr. Key? he said. Same Wah, I replied foolishly, for I was in foolish spirits. interrogative he said again, yesterday. Did you thump an owl knocking it from its perch? I did. I said. It was a screech owl and it scraped woke me from a much needed nap. interrogative he said yet again? And this time I interrupted him. Why do you keep saying interrupt in interrogative interrogative don't get snippy with me. Mr. Key, just answer my questions. interrogative Are you aware that the thumping of owls is in contravention of the municipal bylaws regarding conduct towards and or in the presence of owls? What I said so he repeated himself. So I did too. And he was about to repeat himself. When I flicked his face. A moth of smokers popped up. I happened to be holding and told him to go away. This was a mistake. He punched his fist and thumped me in the solar plexus. When I was able to breathe again, he helped me inside and we sat facing each other at the breakfast table. A word of advice he said, it's never a good idea to try to stymie the activities of a senior officer of the Civic, our squad, going about his lawful business, as you have learned. Now, let there be no more nonsense from you. I am invested with powers more draconian, more merciless than you could imagine in your wildest and most sweat drenched pillow gnawing nightmares. Dad was all I could say for I was still winded. Now. You've admitted to thumping an owl. I have it down on my pocket cassette recorder. Your nap is of no concern to us, by the way. by us. I mean myself and the screech owl you thumped vo not present. I can assure you that it can hear every word you say for screech owls are blessed with a tremendously good sense of hearing. I offer that tip in case you reminded to say something dis obliging about the owl when you recover the power of speech. It will be listening carefully to everything you say for several months until that is you have made complete restitution for your thumping. Red are gasped. Precisely, he said restitution every day. For the next several months. You will fill this sack at which he whacked a large burlap sack up on the table with insects, reptiles, small mammals, such as bats and mice and small birds such as wrens and hummingbirds. You will deliver the sack filter brain to the brim every morning at 6am on the.to your neighborhood civic owl squad drop in center. Why betide you if you fail to comply?

Frank Key  05:15
I wondered for a moment of what that whoa might consist, but decided it was better for my nervous equilibrium not to ask. Thank you for your cooperation, said the gangly been Paul. I will see myself out. And I'm sure you don't mind me helping myself to one of your smokers popped out. I did mind but what could I do? The next day after filling the sack to the brim with insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice, and small birds, such as rains and hummingbirds and delivering it to the drop in center. I returned home exhausted and took a much needed nap. I was woken by a how I identified it instantly as the howl of a howler monkey for I'm ever alert to occurrences of a simian kidney.

Pato vas, I think I have those words given as the answer to a question, but I didn't hear the question due to the tremendous racket of a German improvising on par marching band, which appeared from around the corner, just as the question was posed. At least I assume a question was put and drowned out by the den. Otherwise, that pot or vase I think, makes little or no sense. In any case, I look wildly around to see what Patil vas was being spoken of. Granted, it was none of my business. I had merely eavesdropped upon somebody else's conversation. But my interest is always piqued by pottery. Well, not always. Sometimes I yawn in the presence of ceramics, a yawn so wide and prolonged that I begin to draw. Fortunately, I always carry an embroidered napkin with me with which to mop any unseemly dribbling from my kin. The embroidery on my napkins? That's right napkins plural for I have quite a collection was stitched by a Crone in a garden for Hamlet hidden somewhere in the blue forgotten hills. I cannot recall the circumstances in which I stumbled upon her noise somewhat. Other than that, I was on an organized walking tour at the time. The tour was arranged by an agency specializing in walking tours of hilly areas, places with lots of humps and bumps to be negotiated. This agency had its head office situated inappropriately on a very flat and level High Street in a market town. Immediately in front of its doorway. No more than two or three paces as accomplished by average human adult leg length was a cement horse trough. When I visited the agency, a horse with gobbling water from the trough. It was a startlingly elegant horse. I patted its fetlocks what I supposed where it's fetlocks, but I ought to confess that my knowledge of equine anatomy is skimpy. I paid little attention when we were taught this topic by Dr. Gabbert s in the village schoolroom, all those years ago. Dr. Gabbert has claimed to be an expert on the subject of horses, as well as astronomy, Latin Pig Latin pudding recipes, the higher mathematics disko polar geography for flight patterns of uncommon birds shove hype, honey, dust, and many another topic. He was a curiously bloated figure who looks as if he'd been dragged from the sea after drowning several months ago. But the village where I grew up, was nowhere near the sea. I did not see it until I was the age of Christ at His crucifixion. I was stunned. There I stood on my 33rd birthday. Upon the beach of ember gazing at that vast wax sloshing expanse, it will be no exaggeration to say that the sight of it befuddled my brain, so much so that I quickly retreated to the dilapidated seaside boarding house where I have taken a room and I shot myself in that room and remain there for weeks. There was on the window sill of that room, a pot or vase I think, holding a splurge of lupins freshly cut when I arrived, and slowly shriveling and dying as the days passed, as all of us do, as the years pass.

Drink to me, Ben Johnson to see Leah. I am not Celia. She's long dead, as is a rare Ben Johnson, but I thought I'd give it a go. Usually, of course we drink with our mouths, but I'm particularly well placed to drink with my eyes. Regular listeners will know that I've been undergoing a series of injections of a needle directly into my eyeballs. My reasoning is that consequent upon this treatment, I have several holes in a dry through which I might imbibe liquid. For my first attempt at being Celia as it were, I propped up on the mantle piece a picture of Ben Johnson. This was a mezzotint tempted by the noted mezzotint test Rex tent. I would try to keep my eyes fixed upon this as I drank. I then Excuse me, I then opened a can of sculpture, and poured the contents into a tumbler. Transferring this to my eyes was not as simple as I had imagined. I found I had to tilt my head back until I was gazing at the ceiling, rather than Ben Johnson. I solved this problem by putting down the tumbler, taking the mezzotint from the mantelpiece and affixing it to the ceiling with a couple of blobs of a proprietary brand of rubber cement. I then picked up the tumbler again, tilted my head back, gazed adoringly at the mezzotint countenance of Ben Johnson, and poured a modicum of sculpture first into one eye, then the other. To my dismay, not a drop of liquid entered either I, it just ran down my face, so that I resembled the startlingly Angular woman in that Picasso painting, though not quite so Angular, nor so girly, of course. drying my face with a nearby tea towel, I determined upon a different approach. I'd jettison the tumbler removed Ben Johnson from the ceiling and replaced him on the mantle piece. I then opened a second can of sculpture, and decocted part of the content into a perfume bottle Atomizer Air bound invention. I reasoned that spraying the squelch at my eyes would provide greater force than namby pamby pouring and the liquid would be impelled through the holes in my eyes. gazing once more at a rare Ben Johnson, I truly scrunch the air bulb in my manly fist. Alas, this proved no more effective than pouring the squelch Joe just ran down my face the same as before, I tossed the perfume bottle Atomizer Air bulb invention under the sink, mopped my face with the tea towel and hit upon a third approach. Clearly, the spray was too weedy. What I needed to do was to force a jet of squelch Oh through a hose pipe at high velocity. This would surely force the liquid through the several pinprick holes in my eyes. listener. It did not. I spent hours designing and constructing a contraption comprising a length of rubber hose pipe, a large plastic canister, and electric motor, some valves and nozzles and umpteen cans of sculpture. all I got for my troubles was a terrific headache, awful pain in my eyes and vision temporarily Paid even more than usual. Having had a long lie down in a darkened room, I made one last desperate attempt to drink squelched Joe to Ben Johnson only with mine eyes. This time, I simply filled out a bucket with the contents of yet more cans of the remarkably fizzy fizzy drink, and plunged my head into it. I shoved cokes into my ears, held my nose between thumb and forefinger and kept my mouth shut. Eventually, I had to remove my head from the bucket and slammed on the floor, panting for breath, or I would have died. It was with disbelief that I realized I have not managed to ingest a single drop of squelch Whoa, through my eyes. I mentioned all this to the consultant my next appointment at the Eye Hospital. She gave me a funny look, the input of which I could not quite decipher and said this is the key. Let me try to explain something to you. It's really a very simple matter.

Frank Key  16:17
Excuse me, Mr. Key. Let me try to explain something to you. It's really a very simple matter. Such a small child should have no difficulty grasping it. When we plunger needle directly into one of your eyeballs during your regular appointments here. The needle is astonishingly thin and the resultant how and the resultant hole in your eyeball is microscopically tiny. so tiny. It is even tinier than Tinie Tempah. It is such a tiny hole, that it closes up and sealed completely within a very short time after the injection. Almost certainly before you have even left the hospital grounds. I'm afraid there is no chance whatsoever. Have you drinking the Ben Johnson only with thine eyes. This gave me pause for thought and I became dejected. But my dejection did not last long. As I promised half blind out of the hospital. It came to me in a flash that being Celia did not mean I had to be Ben Johnson's Celia. I could be another Celia entirely. I could be Celia Johnson in brief encounter. I bent down, plucked a piece of grit from the ground and shoved into my eye. Then I sashayed off to the railway station, went into the tea room and waited for someone to come up to me saying, Can I help you? Please let me look, I happen to be a doctor.

And yes, recommended to all web browsers hooting yard. Anyway, here's another piece. I was at one day observing birds. When I saw what I considered to be a particularly Sparky little clover. I said as much to my walking companion. Don't see the bird woman. Book doll. See, I said pointing. It's that not a Sparky pullover. I pronounced clover to rhyme with the plant clover. I think you will find his dulcie the bird woman whose every utterance was a hiss that it is pronounced plover To run with the trade of Glover, a man who makes gloves, but be that as it may, what could possibly lead you to dub it Sparky? It is not shooting for sparks. And if it were, I think the both of us would be mightily disconcerted. I was using the word Sparky as father Hopkins deployed it in his juvenile verse drama flow florists in Italy, I said, where he writes such spider's web he ties across his site in certain ellipses, guilds with some Sparky fancies blinding night, where Sparky is a synonym for lively or vivacious. It is in the same sense it was used as the name of a weekly children's comic I used occasionally to read when I was a taught a different since then, to the spark translated from the Russian iscrap, which was no children's comic, but an organ of Bolshevik propaganda in pre revolutionary Russia, his dulcy, who was surprisingly erudite in many matters, not relating directly to birds. I wouldn't know about that, I said, I am woefully ignorant of Bolshevism. We were standing having pools to take in the plover in a on a path winding alongside an estuary scattered here and there beside the path where the stumps of unknown trees don't see the bird woman sat down on one and took from her bag and greaseproof paper package containing a sandwich. Of course, she hissed between manages a robot plover might in this sparks had something gone awry with it to wiring, but only a fool would build such a robot. I nodded. I had not brought any sandwiches with me, for I was feckless. I have to say, continue to dulcie that your plover seems neither more nor less lively and vivacious than any other plover nor indeed than any other wading bird. It is Mary going about his business in the shallows at the edge of the estuary. It is not my plover, I protested. She fixed me with an older somehow menacing Look, she swallowed the last of her sandwich. Are you quite sure of that? She hissed. It is merely a plover I spotted and described this Sparky. I said, Why would I lay any further claim to it? doll See, the bird woman chuckled to herself, then hist it was said of both Rudolf Steiner and que en lie, but they seem to admit flashes of mysterious light. Perhaps you will, Sparky plava to is such a marvel. Look. was already looking at the plover and sure enough, I suddenly cast forth a flash of glittering effulgence a brilliant radiance that would have blinded me had not turned my head away and shut my eyes. When I opened them again. I saw that dulcy had put on a pair of sunglasses and was eating a plum.

Frank Key  23:23
That is a very interesting bird. She hissed. You right to pointed out it alone among all the other plovers and dot rolls and wading birds. Here, take this net and bag your Sparky plover and take it home with you. It will not resist it. Is your bird familiar? I had no idea what she was talking about. But as if in a dream, I took the natural drawn out of her Pipi bag, and I scampered off toward the shoreline toward the plover. Was it really mine? Was it really my familia? As I as I closed upon it, fanning out the net, it again shot for a flash of incandescent light. And in that moment, it seemed I and the bird and the light. Were all one. Was it a moment, or was it a year? A century a millennium? I could not tell. But when the mic faded, I dug my short stubby beard into the sand and pulled out a juicy worm and as I guzzle it down, I looked up and saw sitting on the stump of an unknown Cree, a woman. She stood up hoisted a bag over her shoulder, and before walking away, she kept a plump stone at me. It missed me by a whisker

Frank Key  25:33
That was a piece from our series of Plum based pros, which we've been following this year. And to end this week's show because I haven't got long left that old favorite further science book 20 by Norman Davis, published in 2001. Here is the section on cold plant attribute. One that cold plant attributes include great scent, vanilla, poison berries, from East Asia, used for water dividing. Bristol, crocus, snowdrops winter, Jasmine, Iris, Rhododendron, Heather cherry, peach, gumming fine, gaudy blossom nuts and bolts. waxy, wheat rust, long, arching any soil, silvery Calkins more vigorous than anti lime short life. Not set seed, north facing walls, peeling colored bark, glossy colored foliage, canes, smooth bamboo, rough palms, suckers, etc.

Frank Key  27:26
So that's the end of this week shooting out on the air. Now you know all you need to know about cold plant attributes. I hope you've memorized those words and will be able to recite them yourself. I will be back next week with more pros. Some of it will be regarding plums. Bye bye.

Life's like that isn't it? me the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers and wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
