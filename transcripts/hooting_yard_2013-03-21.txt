Good evening, this is Frank K. And this is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. JOHN, the engineer and I were just saying that we didn't know that ireenie handle was on resonance, but I'm sure that was her voice just you heard just now. We'll have to look about in the studio to see if she's here. Dobson had this to say about mythic vapors. I can date my fanatical interest in mythic vapors quite precisely. There was an awesome during my childhood when my parents took to sending me at the first hint of daylight on a morning errand to fetch eggs from a distant farm. There had been a falling out with the nearby egg man, for reasons unclear to me. I was sent out of the room on the last occasion he called and heard muffled, indecipherable shouting, some thumps, and the slamming of the door. The next day, I was roused at dawn and told to put on my Wellington boots and head off across the field, following a hand drawn map pressed into my hands by papaya. The map showed our hovel, and a dotted line with compass points and a few notable features, such as a badger sanctuary, and a botsman mask. And at the end of the dotted line, an egg representing the distant farm, I would have had to be a peculiarly dim witted child not to be able to make my way there and back by mid afternoon. But what papar emitted from the map deliberately or otherwise, was loathsome marsh. This I had to splash through in my Wellington's twice a day until months later, there was a rapprochement with the egg man. In spite of it to load sadness, I grew to love loads to marsh. I was particularly fond of the mythic vapors, which hung over it, morning and afternoon, a shroud of evil mist, in which I fancied sprites and goblins, cavorting and cutting capers. The noxious Pong did not bother me, for I soon learned to plug my nostrils with cotton wall. Years later, I had the pleasure of meeting my Fitbit vapor scientist who was making a special study of lonesome marsh. One day he took me to his laboratory, where I spent a happy afternoon poring over his baffling array of instruments and equipment. While he explained his project to me. He to it seemed he was convinced that the mythic vapors of reload some Marsh serve to half conceal various sprites and goblins. He was, he said, trying to isolate them, he would go down to the marsh at daybreak, as I had done all those years ago, and scan the magnetic vapors with a magnetic vapor scanner of his own design. He then captured a sample of the morphic vapors in a glass holder it vent plugged with a simple cork from a wine bottle and brought it back to the barkery for analysis. Thus far, he admitted he had no conclusive results to report, but I could tell from the Mad gleam in his eyes, that the prophetic vapors of loathsome Marsh had quite unhinged him and that his life thereafter would be devoted to them. I have not been able to trace the out of print pamphlet by Dobson from which this passage is taken. It appears in an anthology and titled The bumper book of mythic vapors for boys and girls. The Edit tricks of which one prudence foxglove provides no sources for any of the 437 texts she cobbled together. There is a distinct possibility that she may have written the whole thing herself, and attributed the separate pieces to writers both real and invented. I cannot be bothered to check on the others. But alongside Dobson, we have passages on my Fitbit vapors, purportedly by Rudyard Kipling, Ford Madox Ford, Dorothy Parker and Anthony Burgess. certain other pieces are credited to unknown authors who are probably figments of prudence, foxgloves imagination, such as Tex beard, Gladiolus frog mentor and Jeanette Winterson. maddeningly, however the passage I have quoted certainly reads like Dobson,

I had it analyzed by an expert in textual authentication methods at the University of ik on the act, who gave it a rating of 93% on his own scale. He did not explain the scale to me, but there was something very persuasive about the expression on his large flat for Lord face when he reported his findings. Against that he ran off at inhuman speed. As soon as I handed over the cash payment he demanded. So the jury is still out. One Avenue we might prance along is to attempt to identify the mythic vapor scientist Dobson or prudence foxglove mentioned. If we can find a trace of him elsewhere in the pamphlet his work, this would I think, settle the matter. Fortunately, hothead young Dobson is to Ted CAC has embarked upon precisely this approach, so I don't have to, from his current location in a sink of advice and debauchery, somewhere in the hinterland of tan Tara beam, Ted Kak wrote to me a holy their key. Let me tell you what I have on my desk right now, to my right, a pile of Dobson pamphlet, both originals and illegal photocopies. To my left the 16 volumes of the new standard Biographical Dictionary of mythic vapor scientist, Revised Edition. And do you know what I'm doing? When I'm not canoodling? With floozies and glugging vast quantities of 90% proof best alien toxic and and keeping it all night and card games of spite? I have been diligently cross referencing the two piles. Sooner or later, I'm going to be able to match up a name from the dictionary with a person mentioned in a pamphlet. Then my fame among Dobson this will be as glorious and eternal as the star on Raymond resells forehead. The rest of you may as well Pack your bags and slink off to wherever pathetic fails. Dobson is slink off to splashing about helplessly and load the marsh most likely. Toodle Pip. Yours, Ted Kak. If Ted cat does succeed in his research, I might well go slinking off as he suggests, but in order to do so, I would have to know the location of loads to Marsh and that too, is a mystery.

listeners will be familiar with the plucky fascist tot tiny Enid, but I've only recently learned of the existence of her cousin, and sometime playmate Erie, Mavis Erie, Mavis spent much of her time loitering in a bomb mucking about with length of string and rotting fruit and pliers. She is said to have had an affinity with jack doors. Though it is not clear how this manifested itself. eerie she may have been, but she did not have the power of flight. And her speaking voice was more akin to the matter than the core. Indeed, one of the area's things about eerie Mavis was her constant, incomprehensible and somehow menacing muttering, which began as soon as she woke from sleep on her straw palette in the barn, and continued all bloody day, until eventually exhaustion, she flung herself back on the palate and the land of nod. Even then, she was known to matter in her sleep. You could trust Irie Mavis with a box of matches. She showed no signs of Pyromania and indeed could be counted on the Dow's any conflagrations which might erupt in the farmyard. She never seemed to be far from a spigot and showed both delicacy and determination when handling a host pipe. She was not a musical top, the top muttering pay to any ambitions she may have had as a songstress, but could be spell bound by the sound of electric guitars played in the screeching heavy metal style, and also by the softer toots of the piccolo. When so spellbound, she would drop her string and fruit and pliers and stand Stockstill close by a spigot in her slightly lopsided way and shut her eyes and levitate an inch or so off the ground. Her muttering did not entirely cease at such times, but it became quieter. Slight lopsidedness had no apparent physical cause. She did not unlike her cousin, tiny Enid have a clubfoot. She wore no corrective boot. Passing farmyard. Adults would occasionally try to straighten her up by means of gentle coaxing to no avail. In a tape recorded interview, conducted decades later, when she had become a Crone, Aaron Mavis revealed that she had always stood bolt upright, and it was the farmyard itself, that was a lopsided last. It had by then long been covered by concrete, and no land surveyor could attest to the truth of her claim. A double biography of Erie, Mavis and tiny Enid is long overdue. There is one in the works from the pen of pebble head. But many obstacles lie in his path. Not least the fact that each time he completes a page. No sooner has it rolled off his typewriter than it is snatched, snatched and borne away in the beak of adrak door up into the blue Alpine skies, irretrievable, irretrievable, lost, lost, lost.

There'll be more about the indefatigable paper back east pebble and later in the show. But pebble had of course, great at writing potboilers, and I thought I'd read a potboiler of my own. This is called excuse me, toward the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits. These are the voyages of the starship corrugated cardboard. It's five year mission to seek out somewhere in the illimitable vastness of space, the Planet of the crumpled Jesuit. This is a needle in a haystack stuff. Unless you have boldly gone across the universe yourself aboard one of the other starships, you really can have no idea just what a pallava it is. So some sympathy, please. When I was called into starship command, four and a half years ago, all I knew was that I was going to be made captain of a mission. What I did not know was the nature of that mission. I was excited for this was to be my first Captain See, I had plenty of experience as a boson and a Crow's Nester on both ships and starships. I had done the so called milk round, delivering bottles of milk to far flung space colonies, such as New j week, and far distant new isle of muck. I had served my time playing between the dismal little planetoids of galaxy 14, eradicating the bind weed and setting up diversity outreach initiatives. I had even been to the furthest and most distant planet of all, the one with the weird Voodoo Rastafarian belief system and giant cyclopean, turtles and sweet smelling Marsh gas. But none of these voyages had prepared me for the mission to find somewhere in the illimitable vastness of space, the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits. The story goes that several hundred years ago, on Omnia when a gang of Jesuits grew tired Have a three ways and set out in a second hand spaceship to find a deserted planet. There, they would establish a Jesuit ethical paradise. If one could imagine such a thing they quite clearly did. But what they cannot have foreseen was their gradual crumpling, which began shortly after they landed on their distant world, and proceeded a pace with ghastly consequences. Now, every single Jesuit on the planet was a picture of almost unimaginable crumbled. paradise it might have been better paradise King with crumpling. This much we know from radio report picked up by a space scooter. The news cause something of a hubbub when it reached Earth. certain members of the interplanetary council were livid, others more sanguine, but they're livid ones one, but the livid ones won the day. And it was they who insisted on sending a mission to find the planet. Because of the space scooters onboard radio scrambling system. It was an unfathomable mystery from where the Stark and crumpled messages had been sent. I did ask starship command what I was meant to do after I found the planet and was given an envelope marked further instructions to be opened only after the Planet of the crumble. Jesuit has been located and that location confirmed I kept the envelope tucked into a pocket of my starship captains smock it's a fine smoke modeled on the ones worn by 19th century peasants in rustic English backwaters. rustic backwaters is as good a description as any of the many and various worlds we have visited during the last four and a half years. We have seen incredible things, most of them involving potatoes, hay, and spices straw, but to date, we have not encountered a crumpled, Jesuit and crumpled ones yes on certain

other planets are listed which I maintain in my logbook. Most planets after all, or at least most of the ones that support life, have a Jesuit as they have an alderman and a town crier and a haberdasher, and a man whose job it is to club seals. My crew and I have gained deep and penetrating insight into the basic patterns of the known universe. And we have taken tea with the Voodoo Rastafarians of that most distant of all planets. It was our first port of call. Knowing that some members of my crew would suffer from terrible homesickness, I decided to ease their sufferings by the simple expedient of so arranging things that for the bulk of our voyage, we would be heading towards Earth, in a roundabout way, of course, but generally with the starships nose cone pointing towards home. As a result of my captain he wisdom morale has been high, where the average starship voyage is a purgatory of latitude grumpiness with longing and weeping. The corrugated cardboard is a drunken ship with Piccolo recitals and flower arranging contest and jousting tournament and games of quotes and monkey diverted elements and all sorts of other recreations. On Sundays I promise and skip about with a fairy wand. The only tears are tears of happiness. Yet for all that there is mounting tension. With only six months before our scheduled landing at starship command HQ at Clacton on sea. We are all too aware that we're in danger of failure. There has been no sign of anything even resembling the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits. Our daily prayers are not helping, even though we save them in Latin and where vestment the envelope in my pocket remains an open. I know I cannot ask for more time. For one thing the fuel will run out. Also, the emergency boosters packed up after we had to make a quick getaway for my plan is in Sector nine, which turned out to be inhabited entirely by starving be found and ferocious, giant space donkeys The chief engineer, a Dewar Scott, like all good starship chief engineers, has been faffing about with the boosters day in, day out.

Frank Key  20:17
Excuse me, the trigger engineer. A duel Scott, like all good starship chief engineers has been faffing about with the boosters day in day out, but they still make a horrible creaking noise and sputter out. Or perhaps it's the chief engineer who makes the creaking noise, noise. He might be more elderly than I had been led to believe. Or the space time continuum might be playing tricks on us. I have heard rumors of such things. But we must keep our Packers up. Today is the feast day of St. Ignatius of Loyola. We shall continue on our voyage aboard the starship corrugated cardboard with hope in our hearts. So we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the gravitational field of the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits.

I said we would return to pebble head. And so we do. The stupid milk is the first in a new series of blockbuster paperback potboilers by pebble head. The threads linking the projected series of a dozen books of the protagonist, Tip Top Secret Agent, jugs, soup tin, and the titles, each of which is a translation from the wealth of a near anagram of the name of a 20th century American female avant garde choreographer. The use of such an Olympian constraint is something of a departure of a pebble head, and we can perhaps see the influence of his new literary agent, international woman of mystery Primrose dent. Frau dent has long conducted her mysterious affairs according to dazzlingly complicated rules derived ultimately from the kinds of constraints employed by the writers of the repo. So in explicable law, her doings that few can work out what it is she actually does, let alone the constraints she applies. All we can say for certain is that many, if not most of her enigmatic schemes involve the use of Fuller's Earth, Coddington lenses and Leyden jars. Certainly, all of these materials have appeared in varying quantities in the grounds of pebble head, so called chalet Oh pros since he was taken under the wing of Primrose dent, and it is surely no accident that in his very first adventure, Tip Top Secret Agent drug soup tin is called upon to fall a dastardly plot conceived by a criminal maniac whose chief weapons are given as follows jars, Coddington, Earth and laden lenses. Pages 46 to 49. supergene himself is a curiously bashful hero for a pebble head book. He is winsome, distracted and pale, with impossibly dainty hand and girly eyelashes. on page nine, we learned that he would not say boo to a goose, and not long afterwards, page 12 he indeed encounters a goose on a canal towpath at signally failed to say boo to it, instead skipping away to hide behind a splurge of lupins until the goose has gone away. The goose reappears Incidentally, on page 149, marching at the head of a gaggle of its fellows honking in a thrilling scene which ends with the criminal maniac toppling into a CRO vath. The stupid milk of the title is goatee milk into which has been injected a serum which renders stupid anybody who drinks it as ever with pebble head. A great deal of research has got into the book and he provides a recipe for the serum which any of us could whipped up in a lab in five minutes. For the purposes of this review, I did just that, then injected the resulting serum into a carton of goat's milk and fed it to several guinea pigs, including a guinea pig, a stray cat, a guide dog, and leaf cutter and, and the Labour Party MP David Lammy. I can confirm that pebble hood certainly seems to know his stuff. But luckily, I am not a criminal maniac. So I have not like drug soup tins pho in the book, concocted millions of gallons of the stupid milk and poured it into important reservoirs around the globe. On a scale of fabulous I would deem this blockbuster to be tremendously fab. It has its faults, of course, particularly in pebble heads portrayed of the goose, which is unlike any goose one might meet in the real world. Indeed, I'm not convinced the author knows exactly what a goose is. But we've been here before with pebble head for all the diligence of his research and fact checking in non ornithological matters.

Frank Key  26:20
He seems to have a blind spot when it comes to birds. Who can forget the tiny airborne ostriches, which mark the otherwise excellent potboiler tiny airborne ostriches, or the talking limit in the talking limit. Interestingly, that limit in the talking minutes speaks Welsh. It might be worth going back to the book to say if anything it says is a near anagram of the name of a 20th century American female avant garde choreographer, then we might be able to make an educated guess the forthcoming further Adventures of Tip Top Secret Agent drugs to Putin.
