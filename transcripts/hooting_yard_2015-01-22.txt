Right resonance 104 point four FM, the art of listening.

Good evening pickers, this is putting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. cast your mind back three weeks. Three weeks ago today was New Year's Day, first of January. And this is what I wrote on New Year's Day. It seems to me that hooting yard ought to have an overarching theme for the new year, a program or project to act as a spur to my puny and often idle brain pans. The 2012 Hp elocution project, in which I attempted to write 1000 words a day on subjects of which I knew nothing was actually worked very well kept it going until mid November. But similar schemes in 2013, I tried to do something based on diaries. And in 2014, I tried to do something based on birds, both of them petered out fairly rapidly. What then, for 2015, I've been wondering for quite some time whether I want to cobble together an encyclopedia of everything. Ambitious as the project is, it would certainly keep me occupied for a year. The challenge would be to sub divide everything into 365 discrete units, allowing me to pluck one from the middle of each day, and to dazzle you with a well crafted splurge of pros. A moment thought gazing out of the window, crows in the wind was enough to convince me of the full hardiness of that idea. But if instead of dealing with everything, I limit myself to one particular topic, say birds or eggs or football stars of the 1930s, or instances of shadow puppetry in the cinema, I run the risk of boring you lot and myself, there must be a happy medium, somewhere between the general and the particular, not quite everything perhaps but an encyclopedia of muck. I then have to decide how to construct it, what arrangements to follow the temptation just to stare out of the window again becomes overwhelming. One way to begin would be by telling you that a window is made out of glass. But the crow I could see in the failing light through the window was not made of glass. It's entirely possible to make a toy or decorative or model crow out of glass. But it's difficult to imagine a window made out of crows. Let us nonetheless imagine such a thing, you would need to gather together a fair number of crows and jam them into a frame. So such that they such as they filled the space within the frame. To keep the crows in place it will be best to slaughter them and then stuffed them using your taxidermy skills. You would then remove the glass window in its frame and replace it with the crow window which I think you will rapidly notice occludes most if not all of the light blazing in from the outside. Only right now the light is failing, not blazing. So the new crow window makes little difference. Either way, you still need some interior artificial light, such as that emitted by candle flames, unless you wish to sit slumped in the darkness, imagining out on the lawn, a crow my glass. Consider then how everything relates to everything else. Birds to Windows, taxidermy to candle light, darkness to darkness at the dawning of the year. encyclopedia topics addressed candles, crows, glass stuffing.

JOHN has just reminded me of course that the correct pronunciation of crow is cruel. As in, you know, nothing cruel. Anyway, three weeks have passed since I wrote that and if you've been keeping up with the hooting yard website, you will know that just like the diaries of two years ago and the birds of one year ago, the whole encyclopedia project as petered out already, but never mind. But I've been able to follow up a couple of things. And, for example, I said that it was hard to imagine a window made out of crows. Not for the first time I was wrong, astonishingly so given that ornithology was involved, but wrong nevertheless. Soon after posting that on the website at hooting yahoo.org I got a letter from puppy Nesbitt all the way from the eastern United States, and poppy wrote as follows. In the long ago, I occasionally worked on local theatrical extravaganzas, my favorite being Zeit Geist, an excruciating interpretation of human life from beginning to end. We the perpetrators of this cultural Maelstrom, took over the very small town hall in a very small town nearby. The building had a central front door and hallway flanked by two miniscule offices, and leaving to a large open room with a stage at the far end. As a preface to the main event on stage, we made the offices into a birth room and a death room. It is the death room that requires description. The house I now live in had belonged to artists for a long time, and the Higgledy Piggledy remains of their art of their art lives. We're still in the band studio when I moved here. One of the artists was a portrait painter of subject to all looked like characters from Agatha Christie. The studio was overflowing of petrified tubes of oil paint, bristle free brushes, Canvas stretchers, human bones, broken glass and empty frames. My favorite relic being paintings with the faces cut out and the rest of the image left intact. as a backdrop for the death room these edited portraits were hung on the walls above dead leaves piled high, so deep that people could only wade through them with difficulty. The result of noise was full of memories. The room had a dilemma that demanded solving a large window facing the parking lot. We felt that the evening trajectories of headlights would spoil the mood on the night of the performance of Zeit Geist, so we cut silhouettes of flying crows crews out of a piece of black foam core board and fitted it over the glass. A sheer curtain was hung over this on the inside, making the window and managment invisible in the general murk. The headlights swept through the birds like a fog beacon flaring up for a moment and projecting distorted avian outlines onto the folds of the curtain and the floating dust of the leaves. It left a surging impression of flight that was surprisingly spooky. Even now whenever I see crows, I remember motion of light in black bird shapes filling up a window and that was from poppy Nesbitt and very good it is to and I think I'm sad that I never got to see Zeit Geist

In spite of the example set by my older siblings, I was as a child reluctant to join an organized group, such as the Boy Scouts, or the Woodcraft folk, or the young pioneers, or the kiboko gift. I kept myself to myself, content of all up about in self imposed solitude. All that changed over on the day when I was eight years old, and I received an invitation to join peewit patrol. I had never heard of this little fraternity. So I was intrigued. intriguing to with the invitation itself, which was delivered to my bedroom window sill, in the beak of a bird, I supposed was a p word. It took the form of a folded sheet of paper, which, when extracted from the birds beak and unfolded revealed a message which looked as if it had been scribbled in blood.

Come to the spinny at midnight at Red, where you will be initiated into peewit patrol. It was unsigned. That night, I went up to bed at my usual time, and pretended to be asleep. Excited and alert. I listened out for the sounds of my siblings and my parents retiring for the night. When all was still, I crept out of bed, fashioned a rope ladder from my bedsheets and let myself out through the window. The spinny was out on the edge of our bucolic and idyllic village, and I ran like the clappers to get there before midnight struck. I was puffed out when I arrived. And for a moment I thought someone had played a trick on me, as the spinny seemed to be deserted. But then one by one from behind clumps of trees appeared several children a dozen or so. At least I thought they were children. They were all about my size. But I didn't recognize any of them because their faces were concealed. Each for a painted Pappy and mash a helmet in the shape of a pea which head roughly double the size of their own heads. from the neck down. They were dressed conventionally save for a tab od and a sash, a goped. One of them now stepped forward and greeted me. He explained that I was to be initiated into p with control, a great honor, but one which I must keep secret. a bonfire was lit and the children began to pronounce and caper in a circle around it uttering shrill cries, which might have been imitative of a pee wit call. I was taken by the hand and pulled into the ring and did my best to pronounce and caber and shriek like the others. When we were all at the point of exhaustion, as a signal, we stopped still. The circle regrouped with me now at the center. The child if it was a child, who had first greeted me now made a long and frankly incoherent announcement. The gist of it was, I was able to gather was that I was to be welcomed into the fraternity of P word patrol, and I must swear to serve it with all my gumption. A bump a bottle of squelch, a sort of fizzy pop was opened and passed around and each one took a swig before it was passed to me, I Swigged and swore and then the tab od and the sash were draped over me and the painted Pappy and mash A p with helmet was placed upon my head. I was a member of pirate patrol. And there and then I set off on my first patrol of the village perimeter in the moonlight sworn to protect the village from harm. We were each armed with a stick gathered from the spinny floor, and we marched slowly, keeping on watchful look out through the apertures in our helmets. Occasionally, one or other of my companions would make the shrill pee would cry. It was an exquisite thrill for me, who had been so solitary to feel a sense of belonging, belonging to a secret illicit band, but one which acted for the good at the village, unknown to the adult villages. And the thrill was never more exquisite than on those nights when we came upon a vagrant or a beggar, or somebody who just looked a bit funny, and we swoop down upon them in a terrible flock, beating them savagely with our sticks. And when they were crumpled and helpless on the ground, we fell upon them, pecking at them in a frenzy. With the razor blades embedded in our Pappy imagine a beat, saving the village from outsiders who would do us harm. Happy Days.

After I posted that lovely little story on the hooting yard website, I got a letter from David cranmer. The man who invented the theremin badger, badger theramin. Anyway, it's a ceremony in the form of stuff badger fantastic thing. Somewhere on the pooting yard website, you can see a photo of it. If you put federal in badger into the coating yard search engine near the top of the page, I'm sure you'll find it. Anyway. David cranmer. having read peewit patrol asked about my use of the phrase running like the clappers. The clapper is referred to as those of bells, which strikes the inner surface of the bell to create that clang we know and love, and occasionally stuff cotton wool in our ears to muffle. It's argued that the clappers of belled do not run nor trot, nor scamper. All I can offer in my defense is that the phrase meaning to go very fast, seems to have originated with Royal Air Force public school chaps during the Second World War. The Oxford English Dictionary cites Eric partridges, not p whipped note, a dictionary of forces slang 1939 to 1945 published by Secker and Warburg in 1948. Further citations suggests that it can rain like the clappers, and that one can both surrender and go to work like the clappers. So running towards a spinny for an initiation ceremony in the moonlight seems equally viable. It should be noted that the bells the crappers of which go so very fast, a specified by Partridge as the bells of hell. It's so happens that Dobson the Titanic out of print pamphleteer of the last century, devoted one of his pamphlets to this very subject. fanatical hooting yardas may recall with piece originally posted on the website five years ago, in the dying days of the Gordon Brown administration. The bells of Hell do not ring says CEO frustra dog and they Clank and clunk eternally, awfully definitely. This is because they are battered and broken with great cracks and fissures. He adds that they are covered in mold of stinking greeny gray. There are no bells in hell we are told by pehlu pus taxi for he says the cranks and clumps of the den of infernal machinery, engines of havoc designed to torment the damned if there be stinking mold upon the machines he does not say while optrex gibbous mind There are precisely 10,000 bells in hell. Each of them numbered, each in its own Belfry, and they are run by sinners in expiation, the bell poles in the form of vipers, which bite the center's hands and wrists. Each time they peel and designated Belle. Dobson's pamphlet, hell, it's Belle's out of print is an attempt to untangle the contradictions in these authorities, each of which we contend, has at least a grain of truth. Are there bells in hell? He asks, or are there not? If there are, there's a ring or do they Clank and clunk? Are there 10,000 bells or fewer or more, even in even an infinity of bells, just as there is an infinity of pits, and dungeons and kubelet in which the damned languish forever. The pamphlet is research for this paper, which he read aloud at a meeting of the sawdust bridge platform debating initiative on the 10th of April 1954. Let him up some pretty horrible pathways, pathways more apparent even than the one that runs parallel to the disgusting canal. We're in the vomit of generations is collected.

Frank Key  21:31
Why it is drunks and those with stomach disorders have habitually seen fit to throw up their guts in a canal basin. At the end of a long and twisting lane, far from any clinics and hostelries is a mystery. Dobson never investigated so far as we know. But he was spell bound by the bells of hell, upon which he believed so much so very, very much hinged. It's a pity he never got around to writing the follow up pamphlet, how its bells and all that hinges upon them with lots of details of work which exists only in the form of illegible scribblings in a notebook, half of which is burned, and the remaining half smeared with a stinky greeny grey goo, which might be mold scraped from the bowels of hell, but might on the other hand, just be the sort of glue that Dobson managed to attract himself in his wanderings. God knows how. hooting out encyclopedia topics addressed held bells. Good.

Finally, this week, I'm going to read some verse I'm going to recite some verse duggleby duggleby screaming scroll, faith a complete monkey's paw, wicker basket cloister half the benefits of an electric bath dugald bS lanton duggleby tent who knows where van Houston went? lumbar puncture, lumberyard. janissary janitor century guard cuxhaven diphthongs and candy floss. This paint mat that paint gloss one must not forget emotion nor attraction and repulsion. Magnets hopes and fears and a pair of gardening shares. He is still wet behind the ears. This rag will mop up all his tears duggleby went to Banbury Cross, but he didn't give a toss. crocus merrigan marigold fuchsia egg to nail down in the second leg.

The grunt the groan, the Pang, the grouse the mordant herons on the bank. Oh the trains the chains like Clank liposuction Foley roll, cutting capers eyeless doll creeping past the graveyard tombs. Distant gunfire distant booms squelchy pig boy guttersnipe linctus soup, Japan hose pipe. He has a job, but I have none. Ah, he flew to near the sun. That is why his jug is cracked. Now we're ready for the final act duggleby down the curtains well, lilac scattered on tortoise shell, not withstanding Kevin pag. He kept them in his Pipi bag duggleby duggleby. Move along. That's the end of the duggleby song. That's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I'll be back next week. Just to remind you, as if you're not going to be reminded endlessly about the forthcoming voting, voting art, the forthcoming resonance FM fundraising week. And there'll be an auction of things, as I say usually is, and this year, the shooting yard contribution to the auction is as follows. This is a sneak preview, I think that's okay. The highest bidder when when of course the auction is open, the highest bidder for the hooting yard thing will have their name or the name of a loved one of their choice. In other words, you know, it might be you or it might be your grandfather or aren't child Jesuit priest anyway, the name of a loved one who will say, oh, you're online included as part of the title of an out of print Dobson pamphlet to be mentioned in a specially written story. I mean, if that's not worth 45 pens of anybody's money, I don't know what is there is also going to be an additional treat, as for the highest bidder for that prize, but I don't want to give too much away. But you might like to start, you know, saving your pennies for February the ninth to the 15th, which is when the resonance fundraiser is, of course, hooting yard itself is always on a fundraiser. You can go straight to the hooting yard website and donate money to me if you so wish. You don't have to be it would be nice if you did.

Frank Key  28:34
And but you it's probably compulsory to donate to resonance. There's probably some system involved whereby the radio or computer you're listening to will explode if you don't send money. I'm going to stop babbling and go away now. Bye bye.
