Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com My name is Frank Kay. This is hooting yard on the air. And I've said it before and I'll say it again. reportage is the lifeblood of hooting yard. The reason I say it again is to drum into your heads. Drum it into your heads is a distressing number of listeners who seem to believe that I make all this stuff up. Quite apart from the sheer foolishness of doing so. I'm never mindful of best Johnson's dictum, telling stories is telling lies. And as van oxen Stewart put it so cogently would I lie to you? You need not attempt to answer that now. Just listen, I made the rounds. To bolster hurting your reputation as a respectable Space Age information provider. I have decided to appoint a fact check team. They will go about their business independently without fear or favor, digging and rummaging and fossicking where their piercingly honed instinct take them. If it should so happen that they come upon an instance of inaccuracy or outright lying, I will accept their ruling and remove the offending postage from the hooting yard blog. replacing it with a correction written by the team. I will even say arrange things, but the correction appears in big bright red bold capital letters, accompanied perhaps by a skull and crossbones symbol, such as one sometimes finds on bottles of poison that should liven things up. So let me introduce you to the team. There are three of the there are three members, each of whom graduated, if that's the word I want, from Pang Hill orphanage, bam and bam and little nitti each have long experience of the kind of painstaking drudgery necessary to hunt down the fact. Although in their case, the painstaking drudgery they experienced was serving mail bags and a dank cellar by the light of a single Takeda lamp. I've always been a great believer in transferable skills. I'm also a great believer in the benefits of fresh air and hiking and long drawn out in the open air. That is why beam and bam and little nitti will do their fact checking in the field or on the ground, out and about. In any case, I do not want them cluttering up my chalet of pros and whimpering and eating me out of house and home. I can forage for nuts and berries and fresh puddles of water when they're in the field or on the ground. In order to in order to decide what the trio should investigate first, I conducted a lightning listeners poll. On what topic I asked Can BAM and bam and little nifty cut their chops as a tip top factory team. Typically the response I received Sorry, I meant to say responses chloral because I did ask more than one listener honestly Cross my heart and hope to ascend in glory to the ethereal realms. Anyway, among the responses I received, was this from one t Fern. Dear Mr. Key last night I lay awake, tossing and turning and biting and pummeling my plump o pillow bereft of even a second of shuteye because I'm so desperate to know if the orchard and hotel and squirrels referred to in Alfred pig tosses autobiography, I Alfred Picasa actually exist and if they do, I have supplementary questions. Not so much about the squirrels but regarding the orchard and hotel. They can wait however until bemmon BAM and little nisi have ascertained the brute reality or otherwise of the orchard and the hotel and the squirrels and reported back exhausted from their hike or jaunt having Cutler drops yours with bated but minty breath. t thurn.

I think you would have liked the next scene. Been BAM little nifty. I called in my most stentorian boom. They shuffled in spindly and unkempt and dribbling. Terry Thomas would have dismissed them as an absolute shower. But I had every confidence in my fat check team. Here. I said, Take these three partly prepay bus tickets, go to the bus stop and wait for a bus. When eventually a bus arrives, bought it and take it as far out into the countryside as it goes. Then ring the bell and alight and go in search of the orchard and hotel on squirrels mentioned in Alfred pig Tatas autobiography. I Alfred pig tasa. And don't get up to any mystery or it's backed up Pang Hill orphanage with you. Please Mr. Key, whimpered one of them. Bam, bam, all little Nitty, you know, weak, thin, quavering voice. How are we to survive in the countryside. When we're used to being given a bowl of gruel once a day at Grove time? I gave them each of them a hefty slap on the back and boomed. Fear not, the LORD Will Provide and if he does not, because your prayers are insufficiently abject, then I'm sure you will find opportunities to forage for nuts and berries and fresh puddle of water. Now Off you go before I summon the beetle to drag you back to the orphanage. The last I saw of them they were charging this complimentary to the bus stop. I have no doubt, however, that at this very moment. They are far away on some bleak blasted Heath or more. Their vitals stimulated by all that unaccustomed fresh air diligently seeking signs of an orchard at a hotel and some squirrels. As soon as they report back, assuming they can cobble together the bus fares for the return journey. I will let you know. And I will read out their paper. Sorry, I will read out their report in full. It will I'm sure confirm the existence of that orchard and that hotel. And those squirrels. Then tea turn can fire at me as many supplementary questions as he likes.

Letter plops onto the map. Dear beloved Mr. Key, we are lost, hopelessly hopelessly hopelessly lost. We write hopelessly thrice to indicate that each of us is hopeless. We would not have you think one is hopeless while two remain retain hope. Nor that two are hopeless and one's still hopeful. We're all hopeless and we are all lost. How we have come to this past may take some explaining. We got off the bus as you told us. We were on a lane. There was a hedge. There might have been birds nesting in the hedge. There was certainly a sign of nest if not a bird had a bird return to the nest while we stood there in the binary the bus chugged away into the distance. There is every chance we might have killed the bird for food. We were famished lucky bird then that it was often out somewhere in the sky in flight. repaired over the hedge. There was a field. It was an extensive field containing several cows. With pondered Kevin one of the cows for food, but could not come up with a method. Had there been a bird in the nest in the head. We could have bombed down upon it the three of us menacingly and made short work of it to could hold it still, while we're third throttled it we looked at a cow and tried to picture applying that same method. was not a convincing picture. We cast our six eyes around in case there might be a pile of rocks in the field or beside the lane. With a rock of sufficient size, we thought one of us might bash the cow about the head until it dropped dead. But because we might, there seemed to be nothing bigger than a stone or a pebble. neither of which we thought would prove fatal to a cow. No matter how hard we hit it. We had to bear in mind the presence of several cows, and assume that the ones we did not attack would come rushing to the aid of the one we did. A few quick sharp blows with a big rock would kill a cow before the other cows came a charging, but we would have no such a window of opportunity. With mere pebbles. We dismissed the cows as a possible source of food and turned our attention back to the lane. We were famished. But at this stage, we were not yet hopeless nor indeed lost. After all, we had only just alighted from the bus and had not yet had time to get our bearings. In our hearts, there was a flicker of optimism that within a few hundred yards, we might come upon the orchard with its squirrels, or the hotel or both. We decided to walk along remain in the same direction in which the bus had traveled. The bus itself had disappeared over the horizon. Ahead of us, we could see various clumps and slopes and distant buildings, hence our hope. Shortly afterwards, we came upon a puzzle of recent rain water, we fell upon our knees and drank our fill. It was a big puzzle, so we did not drain it. We spotted in it a small pale, almost translucent riving wriggling wormy McAfee kind of being food, we could have compared notes on whose fannish meant with most debilitating or drawn lots, but instead, and in spite of it tininess, having plucked it from the puddle, we chopped it into three equal portions. squatting beside the puddle, we then sucked on our helping rather than bolting it down to eat from it all the nourishment we could, and to make it last as long as possible. Yum. Thus fortified if only minimally, we toiled on along the lane, certain clumps and slopes and distant buildings grew closer. None was yet close enough to ascertain whether an orchard or hotel was among them. pangs of thirst now beset us as the wormy maggoty thing had proved surprisingly salty. We encountered no further puzzles. But then the hedge beside the lane came to a sudden stop, and then its place was a ditch. In the ditch was a great deal of water, an admixture of recent rain and some kind of filthy muck riddled brownish liquid oozing up from below.

We judged that were we to drink it, we would be at risk of stomach cramps and digestive horrors and many another gastric malady. gastric may not be the appropriate word, but let it stand. So we trudged on the water ejector alongside us like a cruel tone to the devil's. It may have been about this time, we began to lose hope. But we were still not lost. Because we could see the clumps and slopes and distant buildings I had. We had something to aim towards, be it butter shimmer. But then a mist descended. It was a thick mist. We could not even see our hands in front of our faces, let alone the clumps and slopes and distant buildings. There was some relief in the fact that moisture was present in the mist. So if we dealt with mouthfuls of it and swallowed our first raged a little less, a little less, but enough enough, if you can put yourself in the place of a famished and first ravaged orphan, recently discharged from an orphanage and sent into the rustic wasteland on a fact checking mission by a writer of unparalleled dreaminess accompanied by two similarly discharged and famished and thirst ravaged orphans from the same orphanage on the same factchecking mission. You will appreciate how greedily we gulped that missed moisture In fact, we were so revitalized, that we said, Sure, to the mist, the three of us in unison, and we blended onwards, even though we could not see where we were going. This was our undoing. For when the mist cleared, as suddenly as it had descended, there was no sign of the clumps and the slopes and the distant buildings. There was merely a bleak expanse of nothingness. We were lost, and we were hopeless. Excuse me. We were lost, and we were hopelessly hopelessly, hopelessly lost. We slumped against a blob of the nothingness that that night that we slumped against a blob of the nothingness that might have been a vestige of Heg, or of the side of a ditch. We stopped quietly for a while. Then we wrote this report, it says an interim report, hopeless, we may be thrice hopeless, but we shall press on with our mission, as if it were a metaphor for man's life upon this mortal coil. If you receive this letter, you will know that at least we stumbled upon a postbox. What the postbox is a metaphor for we leave for you to judge yours. Lost and hopeless, you're devoted fact checking team, then bam, and little nifty

Excuse me, I'm gonna have a sip of tea. Or now I should have done that while the music was playing. But hey, I didn't and it has been said that Dobson the out of print pamphleteer bestrode the 20th century like a Colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself when still a young man. At the age of 20, he published a pamphlet

Frank Key  18:08
excuse me, at the age of 20, he published a pamphlet resoundingly entitled. Why I showed the strides this century like a Colossus. It is a curious work out of print, of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper Swan on the cover. It begins that I show bestride this century, like a Colossus My name will ring out like a clarion. in years to come. Whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers there won't be but one name on their lips. Dobson such self belief in so cambogia youth is touching, looking back in his dotage. Dobson found it touching to and he took to sitting with his one remaining copy of the pamphlet, clutched his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end. When marigold crew found him that she flung open the windows, whatever the weather unstamped around the room, singing loud, coolest sea shanties, ones that involve pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sail cloth, salt, seaweed, hard tack, biscuits, fog, horns, sirens, rigging, anchors, and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson's self pitying lassitude would be broken, and he would have a curiously pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe away his tears, Dawn, his Bolivian military boots, and his Stalinist cardigan and crashed out of the house to go on one of his drums. obstinately Jones in the latter part of his life usually took him to the nearest pigsty. But there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far that day that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other devised by Yoko Ono, as part of an art project to promote world peace. Postal delivery persons in that city were required by law to learn all the double street names by heart or to face summary dismissal. If they failed. Often those who did fail and there were many would flounder around on the outskirts of the city wearing warning travelers away. It was a paltry sort of revenge and seldom succeeded. For the devices that shining city on a hill attracted wayfarers from near and far daily in their thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before this particular Tuesday. A dismissed postal delivery person stepped out of stop the out of Brent pamphleteer as he was about to cross a pontoon bridge that would take him into the most boisterous quarter of the city. go no further out man, said this vengeful figure whose yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a mustard black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness. But these luxuriance is, and he formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same color as the down the white socket in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression, and lacking any variation in tonal Caden's. This city your approach is no place for out of print pamphlet is ever sensitive to warnings from spooks and race. Dobson turned around and went home. He found marigold Chu in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous sheet of corrugated cardboard. I was warned away from a shining city on a hill he said, Is it a city you have visited Barrick Gold to stop drilling, reset the safety cap and removed our protective goggles? You are a foolish old man in your dotage Dobson she said that there was kindness in her voice. And it is well you were warned away for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hell it sits atop is hollow and harbors within it heaven and some say hell. Either way. I am pleased to see you home. Let's just clear the nettles from the vegetable patch.

Frank Key  23:07
That was what happened on that Tuesday evening towards the end of the 20th century, did Dobson indeed bestride it as a Colossus. He was not the only person to think so, but the names of the others escaped me for the time being when I remember them, I will tell you

that piece, which appeared many years ago on the hooping website, has been chosen as a set text for the entrance examinations for bodgers spinny. Infant school. Here are some sample questions likely to be faced by the tiny candidates. And if you listened carefully, you may be able to answer them. I'm not sure that if you answer them correctly, you will actually win a place at budget spinny infant school one Imagine you're the dismissed postal delivery person who encounters Dobson by the pontoon bridge, would you have handled the situation in the same way? Think about what you would have said to the out of print pamphleteer then translate it into Latin. To do you think Yoko Ono's unnecessary double naming of the streets and the shining city on the hill would make a significant contribution to world peace? give reasons for your answer in terse cogent prose. then translate that into Latin two, three, give a brief account of the Arab David Blunkett with special reference days second resignation speech and tearful use of the phrase the little lad.

I've just been told I've only got 20 seconds left so it's probably now 10. So bye bye.
