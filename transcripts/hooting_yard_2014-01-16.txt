Good evening listening persons. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. If you're listening on one of those modern contraptions and this is hooting out on the air with me, Frank Kay, and I'm going to read to you for half an hour or so. The first thing I'm going to read to you today is a story called puny vercingetorix. I know that some of you might pronounce verkin gettering as their Savior to Reek but I pronounce it verkin guitar x c verkin. gettering. vercingetorix is puny. harc here puny verkin Garrick Clank? were four does he Clank it is the clanking of his armor as he marches puny verkin rhetorics is marching in his armor, over hills and far away. So puny Woking rhetoric that he has fallen behind the other markers. Yes, there are other markers. He does not March alone. puny vercingetorix is merely one tiny puny cog in a martial host. It is an army clanking over hills and far away. puny Woking rhetoric is bringing up the rear having fallen behind so far behind that even if his vision were piercing, he could barely see the host ahead. But he is short sighted as well as puny. He is short sighted and has no spectacles for nobody in the army is allowed spectacles. It is like the court of King George the Third. What usually happens when a straggler falls far behind the marching host is that they are waylaid and carried off by marauding bears. There have been countless newspaper reports of such occurrences, most distressing, most distressing. But puny verkin get her eggs. Though he is puny and myopic and neurasthenic and prone to terrible fits and something of a half wit is nevertheless possessed of a singular quality, which in his current circumstances, is as valuable as a chest crammed with precious stones. puny vercingetorix speaks the language of bears, at least the language of the bears that roam these hills far away. He was taught to speak with bears when tiny attached to a traveling circus. Now if there's a straggling marker cut off from the host, he is waylaid by bears, puny Woking. getronics will tilt his head to the appropriate angle and raise one eyebrow and make significant passing movements with his hands and from his throat will erupt the most extraordinary noise and the bears rather than carrying him off to their lair. Their to do him unimaginable harm. Will each of them flop to the ground and flail about beatific smiles on their faces. In the parlance of Dady he will have tickled their funny bones. Up ahead, the host is clashing with a rival host and army terrible with banners. puny verkin getronics is well out of it. He sits on a clump and takes from his pouch his curds and whey and snacks upon them, waiting for bears. It is the first Thursday of the 15th century.

That piece was first broadcast 600 years ago on what passed for residents 104 point four fm.com. No, that's wrong resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. Back in the, in the Middle Ages in the in the 15th century. Sure there was some kind of equivalent. Now, here's another story. This is an anecdote more than a story. There was a fig in my soup. I had not expected one. Oh, waiter, I said, gesturing the meanwhile with my outstretched hand in which I held the soup spoon. Waiter. This fig is it intentional. The waiter came barreling over. He was a rotund waiter but moved at speed. Sir, you are dribbling soup onto the floor with your spoon. It will need mopping up he said. That's quite enough back talk from you. I said. What I want to know is whether this fig look this fig in my soup is meant to be there. I would think so, to be more polite, said the waiter. And do you know what he clouded me on the head with his great hairy fist? I was nonplussed. First, I'd be nonplussed by the fig in my soup. Now I was further nonplussed by the cloud. Before I could gather my wit. The waiter who had barreled away came barreling back holding a mop. So we'll mop up the dribbled soup, and we may then discuss the fig. He said. What kind of cafeteria was this? I thought the words but did not say them. I'd not yet pulled myself together from my non placement, and there was a ringing in my ear from where the clouds had landed. But it was a pertinent question. One I will strive to answer once I have recovered from the many bumps and bruises I sustained after flatly refusing to deploy the mop. Whereupon several other waiters appeared as if from nowhere, and I was subjected to much clouding and thumping before being frogmarched out into the street, or rather Muse and dumped into a puddle there to be spat upon by a passing horse whose drover gave me a kicking for good measure. The drover having a familial connection with at least two of the waiters, all of whom had gone back into the cafeteria, traveling and muttering to themselves the word fig and soup and mop and get clearly audible. Even with the ringing in my ears. Yes, is for both now we're bringing what would the additional clouds and thumps I had received for no other crime than querying the figure in my soap and remonstrating with the waiter for his impertinent to speak to a gentleman So, and then by Heaven to cloud him. What kind of cafeteria was it? What kind of world is it?

I'm going to take this opportunity to remind listeners of the fundraising efforts of all of us here, resonance 104 point four FM. And we basically need money to keep the show on the road. And what would be a good idea would be for all of you listening at the moment to send 10 pounds, just go to the resonance website where you'll find you'll find an easy bit thing to just press and make a donation and 10 a tenner, you know, that would be a reasonable amount for you to send. I mean, you can send more, of course, if you wish, you could even send less, but 10 pounds sends a nice tidy sum, every little helps. And if the more money you send, and the more you, you, you on losing my track here, the more money you send, the more money resonance will have and the less likely it is that will keep moaning at you on air as I'm doing now, to make a donation. So it would be very good. If you could do that, go to the resonance website, pledge 10 pounds to resonance fm.com. And then we will all be happy and your favorite radio station will remain on the air for another 15 minutes or so perhaps even longer. Okay, I'm going to read something else now, which is a the latest bulletin from the doings of Dobson the 20th century's Titanic out of print pamphleteer. Remind me Dobson said marigold true one morning over breakfast. Did you ever write that pamphlet you planned about the bandicoot the out of print pamphleteer was fumbling with his fork, trying to spear on its tines, one of the shriveled boiled otter heads swimming in a broth of gummy pap with doc weed in his breakfast bowl. So terrific was his concentration that he barely heard his in amaranta. And she repeated the question after taking a swig of new breakfast variety squelch Joe from a tumbler. Dobson throw in the towel, put down his fork and reached for a stick of celery style impacted vegetable matter. waving it in a show of flamboyance. He announced I will never write another word about birds. This exchange took place during the closing stages of the Battle of dmvpn Fu. So with hindsight, were able to note that Dobson's statement was ludicrously inaccurate. I do adore your non sequiturs. Dobson said marigold true, but do tell I'm agog to know about the bandicoot pamphlet his mouth full of curiously tasteless vegetable matter. Dobson gazed at his enamorado as if she had taken leave of her senses. This table manners being impeccable, he did not attempt and immediate reply marigold waited upon his munching she herself was a dab hand with the fork and the otter heads, and had finished her breakfast some minutes ago. Your remark regarding non sequiturs seems to me a non sequitur, in and of itself, said Dobson. Eventually, then his voice rising, shouted, be that as it may, when I say I shall never again write a single word on the subject of birds. I mean it and now I'm going to go out in the rain to no apparent purpose. I can think of a purpose Dobson said marigold too brightly. While you're out in this apocalyptic downpour. Perhaps you could stop by the kiosk in the shadow of the viaduct and pick up a copy of the daily digest of the doings of small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores for me.

Frank Key  14:23
As he struggled to dawn his Eritrean official goat wizards boots with their exceedingly complicated lacing protocol, the pamphleteer said, you don't normally take that publication. Is there any reason for the sudden interest? I think there might be something in it that I want to show you Dobson, she said, an enigmatic smile on her lips. stamping his feet to finally lodge them firmly into his boots. Dobson took his hat and coat and crashed out of the door into the rain. He wondered why on earth marigold thought he might be interested in small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores when his head was filled with unrelated matters, including Hungarian football, a spheric push gas plinky plunky piano music, weird sausages, asteroid belt and plums. And one thing I'm most definitely not interested in, he shouted at a swan. As he passed the pond is birds, any birds, all birds, and that includes you Swan and your powers, the teal and mergansers and buffleheads and qute and bandicoot. Later, sopping wet. Dobson arrived home with a copy of the daily digest of the doings of small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores, which the kiosk is had very thoughtfully plopped into a waterproof bag for him as a small extra charge. Here is your magazine, he said, tossing it onto the table as a puddle formed around his feet. marigold two took it from the bag, leaf through it and alighted on a short an interesting article illustrated with several black and white snapshots taken by Tip Top marsupial snapper Rex soufeel on the subject of the bandicoot. When you have a moment, Dobson said, you might want to take a look at this, I'll make a pot of tea and shortly afterwards, the out of print pamphleteer learned his horror, that everything he had intended to say about bandicoots in his projected pamphlet, hundreds of pages of scribbled notes and jottings, and Ill turned sentences of foolish conjecture was as dust was as dust and ashes. All of it. Every word with Aaron nonsense. The bandicoot was not a type of coot. It was not even a type of bird. Dobson slumped in his chair and held his head in his hands. The cup of tea went cold.

Just before the music ended, I sneezed. And usually when I sneeze, sneezes come in twos or threes. And there's only been one so far. So I'm gonna, I'm hoping I'm not going to sneeze again. But if I do, wipe your radio down with a damp cloth. And I'd like to share with you a piece of rustic wisdom that I heard on another radio, a different radio station. Apparently it was quite news to me, but there are other radio stations. This one is run by the BBC called radio four. And they have a program on very early in the morning called the six in the morning, which I always listened to because I'm always awake at that time of day. And in fact, I'm not only awake, I'm up and about and farming today and the other the other day on farming today, a farmer said and this is a direct quotation which I want you to memorize and act upon. I'll try to do it in a kind of farmery voice. You cannot afford not to be with a sheep at 430 in the morning and in any non farmer speech To drive the point home, you cannot afford not to be with a sheep at 430 in the morning, Mike, is that what you will? This is a story called in dingley Dell. I tripped and toppled and tumbled down and down and came to land flat on my back in dingley Dell a bump or two to the head during my tumble conked me out. And by the time I woke flat on my back in dingley, Dell, the sky was growing dark. Up above I saw the first flickers of stars closer to the ground to I saw two small points of light. I reason they must be the glittering eyes of nameless del dwelling beast and I sat up Was it a wolf? Was it a badger? that had been said of me that I'm insanely courageous when confronted by unknown quadrupeds I picked up a pebble and tracted aiming at a point directly between the two lights out I heard it was a human Ouch. And all too human. Ouch. I felt immediately mortified. I concur with Terence who said humani nihill mei le a non puto or nothing that is human is alien to me. I was ashamed that I had so thoughtlessly pelted one of my own fellows with a pebble Forgive me, I cried before the finger had even emerged from the dusk struck Dingle. Forgive me, I cried before the finger had even emerged from the dusk struck dingley Dell DAF. When it did so emerge, I saw that it was a man Oh, very much like me, but have considerably smaller stature. That explained why the point of light were nearer to the ground. Why hired mistaken them for the eyes of something in human that crawls upon the earth on all fours. Forgiveness is not in my nature, said the little man who now stood before me. I am vengeful, and when panic stricken irrationally, so watch. And then he performed what I can only describe as a dazzling, incomprehensible fan Fernald of acrobatic imbecility. Allow me to introduce myself, he said when he was done, as if nothing dazzling and incomprehensible and acrobatic and imbecilic had happened. I am the dwarf Keira Pascoe helped me to in fact Totem to principal Jen CO, who lives up yonder, far from dingley Dell, in a benighted and crumbling castle swarming with mice and bats. The word most often applied to me, apart from dwarvish, and Machiavellian and too clever by half is indispensable. And it is my very indispensability, which caused the green in twining tendrils of envy to

Frank Key  23:31
form in the heads of principal gente O's more dim witted and brutish henchmen. tendrils that grew so rapidly, like choked off what little sense was a lodged in those henchman heads until come last Thursday. Several of them lay in wait for me behind an heiress and then to balustrade hard by the castle crenellations. And when I pass by with my nose guy, and the pin cushion of God, they waylaid me and stuffed me into a sack, and carried me off. I knew not where I screeched and struggled to no avail, for I am of diminutive frame, and the henchmen a huge great brutes, like giant oxen. It is worth noting that just before they tied the sack shot, I saw them trample my nose gate underfoot and toss the pin cushion of Gar over the castle crenellations so I can only assume it fell into the moat and is now sopping wet. If it has not been devoured by one of principal Gen CEOs snapping scavenge of fish. The prince regularly checks their stomach innards with a fiendishly intricate X ray scoping contraption I devised for him, and Lord knows what will happen when he discovers whatever remains of the pin cushion of God. If you He puts two and two together. And I have to say that's a big F. For principal Geneseo has a tiny brain like all his forebears, he will learn of his henchmen perfectly. His Roth will be apocalyptic. But without me by his side to direct his actions, he will no doubt muck everything up, blaming the alignment of stars in the heavens, hanging the wrong henchmen and splattering his morning porridge on the castle walls. What he will not do is think to send out a search and rescue helicopter to search for and rescue me. I'm going to have to take care of that myself. Though it's beyond even my wit to know how to expedite such a mission. I was thinking hard on that very matter hidden in the dark when you pelted me with a pebble, jolting my cranium, and that's wreaking havoc with the fine tuning of my elegant code rotations. Now, I shall have to begin again. You are probably wondering how I know I'm in the dingley Dell, given that I was delivered here while tied up and muffled in a sack. Yes, those traitorous henchmen carried me here all the way from the castle before depositing me in that Dell ditch over there. By the time I managed to make my escape from the sack and clamber up and out of the ditch, the henchmen were gone. But being in a radical breach stupid, they'd left behind the steam powered satnav that a guided them whether it was almost exhausted of power, and was about to hiss and splutter to a halt. But I just about had time to read the coordinates on its display. All I need to do now is recover from the effects of that pebble blow, then work out how to contact the search and rescue helicopter control tower. An ordinary dense person would be helpless. But I am a dwarf Keira Pascoe, and nothing. Nothing is beyond me.

Frank Key  27:20
I must admit that while my little man was telling me all this, I dozed off, I've only been able to transcribe the entirety of his speech because he left behind him a dicta belt recording, similar to the dicta belt recordings made by the police motorcyclist accompanying the presidential motorcade in Dallas on the 22nd of November 1963. That is acoustically bewildering, and fuzzy. But I managed to make out corpuscles words after having the recording enhanced using the most up to date new techniques. I was awakened from my dose by the whirring of helicopter blades. By the time I sat up and rubbed my head and took a sip of squelch Oh, from my canteen, the helicopter was gone. Taking the dwarf crew Pascoe with it. I wish the little man well stood up, placed my empty squelch choke can in the dingley Dell municipal waste shoot, which, as I learned in Atlanta and lecture I once attended, terminated the earth core. pounded my chest with my fists like a large and energetic monkey. And when did my way up and out of dingley Dell, towards the worst horror of all.

Frank Key  29:03
I've managed not to sneeze, although I think I might do so now. That's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. hooting out on the air. Where are we back on resonance 104 point four FM next week. Bye bye.
