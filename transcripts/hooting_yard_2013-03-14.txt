Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Excuse me, we're going to begin this week with a couple of historical pieces pieces, which listeners long familiar with the show will have heard before long, long ago. And there are two reasons why I'm reading our pieces, but you don't really need to know what they are. Although one of them will be fairly obvious to you, and one of them is an updated, I'll paste. This first piece that I'm going to read that is not updated. It just is what it is. And it's a recipe for grool you will need the following ingredients out water. The following equipment is essential. A big pot, a big spoon, the Holy Bible. On a blustery winter's day with a chill in the very marrow of your poor poor bones. Take the big pot and carry it trudging through snow to the rusty spigot on the other side of the village. weeping, use what little strength you have to turn the spigot until a woeful dribbling of brackish water appears. Make sure you place the big iron pot under the drip, so that water collecting it. With luck and prayer, you should find that the pot is about three quarters full before Twilight. When Of course, the village curfew comes into effect. The evil Grand Vizier proclaimed so in his UK to make sure that all pious people are behind their latched and bolted to doors by nightfall. Place the big pot on your oven and set it on full. Remember that it can take electric cookers longer to heat up than gas ones, but do not despair. Once your ovens maximum heat is reached, the water will bubble away like nobody's business to prevent steam escaping. It is a splendid idea to cover the pot if long ago when you were feckless, you lost or mislaid the lid of your pot. Or if indeed your pot never had a lid for not all pots do. You can of course improvise a lid using all sorts of debary strewn Higgledy Piggledy about your hovel. Just be sure you use flame resistant debary please. Now then, while you're waiting for the water to come to the boil, you can go and find the oats while I take a well earned nap.

Frank Key  03:32
I am now fully rested and in tip top condition. Let us press on without further ado, for by now your pot of water should be boiling. Please pay attention as the next step if fumbled, will put paid to your dearest wish, which is to make a successful pot of Grewal. with your right hand, scoop some out from the pail. Grasp the lid of the pot. If there is one in your left hand and lift it free of the pot. Cast the handful of votes into the seething cauldron and Replace the lid. You may repeat this step once or twice, but on another account overdo the oats as this will spoil your group making it too thick. And as the only remedy for this would be to add more water, you would have to return to the spigot breaking the village curfew and so risk being clubbed within an interviewer life by merciless curfew cadet and your gruul in perfect though it may be would then go to waste sin upon sin. You will now free to allow the contents of the pot to boil merrily away. Although of course from time to time you want to brandish the big spoon in your fist and give the gruel to be a mighty stir In the intervals between stirrings, you must another account remain idle. This is the perfect time to read improving passages from the Bible. Indeed, why not throw open your door stand upright and magnificent in your weed choked yard and declaim the scriptures in a booming voice for the benefit of whoever may be within earshot in the vast and pitiless night. To little reminders, though, however resounding your declaration, do not allow into your tone, even the most miniscule taint of vanity. Remember that you are merely a vessel and a singularly unlovely vessel that a tarnished urn, say, or a grubby beaker. Second, do not forget the pot for if it is neglected, you will likely to make not Grewal button Inferno. Oh, I said two reminders, but there is a third, use your cough to rub a modicum of grime from your humble window. Do you see a bleak and illimitable Vista of ice and snow? Are you marooned in an Arctic wasteland? If so, you may succumb to the delusions of pit bloco in which case you should refrain from following the directions of this recipe until you are relieved of your symptoms and are restored to your usual vigor. I need hardly point out the dangers of cooking when you are bonkers. Although I have written an excellent little book entitled safe and simple snacks for the bid designed and the fraud, which is charmingly illustrated. The original pencil sketch of a cream cracker has been framed and displayed on the wall of my splendid restaurant in hemoglobin towers where Worley is once the gruel is fully boiled, replace the Bible on your lectern, or somewhere at any rate, where it will be safe from defilement. If such a cranny exists in your hovel. Hold the spoon in your right hand removing the potluck with your left. Give that group one last Remove from heat allowed to stand for 10 minutes. Using a monstrous ladle, transfer into preheated 10 bowls and serve best eaten with a spoon suitable for home freezing.

The second piece, the second the second old piece I'm going to read or reread is extremely timely. Because it's of course the hooting yd pontiff mnemonic. This has proved enormously helpful to thousands of Catholics and non Catholics around the world. You know when someone stops you in the street and demands that you name all the Pope's in chronological order from Peter onwards. Well, using them mnemonic, you can do just that. The initial letters of the following words match the initial letters of the names of the Pope's. So that will help you to remember the names of the Pope's. All you need to do is memorize this simple mnemonic and it has been updated you'll be pleased to hear it was updated eight years ago, and it's now been updated again.

how useful mnemonic is and how coherent so to follow coherence, some incoherence that bag hot talc Flim Flam of the highest order cutthroat to board ship, the ship of state flying under a false flag, a flag of convenience registered in a distant port Pettigrew snarled. Melville writes somewhere of inhuman hooting a prize for the first to find out where I already know because I read the words yesterday morning, by dawn's early light, or by candlelight, or both or neither squinting at the small print. Does Peters. Does Peter Quint ever squint in the turn of the screw? I don't know. That was Henry James, of course not Herman Melville, both Americans but only one of them ended his days in the grip of Mad delusions, or perhaps like both did both did. Both did. Both did. Both did. If you say it aloud, over and over again. Its meaning becomes lost. It becomes a kind of atavistic chant to be chanted while leaping and capering around a bonfire in a night swarming with demons. In a forest clearing your body painted with wild. Both did both did. Both did both did. It could be the name of a god. But what sort of God, the God of bees, the God of herons, perhaps at a pinch the otter God, I can well imagine if daubed in woad shrieking a prayer to both did the author God, by the light of a bonfire in a forest clearing, waving a tally stick thousands of years ago, thousands and thousands or just last week. But if last week, that kind of thing, you might get arrested for these days. Imagine the interrogation in the coal bear room of the police station, you would have to explain yourself to win your freedom. Otherwise, they might lock you up charging you as mad as the aged Henry James. I think Herman Melville's wife at some point was under pressure to have her husband declared insane. She refused. His wife refused. The title of a piece from David Burns score for the Catherine wheel, choreographed, as I recall by Twyla Tharp. Now, there's a woman who lends herself to anagram ization, especially in Welsh. And while we're on the subject of Welsh, however, fugitive Lee, is it not splendid that the Welsh language word for a microwave oven is a property pin? That at least is the claim made by Roger Lewis in one of his newspaper articles. it's ever been a wonder to me that I'm not employed by a newspaper to write a column. I could backtrack a few hundred words on any subject required. prongs, tines and nozzles would be three examples of topics I could blather about, not to mention damp bags and hot towel with which we began if you remember. But what of damp towel can hot bags? What then? What then? I used to know a couple whose idea of sightseeing went on holiday with the gaze into the windows of bookcase shops, appraising the meat on display. What curious behavior. I recall, I was both amused and a little disgusted of a common combination of emotions. I think there may have been an admixture of contempt, contempt Lamech re in French, and the title of a 1963 film by john Locke, God. I've seen it twice, both times on television both times long ago. And all I remember of it is a shot or shot of an impossibly blue See, the bluest see I have ever seen in cinema. I think the film is considered a masterpiece. But then there's a certain type of film buff, who will forever wax preposterous about God odd.

Frank Key  18:16
The auteur God and the author God. Now there's a pairing almost homoclinic a pairing that lends itself as Twyla Tharp does to anagrams to the method outlined by Raymond Roussel in how I wrote certain of my book, I could write a piece about a wholly imaginary Godard film, one in which the Blue Blue Sea is reflected blue dazzlingly, in the glass window of a butcher's shop. The film could begin with a quotation from Herman Melville, and end with one from Henry James. And in between, in between for roughly 99 minutes. I have no idea for as I explained to a French art critic in New York only the other day, I do not have a visual imagination. That's why I work with words.

Frank Key  19:31
bits of that piece are entirely factual. In fact, the whole thing would now I come to think of it as factual all the references and anecdotal bits and bobs are all true. What place does pastry have in an EDL depends largely on whose ideal it is. pastry may well feature in the ideal of a baker or of a pastry cook. There again it may not. If the baker or pastry cook is fed up to the back teeth with the making and molding of pastry day in day out to the point of exhaustion, where he went his way homeward at the end of each pastry packed day and likes nothing better than to sink into his favorite armchair, and smoke his pipe and drink a cup of cocoa and Muse upon an ideal, wholly free of pastry to bear him away, if only in his brain from his everyday concerns. That after all, that bearing away within the brain is the purpose of an ideal, is it not? A starving man may fill his heels with pastry on a desert island, or marooned on an atoll far from shore. In such a case, the EDL may be so intense that it takes the form of a hallucination are shipwrecked solitary may feel the sensation of burning as he grasps a hot pastry in his hands, smell it smell, even taste it on his eager tongue, as he brings it to his lips before a vanishes or dissolves, being an idyllic and not a real pastry. From which we may conclude that real pastry has no place in an ill, thus, answering the query posed at the outset. By such means our prose helps us make sense of the world, and not merely of the real world, but of the phantasmal world of ideals. Is that not remarkable? That we can not only conceive of that which is not his mere brain vapor. But having conceived it, toss it this way, and that in our heads, mess and muck about a metal with it, as if it were a concrete thing, or indeed a piece of pastry, to the extent that we can arrive at a satisfactory conclusion about it. And it not exist in any material form. So there is real pastry, and there is a delicate pastry, can they ever be one and the same? There is something for you to consider you, not me. I'm done with pastry for today

with one or two excerpts from Dobson pamphlet, unrelated, this is from funerary customs of different types of birds. Number one, the seagull out of print. I happen to be present on the occasion when Lord Northcliffe, the founder of The Daily Mail, one suddenly beat a seagull to death with his stick. My first impulse was to rush along the promenade towards him and remonstrate and snatch the gold bloodied stick from his grasp and give him a taste of his own medicine. But I was stopped in my tracks by what I saw next, as the press barons talked off, no doubt dreaming of fascism, that gathered about the corpse of the seagull, several boffins in white coats, who deposited around it an array of stuffed or wooden see goals and owls. They then withdrew as swiftly as they had appeared and hid behind a seaside ice cream kiosk. From his vantage point, they watched carefully taking out notebooks and pencils and scanners and scopes and meters and gauges, and similar scientific impedimenta. Within seconds, dozens of seagulls came swooping down and hovered over their dead power. The air was loud with the cacophony of their cries. They remained with us for some time, until a municipal seaside dustbin person came along with a shovel and a sack, scoop the bird with the one into the other and took it away to the nearest bird cemetery. I made to follow him, but in order to do so, I had to cross the road. And I did so in Baden Powell fashion, looking neither to right nor left, not out of blank foolishness, but because it is the British way. I've got it in the back from a passing motorcar and spent the next several week in a seaside clinic. I never did visit the grave of the seagull

Frank Key  24:58
and Here is an as I said, Here is another passage. This is from some unfocused thoughts on birds and boats out of print. I can never quite convinced myself that birds are real, that they actually exist. Whether it be a Western scrub Jay or a seagull, or a Starling, or a linate, or any of the teeming multitude of birds, they seem to me as serial creatures from the world of dreams. Now, unlike many people, I have never experienced dreams of flight. Rather, my dreaming, my dreaming self summons forth wagtails and not hatches and Swift's and praten, Coles and others of the teeming multitude of birds, sometimes one at a time, sometimes masked in breathtaking flocks. I see the flapping of their wings and I hear their songs, or do I have a knot rather hallucinatory phantasmagoria flying images extra upon my brain representing what I would be where I'm not bound to this to to solid Earth by my great clumping feet shot in a pair of Austrian Postal Inspectors boots.

Frank Key  26:27
That passage is followed by pages and pages and pages about Dobson's Australian Postal Inspectors, boats, and it really is enormously tedious, so I'm not going to read it to you. Which brings us to the end of this week's show. I hope you've committed the pontiff mnemonic to memory and will therefore be able to recite a list of Pope's should you be asked to do so. And let's hope I don't have to update it again. Too soon. Good job. I wasn't you haven't written it in 1978 when I would have had to update it after just 32 or 33 days, something like that. But instead of babbling on about the papacy, I will say bye bye for this week. Bye bye.
