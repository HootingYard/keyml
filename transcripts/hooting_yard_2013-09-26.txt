Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM, the art of listening to hooting yard on the air. With me, Frank key. This week's show is a mixture of fact and fiction. And the fiction is by someone else. So the good thing is I haven't had to make anything up at all. We've got some facts, and we've got someone else's fiction. Those of you who keep abreast of these things will know that I write a weekly column for the dabbler web blog. Thank you is called the culture blog for connoisseurs of everything. And in the last few weeks, in the dabbler, I've been writing a series of brief lives. The idea of these brief lives is not that you're gonna learn anything really much about the life of the subject, but you'll learn one little nugget of information about the subject, which will be useful for you to if there's a pause in the conversation in the kind of Swish, sophisticated cocktail party to which you get invited on as a sort of awkward silence you can chuck in one of these little paragraphs about various famous and not so famous people and be the cynosure of everyone else in the in the party. So anyway, let's get I'll begin with some of these brief lives then. JOHN Henry Anderson, Scottish magician 1814 to 1874, the first magician to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Anderson also did a trick, which he described as, quote, a grand and the Dexter illogical illusion, with 12 handkerchiefs into which will be introduced the encounter the loaf, and learned bottle, the animated orange, and the invisible pigeon. Unquote. Actually, before moving on to the next life, I've just been wondering about that invisible pigeon. I mean, I could pull an invisible pigeon out of a handkerchief easily, because how would you know whether I had or not if you couldn't see it? Anyway, moving on. Gertrude Atherton, American writer 1857 to 1948 Gertrude avison declined an invitation to meet Oscar Wilde. Having been shown his photograph. She wrote, his mouth covered half his face the most lascivious, course repulsive mouth I had ever seen. I might stand it in a large crowded drawing room, but not in a parlor, eight by eight by three tallow candles. I should feel as if I were under the sea, pursued by some bloated monster of the deep. So Edward Athol Oakley, English wrestler, writer, and organizer of rugged holiday cruises 1900 to 1987. To build up his physique, Athol Oakley followed a regime devised by the john restlichen Schmidt, which involved drinking 11 pints of milk every day. Many years later, hackin Schmidt tells him that the quantity of milk prescribed was a misprint. Clement Attlee, English politician and Prime Minister 1883 to 1967 Attlee took a dim view of his illustrious predecessor, William Glanton. He really was a frightful old prig. He wrote, fancy writing a letter proposing marriage, including a sentence of 140 words all about the Almighty. He was a dreadful person. Incidentally, the sentence from Cranston's letter to his future wife is as follows. This, remember, this is a proposal of marriage

And I'm also sensible that she can find little in me sensible that were you to treat this note as the offspring of as a presumption. I must not be surprised, sensible that the life I invite you to share, even if it be not attended as I trusted will not with peculiar disadvantages of an outward kind, is one, I do not say, an equal tea or dessert. For that we're saying little, but liable at best So, changes and perplexities and pains which, for myself, I contemplate without apprehension, but to which it is perhaps selfishness in the main, with the sense of inward dependence, counteracting an opposite sense of my two real unworthiness, which would make me contribute to expose another and that other. Apparently, the future Mrs. gladsome didn't reply immediately. She wanted some time to work out what the grandson was actually saying. The model for my brief lives is of course john Aubrey, English writer and and tick query 1626 to 1697. If you ever get round to finding a paperback copy of Aubree brief lives, I thoroughly recommend it. It's a marvelous book. But it's a wonder the Aubrey lived long enough to write them. He had an au shortly after he was born, and a grievous au aged three or four. He vomited for 12 hours every fortnight for years. At ait, he had an issue in the coronal suto of my head, which continued running until I was 21. One October, he had a violent fever, and at 15 or 16, the measles, followed by a dangerous fall from his uncle's horse, then smallpox. At 20 he fell and broke a rib and was afraid it might cause them a post cremation. Then he was shipwrecked had a terrible fit of the spleen piles and near fatal Lazio in testicular suits. Soon after, an imposter broke his head. He was attacked with a sword and twice nearly drowned. Also, a drunkard tried to kill him in the street.

Sure, in the conviction that the foot slugger had as much right to the Kings Highway as any motorist if, as a result, he gets it in the back. He dies asserting his right. That is not blank foolishness. That's British. Ambrose bierce American writer 1842 vanished 1913. bs was one of 13 children all of whose given name this began with the letter A his parents, Marcus or really is best.

Now, toddlers in brief lives, and we'll have a few more before the end of the show, but we must turn from fact to fiction. And the other day, for the first time this century, I was reunited with my small collection of Puffin post magazine. For those of you who don't know, Puffin post was a quarterly magazine for tinies book loving tinies published by Puffin books, edited by Kay Webb, who was the ex wife of Ronald So, the cartoonist. Anyway, so Puffin post came out every every three months and for three, three years or so, I got it in the post and was very happy to receive it. And so I was hadn't seen these these magazines for years. And through the circumstances I want to go into I found them in my grubby mitts earlier in the week. So I've been really enjoying looking back through them, and I thought I might find some interesting things to read. And I certainly did because in Volume Two number two, which as I recall is from about 1968. There's a, an absolutely rip roaring story by Janet Aitchison entitled The pirate tale. And as far as I'm concerned, it bears comparison with some of battle Brecht early piratical stories, Brecht wrote a number of stories about pirates. And Janet Aitchison, I think in the pirate style has really done a great job. The interesting thing, of course, is that in 1968, when this story was published, we're told that Janet was five and a half years old. I don't know what became of her, she must now be middle aged like me. But if I'd been able to write this when I was five and a half, if I could write it now, if I could write it now i'd be happy. So I'm going to read you the pirate Tale by Janet Aitchison. And I suppose there's a very, very, very, very, very vague possibility that she might be listening. I hope he is. The Pirates Tale by Janet Aitchison aged five and a half. Once upon a time, there were some bad pirates. They sailed to a mountain. They dug in the mountain and found golden silver. The mountain was a volcano. They saw a bit of volcano. Then they ran back to their ship, and they sailed away to their mountain and hid the golden silver in their cave and guarded the treasure. A dwarf stole a golden silver. The pirate woke up and killed the dwarf. The Pirates got the golden silver and the dwarf golden silver. The King dwarf sent an army to fight the pirates and to hurt the pirates. Who knows which side won the battle the pirates. The Pirates caught the king dwarf and they killed him and they threw him into the sea. A whale threw him up again. And the pirates threw him down again. A shark came along and ate him up. The Pirates laugh to see the dwarf being eaten up by the shark. One day the pirates found a crab. It pinched a pirate. The pirate screamed to see the crab. The Pirates ran away to the ship and sailed to the mountain and got the guns and killed the crab and the Pirates laughed. One day the pirates found a rat and killed it. The Pirates had a cat and the cat ate the rat and the cat died. The Pirates looked sad. a pirate found a house and opened the door and went in. It was dusty. He tied it and dusted it. The pirate found a mouse and gave the mouse a piece of trees. The trees was magic. The pirate said Oh dear, the trees is magic. I shouldn't have given the mouse the trees. The mouse died. One day the pirates found a forest. The forest was bewitched. The Pirates went in the forest. The pirate turned into frogs and leaped about all over the place and croaked trying to talk.

One day the pirates found some children. The Pirates kept the children for their wives to cook for them. The wives to cook nice things for the pirates. The Pirates like the food and ate it all up. The Pirates like the fish Best Buy caught the fish themselves from the sea. One day the pirates weren't very well. The Pirates had mumps. They were very ill. One day the pirates got better and sailed away to the mountain and saw a shark and killed it. And the pirates new cat said meow meow. The pirate said be quiet new cat.

I have decided that a fiver I get a new pet cat. Because I haven't got a cat at the moment. I used to have cats but I haven't got one of them. But if I do get one, I'm going to call it new cat. I do think Be quiet new cat is one of the great lines in all fiction. Sorry. So yes, Janet aitcheson you are a dreaminess and I hope you're still writing. And I thought that was a great story. Great, great story. But anyway, let's get on with some more brief lives. Charles the first British King 1600 to 1649.
