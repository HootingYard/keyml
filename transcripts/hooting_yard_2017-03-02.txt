Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. Live from Bara High Street in London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. And

Frank Key  00:38
yes, so I'm going to read to you for about 28 and a half or 29 minutes. And what I'm going to read to you is material from the hunting yard website, which is hooting yard.org and I recommend going there this is Episode 49.3. Type A one of the most unlikely stars of the golden age of the variety theatre was the monologue is Zoltan jiffy. Is monologues delivered in a booming robotic monotone? When notorious for going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Audience is listened as if spell bound, as he told anecdotes devoid of interest or incident or rhythm or punch lines, or anything remotely worth listening to about topics such as drains and straw and windswept coastal headlands and emus and rotting deer and porches and crumpled paper and tin foil and Kappa kairys and Wells Fargo, and dust and cruise ships and pin cushions, and slime and tofu and mental aberrations and hopelessness and armoires and corporate sponsorship, and the great dismal Maroons and hens and albinos and Greece and tongue twisters and woodland sprites, and goats and bats and caught jesters and plumpness and ostriches and Vainglory and canned fruit and ampersand and driftwood and macadamia nuts, and the kosan one, and balconies and thirst and gravel and designated smoking zones, and vodka and shrimps and antimony and the naming of race horses, and the old rugged cross and the Munich air disaster, and Rumpelstiltskin and shadows and grains and misanthropy and carrots, and podcasts, and squeegee merchant and downs and the lives of the saints and putting things in alphabetical order and dis arranging them so they were no longer in alphabetical order, and rearranging them into quote the usual order, and dis arranging them again, and tracking them all out of the window one by one, and watching as they plummeted to Earth hundreds of feet below, some landing on the unprotected heads of pedestrians, causing injury, and in some cases, death, and then hearing the sirens of both ambulances and police cars, and the thumping of boots on the staircase, and the urgent pounding the door before it was bashed in with main force by a SWAT team, and gristle and pangs and knitting needles and sin, an egg yolks and bolts of cloth and handy artists on the river Nile and shabbiness and gumption and freak and pictures of jack girls in censuses. And you want to know what happened after the SWAT team bashed the door in Sullivan arenas and ink patterns and swamps and sewing circles and spelling bees and bees and castor sugar and swimming pools and Canada and Allegiant slaughter and being placed under arrest and dragged down to the police station and interrogated at length of and donkeys and volcanoes and maps and frost and soup and imps and brooms and figs and den and hedges and ergot poisoning and orchards and swollen rivers and check stubs and ornithology and vinegar. lapis lazuli and supermarkets and boll weevils and champions and mustaches and confessing to the whole kitten caboodle and entering a play of befuddled stupidity, and sandalwood and concussion and drip dry laundry and goblins and chalk and power stations and a pop an X and brutes and gas and genuflection and full stop, full stop. Dammit, I said full stop.

Frank Key  05:32
those in the audience who remained awake could sometimes discern insult and griffeys interminable monologues, scattered snatches of autobiography. He would appear on stage in his top pattern anorak and pantaloons and mountaineering boots, and begin to speak or rather the drone and it would go on and on and on and on and on and on and on, about drugs and clipper ships and monkeys and nobility, and the love that dare not speak its name and overcoats and Periodontology, and scrimshaw and buttered dishes and insignificance and border guards and waste shoots and palimpsests and sharks, and litmus paper, and hods and shelving units, and the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe and target practice and mothballs and sticky buns, and enamel and detergent, and clementines and Pope Joan and fanfare Bernard and distemper, and Graham rolie, polie, and moistness and barbarism, and carpets, and despair, and geese, and plums, and Thunderbirds, and axolotl, when it would all of a sudden say something about arranging large heavy objects into alphabetical order, and then dis arranging them and rearranging them into quote the ual folder, and dis arranging them again, and tossing them one by one out of the high window in a fit of befalling stupidity. And the audience would pick up their ears and listen more carefully as a coherent story promised to emerge from the prattle on Zoltan Griffey would tantalize them by going on to relate the sound of boots stamping hardly up the staircase, and a pounding at the door. And then the door being bashed in, and being taken into custody and interrogated and making a play of befuddlement and stupidity. And then, just as the audience were desperate, but not desperate, let's say mild green trigged in a casual way to find out what happened next, he would revert to babbling in consequentially about tax inspectors and pomposity and grind and card games and rhubarb and Frankish kings and cavemen and ballooning and mistletoe and the Seven Dwarves and cobalt and linctus and marmalade and foreigners and bedstead and cornflakes on partridges and scooters and rabbits, and operatic tenors, on boarding passes and flailing and reprehensible behavior and the smell of cordite on rafts and snow storms and anchors, and bosom comes an eglantine and wait for it. Wait for it time for a full stop. It is thought that what kept the audience's flocking to salt and Jiffy shows was the hope that sooner or later, they would tease from him something true and human, some exciting story of his attack of befuddled stupidity, and the dropping onto the heads of passers by, of large, heavy object and his arrest and interrogation and his plea. And then they hoped, oh, how hard they hoped for the aftermath to be told what happened next. But it's a small mercy that he never did tell them. Having done so, they would have learned that just like the monell August, they too were incarcerated forever in a bleak grim home for the befuddled in the stupid and would remain there for the rest of their lives to spend hour upon hour, day in and day out. Listening to zahlt and Jiffy prattling on and on and on and on and on and on an on and on and on and on and on, and on and on and on and on, and on, and on and on.

Frank Key  10:11
Well that was 10 minutes of your life you won't have again. Yes, so that was the story of Zoltan jiffy. This isn't Shiver me timbers shiver equals quake with cold and fair cold warfare. Me The being that is myself timbers equals planks of wood excuse me I'm going to start again Shiver me timbers shiver equals quake with cold or fear me the being that is myself timbers planks of wood cut to shape from trees. Thus, the prolific pirate or prolix pirate would shout quake with Colgan fear that being that is myself planks of wood cut to shape from trees. But the prolix pirate is what is known in the technical jargon as an unlettered matter lot. And so his prolixity was improvised off the top of his head. He shipmate the even more prolific pirate was armed with a battered old copy of the Oxford English Dictionary. He would shout, tremble, shake quiver, S, to tremble with cold or fear the objective case of the first person pronoun I reproducing the Old English, accusative and dative would use for the building of houses, ships, etc, or for the use of the carpenter joiner, or other artists and wood in general as a material asked after it has been suitably trimmed and squared into logs, or further adapted to constructive uses. You can follow the adventures of the prolix pirates every week in the children's comic the Ipsy Dipsy do prolix edition, available from all good dealers in the newspapers and periodicals. So the owners of shops where these are sold, now also the shop itself, usually also selling tobacco, confectionery, etc.

Let's see the sea vast, wet expanse. I sailed upon it with Captain Hans. Hans was German. He could not swim. He was stricken with a with a limb, an arm or a leg. I remember not. Memories make my brain grow hot. I live in the present by the shore. I live out with the rule of law. My only rules are those of the sea vast wet expanse come Splish Splash me.

Frank Key  13:51
Yes, this is helping you out on the air, as I said, and I hope you're enjoying it. And if you are, remember that our Christmas to set 2016 Christmas appeal lines are still open. So if you'd like to donate to hooting yard, I know you've probably just spent all your money donating to resonance. But you can also donate to hooting yard to keep the show on the road and to keep the wolf from my door. So if you'd like to do that, if you've enjoyed what you've heard over the last 13 years, if you've been listening that long, or even if you've only even if this is a very first time you've listened to the show, please give generously as they say. And meanwhile I'll give you some useful advice which is that Marian various other pitfalls one can face when using swore fieger. You don't need me to tell you that but I'm going to anyway. I shall show you how to anticipate the common pitfalls, how to start how to sidestep them with a certain elegance. Where the pitfalls are gaping chasms that cannot be avoided? How do we emerge from them more or less unscathed? As I say, you probably know all this already, but that won't stop me from telling you if I have time. First though, there's something else I needs master dress. When I've given this talk on previous occasions, whether in village halls or in windswept marquees, there are always one or two people in the audience who think the subject of my talk is swore fieger pit falls, a putative cataract of tumbling water. I came to say, Niagara or Victoria Falls. Often I might be halfway through my talk or even close to its end, when someone in the audience will pop up with a complaint. These networks can become quite hot of head. One fellow insisted on brandishing at me a fat book called, I think, a Gazetteer of the world wettest waterfalls, holding it open, and grabbing his finger repeatedly. What he claimed was a color plate of a mezzotint of small fieger pit falls. Another surgeon and he held off the marmalade jar, emptied of marmalade and now containing water, water, which he shouted, he had personally collected perilously from the seething, roiling, churning, sloshing foot of small finger pitfalls. I usually deal with these interruptions by calmly pointing out that there is no such waterfall and politely suggesting that my hecklers pay closer attention to the typography in my publicity material. This rarely satisfies them. For example, the gadgeteer wielder leaped onto the stage and began something me with the gadgeteer and the mama by john Mann similarly leaped onto the stage, unscrew the lid from the jar. I've pulled the contents over my head, quite ruining my majestic Buffon. The point I'm trying to make is that while there are pitfalls to be faced, when using swore fieger equally, if not more, so. There are pitfalls to be faced, when simply talking about the pitfalls to be faced when using swore fieger. These latter pitfalls can be more alarming. In all my years of using swore fieger For example, I cannot recall a single occasion when having prized the lid off the tin and being ready to dip my hand into the squelchy cleansing agent. I have been set upon by a nincompoop either bashing me with a gazzard tear or pouring a jar of water over my head. It is true that several times by majestic Buffon has been ruined in small finger related circumstances. But I must admit this is always almost always been my own fault by absent mindedly printing my boo for just moments I've been getting my hands covered in swore fieger. Given the number of times my talks are interrupted by people demanding their money back because I'm not talking about a waterfall. Whether or not they physically attack me. It has crossed my mind that perhaps there actually exists a tumbling cataract called war fieger pit falls somewhere in the wide world.

Frank Key  18:40
I have thus employed a gaggle of unpaid interns to fan out across the globe in search of it. They regularly report back to me on their progress. To date, none has found convincing evidence of a waterfall so named more worryingly. One by one, my keen and perky interns fall silent, says I've had to engage a second set of interns to fan out across the globe to track down the original gaggle the reports I received from the second lot make for sobering reading. It appears that in traipsing through far flung places in search of small finger pitfalls. Each of the Pioneer group has fallen into a pit. So Kevin has of these pits near waterfalls that none has ever emerged. They may even have fallen into bottomless pits, riddled with subterranean vitals like the one oshibori ness. Such other pitfalls of unpaid internship with Electra giving talks on the pitfalls faced when using swore fieger. I can't say I didn't warn them. There may be pitfalls I announced breezily for I always like to make my announcement brazenly but even I had no idea How many parallel pits there were in the vicinity of waterfalls? It has come as something of a surprise. The next surprise I'm waiting for is when or if one of my interns manages to avoid the pitfall of falling into a pit and reports back to me the startling news that yes, the ninnies and nincompoops were right all along. And there is in fact, a waterfall called swarf eager pit falls. Should that die Come, I will have no option but to tear up the text of my lecture and start all over again. I will announce breezily many and various of the pitfalls one can face when using small finger. You don't need me to tell you that so I want instead, I will tell you about the pitfalls one can face when searching the globe for that mighty tumbling cataract. small finger pit falls

Frank Key  21:38
after I posted that piece, on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org I got a letter. Dear Mr. Kay, I read with great interest your piece on small finger pitfalls. I myself have often experienced four finger pratfalls. I think it would very be very helpful for your readers and listeners.

Frank Key  22:08
Excuse me, I think it would be very helpful for your readers and listeners. If you can provide a clear, comprehensive and slightly historical explanatory string of paragraphs on the differences between pitfalls and pratfalls. Should you require my assistance in this matter? I'm available for interview at the corner table in our ma popsicles tea shop every day between the crack of dawn and the engulfing shroud of pitch black starless night. The letter was unsigned, but my correspondence is diluted in thinking that there is such a thing as a small finger pratfall. He or she is obviously confusing the phrase with small finger Pratt falls, a mighty cataract of tumbling water, which can be found on the outskirts of pointy town. Turn left by the cement statue of happy Drake's and keep going until you hear the roar and slosh of a mighty cataract of tumbling water.

Frank Key  23:32
Assessing the career of the tyrant King Pascal's the eighth, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that he was an excessively dull witted and dim King. There is a plethora of anecdotes from courtiers and palace leakers, revealing that the king was rarely able to answer simple questions such as what part of the body sits atop the neck? How many angels can dance upon the head of a pin? Or who won the 1953 FA Cup Final? And yet this atrocious, ugly, stupid man rolled over a mighty kingdom for many years, his hands steady at the helm, that his mind was do Lally so damn was he was, he has much to teach us about the craft of kingship and indeed of tyranny. If we consider tyranny a craft, for Let there be no doubt that his reign was tyrannical. In the case of capacitors, the eighth wrote the historian sagely sagely, we find a faithful combination of childish whimsy and an inability to string together a coherent sentence. Thus, it was that his hench persons invariably misunderstood his use cases, but hurry to fulfill them come what may. sagely gives. As an example, the occasion when the tyrant kings whim was to burn down rebonding the land, but so muddled and mangled was the manner in which he gave the command that his royal barnburner mistakenly put a pot bellied pig in charge of the palace Treasury instead. As might have been expected, the pigs spent every last golden coin on swell and not a barn was burned to the ground. Fortunately, capacitors to the eighth was so dim that he did not realize what had happened nor why. And he retired his Boudreau to gaze at the ceiling, thinking it was the vault of heaven. One could multiply such Flim Flam until the cows come home. And indeed, there are many amusing and sometimes alarming books, which cobbled together hundreds of instances of capacitors, the eighth imbecility I want to take a slightly different tack. However, the thing that's always fascinated me about the tyrant King is not his breathtaking dimness, but his dinner jacket. Dinner was of supreme importance, the Court of capacitors the eighth, whatever else was going on, at four o'clock sharp every day, the king would sweep into his banqueting Hall and sit down at his banqueting table, which would be gathered all sorts of banqueting companions. In spite of the dim this, the king like to be entertained during dinner by philosophers, scientists, novelists, artists, actors, clowns, jugglers, pamphleteers scrappily, bearded film directors, engineers, podcast maestro's, deep sea divers, chefs, snipers, ornithologist, sundry persons with metal plates in their skulls. magicians mountain is ex Beatles except Ringo, priest, anthropologist cartographers architect mesmerist, and if it was available, Rolf Harris it is doubtful if any of the high flown Table Talk penetrated the Kings doll which is Brian, but he sat there a fork in each hand. He never used a knife, beaming and resplendent in his dinner jacket of the day. There were seven of these jackets one for each day of the week, and the king cut quite a dash in all of them. Monday's was made out of Crimplene, and cardboard with golden stars and ribbons and a coat hanger embedded in it. Tuesday's was a plain burlap sacking adorned with coal dust and grease. Wednesday's was a gorgeous embroidered flapping wonder Thursday's was satin boxy and black. Friday's was net from strands of a rare and stinking wall Shawn from rabid sheep tie dyed like some hippy shawl surrounded by an aura and visible Saturday It was a classic cut, but frayed at the cuffs with dangling bells. Sundays were somehow Arbor as if the king was vibrating or on another plane just beyond human apprehension. Whatever day of the week it was whichever dinner jacket he was wearing. The tyrant King ate sparingly, birdseed and millet mostly accompanied by sips of lukewarm water from the palace spigot. Today, the

Frank Key  28:25
giant dinner jackets can be found hanging in display cases and a jolly little museum hidden away in one of the less salubrious photo bogs of pointy town. I exhort you to pay a visit night repeated visits, study the jacket now caked with dust, hear the echoes of all that banqueting table babbling take away with you a souvenir packet of tyrant kings birdseed, relive the days when capacity is the eighth reigned over us dim and tyrannical and cutting quite a dash. The part of the body atop the Kings neck by the way, was his head.

Frank Key  29:22
And that is the end of this week's show. I hope you enjoyed it. Bye bye.

Frank Key  29:49
Last slide like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans that are nervous and wanted to touch my tears.
