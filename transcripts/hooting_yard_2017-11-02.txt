decide to decide that from now on instead of Hello or a hallway or watcher for you whatever else people use as a greeting. Good morning or good afternoon just p Lu. And this is hooting out on the air. My name is Frankie. I am the mud guard, I guard the mud. And boy, there's an awful lot of mud. It's a full time job. The mud covers a large rectangular area on the outskirts of town, just beyond the duck pond and the viaduct. It's known locally as the muddy field. Though its official name is Plunkett meadow. Nobody living calls it that, but the name is shown on our maps of the area. I patrol the perimeter of the field from dawn till dusk day in, day out, and sometimes at night to, for example, when the regime has declared a state of emergency. At such times, I'm provided with extra supplies of strong black coffee and or cans of fizzy pop infused with chemicals designed to stimulate the nerves. Because of the long hours and because I am the only mud guard, I live on site or as near as dammit, in a hut or chalet slap bang next to the muddy field. It is alas far far from the sea. But I keep on my bookshelf several paperbacks by Herman Melville and Joseph Conrad. They have a briny smell, having been dipped in sea water and dried by sea squalls. My uniform is best described as a blouse and pantaloons, it is a foolish outfit, and often the object of ridicule by wayfaring strangers. To cut a long story short than the mud bureau Chef dafair was a fanatical devotee of Spandau Ballet early in their career. That much is true. I have grown used to the hysterical laughter of passers by a no longer bother to throw pebbles at them. On a typical day, I rise from my palate before dawn ablute eaten eat a slap up breakfast in which sausages play an important part, put on my preposterous uniform, and I'm ready to begin my first patrol as the sun comes up, brave heavy OSS etc, etc. I prance along each side of the muddy field first clockwise, then anti clockwise, keeping an eye out for anybody or anything that might imperil the mud. I then take a break, perched on a storm outside my chalet for five minutes, but remaining vigilant. I then conduct the second patrol of the day, armed with a pointy stick, and so it goes on until nightfall, it is very satisfying work. Once a week I receive a visit from a senior official of the mud Bureau. It is rarely the same official. They go about their business in plain clothes, the only sign of their status being a small lapel badge. This depicts a patch of mud above which hovers a disembodied head. I think this is intended to be a generic human head, but for my money, it bears resting resemblance to Tony Hadley born 1960 the lead singer of Spandau Ballet, the official interrogates me under a glide glide about each patrol of the previous week. I furnished the details using an agreed code in which sausages play an important part. There is then a little break, during which we might chat about Herman Melville and Joseph Conrad. If the official is see brained, or other batters If not, for example, we might talk about stamp collecting or football or the transubstantiation of the host and the Catholic mass in Tudor times. During These discussions that Clyde lighted switched off.

As mud goes the mud garden the muddy field, aka Plunkett Meadow is pretty ordinary mud. I cannot claim to have studied it in any great detail, but as far as I'm able to ascertain, it has no particular features, which would distinguish it from other mud in other muddy fields. If there are any elsewhere in the band site on the other side of town, by the fireworks factory in the hem coops or even further afield, blindly in remote areas, such as the security zone out towards the sea, which sloshes against the shore, where goals creek without wishing to boast, I must say that I'm damn good at my job. To date, I've guarded the mud with resounding success, in that it has not been imperiled in any way by malefactors and ne'er do wells, whose numbers are legion in spite of regular roundups by the secret police. I can say with pride that the mud is safe under my watch, or watch shortly to reach its 40th year of service. I'm looking forward to receiving on the anniversary my commemorative award a gorgeous cummerbund. I am the Mad God. I got the mud

from fiction sort of two fact. The communist regimes of the last century threw up their fair share of monsters, among whom Pol Pot was one of the more demented his Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia in 1976. By the time they were overthrown Three years later, sorry, 1970 was it 1976 or 1975, john Khmer Rouge.

His Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia in sort of the mid 70s. By the time they were overthrown Three years later, in other words, in the late 70s, around a quarter of the population had perished. Pol Pot had a vision of a sort of peasant utopia. Accordingly, towns and cities were emptied, and the people marched out into the countryside to work on collective farms. He had a particular animus towards bourgeois intellectuals, a group which apparently included anybody who wore glasses, of course, surprise, surprise, Pol Pot was such a bourgeois intellectual himself. As a young man he studied in Paris from 1949 to 1953. There is an instructive story from his time in France. Already, the first glimmerings of his agrarian revolution were swirling around in Pol Pot brain, and an associate suggested he ought to get out of Paris and investigate French farming methods in the countryside. Pol Pot, thus headed off deep into rural France, and went to stay uninvited with a dairy farmer. For a couple of days, the future tyrant followed the farmer about observing him at work. This it seemed toward Pol Pot all he needed to know. On the third day, over breakfast, he launched into a Marxist critique of the farmers age old rustic ways. He could he explained all of the cows to do exactly as they were told, just as he would go on to bend the people of Cambodia to His will. The wise old French farmer scoffed. You do not understand, said Pol Pot, never short on self belief. Your cows will obey my every word, for I speak the language of cows. The farmer cackled that the young Cambodian upstart took a last sip of his breakfast brandy and went out to his barn. He opened the doors and the cows mooched off across his field to manage grass. At this point, Pol Pot appeared at his side, he announced that he would make all the cows returned to the barn to sweet simply by issuing a verbal diktat. He then uttered deafening volume, a savage guttural Cambodian cow incantation. To the farmers astonishment, the cows ceased munching looked up and almost uncanny speed, charged across the fields and returned to the barn. It was a classic case of pot calling the cattle back.

I'm afraid to say that John's reaction to that was to groan. As soon as the music came back up, and I don't see why I really don't see why. Anyway. Moving on here is a scientific experiment which will intrigue and entertain everybody from tiny tots to tottering krones you will need to obtain a goodly amount of curd say about the size of a dinner plate divided the curd into two halves by cutting it with a kitchen knife. Or if you're feeling violent, which I know is often the case, simply tear the curd into with your bare hands. A Rama You will now have two lumps of curd where once there was but one Don't worry, that was merely the preliminary, not the experiment itself. Now, you must treat the mumps of curd in very different ways. The first one, let's call it curd a must be kept fresh at all costs. You could for example, wrap it in cling film, which is filmed that clings and put it on a shelf in your refrigerator. Meanwhile, take the other lump of curd and treat it as you would a piece of furniture you wanted to give a fashionable distressed look. You can chuck the curd at the wall, beat it with length of chain, leave it exposed to the elements for a week and so on. At the end of this process, you will have two spectacularly different lumps of curd. The one wrapped in cling film in the refrigerator will be as good as new. Whereas the other one which I forgot to call could be earlier will look old and wretched and like something that cat dragged in. If the cat does indeed drag it in while it's outside exposed to the elements, take it back outside and sculpt the cab. I now want you to take both lumps of curd to the nearest duck pond with all of them you can muster chuck them into the pond or as it might say in the Bible. Cast the curds upon the waters. Now watch in amazement as curd a the fresh Good as new curd floats. While could be the old wretched curd sinks to the bottom. Why does this happen? Well, I'm not going to tell you but one person who knows the answer has written entire an entire book about it. Her name is Maya Angelou and the book as I recall, is entitled I know why the curd sinks.

Daniel Barenboim has won many plaudits for his creation of the West Eastern divan orchestra, bringing together young musicians from different countries in the Middle East to promote the cause of peace. Laudable as his efforts are, several observers have noted that the world of classical music is too small and too narrow, to have real societal heft. Pop music they say is the lingua franca that can genuinely bring people of different faiths together to this end and as a faltering first step. in resolving the simmering civil war between the two major branches of Islam, a new single has been released. It's a new version of I got you, babe by Sunni and Shia.

As john has pointed out, that's an old one. I'm sorry about these terrible, terrible groan worthy pieces. But I went through a little phase, which I hope I hope I'm out of now. And I have the owl call my name was a best seller in the 1970s. I don't know whether it was the early, mid or late 1970s. JOHN, any ideas? No idea. Anyway, do you remember that book? I heard the owl call my name. Now that was brilliant. The our service was brilliant. I heard the outcome My name was well, it was it was one of the best seller for some reason, in the 1970s. Alongside such now neglected titles is Jonathan Livingston, seagull and Zen and the Art of motorcycle maintenance. What all three had in common was a concern with the ultimate meaning of existence, or at least the ultimate meaning of existence, in the specific context of bliss doubt self obsessed, post hippie North America. I actually read the latter two titles in my misguided youth, though, thankfully, I seem to have recovered from the experience with no ill effects. But I never got around to reading. I heard the owl call my name, and that's it continues to intrigue me. Well, not to a debilitating extent. I don't wake up every morning fretting about it, nor have I thought to obtain a copy. What intrigued me is the title. The book was written by Margaret Craven. Now, over the years, I have listened to numberless owls, and not one of them has ever uttered the cry, Margaret Craven, nor any sound remotely akin to it, no matter how strangulated the voice in which we pronounce it in an attempt to mimic an owl. Aha, I hear you say, but I heard the owl call. My name is a novel, is it not? So perhaps the name of the owl calls is that of a fictional narrator, rather than have a non fictional author. This is a persuasive argument until one does a spot of research and discovers that the book concerns a dying Anglican Vicar named Mark Bryan. Again, Mark Bryan is not by any stretch of the imagination. The sort of sound made by me owl has ever been my pleasure to hear as I crunch through the Duff in on the forest floor in the dead of night, my lantern occasionally picking out the fugitive site of a small scurrying mammal, its heart pounding in terror. It is in such a place at such a time, that one is likely to hear owls hooting. We use the automatic, we use the automatic pig word Hoot to represent the call of an owl. Or if we're writing a children's book, we might deploy to wit to rule we will not ever use Margaret Craven or Mark Bryan and if we ever had a dramatic brain and brain government and did so we would befuddle our readers utterly to the point where they would probably toss our book around aside and exasperation and who could blame them for doing so. Now, as I say, I have not read the book. So there is every possibility that perhaps the dying Vicar has a parishioner named Biff, who to Todd two weeks or such several to woo, and it is this person who hears their name called by the owl while crunching through the Duff on the forest floor in the dead of night. Their lantern occasionally picking out the fugitive side of a small scurrying mammal. It's hard pounding in terror. Bear for Todd or so, Trevor. Old Then scampers to the church to tell the vicar of this exciting turn of events and to seek His judicious religious advice on what it might portend in terms of the meaning of existence, only to find the vicar sprawled on the floorboards in front of the altar, dying. Why is he dying? Has he been attacked by owls pecking at him with their beaks and slashing at him with their talons.

owls are more likely to set upon the small scurrying mammals in the nocturnal forest rather than a human Vicar in a candlelit church. So what might account for such a pallava? It could be that rather than being a stereotypical bitty Anglican Vicar, Mark Bryan is an effeminate cross dressing Vicar, who bears a startling resemblance to Tippi Hedren. In this scenario, the owls would simply be attempting to reenact a scene from Alfred Hitchcock documentary, The birds 1963. Or we might posit that on the other side of the forest, there is a sinister military industrial has Chem facility, leakage from which the owls have been exposed to transforming them from common or garden owls to science fiction monster Owls of unbridled savagery his life ebbing away. The victim moans weekly for help, which point before Todd or several comes scampering up the Knave. He cradles Mark Brian's torn and bloody head in his arms and whispers I heard the owl call my name, the vicar's eyelids flutter and his breath rattles? Does he still have strength enough to speak and to reveal his needy parishioner the ultimate meaning of existence? We would hope so. This being a 1970s bestseller. I have the alcohol My name 1967 predates both Jonathan Livingston, seagull, 1970 and Zen and the Art of motorcycle maintenance 1974. Could it be that both Richard Bach and Robert M. pirsig. Were shameless plagiarists is the wisdom in their books lifted wholesale from Margaret Craven, who has the dying Vica vouchsafed to bear for Todd or so Trevor? All what it all means. You say the owl called your name. gasps Mark Bryan is a sign. I understand the language of owls. And I think I know what it would have said next. How do you stay to listen instead of sprinting pell mell out of the forest and through the village and into the church and along the nave to come and cradle me in your arms in my dying moments. Before Todd or so Trevor all dabs Vickers brow with a dampened rag, trying his best to comfort him, desperate to keep him alive long enough that he might impart the wisdom of the owl. You must repair your motorcycle groans Mark Bryan, and you must zoom upon it down to the seaside. There you will find a different form of birdlife seagulls rather than owls. The Seagull will not call your name. It will swoop and scavenge and saw watch it carefully and the dappled sunlight then, but before he can complete the sentence, and thus divulge the ultimate meaning of 1970s existence. The Vicar collapses and dies. I hope this is an adequate summary of a book I have never read. If it isn't damn well to be

I thought I did the show this week as I often do. I was going to say with extracts from further science book 20 by Norman Davis but I forgot to bring that with me. Luckily I do have a copy of Mr. Keys, shorter potted brief, brief lives and exciting hardback which you can still buy in all good book shops. And so I thought I'd read a few selected a few selected lives from the book to fill up the time, and perhaps john will wave at me when time is nearly up. So let's begin with Iggy Pop. American musician real name James Osterberg, born 1947. At the time of recording the classic album raw power with the Stooges in London in 1972, he pops drug of choice was not a heroin, no amphetamines, but Harvey's Bristol creme Sherry. That's entirely true. Also, beginning with P. Edgar Allan Poe, American writer 1809 to 1849 post dying words were Reynolds, Reynolds, Reynolds. He was calling out for Jeremiah Reynolds, an enthusiastic supporter of the Hollow Earth Theory of john cleave Sims. One of the inspirations for the narrative of Arthur golden Pym of Nantucket. Reynolds was not present at Poe's deathbed. And I don't want to be morbid, but I quite like the I think on my deathbed, I quite like the idea of just shouting out Reynolds, Reynolds, Reynolds. It would, if nothing else, it would confuse those listening and jealous, poverty honors Italian scholar and poet 1454 to 1494. So john Hawkins tells us that Polly attack, poverty honors or politan, who passed for the finest wit of his time in Italy, met with a fate which punished his criminal love. Being professor of eloquence of Florence, he unhappily, he unhappily, became enamored of one of his young scholars, who was of an illustrious family, but whom he could neither corrupt by his great presence, nor by the force of his eloquence. The vexation he conceived at this disappointment, was so great as to throw him into a burning fever. And in the violence of the fit, he made two couplets of a song upon the subject, upon sorry upon the object with which he was transported, he had no sooner done this, than he raised himself from his bed, took his loot, and a complaint accompanied with his voice in an air so tender and affecting that he expired in singing the second couplet. Terrible fight for a musician really, although it does make me think of another famous lute player sting. Perhaps if sting expired after singing, probably the first completing the song that might be quite useful oath or sting. Where is the death, as an MA memorably wrote in, it's probably in the 1970s. Alastair McCallum MacAlpine English jack of all trades. 1942 to 2014. McAlpine was variously a property developer, political fixer, Paul Farmer, shopkeeper, Art Gallery, owner, writer, and Bed and Breakfast proprietor. The one constant in his life was his love of collecting and he amassed splendid collections of among other things, fine art, medieval African beads, snowdrops and police truncheons. Bye bye
