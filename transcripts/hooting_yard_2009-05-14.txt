Good evening. This is resonance wire 4.4 fm. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air now into its sixth year of broadcasting. I'd like to begin this week by reading an extract from Katniss book of the table by EF Dallas, which was published in 1877. I don't think I've read this on the program before but if I have it so great that you'll enjoy it again anyway. carving, winking the word printed in the year 1508. The Book of curving, some of the words are curious and throw light on the names of deceit dishes, which have been corrupted by process of time, where the meaning is quite plain, the spelling is modernized, but not otherwise. And now the quote from the book of curving the terms of a carver be here following break that dear lash leech leak that Braun, rear that goose lift that swarm source that capen spoil that hen, fresh that chicken unbraced that mallord, unlace that Coney dismember that Heron, display that crane disfigure that peacock unjoined that bitten and cashed that curve you lay that fall and wing that Partridge wing that quail mine that plover sighs that pigeon border that pasty thigh that Woodcock sight all manner small birds, timber, that fire tire that egg trying that salmon string that lamprey splat that pike source that place source that Tench splay that bream side that Haddock task that barbell curl palm that trout, thin that Chauvin tyrosine that eel tranche that sturgeon under tranche that porpoise, tame that crab, Bob that lobster here and us the goodly terms of carving.

So next time you're in your kitchen, don't forget to dismember that Heron. This is a story called the muscular fool, and the other fool. A fool dug a hole in the ground with a spade. When he had dug deep enough, the full put aside the spade and sat down in the hole deep enough in this instance, meaning that from his sitting position, His head was below ground level. The ground itself was fallow, we should remember even if the fool did not that the larks shrill five may come at the daybreak from the fellow. So at least was the assertion of Sir Walter Scott in the Lady of the Lake. He goes on to say that the bitten sound his drum booming from the set g shallow, but there were no shallows, said G or otherwise, in this fellow where the fool sat in a hole he dug no any bitterns to boom, Scott brought a curse upon himself by making disparaging remarks about the Mughal Toni ins in one of his novels. But the fool had not been cursed. He was simply a fool. It is pointless to ask of such a person. Why have you done what you have done? Either he will not reply, or if he does, he will deter your brain with his explanation. You might understand the individual words he shouts or matters at you, but you'll be hard pressed to make any sense of them when you join them together. That's one of the things about fools. They drive a stake through the heart of reason. I used to be a fool, so I know that only two well I was not the kind of fool to dig holes in the ground with my spade for my foolishness led me down other pathways. I could often be found in department stores, wandering from one floor to another via the escalators up and down all day long, never making a purchase, followed about by in house detectives chanting. I mean, the I was chanting not the detectives. The detectives had no time to chart they were too busy keeping track of me. They would have had no trouble tracking the fall with the spade, for he had dug his hole in the ground. And now he was sat in it quite still. The in house department store detectives could have gathered in a ring the rim of the hole and kept their eyes on the fool for hours, but they would not be likely to do so. Being in house types. They did not do any detecting out with the precincts of the department store itself. Not unless one of them went rogue and was overzealous in his duties that had been known to happen, but not on this occasion. thoughts come in all shapes and sizes. The fall in the hole in the fallow was muscular, which ought not be a surprise when you consider that it takes some strength to dig a hole in the ground deep enough to sit in so that one's head is hidden from view. You or I might be panting and shaking after such exertion. But the fall sat in his newly dug hole looking for all the world as if the most energetic thing he had done all day was to stir a spoon in a bowl. That was what he had done first thing before marching across the fallow with a spade over his shoulder. He had poured porridge into a bowl like a bear in a fairy tale, and then stirred it with a spoon and then spoon it bit by bit into his mouth and swallowed it. And then he licked the bowl clean. These were not the actions of a fool by any means. But then most fools have moments even how mornings of lucidity. Yet as soon as he had prepared and eaten a sensible breakfast, the fall reverted to inexplicably foolish behavior and went out and dug a hole and sat in it.

When I was a fool, I usually I too, usually ate a proper breakfast at the start of the day. Though In my case, it was rarely porridge. I have been traumatized by the version of the fairy tale of the Three Bears told to me as a bedtime story by my mom. In Miss Elena mules telling of 1832 it is not Goldilocks who enters the bears cottage while they are out and about, but an ill tempered old woman. When the bears come home, they first tried to burn her, then to drown her before finally chucking her a loft on St. Paul's churchyards steeple upon which he is impaled. Thus, as an infant that was fixed within my little brain, the Association of porridge with impalement and so I became keen on cornflakes. Even at the peak of my foolishness, I sell them set out without a stomach full of Mr. Kellogg's finest. When milk was scarce, as it often was, given the pitiable state of the cows where I grew up, I would just shovel the cornflakes down my gullet straight from the carton. It may be the case that the fall in the hole sometimes had to make do with dry oats for his breakfast if he too experienced problems obtaining uncontaminated milk that would depend upon the cows in his locality, and whether they were hailed or sickly. irrespective of their health, and the possibility or otherwise of their milk. It could happen that a blundering cow might roam into the fallow field and topple into the hole dug by the fool. If the fool was still sitting in his hole, he would find himself underneath a panic stricken and possibly injured cow. Being a muscular fool, he would probably be able to push the cow off him and to climb out of the hole. One might hope that pangs of compassion would burst through his foolishness, at least temporarily, and that he would rush away to find the farmer or a veterinary surgeon, but there can be no guarantee of that. Fools can be so well wrapped up in their own foolishness that their behavior appears ruthless and despicable. So it may be that his hole now being occupied by a cow, the fool would simply retrieve his spade from where he tripped Protect and dig himself a second poll in which once dug he would sit in the fallow, where no bitterns boomed, but locks would fight at daybreak. shrilly if the fall was still sitting in his hole come the dawn, having spent the night under glittering stars, the locks fighting would almost certainly awakened him. Now consider the situation. We've already ascertained that this fool is the sort of fool who thrives on a proper breakfast of porridge. You cannot make porridge while sat in a hole dug in the ground, even if you're a BrainBox rather than a fool. So the fool intent upon his breakfast, would clamber up out of his hole and begin mincing across the field towards wherever it was, he could rely upon the makings of porridge. One can be both muscular, and have the mincing sought whether fool or no. Again, we may hope that the fool's heart would be stirred at the sight of the stricken cow in the adjoining hole. But with a stomach clamoring for porridge, the fool is not likely even to notice the other hole or the cow within it. The cow may bellow but the fool in the extremity of his foolishness will misconstrue the bellowing as something else, as say, the fighting of a mutant Lark or a factory hooter further is a factory over yonder for the making of fireworks and other explosive devices. And its work as a summon that dawn by means of a hooter to a fool's is, all sounds can become confused. On this bright morning as the full minced

on this bright morning as the full minced across the fallow towards his porridge, a carry tricked farmer was in his barn counting his cows. He counted them thrice, just to make sure he was correct in his apprehension that one was missing, and then he resolved to cramp his fields until he found his cow. In the distance, the bells have some bibley big Dibs clanged, and in the fallow the fall and the farmer met the one mincing from the east and the other tramping from the west. The farmer asked the forward if he had seen his cow, the full replied. But as we have seen, those individual words were coherent. They made no sense when joined together. There can be danger when fuddle headedness share space in the brain with a hot temper, and the farmer was hot tempered, as was betrayed by his cherry cheeks. They were cherry because his blood often boiled little things in raged him from misdirected farm postage to creaking wheelbarrows, fretting about his cow and stupefied by the fools response to his simple question. He lashed out at the fall with his big hairy farmers fists, though muscular and quite able to triumph in any fight he got into the fall was disadvantaged by the sudden ferocity of the farmer's onslaught, and he toppled to the ground. In so doing he clunked his head on a large pebble. Miraculously, the clunk caused an injury eaglemont of bits inside his brain, and he became instantly and permanently lucid, and no more a fool when your eye. He jumped to his feet and shook the farmer's hairy hand and pointed to where the cow languished in a hole dug in the fallow and promised the farmer he would help to rescue it. As soon as he had had his breakfast porridge, and away he minced with a clear head and bright eyes. My own transformation from being a fool to no longer being a fool had nothing in common with this tail. I suffered no clunk on the head, nor was I mincing across the fellow was church bells clanged. I had dug no holes in the ground, and there were no cows to be seen. I was in a city far away when my foolishness evaporated, sprawled on a divan, twitching and shattered with a belly full of cornflakes and milk that had I but known it was contaminated. It was the seeding microscopic beings lurking in the milk that borrowed their way up into my brain and nibbled away the weird bits that made me a fool. When their nibbling was done. The tiny tiny beings burrowed through the top of my skull and was smothered by my Buffon. I picked out the dead shriveled things with tweezers and put them in a jar and I put the jar on my mantelpiece and there it stands. It can do no other jars stay put, once you have placed them where you want them. I only learned that lesson when I was no longer a fool.

There are two footnotes to that piece. Early on, I mentioned to Walter Scott in Woodstock or the Cavalier 1826 by Sir Walter Scott, a character named Tonkin's meat to violent end. And Scott regrets that, quote, his brains have not been beaten out in his cradle, unquote. To prevent him growing up into one of those muggle Tony ins. For this, he was cursed by Robert Wallace and Mughal Tony and from his LinkedIn. And the other thing I learned about Sir Walter Scott was that he had one of his, I think it was his great grandfather or his grandfather was known as Beardy, because he had a big beard, like Richard Branson. Anyway, um, in one of one of the pieces that appeared on on the hooting yard website, I'll give you the address yet again, even though you probably know it. www dot hooting yard.org and I mentioned in one of the pieces that was there, an unregistered ice cream van and I was asked by a number of readers to explain in what ways such an ice cream van differs from a registered one. It's all to do with Robbins. Some years ago, an inspector appointed by the regime started to notice the presence of threatening Robin's whenever an ice cream van went barreling along the lanes around Pang Hill and its satellite dire and dirty villages. The more the inspector looked, the more Robin's he saw in the sky upon branches in shrubbery and hedges, atop buildings, and even perched on the power lines that are strung from paling to paling, with no apparent purpose in this gas fueled baileywick when the weedy tinkling of an ice cream van was heard, the number of Robin's seem to double, then triple A, and a sense of menace was made manifest. The inspector passed this information onto an officer back at headquarters, the officer resplendent in furry pelts and hohenzollern cavalry marshals boots, immediately holding as many ice cream van drivers as his agent could pull from their beds at midnight and had them questioned. Have you or has your van ever been attacked by Robin's? This was the gist of all interrogations However, they were phrased the replies contains much dissembling many evasions and outright lies, but that was only to be expected, and the graph on which the results were plotted was adjusted accordingly. And the officer had half a dozen copies of the graph printed in four colors, green and pink and diamonds Scarlet and sent them by pneumatic tube to his superiors. He was commended for his rigor, and awarded yet another medal, this one of 10 circular and expensively beribboned. The committee of six recognizing their own lack of ornithological expertise in panel the birdy Nutter to add weight to their deliberations. He was no Robbins specialist by any means. Being more of a corncrake man. They spent most of his time out in the wilds, living in tree hollows, surviving on berries and water from reels and the first meeting of the committee to decide what to do about the menacing Robin's have to be delayed while he was tracked down. The task of doing so was assigned to a cadet who happened to be a cousin of the original ice cream van investigator. Though cousins they had been reared as brothers as closest twins. The cadets name was Bhim and the investigator was called bam. And they were both friends fanatically loyal to the regime, in spite of the fact that their other cousin shovel him was a treasonous curse, languishing in one of the prison forts on the windswept plains out west. been found the corncrake expert hiding in a forest eating a truck ice cream Hearing birds through a pair of binoculars. They were not Robbins.

There was a deal of difficulty in getting a seventh copy of the graph printed for the Birdman. There was no shortage of colored inks nor of paper, but the regime was faced with terrific transport problems. So many vans have been converted to the vending of ice cream. Despite the Robin's that few vehicles remained abroad for other purposes. ink and paper could not go by rail nor by Coastal paddle steamer due to ancient regulations, none dared overturn. It was after all, that sort of regime. More and more Robin's were gathering in the sky and the trees and between the pilings. It was on the third or fourth day after the empowerment of the committee that the idea of registering the ice cream vans was proposed. The bird person hefty and somewhat disorientated out of his Woods remained unconvinced that Robin's were intelligent, intelligent enough to tell a registered ice cream van from an unregistered one. The person sat is left explained that unregistered ice cream vans would if found upon the lanes and Boulevard be blown up with bazookas. Fewer vans, fewer Robbins. This was the committee's slogan. They have it stamped on items of stationery and tea cups and beakers. As part of a campaign. A protocol was devised whereby ice cream van drivers could apply for registration at post offices and bureaus and vanishing points down grim, horrifying alleyways. This last was picked as a wheeze to do away with the more stupid ice cream van drivers, those whom it was thought may be attracting more than a fair share of the Maleficent Robbins. The birdie panelist was asked to draw up a special report on the meaningful brain activity of both ice cream van drivers and a sample of captured Robin's to find out if there was any correlation. He decamped back to the forest before completing his work, and no search party ever found him. However frantically they crashed through the undergrowth, beating the foliage with sticks. March was left undone that ought to have been done. Yet the registration of ice cream vans remained as an emblematic law as the Robin's gradually dispersed due to the depredations of owls and weasels and monkeys under trained in the shaping of the sky. So the enforcers with their scanners and firearms were removed from the curbside kiosks and unregistered ice cream vans again braved the roads that is how it was.

Finally this week, hi ho hi ho. It's off to work we go. We work at the sludge banks, we monitor and count and then extract from the sludge the flies and gnats and blue bottles, and other insects which have flown flack straight into the sludge and become stuck and died. There is something about the winds here about in their sweep and turbulence that impels the tiny creatures towards the sludge, and once they are near, they're attracted by the palm rising from the sludge, and the stink of corruption and rot and death. The sludge banks lie at the edge of a vast Lake bordering the estuary. We do not actually sing the song of the Seven Dwarves when we go to work. First we are none of us little folk. And second, we know only too well the ruthless and ruinous energy of the Disney corporations legal themes. We witnessed the suicide by bleach blade and plunge of a colleague who was pursued through the courts relentlessly for having named his duck. So when we go off to work at the sludge bank, we do not risk singing that jaunty song as much as we would like to, and much as it would suit us to do so despite our not being of the diminutive persuasion. Instead of saying the sludge banks song was relaxing dwarvish john tennis it gains in intellectual heft the tune we borrowed from Charles Ives, a startling passage from the third movement of the piano trio. For the words we collaborated during a weekend workshop in a wigwam in the woods with smoke pipes and drank copious drafts of understood metal water. And as soon as we'd finished a verse, we danced around a bonfire before resuming our lyrical labors. Or rather say we hopped and flailed around a bonfire. There were 26 verses in the sludge banks song. I shall not tell you a single word of any of them. But we have taken a leaf out of the Disney corporations book and we will recur terrible vengeance on any who pirate or copy or duplicate or cause to be babbled. Or you know what the words of our work song. Hi, ho, hi, ho. And it's off the air I go, because that's the end of this week's hooting yard. Bye bye back next week.
