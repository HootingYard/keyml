Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air with me, Frank K. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour. And I'm going to begin by reading to you about the heft of dough. The heft of dough is the title of an LP recorded towards the end of the last century by agneta and Anna, Fred and Benny and Bjorn alphabetical order, the Scandinavian foursome, we're joined on this occasion by virtuoso glockenspiel list dot tent, who until then was better known as the accompanist of an umpire band devoted to masterpieces of the buraq dot was introduced to agneta unafraid at owl by her brother Rex, tinned the mezzotint hist, who had been commissioned by either Benny or Bjorn to create a mezzotint for the cover of an earlier LP by the Quartet. temperamental Rex completed the work but in a characteristic fit of hysterics destroyed it before it could be used, alleging that it failed to meet the exacting standards he set himself. This is unlikely to be true, and those in the nose suggest it was simply yet another unreasonable tantrum by the talented but tiresome mezzotint. Just feel Excuse me for a moment. I have a frog in my throat and I'm going to turn away from the mic and cough.

His sister possessed a more equable demeanor, and the recording sessions for the heft of doe were notable for their almost uncanny calm. Granted, Benny went postal one afternoon when Anna frid sang her lines, tapioca rather than as score required marmalade, and he threatened to tear her throat out. But it was only that a threat and he was quickly persuaded to go and take a nap. It was Dr. tint, who did the persuading and it was a upon dot tent divan that he napped dot took her divan everywhere, for she was over fond of naps herself. Some said her calmness was closer to narcolepsy. And I suppose it's true that she only ever seemed fully awake when bashing beauty from her glockenspiel. Press interest in the sessions was intense agneta and Anna, Fred and Benny and Bjorn had recently had a hit single, with the prize winning insanely catchy song lepanto the lyrics of which cleverly used the 1571 Battle of lepanto between the holy League and the Ottoman Empire as a metaphor for the more obvious pop pap theme of romantic love. To keep intrusive hacks off limits. All approaches to the recording studios were baited with baffles made of cement. They served a secondary purpose of deterring wreck tint from barging his way in the insufferable mezzotints just declared that he had unfinished business with Benny or possibly Bjorn, and was set upon disrupting the recording of the LP. Frustrated by the baffles, he took to stalking the streets of the nearest Township, cursing and jabbering until distracted at last by a fresh commission for a set of mezzotints. Though this was a ruse contrived by his sister.to label him even further away from the studio. By the time Rex tent discovered he had been fooled, he was holed up in a chalet on the other side of the globe. While agneta and Anna, Fred and Benny and Bjorn and the dot tent were putting the finishing touches to their LP the half of dough is a concept album, in which the five seven use the heft of a ball of dough as a symbol for various historical attempts to measure the weight of the human soul. Perhaps the best known of these are the experiments carried out in the early years of the 20th century, by Duncan MacDougall attending physician at Grove Hall consumptive home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. But Google used an ornate oversized Fairbanks scale designed for weighing commercial silk to weigh his consumptive patients immediately before and after death. reasoning that any perceptible weight loss must be accounted for by the department. of the heaven or hell or purgatory bound soul of the deceased. McDougal was following the lead of the 17th century Padua and physiologist sank Taurus, the founding father of metabolic balance studies, who coined the term insensible perspiration. One has to admire the manner in which Anna fried at our address this material in a deceptively light pop pap format with dots, tense, frantic block and spilling, adding a free song of frantic glockenspiel in the critics were not kind. However, the heft of dough being almost unanimously dismissed as a work of pretentious twaddle. One of the most savage reviews of all was penned by Rex tent under an Anna grammatic pseudonym.

Curiously, Bjorn or it might have been Benny was more forgiving, and he and Rex tinte renewed their friendship, and thereafter spent many a tenebrous Scandinavian dusk sitting together on the rim of a sways dim coats of rabbit for drinking and babbling into the night.

When you go wandering through the bogs in your boots, make sure you do not confuse the elder bog with the younger bugs. It's an easy mistake to make. To the untrained eye the appearance of the bugs is much of a muchness one bug looks much like another. And though you might be able to hold in your memory that there is one bug pretty with swamp parsley, and another bug not. Still, you'll probably come away with a picture in your head of general Bogdan rather than have this bug and that bug clear and discreet. There is an old countryside saying in this countryside anyway, that every bug was once a puddle. If that's true, and reason tells us it probably is, then the puddle that became the elder bog was there long, long ago, before you were born. Imagine that I expect when you were tiny, your parents or your guardian warns you never to stray near the bogs, and particularly not to the elder bog. But now you're grown you can roam at will. You can, if you wish, spend days on end among the bugs. And I have no doubt that you do so. I know I would if I still had the means. But the bust of the bugs was rerouted a couple of years ago, and now it goes to the 10th and the statues and nowhere near the bugs. I was told when I asked that the bus company decided to bypass the bugs, because so few passengers ever wanted to go there than in fact, I was the only person who ever alighted at the bugs. I found that hard to believe. But they showed me paperwork to support their case. I flipped the bus company person took me down with a pop from his security prod and I began to spasm I haven't stopped spasming actually, although nowadays the spasms only come once or twice a week. But I can no longer get safely to the bugs. So now I try at least to hold them in my head. You're lucky you can go to the bugs and stay there for as long as you like. Did you know that all the younger bugs have names? There are no signposts nor placards. The names of the bugs are a bit like that countryside saying known to the countryside persons but to no one else. The bugs are called Lamont Baxter, RF lamb, Sham Beco, caddy, Google boo hoo, Coldplay, maka, Pepe and who dibby das. At least that's what I was told once by a country person. He may have been pulling the wool over my eyes of course, for reasons of his own, but I'm minded to believe what he told me because we were standing on a panel of pewter, and pewter encourages the truth. Apparently, the pewter panel was embedded in the mark close by a bomb. It had been placed there as a source Of Truth platform during the witch trials. Another thing that happened before you were born, the elder Borg and the pewter panel were both there, part of the world into which you drop from your mother's womb. And most of the younger bugs were already there too, except for Baxter and Cuddy, both so knew that even the puzzles they grew from, were not yet there on your birthday. I know that because I questioned your mom, or your power or your guardian, and they confirmed as much you will want to know which of them it was I spoke to, but I'm keeping that under my hat, as is my prerogative and do not for one moment think you can have it otherwise. I shall guide you through the bugs. And my price is silence, at least upon the matter of your mom or power or guardian and what pearls they lead for when speaking to me of you as a tiny. I said to you that you must learn to tell the elder bog from the younger ones, and you will want to know why. The reason is very simple. The elder bog is the only one that's been painted by skilled painters and geniuses. And when you roam around it in your boots, I want you to be aware that you're stepping through great paintings, not just through any old bog, among bogs, bog at dawn, bog at dusk, and shimmer rings, a bog are among

Frank Key  11:28
the masterpieces of art in this country. They hang in the Imperial gallery, and each day thousands far past to gaze upon them with a Jew or so when you stomp about in your big boots. Be aware of what you're stomping through. No artist of repute ever thought it worth painting Lamont or Baxter or maka or any of the other younger bugs. But time and again the elder bog has drawn to it dazzling masters of paint and watercolor and crayon. I'm not sure it's true that as a tourist brochure states, it's the bog most often painted in this land. For I think there may be a bog elsewhere more popular with our painters, as for example for Bogut who've been but only the elder bog has attracted those artists whose names will resound down the ages. Long after you and I are dead. I with my spasms will probably die before you do. And you of course have the advantage of being able to hang around the bugs as long as you like. But do not think you will discover an elixir of life in one of the bugs. I thought that back in the days when the bus still took me there. That's why I kept on going back to the bugs because of what I had read in some out of print pamphlet. That's why I flipped when told the bus would no longer take me there. It felt like a death sentence. I can only envy you skipping along through the bugs, putting up your tent and camping out there for weeks on end. But I pity you too. If you think for one minute that you will find the elec car somewhere among Lamont and Baxter and RF lamb and Sham Beco and Cuddy and goo boo hoo. And Coldplay and maka and Pepe and who dibby das and the elder bog. They're all just bogs and hold no key to eternal life. it grieves me to say that for I used to think I might discover in one of those bogs, something transforming and transfixing. That is why I daily took the bus there for years and years until the bus stop going to the bogs, and instead went to the tents in the statues. Even if I had not been beset by spasms, I would have shunned the tents and statues for what can I learn from them. Everything I know I learned by roaming the bugs. So you would do well to keep alert as you wander in your boots among those bugs while you still can young and feisty and brimming with joie de bogs.

A couple of weeks ago or it may have been last week or a couple of weeks ago, I read a story called Blodgett and troubleshooter. And I've had a few letters from listeners asking me to explain the rules of the board game dentists potting shed, which was mentioned in that piece. Now I hate to disappoint but I simply can't be bothered to write pages and pages about what is after all spectacularly down game. Believe me when I tell you that if I started trying to explain to the beginner how to play dentists potting shed, we would be here all day and probably tomorrow too. And even then we would have got a little further than the first cup gut. And then of course, I'd have to try to explain the meaning of a cup gatt itself, and that's only one of numberless terms a player has to understand before the dice are even thrown. So I'm afraid that on this occasion I'm going to ignore my imploring listeners. If you want to play dentists potting shed go and buy a set and read up on the rules yourself. You might want to wait until next year, however, when a special edition is being released on the sixth of February 2008, who Berman's will have in stock the dentist's potting shed commemorative edition marking the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. This special set will include small plastic figurines of Duncan Edwards, Jeff bent, Liam Whelan, and the other Busby Babes who perished as a result of the crash. The figurines are not an integral part of the board game. So I think the idea is that you can display them on your mantle piece if you have a mantle piece or elsewhere, such as on a shelf. If you do not have a mantle piece, and arrange them so that they appear to be watching the game of dentist's potting shed, you will then proceed to play with your pals. Some may think it eerie to be watched over by footballers ghosts, in which case the figurines can be left to languish in the little thrummed dimity bag provided. Given the complexity and tedium of the game, it's hard to account for its popularity. Last year barges Spinney an international tournament attracted competitors from as far away as the port of tongs and tickets to watch the final sold out within seconds. The tickets themselves have become collector's items. And I have to say that they're very beautiful as tickets go. cardboard and beige and cut just so I've managed to amass six so far as unholy cost one from a beekeeping acquaintance, one abandoned in a nest of thorns, one sold to me by a ragamuffin one stuck to a decoyed duck in a pond, one I suspect to be a forgery, and one I found being used as a bookmark in a second hand copy of Dobson's pamphlet, what planet does Jeanette Winterson live on? I did not go to the dentist potting shed tournament myself, partly because as I have made clear, I find the game unremittingly boring, but partly because I'm terrified of ever going near bulges spinny again, it's almost three years to the day that last I lumbered towards the spinny. And still I shudder every time I recall the gigantic hobgoblins that jumped down from the trees and pursued me all the way back to blister lane. They were not only gigantic but crumpled and toothless and stained with vinegar and covered in arrowroot biscuit crumbs and sweat. Should you ever find yourself being chased away from a spinny or a cop's by hobgoblins prey. It's not the one who chased me on that grim November day. Although I didn't go to the tournament, I read every single press report I could find. I was less interested in the board game than in the possibility that the hobgoblins would disrupt things, scattering the dice and counters and cards and terrifying the players. But no matter how thoroughly I scoured the papers, I discovered nothing hobgoblin related, I could only assume that they had clambered back up into the trees and remained hidden in leafage, allowing the dentist's potting shed tournament to play itself out in the wind and the rain.

Frank Key  19:14
I was perplexed by this until I read the following spring. a lengthy article in the bulletin of bodgers spinny hobgoblin behavioral studies written by an academic panjandrum, which explained everything in pro so crisp, it took my breath away. If you want to read it to look out for the issue with the bulletin with a picture of Celine Dion on the cover. I mentioned that I obtained one of my six tickets by buying it from a ragamuffin what you might think was a ragamuffin doing in possession of such a prized piece of beautifully cut beige cardboard. I was certainly tempted to assume that the nipper had pickpocketed it. He was tiny and bony and as skinny as possible. cleaner and it was easy to imagine him skittering on capturable through busy city streets dipping and snatching was I committing a crime by paying the ragamuffin for stolen goods. I did not like to think of myself as a fence, and I remained troubled. Until a week after the exchange had taken place. I tracked him to the traveling circus of which he was an unlikely veteran. I learned that from the age of just five months, he had been known as howler monkey boy, and that his Daredevil acrobatics, performed without a safety harness were famed throughout the circus world. ragamuffin he may have been, but he was no thief. He explained to me that one of his colleagues, a mustachioed nincompoop known as the human pencil sharpener, was a besotted devotee of dentists potting shed had attended the tournament when the circus was in camped nearby in screwin hunahpu and had given the ticket to the ragamuffin as a birthday present. satisfied by this tale, relieved that I was not a fence. I stayed around to watch that evening circus performance. It was bloody fantastic, especially howler monkey boy himself at his antics, I gasped. I even got to have one of my own pencils sharpened by the human pencil sharpener, whose teeth marks can still be seen upon it, for I have not written with it since instead, keeping it in a little tin display crate on my mantle piece for I have a mantle piece. If next year, I succumb to the fad and by the special edition of dentists potting shed, I may have to move the tin crate to make room for the Busby Babes figurines. That will be a quandary, but I'll deal with it as best I can. What I might do is to obtain a wooden panel and nail it up as a sort of mantle piece extension. It would not look pretty, but it would create more display space and who knows what further baubles and giggles I will want to add as the years pass. And the years will pass of course. And I'm glad of that. For as each year passes. I hope and pray that the memory of the budget spinny hobgoblins. pursuing me across the field will one day begin to fade and that there will come a time when I might sleep through the night without waking in terror shuttering and screaming and scaring the Wits out of my cat Jeffrey? For I will consider my cat Jeffrey.

Frank Key  23:43
For I will consider my cat Jeffrey is of course, a lion from Drew bellatti agno by Christopher smart. I do suggest reading that poem, preferably out loud on a daily basis. You can find it. You can find an edition of it online. If you go to the hooting yard website. www dot hooting yard.org under the heading that cat, you'll find a link to Juba latte agno what a superpower it is. I've just read one line. Let silvanus rejoice with the Blackfish Oliver Cromwell himself was the murder in the mask for the voice is always for infinite good, which he strives to impede. And it's about 100 pages long. And there are plans afoot for a reading of the entire work to be broadcast on resonance at some point in the near future. I hope that we can go ahead with that. What else Meanwhile, Regular listeners know that my grasp of matters ornithological is second to none. So it's only fitting that I've been asked to compile an anthology of fictional works with the word owl in the title. It might be argued that such a task is purely bibliographical and requires no specialist ornithological knowledge. But I will defend my ramparts as one last in this world of rascals and cutthroats and people who claim to know rather more about birds than I do. I'm used by now to lippy slanderers who accuse me of almost fathomless bird ignorance. And though I've been known to qualen sob, I try my best to turn my big cardigan back on my detractors, and just get on with the job. So I'm pleased to announce that work on the anthology is almost complete. One of the works I turned up and one that I'm annoyed about and want to take issue with today is Margaret Cravens. 1967 best seller. I heard the owl call my name. Now Really? Granted, it's a work of fiction. But when did you ever hear an owl Hoot Margaret Craven Margaret Craven. That's simply not the kind of call an hour makes and to pretend otherwise is to be living in a fool's paradise. Of course, as a fiction here, Ms. Craven has the right to bend the world to her whim. And I'm not asking for blinkered storage, but there are limits to what the reader will accept. And before you start arguing that may be the name the owl calls is not that of the author, but that of her protagonist. Bear in mind in that case, that the owl is calling out the name Brian, I think you will agree that's equally as idiotic and approximation of an owl sound as Margaret Craven. I heard the owl call. My name became a best seller some years after its initial publication in the early 1970s. Alongside such empty headed slop as Jonathan Livingston, seagull and Zen and the Art of motorcycle maintenance. Coincidentally, my other current project is a wholesale rewriting of the latter entitled Roman Catholicism and the art of boosterjet pack maintenance, in which the narrator is a futuristic science fiction Jesuit priest, whether it will sell as ludicrous a number of copies as Robert M piercings, mystic drivel is another matter. That's nearly the end of hooting out on the air for this week. And before I go on, I just wanted to mention, do a sort of advert for a new TV series. tank or shutter is bloated frame hoeve interview from behind the barn.
