This is resonance one on 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. Last week I read you episodes 123 of the adventures of mod. A CAD attempted to get more to come into the garden, but she refused. And she was then interrupted by a person from porlock, who came calling, who then revealed himself to be Beelzebub. The devil incarnate using a clever stratagem mod. had him bound with chains and taken down to the kitchen. Now read on or listen on, as it were. This is the adventures of mod Episode Four. Greetings, my name is Beelzebub, and I am the devil incarnate. You may have seen pictures of me color plates in books or crude engravings in religious tract, where I'm often depicted with a goatee appearance with horns and cloven hooves and a tail. The accompanying texts attribute to me all sorts of dark powers and give the impression that I am to be feared more than anything else in the world. All I can say is that such powers, such powers such fear, if real would come in. I'm going to start that sentence again. All I can say is that such powers such fear, if real would come in extremely handy in my current predicament. For the past six months, I have been held captive in the basement of a bungalow by a neurasthenic Victorian lady named Maude, and her slovenly, yet devoted maid servant Baines. The latter is my chief tormentor, for the length of chain which restrains me keeps me confined to the kitchen, and the scullery and the pantry, where Baines rules the roost when she is in particularly vindictive mood, Baynes likes to poke at me with burning hot toasting forks, tattling that she is giving me a taste of my own medicine. I have no idea what she to what she is inferring. As I have never once in my life poked anybody with a burning hot toasting fork. Oh, except for the occasional sinner who richly deserved such hot poking on account of their crimes and not illnesses and debauchery and malfeasance, which they committed before they were delivered into my care. I on the other hand, get poked with burning hot toasting forked purely for Benz's amusement, which seems to turn the moral order on its head. But what can I do? I mean, chained below stairs, forced to work as a skimpy I suspect things would not be half so awful where there's not a Victorian kitchen. The sheer amount of work involved in cooking and cleaning is exhausting even to think about. I have spent entire days scrubbing the grease from pot using hard brown soap and soda and boiling water. And as soon as I'm done, Baines comes a clattering with another load of caked and filthy kitchenware. Down here in the basement, there is no window to look out upon the world and pressure so there's little ventilation, so the air is foul with fumes and smoke. Baynes taunts me and says I must feel at home. But again, I have no idea what she's talking about. The Infernal realm from which I hail is like a child play pen in comparison. Things started out so well. On the way to my appointment with mod I stopped off in the little village of porlock on the Somerset coast, where I poisoned a couple of wells introduced an amusing new bacillus into the cow's milk and blasted an orchard with firebolt. At the end, where I stayed, I joined the other guests in rustic sing songs and games of shelf hatefully before casting them into the pit, it has slipped my mind, but I might even poked one or two of the more inebriated peasants with a burning hot toasting fork, as Bane suggests when dawn broke on The fateful day I was sweeping Kippur and tucked into a breakfast of awful and hot coals.

transporting myself from the in in poor locked and Ward's doorstep in a single bound with 1000 times the leaping power of Spring Heeled drac I hammered my fist on her door. When she opened it, I was struck by her fragility and neurasthenia and power. And I intuited that she had not long awoken from an opium days, occasioned by a goodly dose of laudanum. But of course, I was far too polite to mention it, maybe announcing that I was a person from porlock Come on business, which was more or less the truth, sunlight, capital, but it would have been more honest to say I was Beelzebub, the devil incarnate come to strike a bargain whereby mod would sell me her sold in exchange for Well, for whatever it was she wanted in the mortal world. By the looks of her, she would probably have been happy with oodles more laudanum. But long experience has taught me that honest, though such a direct approach may be, it is less than helpful when deployed with neurasthenic Victorian ladies pray to hysteria and attacks of the vapors. Much better to proceed gently to inveigle one's way into their parlor and accept refreshments in the form of tea and cucumber sandwiches before addressing the main business. But I made the foolish foolish mistake of taking off my Homburg hat, thus exposing the 666 tattooed on my scalp, and the hint of devils homes. chained in the cellar in the smoke up to my elbows in Greece and boiling water, awaiting the next poke from Baines is burning hot toasting fork. I have replayed that policy over and over again in my goatee head as if it were a clip from a horror film. I should have kept the tarot cards in my pocket, and my homberg on my head, at least until such time as the slovenly head devoted maid servant had awoken from our own laudanum days and serve the tea and cucumber sandwiches. I should have used the time to allow mod into my competence to gaze at her with my hypnotic goatee eyes to compliment her on her pre-raphaelite tresses. And the decor of her parlor, the showing napery gleaming silver glittering glass in the center of the table in a vase that had a mirror for its base. white flowers always in bloom, arranged around the edge of the mirror, in a clever contrivance that held water was a border of blue or violet flowers, tall graceful jugs and goblets of bohemian and Venetian glass held iced and plain water, lemonade, soda water, etc. Some oranges were in an old blue and white delf dish to her right. On the left a glass dish held tamales. A silver toast rack stood well filled before her a tiny found in played over some carefully picked watercress is keeping them fresh, raw and cooked fruits were arranged with an eye to color in various old China dishes about the table. Madam, I should have said you must surely have attended carefully to the modern housewife or how we live now by Mrs. Penda cudlipp 1883. I commend you. But fool, fool, I revealed my devilry too soon, and was out with it and bounding trains. And when Baines I woke dragged down into the basement and enslaved as a Skippy My only solace is that I have devised a plan of escape. Tomorrow, Baines has decreed that I shall cook breakfast. Nobody, she asserts, could better prepare deviled kidneys for the devil himself. I agree. And if I have my way, the kidneys are not the only things that will be deviled tomorrow morning.

Deus that Google Bains. As you can see, I am slumped on the chaise long list was an elevated taking dainty sips from a china cup of what I'm given to understand was given to one the sound Irish cousins called a test saying of a morning. It is morning, is it not? Oftentimes, My nerves are so shattered that I have not the foggiest idea what time it is that you nod your head would suggest it is indeed morning. If that was a nod and not one of those involuntary spasms to which you are praying when the effect of the opmi wearing off in the morning. Why in the name of heaven? Are you not down in the kitchen in the basement preparing breakfast? I took the liberty mom of handing breakfast preparation duties today to the devil incarnate who you will recall is chained up downstairs and he's acting as my Skippy and help meet. Oh, yes, of course. It slipped my mind for a moment that Beelzebub came here by way of poor luck and I out wicked him. My was an exciting day that was and he is still here. But of course he is for the trains that bind him a stout and iron and used to belong to my dear departed grandpa. I remember that good leave somewhat rancorous patriarch dangling me on his knee when I was butter tiny taught and telling me that not the devil himself could break free from those chains. It seems he was correct in that, even if much else he told me during those dazzlings I later discovered to be the most errant piffle. Did you know Baynes that the ancient Greeks were colorblind? No mom. Well, of course they were not. I give it to you as an example of grandpa pal piffle. He got it. I think from Mr. Gladstone's three volume studies on Homer and the Homeric age. Have you read it Baines? No, mom. No, of course you have not for you are lower class. It would surprise me if you could read at all. In any case, when would you have time to read what we've all we're skimming and Google dusting and scrubbing and polishing and cooking and cleaning and fire lighting and blacking and stitching and darling and so forth, to which God has so ordered things that you and your kind must devote every waking hour. It occurs to me that you are in the extraordinary position of having the devil incarnate to lighten your burden. I wonder if I'm failing as a mistress by neglecting to give you further duties to fill the empty hours or minutes which BLT Bob's captive presence must have afforded you. That won't be necessary mom, for I have been taking the opportunity to give vent to my inner life. What wild talk is this? past me those invigorating smelling salt veins. I fear I might quite wound away. If it pleases you, Mom I speak the truth ever since you and I dragged Beelzebub down into the basement and chained in there and I have persuaded him to be of assistance to me on pain of being poked with burning hot toasting forks. He is proved of great worth as a skimpy facet moments of unaccustomed leisure. For example, while holding the toasting Forks Over the fire until we're burning hot, the better to poke the devil with. I have given free rein to wild imaginings and other fruits of the inner life. Only the other day Mom, I got it into my head that the pots or pans that the cutlery was the crockery that the soap was the shoe polish. I turned the world topsy turvy, inside my head. No good will come of this Bains I wonder if I ought to summon Dr. slop, the mesmerist who has recently moved into the bungalow next door, he would place your head in a vise and make strangely significant passing movements of his hand. And soon enough, you would be back to your normal self and no longer pray to such miseries. As the company of the devil has roared. Forgive my impertinence mom, but I feel you misunderstand me. I experienced naught but in measurable joy for my flights of fancy and nourishment of my inner life.

Frank Key  16:23
That is perplexing to be sure beans. I still think it would be best to have Dr. slop. Take a look at you. It says there is not another man in Europe who knows more about the unfathomable nooks and crannies of the feminine brain. And I'm sure it would be quite a novelty for him to probe the inner workings of a feminine brain of the lower orders as you wish mom but Hawk from the depths of the basement I hear the Dean of infernal shrieking. That is Beelzebub mom, announcing that he has finished cooking breakfast. I suppose I must eat for I am at the point of physical as well as mental collapse. Would you happen to know what toothsome delights the devil has cooked up for me this morning? You will be having devil kidneys mom. Then I shall stagger as best I'm able towards the breakfast table and take my seat pains. Very good mom.

I'm gonna move straight on to episode six of the adventures of mod

Frank Key  18:23
with my report of the events of the 14th inst if I'm required at few at a future date, to give similar accounts of the 14th out on the 14th procs I will be happy to oblige. present circumstances permitting. My name is Dr. slop, and I am a mesmerist duly certified as such, bother worthy fellowship of Victorian mesmerist on the morning of the 14th inst I received a summons to the bungalow adjoining the bungalow of which I had recently taken possession. I was given to understand that the maid servant of the bungalow, one Bains of slovenly, yet devoted to disposition had taken leave of her senses, and was giving vent to her in a life in spite of being a person of the lower orders. In a matter of such urgency, I dispense with the social niceties, and I swept with a LAN and the steely determination out of doors without wearing a hat. Upon opening the gate of the adjoining bungalow and proceeding along the garden path, I was disconcerted to encounter a CAD. The CAD began to explain that his dearest wish was to entice the lady of the bungalow into the garden, and could I assist in persuading her. I kept him short with a clean, gentlemanly thrust of my fist into his windpipe. a ploy I learned when serving overseas in the tropics, where it saved my bacon on more than one occasion. The cat collapsed upon the garden path, and will not I won't pester the lady for some time to come. My ears were offended by his unmanly gasping and gurgling noises. So before continuing to the front door, I kicked him in the head several times. I wrapped upon the door of the bungalow with great urgency, whereupon I was ushered in signed by inside by a Sullivan I took to be the maid servant vanes before I had the opportunity to place her head in a vise and make strangely significant passing movements of my hands. In order to mesmerize her. Her mistress cried weakly to me from the breakfast parlor, she insisted that I join her for a breakfast of deviled kidneys before dealing with the patient. My own preference has always been for kedgeree bloaters and raw liver as the first meal of the day. And indeed, I had already eaten double helpings of all and had additional portions tucked in my pocket in case of sudden practitioners, but one does not refuse a breakfast invitation from a neurasthenia lady. So I sat at the table with her untapped my napkin under my chin. While I waited for Baines to pile my hate plate Hi. The lady who I was given to understand had already eaten one deviled kidney began to rock back and forth on her chair. Her pallid face blushed Crimson pre-raphaelite tresses stood stiffly on end, as if she were attached to one of those newfangled electromagnetic machines, and she began to declaim incomprehensible gibberish in a grating and disturbingly masculine voice. This was no mere Attack of the vapors. I leaped up from my chair, and was about to place the lady's head in a vise and make strangely significant passing movements of my hands over her. When Baines behind me, dropped the plate and clutched at my arm. Before I was able to berate her for the unseemly and socially reprehensible nature of her action. She gibberd something incapable of understanding her strangulated lower class vows. I slapped her several times across the face, then several more times, and demanded that she speak slowly and clearly and in the best approximation she could manage of civilized human speech. I must commend her efforts for by listening closely, I learned that in all likelihood, the lady's alarmingly unladylike plight was due to some malign tampering with the devil kidneys, which had been prepared by a person from poor luck, who was the devil incarnate, and who was chained up downstairs in the basement, where he had been acting as a Skippy but today had been recklessly entrusted with cooking the breakfast. A prize of this information,

I tossed the maidservants Penny as one might to a performing monkey. I proceeded with Erlang and steely determination down to the basement to confront the fiend. The Sullivan had spoken the truth, for there he was read and horned and cloven, hooved and goatee, I was about to place his head in a vise and make strangely significant passing movements of my hands over him when something quite unprecedented happened. Nothing in all my experience, not even when I was serving overseas in the tropics, and was regularly subject to all sorts of weird and mind numbing Duda was anything like this. One moment, I was taking a quick bite out of a bloater from my pocket prepper Krita maneuvering the vise into position. The next I was chained and read and horndon cloven hooved and goatee and gazing back at myself. I or he had not even swallowed the mouthful of bloater somehow the person from porlock the devil incarnate had exchange bodies with me in an instant. I watched in horror as they proceeded up the stairs with Erlang and steely determination bent on who knows what Maleficent purpose I rattled my chains and wept. Thus far I have nothing further to report so loud as the steam hits through the pipes in this basement kitchen, that I cannot hear anything of what is transpiring. Upstairs. I must wait for Baynes I do not know for how long. My only solace is that the length of my train is sufficient to allow me unhindered access to the pantry, where there are handsome supplies of kedgeree and bloaters. Andrew,

I'd like to be able to promise you episodes seven, eight and nine of the adventures more next week, but I haven't written them yet. And I'm not sure if I will. I have I had written episodes 126 we'll see what happens. I might have to leave you in suspense for some while nearly the end of this week show but as ever these days. Before we go, I'll read you a couple of shorter potted brief brief lives from Mr. Keys, shorter potted brief, brief lives book newly published by constable which I recommend that you go out and buy or even click on your your computer and by on your computer. It's lots of very short bits and bobs about all sorts of famous people. Julie Felix, for example, be American folk singer, born 1938

Ronald furbank English novelist 1886 to 1926 I'd like to read in its entirety. Chapter 20. of Fairbanks novel inclinations from 1916 this is it chapter 20 of that novel, info Mabel Mabel Mabel, Mabel, Mabel, Mabel, Mabel, Mabel. And right, same with Let's end this week's show with sir john Franklin, the English explorer 1786 to 1847. In search of the Northwest Passage, Franklin ships the aerobus and terror became trapped in ice and the expedition set out across the Canadian Arctic on foot. They left their guns behind on the ships, but among the items they carried with them, were a set of monogrammed silver cutlery, a backgammon board, a cigar case, a closed brush, a tin of button polish, and a copy of the vicar of Wakefield. Every member of the party perished. hardly surprising given that they were trekking across the frozen wastes with such a collection of rubbish. I'm going to go and track across the icy wastes now. Or am I Anyway, I'll be back next week with more of the same stuff. And do come to the do come to yarders tomorrow night, if you're in London, or in Peckham, and I'll read some stuff there in public to an enthusiastic audience. Bye bye
