Greetings listeners, you're listening to resonance FM on 104 point four FM, or online. And this strangely is hooting yard on the air. Mr. Key has been spending some time at the distressed home for orphans this week, so I volunteered to read a few of his finer details for you. He may or may not make an appearance but we'll see what happens. I'd like to begin today with at the coffin makers. It is by all accounts lovely and elegant and varnished the coffin in which I shall rot in time to come. I chose it in a whimsical mood from a photographic brochure at the coffin makers workshop which I had entered distractedly mistaking it for a pie and pastry shop. I cannot claim this was a simple error to which any hundred Japanese might be prone for not only are the exterior is of the coffin makers, and the pie and pastry shop, radically distinct from one another, but they lie in completely different parts of the town, the one that the eastern edge, and the other slotted in a parade in the precinct to the southwest. It could with justice be said that I was not all there that morning. I could lay my paramour or the posty or the weather, but to do so in any of those cases would be churlish and incontinent. Well, perhaps the weather, hailstones pinging down in June Who would have thought it my equanimity was disturbed, as it seems, were the readings on my compass. For there I was to the east rather than the Southwest, and all be flummoxed. So there were several coffin makers busy in the workshop, most of them engaged in sawing and hammering and sanding and planing and hewing and chiseling. One was set at a desk writing attract denouncing cremations and ashes and urns. I have since read it thoroughly, and it makes a convincing argument without betraying the base personal motives of its author. It was this chap who, looking up from his scribbling introduced himself to me and asked me what it was I wanted. He gave his name as Ned the coffin maker. In spite of my befuddlement, I had already realized I was not in the pie and pastry shop. So I managed not to make a fool of myself. But I was rather Tongue Tied all the same. And all I managed to say in reply was Hello there, Ned. There followed a confusing five minutes where net the coffin maker mistook me for a long lost pal of his who had run away to see or possibly to join a circus many years before. Apparently, I looked startlingly similar to this fled companion, at least to how Ned imagined he might look after the passage of so many years, grayer and stooped and very will be wrinkled and riddled with liver spots. He assumed to the bunch of chrysanthemums I was carrying was a gift for him, snatched it from me, and plunged it into a jug full of water. When we eventually escaped from my muddle, with the realization that I was not after all his pal, I felt too embarrassed to ask for my flowers back, and indeed, net the coffin maker made no offer to return them to me. I was poised to leave the workshop there and then that is to say I had maneuvered my body so that my toes and nose were pointed in the direction of the doorway. My left arm was out flung to sweep me fully around without my overbalance thing, which is already risk with me quite honestly. And I was in the process of shifting my glance away from Ned the coffin makers characterful And strangely enormous head. But then he piped up, waving his pictorial brochure at me as he did so. Your death is horribly inevitable. It is best to be prepared. I replaced myself facing him squarely on you would be wise, he continued to live through this pictorial brochure of coffins, and pick out the one you will want when the dread day occurs, as fate decrees it must.

Unknown Speaker  05:45
I heard the bell clang then, but whether it was a real Bell or fancy to clanging inside my head, I did not know. But I felt impelled to sit down at Ned, the coffin makers desk. And while he said about chivvying along his colleagues or underlings, I pored over hundreds of pages of color photographs of coffins. Some were shabby, some garish, most were wooden, but a few seemed made of tin or zinc or wolfrum. Their shapes and sizes did not vary by much, and each coffin had been photographed in front of an identical map of Switzerland, tacked upon a bass colored board to give a consistent sense of scale. There were many many pins stuck in that map, one for each graveyard in the whole of Switzerland. The coffins were named rather than numbered, according to captions hand written beneath them. I rejected out of hand for dismal the alarming and the frankly unspeakable. For poppers I dallied over the pinch of flask, the egg on Sheila and the stubby. But as soon as my eyes lit upon the lovely and elegant and varnished, I knew it was the coffin for me. I slammed shut the brochure, and I called to Ned, who came lurching over to me having donned a black cape like a shroud. An excellent choice, if I may say so, he said, when I showed him the one I had picked. His voice was newly sepulchral, as if he spoke from a deep, dank, grim and fettered grave. He explained that he would make all the necessary arrangements when the time came. And for me not to worry my ditzy little head about anything forevermore. I could have taken umbrage at Dead Sea and smashed my fist into his golf, but I reflected that, after all, the only reason I was in the workshop at all was my earlier befuddlement. I said my farewells, and thought I heard mischievous chuckling from the other coffin makers. As I stepped out the door. I threw my compass into a hedgerow, and instead of heading home, I decided to run away to see or to join a circus. I would see which I came to first, the booming ocean ocean with a big top.

Unknown Speaker  09:04
Regular listeners to hooting yard will know that we have a fondness for real people and mentioning real people. And so my second choice this evening for you is variation on a theme of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I caught this morning morning's minion with a combination of cunning in human patients, and a big net weighted with baffles. I lay in wait from before dawn, behind an heiress primed by a flask of vitamin enhance well, Joe, from which I took regular slurps. Then as morning broke, as the kingdom of daylight, stofan came prancing into the room, carrying a breakfast tray. I pounced, leaping out from behind the heiress shouting and chucking the net over him. He dropped the tray and flailed and screeched Depo dawn drawn, and I bashed him on the bonds with a brick and dragged him off to my lair elsewhere in the castle. Later in the morning my father the king randomly ran me to ground in the pantry, my heart in hiding scoffing cake. He was in a filthy temper because, of course, he had had no breakfast. That was why he came barging into the pantry he was hoping to forage for to some treats among the leftovers. at the side of me, however, his hunger was suppressed by a great eruption of rage, unworthy princeling. he roared, preening milk SOP, rancorous violet. He continued with this tirade of insults for some time, his kingly boom growing louder and louder, so loud that the tins on the pantry shelves began to wobble and clutter. Whether it is because of my twisted spine, my slobbering or my pointy little head, my father harbors the conviction that I am unfit to succeed him on the throne of his shabby kingdom. Blind tonight brute beauty and valor and act Oh air pride plume he has been plotting to do away with me, enlisting the help of his minions, mornings, one and afternoons one and evening one, Freeman, Hardy and Willis that he has no other heir, nor is likely to spawn one in his ancient dotage, does not seem to have occurred to him. I in turn was plotting against the minions. Having nabbed Freeman at first light, I plan to entrap Hardy and Willis by similar means in the coming hours. Once I had the three of them safely imprisoned in my layer, I could move on to the next stage of the plot, the what that might be had not yet formed in my brain, both buzzing and pulsating, and rather too big for my abnormally tiny head. For the time being, I simply stood there, twisted and hunched and scoffing cake, as my father heaped imprecations upon me in the pantry, and the tins on the shelves clattered and shook until one fell to the floor. And as it hit the tiles, I saw the metal buckle, and a fire broke from it, then a billion times told lovelier, more dangerous than my father's temper. The place that broke from the buckle tin of compressed reconstituted snack time meat substitute, was so surprising it even shut my father up. He stopped shouting, and looked at it with all and terror in his eyes. The fire quickly burned down to blue beak embers. I kicked the charred tin across the pantry floor with my clubfoot, and I snapped my fingers. On my dear, I said to Papa, fall God goal yourself and gash gold, vermilion, and I left the words hanging and hobbled out of the pantry, stuffed with cake to waylay hardy afternoons minion as he came on duty.

Scenes from the lives of the great composers Franz Liszt. It is a Thursday afternoon in Rome, in a house on the Via del boat bobino Princess carolyne von seine vidkun Steen is sitting at her eska duar scribbling furiously, a tensorrt Abbe enters the room. But not just any concert Abbey. It is Princess Carolyn's lover, the famous composer Franz Liszt, darling she cries Yes, sweetie it is I shouts list impassioned. As you can see, I have crumbled in the face of your energetic persuasions. This very day, Cardinal hohenlohe has shaved my scalp admitted me into Holy Orders. That is wonderful news cries the princess her bosom heaving. Indeed it is replys list, we must go out and celebrate. Suddenly the princesses countenance takes on a look at deep religious solemnity, and she pouts. I am afraid that that will not be possible, darling. She murmurs for I have decided to retreat into a state of seclusion, such that if I live for another 27 years, I shall leave this house only once for a period of 24 hours. Really asks list nonplussed really replies the princess. And what on earth are you going to do with yourself sweetie cooped up in here for the best part of three decades until you are felled by a case of the dropsy? The princess gestures towards the pages and pages of scribblings on her escrito her you know how gregoria says I fairly sputter spirituality. Well, I will devote my time to my book, interior causes of the exterior weakness of the church which by the time I finish it, probably just days before I die, will run I expect to 24 ponderous volumes. Well, you know best sweetie says list. In that case, I may pop back to Weimar for a bit. I'm a bit worried that my granddaughter may one day become engaged to a man with the ominous sounding name sowed. Cheerio then darling, says the princess. And don't forget to write me an enormous number of letters. Oh, I shall, sweetie and they shall often be hysterical in tone. Alas, to attend to quotation from those letters would be like proffering a spoonful of brine and saying here is an idea of the ocean. Mr. Keys indebted to the love affairs of great musicians, Volume Two, chapter one, by Rupert Hughes 1903.

Let's move on, shall we to an inquiry into the death of Virginia Woolf. On the eighth of March 1941, Virginia Woolf wrote in her journal, I think it is true that one gains a certain hold on sausage and Haddock by writing them down. The neuro scenic novelists choice of words suggests that she was not quite sure about this. I think it is true rather than it is true or more assuredly, Now, listen here lumpen proles because I won't say it again. One gains a certain hold on sausage and Haddock by writing them down. Is it pertinent to that before the month of March was out, wolf did away with herself by probably plunging into the river ooze, her pockets crammed with stones, which she led to her watery and at least partly because she was not entirely sure in her mind that writing down sausage and Haddock genuinely helped her to grasp a sausage and the Haddock. I decided to test the idea a month shy of the 70th 70th anniversary by setting up a camping store on the banks of the ooze armed with paper and pencil. As a precaution, I did not fill my pockets with stones. Indeed, I went further donning a life jacket and slipping a rubber ring stolen from kaleido about my waist in A pocket of the life jacket I stole the whistle so that if need be I could pop it loudly and repeatedly to summon help. gritting my teeth and jetting my jar. I took my pencil and wrote the possibly fateful words on a sheet of paper, sausage, Haddock and I waited. I rested my hands, palms uppermost on my knees, hoping to grasp a sausage in one hand and a hammock in the other. If they did not appear, would I feel compelled to plunge into the US? Well, readers, I sat it out for upwards of three hours before rain began to fall in England. There was a sign neither of sausage nor of how thick, but not crucially, but nor crucially, had I any compulsion to fling myself into the ooze. I therefore conclude that Virginia Woolf had other things on her poor battered mind on the day of her death, not sausage, not Haddock.

Given that you're listening to someone with an American accent today, I thought it might be useful for me to read a small play to you. Mr. Key isn't known for his plays, but he does have moments and this is certainly one of them. This is the monkey house incident. Scene one. The monkey house at Central Park Zoo, New York. On the 16th of November 1906. a foreign gent and a respectable lady are standing by the cage of Naco, the monkey foreign gent Good morning, Madam, respectable lady, turning to look at him. Why, sir, you are likened to a sun god. Your light obliterates your surroundings. But do you always keep your hands in your overcoat pocket when addressing a respectable lady? The foreign gent moves towards the respectable lady and annoys her or possibly not. Enter the New York cop. New York cop to the foreign gent. I've had my eye on you, chum. You're under arrest. Naco the monkey looks on, while monkeying about in his cage. Seem to the police cells later that day. The foreign gent is weeping loudly. inter Heinrich Conrad, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera for ingenta still weeping. Thank heavens you have Carlton. Heinrich calm right. Don't you worry about a thing. I have posted bail. Do you think for one minute I would allow Enrico Caruso, the finest Italian tenor of the mall to languish in prison. Scene three the courtroom A week later. prosecuting counsel. Tell us what happened officer. New York cop. This foreign Jen was annoying several women and girls in full view of Naco, the monkey and the monkey house. He has slits in the pockets of his overcoats and Rico Caruso that is not nako prosecuting counsel. It is because of the crowd of moral perverts and dogs and kurz out there in the courtroom who come here to listen Mothers and our sisters are not safe in the streets, they cannot go about without being subjected to insult by this scum from the lazaretto of Naples. Judge to the foreign gent, who is indeed the famous tenor Enrico Caruso Guilty as charged. I find you $10 seen for the fire station later. Alfred m downs thinking aloud. This monkey house incident and the subsequent legal pallava has stirred public interest in Naco the monkey he may have been one of the monkeys kept as mascots by the fire department until their disruptive antics meant they had to be removed to the zoo. I think I will take advantage of the brouhaha and write a book. I'll call it firefighters and their pets. It should be ready for publication by next year. curtain.

Unknown Speaker  26:39
Hello, this is Mr. K. I'd like to thank pansy cradle drew for reading a lot of stuff to you. The she chose things that are actually factually correct or what stuff about Enrico Caruso at the zoo and list, having his head shaved so he could become an eBay and his power more spending three and not three decades cooped up in a single place and reading, writing writing a 24 one in theological work. I also the stuff about Virginia Woolf. The quotation from her diary is true. And so thanks very much Pandu she's ready to read something else.

Unknown Speaker  27:32
Well, I just wanted to add one final thing and that was to ask listeners to look out for the Parvo phone. This is a new product on the market and maybe at a shop or online at a store near you soon. Good. Good tip for Black Friday. The purple phone was human constructed by outer Spaceman and incorporates an iPod preloaded with an extraordinary amount of hooting yard stories declaimed by Mr. Key, as originally broadcast on resonance 104 point four FM. I'll leave you with that this evening. And thank Mr. Key both for giving me the opportunity to read and also for spending a few minutes speaking to you himself. And I hope that he'll be back end fighting fit with you next week for more hooting yard on the air. I think that's it from us or nearly it, and we'll play you out with a Caucasian lullaby. Bye bye.

Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers who wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of
