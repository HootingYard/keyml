Good evening. This is resonance one I 4.4 FM resonance fm.com with this hooting yard on the air, my name is Frank key. It's the 27th of February, which reminds me that this time last year, I was on my way on an all expenses paid trip to New York. I had been briefly been taken up by the art community, and very exciting. I went to read some of my stuff at a gathering of wealthy art patrons in New York City. Put up in a hotel and all while it's very exciting, alas, those days have gone. never hear anything from the art community anymore. And back to my usual drudgery and obscurity, but never mind. It was nice while it lasted. And I'm very grateful for the people who made it possible for me to do that. Very nice. While I was in New York, of course, I made sure that I went to Central Park to Strawberry Fields to see Yoko's memorial to her dead husband. And there were several young people were weeping, which I found quite interesting. I'm sure none of some of them they looked young enough that they weren't even alive when when Mr. Ono was assassinated. But anyway, I don't know why I'm babbling on about that. Much more interesting would be to read a news clipping from the Times newspaper. And this, this this piece of news appeared in The Times on the ninth of may 1854. An accident the consequences of which are expected to be fatal, took place at Cannes on Sunday last year, mature dead flesh shall have nice had announced his intention of making an ascent in a balloon. And two gentlemen, Mercia hardy of Cannes, and Misha de saw a literary man from Paris, had made arrangements to accompany him. These two gentlemen had taken their seats in the car, Mercia plush and not having yet entered it. When some person in the crowd anxious to see the balloon start, cried, let go. The man who held the ropes, thinking that the order had come from the aeronaut obeyed, and the balloon rose rapidly into the clouds and disappeared, Mercia Hardy, and Mercia de saw are both entirely ignorant of the management of a balloon, and it is feared that they have been carried out to see up to the second no intelligence have been received of them.

What kind of become of Mercia Hardy and Mercia Dessau. Luckily we have the Journal of Mercia. disor I literally gent from Paris. And this is what it says 27th of April 1854. faffing about aimlessly wondering how to celebrate tomorrow's feast day of St. Louis. Mary green. You're the mont-fort 1673 to 1716. As luck would have it, I bumped into a vague acquaintance, Mr. Hardy, who said he was making a balloon ascent tomorrow, and would I care to join him? I replied, that I would very much like To do so 28th of April 1854. I met with Mr. Hardy as arranged in a field on the outskirts of Cannes. Beyond some pilings lay Vash we're moving. we ignored them and clambered into the basket or car of the balloon. Shortly afterwards, responding to a call from someone in the crowd of spectators who had gathered the cap, holding the ropes, let them go, and we began our ascent. I noted that hardy looked somewhat disconcerted, and asked him why. We have begun our ascent prematurely, he replied. The arrow Norte, who was meant to be with us had not yet clambered aboard, on myself. I'm entirely ignorant of the management of a balloon. What about you? Is that something you know of? Not a sausage, I replied. As we rose through the clouds below, the earth disappeared from view. It seemed we were in a proper pickle. But an arrow nautical pickle did not quite explain the expression on Monsieur Hardy's countenance. Were disconcert meant had now been replaced by abject terror. deploying the interrogation techniques I had learned as chef didn't trigger for the French Postal Service. I questioned him closely. Hardy turned out to be a muggle Tony and, and as such, he believed that when we got six miles up, we would crash into the sky. I shot him by the lapels, and slapped him around the chops in an attempt and knocks and sentenced him, had curled up in a pitiable ball on the floor of the basket, weeping. Considering him a hopeless case, I busied myself by making an inventory of the basket. There was a handheld rather, a fan, a packet of biscuits, five bottles of champagne, a barometer, and an illustrated album of bird engravings. The air was growing thinner, as we continued our ascent. I said a prayer, asking St. Louis, asking St. Louis Murray green yonder Montford to intercede on our behalf, and then I took a refreshing nap. When I woke were much much higher, and Hardy was no longer curled up on the floor. He was standing, leaning against the side of the basket, gazing out at the boundless firmament. I snapped my fingers in front of his face

but got no response. Instantly, I realized that he had suffered a complete mental collapse. We must have passed the six mile mark, I reasoned, and not crashed into a solid sky. That's utterly destroying the Mughal Tony and concept of the cosmos. Hardy's brain had lost its moorings and he could not comprehend the inexplicably new world we had entered. Luckily for both of us, I could I cracked open a bottle of champagne. onwards to the moon I cried 29th of April 1854. Hardy seemed a little more composed today. I have been running through some of the theological difficulties with him and giving him the opportunity to use my rosary beads. I explained that the Mary olive tree of St. Louis Marie green yonder month Fort Knox Mughal Tony anism into a cocked hat. The air around us is thinner still, and no longer blue but black and shimmering with stars. To my surprise, there are still one or two birds flitting around, though not ones I recognize, nor are they depicted in the album of engravings. Indeed, the only reason I call them birds is because they have wings. Come to think of it. They may be some form of high flying insect hardly suggests they are angels. He may be right. There is one bottle of champagne left and a couple of biscuits 30th of April 1854. As I suspected, we are heading straight For the moon, after two days of continuous ascent, it is a curious feeling to be descending. Hardy has made a grand recovery by he though he will not let go of the rosary beads and thumped me on the windpipe when I foolishly attempted to retrieve them from his grasp. When I was able to speak again, I told him to prepare himself for our moon landing. Hold on to your hat, I cried. 10 minutes later, we settled gently on the lunar surface. It was all very exciting. We both peered into the distance, and was surprised to see a little trail of dust clouds heading towards us. On closer inspection, we saw the billows of dust were caused by the footsteps of a man or we supposed an angel, or a moon being. But no, it was a man after all. What are you doing here? He said, as he reached the basket. His accent was American. He was rather diminutive and wavy. With a little mustache, Allah haunted look in his eyes. Greetings, good fellow. I said. I am Monsieur de saw a literary man from Paris. And this is my vague acquaintance, Monsieur Hardy and Mughal Tony and recently converted to Roman Catholicism, who has developed a fanatical devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. As you can see, we arrived here by hot air balloon. As did I said, the American five years ago, and I too am a literary man, I am also neurasthenic. And I do not wish to teeter over the edge into full blown insanity, by having to deal with you to please leave me alone. You were a prickly little fellow, to be sure, I said. prickly I may be, but at least when I have written a sense by hot air balloon to the moon, and similar tales of unlikely adventure, I have taken care to be as scientifically accurate as the present state of knowledge like possible you strike me if I may say so. As the kind of literary gentleman who takes no such care with your narrative. Even if you disguise it as a factual journey of event, it would not surprise me if you roundly ignored all claims of credibility. I fear you are correct, I said, and Mercia Hardy and I will leave you to your own devices. We shall once more ascend in our hot air balloon that we are both entirely ignorant of its management and go forth wherever it takes us.

Frank Key  12:52
As an afterthought, I offered him our remaining bottle of champagne as a parting gift. No thank you. He said, one drop of a hat stuff and I stagger around as if in the advanced stages of inebriation it one may or rather unseemly reputation by the time I left the planet Earth in 1849. Well, good luck to you, sir, I said, and Hardy and I ascended once more bound fam knows where

Frank Key  13:47
you might have recognized the man the American man on the moon. Pen portrayed of Edgar Allan Poe, weedy neurasthenic, little mustache haunted look in his eyes. It's true that he had a reputation as a hopeless drunk. But it's also true that apparently he could barely drink more than a sip or two of sherry, before it kind of completely ravaged his brain. So he didn't actually drink very much, but when he did, he was a bit of a caution. I never tire of repeating. Edgar Allan Poe's last words, which I'm sure I've mentioned on the show before but I will though again, the reported last words of Edgar Allan Poe was he laid dying at the age of just 49 and possibly 48 were rattles Reynolds, Reynolds. He was calling for Jeremiah Reynolds who was a fellow enthusiasts for the theories of john cleave Sims who believed that there was a hole at the North Pole. And if you went down into the hole you entered the inner Hollow Earth, where there was a new civilization, or old civilization that lived in inside the earth, that we didn't know that but were more intelligent than us. And both Poe and Reynolds were great. Great believers in this, but no one's ever found since this whole even to this day. Here's something else entirely. Detective Captain Ford Maddox unstrap not Taub was not related either to the right of Ford Madox Ford 1873 to 1939 nauta his grandfather, the painter Ford Madox brown 1821 to 1893 Ford Madox Ford was born Ford Herman hypha went by the name Ford Maddox wafer, and in 1919, decided to ditch the Haifa because in the aftermath of the Great War, it sounded to German casting around for a new surname. He didn't book far and simply repeated the foreword. Similarly, there came a point when Ford Madox unstrap, Donald Taub decided to get rid of the unstrap nodes tab, allegedly because it sounded too foolish and including a replacement went for Maddox. So he became known as Ford Maddox.

Frank Key  16:57
I have tried to discover if there are if there are any notable persons named Madox Ford Maddox or Madox Ford Ford, but so far without success, nor have I found anybody called Ford maddix green or Ford maddix black or Ford Maddox, followed by any other color of the spectrum on will turn up eventually is that I'm sure as a detective Captain with a clutch of exciting cases under his belt, Ford Maddox unstrap Donald Taub had a vast amount of paperwork to do. When he changed his name to Ford Maddox Maddox. He had to go back over all his old case files in the basements of several different police stations, crossing out, unstrap not Taub and inserting Maddox. This was in the days before liquid paper correction fluid, where it could been invented by the mother of the monkey Mike Nesmith. So the detective Captain had to scratch out the unscrambled towel with a sharp pointy blade without actually getting a hole in the paper. And then gingerly right Maddox in the resulting off white space. How much easier the job would have been had liquid paper, or its rival tip x been invented. Incidentally, there are those who claim Mike Nesmith mother invented tip x. But that was a separate innovation devised by Wolfgang dabish. In Germany dabish was not related to any monkey liquid paper was invented in 1951. And tip x in 1959. Quite what the difference between these two product is, I have no idea so that one is American and the other European. Nor do I know Betty Nesmith Graham and Wolfgang dabish as a met at some kind of correction fluid summit. Have they done so it would certainly have been a clash of the titans. I must do further research on this particular point. And if I get nowhere, just make something up in review of fact. Before leaving this absolutely fascinating topic and getting back to our main business of the day, which is Ford Maddox unstrap Donald Taub, aka Ford Maddox Maddox. It's worth noting that dabish is a splendid surname for an inventor of correction fluid, given that you sort of dab the stuff carefully onto the paper, or at least you used to, in the days when we used typewriters, rather than the new fangled Space Age computers. Of course, some writers stick loyally to their typewriters, and some indeed even more loyally to pens and pencils. For all I know there may even be writers who still use goose quills. I've been tempted to do so myself. well written not that the logistics of creating a daily blog from scratch the goose quill manuscripts seem so fearfully complicated. I apologize by the way for using the word logistics. It's one of those words much favored by the kinds of people who like nothing more than to obfuscate and to make simple tasks sound complex, coupled with solutions, it's even more horrifying. I have to say if I saw a van passing with Ford Maddox logistics solutions emblazoned on its side. I would be very tempted to scribble down the telephone number or email address for future reference. A few paragraphs ago we left detective Captain Ford Maddox on strugnell tab. Now Ford Maddox Maddox, in the basement of one among any number of police stations, altering old case files, scratching out unstrap nod towel and inserting Maddox. Now admittedly, this is not the most exciting of scenes, even Tip Top writers like frizzy haired Jeanette Winterson and that equally frizzy haired trap. What's his name? Oh, yes. Sebastian Faulks would be hard pressed to make something of it. grunting detective in basement armed with sharp pointy thing scratching away.

Frank Key  21:43
I suppose one could introduce a thrilling time travel element where a being from the future suddenly materializes behind the detective captain. unstrap nada, Taub stroke, Maddox spins around a look of astonishment on his chops. The being from the future tells him to be not a feared the way angels doing Bible stories, but then assures the detective Captain he is not an angel. I am merely a being from the future. He says 1969 sorry, 1960 to be precise. And in that future, do you know what we no longer need to scratch out writing with sharp pointy blades for we have something called correction fluid look. And the being takes from one pocket a bottle of liquid paper and from another pocket a bottle of tip x and says not only do we have correction fluid, we have two different types. One is American and this is called liquid paper and the other is German and called tip x. Ford Maddox and strobe nod Taub aka Ford Maddox Maddox is gug allied. He reached out his hand to take one or both of the bottles. But the being pops them back into his pockets and slaps the detective captain's hands away. Sorry, but I cannot let you use them. Were you to do so. an anomaly would be created in the space time continuum that could have cataclysmic world shattering effects on the very fabric of the universe. And with that, he D materializes, leaving the detective captain, once again alone in the basement of a shabby Provincial Police Station. Be that Jeanette Winterson and Sebastian folks with your frizzy hair and Oxbridge backgrounds and publishing contract and Mr. Key softly and suddenly vanishes away in search of a bottle of ink and a goose quill.

Frank Key  24:36
A piece which by twists and turns is on the same theme actually. Somewhere in the Bible. I can't remember where is a question? Is there no balm in Gilead? Gad? It's a good question. Is there no balm in Gilead is there no physician there is a chemist shop shot As the clinic been boarded up, why does the ambulance have Gilly adsit rusted in a locked and bolted garriage it siren broken and its tires punctured flat. What happened to all that balm anyway? Was it stolen by a ruthless gang of aromatic resin smugglers? Did the gang abduct the physician as part of the plan? with the local television station prompted to show celebrity bombing ghillie ads sniffer dog challenge? Did the masked bloodhounds and their perma tanned owners fail to find even the mirror trace of resin? Did the gang succeed in carting off all the bomb in Delhi add to their mounting layer? What are we to make of the conjecture in the press that the physicians abduction was a piece of fakery? And that he was the mastermind behind the plot? How long did it take for a hack on the daily shackle to dub the affair bombing Gilly AND gate? Will there ever again be bombing Gilly ad? Who is the young whippersnapper who has arrived announcing himself as the replacement physician? Is there something reproachful and oily about his manner? Why does he keep referring to the missing bomas gum or treacle? Is he unable to spell treacle? Or is he up to something? Why does he refuse to divulge the recipe for the bandage pace to use it? Is he in league with his predecessor and with his predecessors alleged gang? Is there any connection between the fact that the new oily physician has put posters up all over the place promising to rid the populace of evil humors and that malign bile ad is an anagram of bombing ghillie ad? What on earth is that stuff? The new physician smears on his hair? Must it Pong so offensively has he no shame? If you know the answers to any of these questions, or can assess the Gilly ad medical authorities in any way, please write to the bounding Gilly ad appeal care of detective Captain Ford Maddox unstrap naads Taub aka detective Captain Ford, Maddox, Maddox.

Frank Key  27:53
And I think that's quite enough to be going on with for this week, but I'll leave you with this thought. Piece of rustic wisdom, which I heard this morning on farming today on BBC Radio four. If we inherited our dreams, from the things we eat, we'd all look like chickens and carrots, and bees, and things like that. Bye bye.
