Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air in Surrey to skid you lamb quizzo good faqih and boom Cognos gas ratty, odem. That's what you'd see if you went to the Vatican City and put your cash point card into the ATM or cash point machine in the Vatican City because it's in Latin. Isn't that superb? I was going to do the whole of this week's show in our last year in translation, but unfortunately, I didn't prepare the material. So maybe another week might be another week the whole thing will be in Latin. Anyway. I've received a number of letters from listeners asking me to give some amount of all some, I'm going to start again. I'm going to have a sip of tea and begin again.

Okay, sitting comfortably. I have received a number of letters from listeners asking me to give some account of old farmer frack it's true that he was a mad old man, probably due to a god poisoning. But he could be surprisingly lucid too. For a time he employed a professional voice coach more used to working with Thespians to help him develop exciting new rules and bellows. His cows were much given to bellowing an old farmer frac wanted to be able to bellow back in a way they would understand. The Voice coach was satnav gob gag Sian of the Bulgarian aeroplane manufacturing dynasty, whose huge hangers on the outskirts of Plovdiv, with a site of tremendous aeronautical innovation during the interwar years. satnav was a great disappointment to his parents and grandparents and great grandparents. For Despite receiving a first class education in the kinds of things that would make anyone fit to head an aeroplane building business. He turned his back on the family firm and devoted himself to the questionable career questionable in Bulgaria at that time anyway, of drilling drama struck Mr. And Mrs. In the art of projecting their voices be they dulcet or stentorian It has been said that no one took to the stage of the Plovdiv theatrical in the middle years of the last century, who had not learned this stuff from satnav. gob gag exiled after the war to the country where old farmer frac herded his tubercular cows, and by now gray and stooped and often covered in crumbs and dust, Sat Nav gob gag fetched up at a ruined hotel on the seafront at CAC. He was only 34 but look to be twice that age such had been his privations. It is well worth avoiding such privations if one can, but Sat Nav did not have the benefit of hindsight. cast off without a penny by the GABA gag clan, a company that in his exile by his pet, coot. Sat Nav was on the point of starvation went into his hotel one day wondered old farmer frack question. What was the Mad old man doing? They're so far away from his cows. Answer. He was in CAC to collect bags of sand and stopped in at the hotel for a greasy breakfast, for he was fond of greasy breakfast, but back at the farm usually made do with a kitchen dish of cow feed. Question for what purpose? Did old farmer frac need bags of sand from the beach at CAC? Answer to forestall or avert the flooding of his bombs. The parent struck up a conversation in the breakfast room of the hotel, and of what did they speak this ill matched Judo? Why they chatted away about the single topic that was convulsing the citizenry of CAC in those dark days, namely, the invasion of an army of killer more hands, which was sweeping through the town in wave after wave of destructive mayhem. satnavs poor coot was cooped up in his hotel room for its own protection. And the panelists voice coach was frantic with fear. What would happen to it when as must surely soon happen? He and his coot were tossed out It is for non payment. he reckoned without the lackadaisical approach of a hotel manager Grimes, who affected a foppish disregard for such niceties as money, so long as his chef cooked up a greasy breakfast, and there were petunias in the plant pot. Grimes was happy to lean against the wall in the lobby, flicking ash onto the tiles from the Norwegian cigars he had specially flown in. By coincidence, his smokes arrived once a month on an aircraft of gob ngag manufacturer.

old farmer frack was temperamentally blind to any animals except his cows. So his brain was perplexed by this talk of more hens. He kept trying to change the subject without success. After a while, he sat back in a daze hypnotized by his companions, mellifluous, fluting high pitched, jabbering booming ostinato, silky whispers and impeccable diction for Sat Nav was deploying all of his vocal talents in describing the terrible sight of 1000 murderers, more hens tramping relentlessly towards the shopping arcade. It was when he made a noise like a cow. That old farmer frac sprang out of his seat, grabbed him roughly by the collar and demanded that he repeat his bovine bellowing. Shortly thereafter, a deal was struck between the two men sat nav gob gag fixed his coot, and his poultry luggage from his room, and a company don't farm a frack aboard his cart, as they crumbled off along meandering lanes to the farm. Within days, the Mad old fool was having rewarding conversations with his cows. He bellowed then, and they bellowed back, as he herded them from field to field. Purposely slowly through all hours of the day and night. His voice coach reclined on a rickety sofa, improving his English with a thorough reading of Dobson pamphlets, while his coot clashed happily in farmer fracks Pond. The ideal could not last one autumnal day when fallen leaves from the pub and trees were so one autumnal day when fallen leaves from the pecan trees so clogged the pond that the coop stayed indoors that came a hammering at the door. old farmer frack was miles away in the furthest of his fields. There were faint bellowing could be heard when the wind died down. The coot still nerve racked from the site through the hotel window of lethal more hands trembled, Sat Nav gob gag dropped his pamphlet. I think it was Dobson's some remarks on the grotesque palette I encountered this morning in my shaving mirror out of print, and strode in his brave Bulgarian way to the door. opening it he was astonished to find grinds the hotelier of CAC florid with rage and somehow deeply threatening in a wind treater the color of custard and a stout pair of Wellington boots. All foppish and has gone, Grimes had come to demand money. So much money in fact, that sat nav pictured himself doing the washing up in the unsavory hotel kitchen for the next 40 years. Question had something happened to Grimes to make him suddenly mindful of the unpaid bills of his hotel guests. Answer Yes, he received a clunk on the head for a piece of falling masonry. Question had he tracked down other past guests or did he have some sort of vendetta against Sat Nav gob gag? Answer, the former Grimes now spent his days on horseback criss crossing the land demanding money with menaces from those who had taken advantage of his formerly lacks manner. Question. What menaces did he threaten? Answer menaces so heinous they are unsuitable for a family radio show. Question. What happened next? Answer. Sat Nav gob gag did the washing up in the unsavory hotel kitchen for the next 40 years. His coot remained on the farm where he visited it every other weekend until it perished. All farmer frack having learned as much bovine bellowing as he needed, continued to be mad and bellowing and his cows bellowed back at him forever and ever. Amen.

The principal function of biblical exegesis wrote Dobson in a jaunty mood one morning is for me to look with disdain upon the minnows who have tried these paths before me. It's hard to know whether the pamphleteer was being deliberately muddled headed with his image of walking minnows. But as I said he was in a jaunty mood, and at such times his prose could be perplexing. There's no doubt, however, about the sincerity of his view that he had an unrivaled grasp of the Bible. He did not write all that much about the holy book, but he never lost an opportunity to pour scorn on scholars of the past, such as Theodore of Matsu estia ludolph of Saxony pelagius terenas of Antwerp Manuel SAR, indeed, more scholars than you could shake a stick at where you minded so to do. Dobson, incidentally was perhaps over fond of shaking a stick at people or things of which he disapproved and attached an infant rattle to one of his sticks, the better to make his point. his point was not always clear, either to him or to the object of his stick shaking, and eventually, he was able to suppress this aspect of his behavior by attending a long course of therapy. In a mountain and mountainous sanatorium where the air was pure, the porridge was playing and the calisthenics were invigorating. The finest of jobs and exercises in biblical scholarship is his pamphlet, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, or were they out of print. The title is a tad puzzling, but not for long, for in the very first sentence, Dobson states's case, I avow, he wrote that there were no Horsemen of the Apocalypse, nor if there had been where they fought in number. In the 60 pages that follow. He argued that a combination of mistranslation forgery and carelessness had altered the original text, so that four should have been two. And horsemen was probably properly English as cows, or possibly bees, challenged by the local papal nuncio after publication as to how two cows or two bees could symbolize famine, war, pestilence and death. Dobson countered with a theological Sally, probably the greatest of his Sally's theological or otherwise. Sadly, there's no record of what he said.

At a jumble sale last week, I was delighted to pick up a bundle of Dennis beer pint poetry books for less than the price of a toffee apple. Well, I say books but these are leaflets really have between four and 12 pages, each printed with a good stettner machine in the early 1970s. Here at hooting yard, we think bear pond is a criminally overlooked diversifier, often subjected to critical moorings, when he'll justly be garlanded with laurels. Much of the material in these forgotten publications sees bear tight finding his voice, and admittedly that voice was still a little shaky at this early stage in his career. I was struck, however, by the old gems such as illness, which begins Oh, how dark the night is when you've got meningitis. And by being a B, with its wonderfully evocative couplet, I do as I do, and I does as I does, and what I do and does is bars I think it's lines like these that fool people into thinking be a pint twee, or a peddler of doggerel. This seems a particularly fatuous accusation when one considers Titanic works of Posey such as lines Upon the death of dag Hammarskjold in a plane crash September 1961. With its vibrant clackety pluck rhythms, massive resonance reach vigor, gargantuan ambition, deliberately blurred vision, not need tremble, mint, sourness decisively windswept atmosphere, implacability, tartness, muscular bounding strides and bravery in confronting head on conundrums of global significance. It ends with this beer pine tea and flourish. Oh, dag arlindo looks ob auto Libertas. I've reserved the Pew at your Requiem Mass. Who else could have written that?

moving swiftly on because of a few little problems with the music and computers and laptops and all the kind of things that bedevil a radio station like resonance is why you love it really. And that's why you're going to give money now to be found to keep resonance alive. Please do donate. Seriously, it's important we're going to vanish not just me, but everyone else you ever listened to here will vanish if we don't come up with the cash. Anyway. Before plunging know before reading this, there's something else I must tell you. I don't often do a walk On guide on hooting yard, but every now and then I come upon something that I find out about and i think you know, more people should know about this. And I'm at Queen Elizabeth hunting lodge in Epping Forest at some point over the next week, and you know, I'm, I haven't really done my homework properly because I can't give you the date and time, but I'm sure you can find it on the web. There's a tutor hat making workshop, and I think, doesn't that sound good, you can make a tutor hat and take it home with you, and it's free of charge you might have to pay for materials. Look up Epping Forest to the hat making workshop on Google. I'm sure you'll find the details. Before plunging into the ocean, snorkelled and flippered or as it may be encased in full body diving gear. It's critically important you're aware of the actual size of the innumerable life forms that team within the vasty deep. If you have read pebble heads best selling paperback, the neurasthenic Aqua person, you will appreciate the force of my argument. In this book, the author plows through a relentless litany of aquatic diving enthusiasts of a nervous disposition, who came a Cropper in the water because they feared an encounter with some monstrous sea being whose picture they had poured over in an album of marine life without having taken care to read a parent's medical addendum to the caption saying actual size or not to scale. For the hearty and the reckless Of course, there is no problem. They will topple off the side of their boat and go happily splashing about in the depths with the same gusto they would take to striding across a wild and desolate more, or tucking into breakfast in a magnificent hotel dining room. But whoa betide the mentally fragile diving person, one who suffers from attacks of the vapors, should they jump into the boiling ocean unprepared. Let's consider an example xo anthesis sociologists. In reality this is a tiny thing, often magnified in reproductions and threatens no peril to the average sized human diver, whether hearty or neurasthenic. Yet the latter those whose brains are given to fuming imaginings based upon anatomical inaccuracy may have understood that these weak creatures are Titanic in size. They may fear being sucked into the zone first sociality is hideous, more helpless and alone. Such timidity in the sea is desperately bad for the moral fiber. pebble head acknowledges that many nerve wracking oceanic explorers will prepare themselves by swallowing a draft of some brain tonic or emboldening potion before clambering into their wetsuit. He condemns this practice, rightly in my view, in prose of towering vigor. There can be no substitute, he writes, for preceding each dive into the squalid black depths of the oceans with untold hours of study of the actual size of thousands, Nay, millions of grotesque life forms that populate those very same squalid black depths into which the neurasthenic Aqua person is due to plunge. Some cynics have pointed out that pebble head has a vested interest. He owns the rights to a patented mechanism by which the prospective diving person is able to stand before a full length mirror and watch as one after another actual size images of numberless sea beings are

Frank Key  23:56
superimposed upon his or her body. And accompanying set of tones contains color plates of each creature fully captioned in English and Latin, which can be consulted during the slideshow, or separately. This seems to me to be a wholly admirable enterprise, and it's no skin off my nose if it earns pebble head a fortune. Indeed, one might ask what comparable service to humanity, neurasthenia or otherwise, is being provided by other best selling paperback authors. Perhaps I'm being unfair to the likes of Andy McNab, Barbara Taylor Bradford and Martin Amos, but were aware of their initiatives to give succor and hope. Hope to jangle brained Aqua persons pig farmers posties stamp collectors bell ringers, detectives pie shop proprietors and Conquistadores. pebble head deserves a medal or at least a tin cup and I for one will happily campaign on his behalf, I shall be outside the town hall with a placard and a flask of tea at six o'clock tomorrow morning. And every morning, join me.

I'm gonna end this week's show with an extract from fangs in the midst. And what's gonna happen is that I'm just gonna be faded out. My voice will get quieter and quieter. And then it will be gone. fangs in the mist. Chapter one. By the way, things in the mist is an exciting detective drama. While Hugh was sliding on the lake, he fell and sprained his wrist. Sorry, I'm going to interrupt myself again. Because I realized that before being faded out, I need to very much thank Claire who played the part of the child of gumption. And she'd only actually seen the script of her part about three minutes before reading it. So thank you very much to Claire for doing that at such short notice. And I don't think there's going to be much of fangs in the mist but I'll read some more of it. My sister has a blue veil made of golf balls.
