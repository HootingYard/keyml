Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and here a couple of minutes late, but live as ever. It's hooting yard on the air. My attention was drawn to a letter in The Guardian a week or so ago. Here is the letter. Brian Simpson obituary second of February was indeed a gifted raconter. At a British legal history conference many years ago. his presentation on 19th century case law on liability for reservoir maintenance wasn't just learned and lucid. It was also one of the best stand up comedy routines I've ever seen or heard. Dr. Dre be post, castle town bear, County Cork, Ireland. The good doctor post does not give the precise date of the legal history conference to which he refers, which is a pity, as it leaves us unclear whether the light Brian Simpson was inspired by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson or vice versa. For 19th century case law on liability for reservoir maintenance was as any Dobson is knows, a pet subject even a Shandy and hobbyhorse of the pamphleteers his antipathy to public speaking meant that he would never have had an audience rollicking in the aisles, as Simpson did, and not even the most enthusiastic Dobbs inist would call his many pamphlets on the subject funny, or even mildly amusing. If anything, the dog sonian browers bit clouded by a mist of deathly seriousness whenever he addressed the issue of reservoir maintenance from any angle. He was fascinated not just by 19th century case law on liability, but by the minutiae of reservoir maintenance in other centuries, and in fields other than the legal such as general water management, engineering, geography, geology, history, archaeology, and the byways of fanatical and historical religion. It has been said that Dobson's interest in reservoir maintenance began after he toppled from a dam into an ill maintained reservoir, one st Mungo's day, in a year, no scholar has ever been able to pin down with any certainty. what he was doing atop the dam in the first place, is one of those ineffable mysteries that drives sensible persons to the brink of madness, if they cannot be persuaded to drop the matter. One is reminded of the tragic case of FX spray, who lost his wit, after 30 years of increasingly monomaniacal research, without ever having ascertained which damn Dobson toppled from in which country on what date in what year, and whether the boots he was wearing, at whatever time it was, had any role to play in his top moment. Adding to the tragedy of the spray case, is the possibility that the pamphleteers interest in reservoir maintenance was not occasioned by his own experience at all. New research in his benighted infancy, suggests that among the few periodicals to which his parents subscribed was annals of reservoir maintenance, bound copies of which were found in a dustbin about a mile from the pamphlet his childhood home, at least one volume, carrying on its reindeer hide cover, a thumbprint, almost certainly belonging to Dobson pair. But these are matters of conjecture. And conjecture is the enemy of blinkered certainty, as well we know. wearing our blinkers were able to assert the Dobson wrote no fewer than a dozen pamphlets on the subject of reservoir maintenance, each of them are last now out of print.

With equal certainty, we can say that the most important of these pamphlets the one which will be read 190 200 years hence, if of course, anybody sees fit to reprint it is the one in which Dobson posits a correlation between the types of ducks disporting themselves in a reservoir, and then number of criminals drowned in the same reservoir after being convicted of their crime or crimes bound hand and foot with hemp inserted into a burlap sack and flung into the reservoir by a pair of executioner's each paid in poultry for their services. Such were the ways of judicial mercilessness. At one time in certain districts, one might think that drowned wretches from the past and present day ducks had no connection whatsoever. Why might even continue to think this after reading Dobson's pamphlet, and, excuse me, for it must be said that for all its statistical tables and graphs and bold illustrations, ducks and criminals and well maintained reservoirs out of print is written in a sort of hysterically overwrought prose, possibly inspired by hypnogogic visions, which make the thrust of Dobson's argument extremely difficult to grasp. There is also the point of course, that the pamphleteer could hardly tell one type of duck from another, even when armed with an illustrated Field Guide suitable for nippers. His ignorance does not deter him, and he makes what one gathers if read several times to ring some sense out of them, a sweeping pronouncements about matching tallies of pickpockets and pot child forgers and mergansers murderers and to all the other 11 pamphlets on reservoir maintenance are somewhat easier to understand, written in plain prose, and were collected together in a sort of Uber pamphlet entitled 11 essays on reservoir maintenance by one who knows out of print. The cover featured a spectacular mezzotint by the noted mezzotint is Rex tint, showing a mezzotint just sitting on a camping store atop a spectacular dam executing a mezzotint of a spectacular reservoir in which pot shrouds mergansers, and teal, Bob about on the surface, while patches of shading and cross hatching hinted a number of soaking wet sacks many fathoms deep, containing the soaking wet corpses of pickpockets and forges and murderers bound with soaking wet hemp.

Tell me, if you will, for what conceivable reason, you would snap off the Horn of a goat crammed with exotic fruits and flowers and presented as a gift to the main goat. That is one version of the origin of the horn of plenty, or corn Neucopia. And it seems to me an example of where the Greek gods got things decidedly skew with presenting a goat with a gift, whether in recompense for its injury, or out of simple generosity is a perfectly legitimate act, though it would probably be content with leaves and metals. My concern here is not with the goat, but with the horn of plenty. Put yourself for a moment in the position of the recipient. You need not be an actual or mythical goat In this scenario, Zeus or some other donor hand you a cornucopia. Why, thank you. That is so kind you cheer up having been well brought up. You are most welcome says Zeus or the zeusie figure who can now vanish their part in this critical playlet fulfilled. You are left holding a receptacle stuffed with fruits and flowers. But any warm feelings of gratitude you may have are immediately overcast by the realization that saturates the shape of the container. You cannot put it down safely. Unlike a vase or a bowl or a jog wrought by human agency. The horn of a goat is not designed to be placed on a flat surface such as a coffee table or sideboard the sorts of places where you're likely to want to put a gift of fruits and flowers. It will simply topple over disgorging its contents, some of which such as apples and cows bad plums will roll off the coffee table or sideboard onto the floor where they are likely to be bruised, crushed underfoot, or worse Nord or swallowed whole by your domestic pet depending that is on the size and rapacity of said pet. Even those fruits and flowers which remain a top of the coffee table or sideboard will be scattered and possibly damaged by they're scattered. And in any event, the charming visual arrangement of the cornucopia will be ruined. So although you will be happy to have been given lovely fruits and flowers, and in such abundance, a moment's reflection will lead you to dark mutterings, that the form in which they have been given is both unsuitable and inconvenient. For unless you're going to spend the whole day cradling the goats horn in your arms, keeping it upright, thus frittering away the hours when you could be doing something useful. You're now forced to find some way of relinquishing the cornucopia while keeping it intact. You could try leaning it up against something, but there's no guarantee that in doing so it will retain stability. Alternatively, you may have a vase or bowl or jug of sufficient size that the horn of the goat can be placed within it snugly enough not to fall over. A third option is to remove the fruits and flowers one by one with care and to marshal them in attractive display at an appropriate place in your hovel. Of course. Once that's done, you're left holding an empty goat horn, which we might as well toss aside as worthless. Whichever of these strategies you employ, my point is that any gratitude you feel towards Zeus, or to whom at whomsoever gave you the cornucopia will not be unalloyed. There will be an admixture of irritation or resentment, even of active hostility for the hoops you have been put through. When the time comes to write a thank you letter as your exquisite manners demand, it may be hard to refrain from injecting a somewhat jaundiced tone, which is picked up by the cornucopia donor could lead to ill will between the pair of view even to the author sundering of the ties of friendship, which have bound you so close over so many years. And all because the fruits and flowers came in a container, not fit for purpose.

highlight of the hooting yard here is the annual jamhuri currently organized by the sawdust bridge community pole vaulting collective and the pointy town Avalon colliery marching band. Sebastian Coe may have described tickets for the 2012 Olympics as the greatest tickets on Earth. But clearly he has never seen a January ticket I think of unsurpassed beauty, not just on Earth, but on any other planet or planetoid or flaming ball of gas in the known or unknown universe. had he done so he would eat his hat with knobs on it may look like a mere slip of thin beige cardboard with a few letters and numbers printed upon it in bold black ink. But this year, as every year, the Jamboree ticket was designed by the noted ticket hist Rex tick, a man who knows more than Sebastian Coe could ever learn about the design of tickets had he bought world enough and time and he has not. For all those naked wrestling bouts with William Hague, in a basement gymnasium at the Palace of Westminster have taken their toll. And now he's reduced to offering hyperbolic twaddle when era broadcasters microphone is thrust towards his gob. The gods have noted tickets just wrecked. Tick, on the other hand is taciturn. He is a taciturn fellow. In fact, one weird dubbed tick the taciturn tickets list on precisely that account. And the fruit of his task Eternity is the unparalleled beauty of his ticket designs. Every year, he comes up with something of such blinding glory that some Fish seats have been known to buy a ticket without any intention of attending the annual jamhuri in that squelchy squelchy mud strewn field. No, the dandies put their ticket in a frame and hang it on the wall of their boardwalk or salon to impress their equally foppish pals with the exquisite delicacy of their sensibilities. So untold at any rate by Rex ticks sister, the vamp dot tick who's been seen stepping out with an art critical to but the tickets are not the only things of eye popping splendor on show at the Jamboree when they come vaulting interview from across sawdust bridge, the athletes of the community pole vaulting collective display on their jerkins insignia designed by the noted heraldic emblem missed Rex blehm consisting of three botnets rampant engrailed as you on a field goose with brass on genre LaShawn sewn into place over there pounding heart, the emblem has thrice one the top pole vaulting club insignia cap, awarded by the Academy of pole vaulting and bird spotting and shilly shally sold us for a punch wristband that was never enough to set the cup for he is a recluse. According to the graffiti signia just drinks his tea for flask and has his boiled egg balanced in a condition of rubber bands and balsa wood. It comes as something of a surprise to learn that the avid miners of the Avalon colliery marching band from pointy town have no insignia of their own, basically enough to the point and badge emblazoned on the backs of their helmets. What they lack in visual zip however, is more than made up for by their musical prowess with their true bows and xylophones. And on par Papa's. They marched across the bridge in the wake of the pole vaulters, playing a repertoire including Scriabin Arnold Bax transcriptions from field recordings of howler monkeys and Kenny the Explorer. The field in which the howler monkeys were recorded is of course a very different field from the squelchy squelchy mud strewn one in which the jam berry takes place when the community pole vaulting collective and the Avalon colliery marching band have crossed the bridge and successfully negotiated their way past the heavily armed centuries, drawn exclusively from the ranks of the most sociopathic cadets. The centuries have their own insignia,

and their own music buzzed directly into their ears by transmitters which pick up signals from the nether world. ticket holders have nothing to fear from the centuries, but won't be tied to the fool who tries to skulk past their concrete hats. ticketless What do you think is the reason for that line of heads impaled on spikes, stretching as far as the eye can see.

Just before I go on to the next piece, thanks to Roland for the community pole vaulting collective and ditching signia until Robin have on colliery marching band. And on the eighth of March 1941, Virginia Woolf wrote in her journal, I think it is true that one gains a certain hold on sausage and Haddock by writing them down. The neurasthenic novelist choice of words suggests that she was not quite sure about this. I think it is true rather than it is true, or more assuredly, Now, listen here lumpen pros because I won't say it again. One gains are certain hold on sausage and Haddock by writing them down. Is it pertinent that before the month of March was out, wolf did away with herself by plunging into the river ooze, her pockets crammed with stones while she led to her watery end, at least partly because she was not entirely sure in her mind that writing down sausage and Haddock genuinely helped her to grasp sausage and the Haddock. I decided to test the idea a month shy of the 17th anniversary by setting up a camping stall on the banks of the ooze. Armed with paper and pencil. As a precaution, I did not fill my pockets with stones. Indeed, I went further donning a life jacket and slipping a rubber rings stolen from a lie though about my waist. In a pocket of the life jacket, I stowed a whistle so that if need be, I could pop it loudly and repeatedly to summon help. gritting my teeth and jutting my jaw, I took my pencil and wrote the possibly fate for words on a sheet of paper. And I waited. I rested my hands, palms uppermost on my knees, hoping to grasp a sausage in one hand and a Haddock in the other. If they did not appear, would I feel compelled to plunge into the ooze? Well, listeners I sat it out for upwards of three hours before rain began to fall in England. There was sign neither of sausage nor have Hajduk but nor crucially had I had any compulsion to fling myself into the ooze, or therefore conclude that Virginia Woolf had other things on her poor battered mind on the day of her death, not sausage, not Haddock.

It's quite something to witness tongues of Pentecostal fire, wrapping and flickering around the head of a mano got quite something indeed, and then to hear the mano God babble in languages previously unknown to him, that is even more extraordinary. There has been about one disappointment thus far in the course of my experiments, and it is that not one of the languages inspired by the flames is identifiable as a genuine foreign tongue. When I decided to embark upon this important religio linguistic hoo ha, a year ago, my first step was to have constructed for me by decent, honest tradesmen, a chamber, the ceiling of which was so designed that serried ranks of Bunsen burners could be installed in it, pointing downwards. It was not enough, you see that the heads of my monoblocks be lapped by flames. Being Pentecostal fire, the flames must descend from on high upon the heads below. I next had to make adjustments to the burners themselves, much as I would like to, I cannot divulge the exact nature of my tweaking and tinkerings. Suffice to say that my assistance at this stage, we're not the decent, honest tradesmen, but figures plucked from various ranks in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, plus a couple of fire scientists. Well, I knew that ordinary flames could hardly be expected to prompt a mano God to speak in a foreign language. My burners must blast fourth crew Pentecostal fire. obtaining an old reel to reel tape recorder. To keep a permanent record of the languages uttered by my test subjects was a simple enough matter. There is a boy with a Barrow in the marketplace, from whom such items can be bought. I purchase too, just to be on the safe side and a mounting of reels of magnetic tape. The Beatle at Pang Hill orphanage was of immense help to me in procuring volunteers. He gave me his personal guarantee that each one of them was Amano, GLAAD and I never had reason to doubt his word, especially when I saw that grubby drooling halfwit, ergens he regularly delivered to me on his cart, drawn by horses as inelegant as his cargo. Indeed, it was a wonder to me that some among these tattered mammalian, hobble the boys had ever mastered their mother tongue. ushered into the chamber where the reel to reel tape recorders were already whirring away. Each volunteer was strapped into a chair, nothing if not rigorous, I had each of them after a few words to provide recorded evidence of their spoken language before the Pentecostal fire was unleashed upon them. Some had to be prompted to speak by being poked at with sticks. I have a debt of gratitude to my hunch back to system mango for expediting this part of the process. Mango and I then left the chamber, locking and bolting the door behind us and fastening it further with a length of heavy iron chain. I took my plate in an armchair well mango scrambled up onto the roof of the chamber in his spidery way and set the Bunsen burners roaring, spitting out Pentecostal fire upon the heads of my monoglot often volunteers. On the following day, the Beagle came rolling up in his cart to collect the newly minted polyglots taking some back to Pang Hill orphanage, some to a clinic discreetly hidden in the mountains, and some to the graveyard. with mango at my side, I transcribe the recorded utterances from the tapes while snacking on logon berries and fried dab. I have now filled thousands upon thousands of pages with polyglot speech inspired by Pentecostal fire, and every single word of it is incomprehensible babble and raving, but if I have not my faith, I have nothing. I know deep in my holy bones, that sooner or later one of my little orphan volunteers is going to pipe up in pure unalloyed Swedish or Tagalog or Vlaams for through the Pentecostal flames speaks the spirit. If thus far, it has not made clear its intentions for the people of the earth, prattling gibberish instead of sense,

then I must wait, wait within human patience and continue to funnel monoblocks into my chamber, and have mango set the burners in the ceiling, belching fire down below.

And that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. Hope you've enjoyed it and all else being equal. I'll be back with more such stuff next week. Bye bye.
