What's that song about his arm t? job. It sounded like he was saying all anti anti anti. I don't think I'm gonna mention my anti on this show, although I might. Um, my name is Frank key, and this is hooting out on the air. It's not about my auntie, but we're going to begin this week with children's storytime. So gather the tinies around the fire side. And, and then you can all listen to children's storytime. One Fallon thunderous day principal Geneseo was much pained to learn that there was running amok in his castle, a reprehensible top when it comes to this reprehensible top, he asked the henchmen who had brought him the news. Prince for Geneseo hated all tops infant and tinies with a hatred that burned his black soul. The henchman was ignorant of the provenance of the top, but he was rightly terrified of principal gente owes rages. So he made up a story about the top having been delivered to the castle in the talons of a fierce and gigantic bird of prey. There were many holes in this tale, and it would not have stood up to the nearest scrutiny. But in his petulance and rage, the prince did not listen to it carefully, and he accepted it without question. Find the top and throw it down the deepest well in my domain, ruled the prince and then find the bird of prey and trap it in a neck. The henchman wrote these commands down in his hench pad, so he would not forget them, then clanked away in his armor, to one of the many pantries where he joined other henchmen who were cruising and glugging great flagons of fermented goatee milk and henbane. Not long thereafter, all a henchman was sprawled on the floor of the pantry, in a stupor, away with the fairies. Meanwhile, up in his chamber principal Gen zeos rage was unabated. So terrific was his temper that he began to see hallucinations, not the least of which was the reprehensible tot itself, grown to an enormous size and banging a spoon against a bowl. I am at the end of my tether shriek the prince, I am become unhinged. It was rare for principal Geneseo to demonstrate such a level of self awareness. Though had he but paused to consider the matter. He would rapidly have apprehended that there were neither tethers nor hinges about his person. On the contrary, he was dressed in his finery, silks and satins and rich brocade, garish, brightest fire, brighter than the sun, which had not shown on his castle for years uncountable. I have no need of sunlight. The prince had said in his karma moments, for I pour forth my own princely effulgence so dazzling it blinds all those who have the temerity to look upon my countenance. This was, of course a delusion, but there was nobody in the castle who dared to tell principal Gen CEO what was what? Nobody that is safe for the reprehensible, Todd, who now came scampering into the princes chamber. It was much much smaller than the Phantom version, born of the princes visions, yet no less alarming. It was unkempt, and spotted with patches of milky sick and emitted a deafening keening. Why are you not at the bottom of a well cried principal Geneseo. But the reprehensible thought had not yet learned to form coherent words. gazing directly into the printers face. It screamed and wailed and then bounced up. Another garbage of sick.

The prince called for his henchmen. But they did not come, for they were still away with the fairies. And it was those very same fairies, of course, not a bird of prey, which had delivered the reprehensible top to the castle into the presence of the prince. From that day forth, the top would cling to the prince, like a witch's familiar keening into his ear and splattering him with sick until truly at the end of his tether and cruelly unhinged principal Jensen Geneseo gave up the ghost, unknown and anointed the top as his dough for his son on air. Were upon the top of a sudden broke into human speech and called for the henchmen and had Prince Fulgencio thrown down the deepest well in his domain. For years uncountable thereafter, peasants would often see circling over the well, a fearsome gigantic bird of prey, which, when paired up closely dissolved into a shower of fairies, fairies, stained with sick

we move now from stories for tiny children, to a paste for the aged and wrinkled and withered because this is this is the style Jaffa people who remember long ago in the past. One of the tragedies of our age of pap is that some of the greatest entertainers of the past have been largely forgotten, and consigned to oblivion. And none more so than the titans of our seaside past. Those who used to dazzle and delight, teeming thousands of holiday makers. The peers were once they crawled the boards are themselves now mostly in ruins, if not vanished utterly. Yet once the roaring of the sea was drowned out by the roaring and cheering and laughter of the crowds gathered to see entertainments, the like of which we shall surely never witness again. Now all we have left, a brittle yellowing newspaper cuttings, such as this one clip from the pointy town, bucket and spade, dated the 18th of November 1913. Your correspondent trudged to the end of the pointy pier in pointy town for an out of season variety show. In spite of the torrential rain and bitter winds and the pervading stench of bilge water and rotting fish. Dozens of Dowty holidaymakers packed out the Miss blossom Partridge Memorial variety theatre for an afternoon of Tip Top entertainment. Top of the bill with those stars of the pointy pear, Mr. peevish and his lovely wife Gwendolyn, they did not disappoint. Mr. peevish, was peevish, and his lovely wife colorway. Gwendolyn with the lovely the business with the dance sock, the table napkin, the funnel and the screeching pipistrelle bat brought the house down. I myself was in floods of tears. When lovely Gwendolyn sang the sentimental ballad. Oh, bring me your winding sheet Mother of mine, for the performance of which she was wrapped in her mother's actual winding sheet still bearing the bloodstains coughed up by that good woman in her extremity. That Mr. peevish remained thoroughly peevish during his lovely wife's rendition is proof indeed, of his consummate peevishness. The evening ended with a magic trick, or at least what I took to be a magic trick. Several members of the audience were of a differing view, and believed that Mr. peevish and his lovely wife Gwendolyn had indeed produced in material form emerging from a puff of smoke, the great beast itself, as described in the book of Revelation. Police Constable on duty was trampled underfoot as the audience fled in fear of their lives. Later that evening, I noticed that the streets in the immediate vicinity of pointy pier were covered in some kind of vile noise, some sludge, small fires were burning, and every sprig of vegetation was every sprig of vegetation was blackened and charred and dead, along with a goodly number of puppies and kittens, which would unwisely strayed from the comforts of hearth and home.

The term performance took place in Miss blossom partridges Memorial theatre, and Miss blossom Partridge had a weekly digest, which was one of the great magazines of the Victorian age. And I'm gonna read you an extract from it now. Last week in Miss blossom partridges weekly digest, we considered the sputum of giraffes. So this week following the extremely complicated scheme devised for this series, we turn inevitably to the spittle of donkeys. We looked at giraffe sputum in unnecessarily abstract theoretical manner, but when it comes to the spittle of donkeys, we're going to take a more practical approach. So roll up your sleeves, wash your hands with swarf eager and let's get down to business. The first thing you need to do is to find some donkeys do not for one minute think you can come a trespassing in my lovely bucolic donkey sanctuary however, it is surrounded by an electrified fence and every hundred yards or so there is a watchtower, in which is perched one of my entries, centuries, armed with a high velocity snipers rifle. Step over the whitewashed line parallel to the fence and you will be shocked in the center of your forehead. I do not Bandy about the word sanctuary loosely. Far better that you go to the seaside, where donkeys are often to be found giving rides along the beach to overexcited tinies the seaside donkey master may not take kindly to you collecting spittle from one of his donkeys. So what you will need to do is turn your one away from the pack. Pick a donkey that is not at the time, laden with a squealing infant on its back. A small bale of straw ought to be sufficient temptation for the donkey, but you will need to ensure the donkey masters attention is distracted. This could be accomplished by for example, setting fire to an ice cream kiosk elsewhere on the beach. While the donkey master is gazing, open mouth that the conflagration wave the small bale of straw in the face of your chosen donkey and you're it away until you are consumed by sand dunes or some similar seaside beach feature. Do not fret your little head about being charged with donkey abduction. Once you have collected it spittle, you're going to return the donkey when she found it no harm done. Before so returning it, you will again need to divert the donkey masters attention. For this purpose. It can be useful to have an accomplice a stooge who swims out to sea and then pretends to be drowning, frantically waving their arms and shouting but we are leaping ahead of ourselves. Julie hidden behind June's or similar you can begin to feed handfuls of straw to the donkey. As it manches spittle will be produced from various glands in its mouth. I will not go into the precise physiological details. Just bear with me. Now, while I'm with one hand you tear off portions of straw from the bale and stuffed them into the donkey's mouth, which your other hand, you should be holding a bowl under its chin to collect such spittle as it dribbles and drools. Remember that some donkeys slobber while eating more than others and do not hit any panic buttons. provided the donkey monkey straw for about 10 minutes. It should almost certainly produce sufficient spittle to fill your bowl if not to the brim, then as near as dammit. When you are happy with the amount of donkey spittle in your bowl, transfer it to a flask by means of a siphon and funnel. Pat the donkey on its head to show your appreciation. Then use your walkie talkie to alert your accomplice who should come scampering out of a chalet in his swimming costume and hair across the beach and plunge into the sea and swim out and then pretend to be drowning and wave and scream.

peering out from behind the dunes. Make sure the donkey master is distracted and lead the donkey back, inserting it among the other donkeys as if it had never been away. If an infant is loitering nearby, pick it up and plop it onto the donkeys back. Thus, when the donkey master turns around to scan his donkeys, he will be even less likely to think one of them has been viewed the white behind the sand dunes to have it spittle collected. You can now go home in your kitchenette, pour the donkey spittle out of the flask into a container. There will almost certainly be a few strands of manch straw intermingled with the spittle. So pick them out with a pair of tweezers and discard them in your bin. Do the same with any other foreign bodies that have found their way into the container until you have 100% pure donkey spittle. This can then be used for a vast range of different purposes, most of which hark back centuries and have come down to us through rustic law and wisdom. While you ponder to precisely what purpose you intend to put the speckle of the donkey. Take a moment to thank your lucky stars that you live in an enlightened age. Had you been found poring over a container of donkey spittle? virtually any time in those past centuries, he would have been burned as a wick.

I'd now like to read to you, Mr. Keys epistle to the Ephesians. Greetings effizienz. How are things in FSS better I hope than they are here at hemoglobin towers where we're having terrible troubles, including an infestation of pipistrelle bats, a plague of locusts a dog in a manger main john our turnips, an outbreak of scruffier gluten intolerance, incursions by barbarians, hot flushes, cold sores, ungainly hat angles, football hooliganism, honestly manifestations of the ghost of googie withers, and more general withers of our googy and our bougie and our jazz funk groove. We have all that to contend with effizienz while you lot a no doubt sprawled on your Uffizi, and demands in FSS gobbling grapes and swinging tumblers of in toxic and fluid and having a debauch time of it. Anyway, the reason I'm writing is that I hope to escape from the several horrors swirling about hemoglobin towers. And I've booked a shower bank to emphasise leaving from the bus station at sawdust bridge next Tuesday at noon, or nearish to noon. But I do not have anywhere to stay when eventually I arrive in FSS assuming I do arrive and do not perish from poisoning by the fumes of the shower bank, which is old and clackety. And there's not so far as I know, passed any of the rigorous Vehicle Safety tests One might hope it had. Still, I must keep my pecker up and stride bowling into the future without worrying my little head too much about expiring from noxious vapors. So if we assume I will turn up at the bus station in Ephesus at some point, is there anybody among you effizienz who could put me up in a chalet or a room or a tent, or even on a picnic blanket open to the elements? I'm afraid I'm panelists, and cannot pay us a CEU by way of rent. But I will happily entertain my host by singing lustily to the accompaniment of a Piccolo I have a repertoire of several pieces cover versions, mostly including my own interpretations for want of a better word of Vienna by Ultravox Dr. bowgun broom by Jethro towel, and the poem of ecstasy by Alexander Scriabin, whose hands Incidentally, were as tiny as my head is tiny proportionately speaking, if that means anything concrete, which upon examination, it probably does not. But then I'm having difficulty concentrating. As an addition to all of the other troubles listed above. There is now a swarm of wasps outside my window, desperately trying to find its way into my Illa pointed Boudreau. Ah. Oh, and one more thing effizienz the Shara bank driver has just informed me that he has absolutely no idea how to get to emphasis. So if one among you could provide simple directions, so simple that even a dimwit could understand them. That would be dandy. Grace, be with all love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.

pitched past pitch of grief. I wept buckets of tears. Then on my Bakelite wireless set, I heard Chrissy hind commanding me to stop my sobbing. I usually find Miss hind persuasive, and in spite of the fact that I felt more pangs. I did a she bid. The buckets were both about three quarters full. I hosted them one in each hand, and carried them off across the blasted Heath. I hoped to get a good price for my tears from the tear manga. What have you got for me today? he asked. When I came, toiling up to his kiosk. He was a fat slick duplicitous, argumentative, mocking, gloomy, patched up greasy dribbling, bug eyed, ragged vitamin deficient debauch Great Bear of a man, all frills and flaps, and I did not warm to him. But he was the only working tear manga in that part of the glade. I have two three quarter buckets of my own grief stricken tears, I said, lifting the buckets on tears counter, the odd them coldly. What you said to me, he smiled. You are neither an orphan nor a virgin if memory serves. Look, I said, imploring Him. These tears were wrong wildly from pangs of grief. They must be worth something. I might see my waiter giving you a soup, he said. A soup? I asked. What is that in pains, ceilings and pins. I knew very well that a soup was worth only a fraction of a pin. But I hoped hopelessly, to shame the tear monger into offering me a little more. He started faffing about with a sachet of gruesome murder victim widows tears, gruesome murder victims, widows tears. See this, he said, tears shed in the actual presence of the lump Bring walrus moustache psychopath babinski as he buried his axe in the head of the poor woman's husband. Now those are tears that fetch a pretty pin. But I was pitch past picture grief, I protested. He dipped his fingers into one of the buckets, then licked them with his unholy tongue, tasting my tears. not salty enough for true grief, he said. And in any case, the buckets are only three quarters full. In my experience, true grief gives vent to unstoppable tears. I think you were just moping under my breath. For the first and I hope last time in my life, I cursed Krissy Hind. I knew it would be pointless to appeal to the tear monger. I had him down as a jazz funk fan. There was little I could do, but except his soup, he gave me an egg cup full of minestrone. And I've turned away heading for that place in the past, we've been cast out of Oh,

go That was a terrible attempt to do a line from back on the train gang. But you know, I went for it. I attempted it. And I think that counts for something might not count for much, but it counts for something. That's the end of this week's show. Really. I haven't got time to start anything else. I think it might be worth mentioning, too, that I had a absolutely astounding revelation. Earlier this week. Regular listeners will know that I'm unreasonably obsessed with the assassination of john F. Kennedy, to the point of mania, and those of us who are so obsessed, have two particular phrases. We're very fond of the grassy knoll, of course, and the picket fence. And I was absolutely astonished to discover that the picket fence in Dealey Plaza, behind which one of the Phantom completely non existent, so called putative assassins who didn't exist. Anyway, the picket fence is not a picket fence at all. It's a stockade fence. It's like no, it's like being told that the grassy knoll was not grassy or now. Anyway, I had to go and lie down after I heard that and have a long nap. I think I might do that again. That's the end of this week's show. I'll be back with more informative twaddle next week and to the to the listener or reader who wrote me an email saying thank you for being the best thing on the internet. My thanks for that commendation. And is it true? You decide Bye bye.
