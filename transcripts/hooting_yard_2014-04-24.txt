Hello, this is hooting out on the air with me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. I wasn't here last week, I was, unfortunately somewhat debilitated. Actually, I'm still quite debilitated now, but I have struggled manfully into the studio to entertain you for half an hour. And, but two weeks ago, on the show I've read as far as I can remember, four chapters from Mr. Keys book of birds, which are my retitle Mr. Keys, bumper book of birds, a work in progress. And on today's show, you're gonna get some more chapters from that, plus some other stuff. But we'll begin with chapter five, the praten coal. The praten coal is a type of bird, beak, feathers, power of flight, etc, etc. It is something of a neglected bird. In a poll, when asked to list with a minimum of thought the first five birds that came into their heads, naught percent of respondents named the pratincole and there were a lot of respondents a lot. It was one of the biggest polls ever conducted by the prac in colo philia society, and the results caused these members, severe disappointment. pratten colo philia is the technical term given to the psychological state of attraction to pratten coals. This can vary from a casual regard and appreciation of the bird as when a person clomping about in the sort of environment where one might see a Pratt in coal meadows and marshes in southern Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. spots Weiland Swan smiles and says, gosh, what a delightful little pratincole two full blown crazed Adoration of the bird. Pratt in colos to files at the far end of the spectrum have been known to erect shrines and offers on which they place simulacra of the object of their obsession made from Plaster of Paris or plasticine, or wax or marzipan. Occasionally, they might obtain a stuffed pratincole from a friendly taxidermist. These people that do Lally but harmless, I knew might be acquainted with one for years without suspecting the nature of their in a mania, or even that they're mainly acts at all. Commonly, the first hint you will be given is when the Pratt in colo file speaking in a strangely heightened an excited tone of voice invites you into the sanctum where in stands the shrine or altar to their bird. In these circumstances, the best thing to do, having prostrated yourself upon the floor and jabbered around litany of nonsense as bitten, is to pretend you have an urgent appointment, preferably on the other side of town, and to Scarpa without looking back. Next time you bump into your acquaintance, you would be advised to steer the conversation away from any bird related topics whatsoever. It is a curious fact, however, that high spectrum praten colo files often display absolutely no interest in any other types of birds. If anything, they say blathering ignorant about birds in general. boffins have yet to identify the danger points which propel the casual or low spectrum praten colo file, the one clumping a bat with a pair of binoculars, and a healthy interest in other types of birds. To the bunkers level. It might have something to do with brain chemistry, or exposure to airborne toxins or trauma. Though it's difficult to imagine what possible trauma could be occasioned by our little pratincole. Still, the Lord moves in mysterious ways as we know, and it would not be beyond his wit to think up some horror involving a maddened flock of praten coals and visited upon a poor benighted soldier. I'm often asked, Well, no, I'm not often asked.

Frank Key  05:07
In fact, now I can think about it. Nobody has ever asked me. Mr. Key, if there is such a condition as praten colo philia Is there a concomitant condition of pratten colo phobia? Should like question ever be put to me, and I hope it will be one day before I die. I will have an answer ready.

Chapter Six of Mr. Keys bumper book of birds a work in progress. The Rock the rock is a type of bird. Actually, it's a fabulous bird, meaning it does not actually exist. Snow it's so it's not entirely true to say it's a type of bird. We might say instead that the rock is a type of bird imagined in the heads of persons or long ago, or possibly just one person whose Phantasm was adopted by others. Yay down the generations on to our own days. Fabulous is the root of the slang word fab, popular in the 1960s and surely overdue for a revival. The pop group, The Beatles were commonly known as the Fab Four. But that's not to suggest that like the rock, they did not actually exist. Or is it? Could the lovable mop tops be nothing more than a hallucination shared by millions? Could the Beatles be a stupendously complex work concocted by the avant garde Japanese conceptual artist Yoko Ono born 1933. I'm not going to argue the case or provide evidence for any theory, in part because it is to use Ambrose bierce his favorite word Bosh, but it's something well worth thinking about. Next time you find yourself at a loose end, as for example, when a few days go by without any new postage is at the hooting yard website. I know only too well that in those lamentable circumstances, my readers and listeners are reduced to quivering jellies, sobbing their hearts out and biting great chunks out of their hearth rugs. If they have hearth rugs to bite chunks out of, or indeed half for a hearth is present only where there is a fireplace. And with the advent of central heating, many homes are designed and built now without fireplaces, as George Harrison 1943 to 2001. once asked, isn't it a pity? George Harrison was a member of The Beatles, either real or imagined by Yoko Ono. But he asked his question in a song composed and recorded after the group's demise. Whether he ever existed or not. What we can say with certainty about Harrison is that he was fab. He was as fab as a rock. Which brings us back to the subject of our inquiry, the fabulous bird, what can be said usefully about a non existent bird? Not much really. I mean, what on earth is the point of babbling on about something that does not exist, and never has existed except as an idea inside people's heads. One cannot even say of the rock, as one can say of sun many other types of birds. Oh, so many, that it has a beacon feathers. its beak and its feathers are as imaginary as the rocket itself. It's merely a spectral thing. Upon close examination, it disappears from view, like the Snark it softly and suddenly vanishes away. There is possibly a scholarly essay to be written on whether the rock like the Snark was In fact, a boojum all along, we might ask the same question about George Harrison and the other three Beatles, having allowed that they were in Gruber to Billy fab, but possibly fabulous. We might consider whether any or all of them would Buddhism's. Some have identified their manager Brian Epstein 1934 to 1967 as the boojum indeed, as the boojum of Belgium's.

Again, I'm not going to give Capra inverse for the simple reason that my reference sources as fabulous as the rock. I just made up that at start that I just made up that Epstein boojum comparison, because I could, but now I've made it and read it out on the radio and posted it on his internet. It has become an idea, a concept, not unlike an Ono concept. Anybody typing Epstein boojum comparison into a search engine will find it and read it. And that's it may spread like wildfire through the heads of millions, just as Yoko Ono's Beatles did, just as over longer centuries, the rock did, or the idea of the rock, that fabulous bird, which never really existed at all.

Might have another bird later in the show. But something else now I've just read a book called The Wilder shores of marks by Anthony Daniels was published in 1991. And it's subtitled journeys in a vanishing world. Daniel, who's better known by the pseudonym, he's laterally adopted, Theodore Dalrymple, sensing in 1989, that communism was on the verge of collapse, and, quote, long fascinated by the passing of ways of life, unquote, traveled to five countries whose leaders refuse to read the writing on the wall. Those were Albania, North Korea, Romania, Vietnam, and Cuba. The rescue regime in Romania fell about a week after he left the country. Daniel says it's a splendid book, as one would expect from a man who keeps alive that curious tradition of medical doctors who are also accomplished writers. I'm thinking of say, Sir Thomas Brown, or Anton Chekhov. And one thing I was particularly pleased to learn in the book was that the Albanian town of fear had a twice weekly newspaper, entitled, the sweat of the peasant. It's not a great name for a newspaper. I mean, I'd buy it. Even if it were a daily, I'd read the sweat of the peasant. And anyway, of necessity, Daniels had to travel as part of an organized group. And he's very good on the type of wide eyed Western lefties who were the majority on such trips. Here's a quote. I cast my eye over my companions of the next 12 days, I had hoped for a rich crop of eccentrics among them, such as I had encountered at the annual general meeting of the Anglo Albanian society in London. Amongst previously the secretary of the society was a retired optician from Ilford, who discovered the Balkan paradise late in life and learn this language. The rank and file of the society seemed either elderly revolutionaries of the upper classes, who knew the key to World History yet somehow never learned how to do up their shirt buttons properly, or lonely, embittered, proletarian autodidact who dreamed of vengeance upon the world and called it love of humanity. While in Albania Daniel's visited the envy hodja Museum in the boulevard of Martha's in Tirana, there is or was a display of the condolences received from all over the world following his death. And one of them is from our old pal hardy old Baines, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party brackets Marxist Leninist closed brackets of Canada and the man you may remember who wrote song lyrics for Cornelius Cardew. Here is hardy or Baines is the beginning of hardy urbaines his official condolence to the Albanian people. The path which has been proven to be invincible by the life and work of comrade and vodka, who led his party and people in their most militant and uncompromising struggle against imperialism, social imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and all reaction and revisionism and opportunism of all hues in their service, and who has left an indelible mark on history. devotees of Cornelius Qadri will note that Baines used some of the exact same wording in his lyrics to the song, various only one lie, there is only one truth. It says something he says a lot I think for the genius of Karlsruhe, who may or may not have been able to do up his shirt buttons properly, being an upper class revolutionary. But it says something very much. A setting of such twaddle is both moving and beautiful.

Frank Key  22:12
Isn't that wonderful I mean it's beautiful and it's that combination of such wonderful music and absolute twaddle being peddled with lyrics. So it makes it i don't know i there's something great about that. One thing that perhaps is worth me pointing out at this point is that hardy or Baines and Cornelius Cardew, they're their little group, our school or their party believed that there was only one genuine ideologically pure Marxist Leninist regime on Earth, which you may have gathered from the lyrics, the tooling, Mount siteowner imperialist, reactionary, the only country that was okay with our vinea under envir hajah. But Curiously, neither cardroom nor Baines ever went to live there. Anyway, that's quite enough of that. I hope you enjoyed that piece of music, which I think is absolutely superb. And I mentioned in terms of doctors who are also writers, I mentioned briefly, so Thomas Brown, and I've been reading but then another thing I've been reading is about is sort of not a biography, more a sort of book a better book about Sir Thomas brown by Edmund Goss. And what. So Thomas Brown's second book, published in 1646, was pseudo doxy epidemic, which is more popularly known as vulgar errors. It's one of the compilations that was popular in the 17th century of the dawn of the dawn of the scientific age, really, and brown comes just before the enlightenment. All the things that people believe that are wrong, and he tell me shows them why they're wrong. And one of the valga errors he addressed in a pseudo doxie epidemic, was the belief widely held that the legs of the Badger are longer on the right side than on the left. This was generally accepted as the truth and was stated in many early books of natural history with considerable authority. So really, book brown demolishes this and says this is complete rubbish. Of course, badges don't have legs, longer on the right side than on the left. And in order to prove His point he, he criticizes Albertus Magnus who had said this. He notes that owl dro Vandy ad had disproven the Badr leg theory. And he also notes that Aristotle had said that an auger leg was repugnant to the course of nature. And Thomas brown goes on for quite some length to show that this is nonsense, and compares the cases of spiders, frogs and lobsters. All in his argument that badgers legs are of equal length. Now, it's this point that Edmund Goss, I was a great admirer of brown, but he provoked Edmund Goss to a rare fit of exasperate. So in his 1905 monograph on Sir Thomas Brown, Edmund gosse wrote as follows. Meanwhile, we cannot help asking ourselves why the learned skeptic did not immediately get hold of a real badger and measure his legs. He says that, upon indifferent inquiry, I cannot discover this difference in the length of them. But why did he not make sure for himself? It's true that badges are extremely shy and mysterious in their movements. And that no doubt it was not every sportsman in the neighborhood of Norwich who could boast of having dug one out of it Earth. It is perhaps to ask too much for us to wish that, in the zeal of his zoology, Thomas brown himself, with a sack

and a pair of badger tongs, and accompanied by some trusty yokels, and a cross bred Bull Terrier used to the business should have worried the bowels of Earth in some cups on a starlit night, and have procured a badger for himself. But surely, an observer so curious might have bargained with some farmer who lived out Catan way or close to a snag rabbit Warren under erland. For a specimen of so common animal, he comes to the correct conclusion that the monstrosity is ill contrived the shortness being affixed under the legs of one side, which might have been more tolerably placed upon the thwart or diagonal Movers. Quite so. But how briefly, the question might have been settled once for all with a tape measure, and the dead body of a badger.

Frank Key  28:22
So that's the end of the hooting of voting. It's not got a definite article. That's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. If anyone knows Incidentally, where I can acquire a pair of badger tongs as recommended by Edmund Goss, I'd be quite interested in getting hold of a pair. I've never heard of such a such a an instrument before. But yes, that's it for this week. I'll be back next week. And next week we'll have the next bird because I didn't have time to do the chapter seven, which was the new chapter eight chapter eight, which was, was it seven rights chapter seven, the next next bird in the book, but I'll save that for you for next week. Don't get too impatient. Bye bye.
