Good evening, this is indeed resonance 104 point four f resonance 104 point four FM. And this is hooting yard on the air. And my name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for a while. And I was perusing the shelves of my local branch of periodicals and other ephemera are us the other day, and I noticed the noted the existence of a glossy magazine called black hair. On the cover was a photograph of a woman with black hair. leafing through it I saw it was stuffed full of other similar photographs. And although I didn't read any of the articles, all of them seem to focus exclusively on the particular narrow topic of women with black hair. Being a man with almost entirely gray hair, I replaced the magazine on the shelf. plainly I was not the kind of reader it was aimed at. But then neither were some of the adjacent titles, which included black shirts, a magazine for the fascist community, black Narcissus for sexually frustrated nuns and black pudding, which seemed to be devoted wholly to celebrating the coagulated and subsidised blood of pigs. I looked in vain for the publication I was seeking tiny Indians favorite comic booboos hubo nuba turned on my heel and headed up the hill towards a clump of Aspen's where I sat down and lift a cigarette and look to Aspen's in a clump.

One windy morning in the late 1950s. Dobson became fixated with the desire to have a type of Plum named after him. Imagine the thrill he said to marigold true over breakfast, going to the fruit tourism asking for a half pound bag of Dobson's marigold Chu said nothing in reply, nearly casting her eye over Dobson in precisely the way a compositor might look at a pamphleteer. Thompson had a very flimsy grasp of matters botanical and had never grown any fruit in his life. He was ready to acknowledge that these were distinct disadvantages. If the world was ever to be enhanced by a poem called Dobson, drastic activity was required. After breakfast, putting on a pair of second hand Winkle pickers, he pranced off to the kiosk by the pylon on the patch of waste ground by the sewage plant, over which loomed the immensity of pill garlic tour, and above it a sky blue and clear and without any sign of an imminent hailstorm. accountably the kiosk was shot and not simply shot but boarded up covered over with a large rectangular panels of reinforced hardboard hammered into place with dozens of big fat nails. No signage had been pasted onto any of the panels to explain this startling state of affairs whenever anything changed within his familiar baileywick however, slightly Dobson was avid to be told about it, greedy for details, and ever on the lookout for signs and announcements and bulletins. In the absence of which he was liable to have a neurasthenic attack and emit little cries, just like Edgar Allan Poe when he got the jitters, or the wild boy of Avalon when deprived of potatoes. On this day, however, so consumed was the out of print pamphleteer with his plumb plan that he sailed on past the boarded up kiosk fleet in his Winkle pickers and carried on a longer line of bussing the sewage plant, and x passed the clown Hospital in the vinegar distillery and the bottomless Vita pit until crossing sawdust bridge. He approached a tobacconist here, thought Dobson, he might find the publication he was seeking for in addition to a range of pungent cigarettes and cigarillos and pipe tobaccos from the more benighted regions of the earth. The shop stocked a few magazines and penny dreadfuls and hastily pasted together prog rock fanzines alongside the complete works of john Ruskin and pirated editions, it was quite a tobacconists. As he pranced closer to its gaudy doorway however, the pamphleteers path was blocked by a peasant, leading an improbably numerous herd of goats to pasture. Dobson had no option but to stand and wait while goat after goat after goat after goat after goat passed slowly by just as our pamphleteer knew little of botany, it may be that the listener is ignorant of the goat world. Briefly then gota, cloven, hooved and satanic and their milk has a peculiar goatee flavor, and they come in a number of varieties, including the Nubian and the toggenburg, and the Anatolian black and the booted, and the fainting and the finish landrace. Some such goats were among the flock that passed in front of Dobson, who sat down on a tablet and ate some curds and whey cartons of which he kept in his pockets as emergency snack solutions. By the time the last of the goats clacked passed, and the weight of the tobacconists was cleared, it was lunchtime, and the shops shutters had been pulled down, and the tobacconist himself was fast asleep in a sort of man caught behind his counter. Undaunted, for there were still fires in his head regarding the plum project. Dobson pressed on, beyond the swimming pool and across Yoko Ono Boulevard, skirting the miasma of Grubbiness past two Brooks, one babbling and the other and babbling past a bear colony and a bee sanctuary, past a second shot tobacconist until he reached old mar purgatives newsagent and hazardous chemical waste compound. To his relief,

he found it neither boarded up nor closed for lunch, and skipping past a life sized cardboard cutout of Jethro towels Ian Anderson, playing his flute while standing on one leg which Omar purgative kept in the porch. Dobson entered. How now mistress P. cried Dobson in an unnervingly cheery tone. Are you a mystery shopper snapped back the ancient proprietress both her face and her voice curdled with spite. She was a proper caution, and had long ago lost whatever marbles her God had given her. Her God being a household one hung on a nail at the back of the shop wooden with savage talons in the shape of a crow with vermillion plasticine blobs for eyes. It held her in Thrall so he was a fairly regular customer. Dobson was used to old mob purgatives forgetfulness, and he did not take umbrage at being unrecognized. no mystery shopper I, he shouted in the foolish syntax he tended to deploy when speaking to shopkeepers. I am but an humble White, who seeks a copy of the current issue of so you want to buy or rent an orchard, the weekly magazine packed with much advertising of a fruity orchard nature. Omar purgative gulped. Dobson waved a wand in the air said something in rhyming couplets about frogs and toads and pies and sparrows, and sad little hop and skip. Her burning desire was to become a character in a fairy tale or nursery rhyme and to frighten children. But the pamphleteer was a grown man, and he had seen these shenanigans before, so he ignored old mar purgative and stepped over to the magazine rack. Various titles were shoved none too tightly into the battered wire slots of the stand. Mostly publications in foreign languages, or those invented by teenage science fiction enthusiasts, such as Zig bog as spoken by the super ignorant Zig Bulger Ah, in the long running radio serial pie shop Deep Space Nine. By the time Dobson had finished, rummaging fruitlessly through the tap, His hands were filthy, so he bought a jumbo tube of disinfectant goo before bidding almar purgative fair well, outside the sky was black, and the air was thick with pinging hailstones. Dobson scampered to a cow buyer for shelter. It was empty of cows for this was a Thursday, the day when cows in these parts were taken on excursions. Six hours later, when the hailstorm ceased, Dobson trudged home taking a different route along the canal to path pass the duck pond and the dirigible hanger and the museum or whisks past Pang Hill orphanage and the disgusting pit past large imponderables and smaller enigmas. And finally up the lovely lane lined with hailed drenched foxgloves and toadflax. marigold true without supervising some cows on a cow excursion. Dobson did not even pause to remove his Winkle pickers, but sat straight down at his escrow trois and wrote a one sitting the untitled and unpublished piece, which scholars have dubbed notes pursuant to the unraveling of the pamphleteers plumb plan. One windy morning in the late 1950s, he wrote, I became fixated with the desire to have a type of Plum named after me, knowing nothing of plums and not much about fruit in general, I hit upon the idea that by buying or renting my own orchard, I would have the leisure to experiment. In my mind's eye, I saw myself leaping out of bed every morning and come rain or shine sprinting off to my orchard there to propagate plum trees to study them with such rigor. That before long I would know all there was to know about plums, both them in UTI, and the big picture. I would have a shared in my orchard, which would become the world's finest plum library. I would spend entire afternoons peering at seeds, at first in ignorance, but gradually with ever greater perspicacity, I would dig and mulch and prune and cut, I would erect bird scarifiers and familiarize myself with the workings of a shotgun. And then one day years hence,

when so close was the resemblance been between a plum and my brain that it would baffle the most expert of fruit men, I would grow an entirely new type of plum, and I would call it the Dobson and thus My name would be immortal. Such was my dream. The very first step to realizing it was to obtain a copy of the current issue of that most excellent magazine. So you want to buy or rent an orchard. I strode out of doors with the vigor of a man 60 years younger. plumbin does and as I walked, I hummed the four last songs by Richard Strauss, one after another in the wrong but to me preferred order. The sky was blue and clear, with no hint of hail. Alas, my efforts to find a copy of the magazine came to naught. Then came the hail such teeming hail as I have never seen. I sheltered for hours in a deserted cow buyer, and with every ping of a hail stone upon its corrugated iron roof, the more dejected I became crushed by misery, I was almost tempted to the stupidity of pleading with old mob purgatives wouldn't household CRO God, was I such a weed that I would fall at the first hurdle? What I abandoned my plan plan simply because unbeknownst to me, so you want to buy or rent an orchard had ceased publication seven years ago, around the time of and because of the Korean War. It pains me to say that the answer to both these questions is yes, I sit here in my squelching, secondhand Winkle pickers gripping my pencil like a dying man's straw, and I peer into the future. And I know the shattering truth, that there never ever will be a plum called Dobson. human weakness, the puddle of a million dreams.

Notes pursuant to the unraveling of the pamphleteers plumb plan, we still have Dobson believed he could learn about seeds by peering at them. Other than suggesting entire afternoons as the length of time for a seed peering session, much that we would wish to know remains unsaid. I suppose we can assume that Dobson plan to parrot the seeds of a plum tree, but if he is right, that prolonged piering is in itself educational, one could presumably parrot any seed or seeds. The pamphleteer refers to seeds in the plural, but does not specify how many and one is left uncertain whether For example, He envisages peering at a single different seed on different afternoons or at the same URL Have unnumbered seeds each time, nor are we told whether he would use a powerful microscope. It would also have been helpful if Dobson could have given some clue as to the type of surface on which is observed seed or seed would be deployed. I mentioned all these points because it seemed to me dubious in the extreme that one would learn very much about seeds, or about anything else for that matter, simply by peering at them. And yet, who was I to doubt Dobson and arguably the most important pamphleteer of the 20th century, albeit an out of print one, I resolved to put this piering business to the test. Given the lack of detail in Dobson's account, I had to improvise somewhat. I decided to buy a packet of birdseed, partly in homage to the famous Phantom Dobson pamphlet, and partly because at the end of my experiment, I would have something to scatter on the serried bird tables of pointy town, about which more later I removed a single seed from the packet and placed it carefully on a piece of beige cloth laid flat on the tabletop. I chose beige as it's the most neutral of colors. Then I pulled up a chair and sat down and plunked my elbows on the table and rested my chin in my hands, not having a microscope, powerful or otherwise, I had to rely on my myopic eyes, peering at the seeds through my spectacles. It was morning rather than afternoon, but that meant I had a longer period of daylight to do my peering. I peered at the seed for nine hours. The following day, I placed a handful of seeds onto the beige cloth and peered at them for five hours. The next day, I took another single seed from the packet ladies on a sheet of expensive creamy note paper and peered at it for 11 hours. I continued seed pairing every day for two weeks, neglecting all other concerns and varying the number of seeds and the surface upon which they rested. One day I removed my spectacles to get a blurry perspective. When I wasn't hearing it seeds, I made notes, not on the expensive creamy note paper, which I save for letters to dowagers on contesters. But in a notebook I bought specially on the cover of which I pasted a label reading seeds studies. So was Dobson right? By the weird and eerie gods that stalk the land of God. Of course he was. When all my peering was done, and I went out scattering the bird seed on this cherry bird tables are pointing down. My brain was fat with seed law. I have a hard task ahead of me, but I aim to marshal well notes in my seed studies notebook into a coherent text to be to be issued later this year, or perhaps next, as the hooting yd Uber tome of seeds. I suspect it will make every other book about seeds ever published, fit only for the dustbin. And all thanks to Dobson to whom Of course, the Uber tone will be dedicated.

Yet more Dobson now this is a brief quotation. From Dobson an out of print Dobson pamphlet entitled, quite a few things I know about swans. There is a superstitious belief that swans cannot hatch their eggs unless a storm is raging the sky mad with lightning bolts and thunderclaps. I suspect this is true. For on the countless occasions I have gone blundering into swans nest I have never seen eggs hatching, and the weather has invariably been balmy for that is the kind of weather I prefer. When blundering about among the nests of swans. We have only Dobson's words that he blundered into countless swans nest during balmy weather conditions, and a number of commentators have cast doubt on this account. The out of print pamphleteer was probably lying through his teeth. Just to make a point, though, quite what the point is, is one of those ineffable dobsonian mysteries that Mike have which will keep students busy for the next thousand years. One man who certainly did pay visits to Swan habitats in both balmy weather and thunderstorms was our thang Vanda who can drop the artist and mountaineer who perished in the Hindenburg disaster. Although his own theological studies were decisively amateurish, even floored, they were sincere, and he approached them with great gusto. Our Fang first became interested in swarms when he was asked to draw one by a manufacturer of matches. Incredibly, he had no idea what a swan was, and had to be shown engravings and a large and exhaustive encyclopedia, then had to be patiently explained to him. But the swan was a type of bird fond of watery places. Our Fang was on his way to the seaside, ready to rent a sailing vessel and apply the oceans when he received an urgent message on his portable metal Tapping Machine, enlightening him as to the difference between the salt sea and the oceans on the one hand, and ponds, lakes and rivers on the other. He kept a copy of this communique in his pocket until the end of his life, not out of any sentimentality, but simply as an aide memoire, whenever he came upon a body of water. Our Fang could of course have copied a swan from the illustrations in the encyclopedia and earned his matchmakers money, but he prided himself on always drawing from life. Sometimes this could prove a considerable challenge, as when he was commissioned to provide a set of plates for an edition of HP Lovecraft at the mountains of madness. He never spoke of the circumstances in which he drew so vividly that knighted penguin fringed abyss, for example, and indeed, when questioned, are Fang trembled with an authentically lovecraftian shudder. Once he was on the right track in terms of watery habitat, however, the depiction of swans was a much easier task. Our fangs so his first swarm on some cloth on day 1924. He had been told by whom it is not clear that there was a pond within hiking distance of his temporary quarters, a shack on a patch of waste ground, somewhere in the foothills of a fantastic mountain. Taking a flask of air Ray aerated let us water, some ready toasted smokers Pop Tarts, and map a pad and a pencil are Fang headed off towards the pond, whistling an air by hurlstone. When he got there, he sat on a municipal bench, spotted a swan executed a quick sketch, ate and drank and hurried home before becoming drenched by teeming rainfall. He worked up the sketch into a finished drawing with his customer Erlang popped it in the post to match to the match manufacturer's agent and sat back to await his payment. Yet he found himself unable to relax, and then the following weeks was drawn back to the pond again and again. Whatever the weather to gape at swans, hardly bothering to sketch them. It was a stormy season, as it so often is, after some cloth odd day, according to folk wisdom, and our Fang had much opportunity to observe swans beset by thunder and lightning.

He left no record of seeing eggs hatched during a storm. And it has to be said there was a profound and enduring ignorance in his gaping, our Fang did not actually understand what he was looking at. Perhaps it was this pop eyed, empty headed stupidity that made him the artist he was one whose Swan pictures now fetch preposterous sums. One night by the pond, a storms blasted the sky and a girl How old are Fang was accosted by a mysterious figure who Hove towards him from out of the darkness. wasting his lantern to see plainly who or what it was. Our Fang had only a moment to look before the light spotted out. The figure wore a cloak, but her face was momentarily visible, and she bore a striking resemblance to and may even have been the ghost of captivity white, the childhood sweetheart of Eugene field, author of among other works, the children's favorite, winking, blinking a nod. When she spoke, it was with a voice both sepulchral and sweet. She told our Fang vendor who couldn't do it They were in the world, other ponds and other swans, and they were lakes and mirrors and rivers and streams were yet other swans might be found, and that he should go to them one by one and gape and sketch and work up his sketches and even paint in great splotches of emotion upon sheets of hardboard. The swans he saw all around the world, in watery places. And then captivity Wait, if indeed it was she made a delicate gesture of farewell, and walked away into the howling blackness of the night. And so next morning began the five tremendous years of our Fang Vanda, who conduct so called Wild Swan tour. Without the guidance of captivity white or her Phantom, however, there were false starts. Fang spent three months wandering in Arabia desert without seeing a single swarm, and a further week in the jungles of Borneo. He returned, battered and sick in spirit to his original pond, thinking he'd been in some ways deceived the sight of the swans, he knew in balmy weather and in storms, coddled him and he revived. He realized that if captivity, white had spoken the truth, and there were indeed swans elsewhere in the world, he would have to find a more reliable way of tracing them. He hit upon the method of hanging around in the sorts of taverns, frequented by waterbird enthusiasts, listening in on conversations, picking up clues, gradually learning the whereabouts of hundreds, even thousands of locations where the chances of finding swarms were high. Sometimes, of course, his information was flawed, or he missed her the significant detail in the roundedness of whatever Tavern he was loitering in, and he will take a long and uncomfortable train journey to a particular pond, only to discover it brackish and stagnant and home to nothing but weird, almost lovecraftian owl guy. But more often than not our fangs, unwitting informant sent him in the right direction. And that is why he's thought that he saw more swans in his five year tour than anyone had ever seen before. He did not sketch them all. But those he did. He worked up as captivity white had suggested it's a huge paintings Swan off the swan off the swarm, some in Twilight summon a blazing sun summon ponds, someone likes some on mirrors, and some gliding with Swan Lee grace down rivers and streams and even canals are Fang painted swans in balmy weather and in foul weather, and many a time in thunderstorms brooding over a clutch of eggs. Many of the pictures look to the untrained eye, almost identical, for our Fang was never the most skillful of draftsman, and his skills lay in sloshing great dogs of emotion onto his hardboard with haphazard zest, relying on a stencil to capture the basic swamp shape he sought. Curiously, the stencil was cut for him by a man named do it. And that's the end of this week, hooting out on the air. And I didn't have time to tell you that captivity white childhood sweetheart
