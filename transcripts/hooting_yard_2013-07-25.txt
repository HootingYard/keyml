Good evening This is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. And this is indeed the last show before the summer break. And I don't know if I'll be back my bear will maybe I won't. But other more immediate matter is, you're probably not going to know what on earth to do with yourselves at six o'clock on Thursday evening. Throughout August because there won't be any hunting yard. Luckily, there is something else you can do. Summer is here. And with it comes the annual pointy town nincompoops bizarre this year, as ever, the nincompoops bizarre will be held in a particularly pointed part of pointy town. Preparations are well in hand, and several nincompoops have already laid out their stalls this year. Among the bargains available for punters will be antimony, bread crumbs, curd, digestive biscuits, egg, tapestries, frozen milk, galoshes hat, ink, joggers, funnels, kaylynn, lemon meringue pie, mother's wreckage, North x rubbings, obsidian, cat helmet, preening equipment quicklime rusty pins, sausages, talc, urban pointy things, Volga snoods, wax, xylophones, yeast bags, and zookeepers cushions. In the Kathy Kirby Memorial tent were promised cats out collateral puppets, wind chimes, ear muffs, rat catchers trousers, tin yogurt, uncooked pork instant mashed potato awful portable advils anchors sock hoist damp cloth fears wild beast Glu Hornets DRAM Kevlar dog helmet limestone, zookeepers pincushions x rayed innards, custard viken sport scorecard bait noodles and mozzie pan there will be a flag atop of the tent and a Tannoy belting out nincompoop eyes versions of the instrumental bits from Cathy Kirby's chart toppers played on the glockenspiel. A map of the site should soon be available done in crayon and pencil by orphans from Pang Hill orphanage. The light is dim in the orphanage cellar, and the orphans are somewhat cack handed, so the map may not actually be very helpful. As an alternative, visitors can be guided around the bizarre by a goat on the end of a train, there is only one goat, so expect lengthy queues. The goat is an authentic nincompoops. toggenburg with three natural legs and one made of wood. The wooden leg has been given a slap of bright yellow paint to aid visibility in the more tenebrous areas of this pointy part of pointy town where the enormous pointy bits block out the sunlight with pointy black shadows. In the lay of the shadows are several specialists towards offering mobilenet nasal sprays blood oranges, vapor composite patterns soap zisis for bone scraping, zookeepers, pin cushion holders, lettuce, kedgeree jumping fleas, helicopter pilots insignia, grease froth, desk tidy string, asbestos, potato novelties, or pigment Ising glass, unhelpful maps yachting caps trick propelling pencils roto gravures, embossed badger badges will over wisps and quince jelly.

Following certain unspeakable tragedies that occurred at last year's nincompoops bizarre. The organizers are at pains to point out that no nincompoops will be armed to the teeth this time around. Of course, they shouldn't have been allowed to bring all those pointy sticks and poison tip pointy glances and pointy souls. signpost chaos metline mistook the nincompoops bizarre for the nincompoops jamhuri which was unfortunately sheduled to take place at the same time, and not that far away, but in a marginally less pointy part of pointy town, that both the bizarre and the jamhuri had a Kathy Kirby Memorial tent only added to the confusion and the bloodshed. Just in case anything untoward does take place this year, there will be an ambulance on site with a crate of bandages and various gooey substances. The ambulance will be stationed next to or near, or at least in the general vicinity of the inky black fathomless pond teeming with blind slithering horas next to the swings for the duration of the nincompoops bizarre, the swings we chained up on electrified to discourage tinies from frolicking upon them. We do not want any swings and pond mishaps after all. If you're crawling towards where you think the ambulance is, pierced with pointy arrows like st Sebastian and rapidly losing both blood and the will to live, but cannot find the ambulance. listen out for the klaxon. The cracks on his podium is among the stores selling zookeepers, pincushion holders, padlocks, yapping dogs, x box wiring, weird coat hangers, vouchers for dough and godly cravat terps siphons rubber BLT, Bob's quartered pigs, pips or arrays, nothing. Mark lumps, klaxons, drugs in penetrability, a horrid squashed things. glove compartment Tat, Flim Flam ear, wiggly dust, creosote, buzzy bees, and aniseed. Just a reminder that you do not need to be a nincompoop to come to the nincompoops bazaar. for a small fee. You can be made an honorary nincompoop for the day, with a pointy cap and a badge and some embroidered emblems and your arm in a plaster cast and a small sleuthing procedure to your brain through a trap and vent. The trepanning carried out by a qualified nincompoop with a handheld iron pointy, twisty, boring and screwing contraption, dog in a gooey substance and wiped clean with a rag between screenings. for directions to the Julie Felix folk singing and trepanning tent, follow the pointy arrows and the flower beds planted with blue pins and flocks and bind weed and Puglia. One small note about the werewolves patrolling the side fangs bed howling. Remember that these are nincompoop werewolves and generally harmless. They will cease stalking you if you toss them a bucket full of liver and light and other innards from something freshly slaughtered even the innards of a goldfish or a newt will do. It also helps to pack the werewolves on the head as if you are not terrified them and make gurgly cooing noises. Tickets for the nincompoops bazaar are available from a number of points IE kiosk in pointy town and further afield in and pointy places which aspire to pointing us you will require several forms of identity. you will require several forms of identification in order to purchase your tickets. These include a bus pass a three dimensional computer generated hologram of your head, a fistful of your hair torn out at the roots, nail clippings, voice recognition tape recorders, made on a clapped out old cassette player, a letter from your priest, your dental records, a recent utility bill and a replacement bus pass for replacement bus services.

Just one little point about that, I don't know how many of you remember the focusing of Julie Felix. But in that previous piece I put Julie Felix in the focusing and trepanning tent, which is actually a highly plausible scenario, because shortly after her heyday as a folk singer, truly Felix became an very enthusiastic track Hannah, and I think she had several holes bored in her own skull and board holes into other people's skulls. That's entirely true. As is this, I've never watched a single episode of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, so I had no idea who Cockney matriarch Lou Beale was. I do, however, read a bit sharees with great interest, including those of people of whom I've never heard. And so, last week, or possibly the week before, I read the Guardian a victory of animal wing, the actress who played Lou Beale, and I learned that quote, between 1953 and 1960, she was the partner of the surrealist poet Philip O'Connor. And she encouraged him to write his first book, the extraordinary Memoirs of a public baby 1958. Now, not only had I never heard of Anna wing, but I'd never heard of Philip O'Connor either. But my interest was piqued, surrealist poet, author of an extraordinary memoir. And so I looked him up and I found his 1998 obituary in the independent and in this obituary, I learned among other things that his mother abandoned him twice during his childhood, and the second time he was again adopted this time by a one legged bachelor civil servant, who wore size 13 boots and owned a small wooden hut on Box Hill near Dorking. And I learned the impression that he created as a young man in wartime Fitzrovia was of utter precariousness as thin as a skeleton. His face already eroded his smile, never calm. He lived off doughnuts and wood binds ogled at women and spoken cryptograms spoonerisms and jingles, delivering sentences backwards and falling about in drunken exhilaration. And I learned many people knew him simply as the man who stood behind the door and said, boo to TS Eliot. Now who could read those snippets and not want to read the memoirs? Self consciously, bohemian drunkard poets are invariably tiresome, particularly when convinced of their own genius. And no doubt in person. Philip O'Connor was a Stephen spender says in his introduction to the memoirs, a menace. But they can also sometimes write wonderful books and Memoirs of a public baby. What I've read of it so far is one. Other Half of the book is devoted to Philip O'Connor's prematurity, taking him up to his teenage years, we learn of his lasting fear of monkeys, feeling horribly near to them, and that I have a secret they might discover, which would involve me in some unconscious activity consequent upon the discovery of a bond between us. For all the examination of is in a life, written with forensic acuity, mercifully free of Freud the platitudes he's also splendid when describing the external scene, that little wooden hat on Box Hill, where he lived with his one legged Guardian, for example.

The hot on the Hill was in a fairly detached part of a holiday camp, the most selective Roll on this hill in sorry, the signs of this selectiveness with a wide spaces between the hearts, their decorum in color and lack of fantasy and architecture. And the absence of radios, though loudspeaker was still young, like the last speaker was still young, and the quality and size of the cars arriving at weekend and the good quality plus fours of the youngest set. They were in fact of the class most disliked by my guardian, mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers who may also didn't like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp, except a certain Scoutmaster. This was the quintessence of scout masters, and I feel certain he came from Roehampton because of a particular greenhouse wildness in his appearance, I caught him acquiring a tropical tan artfully behind a bush once he liked to stand most direct on the brow of the plateau and scan the horizon. eyes narrowed, ready, I believe for eventualities. As for the Guardian himself, it was around this year 1927 that my guardian considered Madame blavatsky spiritual realism, psycho analysis, fascism, communism and Philately. The last two were to enjoy. I Connor is sent to the school at the bottom of the hill. As I was to discover a typical ecclesiastical laundry of wreck sign culture for the soaping out of human goosies. These brief extract alone convinced me that Philip O'Connor is worth rescuing from obscurity. And if that weren't enough, there's a passing remark in the independent of victory, where we're told that in later life he dabbles interestingly with chickens.

I was accused by a hooting yard reader of somehow having perpetrated a hoax by planting a 1998 a big theory in the independent, but I can assure you that like Julie Felix and her scowl boring adventures. All of that is entirely true. And I do recommend Memoirs of a public baby all our suspect is out of print. I got mine from the library. Speaking of truth, excuse me. I can't remember if I mentioned this last week, I may have done. I was reading about the annual Swan upping on the Thames, and it reminded me of an amusing Swan related matter which I had unaccountably forgotten to mention, at least I think I forgot to mention it. During the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, I forget what game exactly though it may have been one of the men's semi finals. During one of the breaks between sets. The BBC cameras drifted off to the surrounding scene, and showed a jetty by the river around which sunbathers sprawled. Also present was a swamp, approached by a tiny tot who looked as if she was wanting to feed you to sandwich. The proximity of taught to Swan lead one of the commentary team to observe that belying their elegance and grace. swans are of course, savage and aggressive creatures. Whereupon fellow commentator Tim Henman, a man whose surname suggests he knows a thing or two about birds, or at least about poultry. Said, and I'm paraphrasing this from memory, but it's pretty accurate. I think. This is Tim Henman. Whenever you see a swan someone always points out that they're capable of breaking your arm. Have you ever met anybody who's had their arm broken bias one I haven't. Sadly, the Cameras then returned to the tennis and we were not treated to any further Swan talk from hand man. But anyway, all very interesting. I think. I was inspired by Tim Hinman's comment to write a little story. It's called Swan and it for Tim Henman. I was walking along the towpath of the old canal when suddenly and out of nowhere and mad and Swan came flapping at me in stormy rage, and thumped me so hard with its wing that it broke my arm. confound you swan. I cried in my distress. But the swamp had already returned to the canal gliding through the water, a vision of elegance. by one of those curious coincidences with which my life is stippled the physician who tended to my fractured bone at the canalside clinic was called Dr. Swan fracture. I suppose you must have the set quite a few bones broken by swans, I said, through the haze of anesthetic with which I had been unnecessarily injected. Actually, you're the first such a patient I've had to attend to in 20 years of practice at this clinic said Dr. Swan fracture. For the swans on this canal are known for their placidity. There is perhaps something in the canal water. Later convalescing shattered on an Alpine balcony. I reflected on this, and my reflections were unhappy ones. If Dr. Swan fracture was correct, and the canal swans were planted, then what had I done to provoke one of them to such uncharacteristic violence frenzy? Or was it not something I had done? But simply me my being my essential self? Was I without realizing it, a danger to swans, a source of fear to swans. A man can come on down when faced with such an uncomfortable truth about himself. And I did indeed come on Dan. I raved. I spluttered. And I rolled about it never occurred to me that Dr. Swan fracture was talking through his hat.

Many years past, the majority of them spent trust and medicated and bewildered in a series of lunatic asylums before one day, I was visited by an ornithologist. This saintly chap was convinced that the mad and the lunatic and the bewildered, could be brought to their senses through a better appreciation of birds. He was who enlightened me regarding the ineradicable savagery of swans. When I explained that I'd been told there was something in the canal water that made placid, the swans that glades air in he laughed like a drain. When eventually his gurgling ceased, he said he'd never heard such poppycock in his life. There is no drug on Earth, he said, that could pacify a swan. Indeed, his own studies had shown that the only way to render a swan harmless was to ring it graceful neck. Dr. Swan fractures neck was anything but graceful. Rather, it was scrawny and be pimpled and wrinkled. As I learned when I clamped my hairy hands around it and run it, having Stretton into the canal side clinic, and through his waiting room, were sat several patients, nursing Swan broken arms.

That's nearly all we have time for, but I should tell you what I'll be doing over the next week. My latest project is to stage a series of Tableau vivaan. These will take place today. Ideally over the coming week and each one will last for a duration of no more than one minute. At a push of various locations in the hustle and bustle of the London streets. Each one will be a vivid static solo reenactment of a significant historical event. I have thus far chosen six subject, the death of Socrates, the sinking of the Lusitania the Punic Wars, the relief of Matthew King, the second resignation of David Blunkett, and my first truck eyes, and I asked readers of the hooting yard website for suggestions for the seventh and final tableau, the Vaughn which should be hopefully more vivid, and more historically significant than the other sick, and I've got a number of replies. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have time to read all of them. Someone who wish to remain anonymous, suggested the expulsion of Lucifer from heaven, the invention of the whale and stout Cortez with eagle eyes, wild surmise, staring at the Pacific. And Dave cranmer, a man who has it in his time invented musical instruments that look like weasels or stoats. I can't quite remember he did a theramin. That was a badger. That's right, a badger theramin. Anyway, Dave cranmer suggested choc ice number two porpoises rescued Dick Van Dyke to destruction by fire of Vaughn Campbell and Mechanical Turk. And Emerson, Lake and Palmer releasing pictures at an exhibition. Actually, he also mentioned Pliny the Elder writing about soil for the first time. And truck is number seven. But I'm afraid that's all we've got time for this week. So if you haven't, but if you have any suggestions for my seventh and final Tableau vivaan please write to me at hooting dot yard@gmail.com. And don't forget, you can always donate money to both resonance, which is very helpful at the resonance website and to hooting yard, which is even more helpful. The hooting odd website maybe sometime over August. If you get brain sick from the sun, you might be so brain sick that you'll accidentally hit one of those PayPal buttons and send money to me and or resonance. That's it, um, until September possibly, depending on whether I'm in the new shedule Bye bye.
