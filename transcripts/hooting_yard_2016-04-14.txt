Hello, this is resonance FM retina resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. If you're listening on a digital device, my name is Frank key. This is hooting yard. And this is a quote from 16 months in for German prisons by Frederick Arthur Ambrose Torbert. I sat down upon my bed with my bleeding, aching head in my hands, an object of abject misery. No sound beyond the clanging of doors was to be heard, punctuated at frequent intervals by the Dow font of blows, as some hapless wreck was being clubbed the shrieks and howls of prisoners, and the groans of those on the verge of insanity. It was just as if all the demons of the nether regions were at work, worrying and hurrying their victims. While rocking myself to and fro, I heard the turning of the key. The jailer entered with a bowl containing some evil looking and worst smelling soup. Well, poor Frederick Arthur Ambrose Tolbert from his from his book, 16 months in for German prisons. We will return to that book, actually, right away right now. Because Dobson was a great admirer of this book, and he planned to write a sequel and titled four months in 16 German prisons. To this end, he arrived in all on a bright spring morning and began to write an inflammatory pamphlet hoping to be placed under arrest. His plan succeeded brilliantly, and by midday, he had been banged up in the jog. He laid back on the cold stone bench in his cell and smiled. Then, before a guard arrived with a 10 bowl of evil looking and worst smelling soup, the pamphleteer took from a secret compartment in his shoe, or notepad and pencil, and wrote day one in prison in all, one down 15 prisons to go soup drew soon. At the time of which I write Dobson was young and impact us and he had not bothered to research the German penal system, particularly that part of it related to the transfer of convict between prisons. He was later to reflect ruefully on his Neva T. I thought I would be able to get myself moved from prison to prison, just by asking nicely he wrote, but I recommend without the inhuman, mechanically creaking wheels of Teutonic jurisprudence. It must be said that this is a somewhat melodramatic evasion. What actually happened was that hold before a caught within two hours of his incarceration. Dobson was condemned as an idiotic nuisance and ejected from the country. He was placed on a prison ship, which sailed him home in time for tea.

Here's another quotation this one from Robert Howlett book, The School of recreation to make stars that will expand in flame and appear like natural stars in the firmament for a time. Take half a pound of saltpeter the like quantity of brimstone finally beaten together, sifted and mingled with a quarter of a pound of gunpowder, so ordered. Then wrap up the composition in the linen rags or fine paper to the quantity of worn that bind them with small thread and prick holes in the rag or paper with a botkin and placed six or 10 of them on the head of a great rocket as you did the quills and when the rocket expires like Mike fire and spread into a flame hovering in the air like stars and descend literally till the matter is spent that gives them the light and I think that's a very good measurement of quantity, isn't it the quantity of a walnut

be out I'll go on. Here is a simple and costume This is not by Robert Howlett, but it might as well be here is a simple and cost effective way to cause harm to your enemy. All you will need is some wax or a few pins. And I Hank of your enemies hair or a scrap from clothing they have worn or some other item imbued with their spirit or Geist. You may protest as so many people do, that you have not an enemy in the world, that your sunny disposition and active arms giving mean that no one wishes you Ill matches I would like this to be true. It is extremely unlikely. At one time or another, all of us have made enemies. Perhaps there was a time when you struck clunk rather than clang during bell ringing. And I'm so offended the ears of your captain that he has hated you ever since with a low thing that grows by the day. Or you may have inadvertently bashed into and maimed a goat while cycling at high speed. Remember that collision. And there is a farmer who spent his lonely nights cursing you to hell. You could even have made an enemy by stealing a BonBon from the mouth of a tiny tot, a mischievous deed that you have since forgotten, but as a lead that infant now a grown adult to harbor a burning indignation, which has quite distorted her life. So do not think you have no photos and do not think yourself innocent and safe. There are people bent on revenge, and they will stop at nothing. And the best way to protect yourself is to cause them harm before they steal upon you at dead of night and smother you with your own pillow. obtaining your wax and pins couldn't be easier. You can get wax from a wax Chandler or you can just melt a few candles until they're soft enough to mold. You do not need a great deal of wax as your goal will only be a tiny thing, like a little Incubus. Ideally, you should be able to hold it in one hand while cackling and slobbering you drive the pins home with the fingers of your other hand. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. I will assume you have the wax and means of heating it. Bunsen burners is found in the laboratories of boffins both mad and otherwise useful for this part of the project. Or you may prefer to use your gas cooker at home. Do remember to pay your gas bill though. If you neglected your gas provider may cut off your supply and you will be left with wax to hard to mold into a doll. When you have malleable wax, fashioned it with your fingers and thumbs into a basic simulacrum of a human being. It need not be an accurate representation of your enemy, unless they have a particularly noticeable physical floor, such as a missing limb or a giant swollen head. In most cases, a standard humanoid shape will suffice. Some correspondents have asked me if the little doll which you will pay us with sharp pins to harm your phone can be made out of plasticine, or some other proprietary modeling clay suitable for infants and for those embarking on a course of physical therapy in an institution for the bewildered the straightforward answer is no, no 1000 times No, this is you must always, always use wax for various something weird and even sinister about wax. Now about those pins, you can get pins from any old haberdasher or needlework shop from anywhere in fact, which sells pins for innocent domestic purposes. So long as the pins are about Metal, you can't really go wrong. But if you have a flair for wickedness, you might want to use special zoll tan pins. These are manufactured especially for plunging remorselessly into wax and images for nefarious purposes. And the makers promise faster and more decisive result. independent studies have not been able to uphold such claims. Alas. And it may be that the Zoltan Payne's people are guilty of hyperbole and guff. I leave the choice to you.

One parents article note, you must use pins or not nails. If you try to press nails into your wax doll, you are making a category error. Nails exist to be driven into mud idols for quite other purposes. There was a time when children learned the useful phrase, pins for wax nails for mud, as soon as they could speak, but that seems to be one of those pieces of traditional wisdom. We have lost in our pap in golf world. It'll be to be revived. Starting now. painters for wax nails for mud. So you have your doll and you have your pins. Most important of all you have your enemy. Whether it be the village wrestler who wants scolded you as he frolicked in the graveyard, or the pilot of a jet aircraft whose uniform cap you tipped off his head and kicked along the street as he made his way home after flying his Spy Plane deep into enemy airspace. Now you have to imbue that little wax doll with the spirit of your phone. You will not be bringing the doll to life exactly like some sort of wax and Pinocchio, but it needs to lose its anonymity and be clearly identified with your enemy. You can do this by attaching to it that Hank of hair or scrap of clothing I mentioned earlier, or some other unique item, I shall leave it to your finely honed wits to work out how to obtain such a thing. Unless you're really a barber or dry cleaner. You may need to employ a private detective or as a treatment option hire the services of a near do well hopefully avoid having somehow instilled your doll with the Geist of your phone. You are now last ready to pierce it with pins. Go on, stick them in your face or to take on an expression of evil concentration and you may even cackle, but you do not need to have a bubbling cauldron of some foul eldritch potion at your side. That is me a Wednesday. opinions differ as to how you may judge the efficacy of the operation somehow, but success consists in gaining immediate results. So the very instant you stick a pin into your doll's leg, your enemy feels a sharp Pang in the same spot. Others contend that a pin so placed will lead to your foe breaking their leg in the near future. There is no foolproof way of influencing the precise kind of harm your enemy will come to. You need to trust in the invisible powers of the cosmos in much the same way as lovable disc jockey and television personality. Now Edmunds does through his adherents to the cosmic ordering service.

They were torn down long ago, but the slovenly jubitz standing high on the hill still haunt the history of this file and silhouetted against the leaden sky. The slovenly gibbet creaked in the wind, and did so for years and years, but they're gone now. They're destroyed. traction was tiny in its first recorded act of heroism. She was just eight years old, and were sat in the kitchen of the cabin at the foot of those grim hills, eating her milk slots for breakfast, when loud clanking and clunking noises accompanied by shouts and screams letter outside. In the pale light of dawn, she saw malefactors being dragged up the hill in trains by principal jenseits henchmen. Why things some spilled slops off a polka dot shift with an old rag. she confronted the henchmen whose tabard was emblazoned with a captain's crest what crimes have these sorry looking wretches committed? Oh captain, she typed in her shrill infantile voice. The hench Captain growled at her, and one of his fellow henchmen picked her up with one mighty hairy hand and salobre data. And Hand me brute, cried tiny Enid, at which a silent cackled. He carried her over to the roaring River, which crashed with such ferocity down the hillside, and was about to throw her in when, with great presence of mind, the tiny child unlaced the big black corrective boot in which her club foot was encased, eased it off and bashed the henchmans facing so violently that he dropped her at once, on the springy green grass, replacing her big boot in one sprightly movement, tiny Enid clumped over to the captain and rebuked him. It is our uncommon good fortune that one of the other henchmen was carrying a portable metal Tapping Machine, to which was attached to a recording device. In an uncanny parallel with the dictaphone belt of Dallas police officer wb McLean, which inadvertently recorded the assassination of President john F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza on the 22nd of November 1963. That henchmans device was jammed in the on position with us know the precise words with which tiny Enid upbraided to the captain. You should be mightily ashamed of yourself. Oh, Captain, she said, for allowing one of your men to manhandle me. I am but a tiny infant in a polka dot shift. And he is a gigantic fellow. Had I not had my wits about me. Even now I would be gurgling at the bottom of the terrifying river, the life draining out of me. Instead, it is your cruel colleague who was toppled to the earth covered in his own Gore. He will live I think, though he's already ugly mug will be further disfigured. Hmm, perhaps the imprint of my big black boot will improve his appearance. Now captain, you too will feel my Roth unless you loose the manacles from this piteous gaggle of wrongdoers, and release them into my care. Release them I say, or you will go the way of tahltan and scoby and o hoolahan.

Some truth the terror with which the captain heard these words, that he crumpled to the ground suddenly puny and powerless, but not before he had tossed two tiny Enid the keys to the manacles which chained his prisoners, before setting them free. The heroic infant question each one closely about their crimes, learning that they were all but simple peasants who had stolen a potato or a lettuce or defaced a big portrait of principal Geneseo with boot polish, or just had a general air of rural besmirch meant about them. And when all their trains were loosed, she set them the task of tearing down the slovenly gallows up on the grim, horrible Hill, and she watched a while her big black booty clubfoot resting on the neck of the captain, before kicking him once in the head and skipping in our ungainly manner. Back to her cabin, and her kitchen and her breakfast of milk slops.

I don't know about you, but given that that was published in 1844, they sound pretty pricey. Those random The days but I think I might get some of the the bomb of sorry Arkham sounds just might not just what's needed for me here to finish this week show to end this week show. Here's some ice cream or extract from Mr. K shorter, potted brief, brief lives the book that came out last year and has been a decisive non bestseller. But who cares it's it's a good book and you should buy a copy. Norman Tebbit English politician born 1931. In 2010 tibbett prompted the glorious headline Norman Tebbit attacks trials in Dragon outfit. The story below explained somewhat disappointingly, that he was so upset by the noise caused by a Chinese New Year celebration near his home that he ran 100 yards down the street, grabbed a drum that someone was banging, and planted a kick on the backside of a dancing dragon without realizing a little boy was in the side. I think the idea of Norman Tebbit attacking a drawl while wearing a dragon outfit is far more enticing. And then of course, there's Cyrus Reed teed an American Messiah 1839 to 1908. Cyrus Reed teed devised koresh anity, which taught that the earth is hollow, and that we live on the inner surface. Outside the sphere, there is nothing It was more than merely a scientific theory, however, to be explained, to no of the earth concavity is to know God while to believe in the earth convexity is to deny him and all his works. All that is opposed to Cora sanity is antichrist. He founded a colony of believers in Florida, planning for 8 million to be accommodated, but only 200 turned up. The colony survived remarkably, until 1961. And oh, yes, here's a good one Roger Waters English musician born 1943. Aged 18, Roger Waters was imprisoned and kept in irons for more than a year. Oh, dammit. Unfortunately, this was not the Pink Floyd person, but a 16th century separatist Puritan of the same name. I street wells, English writer 1866 to 1946. Wells was bothered by shaving, washing, answering letters, talking to people doing up parcels and finding pieces of string or envelopes or stamps. One of his lesser known works is his 1933 novel, The bumping ton of blop subtitled adventures poses stresses, conflict and disaster in a contemporary brain. And I'd like to tell you that I have in fact, read that book, and it's actually quite enjoyable. And that's the end of this week's show. I'll be back next week, so long as I have the bomb of Syria or Cody or bomb of Syria. I better get some of that. Have some of that and then I'll be fit enough to return to the studio next week. Bye bye.
