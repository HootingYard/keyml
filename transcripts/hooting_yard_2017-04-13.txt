Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air or hooting yard in the electromagnetic field or, or just hanging out with some phrase of your own addition. And yes, so here we are for another week. And I Oh, was the date today? I think if I'm if my calculations are correct, tomorrow is the 13th anniversary of the first ever hooting out on the air. So this is our 13th birthday show. I only just realized that as I said it. Yes. Now hosting yard is now a recalcitrant teenager. I haven't thought about that until I just realized, as I said it had I had I thought about it, I would have planned a special teenage edition of routing yard on the air, but I didn't anyway, and at some point in the last 13 years, I talked to you about hiking pickles. And today I want to address the equally important topic of putting flaps flaps about putting a rarer than they once were. chiefly because puddings play a less critical role in our diets than used to be the case. There was a time when no meal was innocent of a pudding. And of course not every pudding preparation was the occasion of a flap. The incidence of such flaps was obviously more frequent. One or two psycho Coventry statisticians have attempted to put a precise figure on the occurrence of pudding flaps, and one feels pity for them. Pity mixed with mocking laughter. Sooner or later, I think we're gonna have to accept that we will never know how often the making of a pudding was done in a state of flap, certainly not to a statistically significant extent. The implications of this are of course that I may be able to say nothing pertinent about putting flaps safe or what I've already said that they used to be more common than they are in the gilded paradise we live in today. And it is a sort of Eden as we zoom around the glistening Metropolis in bendy hover buses. Printing are Buffon's with space age premium tweezers, scanning the electronic information silos for the latest diktats from our supreme leader. The great helmed woman the Hazel Blears, plugging our pods into hubs in during cataclysmic hail storms with undiminished Jawad Aviv, and taking our state provided one pig per person, policy pig for a brisk walk through the concrete underpasses below the boulevards. Yet Some say it's a fool's paradise and they may be right. Perhaps there is a deep, primeval human need to get into a flap when preparing a pudding. Whether it's a pudding of spirit, or of plums or a greasy slots are loss of those flaps, at least in our daily lives has cost us dear.

A topic of consuming interest or a number of people is the manner in which detective Captain card pan cut his crime fighting chops. So impassioned are some that there is a weekly magazine to cater that to their needs, and titled over Oh karg pan that you were with us still, in which beetle browed fans with nothing better to do publish lengthy and Frankly tedious disquisitions upon me earlier cases of the renowned copper. A short extract will suffice to give you some idea of the content. And I quote, later that Sava karg pan was assigned to the team which had been trying fruitlessly to solve the mysterious case of the pod persons from poor luck. acting on a tip off from combine, the ambitious young detective took fruit with him to his first briefing. His plans were bruised, but it calculated correctly, that the investigation would no longer be fruitless. His colleagues on the case were Kandinsky for Russia, pabulum squit, crane neck, Solomon Gilly Blatt hinges, Darjeeling men Santa, Fe, Femi pap kuben, who bin Farah potente COC and cribben wesc, flopper Ruskin Whistler, Pinkerton Paris, Paris periscope boo boo concept album. Where with all fanfares desk Sergeant grease jacket, desk Sergeant grease jacket performing monkey flamboyant man, Elspeth duck wind loving grow rata last Pompidou and vampire threadbare pot DAC snap tittle POM for long risk assessor cow fat loon Hoon battlin goon Fang Chow Hong rip, Kim Park goon trilby Baxter sup swap Shandy merriness wall gatherer poopy plus a buck popsy Clutterbuck crippled nephew Simon, whose name was Peter, a pool of Condit temporary volunteers, and some horses all under the command of super Captain Fastow copy, no relation to the legendary cyclist of that name. This is the kind of thing the old card pan rat Valois with us still readers adore. No doubt it took prodigious research to compile that list of team members, some of which I miss read because of my eyesight, but those of us with a less specialist approach are left wondering how or even if the case of the pod persons from porlock was solved. The author of the piece does not tell us nor does she follow up the ramifications of cargo pants provision of a basket of fruit. Later in his career, of course, like many fictional detectives, Detective Captain card pan had a trusty assistant of Watson is hones, you will find no mention of beppo in the umpteen thousand pages of the bound volumes of oak argh Pam that they're with us still held in the reference library at pointy town, nor in any of the myriad other journals devoted to the cutting of car bands crime fighting cops. beppo was not yet born when the great detective joined the Constabulary, and it was not until the famous case of the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant that the diminutive helpmeet appeared on the scene. Interestingly, this case is one that the aforementioned Dr. Watson attributed in passing to Sherlock Holmes, Watson made this something of a habit, for he also tried to claim credit for a number of karg pannon beppo adventures, including the singular fare of the elementium crotch, the repulsive story of the red leech the terrible death of Crosby, the banker, the arrest of Wilson and notorious Canary trainer, and the one in which is adore paronto, the well known journalist and dualist with found Stark staring mad with a maxbox in front of him, which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science.

Frank Key  09:25
Such true life tales of detection and derring do have thrills generations. What is less well known is that when karg pan eventually retired from the force, and went off to some rustic backwater to keep bees and wasps beppo stuck struck out on his own as a private investigator. Very few of his solo adventures have ever been made public, possibly due to their unremitting tedium. Poor Beto was unfortunate in that he was only ever employed by clients fretting about the state of their taps or their hedges, or a defective electric socket, or a cat in a tree or a loss bus path. He took a drink, and was last heard of wandering aimlessly around the gloomy suburbs of 10. Tara been emitting Noxious Fumes with every breath and shouting is head office snack bar hooligans.

john and i have just been discussing the great biblical mystery of Simon, whose name was Peter. I mean, was it Simon? Or was it Peter? Which one? It's not like. Hi, I'm Frank key whose name is Peter Robotham.

Unknown Speaker  11:16
Or am I? Well, yes, so that's the problems of growing up in going to a Catholic school. Well, who is one of them? One of them one of them? Yes. Well, Simon, his name is Peter. Well, which is it? Exactly. And they never do tell you.

Frank Key  11:34
They never tell you by keep it under their hat or Cardinals Beretta long Batman cloak. Yes. We could have an entire show about being Catholic. Because it is quite for those of you who aren't Catholic. Believe me believe you, me and believe you, john. It's it's quite something because

Unknown Speaker  12:02
it's hard to describe if you didn't go for it. Really?

Frank Key  12:07
Yeah, and in some ways, unbelievable. People may find it hard to believe some of the that was an interesting noise that was the scape outside with a load of religious ephemera being tossed in but not but not Catholic ephemera? Unfortunately. Yes, Simon, whose name was Peter? great mystery. Moving on, though, seem to have lost my place. Oh, here we are. Dobson's six lectures on fruit, were among the most highly regarded of his works held in an esteem that the contemporary reader finds unfathomable.

Frank Key  13:05
revisiting these pamphlets, it swiftly becomes apparent that Dobson has no idea what he's talking about. The revised view of the lectures is put best by one upstart young Dobson scholar who dismisses them as bloviating and orotund. Consider the first lecture on the putting of fruit into pies, in which Dobson challenges the accepted definitions of both fruit and pies, not to mention the usual meanings of the verb to put. Some critics like to pretend that the essay is a precursor of what would become known as post modernism or deconstruction, and in as much as is clueless jibberish by are correct. In his defense, the pamphleteer does not dress up his babble in needlessly complicated pseudo academic jargon. Indeed, his language is direct, even earthy and littered with harsh Anglo Saxon expletives. But he betrays depths of almost unimaginable ignorance. The climax of the lecture is supposed to be a recipe for what Dobson calls a prune and lemon pastry explosion. But the instructions are so befogged by weightlessness, that, to my knowledge, no one has ever succeeded in making it. The genesis of the six lectures was an invitation to Dobson from the orchard persons of the port tongs. Those of you familiar with the geography of this wretched seaside town will know that it is bounded on its eastern landward side by a terrific number. of orchard. orchard. Persons social club and community center was situated in a clearing between a pear orchard and a persimmon orchard, and the usual entertainment hosted with knights of unpark on par music and freakish dancing. Perhaps that is why Dobson chose to deliver his second lecture on the cutting of grapefruit into segments of equal size in the form of rhyming couplets, to the accompaniment of a glockenspiel. He was not a skilled glockenspiel list, nor did he have much understanding of geometry as those orchard persons discovered who went home and tried to cut their grapefruit the Dobson way. For the third and fourth lectures, Dobson resorted to anecdote and personal reminiscence recounting a series of yarns under the headings, all the plums I have ever eaten, where I was and what they tasted like, and how I built a coat hanger out of fig stones. audiences were dwindling By this time, and only three people turned up to listen to what was to become the most notorious of the lectures, the dialogue between a raspberry and a tangerine. Even those who are most severely critical of the series, are forced to admit that Dobson did a tremendous amount of research for this one. He was barely out of the reading room of the pointy town municipal library for weeks on end, poring over books on topics as diverse as fruit for latterly biochemistry, aerodynamics, the peninsula wars, tug boats, flamenco dancing, and the Diet of Worms. But it's claimed to have penetrated the very essence of a raspberry and a tangerine, a quite frankly ludicrous. marigold to told him so as I ate breakfast on a hopeless veranda on the morning before the lecture. Dobson response was the week great wracking sobs and his bowl of Special K. He spent all day making revisions to the text, some of which have a certain Jesuit ethical rigor, and by the time he arrived at the clearing between parents persimmon orchards, he was brimming with confidence. preposterous it may be, but the dialogue between a raspberry and a tangerine retains to this day a kind of magnificent declamatory breo. lengthy extracts from the lecture formed the libretto of a concept album by prog rock Titans, gratuitous on loud.

Frank Key  17:56
The published edition of six lectures on fruit contained only the text of the first five lectures. Some Dominic Dobson 's have argued that the sixth in the series never actually existed, that Dobson had some kind of brain spasm, and that all knowledge of fruit was wiped from his mind. He v van boo did manage to spread this story in a foolish conspiracy theory novel, but he overlooks the fact that the pamphleteer was never a man to let ignorance stop him expounding at length on any subject he turned his mind to. What in fact happened was that when Dobson arrived in the clearing on the final Thursday, he found the doors of the social club barred and bolted, and no one in sight. Even the birds had fled from their purchase on the trees that fringe the clearing. Dobson took one look at the mighty iron padlock on the door, reached into his satchel took out the notes of his sixth and final lecture, some drivel about bananas or mama made and tore them into confetti, and cast them onto the winds. And then he trudged off into one of the orchards and shook a branch until pears and persimmons came tumbling to earth, and he sat on a tuffet and gorged himself on fruit until he was bloated and bloated, he waddled homewards along the lane, out of the orchard, body and brain with fruit, bloated

Nobody knew when's in spirit fled. He was last seen at one end of sawdust bridge. But it was a fugitive sighting. It was not clear whether he was at the pointy end of the bridge or at the point here and whichever end it was one moment in spit was there and the next he was not, and nobody knew when he fled. In the days before his fleeing it was sort of in spirit that he was in the doldrums. But this was a miss hearing. He was not in the doldrums, but on the dole drums. He was pounding out a hot job boo hoo Dre beat on a tiny drum kit, usually played by a doll. Its arms controlled puppet style by strings manipulated by an adept in spit, snatched the drums from the doll and pop them in his pocket and took them to his lair. Now that he knew where in spit layer lay, there were rumors that it was concealed in the shadows under the pointy end of sawdust bridge. Others had it and then to the blister lane bypass. After inspect fled, the sheriff organized a posse to search for the mayor. It proved fruitless like the sheriff's diet. I once ate an apple said the sheriff. Never again. Now I know how Eve felt he was a fallen man the sheriff, unlike in spip, who was not a trail of scattered towns led to a bog mod on the filthy canal. But this proved to be a red herring. See Nash's Lenten stuff? Thomas Nash 1599 Nonetheless, the barge was ransacked and turned upside down in the hunt for clues. They found a dolt drumstick, a chicken bone, with the chicken killed by inspected before he fled. The posse fell upon an outlying bomb, hence the well known song, the sheriff's posse in the barn with it hot job boo hoo Dre beat an emotionally wrenching lyrics and 20 guitar part. In the end, it turned out that in spirit fled where Eagles dare to the teeth and calling himself by turns broadsword or Danny boy. The name in spirit was erased even from his metal tag, such as the mystery of the patron saint of kickin Stranglers. There is not even a memorial plaque on sawdust bridge, either at the pointy end, or at the pointy end,

received an invitation to attend the swish sophisticated cocktail party. And I decided to wear for the occasion my second best bib and Tucker. On the evening itself with the party in full swing. I was leaning in suit alias on the evening itself, with the party in full swing. I was leaning insouciantly against a mantle piece. When I was approached by a fellow guest. You are a grown man, she said. Why are you wearing a bib? I embarked upon a lengthy explanation of the phenomenon known as involuntary slobbering citing certain vivid examples, both from my own experience and from the historical records. I pressed on for quite some time holding my interlocutors spellbound, until one of my exemplary slobbering vignettes caused her to interrupt me. spiral Agnew. She cried so loudly that she caught the attention of guests on the far side of the room. Indeed, so I said, and I will not qualify my assertion with that weasel word allegedly. At Miss, she executed a startled that'll jump and confessed to a terrible fear of weasels. I told her like only alarmed me when they went pop up and down the city road. More than once I added such weasel popping had caused me to slobber in voluntarily. I was pleased momentarily to have brought the conversation back to my chosen topic, but my new companion was now fixated upon weasels, and insisted I joined her in a search and destroy mission in case any weasels had infiltrated the cocktail party. With what I asked, shall we destroy any weasels we might hunt down? Well, she said, What is that? And she pointed to my Tucker. That is my second best, Tucker, I said. It goes with the bib. We can use it to smother any weasels we find she cried, and she took me by the hand and removed me away from the drawing room towards another part of the house, where she hinted there might be weasels. I never did get the chance to finish my exemplary slobbering vignette featuring the 39th, Vice President of the United States of America. But the weasel frightened lady gave me her telephone number. So one evening soon, I will call her and tell her the rest of that tale and several others until the cows come home.

And finally, this week, we have a little we have a little piece of a piece of information about Anthony Burgess, always worth a laugh. And Has anyone noticed that Anthony Burgess and Mark E. Smith, are beginning to resemble each other. Or Marquis Smith is beginning to look like, like Anthony Burgess. Anyway. Anyway, there was a book, book review, I read about a couple of different books on on color, colors. And in among always, obviously, there was some talk of synesthesia and included this great quotation about Anthony Burgess, written by Steven Bailey, I once saw the novelist Anthony Burgess, settled down at a concert grand, put a reproduction of Turner's the fighting camera on the music stand and play the picture in a camp, but straight faced demonstration of synesthesia, as ever with Burgess, you were not quite sure if he was taking the Mick. And I think that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. First teenager edition. And because I as I said, I think tomorrow the 14th of April is the not only Good Friday, but it's also the the 13th anniversary of the first hooting out on the air show here on resonance. So that's the end of the show for this week. And but when we come back, we'll be will be 13 and a bit. Bye bye.
