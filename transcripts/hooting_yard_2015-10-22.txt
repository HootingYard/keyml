And this isn't Fenella fielding This is Frank k with hooting yard on the air. Good evening, and we're going to start this week with some more brief brief lives. These are taken from Mr. Keys shorter potty, the brief brief lives out now from constable books governed by an independent bookshop, or if you can't drag your bones to a bookshop, go online to any online book retailer and buy a copy. And I've been reading a few each week and we're up to the letter G. So here is Harrison. Here are some brief lives of people whose names begin with G, Gemma galgani, Italian st and mystic 1878 to 1903. Gemma galgani shorter life was filled with mystic visions of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the devil. She managed to fight off the temptations of the latter. Despite suffering from tuberculosis. She was able to levitate and was occasionally to be found in midair, clutching a large crucifix hanging on the wall of her parents living room. passionately kissing the wound in Christ's side.

Okay, keep my Petula Clark files in a remote secure storage facility. The perimeter fence is electrified and patrolled by wolves. The wolves are not electrified, but I'm working on it in partnership with the animal behaviorist and amateur electrician, Walter mad. The wolves have been trained to become doe silent my approach, but to attack savagely anybody else, including Walter mad. The combination of fence and wolves, and some fairly stout padlocks ensures that my Petula Clark files remain safe and secure. It is 50 years since I began my collection. There was a brief report in the local newspaper of the seaside town in which I then lived, announcing a forthcoming concert by Petula Clark I snipped it Out of the paper with a pair of scissors and put it on my desk under a seaside pebble. Over the following few months, I snipped out various papers several reports in which Petula Clark was mentioned. Some of these were illustrated with photographs of the Shawn ters, though the photographs themselves were of low quality, as well most newspaper photographs in those days. By the time I had accumulated five or six, such as snippy G's, I lost all interest in Petula Clark. Looking back, it's fair to say that I was never particularly interested in her in the first place. I spent far more of my time for example, thinking about and studying and even attempting to imitate the behavior of wolves. Eventually, one blazing summer mourn. I looked at the seaside pebble on my desk, and the five or six press clippings related to Petula Clark underneath it, and are resolved with a sort of manually jack Hawkins stone gourd resolve to find a more efficient storage method for them. After all, it had occurred to me more than once that were right to move the seaside pebble for any reason, and my window was open, and a gust of wind blew in billowing the curtains, the cuttings, all five or six of them could be scattered untidily and perhaps, perhaps be lost forever. Hence the files by which I refer to bath cardboard folders. I bought a packet of these at a Stationers. I distinctly recall that on my way, to on my walk to and fro the shop, which took about 15 minutes each way. I didn't see a single wolf. This saddened me, but I was consoled on the way back that I had acquired a suitable means of storage for my collection of five or six Petula Clark press clippings. I was so eager to return to home and set to work that I did not as I usually did stop off at the ice cream kiosk to buy a truck ice, which I would then eat while sitting on a seaside bench and staring out to see Walter mad has hatched a scheme to use half eaten choc ices as bait in the process of electrifying wolves. I must admit I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I feel sure it is sound. one's home and having unwrapped from their cellophane the bath cardboard folders. I took five or six of them and placed a particular clock snippet into each one. Having first of course moved the seaside pebble to one side on my desk. I considered marking the folders, for example by writing, Petula Clark press clipping number one, and so on up to number five or number six on the front of each one. But I decided against this. My decision was might be easier because at the time, I recall I had mislaid my pencil, and I only discovered it some days later, tucked against the wind Scott on the opposite side of the room. How it came to rest there, I shall never know. I placed the folders in one of the desk drawers made a cup of tea and settled back to gaze at the picture book of wolves I had borrowed from the seaside library. The book was long overdue, but I was young and feckless and reckless, and I did not give a hoot.

Despite the fact that I no longer had any interest in Petula Clark, my collection was not yet complete. About three years later, riffling through a color supplement, I came upon a quarter page color photograph of the star, and in a sudden frenzy, as if gripped by demons, I reached for my scissors and snipped it out. Fortunately, in spite of the passing of the years, I have the remainder of the buff cardboard folders close to hand, I took one place to cut a photograph of Petula Clark inside it and added it to the collection in the desk drawer. Outside the sky had darkened, and I swore I could hear the distant howling of a wolf, that at that time, I had not yet gained the acquaintance of Walter mad, so I was not in a position to telephone him to confirm whether that was indeed what I heard. many more years passed before I decided to transfer the Petula Clark files from my desk drawer to a remote secure storage facility. The process was surprisingly straightforward, and was accomplished in a single afternoon with the assistance of Walter mad, who by this time had become my boon companion. In addition to being an animal behaviorist and an amateur electrician, he also earned a van, which he drove at terrifying speed while wearing a pair of goggles, and some sort of homemade cobbled together gutta percha breathing apparatus, having secured the Petula Clark files deep in the bowels of the storage facility, we drove back via an ice cream kiosk and stopped to eat celebrator truck ices while staring out to see I broke our contented silence by asking Walter mad if wolves are able to swim. That very much depends on the wolf and the conditions in the sea, he said. And Petula Clark, I continued, confessed when I am no expert in Petula Clark matters, he said, but I expect she can. Yes. That was precisely the answer I wanted to hear. Though I could not think for the life of me why, as I had no great interest in Petula Clark, then or now. We've digested our Cochise is Walter mad saving half of his uneaten for baiting experiments with wolves, and drove away from the kiosk as the sun sank in the West, and waves crash relentlessly against the pointy rocks.

For more years than I could count, my Petula Clark files had been by undisturbed in a remote secure storage facility, guarded by wolves. It will be a plastic tube to say that the files were gathering dust. It would also be untrue for the storage facility with a dust free one. The precise details of how this dustless state was achieved elude me, though no doubt, it had something to do with the janitors proud boast that he kept a trained swarm of dust gobbling blue bottles. It was this very same janitor who came hammering at my door One morning, waking me from uneasy dreams. I cannot recall precisely what Figment in my sleeping brain so unnerved me, though, blue bottles and Tony Blair and a bag of frozen crinkled cut oven chips were all involved. I doused these phantoms by plunging my head into a pile of ice cold water, then prompts like a ninny downstairs to answer the hammering. The janitor was gone and have the appearance of a wistful stickleback. If you find that a difficult image to visualize fact your pencil on a piece of paper and execute a sketch. Now, do you see the ostensible purpose of the janitors visit was to canvass for the Communist Party. I was not aware that there was an election in the offing, and told him so. He gave me that wistful stickleback guys see your sketch, and mattered inanities. Nevertheless, I invited him in for a cup of boiling hot tap water and a biscuit. I do not receive many visitors. So when I do I like to lavish them with such hospitality as I can muster. I also considered that an early morning conversation with a communist might help to dispel the last few vestiges of my uneasy dreams still swirling in my head. It was during the course of our discussion, when the janitor had exhausted the topics of imperialist lackeys, and cracks to production and ballet in the evenings that he made mention of my particular clock files. What he wanted to know, was my purpose in keeping them for so long, neglected and unattended. I have to admit that I had no ready answer to this question. I had no idea why I clung on to these six or seven Petula Clark files, each one a buff cardboard folder containing a single press clipping about Petula Clark, the original five or six files augmented at a slightly later date by the sixth or seventh, which held a color photograph of the Shawn ters snipped from a color supplement. I have been asked from time to time or as per another singer Cyndi Lauper time after time. While I cannot be specific about the precise number of Petula Clark files, given my also few. The truth of the matter is that I have so little interest in Petula Clark, that I have never bothered to make a tally of the items in my collection. It is for the same reason that having placed the Petula Clark files in storage are very seldom cracked out to that remote facility to consult them. Indeed, I could not remember the last time I had visited and nor could the janitor. It might be pertinent that I have yellow drawn this as has the janitor. He is also green about the gills. But I am not. The jhanas have lost patience or waiting for me a reply which did not come and he got up to leave. He excused himself by saying he had to attend the public humiliation of a bourgeois lickspittle. I think he was telling the truth, for I had noticed he was carrying a hooter in his knapsack of the sort used to amplify imprecations and insult at deafening volume at close range to the ears of Borge while lick spitals. I had once been accused of being such a lickspittle myself, and it was only by dint of pomposity and bribery by pastry delicacies that I escaped Sentra.

alone again, I felt a thinking. Usually, of course in these circumstances, I would think about wolves and their ways. But the Genesis query had turned my mind to Petula Clark, or rather to the files are kept on her and had kept through thick and thin over many decades. would I not be better off removing the files from the remote secure storage facility and consigning them to a rubbish tip? Or, if I did not want them to go to waste could burn them in my great and at least profit from a short period of welcome heat. On one of the long winter night when I shivered in my armchair wrapped in several cardigans on two different Molly hats. Yet to discard or to destroy the Petula Clark files seemed to me both somehow to be unconscionable act. I did not care very much for Petula Clark, and it was exceedingly unlikely she would ever learn of the files I kept on her. But what if she did? What if she did? I think it's fair to say she would be distraught or be only mildly though who can say and I had no wish to cause Petula Clark distress. I wish no pain upon anybody, unless it be a thief bent on breaking into the remote secure storage facility to pilfer my Petula Clark files, who will be savagely attacked the perimeter fence by my trained, if not yet electrified, moved, and richly deserved to be torn to bits by the sharpened merciless fangs. No, it seemed to me that what I ought to do, what I ought to have done years ago was to make good use of the Petula Clark files. But what use in a flash of inspiration, I realized what I needed to do, I would devise a Petula Clark project, an activity which would not only keep me occupied in the twilight of my years, but would also make full novel and innovative use of the materials in the Petula Clark files. I sprang up from my chair and cut three or four brisk capers around the room, as if I was James Boswell getting up in the morning. And then panting with exertion. I resolved to embark upon the Petula Clark project without delay. But the years have taken their toll, and my resolve was no longer than manually jack Hawkins stone George resolve of my more youthful days, when I had resolved successfully to find an efficient storage method for the Petula Clark files. I was winded from my capers, and I slumped back in my armchair, panting like a wolf. Shortly thereafter, I fell asleep. I'm happy to say I did not dream of blue bottles and Tony Blair and a bag of frozen crinkle cut oven chips. I dreamed instead of Petula Clark and the Petula Clark files, and the Petula Clark project, I would devise one side I woke at the time of writing, I am still asleep effectively, if we consider the anything other than full, bright, brilliant, the dazzling enlightened clarity of all five senses, in a blaze of utter receptivity to the gorgeous world. It's a form of sleep. But when I do wake up fully Ah, then

Perhaps the best known of the suebi and hotheads, so obscure that we do not know his name and have never known it can be seen in the bottom left corner of excuse me, of a mezzotint by the noted mezzotint is Rex tent, where he is to be seen in full suebi and hothead mode, suitably tired and we surmise, purple faced in the throes of Tempest, though the mezzotint is monochrome, yet purple we see by dint of Rex 10th artistic chops honed if his sister dot 10th memoir is to be believed, and why should it not upon Tyrolean peaks in inclement weather, with pencil and paper, and a pipe stuck in his mouth as gales held around him, scribbling furiously with the same scribbly fury he would bring, famously the lighter of gears or lighter taste depiction. So ghosts yet valiant of the Swabian hothead, in the corner of a mezzotint otherwise empty of human figures, a picture populated largely by cows and herons, or more hens, or some other birds. for it, it was often said of Rex tend not least by his sister dot tent in him in her memoir, if there was one thing the maestro could not do for love nor money, it was to draw accurately any of the birds which God created to bless the skies. If that is that was the reason for their divine intervention during the seven days of creation, or rather six on forgetting that on the seventh day he rested justice Rex tint, like to take a day off from his indefatigable mezei tinting at least once a week, usually on a Thursday, when he would prop up the bar his local clock, wealth and knock back an entire liter of abscence in homage to the habit of his hero and Ludvig Kitchener, 1880 to 1938. But so unlike the Swabian hothead, who never rested at all, never, never so hot was his head that it never allowed him to rest, at least not when he was in swaybar, I think was always in suebi. As far as we know, he never went further afield. They wouldn't let him they'd have stopped him at the border for Bittman to cross wisely it has to be said wisely, for who can get at the enormities that would ensue. If once the Swabian hothead would give an entirely fresh territory in which to be a hothead. A fair boggles the brain, mine at least, and possibly yours too, though I cannot guarantee it. Even if you've been concentrating hard and furrowing your brow and killing the end of the pencil with which I hope you've been taking notes, scribbling furiously, I read like wreck tent on top of Tara Lee and peak all those years ago, smoking his pipe swept by gales that will do for the time being.

I'm finally finally another brief life it's similar to Fred Goodwin actually Scottish banker Kaspar Hauser, German Enigma, feral child 1812 to 1833. The doctor who cared for Kaspar Hauser, was befuddled by the variety of things that caused him distress. He was unhinged by thunderstorms. The full moon brandy, loud noises quiet noises squeezed trees, bright daylight, beer, cat spiders, snakes, flowers, grape juice, beards, the color black and comedy. And that's the end for this week.
