This is resonance, while I 4.4 FM, or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is a program of Tudor songs. No, it's not. That was that was an anomaly. This is hosting yard on the air. And we're going to begin this week with a couple of a couple of excerpts from what longtime listeners will know there's my favorite book further science book 20 by Norman Davis, published in 2001 those of you who recall his book will know what to expect others I think you should just go with the flow it's a magnificent book or booklet or pamphlet. And I know I know nothing of Norman Davis but I will once again put out my call whenever I read from this book, I always ask if anyone anywhere listening has has or knows where I can get copies of books one to 19 have further signs I would be eternally grateful and would probably pay more money than I have cents anyway further signs book 20 by Norman Davis a couple of excerpts sheep wall types one that the Merino sheep is more allied to the Dale sheep than any other to the Lincoln is allied to the Lester three romney wall is a broader Dale equivalent for from n s the sequence be found off very long straight smooth white wall contrasting the far south very short straight smooth white five becoming dayle narrow find cross rippled files six becoming Midland few cross ripple Cove seven becoming broad few cross ripple Dale type full romney eight and then very short straight smooth white nine.

Obviously impugned by a peasant. It was a Thursday afternoon, and I was walking along a lane between Aspen's and marches. I saw the peasant up ahead, he was leaning against the style, and as I got closer, I saw he was idly swinging a flail to no great purpose. As I passed him, he impugned me in some sort of rustic invective I barely understood. I would have dashed him to the ground with a single blow. But alas, I'm a milk soft and a weakling, and I merely passed on by along the line, blushing and furious. Later, as I sat in the countryside canteen, drinking a tumbler of sculpture, I reflected upon this peasant and his impugning. What was he doing leaning against that style? Why was he swinging a flail? In what brutish are got did he speak? Much to my disgust, I realized I was obsessed by him. As in death in Venice, Gustav Ron ashen back is obsessed by tadeo or in love and death on Long Island. Giles das is obsessed by Ronnie Bostock. But tadeo and Ronnie are young and beautiful. Whereas my peasant, my peasant was old and snaggletooth and filthy and wretched. My hands were shaking, and I swapped some of my sculpture on the canteen table, drowning a fly. As I returned along the lane, I adjusted the Corvette around my neck to give it a more rakish look, and I primped my Buffon and I turned my truck into a sort of flouncing prompts. As I neared the bend in the lane beyond which the style would come into view. My heart began to thump violently, and my mouth became so dry. I gasped. Would my peasant still be there? Would he impugn me again? I wanted to run back to the safety of the canteen, but at the same time, I was desperate to see him once more. So filthy, so rustic, so ancient, so vile. How can I express the sickening sensation I felt as I rounded the bend and saw that my peasant was gone? It was as if a lot of vipers rise within my guts. Sunlight dappled through the Aspen's and the larches a breeze refresh the air, and there was the style, but leaning on it now were two impossibly attractive youngsters playing conquers closing in on them panting like a monster of depravity. I saw a war name badges. One was tadeo the other Ronnie I was barely coherent as I babble that them asking if they'd seen a peasant, an old filthy snaggletooth peasant with a flail, have I seen in which direction he had gone? And when? And was he going fast or slow, with purpose or without and did the sunlight glisten on his greasy matted hair? First tadeo, then Ronnie impugned me, in particular they impugned my cravat and my boufal and my flouncing, I crumpled to the ground, weeping and neurasthenic. I would have welcomed death there and then, but of course, I did not die. an hour or two later, I got to my feet and dusted the muck of the lane from my Italianate seat. The sun was sinking in the West, and tadeo and Ronnie were long gone. I picked up a pebble tracted in expertly at a linnet perched in an Aspen. I missed the bird of course, and I pranced away from the style and made my way home.

Years later, looking back on that afternoon, I can no longer picture the name tag the youth, but the vision of the peasant. Is it clear to me as if he was sat here oppositely I do not have him of course, but I have his simulacrum, posed in the armchair built out of cardboard and wire and wall with piano keys for his teeth, and a light dusting of authentic countryside muck. And when I activate the console, he impugns me in that mechanical guttural rustic invective. I had a character actor record for me, and which still still, I barely understand.

Before going on, I just like to make a quick announcement. The library paste is on a shelf in the gazebo and of announcement, the callin pins Excuse me. The Cowan pins was a singularly squalid tavern, much frequented by humans scum. Once long ago, it had been a coaching in but the construction of an efficient canal system destroyed the coach trade and bar G's passing by a board there barges upon the canal. Were a salubrious malt, who drank tea from flasks and read improving literature. The cow and pins stood crumbling and fell on on the line parallel to the towpath of the canal. And soon only the crumbling and full on the indigent and misbegotten. The violent and the psychopathic ever set foot upon it rotten sawdust covered floor.

One psychopath who became a tavern regular the ferocious bubinski took over as the landlord after cropping up the existing incumbent with an axe and feeding him to the pigs. The pigs who lived happily in a pig style a little way down the lane from the tavern did not of course know there's well that day contained the ground up remains of their power from the cow and pins, who used to commune with them in a hearty Manta pig way whenever he got the chance. With bubinski at the helm, things changed, but Pinsky hated pigs. And after that first feeding, he shunned the sty. Some said in fear that the specter of the man he had chopped up and then ground up and then stirred in with the pigs will lay in white fame there to wreak revenge from the realm of death. It is more likely, however, that the Pinsky was too busy being mad and bad and dangerous. In the tavern, where he now held sway. He tore down the walls from the he tore down from the walls the showbiz memorabilia that most recently adorn them, gone with a photographs of the previous landlord, arm in arm with Rolf Harris and van and found dunican and Edith Sitwell gone where the autograph portrayed of Ken Homme and Tammy we met, gone where the posters advertising pentos with Keith Clegg winners buttons and George Galloway as pol pot. in their place babinski pinned up his weird handwritten screed pages and pages ripped from the exercise books, which we filled with gibberish. Out wet the barrels of ale and the bottles of champagne and liquors and rare expensive brandies out wet the soft drinks and the mineral waters. And then their place was installed the single vast trough into which was poured and out of which was the ladle into dented tin beakers disgusting build made of God knows what Taste was foul, but it was cheap, and just a beaker full or to suffice to ravage the drinkers brain to zombie them. babinski himself allowed no other fluid into his body, which probably accounted for what one might charitably called his eccentricities. Under his predecessor, there had been a jukebox in the cow and pins well stocked with the gems of prog rock. But then he smashed it up with his axe and sharpened the edges of the discs inside, so he could use them as missiles, slicing through the air to hit and sever a juggler or other important vein through which the blood relentlessly pumps then he dug a deep, deep pit and fed wires down it. Why is that the end of which were microphones that picked up the constant agonized howling and screaming of sinners being tormented for eternity in the pits of hell. Amplified a blaring ear splitting volume from speakers placed all around the tavern. It was a rough and raucous place perilous for the weedy toper, who might once have sat in the snug watching coaches rattled by the Snuggie itself had been demolished by bubinski. And the space occupied was now at Carlisle ground, stacked with the bleak bones of those he slew when he was in the mood for slaying which was most days. Sometimes the villain would power volts across the canal, like Spring Heeled jack for the sole purpose of setting upon a poor innocent, orphaned or crippled, plucking flowers for a nose guy from the canal side shrub beds. But Ben ski carried out his killings with impunity for a type of amnesia stalk their land, and even the police officers blunder the bout in a hypnogogic state. But one law that was rigorously enforced in this land of efficient canals was that which regulated the licensing hours of taverns even bubinski Yes, bubinski himself was terrified of the tavern time trio, three brought to patrolled on horseback to ensure that every Tavern was locked and bolted dark and silent. As the clocks struck the witching hour.

Their horses were as brutish as the trio themselves. Gigantic, fierce beast with repulsive fetlocks and mains matted with MK, whose Marist Willie was 1000 times more hideous than the infernal muzak of the cow and pins. Freeman Hardy and Willis the horses were called, but nobody knew the names of their riders, for nobody ever dared to ask. Just as no taverner ever dared to wrecked his Tavern stay open for one second past closing time. Nobody could even remember when the law had been broken, so that nobody knew what punishment would be meted out by the tavern time trio. The sheer size of the horses of their ranks stink and the thunder of their hooves is like galloped from tavern, tavern, and the brutishness of the trio themselves in their gold LeMay tuxedos and Snow White's bats, and the piercing whistles they blew. As they rode, and the official documents poking out of their pockets, these things were enough to count each and every Tavern keeper babinski included. Some it was that in spite of the clamor and uproar of the cow and pins, easily the most exciting part of the day was chucking out time. Human scum, their brains and bodies jangled by whatever it was they'd been gulping down from babinski trough would be startled by the sudden cessation of the Amplified agonies of the nether world that is assailed instead by bubinski hooter. Those of you familiar with this contractual contraption, roll know that it was the most powerful hooter that ever existed on Earth, or on any other planet in any other universe. hooter par excellence, the ne Plus Ultra of Hooters, the lack of which we shall never hear again, for which in truth, we should be thankful. babinski puppet is who to adjust once to signal that The cow and pins was closing for the night. And once was all it was needed to imagine hearing that hooter who twice in succession is more than the mind can bear. Whether the mind is sane and sober, or blasted to fuddle meant by dented 10 beaker folds of disgusting bilge. Not that the sane or the sober would be found among the human wreckage, who herring the hooter drained the last drops of build from their beakers, and tossed the beakers into the trough. Then out of the tavern, they tumbled a jumble of chaos, many of them toppling into the canal, others falling and lying flat on their backs where they fell in the mud, where they would remain insensible until the cow and pins opened its doors the next morning. And inside the tavern babinski, who never slept, filled with bilge, all the beakers that had been tossed into the trough, and run them up on the counter. He put on his super loud bang and bang, bang, bang, bang, bang quadrophonic headphones, and switch to subterranean microphones back on. As he listened to the shrieks of the sinful, he worked his way through the line of beakers, one after another. And when he was done, he wrote one of his weird screeds and pinned it to the wall, and then he lumbered out into the dead of night in search of something to slaughter. The cow on pins was of course, Dobson's preferred tavern, but by the time the out of print pamphleteer came to patronize it bubinski was long dead, and it was once again the kind of place where we de Toba could sit in the snog and scribble a pamphlet. Now the Dobson was weedy exactly, he occasionally got into fights and acquitted himself with a plum. As for bubinski hooter, when the new landlord took over the tavern, he had it dismantled by specialists from a hooter dismantling Squadron.

to be on the safe side, they buried the parts separately in deep red lined wells, unmarked and scattered across six continents. foolishly though, the captain of the squadron made a map, pinpointing the locations to keep as a souvenir. And last week, it was reported in the daily hooter that the map had been stolen. Yes, friends, it is a horrible possibility that even now somewhere out there, a madcap creamiest is hard at work, putting babinski hooter back in one piece. You may well say, I know I did.

And finally, this week, some more extracts from Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives. This is a book published by constable coming out two weeks today. So go to your local bookshop on the first of October to buy a copy, or pre order it on an online book retailer. And yes, it's a collection of shorter potted biographies of various people. And last week, I read you some of people beginning with the letter A, and this week in what brief time we have left. I'll read you some of people beginning with be Robert Baden Powell. English Scoutmaster. 1857, to 1941 Biden pals favorite method of crossing the road was the stride forth, looking to neither left nor right. Sure, in those conviction that the foot smoker had as much right to the kingshighway as any motorist, if as a result, he gets it in the back. He dies asserting his right, that is not blank foolishness. That's British. Hardy or Baynes, Indian Marxist Leninist revolutionary 1939 to 1997. In the 1970s, having decided that mark Maoism was an imperialist reactionary deviation, and that Albania was the only true socialist state, hobby or bane. Baines turned his hand to writing song lyrics. We think for the future, for example, begins in utter chaos the old order spews out unlimited decadence and parasitism. It brings disaster to mankind, and fights against progress with unprecedented ferocity stricken by all kinds of sickness, this systems in all tied in crisis with economics at the base, spiritual and cultural devastation. The crisis is social and political to these and other words were set to jaunty tunes by Cornelius cardroom. Car drew himself provided the lyrics, phase 1971 piece 10,000 nails in the coffin of imperialism for voice hammer, nails and blocks of wood. Some of you may remember that pansy cradle jus and I think did a performance of 10,000 nails in the coffin of imperialism on this very show, some while back, and yes, at a time when Jeremy Corbyn is in charge of the Labour Party, that might be a good time to revive it. Onwards john Logie bed, Scottish inventor 1898 to 1946. Before inventing the television, bear tried his hand at his own varieties of jam, honey and soap, and Payton's sock. The first television was a makeshift Heath Robinson affair, mounted on a washstand the base of the motor was a T test. The projection lamp was housed in a biscuit tin, scanning disc to a cut from cardboard, and the rest of the apparatus consisted of four ponycycle lenses, scrap wood, darning needles, sealing wax, and string. And finally this week, Julia balcom I fictional character from 1857. Julia balcom was one of the most memorable characters of 19th century fiction. She appeared in wizard leaves from memories garland by Abigail Stanley Hannah, from which I quote next to Rosa Whittier sat Julia balcom with saddened expression of countenance and large, deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper expression of melancholy and made glances than is usual to the Mary age of childhood, and elicited your sympathy. Err, you knew her history. Julia was a cripple. She was drawn to school by an older sister with rosy cheeks, bright, flashing black eyes, at a sprightly animated countenance,

and carried into the school room in the arms of her teacher, or one of the oldest scholars. And so she came year after year, mingling with the Mary group. But where is she now? Yon little mound of heap top Earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can but hope she has denied the privilege of walking on Earth, may now saw on Angel's wings. This dear child, was obliged to crawl from place to place after her more favored companions, dragging her useless perished ruins behind her. But he who cares for us knew what was best for her, and we cannot doubt his infinite wisdom. Well, I hope that brought a tear to your eye, or floods of tears. It certainly did to mine. You can't hear my sobbing but that's because of the magic of live radio. I will be back next week. I'll read you might redo some more shorter potty brief, brief lives. Perhaps those beginning with the letter C. I'll read you some more pros and I might even read you some further science.
