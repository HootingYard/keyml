Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air for the hundreds or thousands of listeners concerned about my health. I still seem to have a bit of a cold as last week. So if you hear me coughing and spluttering, send me the notes have sympathy. And last week we there was I read a piece about angles of hats, and today I want to turn my attention to angels of hearts. One of the least rewarding periods of blogilates life was when he had a job managing a collection of huts, each of which has its residence had its resident Angel. These were battered and dilapidated rustic huts, rather than rather than more well appointed beach huts or chalets, the type of hot Blodgett understood them to be when he accepted the post. Imagine his distress when the train taking him to his new office delivered him not to a sandy stretch of coastline, but to worth filthy countryside backwater, ankle deep in muck. This was particularly galling because at the time he was being followed about by film crew working on a documentary called Blodgett on the beach. The film had been commissioned by an ambitious but airheaded young get from Channel build, and once it became clear that Blodgett was not going anywhere near the seaside, the air had canceled the project and sent his crew to cover a dramatic reconstruction of the credit crunch instead. So it was a solitary Blodgett who was deposited from the train at a deserted railway station in the middle of nowhere. He fumbled in his pocket for the hand scrawled map his masters had given him and set off on his squelchy way to a distant barn, in a corner of which a desk with an anglepoise lamp and a pencil sharpener and a vase of spurge had been provided as his operational base. Just as the United Nations has its special rapporteurs and Olympic teams have their shift the mission. Blodgett job title was French and sounded important, and he was at least at this point in his life, naive enough to swell with pride as approaching the barn. He paused pin his badge on his lapel. To their credit, his employers have no truck with such Execration as the contemporary laminated name, badge. And Blodgett badge was brass and heraldic and lively with bicton talent and winged beasts of Miss, and with Latin inscriptions. Blodgett had neither French nor Latin, so he had no idea of the meaning of either his job title or of the motto upon his badge. What he did have were unparalleled map breeding skills, and he was soon installed at his desk in the corner of the barn, having improvised a crate as a chair and plugged the anglepoise lamp into a generator. So many hats for which Blodgett had responsibility was scattered all over the place in no discernible pattern. This rapidly became apparent to him when he stuck pins into a map tacked up on the bond wall, each pin representing one of the hearts. Blodgett did this with much enthusiasm as preparation for what he foresaw as regular rounds of visits to his hats until their resident angels. So great was the distance he would have to travel that he wondered if he could afford to rent a horse or a jalopy. He was counting out his coinage on the desk just hours after his arrival, when he was interrupted by a visitor, who brought news that blasted Blodgett plans and left him sobbing. How now shouted the new camera as he burst into the barn, you must be Blodgett I am Simon seabag constanza and this is my thing, Troon. He pulled a portable poppo phone from his pocket to press the knob and a short burst of Hindemith's concept music for string and brass instruments office 50 1930 roared deafening volume and made the band shake. It also made Blodgett shake so much so that he lost his footing and toppled to the floor, where he remained hidden from his visitors view as constanza continued having read depressed the norburn popped the poppo phone back into his pocket.

There is much you will need to know is the new marriage The many scattered huts Blodget with their resident angels. And I'm here to tell you what's what, even though you're crumbled on the floor behind your desk. It's all the same to me if you stay there throughout your tenure, so long as you keep up with your paperwork. I will be out and about on my visits to the huts for I am the milk man. No, no, not the sort of milkman you may think pootling around the lanes in an electric float delivering bottles of milk, as happened in days of yore. A pox on such ninnies. No, I am the milkman who calls upon the angels of the hearts and monitors their intake of angel milk. There are recording angels and fumigating angels, there are angels of mercy, moon, angels and archangels. But what all angels have in common is that they are reliant upon Angel milk for the sprightliness and spark. Thus it falls to me to keep a proper check on the angels of our hearts, lest they fall prey to onwy and velge Schmitz through neglecting their milk diet. Your job Meanwhile, is to sit at your desk or crumpled on the floor behind it. And by the light of the anglepoise lamp to enter my daily dictated reports into a ledger. We measure milk by the pint here budget, so you will need no knowledge of fractions. But you must tally up the daily percentage and do much other tiresome and exhausting drudgery and never once set foot outside the barn, not even to contemplate the cows in the field, or to chuck breadcrumbs onto the duck pond. For at any time of day or night. I the milkman may come a calling with my reports, and you must be at your post diligent and miserable for such as the way we do things in these parts. And if ever you forget that you will be at the mercy of the caco demons Blodgett that kakko demons with their curdled milk and their unspeakable yogurts. With a second blast of his theme tune from the pop iPhone, Simon seabag costanza, the milk man swept out of the barn. From behind the desk came the sound of sobbing, as Blodgett realized the full horror of his situation. He was stuck with it for years for years and years, at a desk in the corner of the barn in the middle of nowhere, when all he had ever wanted was to stride purposely from hut to hut huts he was in charge of preferably at the seaside.

Vargas the mustachioed Mexican cop played by Charlton Heston in Orson Welles his classic Touch of Evil 1958 had a walk on part in one of the more curious episodes of Dobson's life. Mystery surrounds the sudden appearance in Mexico of the out of print pamphleteer. Although the oft repeated stories that he holds interview on the very spot were a few seconds earlier, Ambrose bierce had vanished, never to be seen again, can be discounted on the basis that it is chronologically incoherent. What makes the idea of Dobson in Mexico so perplexing is that he was notoriously unsuited to hot temperatures, like Horace Walpole, he often had a bucket of ice close to hand, though not of course, when he was in Mexico, for in the high noon of a sweltering day, such as the one when he made his inexplicable appearance in that hot gland. Such a bucketful would have melted away within seconds. as one might expect, Dobson was dressed in appropriately. Witnesses record that he was in wrapped in a firm muffler and some sort of reindeer hide Cagoule, his large, ungainly feet slotted into a pair of padded boots as worn by our pianists. It would be helpful I think, to have a goodly supply of words in Spanish to deploy when setting the scene. Last that language is not among my accomplishments, nor are most of the languages spoken and written in the world. So you'll just have to picture the pamphlet here, tottering unsteadily down a dusty road in a Mexican village. No one knew where he had come from, how he had got there, nor what the ramifications of his presence would be. And you can bet there would be ramifications there. Always With Dobson, he was not to be blunt the sort of pamphleteer who could shrink into the shadows like a discarded and overlooked violet. If he did not always make a lot of noise, he somehow seemed to things would crash around him, or he would disturb the kinds of animals that Howland screech such as dogs and wolves and scrape trails and monkeys, or he would set off clanging alarm bells. At least such rackets occurred on his foreign trips for when he was at home in his dismal backwater silence could sometimes rain for days on end, broken only by the endless thrumming of rain upon the roof. There was no rain here in Mexico, not today, just a broiling and battering sun in a sky innocent of clouds. beneath it, tottered Dobson, a pencil in one hand and a notebook in the other. had anyone dared ask him what he was bent upon doing, he would have explained that he was engaged in what you'd like to call pamphleteering in the field. By this he didn't mean the sort of field he was used to at home with its cows and Rusty farm equipment, but the abstract field, beloved of anthropologists and ethnographers, and indeed all sorts of persons who charge about the place imagining that they're grappling with the authentic. Dobson did not care to pins about authenticity, delusional or otherwise. But he fancied himself as the kind of pamphleteer who could ring a pamphlet from whatever circumstances he found himself in, and once he hit upon the pamphleteering in the field phrase, he made a meal of it. Thus, in the year of which I write, he had been stumbling aimlessly from one place to another penciling pamphlets as he went. Now in Mexico, as he slumped against an Adobe horse related street appurtenance lit one of his crumpled cigarettes. He wrote in his notebook, pamphlet in the field number 10. I appeared to be in a Mexican village, there will be ramifications, but as yet I do not know what they will be. It was at this point that Rahman Miguel Mike Vargas came upon the scene. He was off duty from his top job in the Mexican Narcotics Bureau, but his presence in the small dusty village has never been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps like Dobson, he was just there for no real purpose. History is full of such apparently meaningless conjunctions. Consider that Stalin and Trotsky first met each other in what is now a McDonald's restaurant on white chapel road in East London,

or that Richard Milhouse Nixon left Dallas from Love Field man hours before john F. Kennedy flew in on that fateful November morning in 1963. Can the encounter of Dobson and Vargas be said to have the same resonance? Certainly what passed between them seemed unimportant at the time, remembering that he had to buy some fruit pastilles for his wife Susie, and wishing to jot down a note, Vargas asked to borrow Dobson's pencil. The pamphleteer obliged, mindful of the quiet authority of the Mexican law man, but as he handed over the pencil, he managed in that dobb Sony and way of his to frighten some hens who were coming to eat some grain that had been scattered near the Adobe hawks related street appurtenance if you've ever seen a gaggle of panicked hands fleeing from a pencil brandishing pamphleteer, you will know quite well what chaos can be wrought in a dusty village. There was uproar and shouting and the clattering of many cooking pots and semi automatic gunfire. By the time things settled down a few minutes later, after the village hen person wove his Henley spell over the hens duplicate them. Vargas had forgotten all about Susie's fruit pastilles, a Dobson had quite lost his train of thought. Both men might have forgotten the entire incident, but their lives were changed forever. It is not clear precisely what happened when Vargas returns to his motel room fruit pastoralists, and it would be foolish to speculate. We know however, that Dobson underwent a numerous scenic miasma when he found he was incapable, incapable of completing pamphlets in the field number 10. By nightfall, he had left the Mexican village as suddenly as Ambrose bierce had vanished. Indeed, he had left Mexico altogether and was aboard a packet steamer bound eventually for home. He spent the entire voyage and the connecting voyages on any number of other seagoing vessels huddled in his cabins sucking on vitamin tablets, and mopping his brow with wrung out dish cloth. his notebook remained unopened, unwritten in, partly due to the numerous scenic miasma, and partly because in all the mayhem of the panicking hens incident, vog acid popped Dobson's pencil into his pocket, and he had neglected to return it. The pamphleteer fetched up at home months later, still wearing his firm muffler and reindeer hide cuckooland padded Alpine boots. The rain was thrumming on the roof, and marigold Chu was fixing a tarpaulin over the guttering. she greeted Dobson brightly. Hello Dobson. How is the field? I am done with the field he muttered. It has broken me. From now on I shall write all my pamphlets sitting at my desk, or a pot of pencils and a pencil sharpener in easy reach. And without another word, he went and sat at the famed esquerra tois and began to write the pamphlet we know today as the unanswerable chaos caused by panicking hands out of print. As you probably recall, he dedicated it to Ramon Miguel Mike Vargas.

Recently on the hooting yard website I posted a picture which was an emotionally wrenching yet compellingly vapid scene from prudence foxgloves 1894 play, oh, Lord, let us give vent to the charitable impulse by offering pies to sordid little ragamuffins. long forgotten. This knockabout tragic comic melodrama has been revived by the bulges spinny emotionally wrenching theatre troupe, currently performing a 16 hour version on the parrot pointy town. Anyway, often mentioning prudence foxglove, I was deluged with post from readers of the website avid for more information about her. I'm currently working on a biography of the unsung Victorian genius, which vote potted will also be magisterial. Meanwhile, I've managed to dig out an excerpt from her play, may the light of our Savior being down upon the cripples and paupers of every parish in the land 1894. So I would like to read that to you. Now I'm going to have to do all the parts but I'm sure you'll get the idea. Seen a filthy hovel, steeped in gloom, drunken Brut, go and get my bludgeon so I can bludgeon you about the head and a fit of intoxicated rage. June lommy, Governor, you're as frightening a brute as ever bludgeoned a poor half blind urchin about the head. drunken brute? Yes, I am. And if you don't get my blood in this instance, I'll box your ears as well. You chin you chin. Oh, did ever a poor half blind Earth can lead so squalid and unchristian a life as I am fated to do since my parents perished in an early railway accident, and I was abducted from kindly old Mark dropsies idyllic cottage for pallid infants by the drunken Brut urchin exits to fetch drunken brutes bludgeon. drunken brood does some comic business with a birdcage and a set of napkins and urging, holding a prayer book. crunk and brute what now Ergin that looks to me suspiciously like a prayer book urging is a prayer book drunken brute while I was stumbling half blind about the other part of the filthy hovel, trying to find your bludgeon a proper posh lady dressed all in finery came and handed it to me suggesting that I read some prayers to you. drunken brute Geiger have a good mind to give you a double boxing of the ears. urchin? Yes, that is quite understandable given that you are a drunken brute. But perhaps the lady was right and if I read Do some prayers you will be engulfed in the light of our Savior and no longer be drunken and brutish, but a reformed character of sober mean and a determination to devote your life to hard work and social advancement. kin begins to write recite prayer, drunken Brutus seized by pangs of remorse and self loathing and collapses into his chair into prudence foxglove prudence foxglove My name is prudence foxglove, and I am the proper posh lady who pounced upon this half blind urge in in the other part of the filthy hovel, and see what wonders I have wrought by bringing the word of our Savior into this benighted hellhole. Note to the daring modernism of my play, where is the authorized barge into the action and address you the audience directly? We shall leave the earth in and the drunken brute bit dazzled by the Lord's light, and in Acts two, we shall cast our eyes upon another scene of moral depravity and high debauch The scene is another filthy a hovel, where smallpox scarred Match Girl is at the mercy of a different drunken brute. Until by chance, they hear a thunderous sermon from an Oxford educated preacher, a man of Stern, Protestant rectitude, and their lives are forever transformed.

I think we've got time now for two pieces of advice about two different things. We may only have time for one, we'll see how we get on. The best thing to do in certain circumstances is to lie on your side upon the grass in a meadow and have an acolyte pour vinegar into your ear through a funnel. When you stand up in the middle of the meadow and tilt your head shaking it a little, the vinegar will be expelled from your ear, and you will feel the benefits. It is important that you have an acolyte who can properly adjudge the amount of vinegar to pour into your ear, too little in the whole exercise is pointless, too much and you'll be tilting your head and shaking it until the cows come home and you'll find it very difficult to expel all the vinegar. When the cows come home, they may be disconcerted to find you in a meadow with your tilted head and some of them may become fractures, fractures, cows can be dangerous, so it will help if you have your acolyte armed with some sort of cow protection device. This might be made out of corrugated cardboard or alternatively, if tin foil best to consult a catalogue of cow protection devices beforehand with your acolyte at your side. Choosing an acolyte to whom you're prepared to entrust the pouring and the cow protection is a fraught business but leave you me. It is a process during which you can expect much heightened emotion many tears, a certain amount of wailing and now and then fencing contests with flashing a page. It's it has even been known for rival acolytes to bash each other about with spades, so it's advisable not to give them access to the keys to the potting shed. You will probably have at least one set of duplicate potting shed keys hanging from a hook in the pantry. So make sure you keep the pantry out of bounds to acolytes say for those who need to enter it to fetch tins of tinned plums and tin radishes and other tinned goods. It's a simple matter to give but one acolyte, the responsibility for the factoring of tins, and that acolyte can be disqualified from even the possibility of pouring vinegar into your ear in the middle of the cow Meadow while you lie on your side by having him blinded or having his legs broken and confining him to the house. Another thing to bear in mind when choosing the appropriate acolytes is that they must be able to get you from the house to the middle of the meadow with the minimum of fast, fast is corrosive of the soul and has been known to result in horrible bodily eruptions such as sores and boils and separating patches of past in such tender places as the groin in the armpits, you will want to level headed and charming acolyte. One who confronted by menacing geese on the way from the house to the meadow will sue them by singing something by Kevin Coyne in a deeply lovely voice, Gita usually located in this way, even the most ferocious ones. You will probably want to be carried from the house to the meadow on a Palin keen given your preening self regard. You will thus require additional acolytes to do the carrying one of whom can also be the vinegar pouring acolyte if you so wish. It's therefore a very good idea to have some distractions at hand to entertain those who wants their carrying is done have not to do until you command them to carry you back to the house. When you flush the vinegar out of your ear. Most acolytes can be happy by board games, poopy the Kronstadt rebellion and waiting around in a meadow while vinegar is poured into the ear of your hero are splendid and complicated games using dice counters and the feathers of placated geese. But of course, there are many other games board based on otherwise, which you may consider packing in your puppy bag when making preparations to be carried from the house to the meadow. If you have acolytes who are resistant to the allure of exciting board games, it's probably best to dismiss them with their tails between their legs. As the saying goes. The dismissal of acolytes can be problematic, particularly if they're clinging, clinging, acolytes are known to use gum to a fix themselves to fixtures and fittings such as the doors of your pantries and the railings bordering manses. Be on your guard against them. rifle fire tends to deter all but the cleanest who may have to be detached from their gummy emplacements with gum dissolving fluids in spray canisters.

Frank Key  26:49
When making a purchase of these canisters, you may be asked to fill out a form declaring that they will not be used to dissolve the gamma fixing and acolyte to the railings of your man's in these circumstances, just lie you will go to hell. But would you rather not being held and be subject to the forming of a gummed acolyte? And I think we just have time for a second piece of advice. I'll probably need to read this fairly quickly. Sooner or later, most owners of venomous serpents will wish to defang their cold blooded pets. neighborhood watch gas lighters and local busy bodies often make life difficult for the venomous serpent owner, particularly when the paths and lanes in the vicinity are littered with the bodies of poisoned innocence with telltale puncture marks and faces frozen in characters of twisted Torah. You have to weigh up the pleasure of having a happy serpent giving full vent to its instinctual drive to sink it fangs into the flesh of a passing greengrocer, and the opprobrium which is an almost inevitable result, social death and want of invitations to elegant drawing room soirees, regrettably, the lot of the venomous serpent owner as if somehow it's the keeper, rather than the pet, who has been slithering about dropping unexpectedly from the branches of trees and injecting lethal toxins into everybody from the postmistress to the community hub outreach worker. It should be noted that I'm referring to singularly aggressive venomous serpents those which attack without provocation due to there being agents of Beelzebub comes the time eventually, when one tires of black looks for a month fellows in the bus queue and have always been served last in the butcher shop. It is at this point that the venomous serpent owner concedes that the only solution is to defang their pet. Doing so is not without its risks, especially if the venomous serpent gets an inkling of what is afoot and decides to strike first, the obituary columns of A village newspaper, a trucker with the names of rash wannabe de fangers, whose venomous serpents turned on them. Particularly quick thinking venomous serpents have been known to plunge their fangs into the neck of their owner as a pre emptive measure, before the owner has even resolved to go down the de Fang route.

The I, I think we have to come to the end of the show, and I'm halfway through that. So what I'll do is I'll read the whole thing next week. That will be exciting for you. Sorry about that. But things happen, you know, and that's the beauty of a live show. So I'll be back next week. Thank you for listening. Bye
