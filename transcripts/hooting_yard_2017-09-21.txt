4.4 m on the FM audit cut out rather harsh, isn't it? On the FM on the DA B's in a London and a brush and resonance extra. And also online dub dub dub dot resonance if m.com we've got the ever faithful Frank key Up next, but at 630 Britney Spears is in the house, spears energy, youthful, ever youthful chap playing some tunes. So we'll be seeing him at 630 to 730. First it is.

Frank Key  01:03
Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four f n resonance fm.com if you're listening on your computer, and this is hooting yard on the air, my name is Frank key. The first story I'm going to read to you this week was written about a year ago for an American podcast called the drabblecast, which apparently has nothing to do with Margaret drabble or her sister as Biet. And I wrote the story for the drabblecast and sent it off. And they wrote back and asked me to record some of the voices. And one of the other voices in the in the pace was, was done by Ed Baxter. The What is his title? benevolent dictator of resonance, FM, and it vanished, and the podcast every now and then I check and the podcast hasn't been updated since January. And all attempts to contact them have failed. And so I don't really know what, if any, if any listeners know what's happened to the drabblecast, I'd be very pleased to find out. It's a train because it was good. And I was looking forward to hearing this story read by Norman Sherman, who is a fine narrator. But months and months and months have gone by so I thought, well, I'm gonna read the piece here. I'll have to do all the voices. But anyway, here it is. It's called Mr. Key goes to ins mouth. And some of you many of you will, will soon work out which writer inspired it. I write these words with immense difficulty and in frantic haste. If what I believe is true, I have a little more than an hour perhaps to before my mind will lose its moorings, the brain inside my head will be reduced to a twitching jelly of me as MC hora and I will be a hopeless case, raving and gibbering and throwing myself against the walls of this padded cell. I am confined here. Upon my own insistence. I have to demand that the lunatic asylum staff lock me up and keep me locked up. If in an hour or twos time, I was free to roam the streets among other men. I shudder to think what unimaginable chaos and havoc would be wrought. No, I must remain here isolated from a world that must must be protected at all cost from me, or rather from the thing that I will soon become. Connected really be only a week ago that I was sitting at home surrounded by my familiar magnets and retorts and cylinders in peace and comfort without a care in the world. Other than the incessant yapping of my neighbor's dog, and the incessant tinkling of the bell dangling from the collar around my neighbor's dog's neck and the incessant, you relating incantations of my neighbor himself. incantations devised to summon forth the incarnation of the hideous back God fatso. incantations, which sank to the heavens had proved unsuccessful for 20 years, and which one hoped would remain unsuccessful for a further 20 years, and indeed forever after the yapping and the tinkling and the Yuliya lighting aside, I was, as I say, in peace and comfort, and could never have imagined the inexplicable horror that was about to unfold. It has been just one week, but I feel I have lived through 1000 years, nay. 1000 centuries 1000 millenia in that time.

Frank Key  05:31
It all began prosaically enough with the telltale sound of the daily postal delivery dropping onto the mat. I put aside the lemon meringue pie I was eating and went to retrieve it. I select briefly through the items, a couple of bills, a letter from my bankers, the latest copy of the Reader's Digest, I quickly scanned the contents page and made a mental note to read at the earliest opportunity, the article about bringing a monkey out of a medically induced coma. And there were a couple of advertising flyers and faithfully as I was to learn a black envelope addressed by hand in gleaming silver lettering, bearing a postage stamp, which, though I looked at it from every conceivable angle, and then from several inconceivable angles, resisted all attempts to see it clearly. It seemed somehow to shift in shape and color and size to become invisible and then visible again. I could not even tell whether it was self adhesive or had had to be affixed to the envelope with a lick of spittle from a human or in human tongue. Placing the rest of the post in my wicker basket on my escrow tois I returned to the breakfast table, took another mouthful of lemon meringue pie and opened the envelope carefully. The letter inside was unexpectedly ordinary, a single sheet of white paper covered in black handwriting of commendable neatness and legibility. Dear Mr. Key I read, I have long been an admirer of your hooting yard website and the associated podcasts on resonance FM. It is an enthusiasm fully shared by my colleagues in the Faculty of blasphemous and forbidden studies at miskatonic. University arcam. From where I write this letter. To be wholly accurate, I should say that I'm writing from the campus annex in ins mouth where the faculty offices are based, such as our admiration for you that we wish to issue an invitation. There is work that needs to be done important and urgent work, and we think you have a man to do it. It is a somewhat delicate matter. And I'm reluctant to put the details down in writing and not merely reluctant let us say rather, that the prospect of committing those details to pen and paper fills me with a terrible nameless dread. For this reason, I would be grateful if at your earliest convenience, you would telephone me on the number given below. The telephone number followed and the letter was signed in a Florida shaky hand by Professor Charles Dexter Nyala, fo tab, Dean of Faculty, I immediately picked up my telephone receiver and dialed after a few rings, there was a click as if my call had been answered, but no one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up when my ear caught a faint suspicion of sound. With someone trying under great difficulties to talk. As I listened. I thought I heard a sort of half liquid bubbling noise, glob glob glob, which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called is that Professor Nyala? hotep, but the only answer was glob glob, glob glob, then my interlocutor, whoever it was, whatever it was hung up. If there is one thing I learned from President Nixon, it was the advisability of tape recording all my conversations. A second thing I learned from him was relief stress by mashing potatoes, but that was not pertinent to the current situation. I plucked the cassette from the machine and hurried next door. I did not go to my you relating neighbor with the yapping dog and the yapping dogs tinkling bells But to my neighbor on the other side, this fellow happened to be an eminent and distinguished retired professor of comparative and applied Exeo linguistics, and I was certain he would be able to help me to understand the strange sounds from the telephone call. Sure enough, having played the tape back to him, my neighbor was able to make an instant translation.

Frank Key  10:27
I have communed with many fish and other aquatic beings, he said, and I recognize this at once as the lingua franca of a particularly hideous and unimaginably horrible spawn of the chronic depth of the sea. depths so deep that all life is blotted out, and the creatures there a grotesque blind our be no monsters with riving flippers. One must listen intently to each glob to discern its meaning. In this case, it seems you are being invited to miskatonic University for the purpose of writing the Authorized Biography of the Mad Arab Abdul alhazred, author of the Necronomicon I thank the professor gave him the remainder of my lemon meringue pie, returned home practice suitcase and made my way to the railway station where I caught the next train to Arkham at Arkham I would need to change trains to proceed on the branch line to the university campus and exit ins mouth. It was a long journey, and I pass the time by reading my Xerox copy of Eben Cali Khan's early 12th century biography of Abdul alhazred. This was the text that claimed, among other things, that the Mad Arab had been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright frozen witnesses. I did not believe a word of this nor have much else in the book. And as the train pass through boschi rustic backwaters, I grew confident that as the authorized biographer appointed by miskatonic University, I could do a far better job. When eventually we arrived at ns mouth, I booked myself into a dilapidated and Ill starred boarding house by the key side. The landlady was a swarthy, bloated dwarf of cretinous appearance, I suspected she was the product of centuries of inbreeding. When completing the register, she asked me in her weirdly, strangulated guttural cat a wall of a voice punctuated by almost reptilian hisses to state the nature of my business. Rather than trusting her with the truth, I claimed to be an aide de camp to President Nixon scouting possible locations for a branch of his presidential library. She scribbled this into her ledger without comment. It was late, and I was tired, so I declined the landlady's offer of supper, which appeared to consist of a bowl full of boiled writhing tentacles, swimming in a mixture of brine and goat's milk, and are retired to my room. As I opened the door, I revealed the nearly swooned. It was cramped and filthy, and the wallpaper depicted ungodly patterns in colors beyond any spectrum known to human science, and lines and shapes of some bizarre alien geometry. I flung myself onto the fantastically uncomfortable bed and prayed for sleep. for several hours, I tossed and turned, but eventually I lost consciousness. How I wish I had not that night, for the first time since infancy, my dreams were haunted by the grumpy man. Most people of my generation will be familiar with this loathsome monster. It was common when I was a child, for parents to frighten their children to sleep, with spine tingling tales of this creature, dwelling in a deep dark, dank cave, Harry and grunting and covered in sores and separating boils, a hideous being older than the universe. Oh, older than time and space, grunting, drooling, stinking and ever prepared to come lumbering out of the more of his cave to visit unimaginable havoc upon the innocent. Grumpy man had terrified me as a tiny tot, and he terrified me now for more so because the nightmare was so inexplicably vivid

Frank Key  15:02
Eventually, mercifully, I awoke from this hideous Phantasm I was twitching and shattered. After cursory ablutions. I went downstairs to the breakfast room. When I saw that breakfast was the same bowl of tentacles is the supper of the night before I excused myself and crashed unsteadily out of the door. I decided to head straight for the campus to seek out Professor Nyala photo tip. The sooner I obtained comprehensive details of my commission, and signed a contract, the sooner I could leave this benighted wretched, vile seaside hellhole. After a short bus ride to the campus, it was a simple enough matter to locate the faculty of blasphemous and forbidden studies. And once inside to find the professor's office. A young woman was sitting at a desk in the ante room. You must be Mr. Key, she said. I am Miss dimity cashew, the professor's secretary. I'm afraid he's not here. Right now. He is off somewhere or other consulting an abominable tome written in an unknown and possibly best deal alphabet. She was a pilot an asymmetrical figure, with a clubfoot and one with a leg. A withered arm, several extra fingers on one hand and several fingers missing on the other eyes of different colors, which seemed always to be looking in wildly different directions. And her lank hair was scattered with breadcrumbs and a twig or two. I was transfixed by Dementedly thumping hearts in ready to burst from my breast. I could barely speak, but I managed to splatter some incoherent words. dimity agreed to join me for a stroll along the ins mouth promenade. It was a whirlwind romance. And five days later, we were married in some big burly big church. Only on the morning after our wedding night did I snap out of my lovestruck days and remember why I had come to ns mouth in the first place. The Authorized Biography of the Mad Arab Abdul alhazred I cried. I must go to see the professor at once. These words had a strange effect on my new bride. dimity seemed to shrink visibly and clutched desperately. The bedsheets already powered, what little color there was drained from her face. She shook her head violently sending twigs and breadcrumbs flying from her and care across the room. And then, for the first time since I had met her, both her eyes swivels to fix in the same direction. And she looked straight at me. For God's sakes he screamed. But what the page of the show goes down the 6000 steps, the abomination of abominations. I never would let him take me and then I found myself there. I yeah. Nigga Ross, the hooded zing. bleated King kamag kamag in the place of utter blasphemy, I can't stand it. I can't stand it. My brave is tugging from beyond knocking clawing. For a goat with 1000 young, Oh, God. Like a fool. I dismissed this as delirium, a fit of the vapors. I told dimity to have a nice cup of tea and to get some more sleep, and I hurried out towards the faculty office, and had I been known it towards my own destruction. There is little more to tell. I ran to the faculty building and through into the ante room, past devotees empty desk until I stood at the professor's door. I knocked and heard from inside are weird. eldritch, unfathomable, rustling and panting and grunting. I threw open the door and rushed in and found myself in a room as deep and dark and dank as the Cave of the grunty man. It was like it was the Cave of the grumpy man. And they're in the Stygian blackness. looming before me was the grumpy man himself in the form of the withered, ancient figure of Professor Nyala hotep. Aha. Last he wheezed, I have been waiting for you. Every 10,000 years. I require a new host body, and here you are.

Frank Key  19:58
And before I had time to scream or flee the hideous being shot across the darkness towards me and somehow inserted itself body and soul into my very being into me. I felt it settle, adjusting it to horrible contours to mine feeling its way into me physically and mentally. Desperately I clung on to a small corner of my brain that remained my own. I have continued to cling to it for as long as I can, but I grow weaker and weaker, and the me that clings will soon be no more. That is why I ran as fast as I could to this lunatic asylum, and that gunpoint demanded to be confined in a padded cell. It's walls and locks will keep humanity safe for a time. But the time will come years centuries hence, when the locks will rust and the walls crumble. And then the grunty man will lumber fourth in his awful grunting horror, and he shall have dominion over the earth, and all the other planets in all the other universes forever and ever. For I am the grumpy man.

Frank Key  21:36
So that was called Mr. Key goes to ns mouth and it was of course based heavily on the works of Martin Amos. This is something else.

cocking a snook is an age old custom in pointy town, harking back to the days of Bruno lapu. Bell, or even earlier. It is unrelated to the Snoop cocking practiced elsewhere in the world. That's not the same thing at all. No, it is not. Oh, no, no. What I am talking about then, what what am I talking about? Then when I talk about the specifically pointed down practice, or practice as the post modernist philosopher who look postmodern would put it a cockiness nuke Am I just babbling incoherently? No, I am not. Oh, no, no, not at all. We may go back to the earth text in this matter, the centuries old great book of Bruno lapu Bell, in which we find this passage. granted to the modern listener it is gibberish but bear with me Have patience. This is what we read. Wheat goose Peck out sick Fido. Robert Papa Hemingway in storm drain. Que Rhone sow's ear with wah wah pedal. Wah wah pedal been birds without ears. Ooh, look, teabag, hen coop protocol, baffling, fiery fiery Fidos set pictures of jack girls in censuses. religio madikwe earn burial. Early scritti Natty jar that he cocked nappy Snoop, Natty dread. roughly translated this means? Well, it's so roughly translated, it can hardly be called the translation I for one can make head nor tail of it. The important thing is that the words caulk and smoke can both be spotted in the passage and in close proximity. So that tells us something. What does it tell us? At the very least it tells us that both caulk and Snoop were words in usage in pointy town at the time of the composition of the great book of Bruno lapu. Bell, so we're getting somewhere. Oh, yes, we are. When I suffered a burst appendix, and they put me on a stretcher. I had visions. Yes, I did. I'm not making this up. One of these visions was of an ancient pointy town out gathering snoops. I saw a vision as if through a mist, a thick mist such that I could not clearly discern the pointy Towner put it like this, I wouldn't be able to identify him in a police lineup. The same is true of the snoops he was gathering. Oh, thick, thick mist, how you blurred my sight As I lay on that stretcher with a burst appendix. In another vision following swiftly On the first the ancient pointy Towner was cocking the snoops he gathered this to was obscured by nest More's the pity. And most of the potty if you want to know, and I'm sure you do, I'm quite sure. Oh yes I am. There was a hell of a lot of patinas abroad at that time. What a time it was a potty time potty of an ever before or after, even now. Now the goal is turned to lead and you are lying in your bed with curtains drawn across the night. I hug you or pebble hug it tight, though you may plead and you may pray. The grumpy man is on his way.

Frank Key  26:19
And those of you who know Edward gorey will know the story of little Henry klump the pious infant whose story is told in the pious infant, ostensibly by Mrs. Ruggiero dowdy, it's one of Edward gorey, great books. And I must say when I read it, I thought, surely, there could never have been an infant as pious as Henry klump. But when I was doing the research, for my book, Mr. Keys, shorter, potted brief, brief lived, which you can still buy, it would be nice if a few people did and it failed to become a best seller. Anyway, I did learn about another a genuine, pious infant, not a fictional one, called Saint Rumbold. And he makes Henry klump seem like the spawn of Satan. So this is the brief brief life of Saint run wild and is historically true. St. Grunwald was born in King Sutton in 622 ad, the son of St. signer burger and King outfitted his first words uttered on the day of his birth where I am a Christian. He then asked to be baptized, and to receive Holy Communion. The next day, he preached a sermon, quoting freebie from Scripture. On the third day, he gave another sermon addressed his parents, after which he keeled over and died, we can be sure he ascended directly into heaven. So that's timed Rumbold for you a pious infant indeed, and others quite a pious infant, but I'll tell you all about that next week. Thank you for listening. I hope you've enjoyed it. I'll see you next week. And thanks very much to Sarah for doing the engineering in jobs absence. Bye bye
