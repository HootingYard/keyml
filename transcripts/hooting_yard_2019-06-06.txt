Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Excuse me, the shark known in Flemish, my mother tongue as Ian in hundred on bite, which is not a literal translation of hooting out on the air. But in fact, in Honda non bite means a dog's breakfast. But apparently that's what my call is shown flounders. I don't know about what am I Oh, Nia, and let's get on with it. Blodgett had a certain militaristic cast his character. So when he was given command of a pocket battleship, it was understandable that he got slightly carried away. He fretted and fast over his epaulettes and other trimmings on his uniform, to a somewhat embarrassing degree, so much so that he neglected a more crucial, he neglected more crucial aspect of his duty, such as keeping a proper log. Thus it is that we do not have a reliable record of his one and only voyage. This was a time of gunboat diplomacy. And Blodgett mission was to anchor his ship in a faraway by train his guns on the coast, and threaten to blow the township there to smithereens unless certain conditions were met. Or very straightforward, or it would have been had the ship not had for its navigator, a man who has lost his wits. This fellow's name was Trump's shoe, and it's a wonder that he still had the confidence of the Admiralty, for he had been bonkers for years. Instead of steering the ship towards the far away by Trump, you're show pored over his charts and barked instructions through a pneumatic funnel that led to the ship becoming encased in Pac eyes, thousands of nautical miles away from its proper destination. There was no township upon which to train the guns, leaving Blodgett at a loss what to do, other than to preen his epaulettes and other trimmings with a little brush. troubleshoot, meanwhile, was following his own demented star. He took the pacing up and down the poop deck shouting at the sky. icicles formed on the brim of his navigator's cap, but he seemed impervious to the cold. Not so the rest of the crew huddled below decks wrapped in blankets, and keeping their spirits up by playing board games and eating sausages. Blodgett kept his cabin using his log as a pad for doodling. He had lost radio contact with the Admiralty weeks ago, there was nothing for it, but to sit the winter out and wait for the ice to melt. At this point, I expect the majority of listeners will be avid for further details of the board games on the sausages, and I will not disappoint. However, before dealing with these crucial topics, perhaps it's wise to say a few more words about Trump. Sure. His insanity was not in doubt. But what has never been established is whether he deliberately stranded the ship in Antarctic waters, or whether within the vaporous murk of his mad brain, he honestly believed the ship was heading for that far away by

there might be a clue in the words he was shouting at the sky, while pacing the poop deck. And by chance we do have a record or be fragmentary of what they were, or some of them at least by count and airship packed to the gills with the very latest magnetic cylinder recording technology past overhead one day and some of Crump shore shouting was picked up by it monitors and etched onto a cylinder preserved forever. If you got a special coupon for entry to the sound recordings, rooms of the museum at or near ACC or The vog, you can listen to this bewildering catalogue. Paul Dobson once planned a pamphlet on Blodgett voyage and transcribed part of Trump chose to raid, but abandon the essay in favor of his justly famous bilgewater elegies. Thanks to Dobson though, we can reprint the shouting and gain an eerie insight into the crack brain navigator pacing the poop deck on that ice gut pocket battleship so many many years ago. What wheat bulgur wheat begins the Dobson transcription, wheat and gravel and sand and grit, powdered placed, placed in puddles, gravel and sand, a criminy. Picture and tar and globules of black black, black and glue. Cracking pods squelching underfoot pods of booze and glue pitted black olives in a jar put it on black, like a black pit, crack bulgur wheat and cracking sand, black pudding, vinegar down your throat, molten muck on the foot in vast paced puddles of goo. It is difficult to know precisely what to make of this except to conclude that Trump's role was completely off his head and that charts and barked instructions to the crew notwithstanding, navigation was not uppermost in his mind. That being so we can get on to the more diverting business of the board games and the sausages as promised. The ship's cook was a follower of the dietary theories of can speak on get the sorry can speak to get and that being the case there was little if any animal flesh in his sausages. Why might when munching occasionally stick one's teeth into a fragment of pig or goat or Starling Bernier tiny fragment, often so tiny as to go unnoticed. The cook made his sausages from an EU get approved compaction of mashed up turnips and marshland, reeds and grasses, leavened with some sort of secret curd by came in two sizes jumbo and cocktail. Although the latter were not served on cocktail stick, due to get stern prohibition of sausage piercing holes. Even the very weak ones made by the average cocktail stick was anathema to the dietitian for reasons propounded in the preface to his magisterial Codex sausage IANA. Even if you're not particularly interested in sausages, this book is a fantastic read, and I cannot recommend it too enthusiastically. I try to read a few paragraphs every day. Much of some people dip daily into the Bible or into prudence foxgloves, when some thoughts for the dim witted mantra of the ship's cargo hold was occupied by the cooks crates of sausage ingredients, and he was forever puffing and blustering about his galley needing the turnip and marshland weeds and grasses and secret curd, and occasional bits of pig and goat and styling into the sausages, in which he took such pride inspecting every single one with a powerful microscope to ensure that it was free of even the most miniscule hole. And of course, the crew gobbled them down greedily at mealtimes, both jumbo and cocktail varieties, for they have nothing else to eat. That's quite enough about sausages.

Blodgett had made it a condition of his command of the pocket battleship, that it be stocked with lots and lots of board games. And so three entire cabins below the all up deck was stacked with them from family favorites such as Pluto crack, dentists potting shed, and to the Finland station. To more obscure games like treat the dropsy with leeches book true shop railings and fictional athletes Bob lit two volts cement running track Challenge Cup Heat for on the rare occasions he popped his head into the cabin where the crew huddled together for warmth through that freezing polar winter. Blodgett was always pleased to see that they were kept fully occupied by one board game or another. The gang of sailcloth patches particular pleasure in patch that sale of Fast and Furious yet at times slow moving game involving equal measures of cutting and luck. The board itself represented a piece of sail cloth, and indeed was made of sail cloth, and the players took it in turns, by throwing dice and moving their counters to patch up the various rips and rents in the cloth with a needle and thread. Meanwhile, over in one corner of the cabin Blodgett was shorter find the crow's nest men playing a sprightly game of growling widow, a contest so fiendishly complicated that only the superior brain pans of the crow's nest men had a chance of understanding it. Other less bright sailors would watch gulping for hours, as counters flew around the board spinners respond, card packs consulted, and little plasticine models of characters from the Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann were put in place knocked over, taken the pieces remodeled, repainted, and had their heads pulled off and substituted with special bonus tokens. Only a fresh pan of sausages from the galley would interrupt the crow's nest men's concentration when they would sulkily take a break to feed having taken snapshots of the board from several different angles to prevent cheating. And so the winter wore on until one day the ice melted away and the pocket battleship sailed home. Trump shore had abandoned ship by this time stomping off across the ice flows in curiously subdued fashion, no longer shouting at the sky, his face, barely visible behind the thick row of icicles dangling from the brim of his cap, stooping occasionally, to pluck some kind of primitive edible life form from the cold, cold sea with his further mittened fist. Blodgett watched from the prow of the battleship as his navigator vanished into the white nothingness. weeks later, they began the return voyage guided by the stars, which one of the crow's nest men knew how to read. Blodgett was of course hold before the Admiralty stock chamber to account for himself. Why had he failed to sail to the faraway bay for a spot of gumbo gung ho Gung, Gung ho gunboat diplomacy, he burbled and babbled and preen dissemble lattes and other trimmings, but at no point did he ever mentioned Trump? Sure. He had even expunged the navigators name from the list of crew pinned up on a post at the entrance to the star chamber. And inevitably, there is no reference to Trump, you're in Blodgett, hopelessly inadequate Captain's log, which, I suppose begs the question. Did Trump ever actually exist? Or was he a race or a phantom, or even a guru of the kind known? ships of the line is like, ply the oceans sailing round and round and round into the Maelstrom.

I have a post bag full of letters from listeners, asking me to explain the rules of the board game dentist potting shed mentioned in that piece. Now I hate to disappoint but I simply can't be bothered to write pages and pages about what is after all, a spectacularly down game. Excuse me. Believe me when I tell you that if I started trying to explain to the beginner how to play dentists potting shed, we would be here all day, and probably tomorrow too. And even then, we would have got little further than the first Trump got. I would of course have to try to explain the meaning of a curb gutter myself. And that's only one of new new numberless terms a player has to understand before the dice are even thrown. So I'm afraid that on this occasion I'm gonna ignore my employee listeners. If you want to play dentist potting shed governed by a set and read up on the rules yourself. You might want to wait until next year However, when a special edition is being released on the sixth of February 2020, Huberman will have in stock the dentist's potting shed commemorative edition, marking the 50th anniversary. Oh, hang on. I read I wrote I originally, okay, intermission. This is a parent technical statement. I originally wrote this story. Good god 12 years ago. So in 2007. And, in fact, the year I said 2026, February 2020. But actually the year becomes quite important. So I'm going to start that paragraph again. And when I say next year, imagine yourself back in the year 2007. End of intermission, you might want to wait until next year, however 2000 2008 when a special edition is being released, on the sixth of February 2008, Huberman will have in stock the dentist's potting shed commemorative edition marking the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. This special set will include small plastic figurines of Duncan Edwards, Jeff bent, Liam Whelan, and the other Busby Babes who perished as a result of the crash. The figurines are not an integral part of the board game. So I think the idea is that you can display them on your mantel piece. If you have a mantel piece or elsewhere, such as on a shelf. If you do not have a mantel piece and arrange them so that they appear to be watching the game of dentist potting shed, you will then proceed to play with your pals. Some may think it's eerie to be watched over by footballers ghosts, in which case, the fingerings can be left to languish in the little thrum dimity bag provided. Given the complexity and tedium of the game, it's hard to account for its popularity. Last year at bodgers spinny. An international tournament attracted competitors from as far away as the port of tongs and tickets to watch the final sold out within seconds. The tickets themselves have become collector's items. And I have to say, though very beautiful as ticket to go cardboard and beige and cat just so I've managed to amass six so far at unholy cost, one from a beekeeping acquaintance, one abandoned and a nest of thorns, one sold to me by a ragamuffin one stuck to a decoyed duck in a pond, while I suspect to be a forgery, or one I found being used as a bookmark in a secondhand copy of Dobson's pamphlet. What planet does Jeanette Winterson live on? I did not go to the dentist potting shed tournament myself, partly because as I have made clear, I find the game unremittingly boring, but partly because I'm terrified of ever going near bulges spinny again, it's almost three years to the day that last I lumbered towards the spinny. And still I shudder every time I recall the gigantic hobgoblins that jumped down from the trees and pursued me all the way back to blister lane.

Frank Key  18:50
They were not only gigantic but crumpled and toothless and stained with vinegar and covered in arrow route biscuit crumbs and sweat. Should you ever find yourself being chased away from a spinny or cops by hobgoblins. prey it's not the ones who chased me on that grim November day. Although I did not go to the tournament, I read every single press report I could find. I was less interested in the board game than in the possibility that the hobgoblins would disrupt things, scattering the dice and counters and cards and terrifying the players. But no matter how thoroughly I scoured the papers, I discovered nothing hobgoblin related, I could only assume that they had clambered back up into the trees and remained hidden in leafage allowing the dentist's potting shed tournament to play itself out in the wind and the rain. I was perplexed by this until I read the following spring. a lengthy article in the bulletin of barges spinny hobgoblin In behavioral studies, written by an academic pan Gendron, which explained everything in prose so crisp, it took my breath away. If you want to read it to look out for the issue of the bulletin with a picture of Celine Dion on the cover. I mentioned that I obtained one of my six tickets by buying it from Matt ragamuffin what you might think was a ragamuffin doing in possession of such a prized piece of beautifully cut by cardboard. I was certainly tempted to assume that the nipper had pickpocketed it. He was tiny and bonyen as skinny as a pipe cleaner, and it was easy to imagine him skittering uncatchable through busy city street, dipping and smacking was like committing a crime by paying the ragamuffin for stolen goods. I did not like to think of myself as a fence, and I remained troubled until one week after the exchange had taken place. I tracked him to the traveling circus of which he was an unlikely veteran. I learned that from the age of just five months, he had been known as how long a monkey boy and that his Daredevil aerobatic acrobatics, performed without a safety harness were famed throughout the circus world ragamuffin he may have been, but he was no thief. He explained to me that one of his colleagues and mustachioed nincompoop known as the human pencil sharpener was a was a besotted devotee of dentists potting shed had attended the tournament when the circus was in camp nearby in screwin hunahpu and had given the ticket to the ragamuffin as a birthday present. satisfied by the tail relieved that I was not a fence. I stayed around to watch that evening circus performance. It was bloody fantastic, especially howler monkey boy himself, at whose antics I gasped. I even got to have one of my own pencils sharpened by the human pencil sharpener, whose teeth marks can still be seen upon it, for I have not written with it since instead, keeping it in a little tin display crate on my mantelpiece for I have a mental piece. If next year I succumb to the fad and by the special edition of dentist potting shed, I may have to move the tin crate to make room for the Busby Babes figurines. That will be a quandary, but I shall deal with it as best I can. What I might do is obtain a wooden panel and nail it up as a sort of mantle piece extension. It would not look pretty, but it would create more display space and who knows what further baubles and giggles I will want to add as the years pass. And the years will pass of course. And I'm glad of that for as each year passes. I hope and pray that the memory of the budget spinny hobgoblins, pursuing me across the field will one day begin to fade and that there will come a time when I might sleep through the night without waking in terror, shuttering and screaming and scaring the Wits out of my cat Jeffrey, for I will consider my cat Jeffrey.

Two pieces one about Blodgett and crop shore and then about the board games ended up taking up nearly the entire show to the point where I don't really have time to start reading you anything else. Because the material I have with me is there's nothing among the pieces of short enough. You could say that I should have prepared myself better. And maybe I'll sit at home. Maybe some maybe some listeners think I sit at home carefully timing how long it takes to read these pieces, but I don't I just come into the studio and make sure that Well, I'm not making up as I go along, but read whatever comes to hand, and then find myself with free time at the end of the show. So what can we say? Well, for I will consider my cat, Jeffrey, you will, I hope recognize, of course, as a line from Google Art I agno. by Christopher smart. And interestingly, as we discovered that piece that I've just read, I originally wrote in 2007, and 2007 is the same year that together with germander, speedwell, the voice artist or whatever, she's known as a tremendous speed while and I read the entire dhruba latte agno as a as a resonance, Christmas special, give us a Christmas special. And it took us three hours to do so. But it's still available online. And I know residents have repeated it occasionally. But should you ever want to spend three profitable hours? You can find online if you put dhruba latte agno. Frank key germander speedwell into Google search, other search engines are available. You should be able to track it down I think is on the Internet Archive. But it's great. It's three hours of Christopher smart at his finest. The DRI bollati agma. I heartily recommend listening to that. What else have we got to say for ourselves? Well, it's the race the the anniversary, the 75th anniversary of D day, today. And one thing occurred to me is that 75 years ago, always young people from England and America and Britain and America and Canada and God knows where else landed on the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazis, to defeat fascism. Real fascism real Nazis. And these, you know, they're they're equivalent today with her on about, I don't know, trivia, and narcissism and and their own, what pronoun should be used about them and all that kind of stuff? And you think there is no comparison? Really, I mean, it's very easy to sit at home complaining about things on Twitter. But you know, those people who are now in their 90s actually fought real Nazis and defeated them. And maybe it's because people maybe it's because young people today don't actually have a great cause. So they have to find little causes. I don't know that these things just I've wondered about them as the day went on. I was going to mention something else that happened today, but it might be a bit. It said it said negative comment about something. So I don't think I will say it. I mean, I've just complained about one thing that gets me about always with Twitter mobs and warriors on online is, why don't I do something useful instead of whinging about things I don't like I could actually do something to make the world a better place. like picking up litter. Or john deere said killing themselves, but I think that was rather that's that's a rather extremist point of view. But you know, they could pick up litter instead of sitting there typing, Trump's a Nazi, and all that. bollocks. If you're allowed to say that word on air, maybe you're not. So I apologize. Well, I think that's nearly used up the time. I

hope you've enjoyed the show. Sorry about the last five minutes of of topical Wittering. I'm as bad as the people I'm criticizing. But yes, Gavin listen to dribble as a agno and go to the hooting yard website, which will be updated one of these days. I promise you, and I'll probably be back next week, unless I have to have another injection in my eye. But I don't think I have to have one of those next week. All right. That's it. Bye bye.
