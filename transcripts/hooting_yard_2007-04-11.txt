Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM and this is hooting out on the air. Half an hour of pros with me Frank key and I am an adept of Fang P. But I can't divulge any more the time for the time being. But when I start my Fang p evening class course I'll be sure to let you know. Far Far away there is a galaxy have shattered stars, stars crumpled and curdled and destitute and there is a planet tucked in among the sorry stars, a tiny pink planet of gas and water and thick foliage and tucked in among the fronds and creepers and enormous leaves of this foliage, live billions of unhatched eggs, and when they hatch, they will hatch millions of magnetic mute blind love monkeys. I am a crew member of the starship corrugated cardboard, heading implacably through deep space towards the galaxy of crumpled stars. Seven years into the voyage, only four of us remain from the original manifest of 20 there is my captain. Oh my captain pill brow, a hirsute raving martinet. We have tied him with cords and confined him to a cupboard for he has become impossibly dangerous. His spittle is sulfurous. It burns that widget touches and as he raves, he spits and he is never not raving, not any more. Ever since we passed through the belt of illegible pill brow seems no longer human. Being the science officer, I tried to study him at first, wearing big protective gloves. I transferred flex of his spittle into my Alembic and ignited my Bunsen burners and peered intently at pill brows, burning spittle, hoping to learn something I learned nothing. We have traveled far far beyond the belt of illegible and still I have learned nothing faster the binding with chords and thus the cupboard also surviving is pill brow to a half size version of my captain Oh my captain, made of cardboard wax and string an animated with life by sparks of something akin to but not quite electricity pill browser to is in drew bitterly alive, a pulsating rustling thinking breathing thing, but it has nothing in common with the raving martyr net tied by chords in the cupboard. At the beginning of the voyage, we considered changing its name. We even spent a few days calling it unpeeled brow or anti pill brow. But neither of these caught on possibly because pill brow two would boom. My name is pill brow to in its deafening voice. Our cardboard wax and string crewmate has been invaluable in keeping our spirits up. I do not think we would still be heading for the galaxy of crumpled and destitute stars and for the tiny pink planet. If it were not for its determination. Lumpkin would have had us turn back. I'm sure of it. lumpen is the other survivor. He has been morose and sullen since we ran out of breakfast cereal two years ago. After missing the supply Depo on the planet of grocery provisions epsilon six, where we withdrew to collect a consignment of Kellogg's fruit and fiber. He keeps to his bunk now head buried in a metal back copy of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. His pipe clenched in his teeth, the fumes of his untreated Serbian tobacco hanging in the pseudo heir of the cabin. At least it kills the flies. The bullet riddled corpses of our dead crew mates all 16 of them, a coffin and the coffin stacked as a makeshift ping pong table. we clear the space in the cargo hold by jettisoning some crates of irrelevant rubbish we were meant to be delivering to one of the outlying mini planets of Hubbard world. There will be hell to pay if we ever get home. But home season seems so far away Now, so far, far away. Pilbara two is a superb ping pong player, never letting its bat get caught in its string. But I am better. We have played thousands of games over the years and I have won nearly all of them sometimes without losing a point because it has no heart pill brow to is not disheartened and comes to every match with the same valiant perkiness that keeps us plunging ever further through space towards the galaxy of shattered stars. One afternoon

after a particular grueling ping pong match pill brow to confess to me that what kept it going? What kept it tweaking the boosters to increase our speed, even at the cost of sending the starship into judders, which popped some of the bolts on the pseudo air seals was that it was filled with a burning last for the as yet unhatched magnetic mute blind love monkeys patiently awaiting birth on the tiny pink planet. This was the first I had heard of them. I became confused and flung question after question at the half size cardboard wax and string simulacrum of my captain. Oh, my captain, but it answered none of them. Instead, it showed me pages of twee love poetry it had been writing and led me to a corner of the cargo hold, where it had hidden a stash of love tokens, mostly things made out of some kind of tin flowers and lockets and broaches, finicky bitty Bob's it was going to bestow upon the magnetic commute blind love monkeys, once they were born. When I protested that there were supposedly millions of these monkeys pill brow to explain to me with a winsome sigh, that its love knew no bounds, and nor did it last for when it had been programmed back in the lab that gave it life. A stray spark had imbued it with a super abundance of love. Last and ping pong perkiness. I wondered whether they share these revelations with lumpen but what would be the use patting pill brow to on its cardboard head. I picked up my ping pong bat and challenged it to win again. And we played and played and played as my captain. My Captain pill brow raved and spat and struggled with his binding cords in his cupboard with played his lump and smoked his pipe and read Ayn Rand for the thousandth time, we played as the starship corrugated cardboard hurdled inexorably through space towards the galaxy of stars shattered and stars crumpled stars curdled and stars destitute. Were in Nestle the tiny pink planet of gas and water and thick foliage were in Nestle millions of unhatched eggs were in Nestle millions of unhatched magnetic mute blind love monkeys are waiting they're unlikely Romeo, a cardboard wax and string simulacrum of my captain. Oh my captain, called hillbrow to baring poetry and love tokens far far away.

That story was taken from the forthcoming second hooting yard book. If you haven't already bought befuddled by cormorants go to the hooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org and buy a copy. And the the next book which should be out in the next few weeks is has the snappy title, unspeakable desolation pouring down from the stars. And last week's show ended with something from that book. The detective mystery fangs in the mist and it was faded out faded out as the program came to an end. And I haven't had a chance to read much of it. So I'm going to read chapter one of fangs in the mist. While Hugh was sliding on the lake, he fell and sprained his wrist. My sister has a blue veil made of goals. The old woman got a skein of worsted and began to knit her stocking. The lawyer made a very awkward mistake. The geese plucked some wool from the fleece of the sheep.

The cook pierced her arm with a skewer and bruised a sinew. The laundry man gave his niece a pair of gloves and asked her to repair the seams. He had a piece of quartz in his hand, he let it fall amongst the cinders. We have no color flowers in our garden, but we have turnips and spinach. I will give you a snowdrop for that crocus. My uncle arrived on a Wednesday evening in February when the fire had burned the joists. The roof of the castle fell in the orphan child. Enjoy Her coarse bread and her draft of water. Be careful to shun vicious neighbors. A railway guard should be an honest man and should never taste liquor. The Ostler is a saucy knave. He refused to fasten my stirrup, the air in bad humor, cut his thumb with a knife. You cannot see through wood. It is opaque. The Wrestler fell from the bow of a large and broke his collarbone. This piece of chalk will not weigh half an ounce. That bunch of time has a pleasant scent. his guilt is undoubted, and that his cousin who was in league with him is strongly suspected. They got Lyme from the kilm and began to repair the aisle of the church. Do you hear the mice knowing the wind Scott and that bit me on the creek and caused me great pain. The prisoner would not deign to kneel before the judge. The data rose in great Roth and tried to knock his captor down. The vi count when cruising in his yacht, so a wreck of the beach.

The baker must weigh the dough before he puts it in the oven. The calf fell into the sow, so we called the veterinary surgeon. The priest is acquainted with several foreigners, the shepherd found a corpse in the forest. The villain has no moral character and as a disgrace to his family. The surgeon was on the point of yielding when the hostess interfered. When I pointed the muzzle of the gun at him, he very cunningly feigned death. The monks commended their earning brother to the mercy of the deity. The crowd was composed chiefly of rowdy and violent persons. While Pat was riding his chestnut horse, the rains broke. My cousin is a martyr to toothache. he prophesied that there would be a thunderstorm before the morning, the manager has invented a new system of telegraph signals. He had scarcely crossed the line when he was seized by a policeman. Example is better than precept and good advice has double white when offered by one who practices what he advises.

When sailing in his canoe on the canal, he was capsized and nearly drowned. ozio twigs make excellent baskets. Sulfur is dug out of the earth in Italy and South America. In Holland, the stalk is protected by law because it eats all the frogs and worms that would injure the dikes. The war finger was not only sightless, he also became utterly death. Their navigational ways were profoundly mysterious. My knife is gone, and none of the children know where it is. The teacher reminded the pupils how admirably and excellently God has regulated everything in the world. The engineer missed the way again, instead of going into his own house, he went into a vat of his neighbor. At this intelligence he stood as if struck with palsy. Do not forget to put on your cloak. It is very cold and stormy. The watchmakers soaked his feet in a tub of hot water. He was carrying the box on his head. I have not seen him for six months. He tied the parcel tightly so that the thing should not come out. Not withstanding this, the string broke. He cannot see the necessity for doing it again. He is the same age as his cousin. The lady appears to be taller than her mother. Those who are idle are seldom happy. The windows are not shot. It was a very austere garden. You should try to memorize everything you are hearing. Show the manual ticket as you go in. My sister has obtained a very large sponge.

I have been appointed sold agent for the sale of this machine. The boxes were nearly all broken and their contents much damaged by water. The servant has disarranged cabinet. In great states, hundreds must starve in order that one may gourmandise and rebel. 10s of thousands are oppressed and hunted to death, that one crowned fool or philosopher may gratify his whims.

In that exciting detective story fangs in the midst all of the clues for the mystery for the resolution of the mystery are there. Many years ago, I decided to do an experiment by living on a subsistence diet of grool for a while, and I want my listeners to understand that this is a true story. I think I was pandering to my aesthetic puritanical streak, for the duration of the exercise is crude, all other foodstuffs, even to the point where I was tempted neither by pap nor by slops around the same time I read somewhere that krill was the food of the future. This appealed to me hugely, but gruul seemed easier to come by than krill. And that's by way of introduction to my recent discovery of another alleged food of the future in the form of puoi. A thoroughly exciting dish from Hawaii. Point is made from the taro plant, which is apparently the 14th most cultivated crop on Earth. The root or comb of the taro is cooked for hours and hours, and then pounded into a sticky goo that has the consistency of library paste, which makes it especially appealing to those of us who are bookish one or the other great things about boy is that you can dispense with cutlery as it shovels daintily into the mouth using your bare hands. So if you're on the lookout for a sour paste to serve as your staple diet, poi seems to be the thing. And maybe after eating a delicious bowl of glue, you might wish to engage in fire dancing, fire twirling, fire spinning, or fire swinging for all of which you can use fire puoi and if you want to know more, I suggest that you join an online fire twirler community, of which there are a number put online fire twirler community into Google and see what happens. Food and fire whoever said that hooting yard was not a repository of essential information for a fulfilling life. And also news that well now that London is going to be hosting the 2012 Olympic Games. It's created something of a kerfuffle in the hemoglobin towers annex. Mrs. gubbins is insisting that she wants to be the captain of team hooting yard and to take part in the volleyball widdershins and indoor Puck related contests. Even though she'll be well over 90 by the time of the games. She's already designed the blazer for the team with straw pockets, though she hasn't explained What's to be kept in them, nor indeed why they're special. No actually seen fit to tell the rest of the staff why she wants them to rub orange peel into their scalps each morning for the next five years. My guess is that she's been reading the discredited sports scientist plod gatt, whose teachings have such disastrous consequences for the duggleby brothers in the 1924 Olympic Games. We've set up a shadow Organizing Committee without telling Mrs. gubbins laughing off that I have my spies everywhere comment she's forever muttering from her toothless gums. This despite the fact that we know that she does have spies, seemingly hundreds of them. How she keeps them on her payroll is anyone's guess. But perhaps the series of burglaries over at the budget spinny retail Park and adventure playground has something to do with it. Every now and then, lac gubbins makes a series of strange cropping movements with her hand. I'm not sure why I mentioned that. Team hooting yard, the gubbins one or the shadow one or both, will of course be competing in every single event come 2012 we've already commandeered that strip of grass near the blister lane bypass as a training ground, built a little fence and have plenty of buckets of water on hand. You may want to memorize our team's song which goes like this. hooting yard, hooting yard haha and good Zeebo, we will vanquish all our foes Where have all the flowers gone? hooting hooting yard?

The best way to eliminate the pitch black pit of Doom is to tap into it some blazing Excelsior saturated with turpentine. But that's not as easy as it sounds, mark my words. I have long argued that the pit of doom becomes less Doom laden when illumined despite the Craven voices of my opponents, and they are many, they've used the correspondence columns of many distinguished journals to attack my views. And I have until now refrain from answering their charges. They are a hectic bunch of cowards, ignoramuses and pond life, and I have had better things to do with my time. Why then you might ask, Do I now deign to respond to them? I have no intention of answering that question, perhaps, but perhaps all will become clear as you listen or not. What I'd like to do is to demonstrate how you can illumine the pit of doom yourself using blazing accelsior or saturated with turpentine. By following my instructions carefully, you will be able to reach your own decision regarding the Dumanis of the pit once it is illumined. My hope is that you will agree with me that it is stripped of much if not all of its Doom once lit. First of all, of course you need to locate the pit of doom. There are many pits which seemingly fit the bill and many of them are shrouded in Dumanis being bleak, unforgiving, dank, dark and hideous to behold. One of Dobson's out of print pamphlets attempted to catalog the pitch in a huge geographical area, which might qualify as Doom laden and it was an impressive piece of work. But the pamphleteer overlook the fact that when one stands on the brink of the pit of doom itself, all doubts vanish. There is a curdling of the guts that tells you exactly where you are. No other pit comes close. This you say to yourself, peering into the pitch black more of the pit of boom, this indeed is the pit of doom. You teeter on the edge, terrified of losing your balance every nerve in your body ready to snap. But you step back, if you're me anyway, and resolved to banish Doom by the simple agency of Blazing Excelsior saturated with turpentine. And that's your next challenge. Having located the pit of doom, you must now get your hands on Excel to turpentine and a box of matches or some equivalent means of ignition. And so you turn your back on the pit of doom, almost insolently and you stride across the malls to the little hovel you noted earlier, and you wrap your knuckles on the door. You're expecting a snag to peasant person to answer your wrapping. And so you are momentarily disconcerted when the hovel door creaks open and you're confronted by a winsome young woman who bears a striking resemblance to Tuesday Weld Greetings, you manage to say, I come in search of Excelsior or turpentine and the means of ignition. Then you have come to the right place, says the Tuesday well, like woman, for here in my hovel, I have all those things. She ashes you inside and you are stunned by the interior, which is done out with much velvet and satin and silk with vases of cut flowers, with space age, plastic furniture and a dazzle of colors, all bathed in an unearthly shimmering light. You are mesmerized by this light. entire days passed by of which you are unconscious, for you have been captivated by Oh Whoo hoo woman who is rearranging your brain cells one by one for purposes either malignant or beneficial, depending on what kind of Whoo hoo woman she is. When you wake from your enchantment, you find that she has placed in your hands a bag of Excelsior, a bottle of turpentine and a box of lucifers. You have been fortunate. She is a woohoo woman devoted to good. Go now she says and do what you must do. You are not aware that your brain has been tampered with nor indeed that you have been in Christ. You step out of the light out of the hovel and make your way across the malls to the pit of Doom.

crouching near its edge you open the bag of Excelsior. It is imperative that you check that it is uninhabited fat hamsters sleep all cold and comfortable in Excelsior, as do hibernating tortoises and other creatures accepting those whose domain is the sea. You rummage through the Excelsior until you are completely satisfied that it is innocent of life, hamster or otherwise, then you open the bottle of turpentine and pour in such an amount that the Excelsior is saturated. Then you seal the bag to ensure that the turpentine does not evaporate. Then you set fire to it with one of the lucifers and then you toss it into the pit of doom. Now you step even closer to the edge, and you peer down into what was until a moment ago and evil pitch black vent into the underworld, but now is lit up. What do you see? I could tell you what I saw on the day last September that I lit up the pit of doom with a blazing Excelsior or saturated with turpentine. I could speak of the unimaginable horrors I saw writhing in terror of the light of the howling that beset my ears. I could had I not had it not had my brain jimmied by the very same Tuesday welders Whoo hoo woman whose mercy means that everything I saw or heard in the pit of doom, lit by blazing Excelsior is forgotten forever more. For now I bask in that shimmering light dressed in my peasant smoke, chewing on a piece of straw. Long last the idiot I always hankered to be

certain aspects of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting is one of those out of print pamphlets by Dobson that is acquired the order of legend, not even the most indefatigable of Dobson Esther's claims ever to have seen a copy, let alone read it, and some authorities doubt that ever existed at all. There is of course the famous alleged cover of the pamphlet which was included in an exhibition held at the Museum at or near akoma valg in 1992, to celebrate the inauguration of the cones hotline, but this is almost certainly a fake. JOHN major's government had introduced the cones hotline a few weeks before the show opened, and cones were matching people's thoughts. Dobson had an abiding interest in cones of all kinds, not just those used for traffic control, and we know that he drafted some notes on cones made of plastic, though those two are mysteriously missing from the archives. It's likely that the pamphleteer would have addressed the topic of plastic cones and baubles and plastic sheeting without finding room for plastic. I'm going to read that sentence again. Is it likely that the pamphleteer would have addressed the topic of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting, without finding room for plastic cones as well? gassed On peut has this to say, there can be no doubt in my mind that certain aspects of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting only exists in the February minds of older wisdom Dobson scholars whose brains have been laid waste long ago they would have downed tonics and invigorated to combat dyspepsia low spirits, nervousness heartburn, colic pains, wind in the stomach or pains in the bowels, headache, drowsiness, kidney and liver complaints. melancholy delirium tremens and intemperance. Now they cannot get their hands on such potions. they pursue hopeless shimmers if you wish to pursue any hopeless shimmers hooting Yod we'll be back next week with another half hour of prose, and at which point I may reveal more about the fact that I'm now and adept of Fang P. Meanwhile, I hope you have a good week and bye bye
