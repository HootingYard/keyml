She done him wrong. So he took revenge. He put her on the bus to Penge. She sat down on the upper deck and bid farewell to tooting back. But the driver got lost and went to henden. That seems the perfect note to end on. But it's not the end. It's the very beginning of this week, hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, and this is resonance 104 point four FM. And this week, slightly different show because I have a special guest. And my special guest is my nephew, Fini burn, who said nepotism was dead. And Vinny is from California. And he's currently touring old Europe. And he's been he started keeping a blog of his travels. And I enjoyed reading it so much that I told him to come here and read it to you. So that's what he's going to do now. Over to you, Vinnie.

Unknown Speaker  01:22
Thank you. So I have one entry in my blog so far. And this is the first time I've ever blogged in my life. And the first time I've ever said anything on the radio. So this is a first for everything. I hope that I don't fit in sputter everything and just make a mess of myself. I'll do it. Week One and two, Dublin and Galway. The cool rains traipse delicately from grey sky to grey ground, vehicle slosh and slithered through the mucky puddles and grateful planting gorge their stem and root and leaf systems with heavy drops of liquid. It is Kingston, Salford, Southwest London and it is September I began I began my journey into the strange and foreign lands of Europa by way of the newfangled flying machine crammed as they are with all manner of merchant in wander and balling babe. I sat beside the portside porthole decrepit and head pain throughout the duration for flight from St. Francis air landing port and the airport of the Dubliners. The local chaps that had built quite a formidable city amongst the rocks and cuase in Verdun rolling hills of the wild land of Aaron. My trip was soothed by a devil of a child flailing madly and cursing vehemently the gods who had dared men to fly. She wanted to go down You see, and there was no way for that to happen except to plunge quite gloriously into the briny waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It would be a good death I thought and rare in its circumstance, but not good enough to justify itself and so I refrained from politely requesting the airship Captain engage in a nosedive maneuver, gravitationally south, the clouds trumped on by beneath us great and uncaring and their solemn duty to spritz the globe. When we landed, I was accosted for some time by local customs officials overworked and understaffed to such an extent that it was two turns of the hour hand before I reached the cubby hole through which I was expected to insert my papers. The red haired Angel looked up at me and down, looked me up and down, gave a nod of silent satisfaction and then raised up a single finger as if calling a waiter to his lonely table. He then proceeded to pick up his telephony device and make a call to a faraway host. They discussed the man's family and then the other man's family, and compared scheduled for about 10 minutes until satisfied. They agreed that they had wasted my time just enough to fulfill the minimum state requirements. I bowed reverently to their studious adherence to policy, and my passport was stamped, now free to trample the Shamrock and the fissile. I wandered through quarter after quarter of postmodern architecture until I began to think that I had died in transit, and that this was my experience of the afterlife to forever trod upon conveyor belts and escalators festooned with quite a large pack of the necessary amenities. Finally, light at the end of the proverbial tunnel, I realized now that I had no idea how to get in contact with my local contact. A man who had shared with my father the halcyon days of youth, stuffing upon porridge and kicking damp leather balls around overgrown fields wedged between council states and darkest Essex. I was overcome with a sudden panic to have come so far only to have to turn around and go back, unable to keep up with the local dialect, a distinct and lilting mixture of my own native tongue and leprechauns mystical chatter. I was greeted heartily by a hail gentleman, and whisked away promptly to a lovely seaside villa. The town of Bray was a choice flower plucked from the capital of laughing minstrel, here a cobbled narrow thoroughfare there arrested in Bend old amusement structure. Over there a lush hillside with a pagan symbol of Christ jammed into its peak. There were chip shops and pubs and the occasional haggard looking pooch and I felt comforted in the welcoming city of My host over the next few days, sunny and chipper with a I took the train to Dublin City, exploring her old alleyways and the mixed nuts bag of bridges jumping over the River Liffey. A good amount of time was spent in St. Stephen's Green. Checking out the flower beds and statues and statuettes and Elizabethan garden was a good place for the writing and for the reading and for the collection. of the days I found myself in dank and dreary public houses, reliving the dreadful lives of the Dubliners and famine and rebellion era Ireland, speaking in hushed tones and laughing in the face of death. thrusting meat pies into my Puerto dappled craw, wary of spies and other Englishman. On one day in particular, I've entered into the National History Museum, where on display I found a peculiar number of stuffed beasts and avian friends jammed with wires and fluff and preservatives. They were often bulbous and glassy in the eyes and not quite so proud as their living relatives. Also for my perusal with the creatures of the sea, dipped into slimy tubes of formaldehyde and mounted insects and arachnids that would tingle the spine of any proper adventurer. I shuddered and continued my grave visit beyond the grave.

Unknown Speaker  06:06
After about a week's worth of doubling, I decided that it would be prudent to move onwards to the wind, the wild and windy west of Ireland. I hopped on an auto bus and allowed it to ferry me through the vast and bountiful farmlands of Aaron dapt here and there with a rainbow assortment of bovine equine and por assign chums to my wave continuously through the tinted glass. I would later discover to my delight that among these native friends with the other or other ungulates like sheep, goats, donkeys and the occasional alpaca alpacas in Ireland, oh, joyous day. Anyway, I reached the West and the centuries old medieval port town of Galway, a lovely place that reminded me of incredibly of Santa Cruz. The Langer is California Township. We're inside one wherein I once spent a few years of youthful and on V and a distinctive sludgy feeling, no matter I explored vigorously, the crannies and hellholes of a gold region sprawl, anxious to discover its secrets like a persistent suitor purchasing drink after drink for a Koi Enchantress, coquettish yet full of noble poise. My place of temporary residence was a nice hostel that had very few people in it, so that I ended up having the room to myself for a few days, sharing it with seven empty bunk beds. I slept badly, but I usually do. On the first night in a room amongst a cadre of Spaniards. I felt the presence of a specter on a bed near me. I sat thumbing through an amusing novel, and I began to suspect that the coughing sniffling and moaning coming from the woman in a nearby bunk was really an echo of an old peasant in the grips of potato famine, doomed to haunt and a hunger forever the room in which she left this world. She was wearing a windbreaker and whimpering, and I knew that I would not get any sleep with her around. I asked to have my room changed successfully and discovered in the process that there was no coughing old woman registered to stay in the old room. Hence, she was definitely a psychic reverberation from hard times. The clouds hung bulbous lay in the sky for the duration, always threatening to piss down at a full bladders, but polite enough to let off until I was about to leave. Oh, what clouds crammed one on top of the other in the heavens, marching outwards forever in all directions. blinking hands is the warm sunlight peek through meekly. I never seen clouds like them, and I do not think I will again. My heart was a flutter and almost got away. For I was also sort of lonely for a time to travel alone in the world. For the first time. It is a frightful thing and intimidated. I felt the wide world clam around me. I was a mound of sand in a dark chamber crushed and slammed by experiences and words and sights and sounds into a fine pearl. I looked at pictures of myself as an innocent baby and wept. Then I realized that I had only been away from home a week and about a half and chuckled ironically to no one in particular, and steeled myself mightily against the oncoming Squall the next two months which will bring them with them a wealth of experiences positive and negative and shaped me, I think into the perfect man. World wary, well traveled street smart and multilingual and impossibly handsome. And go enjoy the company of the white sand beaches formed from the pope titanus remains of a kind of germs and spongy forums and mailed cephalopods, etc. The perfect sound with which to build grand castles is flippant mockery to childish gods who trample over them as angry children do. Then the wave after and when to erode away those marvelous ramparts and moats and vaulted arches that only a master architect and lover of beauty could even begin to envision. I forgot my camera. I also found time to explore the countryside, joining a jolly touring group led by local man about town, which made stops at various crumbling facades and IV choke graveyards. The castles and churches and forts and archaeological sites of old Aaron popped into my imagination grand Memoirs of Mad prideful kings drooping hallucinogenic clergyman painting visions of snakes and glowing crowns upon the crisp paper of massive tomes and the occasional sheep. I expanded my gaze onto the land and envisioned humbleness friars drinking merrily have watered down cruel Grog, humble farmers drinking mud and humble beggars drinking a worse thing. I stared into the darkening recesses of the past into the rain drenched soil, and the soul of the druid in the same plumbing the fourth dimensional depths for some token of knowledge and wisdom that I could bring forth from my reverie. Always look both ways before crossing the road they said, brush twice a day.

Towards the end of my stay, I encountered a few fellow fellow travelers of note to beaming Virginians played a number of recognizable bluegrass tunes sweetly on fiddle and six string guitar, a private show in the common room of the youth hostel. Later, the proprietor of a pie shop turned out to have also taken a leave of study in Santa Cruz. We high fived and said killer and gnarly and reminisced about the golden poppies in the mountains drooping softly into the lazy sunset, I was pumped full of nostalgic pride in my homeland, and left with a single tear passing by a rosy handsome cheek. I then made my way back to Dublin by way of knock the ancestral homeland of my particular branch of the clan O'Brien or burn as we prefer to be called. It has become a religious pilgrimage site and allowed speaker was mumbling the Stations of the Cross endlessly to forevers pilgrims. I didn't stay long, but I realized a bit too late that I was wearing a mildly but an unintentionally satanic t shirt. I said a prayer in my own agnostic way from my cousin Patrick, who passed away on that same day 11 years ago, and felt that he would have appreciated my lapse in judgment and foresight as a number of bearded old babies, I'd been suspiciously. Eventually, I got to England by some magic unknown to me, and with my cousin and his girlfriend who've been kind enough to put me up and put up with me. Now, we will continue onwards, and to a house to drink some beers and enjoy the lovely English weather. So I must end this communication and hand it back off to my uncle. I wish everyone at home Hello well, and elsewhere, equally, hello well, and to all a good night or morning depending on geographical location. Thank you.

Frank Key  12:51
Well, thank you very much Vinnie. And I hope you don't get too lonely and start weeping. And you realize you've only been away from home for two weeks. onto other things. Now, farmers knitwear is a particularly important and engaging topic. I know this because I spoke to a farmer about it. He was a big, florid fellow with a big florid head, and he was leaning against a fence, waving a stick at some cows. I was lost in the countryside. And when I saw him from a distance, silhouetted against a breathtakingly gorgeous sunset, I decided to approach him at speed before he vanished. So I could ask him where I was. Me a seconds later, because I can move jolly fast when I have to. I tipped my hat to him in greeting. He was not wearing a hat, which I thought unusual for a farmer, but one of our farmers, not much as it turned out. For example, not only did I think all farmers wore hats all the time, but I had no idea they were so interested in knitwear, and in discussing it with complete strangers lost in the countryside. Before I had a chance to ask the farmer where I was, he started talking to me about his cardigan. It was he explained, a farmer's cardigan, knitted from wall. See how the length of the sleeves matches the length of my arms, he said, See how the buttons are fastened in a straight vertical line down the middle of the cardigan front. When I am done with my cows for the evening, he said, perhaps you would like to come back with me to my farmhouse where I can show you the niddy Noddy on which the wool for this cardigan was round from the bobbin into a skein. This was a lot for me to take in. And I'm afraid my face must have betrayed a certain hesitancy See, it's all the same to me, said the farmer. And he turned back to his cows and waved the stick at them again. I assured him I would be more than happy to repair to the farmhouse. Already the thought had sparked in my brain, that I might stay there, eating his food and sleeping in his bed for weeks or months. Then I would not need to find out where I was, I would no longer be lost, for I would have a haven at his heart. To expedite my plan, while we trudged across the fields towards the farmhouse, I expressed far more interest in his NetWare than I really felt. He told me about his swift as well as his niddy Noddy. I thought he was suddenly talking about birds, but he corrected me after I mumbled something about limits. At one point, he hiked up his trouser cuffs and invited me to look at his socks. They were knit from the same batch of wool as the cardigan, he said. When we got to the farmhouse, I fell a little behind him as he approached the door. I saw a spade leaning against the wall, picked it up, and bashed his head in while he was still in the doorway. stepping over him, I went into the farmhouse kitchen and put the kettle on for a nice reviving Kappa. There was a woolly hat hanging from a nail on the back of the door. I knew I couldn't be completely mistaken about farmers hats. I took off my own hat and removed the farmer's woolly hat from the nail and put it on my head, a smaller and less florid head than the farmers adjusting it to a rakish angle. Knowing what I now knew about farmers NetWare I could tell it was knit from the same batch of wall as the cardigan and the socks. When the tea was brewed, I sat in the farmers chair drinking from the farmers tea cup. The swift and the niddy Noddy stood in the kitchen corner. The sun had set by now. And through the open doorway where the farmer's body light, I could either distant bellowing these cows in the black and starless night.

The painter Duff painter, was known as the painter of painters. This was not because he was considered the greatest of painters, nor that he was held in the highest of esteem by his fellow painters. Rather, he was dubbed the painter of painters, because of the single minded intensity of his vision. During his long career, dark painter, confined himself to one subject. All he ever painted with painters, that is, excuse me, all he ever painted was painters. That is the length of rope attached to the boughs of boats for tying them to the key side, or to bigger ships. painters paintings of painters were done in an incoherent jumble of styles, and he worked fast, often completing several paintings of painters in a single day. He might do an impressionistic daube in the morning, and expressionistic daube in the afternoon, and quite frankly, cack handed in pasto mulch in the evening. when one considers that he lived to the age of 90, and was active up to the very end, it comes as no surprise to learn that a complete catalogue raised on a piece of his output has yet to be compiled by not for want of trying. The art critic go dolphin Wiens has spent years devoting himself to the project, trying to track down every single painter painting every single painter painter painting and existence, photographing it with a Super duper high resolution camera, writing a brisk get captivating thousand word essay on it, and ranking it in order of both paint earliness and importance. So tireless and unstinting has Wiens been today he cuts a sorry figure sprawled on a municipal park bench in a dilapidated seaside resort, sweeping terps from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag. Now almost 90 himself. Wiens is no more than halfway through his mighty task. He has not yet for example, managed to locate the astonishing works of painters light period where he took the daubing paint directly onto painters. Many of these so called ropey paintings are probably attached to the boughs of boats tied to key sides or ships. And God alone knows where they are scattered upon the waterways of the world.

It's an exciting time in the world of breakfast. I learned as much as last week when I had the good fortune to be invited to a new product launch. The do took place in a swish and sophisticated hotel. And as I am neither squished nor sophisticated, I was a bit worried that I'd be thrown out on my ear. If indeed I was allowed in at all. I decided that I would cut something of a dash by wearing Spats. Unfortunately, my footwear advisor misconstrued what I said. And I arrived at the squishy and sophisticated hotel, wearing galoshes, but I need not a fretted sexual was the atmosphere of new breakfast products, excitement and hubbub that I made my way into the throng without incident. And what are thrown the hotel ballroom was Packed to the Rafters with the great and the good. The movers and shakers, the glitterati and Krishnan guru Murthy from Channel Four news. I grabbed a glass of aerated lettuce water from a tray held by a minion and leaned against a mantle piece in what I hoped was an insouciance manner. After a series of speeches from big names in the breakfast world, the new product was eventually revealed. Smokers Pop Tarts after we had udon odd the gorgeous packaging, we were treated to a demonstration of how best to prepare this to breakfast related snack item. Apparently, you remove the smokers pop tart from it greaseproof paper wrapping, pop it into a toaster. And wait. It was rather unfortunate that the toaster used at the launch was a 1972 model from the former Soviet Union, for it malfunctioned with a lot of buzzing and hissing noises before a billow of black smoke rose from it and tracked several celebrities standing nearby, one of whom I think may has been Yoko Ono. The smokers popped out itself was burned to ashes of course. By this time, we were all growing very peckish, and had been looking forward to munching this delicious new breakfast product. Instead, the hotel chef rustled up a vast quantity of bubble and squeak. It was rather like the miracle of the loaves and the fishes. Matthew chapter 14, verses 13 to 21. Mark chapter six verses 31 to 44. Luke chapter nine, verses 10 to 17 and john chapter six, verses five to 15, except with bubble and squeak, rather than bread and fish. By the time an umpire band started up, we were all stuffed to the gills, albeit not with smokers Pop Tarts, but we accepted our brochures, information sheets and balloons with good grace. And it was a reasonably happy crowd that spilled out into the hotel carpark. Interestingly, the car park was pitted with puzzles, oh puddles innumerable. And all were great and the good and the movers and the shakers and glitterati got their shoes and socks soaked through? I thank the Lord for my galoshes. And Krishnan guru Murthy. Thank the Lord for His galoshes thoughtfully provided by an unpaid intern from Channel Four news. As I went in my way home, through certain half deserted streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights in one night cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster shells. I resolved to buy a carton of smokers popped up for my breakfast at the earliest opportunity. Alas, I have yet to see them on the shelves of the local pop tart shop. As Jagger once observed, you can't always get what you want.

The end of this week's show. Thanks again, very thanks again to any burn for reading his travelogue. And I look forward to more of that. Couple of last things. This is a bit overdue. But you remember at the end of August was the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech. And the thing that struck me most forcefully comparing the footage of the original March and then the 2013 anniversary march was how much better dressed everybody was 50 years ago. I mean, did you see those scruffs on the on the current one terrible. And finally on a sadder note, I've been informed. Those of you who know that the the hooting yards theme music is the Caucasian lullaby by slap happy and Henry cow from their 1975 I think album, desperate straits. Apparently Lindsey Cooper died yesterday. Lindsey Cooper of course the bathroom and bathroom player and other instruments in them. Henry cow who'd been ill for many years I think. Anyway, very sadly she passed away yesterday. So as the show plays out today with the colocasia Nala by spare a thought for her and rest in peace. Bye bye
