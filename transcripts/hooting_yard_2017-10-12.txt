Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. This is hooting out on the air with me Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for about 28 and a half minutes while they're about the world famous food splattered Jesuit, was one of the best loved and most successful variety act of the interwar years. It is believed that he appeared to every single seaside resort in the land, the grandiose and the dilapidated in and out of season, and always to rapturous applause. Key to his appeal was sheer simplicity. The curtains would open and their onstage world famous and splattered with food, stood a Jesuit. He would extend his arms, almost in crucifixion pose, and gaze at a point slightly above the heads of the audience. There were no frills, no business with props. After a few minutes, the curtains would close and barring the inevitable uncle, that was that it was a winning formula. But one way GLS could not transfer to radio, where so many of the stars of variety theater went on to find fame and fortune. Throughout the years of his greatest popularity, roughly the decade from 1925 to 1935. The world famous food splatter, Jesuit managed miraculously, to preserve his anonymity. We still do not know for certain who he was. We do know, in spite of rumors put about to the contrary, that he was a single particular individual are not a series of different Jesuits. This charge was first leveled in a scurrilous newspaper story. In the daily Voodoo Dolly for the sixth of September 1929, a hacker named only as a seaside resort reporter claimed that the original world famous food splattered Jesuit, had been killed in an accident, picnic lightning, and replaced by at least seven other Jesuits, who took it in turns to repair at the end of piers splattered with food. This Farago of nonsense was comprehensively demolished by investigative variety theater reporter john Pilger, a man who knew his onions. But even pilled was not perfect, and it seems he was the source of a common misapprehension of the nature of the Jesuits performances. oft repeated by nincompoop wannabe historians of the seaside variety theater. This is the idea that the Jesuit stood on stage initially pristine in his su time, and that he was splattered with food by members of the audience, pelting him with eggs, fruit cuts of meat, soup, ketchup, and ad nauseum. So let me be crystal clear. There is not a shred of evidence that this was ever sold. More than that it belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire point of the Act. And the reason it was so wildly popular to wit, that the Jesuit simply stood there. Stockstill arms outstretched, faintly holy, world famous and food splattered. There was an art to these performances which we lose sight of in our modern fast moving age of papen twaddle. It will be a mistake to think that the Jesuit was nothing more than a messy eater with the table manners of Kapha who simply allowed various gains and spillages to accumulate upon his su time. Anybody could achieve that with persistence, determination, slapdash eating habits, and the shunning of laundry. In fact, there was for a time arrival act, known as the world famous bacon and egg besmirch none Though a woman of the though a woman of fine manners and terrific personal hygiene, she was bid doesn't bother you or of the end of the pier Limelight and dedicated herself to allowing much of her fried breakfast to fall upon her habit.

It was an effort of well not to send it straight to the laundry, but she gritted her teeth and prayed and took to the stage. In itself, hers was a fairly enchanting act as she knelt in an attitude of devotion, clutching her rosary beads, displaying her stains of egg yolk and bacon grease. But she was viewed with justification as a copycat, and audiences failed to warm to her. She later achieved a measure of success with a completely different act involving tea strainers, coat hangers and performing monkeys. The genius of the world famous food splattered Jesuit, on the other hand, was that the was that the splattering was carried out backstage immediately before each performance he would remove it to time, lay it out flat on the floor and proceed to splatter it with whatever foodstuffs came to hand. He would cook eggs or fruit attic from across the room. drizzle it with soup and broth and swaps and sauces and showered with bread and biscuit crumbs. Although there is no evidence that Jackson Pollock ever witnessed these preparations, it seems inconceivable to me that he could ever have arrived his action painting technique, without first having watched the world famous foods flattered Jesuit lather is common agreement that he was beyond all reasonable doubt a Jesuit and food splattered. Several Latter Day commentators have wondered about that world famous bit given that he is not known ever to have performed outside the seaside resorts of his own country by ask is there any truth in the claim that he was famed around the world? This was the interwar years. Remember, when communications were technologically primitive compared to our own era? How could a variety theater afficionado in far flung foreign parts ever hear tale of the goings on at the end of a rickety pier in an ounce of season seaside resort in our blessing land? It is a person in question, but it ignores the decisive role played in the world famous food splattered Jesuit career by his manager. Colonel Tom Emerson lichen Parker was a rogue and a rascal and an impresario of genius. It was he who first saw the potential of the bad press Stein black Sue time, saw it as a blank slate upon which food could be splattered, and then displayed as an a tableau vivaan to an adoring public. All he had to do he realized was to find the perfect Jesuit, first to do the food splattering bed to stand still with outstretched arms for 10 minutes or so. A policy side stage. By all accounts he searched for over six years before finding his man, a man whose name still remains a secret. And the first few appearances builders, the food splattered Jesuit, the Act was a flop. But rather than ditches choice of Jesuit, which we might easily have done, the colonel instead appro attended world famous tea stage nine. It was a stroke of genius. Crowd thronged to see a figure who was already they thought a legend. They were not disappointed as who could be. Certainly in today's entertainment saturated world, we fail to register just how impoverished we are. In the era of multi channel television and YouTube and a populace with the attention span of a gnat. We ought to be crying out in our millions for a variety act a spiritually enriching as the world famous food splattered Jesuit. Perhaps a young Tyrone graduate with a burning desire to entertain the masses is listening to this. If so he will know what to do.

Be it known that on the 14th day of the month of March in the year of pixelings last Mr. fab the on the secretary of the pointy town chapter of the Tuesday Weld fan club, hired to share a bank for the purposes of an excursion to outline parts of the old town of the said town. There's a picnic and exchange pictorial collector's cards of Tuesday. Well, her contemporaries and her peers that the driver of the Sherif bank was a man of frightful countenance and evil reputation, that he was said to have phantom limbs in addition to his given limbs, and that those these could not be perceived by the human eye in ordinary daylight. They were nevertheless present and said driver might be said to have the form of a gigantic spider, where he ever seen hole that the cost of the height of the shower bank and driver was met by subscription to the excursions and picnicking fund of the Tuesday Weld fan club, administered by the on treasurer, Mr. brimstone that Mr. Fogg and Mr. brimstone were at loggerheads by cause of imponderables and fathomless mysteries, known to none but they and their wives and their late Beatle Mr. flail perished of an au in the month of February passed that the remix of Mr. flail was confined to a madhouse wherein she did knit in a frenzy in all her hours of wakefulness that the shower bank driver by name bins, having agreed a route to the picnicking spot with Mr. fab did diverged his vehicle up into the hills, whence his intention was to deliver all the excursion in members of the Tuesday Weld fan club into the clutches of the grumpy man who dwelt in our lair in said hills, that bins was to gain no pecuniary advantage from this treachery in that his sole purpose was mystery for malfeasance. But the babblings of the excursionist within the Shire bank, excited them to such a degree, that none took cognizance of the divergence. That much frost and ice lay on the roads in that month of March, for it was a bitter season. But there was no grit to be had, nor were with all of pointy town civic gritting persons to spread it upon the roads. If there had been for the if there had been food, they were in dispute with regard to the start end, and held banners in a throne outside the Civic Hall and had tubs which they stamped with main force. That notwithstanding his great merit as a driver of the shower bag, bins cause the vehicle to skid ski score scoop off the appointed way and go plunging into a ditch some four miles as the crow flies past the bypass at blister lane that had bins taken the route agreed with Mr. fab such accident would never have occurred. That the gentlemen and ladies of the Tuesday Weld fan club conducted themselves with decency and aplomb that those who had been hurled from the sharer bank assisted those who remained within it twisted wreckage to make their escape. But they gathered in the ditch and sipped withdrew daintiness from flasks of soup piping hot that the on correspondence Secretary Mrs. Green tea distributed to all doctor good recipes famous and trustworthy brain powders for the alleviation of disorders of the nerves and integuments. That tears of emotion was shed when it was seen that Mr. Thorburn Mr brimstone, were putting aside their differences in the face of calamity and when shaking hands with each other with manly forbearance.

Plus a considerable time elapse before it was noted that the sharer bank driver bins was not present with the others in the ditch that said bins had taken to his heels at the first opportunity that his fleeing gained much expedition from the fact that his visible heels were accompanied by any number of Phantom heels, but that the direction of Benz's fleeing was into the hills, where he threw himself upon the mercy of the grumpy man with terrible bear wailings that he had failed in his appointed task. That the grumpy man excuse me, that the grumpy man was a stranger to mercy and grunted loud and all for grunts and dragged bins into the depths of his lair. That not hide nor hair of bins was ever seen again on this spinning Earth.

That the composure of the members of the Tuesday Weld fan club was a magnificent thing and a pride unto pointy town. That when wounds were bandage and shattered bones set with splints, like clambered for each and every one from the ditch to make the journey home on foot. That night fell, and they lost their way yet did not want screech in terror nor complain of kill. That they kept their spirits up by calling one to another the titles of feature films in which Tuesday Weld had appeared, to which another would respond by calling out the name of the character he had played in said feature film so that Mr. brimstone might call rally around the flag boys and Mrs. Green eco comfort, good pasture, or Mr. fabco. The Private Lives of Adam and Eve, and the on picnic secretary, Mrs. Blair's call in return vandrie Harper that such jollies were brought cruelly to a close when it happened in the darkness that Mr. thug collided with an enormous block of masonry and was knocked insensible that Mrs. diritti had exhausted her supply of Dr. Gillespie powders, but was able to revive Mr. Thorpe, with a draft of aqua blue side water from a canister within her handbag. That it was resolved to remain in the lead of the enormous block of masonry pending the break of dawn, for it provided some shelter from a wild wind which now was roaring. That's to pass the time until dawn, the excursionist hummed tunes made famous by Dudley Moore and pink acid Zuckerman respectively, the second and third husbands of Tuesday Weld. But when dawn came and examination was made of the masonry, it was found to be covered in greatly mysterious inscriptions in an alphabet unknown to even the most erudite member of the Tuesday world fanclub that this was by common acclaim Mr. Sham Beco, who was the author of many learned books, among them being a history of pointy town, a topographical description of the area around the Ballista lane bypass and a shot by shot analysis of the feature film. I'll take Sweden, in which Tuesday Weld appeared as the character Jojo Holcomb flattened scraping chunks of mud from the masonry the better to view the inscriptions, it became apparent that much of the block remained submerged below the ground that Mrs. Green tea produced from her handbag, a number of gardening trials, which he carried on the aborted excursion, in case within the vicinity of the picnic spot had grown such plants as campion's and hellebore and lupins for the digging up and transplanting her garden behind the house on turpentine Boulevard in pointy town. That those of the party not yet faint with exhaustion, set to with a will a crowding away the mud to reveal as much of the enormous block of masonry as their efforts might allow. That thus was discovery made of The ancient tomb of anax agrotech that Mr. Sham Beco thereafter wrote an account of the discovery and embarked upon an extensive lecture tour of many countries that Mr. Sham Beco never failed to acknowledge the inadvertent part played by the evil spidery Shera bank driver bins.

That it remains unknown who or what and x or Grote X was or is or in what era he lived if ever he lived at all, that his tomb now gleaming is surrounded by a fence to deter souvenir hunters. And that propped against the tube in a plain wooden frame, coated with protection against the elements is a publicity photograph of Tuesday Weld, taken circa 1963, during production of the feature film sold soldiers in the rain, in which she appeared as the character Bobby Jo pepper died. That is apt that a soldier stands guard in a century box beside the tomb of an actor grow tax, and it is raining and that there is no roof upon the box. So the rain falls directly upon the soldier who's bad declares his name as private Pepperdine.

I was reading that it occurred to me that the prose style was clearly clearly influenced by Norman Davis. We all I hope all of my listeners are familiar with Norman Davis, author of further science book 20 which was published in 2001. And in the capital of I've got a couple of minutes. I'll read you a bit of Norman Davis because he does this kind of thing far better than I do.
