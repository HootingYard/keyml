resonance 104 point four FM, the yard of hooting. Yes, it's hooting out on the air with me, Frank key live from London. Or perhaps you're listening on a podcast at some point in the future? Who knows? Anyway, I have been very remissed because for the last two weeks on this show, I have completely forgotten to mention, possibly the greatest news story of the last, I don't know, decade, half century century. At least I think I have. I don't think I've mentioned it. There was a headline a few weeks ago that I came across, and it was simply five words. But the greatest five words in any headline I've ever seen. porpoises rescue, Dick Van Dyke. And apparently what happened was Dick Van Dyke. 85 years old, if he's a day was out on his surfboard. What is that about? Anyways, Dec was out off the coast of California is surfing on his surfboard, and he fell asleep. And he when he woke up he had drifted far from shore. But imperiled as he was friendly porpoises, according to the new story, came along came up and pushed him to shore. Isn't that a fantastic story? I think there's there's a there's a film to be made or a musical perhaps, or something. Anyway. porpoises rescue Dick Van Dyke? marvelous. It's a very rich man dig Van Dyck, because he had his initials trademarked. And now every time anywhere in the world, a DVD is sold. He gets 15 cents for each one. Is that true? I don't know. Anyway, onwards with the show. If you can get the image of porpoises pushing big Van Dyck to show out of your head, I can't. I'm on with the show. Borrowing through the dust caked and tottering piles in old pal dust cakes, secondhand bookshop the other day. I was delighted to light upon a copy of pebble heads. absurdly precocious autobiography, I pebble head, published when he was still wet behind the ears. Excuse me. Excuse me, published when he was still wet behind the ears. It was his first best selling paperback. The fact that he was completely unknown to the world when he wrote it, and had lived so short an event for life up to that point makes it's astounding success, all the more bewildering. The prose is callow clunky, and at times incoherent. The narrative devoid of incident save for the famous hydroelectric power station picnic explosion, disaster and its aftermath. To return entire lengthy chapter is devoted. Yet the presses kept rolling, as more and more copies had to be printed. To satisfy the public's seemingly hysterical demand for the book. One observer calculated that more copies were sold than there are stars in the heavens. That being so one might think it would be an easy title to track down in shops such as old pal dust cakes, even so many years after publication, but one hardly ever sees a copy for sale. One explanation which I find quite convincing, is that a flaw in the binding cause the majority of the books to fall apart when touched by human skin. Luckily, when I was rummaging in the shop, I was wearing my sinister black mittens simply to strike a pose you understand

When keeping a tally of gnomes it's important to be aware of the different varieties, including newly discovered types of gnome. It's all very well being able to spot for example, well known knowns, such as garden gnomes, the gnomes of Zurich and Rudolf steiners curiously disturbing, invisible knowns. But what will it profit man if it tallies up some types of known but overlooked others entirely. Consider for example, the exhausted pipe cleaner knowns mentioned in passing on page 149 of Kate Atkinson's new novel started early took my dog. To the best of my knowledge these busy retinal fellows have not previously been recorded in any authoritative list of known types. Now they have been brought to light However, it's clear that one must keep an eye out for them when conducting a known Tally. Miss Atkinson has little to say about them although she does not she does notice their propensity for drunkenness. We should not be surprised that this for it doesn't take much to intoxicated gnome. And we can hardly begrudge these gnomes their pots of foaming Norwegian lager after a hard day's pipe cleaning. Even though you're not a gnome, I expect you to would be exhausted if you were up at the crack of dawn armed with a scrubbing brush and a bucket of bleach off to clean pipes until nightfall. gnomes are particularly suited to cleaning duties of course, even when suffering from hangovers as they usually are. Yet somehow in his magisterial survey of common gnome occupations botsman omits the pipe cleaner gnomes jumping in his alphabetical list from oil rig janitor gnomes directly to potting shed snack preparation gnomes. From this we can conclude that the exhausted pipe cleaner gnomes have deliberately concealed their existence from the wider world more successfully even then Rudolf steiners creepy invisible gnomes, which is saying something. The alternative is that botsman failed to notice them, which would mean that his survey is not as magisterial as we have been led to believe. Frankly, that doesn't bear thinking about. One thing we learned from any half competent known tally is that calling blots man's expertise into question unleashes those terrible terrible botsman reputation protection gnomes with their sharpened pins and hallucinatory facial expressions. For those of you unfamiliar with Rudolf steiners, invisible gnomes, here is an extract from his book Theosophy an introduction to the super sensible knowledge of the world and the destination of man, published exactly 100 years ago. And in this piece of twaddle, Rudolf Steiner writes, the spiritual outlook, in fact, is through the spirit of the age, the Zeitgeist extended over a variety of other beings, both lower and higher, who live in the environment of man, without his being able to perceive them with his bodily senses. But those who have powers of spiritual sight, perceive such beings and can describe them to the lower kind belong those designated by the spiritual investigator as salamanders, selves, undines, and knowns. It is quite to be understood that anyone who is inclined to admit the validity of physical vision only regard such beings as the offspring of a wild hallucination and superstition. They can of course, never become visible to the physical eye, for they have no physical bodies. The superstition does not consist in regarding such beings as real, but in believing that they appear in a way perceptible to the physical senses. beings with such forms cooperate in the building of the world, and one comes into connection with them, as soon as one enters the higher regions closed to the bodily senses. So there you go, according to Rudolf Steiner, if you enter the higher rate You will come face to face with an invisible gnome.

I was looking at some diagrams of the human head. And I was, I was infuriated to learn that the sight of one's disability sociality is located so precisely low down at the back of the head. This makes it extremely difficult to deal with when one eventually gather sufficient courage, moral and physical to do something about it. Whether one intends to tweak it with tweezers, modify it with blows from a hammer, or wrench it out entirely with a pair of pliers, its position make any approach fraught with difficulties, difficulties which may prove insuperable to the suffer from the ability socl in particular. Why on earth did God make us in so cack handed a manner an array of mirrors precisely angled will go some way to helping us. But mirror reflections can be notoriously misleading, particularly to those who are optically stupid reflections and reflections of reflections and reflections of reflections of reflections and so forth. Depending upon the number of mirrors in one's array can baffle the brightest. And it's not the brightest we're talking about here. Add to that the dexterity required to deploy one's tweezers or hammer or pliers at the back of one's bonds without doing oneself a mystery. And one can appreciate how perilous the process is certain to be. What was the Lord thinking. And alternative, of course, is to accept one's debilitate socl for what it is and carry on regardless. But they're in like even greater disasters with one thing and another to all intents and purposes. Speaking in the round, as my old father confessor used to say, or rather whisper lugubriously in his box after mass when the weight of my sins grew too much to bear. And I went to see him for absolution. And for tips on the proper usage of tweezers and hammers and pliers. Which being that rare thing a practical priest he was ever happy to divulge or be it with equally goob spirit and matter was one to him. He had not the Marist Tink to debilitate socl. At least I do not think he did. But then I can't recall ever seeing the back of his head.

I'd like to begin with a quotation. This way I'd like to begin this piece not the program programs already been going. We're about halfway through In fact, to me anyway, excuse me. Okay, I'd like to begin this piece with a quotation. And it's a call for papers for a special section in the journal urban history on the history of urban house numbering. Street addressing is one of the most basic strategies employed by governmental authorities to tax police manage and monitor the spatial whereabouts of individuals within a population. Despite the central importance of the street address as a political technology that sometimes met with resistance, few scholars have examined the historical practice of street addressing with respect to its broader social and political implications. were particularly interested in showcasing recent work that links the history of urban house numbering to broader debates concerning the interrelations of space, knowledge and power that have animated contemporary discussions in the social sciences and humanities. It's quite astonishing that they said discussions instead of discourses anyway. In his days as an armchair revolutionary, Blodgett became peculiarly exercised about urban house numbering. He lived at the time that six Rolf Harris mew. Most views are plural, but this one wasn't. There were nine Buju little dwellings in the mew. And with what bloodroot identified as a typically had demonic capitalist patriarchal, linear system of oppression. They were numbered consecutively from one to nine. Blodgett had to subject this system to a rigorous post structuralist interrogation, before he was in a position to subvert it. And this he did, strolling up and down the moon, making notes accompanied by impossibly complicated diagrams in his trotting pad. across the way, crippled mendicants brought to such a state of destitution that they will lower even than the lowest of the lumpen proletariat wallowed in their own filth and wailed for crumbs. Blodgett occasionally went over to consult with these wrenches, garnering their views on his important research. His first step in defiance of an unconscionable tyranny will stand up and his door number said that it looked like a nine rather than a six. For this blow against the system, he was shouted at by the posty and beaten incentive or with a club by the occupant of number nine. Blodgett had of course expected violence as the response to his supremely transgressive act. But he asked himself, as he lay bandaged in a clinic was it transgressive enough. When he was well enough to return home, he stole out one night and using a screwdriver, remove the door number from each house in the moon, he made a pile of them and set them ablaze. Using an oil soaked rag liberated from one of the mendicants. by the light of the fire, he took a paint pot and dogged upon each door, a slogan of resistance. For this, he was again shouted at by the post II and again beaten in centerbore by the occupant of number nine, a person laboring under false consciousness, who was joined on this occasion by three or four of the neighbors. This time, upon his discharge from the clinic, Blodgett discover that all trace of his door beings had been raised, and brand new metal numbers are fixed to the doors, except his own, which now had nailed to it in a clear plastic bag as protection from the incessant rainfall and notice from the Civic authorities. Blodgett sat on the stoop to read it. In essence, it told him that he was a fat head and an idiot.

Poor Blodgett. For a while it looked as if he might be homeless, and have to join the wretched intervention across the way. But then he had one of his magnificent blog, jetty and brainwaves. He scampered off to the Civic authorities oppressive brutalist headquarters and explained to an official that he was an artist. This declaration did the trick. He was welcomed back to Rolf Harris mew as a returning prodigal even by the bourgeois scammer number nine, and he resumed his activities, talking twaddle to power.

Here is an extract from a sermon. No sorry, from a book about sermons and such matters by john eat chard, the grounds and occasions of the contempt of the clergy and religion, published in 1670. It seems also not very easy for a man in his sermon to learn his parishioners, how to dissolve gold, of what and how the stuff is made. Now, to ring the bells and call the people on purpose together would be better blunt business, but to do it neatly, and when nobody looked for it. That's the rarity and art of it. Suppose then, that he takes these texts that have sent Matthew Repent ye The kingdom of God is at hand. Now tell me to do you not perceive the gold to be in a dismal fear to curl and quiver at the first reading of these words, it must come in us, the blocks and blocks of our sins must be taken out by the Aqua Fortis of our tears, to which Aqua forces if you put a fifth part of Salah moniak and set them in a gentle heat, it makes aqua regia which dissolves gold, and now test out wonderful of the things that are to be done by the help of metaphors and similitudes. And I'll undertake that with a little more pains in consideration. Out of the very same words, he could have taught the people how to make custards, marmalade autist, two prunes.

The slacker Georgia dribbler drooled as he danced. In spite of his dribbling and drooling, he executed as fine a waltz as any man alive. his partner's face ladies prone to fits of the vapors, learned to wear protective shawls of plastic or rubber to parry the drool. It was viscous draw dribbled from his slack jaw. We do not have time here to delve into his innards and their startling chemistry to explain the equally startling viscosity of his drool. Suffice to say he had been studied by boffins, who found him fascinating, though they cared not a jot vaes waltzing but perhaps they ought to have cared and investigated, for it may be that there was a link unsuspected, but adamantine between his anomalous innards and his terpsichorean talent. Because of his drooling the slack, George dribbler was a man of few words. It was said that he expressed himself more fully in the waltz than he could ever manage with words. When he spoke, he slurred and slurped and his eyes grew wild. The failure ladies shattered or swooned and who can blame them. It is also true that he had no conversation of the kind suitable for tea dances and soirees. He had fixed views on two or three topics of limited interest. And these he expanded so far as his drooling and slurring and slurping aloud in a low monotone, indistinguishable at times from the bars of a distant swarm of Hornets. And Hornets were indeed one of his topics of interest, along with taxa demised clovers, and steam power. He was learned, but limited in his learning, as if mighty ramparts of concrete surrounded his mind. This too, may have been connected to the curious chemical reactions within his innards. It does nothing to explain his waltzing, which was a wonder. He haunted the drawing rooms I myself haunted for a decade or more. I always stood on the other side of the room, peering at him through my binoculars from the shadows. I studied him as one might study a blue bottle fly, or one of the worms. But before I could reach any conclusions, one afternoon he was no longer to be seen dancing so elegantly across the park a, he was gone, and nobody ever spoke of him. The fe ladies took up with other dancing partners, men with medals and mustaches, who did not draw. I had neither medals nor a mustache. I had just my binoculars, and with the slack George dribble a gun. I trained them upon other subjects, but I train them in vain. For by now, the lenses were cracked and smudged, and all I saw was blurs. Then they ejected me from the drawing rooms and barred me for the future. I sought the slack George dribbler high and low mon Sen. blob, more Freyr but I never tracked him to his layer. I made my own layer in office. Horrible cave on here off day.

That's nearly the end of this week's show. I want to remind you that Christmas gifts for your nearest and dearest and even more distant friends and relations. Your Christmas gift ought to be a copy of impugned by a peasant and other stories. My latest paperback, go to the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org, click on the picture of the cover, follow the link and go buy the book. It's only available online. If you don't want to buy the book, you could always take out a subscription to the website or make a donation every little helps. And yes, I've said enough about that. Anyway. Recently, I've probably or not recently, but at some point in the past on this show, I have read a couple of fantastic damning, contemporary book reviews of Ulysses by James Joyce. Here are four contemporary reviews of Oscar Wilde, the Picture of Dorian Gray. First, the Scots observer. If Mr. Wilde can write for none but outlawed nobleman and perverted telegraph boys, the sooner he takes a tailoring or some other decent trade, the better for his own reputation and the public's morals. The Daily Chronicle said of the Picture of Dorian Gray. This is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French decadence, a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with mythic odors of moral and spiritual Patra faction. The Athenaeum on the other hand, said the book is unmanly, sickening, vicious and tedious. And someone who signed himself as paterfamilias in the journal up lift wrote, I would rather give my daughter a dose of Pratik acid then allow her to read this book. So there you go. They want that I hope they won't say that about impugned by a peasant and other stories. Because that's not remotely sickening, unmanly vicious or tedious. Even though I say to myself, okay, end of this week show. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
