Got the microphone in the right place. Okay, where you just heard some Beatles White Album outtakes. So that was a hooting yard outtake? Yes, it's hunting yard on the air. The show previously known as a general air of decrepitude. My name is Frankie and despite being decrepit on here in the studio, behind the mic, and we're going to talk about poultry today. In 1946, George Louis Borges, the great Argentinian writer, was appointed as chief poultry inspector for the Buenos Aires poultry market, or it may even have been a bigger market than that. And he immediately resigned. So his tenure didn't last long as poultry Inspector, but of course, he wasn't the first blind person to be appointed an inspector of poultry. We're all we recall the case of pimp T two decades earlier, and far, far from when Azeris it may be an exaggeration to dump him as the pebble head in the title of his best selling paperback biography, the illustrious Pym T, but that there was a must about him cannot be denied unless he wants to start a punch up. Pin to blind This was more blankety than Miltonic. He was the sort of man who enraged cows when he trespassed in their fields that weekend, carrying a picnic basket under a thunderous sky. escaping the poultry market. With it, tin roofs and yelling merchants is prison in the week, the inspectors heart

the Braille calendar hanging Tat, tattered from a nail, and the nail rusted, pricking him if he wasn't careful, blood on his fingers, as his hands fumbled, delving into a hen's croup, prodding, inspecting, as he was paid to do. Our more than generously he got a fair whack, and he spent it on booze and floozies by haunted the poultry market. Like figures from an early and Ludvig kitchen a painting Gordy Angular themselves sozzled on bathtub gin. Sometimes they cracked clucked just like hens, particularly in the early afternoon, poor pimpy fuddled, but up to his duty tape measure around his neck like a tailor shifting matter. God knows why. It wasn't his job to measure the hands nor their eggs. They drugged he thought it was some kind of loose cravat, and if being blind, he wouldn't know. They should have learned from their failed tricks. Those mischievous Poulter is shoving a ball of dough stuck with feathers on the inspectors table. his rage was as terrible as the cows when he opened the gate of the field with one hand, holding tight to the picnic basket with the other out in the midst, oblivious of it, but not of the cows that bore down on him on Saturdays and Sundays when the poultry market was closed, shuttered a deserted patch of concrete and cement. stray feathers scattered neglected by the janitors broom, the janitor pimp tease pow, some said his half brother, Deaf as a post when the inspector was blind. They made quite a pair even without the blood tie. Always playing card games at lunchtime, Romijn spiked and my ladies bonnet and creases, no money ever changing hands, the table rickety sawdust everywhere. The stove in the corner, rain on the roof, birds packing grain from the floor, shadow in the hot door of the inspector of inspectors looming. Come for the rent and a crack up pente defiant spitting out his words. Has standing all in does if he'd seen a ghost, half these hens are sick man. What do you expect me to do? Have a total qinhuai tally my Ledger's, I have to go and have a word with a man about a buffalo being done on a duck bill. And off pimped he goes weaving across the familiar yard sniffing the air. A storm brewing. Better put on his Southwestern yellow was a duck in a nursery book, shiny cardboard pages. Stiff buckled here and there, as you'd expect. He remembered gazing and gazing wrapped, while still so tiny with eyes that worked before the operation. The surgeon cutting the useless withered nerves and then the blur. Black, the new life. The hard study the poultry inspection board subject easy examination. What's this? What's that? This is sir and that is that sir, and a badge for merit. He still wears it polishes it and buffs it daily after breakfast tickers or bloated, Schoenberg, cassette, transfigured night, day two thinks pimpy, day two, transfigured and transformed weekday poultry market and we can pick Nick, when he gets out, humming as he approaches the gate in the field, beyond which angry cows are waiting, and he pacifies them sweet nothings by the same.

Try the same thing on the hands, and three would be mayhem. That much he discovered one awful first day. It was raining men too, and his slit he slips on straw or grease and cashes leg. You won't find a better Turner cave on a tape measure, Believe you me Still, there was much blood spilled before it was taught pimp t Gore, like a rare expensive wine, metallic bouquet and something in it irresistible. The ducks, dozens of them falling upon it like starlings splashing about in his blood. The inspector deafened by clucking thinking, I better find out exactly what it is in my veins. I might be a miracle of medical science, who would have thought it hens maddened by the blood splatter ducks shrieking tangles and then the sirens from the emergency service adding the sirens for an emergency services and you have complete havoc but pimpy back at the poultry market next morning behind this table, sticking his fingers off a duck's fundament the sense of touch honoring even though the rubber glove bright yellow like the rain hat, like the ducks in the nursery book so much yellow it was Pierre Bala who said you can never have enough yellow, no more yellow for pimpy but the yellow in his brain remembered yellow bright enough when the stains

and the strains the sign apses you can almost hear them ping and Tang if he listened carefully and pimpy does. He's all ears. That's why he hears the enraged cows in the field even before they're enraged. Before his thumb clicks open the gate on picnic days in sunshine or mist or once when his watch stopped in the middle of the night. high wind Katelyn slumber owls hooting empty with his roghan hamper. Jam sandwiches fish paste Coco, a drowned beetle in the flask. The janitor never joins him grab the janitor. He goes instead on organized picnics for the hard of hearing to the grounds of castles and stately homes. Not cow strewn field. Always in daylight, like pimped he doesn't see and hasn't seen for years. But he misses a sentence it on his eternally closed lids heat and cold, damp and haze. He no longer bothers with the sunglasses he used to sport frames too heavy on the nose. He smashed them under foot in a temper trunk to hell at the time swigging as he smashed the poultry market but off duty on a Tuesday afternoon, with a floozy on his arm. giggling egging him on a bit batty if truth be told, or Dottie, that's the word fond of the poultry to fund baby in an unseemly way. kept trying to abduct a hen or a duck or a goose. Take it home as a pet. I'll go on empty nobody will miss it. I can call it Flopsy or Clyde maestra and make a pond for it in my bathtub, feed it grain or whatever it eats. Another grain supplier, a man with a silo, oh pretty pleased. But for all he was drawn to grandiose to bought pimped he was as conscientious of poultry inspector as the market ever had any foiled her kidnaps every one of them using his luster, really quite mysterious, but absolutely effective going by results. The inspector of inspectors always had a good word for him back at headquarters. That man PMT is a bloody Marvel. Never a day goes by that is poultry inspections are a master class in the art, even when he sozzled there's alabaster about him that makes my jaw drop. pimpy never heard any of this. I never been invited into a GQ. Not even to the cocktail parties. stuffy bunch and him shall we say difficult, haphazard in certain settings, viable to break things, jugs, plates, toasters, he was a devil with toasters rarely invited anywhere, hence, the lonely picnics, pimped in a field beneath the enormous sky. placating angry cows sprawled on his rug away from the poultry. Maybe that was when he worked his luster. It was as if he emitted raise no machine unearthly when he chose to switch it on, which he certainly did when pebble head came calling. he'd heard rumors bustled into the poultry market first thing Monday morning in a cape and spat entourage of bodyguards. So where's this blind inspector I've been hearing about Tell me dammit, I have a paperback to write. Ah, good day to you, sir. Gosh, pebble head dumbstruck, slumps in a chair and assistant takes notes, pimply all the while inspecting geese and hens and ducks, even a swan. He bubbles up during even a swarm meet. He doubles up on rubber gloves, uses some sort of been strange miniature tort works its control so so definitely, but the swan is dead. They prosecute the merchant, huge pile of legal papers, even bigger pile of Braille for pimpy. big thick sheets, untold thousands of dots. He knows the whole thing backwards. Fantastic witness visits the swan killer in prison, dank sell those smoking, repent, repent, but we can never have you back at the poultry market. You crossed the line and I drew that line. Yes. And it's indelible. Like all my lines, wherever I draw them.

He's babbling pimpy making it up as he goes along to strike the fear of God into the convict before he shipped away over the sea to a penal colony. One specially built for bird killers, Rocky and remote blasted by gales, screeching gold orcs, guillemots, Sky, cold and gray and hopeless place of penitence. prising barnacles from stone for food, all in pintas. Mind vengeful, eaten away with hatred, teaming visions, the hand in the brain. Oh, yes, lustrous pebble head saw that. But he had no idea of pimpy in the round the whole man, duck Messiah, goose god, it's certainly worth reading the biography seemed to be a film. But much of what pebble had writes is nonsense. For one thing, pimpy looked absolutely nothing like Anthony Burgess.

And most of that was one sentence. So I'm a bit out of breath. But I hope you enjoyed it. And it has nothing to do with Borchers, although he was indeed very, very briefly. The poultry inspector of Brenna's Aires I think they appointed him to the poster. Stop him writing or something. Talking of stopping writing, I haven't written anything for ages. I don't know what's wrong with my brain. But that doesn't mean that hooting out the website is idle. And since last week, or since the first since Saturday. If that was like a phone call. You'd like doing that correctly. It's the annual hooting yard advent calendar. And this year. Last year we have no event calendar of intertitles from guy Maddin films, which I enjoyed, but I don't think anyone else did. This year's theme is milk. So so far, we've had six photographs, and or film stills, featuring glasses of milk. I don't think we've had any bottles. Oh, yeah, we have bottles of milk in one picture. But anyway, up until Christmas day, every day there will be a picture of milk in a glass or a bottle or who knows what else might turn up. And it's the hooting out Advent cameras. So the idea is that you, you print out the page, cut out the picture and stick it on a piece of cardboard and put it on your mantel piece. If you haven't got a mantel piece, you can just leave it leaning against the wall in your home. Thank you very much.

Continuing with our theme of poetry for today's show, The Times had a report about a party thrown by the Princess Royal in 1789. Not a good year for Royals. Well not in France. Suppose it was okay in this country. Anyway, the Princess Royal had a party. And I quote, that part of the supper which was hot, consisted of 20 careens of different soups, roast duck, Turkey, poultry, signet, green geese, large rails, chickens, asparagus, peas, and beans. The cold parts of the collation were the same kinds of poultry. boned and swimming or standing in the center of transparent jammies, wherever they were supported by paste pillows, not in circumference, thicker than a knitting needle. This with the lights playing from the candles and reflected on and reflected on by the Polish of the plates and dishes made the most beautiful appearance. crayfish pies of all kinds were distributed with great taste, and the hands and brown hands and brawn in masquerade, swimming on the surface of pedestals of jelly, seemingly supported, but by the strength of an apparent or liquid called for admiration.

Sorry, where am I? We take us our text for today sermon. The Gospel of Matthew, chapter 10. Verse 29 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father. Sometimes it so happens that you'll go to a sparrow seller to make purchase of a pair of sparrows, only for him to state an asking price of more than a farthing or he might charge a farthing for a single Sparrow. But throw in a second Sparrow with a buy one get one free offer, in which case, you will pay a farming for two sparrows, even if the one Sparrow costs to farming in itself. There again, you might find yourself being offered a free Sparrow buyer seller of say partridges or limit who has an unwanted stock of sparrows, and cannot wait to be rid of them for they are generally for that group. Eating up his grain and millet that he would rather feed to his partridges, or he's in it. So when we ask the question, as we must, are not two sparrows sold for farming? The answer is no, not always. Not in all circumstances Come what may, for there may be times and places where we will be asked to pay more or less for a pair of sparrows. And from this we can learn much about the ways of God and man. Yes, the honest Sparrow seller will hand us to sparrows upon receipt of a falling, but not all Sparrow sellers are honest. While some Sparrow sellers are too honest, for their own good, and as with Sparrow sellers, so to those from whom we buy other birds, not just partridges and linnet, but starlings and kitty white, and seagulls. But what are the second part of the verse from Matthew 10, that one of them that is the sparrows, that one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father? The first part of the verse is a question. The second part is not it states quite vehemently, and unchangeably, that without your father, one of the sparrows will not fall on the ground. But whichever the sparrows is it that shall not fall, one of them will, and one of them will remain in the air in flight and birdie swooping until your father appears, at which point we must assume if it will plunge towards the earth, just because your father has arrived. The more one studies this passage, and I have studied it for years and years, the more problems it raises. Why does one Sparrow fall to the ground without your father? Why does the other Sparrow fall on the ground when your father appears? Is your father armed with a shotgun or a catapult? Does his mere presence in druce in the tiny frail Sparrow a heart attack? And if he can have that effect on a sparrow, one of other birds, partridges say, or linnets, or starlings or kittiwakes, or seagulls or Robbins, or Rennes, or even hummingbirds? These are profound questions and we must dig deep to answer them deeper certainly, that a sparrow may need to dig to light upon a fat juicy earthworm for its morning snack. My own experience has taught me that all that digging will be as not unless one has first found a sparrow seller to sell one a pair of sparrows for a fathering I've asked in this day and age more lead than than golden. Such Sparrow sellers are rare indeed rarer even than the proverbial hen's teeth. But the hen is quite another class of bird from a sparrow. As you will know, if you've ever studied poultry, Thus saith the Lord.

I bring the news now. Well news, the two year old news from December 2016. On the BBC, I was told two years ago, I was told on the news that chickens have to be kept indoors to create a bird flu free zone is a government tricking directive that you have to keep these chickens indoors until further notice. And it prompted a little song that we can all sing as we round up our chickens if we have any. And I'd like to sing this song that now. And with a bit of luck, I'll be joined by pansy cradle Jew because we do very good harmony singing. Well, I'd like to think so. So we're gonna sing this little song 1234 bring your chickens in the poultry week, prop your chicken on the couch and Patton's little beak. Anyway, that's what you don't. He can sing that while you bring your chickens indoors. And apparently, I know this is two years ago, but we should also be on the lookout for dead or debilitated swans and report any sightings to the police. I'm sure the police will be quite happy. You won't be white on any micro train for reporting hate crimes on Twitter. You can say, Officer officer quick, I've seen a debilitated Swan and the officer will probably turn around and say, Don't waste my time I'm in I'm investigating the the insult of a non binary person on a tweet in a tweet. To which you should say but officer surely a debilitated Swan is more important. And you need to then take it up with the Chief Inspector, but not the inspector or poultry we were hearing about. I actually really don't know what I'm saying at this stage. So I'm just making things up to get through the final closing moments of hooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. Thank you to pansy for singing along on the keep your poultry in keep your clicking indoors song thanks to john for engineering and producing the show as ever. And I think that's about it is there much time left? This three minutes and let me see if I can find something very brief to read to you. I might be able to or pansy may have some knitting advice or poultry advice of some kind. I don't know. Let's see if I can find something.

I've got something here called poultry menace day one. But I think that's going to take longer than three minutes or probably now. A minute and a half. Okay, well, that leads me to recommend some reading to you. It's a pamphlet by George Ascot, and it's called the art of faking exhibition poetry, an examination of the fakers methods and processes with some observations on their detection. And it's a very good pamphlet published by T Verna Laurie limited. Gotham house, water lane, London EC four. And yes, it's all about the art of faking exhibition toll free. So saving, get a copy of that from a secondhand dealer, and I'll be back next week with even more about poultry or perhaps about something else. I don't know. Bye bye.
