hog the sound of barking the sound of dogs. It is an unclean sound for dogs are unclean, as are such beasts as pigs and lobsters. According to my well thought out worldview. I was taught early to shun dogs and pigs and lobsters to flee from their presence. If they did not first flee from mine. Without the fleeing, there's all mine. I would become contaminated by their uncleanness and need to wash and wash and wash with water and soap and borax and purifiers until my flesh was raw, and all trace of dog pig lobster was wholly eradicated even down to the tiniest speck of filth. For filth It is so I know for it is written. I first fled from a dog or it may have been a pig or a lobster. When I was so tiny I barely remember and have pieced together the event as best I can. By repeated an indefatigable questioning of bolg Horvath, the family wizard. I fled and plunged into a pond screaming and soap and borax and purifiers were tossed into me by the cleansing monkey from it booth and then to the pond. I tried water and rubbed and scrubbed and eventually clambered out of the pond and ran home there to burn a corn Dolly and make a paste of the ash and just smear the pay stub on my forehead and remains so marked until we're setting of the sun as it is written. That was so long, long ago. And in the years since there have been many other ponds and cleansing monkey booths, and corn dollies burned to ash for the world is filled to bursting with dogs and pigs and lobsters like cannot always be avoided. In the run of a de bourgh. Horvath, the family wizard explained to me that the unclean must coexist with the clean to teach us. If dogs and pigs and lobsters were obliterated from the face of the planet, or even laughably, deemed to be clean, as they are by some among the damned, then the litanies we'd learn would lose all sense, and that surely cannot be. I know when I see the stain upon my forehead and our Looking Glass, that I am righteous, at least until nightfall, and that any further dog or pig or lobster come roaming into my zone of cleanse that day will be repelled as if by great force for so it is written bogg Horvath, the family wizard has been most helpful in clarifying the status of apes and monkeys. Some are clean as obviously other cleansing monkeys in their booths by ponds and mirrors and lakes, but others are unclean creatures of filth to be shunned. When I was still a child, my mom and Parr had not properly grasped what bog Horvath, the family wizard was teaching, and they brought into the house as a pet an unclean ape. I cannot remember what kind exactly, it was not sufficient. Then just to burn a corn Dolly. The house itself had to burn with the eight pin my mom and pop inside it. While bog Horvath, the family wizard and I stood outside on the path beside the clump, avec and the lupins watching the purifying flames raw.

When all was ash, he took me away with him to the Mad Rasta or School, where he taught me through a combination of magic incantations, brain probes and a pointy stick, how to cherish all that is clean and to despise all that is unclean, and to know which is which. That is why today grown aged and tall with my huge untidy beard and thrice bleached tunic, when I Hark to the barking of approach Dogs I fear them not, nor the grunting of approaching pigs, nor the clacking of approaching lobsters. I wait until they are close enough to be seen. If they are large and fierce and terrific, I flee. If tinier, and timid, I stand my ground. And as I was taught many moons ago by bog Horvath, the family wizard, and as it is written, I cow them the dogs or pigs or lobsters by jumping up and down, as if equipped with a trampoline, and I flail my arms in the air like a wild thing, and I scream my head off. And then they flee for me, these filthy unclean beast, be they dogs or pigs or lobsters or certain apes and monkeys, that is the righteous way, you will not see the damned behave so that is why they are damned to flames and perdition and to be eternally poked at with the pointy stick of the Supreme, the magnificent bog.

That was Thought for the Day and now we can continue with hooting yard on the air. My name is Frankie, and I'm gonna read to you for the remainder of the half hour that wasn't taken up with those religious and very spiritual thoughts. And this is a variation on a theme of scott walker. His mother called him Ivan, then she died. His name was actually Dennis, but his mother was in the throes of death rattle delirium, and she mistook him for the priest father, Ivan Plunkett, who had been at her bedside but a moment ago. He had popped out to rinse his rosary beads under a spigot because they were caked with muck. One does not often see a priest carrying a set of filthy rosary beads. But father Ivan Plunkett parish round took him to many farmyards and barnyard and through many puddles and ditches. Dennis's mother's was not the only death he witnessed that day. at certain times of year, there is much slaughter on farms, much much slaughter, and this was one of those times. Father Ivan Plunkett rent the Mac from his rosary beads. I need to have them steeped in the blood of a hen before an hour had passed. He rinsed that blood away to into a farmyard gutter and he did not weep. Back at the house, Denis sat looking at his mother in her winding sheet. He was perplexed that she had caught him Ivan, for he had not put two and two together. He was soft in the head and a worrier. If he was Ivan, he wondered, where was Dennis? He decided to set off in search of Dennis that is in search of himself. He put on his boots and a cloak and trudged out in the rain, squelching through the mud, calling Dennis Dennis in his surprisingly booming baritone until his throat was raw. Only the birds perched in the wind swept trees answered him calling and cooing and chirping. But Dennis was not so soft in their head that he thought one of the Mariann birds was Dennis. Father Ivan Plunkett returned to his presbytery shattered by death. his housekeeper, Mrs. clank, a widow made him a pot of tea. The pot was shrouded in a tea cozy she had knitted for him with great expertise depicting in wall the martyrdom of Saint Spivak. His had been a gruesome death and Mrs. Clank had had much needed of wool dyed deep red for all the blood that spurted from poor st Spivak in his agony. It was a scene of great meaning for the housekeeper for her late husband had died 14 years before in an almost identical manner at the hands of Britons. But he had not died for his face, and so had not been canonized. Mrs. Clank was too much of a realist to hope he ever would be. She busied herself dusting a statue of the bvm while father Ivan Plunkett drank his tea and groaned. Failing to find the shadow dentists in the face And farms there about Dennis was reluctant to return to the house of death, where in his mother lay, so he made for the village. He called in at the tattooist and had the name, Ivan emblazoned across his puny chest. He wanted it on his forehead, but the tattooist was an ethical man with a code to which he kept against all blandishments. He knew Dennis for as well as conducting his tattoo business. He piloted an air ambulance and had many a time flown to Dennis's mother's bedside in recent months as she suffered. Poor befuddled, Dennis did not recognize him, and did not tell him that his mother had passed to the other side. Leaving the premises Dennis did not fastened his cloak across his front, so this tattoo was visible to everyone who passed him in the village streets.

By nightfall, the slaughtering had ceased in all the farmyard saved one there screwin hoon Puj farm, the killing continued in the Erie bomb. Dennis stumbled into the scene of horror on his way home. Soft in the head, he had strayed from his path in the darkness. The Britons were a blood crazed and ruthless lot, but they were also to a man in Thrall to rustic folk tales of ghosties and sprites and imps eek yelled the first who saw Dennis, it is Ivan come back from the grave to Avengers. Between straying from his path and entering the band, Denis toppled into a ditch and he was splattered with Mark as as a zombie might be clambering to the surface from its tomb in the churchyard. With his piggy eyes and snub nose and scrupulously tended boufal slathered in pomade, Dennis bought a startling resemblance to Ivan clank, the housekeeper's husband slain by the Britons 14 years before as they scattered, terrified into the night, leaving Dennis alone in the eerie bond with the dead and dying victims of their latest enormity. We might ask if it was indeed father Ivan Plunkett, to whom Dennis's mother had called in her last moments. Might it have been rather Ivan clank, the bailiff her elicit enamorado of days along vanished.

And now I'm extremely pleased to present for the first time ever on British radio on probably World Radio a true account of the discovery of the tomb of an X agrotech. be known that on the 14th day of the month of March in the year of pixelings, last Mr. stob, the on secretary of the pointy town chapter of the Tuesday Weld fanclub harder charabanc for the purposes of an excursion to outlying parts of the said town, there to picnic and exchange pictorial collector's cards of Tuesday. Well, her contemporaries and her peers. The driver of the shadow bank was a man of frightful countenance and evil reputation, that he was said to have phantom limbs additional to his given limbs, and that though these could not be perceived by the human eye in ordinary daylight, they were nevertheless present and said driver might be said to have the form of a gigantic spider, where he ever seen hole that the cost of the higher of the sharer bank and the driver was met by subscription to the excursions and picnicking fund of the Tuesday world fan club, administered by the on treasurer, Mr. brimstone, that Mr. Thorpe and Mr. brimstone were at loggerheads by cause of imponderables and fathomless mysteries, known to number they and their wives and their late Beagle, Mr. flail perished of an au in the month of February passed. The relict of Mr. flail was confined to a madhouse wherein she did knit in a frenzy in all her hours of wakefulness That the shower bank driver by name bins, having agreed a route to the picnicking spot with Mr. thud did diverged his vehicle up into the hills when his intention was to deliver all the excursion in members of the Tuesday Weld fan club into the clutches of the grumpy man who dwelt in a layer in said hills. That bins was to gain no pecuniary advantage from this treachery in that his sole purpose was mystery, fun malfeasance. That's the babblings of the excursionists within the sharer bank, excited them to such degree that none took cognizance of the divergence that much frost and Islay on the roads in that month of May, for it was a bitter season, that there was no grid to be had nor were with all of pointy town civic gritting persons to spread it upon the roads if there had been, for they were in dispute with regard to this depend and held banners in a throng outside the Civic Hall, and had tubs which they stamped with main force. That notwithstanding his great merit as a driver of the sharer bank, Ben's cause the vehicle to skid ski score school off the appointed way and go plunging into a ditch some four miles as the crow flies past the bypass that blister lane that had been taken the route agreed with Mr. thurb. Such an accident would never have occurred. That the gentlemen and ladies of the Tuesday Weld fan club conducted themselves with decency and aplomb that those who had been holed from the shower bank assisted those who remained within its twisted wreckage to make their escape, that they gathered in the ditch and sipped with goo daintiness from flasks of soup piping hot that the on correspondence secretary, Mrs. glooty, distributed to all Dr. Gillespie's famous and trustworthy brain powders for the alleviation of disorders of the nerves and integuments that tears of emotion were shared. When it was seen that this the thug and Mr. brimstone were putting aside their differences in the face of calamity, and were shaking hands with each other with manly forbearance.

That a considerable time elapsed before it was noted that the charabanc driver bins was not present with the others in the ditch that said bins had taken to his heels at the first opportunity that his fleeing gained much expedition from the fact that his visible heels were accompanied by any number of Phantom heals. The direction of bins fleeing was into the hills, where he threw himself upon the mercy of the grumpy man with terrible bear wailings that he had failed in his appointed task. The grunty man was a stranger to mercy and grunted loud and all for grunts and drag bins into the depths of his lair. That not hide nor hair of bins was ever seen again on this spinning Earth. That the composure of the members of the Tuesday Weld fan club was a magnificent thing and I pride on the pointy town that when wounds were bandaged and shattered bones set with splint like clambered forth each and every one from the ditch to make the journey home on foot. That night fell and they lost their way, yet did not once screech in terror, nor complain of chill that they kept their spirits up by calling one to another the titles of feature films in which Tuesday Weld had appeared, to which another would respond by calling out the name of the character she had played in said feature film so that Mr. brimstone might call rally around the flag boys and Mrs. glitchy call comfort good pasture, or Mr. Sub call the Private Lives of Adam and Eve and the on picnics Secretary Mrs. Blair's call in return vandrie Harper that such jollies were brought cruelly to a close when it happened in the darkness that Mr. Sub collided with an enormous block of masonry and was knocked insensible that Mrs. glooty had exhausted her supply of Dr. Gillespie's powders but was able to revive Mr. club with a draft of Aqua beside water from a canister within her handbag. That it was resolved to remain in the lead of the enormous block of masonry pending the break of dawn, for it provided some shelter from a wild wind which now was roaring. That to pass the time until dawn, the excursionists hummed tunes made famous by Dudley Moore and pink cast Zuckerman, respectively, the second and third husbands of Tuesday Weld that when dawn came an examination was made of the masonry it was found to be covered in greatly mysterious inscriptions and an alphabet unknown to even the most erudite member of the Tuesday Weld fan club. That this was by common acclaim Mr. Sham Beco, who was the author of many learned books, among them being a history of pointy town, a topographical description of the area around the blister lane bypass and a shot by shot analysis of the feature film. I'll take Sweden, in which Tuesday Weld appeared as the character Joe Joe Holcomb that in scraping clumps of mud from the masonry, the better to view the inscriptions, it became apparent that much of the block remains submerged below the ground that Mrs. gliffy produced from her handbag, a number of gardening travels, which she carried on the aborted excursion, in case within the vicinity of the picnic spot had grown such plants as campion's and hellebore and lupins for the digging up and transplanting to her garden behind the house on turpentine Boulevard in pointy town. That those of the party not yet faint with exhaustion, set to with a will a traveling away the mud to reveal as much of the enormous block of masonry as their efforts might allow.

That thus was discovery made of the ancient tomb of anax A grow tax that Mr. Sham Beco thereafter wrote an account of the discovery and embarked upon an extensive lecture tour of many countries that Mr. Sham Beco never failed to acknowledge the inadvertent part played by the evil spidery share bank driver bins that it remains unknown who or what an axle grow tax was or ease or in what era he lived if ever he lived at all, that his tomb now gleaming is surrounded by a fence to deter souvenir hunters. And that propped against the tomb in a plain wooden frame coated with protection against the elements is a publicity photograph of Tuesday Weld, taken circa 1963 during production of the feature film soldier in the rain, in which he appeared as the character Bobby Joe Pepperdine, that it is apt that a soldier stands guard in a century box beside the tomb of an axe to grow tax and that it is raining and that there is no roof upon the box. So the rain falls directly upon the soldier whose bag declares his name as private Pepperdine.

strolling by the canal the other morning when I was accosted by an acronym as bow carrying raffia and narrow Yoruba mentality. he growled something unintelligible at me in his barbaric in it sprecher which I countered by telling him as bravely as I could, that I offered him the chance to turn himself from an acronym into an across stick, and as bow carrying Rafi and of spiritual transfiguration in Christ. without waiting phase reply, I whipped out of my pocket my much thumbed paperback copy of the Selected Poems of duck mesmerizing Victorian Jesuit, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and immediately I began to declaim in a booming voice, God's Granger. The world is charged with the granddaughter of God. It will flame out like she Shining from shock foil, it gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil crushed. The acronym was to sank in his vacuity to react in any perceptible way. But the words of Hopkins are shocking and mighty and irresistible. And I knew I had the upper hand. Nearby on a leaf Amelie bargain fell its wings and soared high into the heavens. My work was almost done. I took the acronym by the hand and led him towards the church where far the buggies were weighted with an old rugged cross, and a handful of nails. I patted my pocket feeling from a hammer I carried there. I look forward to landing the first blow nailing to the rough wood, the filthy Rafi and hand I held in mine.

And finally, this week, some advice on napping. I'm a great enthusiast for the postprandial nap, which I like to think of as a mark of civilized behavior. And, indeed, when I posted this, this note on the hooting yard website, one of my commenters Brit, who regularly reads and comments said that in fact, human beings are not are not meant to be awake during the afternoon. sentiment I'm actually agreed with. However, I was somewhat alarmed to read the advice of Dr. Andrew bored, that's B double o r d, writing in his dietary of health, in 1542. And this is what he says, How Men of what age or complexion soever they be of should take their natural rest and sleep in the night and to astrue all meridional sleep, but and need shall compel man to sleep upon his meal. Sorry, but and need shall compel man to sleep upon his meat. Let him make a pause and then let him stand and lean and sleep against the cupboard. So there you have it. Next time you want to postprandial nap in the afternoon, find a cupboard, lean against it, and fall asleep. That's why I might be doing shortly. Possibly. I'll be back next week with more stuff from hooting yard. I hope you've enjoyed the show and learned a great deal of moral improvement from it as ever. Bye bye
