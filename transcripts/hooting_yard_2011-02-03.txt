Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. And it's Quiz time listeners limber up those cranial integuments and see if you can answer the following brain teaser. Who wrote these words? After fight on was a small, White Swan shaped carriage, ornamented with golden designs and propelled by a galvanic battery in the graceful Swan head, which, at my request, took the place of the ordinary steed. This was to me an exceedingly novel mode of travel, which my short sojourn in the spirit world had prevented me from before enjoying. So was that written by a Washington Irving, or be the spirit form of Washington Irving? transmitting its thoughts by mysterious means from its habitation in ethereal realms. If you listen to the show last week, you've probably guessed the answer. The correct answer is B. The spirit form of Washington Irving transmitted its thoughts by mysterious means to Henry J. Horn, who transcribed them in his 1871 book, strange visitors, a series of original papers embracing philosophy, science, government, religion, poetry, art, fiction, satire, humor, narrative and prophecy, by the spirit of Irving Willis, Thackeray, Bronte Richter, Byron, Humboldt, Hawthorne, Wesley browning, and others now dwelling in the spirit world dictated through a clairvoyant while in an abnormal or trance state. A book which, if you've been listening closely, you will remember from last week anyway, it's a simple enough matter to embed a galvanic battery in the graceful head of a swarm provided that is your a buffin. With some training and the basic techniques of veterinary surgery. the lay person or amateur is likely to face difficulties, not only with the bloody business of embedding, but also in telling the difference between a galvanic battery and other types of battery. And indeed, in knowing what a swan looks like, the owner psychological ignorance of some people is breathtaking, and that can include boffins, for example, I once met a boffin and acknowledged wizard at home in the lab heating various substances in glass tubes over a Bunsen burner who mistook a Heron for a cassowary. If you can imagine such bird blindness. And don't get me started on the story of the boffin who pointed at a flock of swooping swift in the sky and said, Ah, I love the sight of sweeping praten coals a boffin who has grasped the basics of veterinary surgery however, should not a swan when they see one, and depending on their field of boffin hood otter bear with a pick a galvanic battery out of a lineup of various types of battery. There are cases where the name of the battery type is etched or stamped on the body of the battery itself for ease of identification, and then no familiarity with batteries is required. However, it is rare or rare indeed, to find a bird so etched or stamped, one must learn few, at least a few basic identification skills to pick a swarm out of a lineup. But I will not give the impression that the putative embedder must first pick out a galvanic battery, and then select a swarm from a pair of lineups like identity parades, such as arranged by following an arrest connected to a heist. It's much more common to be called in to perform the embedding and to find a galvanic battery and a swan already provided the one resting on a countertop and the other stand with anesthetic fast asleep in a basket. Even the most stupid person will know which is the battery and which is the bird, I hope and to relay even the merest smidgen of Doubt some form of signage can be installed cheaply using a couple of sheets of cardboard and a magic marker pen. To make

absolutely sure the word galvanic battery and Swan on the signs can be accompanied by simple pictograms for the illiterate add to each sign and emboldened arrow pointing clearly towards what a barely French intellectual would call the referent and Bob's your uncle. Now, I mentioned that the embedding is a bloody business. And so it is. There is no way of slicing an opening in the graceful head of the swan without causing a flow of hot red Swan Gore. It's helpful to have a gaggle of eager unpaid interns to staunch this and to mop up inevitable spillages. So the embedder can get on with the task at hand, which is to embed the galvanic battery into the Swann's head by shoving it oh so delicately through the bloody slit until it's lodged firmly next to the swans brain. Note that the brain of a swarm will always be located in its head, rather than elsewhere in its anatomy. That done so up the slit with buttress string and slap a bandage over it. If the bandage is white, as is common, and the swan is white. as is common, the casual observer may not even notice that the embedding has taken place. That may or may not be important, depending upon the legal regulations obtaining in the jurisdiction. Some authorities take a dim view of the embedding of galvanic batteries in the graceful heads of swans, though for the life of me, I cannot think why that might be so. In any case, it's better to check the legal position beforehand. A lot of listeners will have spotted that I omitted to mention perhaps the most crucial part of the process, which is the bit where the galvanic battery is actually attached to the brain of the swan by wires. In practice, of course, one would never miss this out. Otherwise, the entire operation would be a waste of time and effort. However, unlike the slicing and cutting and shoving and staunching and mopping up, the wiring is a fiddly and complicated matter, fraught with god awful difficulties, and deserves a separate article written in fiddly and complicated prose, to which the listener must pay unflinching attention, while also being wide awake, and probably half crazed with stimulants. That article has yet to be written. And it will need to be approved by experts in the fields of galvanic batteries, and of swans and the wiring before I can read it here for your instruction and edification.

Well, in that brief pause while when I stopped talking for five minutes or two minutes, or however long it was 30 seconds, probably when I stopped talking and you listen to to the Caucasian lullaby in that time, and I wrote the piece about insert attaching the wiring of the battery, to the brain of the swan. Now, so I had intended to give you precise instructions for the wiring up of that galvanic battery to the brain inside the graceful head of the swamp. But do you know what? I had no idea just how fiddly and complicated the process it was going to be. I'm no butter fingers, but look so mercy Gov. I botched it up good and proper. with hindsight, I ought to have spotted the telltale clue that Washington Irving, or rather His Spirit form was talking twaddle all along. It was the ethereal shade of Irving you will recall who mentioned the galvanic battery and their head of the swamp in the mystic communication from the beyond. He dictated to Henry j Horne in 1871. But if you read it again carefully, he writes over galvanic battery in the graceful swarm the head I missed it on a casual reading, and perhaps you did too. It's not the head of a swarm that's graceful, but its neck. A certain gracefulness is imparted to the swans head by dint of it being perched atop the incredibly graceful neck, but the head by itself is far from graceful. In fact, it's savage and menacing. You can see this for yourself by the simple expedient of looking at a swans head in isolation from the graceful Swan neck to which it's usually attached. I'm not of course, suggesting for a moment that you hike over to the nearest pond or canal armed with a razor sharp cleaver, and start beheading any swans, you might find gliding gracefully across the water. There are laws against such behavior, and rightly so. Or where would we be, but in a state of anarchy, littered with the severed heads of swarms their bloodied corpses staining our ponds and canals, red with Swan gore? No, all you need to do to grasp My point is to take a cardboard swarm and snip off the head with a hefty pair of scissors, toss the body and the neck onto a pyre and make a careful study of the detached head. Where I asked you, where is the grace? I think you will find that what grace there was lay in the curvature of the neck, the cardboard neck now turning to ashes in the Blaze. If we assume that Henry J. Horn made an accurate transcription of the Spirit witterings of Washington Irving, we must conclude that the author of a history of New York from the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty by Diedrich Knickerbocker. 1809 didn't know his swans from his starlings, at least not after he had passed from his earthly domain into the Elysium fields. Perhaps in his translucent, shimmering, ghostly form, he forgot what a swan was exactly. That's possible, for which of us can say with certainty that we will retain our own or theological wisdom beyond the grave. But before we truck brick back to the dead, Washington Irving, there is another possibility we can consider given that he was communicating from what he calls the spirit world. Could it be that the swan head into which the galvanic battery was implanted with the head not of a swan, but of a spirit Swan? It may well be that spirit swans have graceful heads as well as graceful next. Alas, we cannot put this theory to the test. For just as we're in no position to go around the heading spirits swans, nor do we have the means to make one out of cardboard. So far as I'm aware, if you know any different, please let me know.

Whether or not we give Washington Irving in spirit form the benefit of the doubt, it remains the fact that wiring up the galvanic battery to the swans brain proved far too complicated for me. In mitigation, remember that I was working against the clock, though the serum with which the swan had been injected was a powerful one. It had to wake from its coma at some point. And I didn't want to find myself running around in its head, talking at wires and bits of its brain when it regained consciousness. Do you have any idea how implacable can be the ferocity of a swarm, even in circumstances less likely to provoke it seek night to rough so I'm afraid it's back to the drawing board. We've successfully inserted a galvanic battery in a swans not remotely graceful head lodged against its brain, but a fat lot of good that will do us if we cannot connect them up. I'm currently investigating possible wireless methods. And we'll let you know as soon as I have something further to report.

Any account of Aesop's Fables is necessarily hampered by the fact that we know so very little about him. Indeed, it's not certain that he ever actually existed, assuming for the moment that he did exist and made up At least some of the stories attributed to him. We could advance the idea that it is a peculiar foible to bang on about animals having the powers of human speech and reason. It's the sort of conceit a writer might use once or twice for a particular artistic purpose. But to keep returning to it again and again, indicates a low level mania we could describe as a foible. Then there is Plutarco story that Aesop was convicted of theft from a temple and subsequently thrown off a cliff. charitably, we could say that petty larceny, such as stealing a bitty Bob from a place of worship is better described as a football than as the character flaw of the habitual criminal as revealed by friend ology. But these are slim pickings. And until we're able to discover more about the historical Aesop, we have no basis upon which to impute further foibles to him.

This is a quotation. Happily, but the goodness of the all wise disposal of events, the unfortunate can avail themselves of 1000 sources of comfort, which, by those in prosperous circumstances, are either overlooked or neglected. We were upon a barren rock, in the midst of a waste of waters, far from kindred and friend. Sorry, we were upon a barren rock, in the midst of a waste of waters, far from kindred and friends, and the abodes of civilized man. The ship which had been our home, and on board of which we had embarked with high hopes, lie within sight, a useless wreck. Still, we were unable to enjoy a moment of relief, if not of actual pleasure, derived from an event which so trifling in itself is worthy of being recorded. We succeeded in taking an eel, a few crabs, and a small quantity of snails. Having our fireworks with us, we collected a sufficient number of sticks with a few pieces of driftwood, which had lodged upon the rock to make a fire. With this, we cooked our fish and snails, and with a small allowance of bread, we made what we then thought, a sumptuous repast. That's a quote from the 1836 book by Horace Holden, entitled, a narrative of the shipwreck, captivity and sufferings of Horace Holden, and Benj. Ah nuit, who were cast away in the American ship mentor on the pehlu islands in the year 1832, and for two years afterwards, was subjected to unheard of sufferings among the barbarous inhabitants of broad North Island. Given that they were cast away on an island inhabited by by barians It's surprising that Ben h newt and his pals were not able to eke out their eel, crab and snails with a goodly supply of rhubarb. However, that aside, it shouldn't be supposed that Benj h newt vanished from history after his ordeal as recounted in a narrative of the shipwreck, captivity and sufferings of Horace Holden, and Benj. Ah nuit, who were cast away in the American ship and mentor on the pallu islands in the year 1832. And for two years afterwards, was subjected to unheard of sufferings among the barbarous inhabitants of North Lord North Island by Henry Holden 1836. We know from that book that Benj h nuit never reconciled himself to the fashion of going without clothes, that he was intrepid, that among the barbarous savages he went by the name of Rollo, and that he was concealed for some time, under some mats at the taboo, a place of public resort. Henry Holden tells us nothing more about his companion, and if it were not for the indefatigable research skills of Eben j hunt, that would be that, but now in a magisterial piece of literary historical data detective work.

It would be remiss of me not to include in this exciting chat book, at least a passing mention of the mysterious figure named Rollo, who, reluctantly without clothing hid under a mat in the public resort known as the taboo, like the other person who is whose deeds and adventures I have chronicled in these pages.

Well do I remember how one night as we narrowly averted a lethal collision with an iceberg? I found the stowaway hiding under a mat. His name was Rollo, and despite the arctic cold, he was entirely without clothing. I dragged him from under the mat and tossed him overboard. The last I saw of him, he was clinging to the iceberg. He struck me as a very intrepid fellow, and I had no doubt that he would find a way out of the pickle I had put him in. And it seems he did for hunt fourth Inklings that Benj Ah, Newt had an afterlife beyond his Maroon mint came by happy accident when skim reading a forgotten 1875 children's primer by Constance Pope, entitled Itsy Bitsy and floppy pigs, he stumbled upon this passage.

that's the end of this week's show. There's just time to mention the fact that one has to admire Mr. And Mrs. Vaughn hohenheim. The parents of paracelsus 1493 to 1541. forgiving they're taught the cristea names philippus oriolus, theophrastus bombast us two things worth remembering about paracelsus as that he was the first person to call zinc zinc. Actually, he called it zinc him, and he kept a small avian devil imprisoned in the palm of his sword. Samuel Butler noted this in hoodoo brass, where he wrote basters Capital devils bird shot in the palm of his sword that taught him all the cutting pranks of past and future mounted banks. So I hope before next week's show you learn some of the cutting pranks of mounted banks. And I may turn my mind to teaching myself some of them too. That's the end of this week's show.
