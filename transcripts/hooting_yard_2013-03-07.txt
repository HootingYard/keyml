Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. First, to be comparatively small, secondly, to be smooth. Thirdly, to have a variety in the direction of the parts. But fourthly to have those parts not Angular, but melted as it were into each other. fifthly to be a delicate frame, without any remarkable appearance of strength, six, three to have its colors clear and bright, but not very strong and glaring. Seven three, or if it should have any glaring color, to have it diversified with others. That is a description of something beautiful, from Edmund Burke's, a philosophy of philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and the beautiful, from 1757. First, it was small. In fact, it was tiny, and I made it seem even tinier than it actually was, by placing it next to some pretty big things. If I had surrounded it with, say, lemons or PIN cushions, it would still have been tiny, but it would hold its own as it were, among such fruit and cloth. So in order to emphasize, even to exaggerate its timeliness. I swept away all the scattered lemons and pin cushions. And in their place, I put a couple of life sized Pappy and mash a models of towels and then industrial washing machine. I could of course have left the lemons and pin cushions where they were and simply removed the tiny thing and found a new home for it. That would have saved time, but I had time on my hands since the fall of the regime. Also, I could now squeeze all the lemons and stick pins in all the pin cushions. In other words, make use of them. Instead of leaving them scattered about pointlessly heaving the Pappy and mash a cow's on the washing machine into place took the wind out of me. So I went to have a lie down. I turned the volume down on the radio, which was playing stirring and patriotic anthems and I dosed. Secondly, it was smooth, it was not smooth to begin with. But when I woke from my nap, I fetch some sandpaper from my sandpaper crammed desk drawer and rubbed away at the thing, smoothing all the rough edges of hand I cannot recall what grade of sandpaper I used. But I made a note of it at the time in my jata with my propelling pencil in case it ever cropped up as a matter of concern during an interrogation. But it never did. And eventually I cast the jata into a furnace. I suspect I shall regret having done so one of these days, but not yet. Not yet, fingers crossed. Thirdly, it had variety in the direction of the parts. Some parts of it pointed one way some another and some in still other directions. That makes it sound complicated, but it wasn't. And to say the part pointed might suggest they were pointy parts, but they weren't, at least not after I had sanded them down with the grade whatever sandpaper. I say they pointed in a direction. When I suppose what I thought more correctly say is that the different parts faced in different directions. Or that depending on where you were when you cast your eyes upon it, you would see different aspects of it. Much like any other solid object really in this solid world. Fourthly, on that mistaken idea of pointedness I should stress that not only was it not at all pointy, but that its various parts looked as if they were melted into each other. This is hardly surprising. After my nap and my bout of sandpapering I fetched a blowtorch from the janitors cupboard and lifted and aimed it at the tiny thing. The heat was terrific matches I believe in my heart of hearts. the fires of hell to be, and it took less than a minute for parts of the thing to melt pleasingly into one another.

Unfortunately, my blowtorch technique was somewhat slapdash, and I inadvertently set fire to one of the Pappy and X ray cows. The resulting blaze brought a goon squad galumphing through my door, but fortunately my papers were in order. I have to acknowledge their help in extinguishing the cow before it was too badly damaged. fifthly it was very delicate particularly after all that sanding and blasting with a blowtorch. In fact, I became worried that it would fold a bit that's why I put the industrial washing machine between it and the window where the draft gets in. Even a mild sudden gust might shatter it it was so delicate. I resolved to obtain one of those draft excluder sausages when next I had the necessary coupons and path. I suppose I could have run while at myself, possibly by stitching all the pin cushions end to end to form a sausage. But quite frankly, the prospect unnerved me. I am too timid to risk illegal needle work under the current regime sixthly its colors were clear and bright without being strong and glaring. Initially it was a sort of doll done beige. But after my nap and the sanding and the blasting with a blowtorch and the visit from the goon squad and the extinguishing of the Pappy and mash a cow. I gave it a lick of paint, a dab of yellow and a dab of red and a sort of wash of lilac or lavender. The colors had a very pleasing effect. Because it was such a tiny thing I used a very small paintbrush and painted with care. After the hullabaloo with the blowtorch. I did not want to risk splattering paint all over the place either the cows and the industrial washing machine. So I devoted several hours to the painting until the pips on the radio indicated it was time for the night rally in the field behind the viaduct. Seven three because the red and yellow dabs stood out in a vaguely glaring way from the overall lilac or lavender wash. I got a damp cloth from the janitors cupboard and smudge them a bit so the colors sort of shaded into one another. But that had to wait until I got home from the night rally dog tired and hoarse from shouting my undying hatred of the previous regime. It was only after reading Edmund Burke, I realized that there between the Pappy amaxra cows and the industrial washing machine. I had a tiny of unsurpassed beauty. I pray that it will not be confiscated by the peasant army.

Sorry about that slight interference in the previous piece of some kind of technical problem. And but I hope it didn't spoil your enjoyment of the of the show. The appointed pointy panel of the point town Institute of pointedness was rocked to its foundations yesterday by explosive revelations of malfeasance perfectly and pelf. unnamed sources suggested that the entire edifice could be brought crashing to the ground. Let there be no mistake said the source. There has been malfeasance at the highest levels as well as perfectly and pelf and not only at the highest levels, but several levels Stratta quite how we go forward following these explosive revelations is unclear, but go forward we shall pointedly the revelations first threatened to become combustible shortly after breakfast time and exploded immediately thereafter. So explosive were the explosions that trees including planes, poplars, pines larches six moods and use were flattened and birds dropped dead from the sky. An eerie orangey purpley yellowish mist, a spread pointy town rendering most of the pointed is a bit barely visible. I have not seen anything like this since that business of the illegal picnicking who heart of your said one old timer. A grizzled, sto t fellow leaning against a wall in a pointy part of town. So ancient we'll see that nobody else had a clue what he was talking about. Other pointy towers were more or less circumspect. Someone not circumspect at all, several had difficulty grasping the concept of circumspection and of pointedness. And even of malfeasance and perfectly and health. Personally, I can't see what all the fuss is about, said a man who gave his name as una new Gu. Standing hopelessly as a decommissioned bus stop. I'm just waiting for the 60 666 he said, even though the little dwarvish familiar perched on my shoulder, invisible to all but me, tells me it will never pass this way again. But if I believed everything it told me I would not be a salt of the earth citizen of pointy town, would I. Markets reacted in guttering fashion to the explosive revelations. The pain dropped precipitously, then sprang back up and kept on springing until it settled just before dusk at parity with the grieb emergency coat hangers on T strainers have been drafted in the end trailed of a slaughtered out bino hand will be read today at midday by a herro specs with a klaxon on a balcony in a thunderstorm.

A quick reminder, as I occasionally do, to go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org where you can read all of the things that I read out for yourself if you wish to and look at pictures. And while you're there, you can buy paperback books full of Mr. Keys babblings which I recommend, or you can send me a donation that's always helpful. So go to hooting yard.org for that to the kind of online hooting yard experience. I was out one day observing birds when I saw what I consider to be a particularly Sparky little plover No, I'm gonna start again. I was out one day observing birds when I saw what I consider to be a particularly Sparky little clover. I said as much to my walking companion doll see the bird woman? Look down. See, I said pointing. Is that not a Sparky clover? I pronounced clover to rhyme with the plant clover. I think you will find hist dalasi the bird woman whose every its utterance was a hiss. That is pronounced plover to rhyme with the trade of Glover, a man who makes his gloves. But be that as it may, what could possibly lead you to dub it Sparky? It is not shooting for sparks. And if it were I think the both of us would be mightily disconcerted. I was using the word Sparky as father Hopkins deployed it in his juvenile verse drama florists in Italy, I said, where he writes, quote, such spider's web he ties across his site, insert ellipses, guilds with some Sparky fancies blinding night. Unquote, where Sparky is a synonym for lively or vivacious. It is in the same sense, it was used as the name of a weekly children's comic I used occasionally to read when others are taught. a different sense then to the sparks translated from the Russian is scrapped, which was a no children's comic, but an organ of Bolshevik propaganda in pre revolutionary Russia history dulcy who was surprisingly erudite in many matters, not relating to birds. Oh, I wouldn't know about that I said, I'm woefully ignorant of Bolshevism. We were standing having pause to take in the clover on a path winding alongside an estuary. Scattered here and there beside the path. Well, the stumps of unknown trees. Don't see the bird woman sat down on one and took from her bag of greaseproof paper package containing a sandwich. Of course, she hissed between lunches, a robot plover might emit sparks had something gone awry with its wiring, but only a fool would build such a robot. I nodded. I had not brought any sandwiches with me, for I was feckless. I have to say continued dancy that your plover seems neither more nor less lively and vivacious than any other plover nor indeed than any other wading bird. It is merely going about its business in the shallows of the edge of the estuary. It's not my clover, I protested. She fixed me with an old somehow menacing look as she swallowed the last of her sandwich. Are you quite sure of that? She hissed. It is merely a clover I spotted and described as Sparky, I said, Why would I lay any further claim to it? dulcie the bird woman chuckled to herself, then hissed. It was said of both Rudolf Steiner and cu n lines that they seem to emit flashes of mysterious light. Perhaps you're Sparky plava to is such a marvel. Look. I was already looking at the clover. And sure enough, it suddenly cast for the flash of glittering effulgence a brilliant radiance that would have blinded me had I not turned my head away and shut my eyes. When I opened them again. I saw that dancy had put on a pair of sunglasses and was eating a plum. That is very interesting bird. She just, you were right to point it out it alone among all the other plovers and dot rolls and wading birds.

Here, take this net and bag your Sparky plover and take it home with you. It will not resist it is your bird familiar? I had no idea what she was talking about. But as if in a dream, I took the neck she had drawn out of her puppy bag, and I scampered off towards the shoreline towards the clover. Was it really mine? Was it really my familiar? As I closed upon it, fanning out the net is again shot for a flash of incandescent light. And in that moment, it seemed I and the bird and the light were all one. Was it a moment? Or was it a year, a century, a millennium? I could not tell. But when the light faded, I dug my short stubby barrel into the sand and pulled out a juicy worm. And as I guzzled it down, I looked up and saw sitting on the stump of an unknown tree a woman. She stood up hoisted a bag over her shoulder and before walking away, she chucked a plum stone at me. It missed me by a whisker.

One of my uncle's was a hedger who had his own deck, and another uncle was a dictator who had laid claim to a hedge. That's the thing about being a peasant, it can be mightily confusing. When I was a taught, I always used to get the hedger uncle and the dicta uncle mixed up. Their brother my father tried to teach me which was which, though his pedagogical methods were rather unusual. He seemed to be Believe I might learn to tell I hedger from Aditya by penning me in a pigsty among the many pigs from dawn till dusk with Clayton's chalk, and a sort of metal harness on my head, a contraption he had beaten out of a broken turn. My father, you see, unlike his brothers, was a peasant with ideas. few if any of them were sensible ideas, nor any of them, the fruits of rustic wisdom handed down through the ages. No, my father's ideas sprang fully formed into his head. It was an old head, a bit too large for his body, plum colored and top two with an extravagant Buffon that might better have suited a Maestro of the Opera House. Somebody had once told my father that his head had to be a bit too big in order to contain comfortably his gigantic brain that they were crushing him, never occurred to papa. He really believed in the absence of any x rays or probes or scans, that he had an enormous and concomitantly powerful brain. When he died, I took it upon myself to remove the brain from his skull using a saw, and I discovered it to be no bigger than the average adult human brain. If anything veered towards the smallest size, I put it in a jar filled to the brim with Brian screwed the cap on tight, and then released his body to the priest for burial, but not before gluing the top of his head back on to conceal evidence of my unauthorized sewing. He was the first of the brothers to go. So when I held a little awake after the funeral, both my uncle's the hedgerow with the ditch and the ditcher with the hedge were present. They were leaning against the pigsty fence glugging Grog, from tin beakers, and muttering to each other in their guttural barbaric peasant, our God. It made no sense to me, as one of my father's mad ideas had been to bring me up to speak as if I were a person of consequence in the world. Last my speaking voice, in addition to my slight and chalk in my metal head harness, marked me out from my fellows and made me something of an oddball. Now that Papa was dead, I felt I should get to know my uncle's better, or at least well enough to tell the one from the other. I thought they might be interested to see the brain in the jar. So I took it from the shelf in the barn where I kept it and approached them at the pigsty fence. Hello, uncles, I piped up in my highfalutin voice. Look what I've got here. They turned the hedger and the dictator, from gazing at the pig to gazing at me. In their eyes, I saw thousands of years of stupidity and rustic ignorance. And at once I knew I would never be able to make myself understood to them, the hedgerow or possibly the ditcher grunted, and the other belt. This is Paul's brain, I said, waving the jar in front of them. You see, it was not so huge after all. Then they both spat into their beakers, and each must my hair or as much of it as they could must through the metal harness. And they trudged away the one to his head towards ditch and the other two is ditch your head was all so long ago. I think of them now. My uncle's as I swamp at my desk in my ivory tower, surrounded by fat, dusty books, books in incomprehensible languages, and that they're on a high shelf sits the jar of brine containing my father's brain is shriveled over the years, until it's a tiny thing, a tiny thing indeed.

Excuse me. My father is a hedger and diksha. My mother does nothing but spin. And as for me, well, I wallow in sin. At least I would say while I Were there any opportunities for sin in this god awful rustic backwater? Oh, how I would like to be a lascivious Urban volupte Curie. fat and greasy. Instead, I have to spend my days surrounded by straw and hay and pigs. Pigs are numbered, and my night tossing and turning on a pallet and a hayloft, exhausted yet sleepless, jangled, brained and hopeless. Sometimes I pour over maps, searching for a path or lane that might lead from this hellhole to a city of sin. If ever I find one, I shall stuff a few sorry provisions into a hankie and tie it to the end of a stick, and tote the stick over my shoulder, and set off one crack of dawn to march along that path or lane towards my fat and disgusting destiny. Yesterday, the village priest came shambling past the pigsty, and I hailed him, I asked him to hear my confession, we went into a secluded corner of a barn. Bless me, Father, I said, though I have not sinned much as I would wish to. Then you are a pure and holy person, perhaps even a saint, he replied. But what of my sinful thoughts I asked. So what he said, You are a peasant, and the child of peasants? Surely you cannot claim to have an inner life? Are you not empty headed, more akin to a beast of the field? But I do have thought I protested. This, the priest looked vexed and troubled. He told me that if I did indeed have thoughts within my head, I must be a very peculiar peasant. Indeed, he posited that I might be a changeling. I shall have to question your manpower very closely, my child, he said, and get them to recollect the precise circumstances of your birth. It may be that they found you bundled up in swaddling cloth, the abandoned babe of a wicked, sophisticated urban person. Gosh, I said. And that's it was that later, the priest took me by the hand and led me away from the straw and the hay and the numerous pigs a way along a line that led to a city. He did not allow me time to gather a few mega provisions and bundle them up in a hankie and tie the hankie to a stick. And so I was delivered to the city with nothing but the peasant rags I was dressed in under a letter of introduction to a morally bankrupt urban thought of the priest acquaintance. After I waved goodbye to the priest, I made my way through streets teeming with sin, to the fox Buju flatlet in a high rise apartment. He was leaning against a mantle piece with a glass of brandy in one hand, and a book of evil poetry and the other My heart was thumping. I realized this was the life I had been born to the property the bees you high rise flatlet, the brandy the evil poetry. You smell a pig said the fop be gone. But but but what of social mobility? I wailed if I have a bath. The fop held up a dainty hand to Hashmi sees your barbaric grunting, he said, You speak of phantasms and from behind an heiress, his valet appeared and dragged me out of the flat late into the lift, which sank Oh, so rapidly back down to the street, later sprawled in the gutter drenched by city rainfall spat upon by passing urban sophisticates smelling of pig weeping when it seemed all hope was lost. I had a brainstorm such as occurs perhaps but once in a lifetime. The idea sparked in my head fully formed, clear in all its details, a sharp and glittering as a diamond. I had discovered the Blairites third way.
