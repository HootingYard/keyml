Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air and I'm going to tell you about the Kentish plover be Kentish plover charadrius Alexandrine plover family, habitat and range extensive Kringle banks. Summer visitor still occasionally breeds in southwest Kenton, Southeast Sussex and perhaps very locally elsewhere on the east and southeast East Coast, England. Nest, always in a scrape on dried mud or bare shingle, sometimes lined with seaweed and other local materials. Eggs and young eggs, three pile bath well sprinkled with black spots smaller and much less pear shaped than ringed plovers incubation 24 days trick, like ringed plover, but paver leaves nest within a few hours. Ring number one a season, early May to June and July, perhaps sometimes to brood

that was an extract from Collins Pocket Guide to nest and eggs. The complete identification book, every British nesting bird illustrated with 250 in color by an s are fitter and are a Richardson I picked that book up in a charity shop last weekend. It was published in the 50s I think, here's an extract from another book. This book is called Mr. Keys, shorter, potted brief, brief lives by Frank key that's me, is published by constable and is available now. So make sure you buy plenty of copies for everyone you know for Christmas. Here is an extract from it. George Louis Bouygues Argentinian writer 1899 to 1986. In 1946, Borchers was appointed to the post of Cliff poultry inspector for the Buenos Aires municipal market. He resigned immediately. Boo has tenure as a blind inspector of poultry. While brief was not without precedent. I should point out that this is no longer an extract from the shorter potted brief brief lives. Partly because it's not short. And partly because it's not about Borchers. We recall the case of pimpy two decades earlier and far, far from Buenos Aires. It might be an exaggeration to dump him as did pebble head in the title of his best selling paperback biography the illustrious pimpy but that there was a luster about him cannot be denied unless you want to start a punch up. pimp he's blind This was more blankety than Miltonic. It was the sort of man who enraged cows when he trespassed in their field, or weekends carrying a picnic basket under a thunderous sky, escaping the poultry market with it, tin roofs and yelling merchants. His prison in the week the inspectors had the Braille calendar hanging tattered from a nail on the nail rusted, pricking him if he wasn't careful, blood on his fingers, as its hands fumbled, delving into a hen's croup, prodding, inspecting, as he was paid to do. Our more than generously he got a fair whack, and he spent it on booze and floozies fight haunted the poultry market like figures from an early Kitchener Gordy Angular themselves sozzled on bathtub gin sometimes like clucked just like their hands, particularly in the early afternoon called PMT. fuddled, but active duty tape measure around his neck like a table shifting schmatta God knows why it wasn't his job to measure the hens nor their eggs. They joked he thought it was some kind of loose cravat, as if being blind he wouldn't know. They could have learned from their failed tricks. Those mischievous poulterers shoving a ball of dough stuck with feathers on the inspectors table. his rage

was as terrible as the cows when he opened the gate of the field with one hand, holding tight to the picnic basket with the other out in the midst oblivious it but not of the cows that bore down on him on Saturdays and Sundays when the poultry market was closed, shattered, a deserted patch of concrete and cement stray feathers scattered, neglected by the janitors broom, the janitor pimpy cow, sunset his half brother, Deaf as a post where the inspector was blind by made quite a pair even without the blood tie. Always playing card games at lunchtime Romney and spite and my ladies bonnet and creases nine money ever changing hands the table rickety sawdust everywhere. The stove in the corner rain on the roof, birds packing grain from the floor shadow in the door of the inspector of inspectors are looming come for the rent and a cat up pimpy defiant spitting out his words hair standing on end as if we'd seen a ghost half these heads are sick man What do you expect me to do? Have a total Jane Molly tally my Ledger's. I have to go on over word with a man about a baffle being done on a duck hook bill. And off pimpy goes weaving across the familiar yard sniffing the air. A storm brewing. Better put on his Southwestern yellow was a duck in a nursery book. Shiny cardboard pages stiff, buckled here and there as you'd expect. They remembered gazing and gazing wrapped when still so tiny with eyes that worked before the operation. The surgeon cutting the useless with nerves and then the blurb black the new life. The hard study the poultry inspection board, such an easy examination. What's this? What's that this is this. And that is that sir, a badge for merit. He still wears it polishes it buffs it daily, after breakfast tippers or bloaters. Schoenberg cassette transfigured night, day to think empty day to transfigured and transformed weekday poultry market and weekend picnic. When he gets out, humming as he approaches the gate in the field, beyond which angry cows are waiting, and he pacifies them sweet nothings try the same thing on the hands and there would be mayhem. That much he discovered one awful Thursday. It was raining them too, and he slipped on straw or grease and cashed his leg. You won't find a better tune a guy than a tape measure. Believe you may. Still there was much blood spilled before it was taught pimp t Gore, like a rare expensive wine, metallic bouquet and something in it irresistible. The Ducks dozens of them falling up on it, like starlings splashing about in his blood. The inspector deafened by clucking thinking, I better find out exactly what it is that's in my veins. I may be a miracle of medical science, who would have thought hands maddened by the blood splattered ducks shrieking tangles, add in the sirens from the emergency services and you have complete havoc, but empty back at the poultry market next morning behind this table, sticking his fingers up a duck fundament the sense of touch honoring even through the rubber glove bright yellow like the rain hat, like the ducks in the nursery book. So much yellow. It was Pierre Barnard, Who said you could never have enough yellow, no more yellow for PMT, but the yellow in his brain. Remember the yellow bright enough when the stripe ready strains the signups is you can almost hear them ping and Tang. If he listened carefully and pimped he does. He's all ears. That's why he hears the enraged cows in the field. Even before they're enraged before his thumb clicks open the gate on picnic days in sunshine or mist or once when he's watched stopped in the middle of the night high wind capital in slumber owls hooting pimpy with this rug and hamper jam sandwiches, fish paste Coco, a drowned beetle in the flask. The janitor never joins him grab the janitor.

He goes instead organized picnics for the hard of hearing to the grounds of castles and stately homes, not cow strewn field or waiting daylight light pimpy doesn't see and hasn't seen for years. By the senses it on his eternally closed leads heat and cold, damp and haze. He no longer bothers with the sunglasses they used to sport frames too heavy on the nose. They smashed them under foot in a temper drunk to hell at the time swigging as he smashed at the poultry market, but off duty on a Tuesday afternoon, with a floozy on his arm. giggling egging him on a bit batty if truth be told, or Dotty that's the word from the poultry to fund my beats in an unseemly way, kept trying to abduct a hen or a duck or a goose. Take it home as a pet. I'll go on pente no one will miss it. I can call it Flopsy or Clyde nestra and Mike a pumped for it in my bathtub, feeding grain or whatever it eats. I know that grain supplier, a man with a silo Oh pretty pleased. But for all he was drawn to grandiose debauch pimps, he was as conscientious a poultry inspector as the market ever had an E foiled her kidnapped every one of them using his luster. Really quite mysterious, but absolutely effective. Going by results, the inspector of inspectors always had a good word for him back at headquarters. Batman PMT is a bloody Marvel. Never a day goes by that his poultry inspections are the master class in the art, even when he sozzled there's a luster about him that makes my jaw drop, pimped. He never heard any of this. They never been invited into HQ, not even to the cocktail parties. A stuffy bunch and him shall we say difficult, haphazard in certain settings, liable to break things, drugs, plates, toasters, it was the devil with toasters rarely invited anywhere, hence the lonely picnics. Pin tea in a field beneath the enormous sky plotting angry cows sprawled on his rug away from the poultry. Maybe that was when he worked his luster. It was as if he admitted raise no machine honor three when he chose to switch it on, which he certainly did. When pebble head came calling. he'd heard rumors hustled into the poultry market first thing Monday morning in Cape and spat entourage of bodyguards. So where's this blind inspector I've been hearing about Tell me dammit, I have a paperback to write. Ah, good day to you, sir. Gosh, pebble head dumbstruck. slumps in a chair and assistant takes notes pimpy all the while inspecting geese and hens and ducks. Even a swan mute. He doubled up on rubber gloves, uses some sort of beam strange minute trip taught worked to controls so definitely, but the swan is dead. They prosecute the merchant. huge pile of legal papers, even bigger pile of Braille for pimpy. big thick sheets, untold thousands of dots. He knows the whole thing backwards. Fantastic witness visits the swan killer in prison, dank sell, no smoking, repent, repent, but we can never have you back. At the poultry market. You cross the line and I drew that line. Yes. And it's indelible. Like all my lines, wherever I draw them. He's babbling pimpy making it up as he goes along to strike the fear of God into the convict before he's shipped away over the sea to a penal colony, one specially built for bird killers, Rocky and remote blasted by gales, screeching gold orcs, guillemots, Sky, cold and gray and hopeless place of penitence. prising barnacles from stone for food, all in Penny's mind, vengeful, eaten away with hatred, teaming visions to hand in the brain. Oh, yes, lustrous pebble head saw that, but he had no idea of PMT and the round the whole man, duck Messiah, goose God, if he's certainly worth reading the biography soon to be a film, but much of what pebble had writes is nonsense. For one thing, pimped he looked absolutely nothing like Anthony Burgess

Here is a simple magic trick to astonish your family and friend when performing it, whereas sweeping black cape and apply some mascara around your eyes. Doing so will add a dash of Mystique and make you seem a little more exotic than you are already. If you have no family and few friends, you can drag some men Dickens and oaklins and dogs off the street. The trick can only be performed on a sunny day. For the begin, you need to position yourself in such a way that you're standing in a shaft of sunlight beaming through your window into an otherwise gloomy room. This shaft of light will make visible motes of dust dancing in the air around you. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a moat as a particle of dust, especially one of the innumerable minute specks seen floating in a beam of light. There are several other definitions of moat, but that's the one I'm talking about. Dust Meanwhile, he's given us earth or other solid matter in a minute and find a state of subdivision so that the particles are small and light enough to be easily raised and carried by a cloud. In a cloud by the wind. any substance can be muted or pulverized powder. Again, the dictionary gives other meanings of dust, including that to which anything is reduced by disintegration or decay, especially the actress as smoldering remains of a dead body. Note that I'm not for one minute suggesting that you should perform this astounding magic trick while engulfed in a cloud of the dust. To which some close relative say your mom or your Wang tubercular sister has recently been reduced. If you are grieving for one not long departed, whether it be your mom or your sister or anybody else, you should probably not be trying to do conjuring tricks, even as a way of perking yourself up. Grief is grief and most run its course, as any number of books in the Self Help section of your local library will tell you even in this day and age. You may search fruitlessly in your library for a work of literature or history or science, but I'm told that the shelves still leave with self help books of all kinds, especially ones with a television tie in. Make sure you're standing within the shaft of sunlight, erect and resolute. Do not hunt your shoulders or slouch and try not to topple over. If you're the sort of person who does tend to topple because you're overwhelmed by the sheer weightiness of existence. shore yourself up with something metal poles. artfully placed can keep even the we deist have numerous Phoenix upright, at least for long enough to perform this trick. Explain to your audience that you're going to astound and amaze them speak in a booming voice resonant with melodrama. If you're incapable of producing sufficiently booming and melodramatic sounds, hire a ventriloquist who can be hidden somewhere within the gloom. Do not be disheartened if any members of your audience chuckle or titter or even guff for that will be a reflection upon them, not upon you. They well I would wager be traveling or twittering or guffawing due to nerves, nerves strain to snapping point in anticipation of the eldritch forces you are about to loose. Meet any laughter with a capital of your own or have your ventriloquist, and make it as fiendish a cackle as you can, but do not overdo it. Now, it can happen, especially in a climate such as as the southern cloud will scatter across the sky and occlude the sunlight, thus, rendering the motes of dust around you much less visible. If your room is sank, in particular gloom, the most Some dust might not be visible at all. And you yourself may be bought a shadow in the Merc and a blurred shadow that to those of your audience whose ocular faculties are pitiable.

It is imperative that you keep their interest until the cloud passes on the shaft of sunlight beans once again upon you without a banjo or a ukulele and launch into an Appalachian folk song, preferably one with innumerable verses, but less than compelling narrative, so that you can play and sing for as long as unnecessary, but break off as soon as the sunlight returns, even in the middle of a verse without disappointing your audience. Some people find it difficult to play stringed instruments while wearing sweeping black capes. I've never quite understood this, but apparently it's something to do with movement of the arms being hampered by the cape. If you're affected by this problem, try tucking the cake behind your back, or pick an Appalachian folk tune that requires only desultory strumming, so that you need not move your arms too much. It might be that the cloud blocking the sunlight is a harbinger of further cloud, even of a completely overcast sky, and that for Rachel downpour will begin that would not be surprising in this land. Now, while such a turn of events may leave You crushed, and in no wise able to perform the astounding magic trick. Due to the lack of a shaft of sunlight beaming through your window. It has the advantage that your audience will almost certainly wish to remain indoors. True, some of them may have come armed with Southwest as a macintoshes and galoshes and be willing to trudge back across the fields in the pelting rain. But the likelihood is that most will stay with you for value and they are in shrouded in gloom, it is at least dry gloom. I assume Of course, that you do not have gaping holes in your roof through which the rain comes in and formed puddles in the depths of your floor. If your repertoire of Appalachian folk songs is scanty, and you have exhausted it before the rainfall ceases, you will need to devise some other form of entertainment for your guests. This is where the ventriloquist, if you have hired one can be a godsend. Even if he or she has not brought their usual dummy with them. It's a simple enough matter to bundle a few rags together into a puppet. While the ventriloquist is keeping your audience spellbound, you can familiarize yourself with a few more Appalachian folk songs using speed learning techniques picked up from a self help book. Between the two of you, it ought to be child play to keep your audience entertained for hours and hours. by which time even in this country, the sun should shine once more. On the other hand, if you have a booming and melodramatic voice, and saw no need to hire a ventriloquist, things might get a bit ugly once your store of Appalachian folk songs has dried up. This is particularly the case if among your audience, you have persons with short tempers low boredom threshold, all those on day release from the nearby secure clinic for the criminally insane. In these circumstances, it will be well if you have borrowed from the library, a self help book such as how to pacify enraged audiences who were expecting a conjuring trick, but was fobbed off with Appalachian folk songs, followed by an eerie silence. But let's be optimistic and hope that the scouting cloud was no more than a fugitive visitor and that the sun shines brightly. Once more. cast aside your banjo or ukulele and make a couple of sweeping gestures with your cape. Ensure as you do so that nobody in the audience gets a glimpse of the Badger concealed within its black fold. Now, ask one of their number to step into the shaft of sunlight with you until then do their hat. On very, very rare occasions, not a single person in the audience will be a hat wearer, but this need not concern you. You will have taken the precautionary measure of planting a stooge with a stovepipe hat among your guests. Should nobody else volunteer. This person now leaps up with enthusiasm yet without betraying that the pair of you are all muckers who go way, way back. You take the stochastic from him, and using sleight of hand, insert the Badger into it.

It's absolutely crucial that no one sees you do this. You then place the hat on your students head and tell him to return to his seat or stall. At this point, do some flummery for a minute or two. Then with an air of distraction, as if it's an afterthought, ask your stooge to take his hat off. To the audience's amazement, he will do so to reveal a badger asleep upon his head. To astound to resounding applause. Go and collect the Badger. Remember that you will need to pump it full of antidote fairly soon to rouse it from the coma induced by the serum with which you injected it earlier. You can then pass your own hat round up turned to collect any coinage which your stand audience wishes to give you in gratitude for so thrilling a magic trick. A proportion of any monies collected should of course, be spent on a treat for the backdrop.

serve as nearly the end of the show. However, before we go, another extract from this Dickey shorter potty brief brief lives. Alexander Gordon Lange, Scottish explorer 1793 to 1826. While struggling through Africa on his way to Timbuktu, Lange enumerated his wounds, to doesn't say the cuts to his head, neck, hands, arms and legs, multiple fractures including his jaw, a split here, a grazed windpipe, and several broken fingers. He had also been shot with a musket ball entered through the hip and went out through the back. In addition, he had caught the plague and had most of his possessions stolen. I am nevertheless doing well, he wrote and hope yet to return to England with much important geographical information. He was murdered a few days later after leaving Timbuktu and I'm going to leave not Timbuktu but the resonance studio now. And thanks once again to john for engineering the show. And coming up Henry Scott Ervin, who is already here, rummaging in his bag which seems to be full of exciting things. And I'm sure you'll find out what they are very shortly. Bye bye.
