Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and I am completely blissed out. drawn show was so groovy. I just I don't know I just feel as if I'm floating in a floating in me. Fog of a fog of fog of something or other. However, I'm gonna slap myself on the forehead. me go and try and get a grip and this is hooting out on the air. So I'm going to read to you for half an hour ish. I remember as if it were yesterday, my very first encounter with Tarleton. He was propping up the bar in a Bayesian dismal drinking den, beetle brown and lanten Jordan babblings, and no one in particular. I sat on a stool beside in order the Spangler and can cashed and listened in to what he had to say. He was only recently back from a harsh, harsh mission in the east, and was worrying like a dog with a sheep at the impossibility of grasping the difference between the Near East, the Middle East and the Far East. What seemed to bother him was that was the location of the Middle East was it clear as Damnit, between the near and the far, placing the near and the far was by no means a simple matter. If you were slap bang in the middle of the Middle East, for example, the Near East and the Far East would be equidistant from where you stood, or SAT, or lay sprawled in a hammock in the blistering noonday sun going mad. When he briefly paused to glug his konkin de hemorrhage, I asked him which East near or middle or far he had been in on his harsh, harsh mission. swallowing the dregs of the fiery look here, he splattered and told me the whole point of a harsh mission was that it was harsh, harsh. I could not disagree with that. I bought him another drink. His tongue did not need loosening, but I was at a loose end, and he seemed to be a man of parts well worth listening to. I was wrong. For the next two hours he gambled on and on and on, without cease trying, but failing to settle the matter of the three east, near and middle and far now and then pulling from his pocket, a crumpled map, hand drawn with a leaky buyer, I want a filthy napkin, on which he had tried, tried and failed, tried again and failed again, like the best or worst of bocchetti ins to hammer home the geography of the east to pin it down definitively so that he would no longer need to think about it. That he said in among his witterings was what he could not stand, that no matter how hard he tried, the East would remain forever beyond his grasp. Eventually, he staggered off to the laboratory to vomit. He had left the napkin map on the counter. idly, I picked it up. I turned it this way and that and then feeling the breath of God on the back of my neck. I crumpled it up and I'm crumpled it and turned it upside down and back to front. I laid it back on the counter and smoothed it out. Down the last of my goose bear crunch. Nixon wrapped my muffler tight about my neck and tottered out into the icy blizzard. As I followed the track two tracks back towards my chalet I heard from inside the bar, a scream at once hysterical and tragic, and unhinged and ecstatic. I lit my pipe as snowflakes fell

Not well the coordinates of the rubbish dump lanten handheld visibility, Stygian pebbles on the foot back collar snug at the neck distant in comprehensible keening the mighty pyramids of ancient Egypt sat is cavort in the forest a galumphing peasant with a pail. The rubbish dump would appear to be not far from the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Crows fly there on the our timetabled track track track, rapid clacs that kind of timetable rain on the pebbles. An orphan choir sings a song. Bob crow Bob crow made out of dough, eat him up with salt and herring. A beef in the crops from an unknown assailant, fleeing in the gutter on All Hallows Eve, pictures of jack girls in synthesis, the seven wonders of another world resurrection. It's scary in the night spades at the ready. Bob Crow, Bob crow. So bailius was a terrible drunkard, a dog sniffing a ditch, frisky terrier, lumbering hound, two dogs then the Colossus of Rhodes, young marble giants wind in the rigging a front with a towel in a doorway like Harry Lyon in postwar Vienna. Wheels within wheels, the windmills of someone else's mind. mind how you go, sir. There's room for one more inside there's room for one more skip at the rubbish dump. Babylon or sharp. Sing sing in a good cedral choir nunc Dimittis and he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. Bob Sparrow, Bob lock.

We are teetering on the brink Let's fall into the abyss. Visibility nil in the Abyss? Can I get a witness? Is there honey? Is there tea? No, you have drained your cup. You could not make it up a new ghost.

Those of you who were listening last week and whose brains haven't been completely blissed out by the groovy music in the preceding show. And may remember that I devoted the entire show to reading the most of the entry for bird in the stiff Thompson motif, index of folk tale motif types or words to that effect. And I'm gonna read a similar similar list now. This is from the arm Thompson types of the folk tale. I think that probably might be the same Thompson but now working with arm instead of with stiff. And I like to do these these kind of long lists. Because a number of readers have told me how helpful readers listeners, number of listeners have told me how helpful they find them in getting their children to fall asleep. So, if you'd like to, if you've got a recalcitrant infant that caterwauling walls instead of falling asleep, and the thing to do is make a recording of this bit of the show, and put it on a thing and tighten. Play it to your plate to your child at bedtime. I'm going to read one to 99 wild animals won the theft of fish to the tail Fisher, three Sham blood and brains for carrying the Sham sick trickster.

Frank Key  15:26
Sorry for the little little hiccup in the middle of that. The other thing I should point out is that I said I was going to read numbers one to 99. And if you were listening very carefully, you'll have noticed a lot of numbers missing. That's because they're not there. I read every entry for wild animals, and we might have a bit more of that later in the show. But for now, oh Prunella, thou art fair. But is it true that there has lost their marbles? Just now I was engaged in breezy chit chat with old grievous the retainer by the Phil but hedge and he said you would take into hiding behind the errors, waving a new dawn sock from your dainty hand, to and fro to and fro while humming a body song. That is why I came bounding across the lawn past the box hedge and the seri rows of our craps and dashed into the house and up the stairs to your boardwalk to find out if greenfish spoke the truth. And now I find you here so fair, not behind the arrows at all, but slumped on a divan, toying with pickles in a jar and by your slipshod feet, another jar sealed in which there appears to be a creature of the sea and brined globular and luminous. The sock you will wafting has been tossed aside against the wind Scott, where it is being ignored by a little mouth that was not singing now, but keening oboe melancholy QiMing redolent of untold centuries of historic wrongs and righted. I shall bring you a Flan from the pantry. Oh my Prunella and then I shall lift you to your feet and carry you all the way to the house of Dr. slop. It is an untidy house dilapidated and falling down, but within the good doctor maintains a laboratory in which he conducted brain servicing experiments. I shall pay him a few Sue's and hand you over to his care until the springtime come Prunella. Dear, let drop your pickle jar. Think no more about the sock. I will take your secret code to the aquarium as soon as I have you safely installed with the doctor. Do not Oh Do not scamper behind the errors where I cannot read you seeing not that body song is a sales my ears and I must stuffed them with cotton wool, greenish greenish Come quick. The Secret jar has broken the seal upon its jar and is slithering across the rug towards the era's Oh God in heaven glob glob glob

fans of HP Lovecraft will have recognized glob glob glob as the words or noises made by some nameless lovecraftian sea creature during a telephone call in the thing on the doorstep and it might be of interest to listeners to know that many years ago now. Ed Baxter the what is he the chief executive of resonance or the the head person of residence at banksters answering machine message used to be glob glob glob anyway back to the sea now or near the sea or next to the sea. You don't expect to find a CAD in a grotto. But that's exactly what I discovered during the spot of seaside spelunking many years ago. I'd abseiled down a cliff having been told by my colleague Dennis pivot, but they was at its foot partly submerged underwater. A Grotto, which he thought was the portal to a magnificent and extensive system of caves never before explored. What makes you think that Dennis, I had asked him as we ate sausages in the seaside cafeteria clues strewn in various rare manuscripts of olden times, he said, when I pressed him for further details, he pretended to be chewing on a piece of gristle, then gagged, spat into a napkin and keeled over. It was a convincing performance. And at the time, I had absolutely no idea he was dissembling. I hired some Katyn headed for the cliff. It was a squale de jowls was screaming their heads off. My ears are over sensitive to certain bird shrieks so I stuffed them with cotton wool. Then I abseiled like the abseiling expert, I am down the cliff face. What would the cotton worland my cushion helmet I couldn't hear a thing. At the bottom of the cliff, I swung myself into the Grotto. I unfastened myself from my abseiling rope and stood for a moment or two knee deep into watching sea water to catch my breath. That is when I saw the CAD II came looming out of the platonic shadows at the back of the Grotto, a dapper fellow in spite of the cheapness of his suit. Like many of postwar CAD, he bought a striking resemblance to the actor Terry Thomas 1911 to 1990 Hello, chap, he said. I say you couldn't see your waiter loaning me a few Bob could you had a run a bad luck on the Old Glory? Jeez, you know how it is. I couldn't hear a word he said. A gesture to indicate as much. Then I took off my helmet and prize the cotton ball out of my ears and asked him to repeat himself. After he done so I explained that I never carried cash when abseiling for fear it might fall from my pocket into the merciless sea. drat, he said, and then offered to play some bets for me. If I met up with him at Waterloo station on the following Thursday, and forwarded him several hundred pounds. I promised to think about it, though, in truth, my puritanical ways made it very unlikely that I would ever get embroiled in any form of gambling. Tell me something I said. You seem to be familiar with this grotto. I've been led to believe it leads to a magnificent and extensive system of caves never before explored. Is that indeed the case? I haven't got the foggiest. He said, only been here a couple of weeks haven't quite got my bearings. This surprised me. I had always thought it a characteristic of calves that they were quick to grasp the possibilities of whatever circumstances they found themselves in. I put this to him without actually calling him a CAD. By way of reply. He changed the subject. I say you couldn't loan me those bits of cotton wool, could you I'm being driven crackers by the shrieking of those damn double goals.

Frank Key  23:43
I was reluctant to relinquish my makeshift ear muffs and told him so I still cannot remember how he managed to wheedle amount of me, nor how he convinced me to let him try on my abseiling harness, which having dawned, he attached to the rope dangling at the grottoes opening, whereupon he rapidly ascended, leaving me alone. The sloshing seawater was now up to my waist. There was nothing for it but to make my way deeper into the Grotto, in the hope of discovering a magnificent and extensive system of caves never before explored. But was my colleague Dennis pivot, right? Or was he talking twaddle? As he so often did. On this occasion, I'm relieved to report he was bang on the money. I spent several days clamoring about underground, the first man to see Oh, such wonders. But when Thursday came, I determined to find my way back to the Grotto, and then somehow up the cliff face. I remembered I had an appointment to meet the cat at Waterloo station, and though I had no intention of giving him several hundred pounds to bet on the horses on my own Half ideally wanted to recreate my abseiling harness and rope and cotton wall. When I got to the Grotto the tide was in and the sloshing seawater came up to my neck without my abseiling gear, I knew I could not hope to scale the cliff. So I decided to plunge ahead and make a swim for it. There was a terrible risk that I would be dashed to pieces on the rocks. Luckily, I managed by dint of advanced swimming techniques to stay my way through the tremendous currents, and by midday, I was panting on a shingle beak. I was exhausted and sudden, and had numerous tiny crustacean beings snagged in my hair. But I was alive. Stopping only for reviving Kappa in a seaside cafeteria. I caught a train to Waterloo station, and they're on the concourse waiting for me. I spotted the cat. I scrolled towards him. There you are all been he said. Have you got a wardrobe the folding stuff? No, I have not. I cried. I am a puritanical bent, and I never bet on the horses. I have come for my abseiling harness and rope and my cotton wall with which I entrusted you in the Grotto. Of course, our boy, of course, he said, a gleam of mystery in his eyes. I put them in a locker for safekeeping here and he handed me a key number 666 Be seeing you and he scarpered. I asked a railway person where the lockers were and went straight to them. I inserted the key into the lock of locker number 666 and open it opened it. There was no sign of my harness my rope and my cotton wall. Instead, what I found in the locker was the thing that had I been known, I would have dropped as surely as one drops a burning potato, for it led to my utter ruin in this world and my damnation in the world to come.

Frank Key  27:39
It's nearly time to go for this week. But just two more things. For younger listeners who may not know what a postwar kads looked like. There's a photograph of Terry Thomas on the hooting yard website at HTTP, colon double slash hooting yard.org. And finally, I've been reading seasons in the sun, the battle for Britain 1974 to 1979 by Dominic Sandbrook, published a couple of years ago, and I don't know why this made me laugh out loud, but it did. Well, I may not have laughed out loud, but I certainly chuckled to myself. I find it highly amusing. And I'm going to read it to you and perhaps you'll find it amusing too. So this is a paragraph from Dominic Sandbrook seasons in the sun. Jeremy Thorpe spent the early weeks of the October 1974 general election campaign on a preposterous hovercraft tour of English seaside resort, providing broadcasters with plenty of pictures of himself struggling ashore in bedraggled oil skins. Why while age taught miserably to restart is unreliable vehicle. Politics was so much more interesting then. Bye bye.
