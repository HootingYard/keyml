We've used Tip Top exciting radio technology, which means you actually have to pay to listen to hooting yell this week. So go to resonance fm.com hit the donate button and make a donation. Because if you don't, all you'll actually be able to hear for the next half hour is the sound of a hideous slimy, semi aquatic lovecraftian sea monster. glob glob glob glob glob glob Go on, go to the go to the website and donate. Otherwise, that's all you're going to get. glob glob glob speaking of things like sea monsters, here's a quotation. I am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship home bird, and writing with button little hope of human eye ever seeing that which I write, for we are in the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea, the timeless sea of the North Atlantic. From the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see spread out to the far horizon, and interminable waste of weed, a treacherous silent, vast attitude of flying and hideousness. That's a quotation from from the timeless see, by William hope Hodgson. 1877 to 1918. He was an author, photographer, sailor and bodybuilder who wrote four novels before concentrating on short fiction, and he was killed in the First World War. HP Lovecraft was an admirer praising his serious treatment of unreality, and the critic Sam Gifford noted his apparently inexplicable choice of writing styles. In an essay entitled, writing backwards, there's a link to that essay on the hooting out website. When I read his first published novel, The boats of the Glen carraig, which I think is 1907 not sure the boats of the Glen Carrick I was struck by something else, apparently inexplicable. The story purports to be an A, and this is the the subtitle, an account of the boats adventures in the strange places of the earth. After the foundering of the good ship, Glenn carried through striking upon a hidden rock in the unknown seas to the southward, as told by john winter strong gent to his son, James winter straw in the year 1757. And by him committed very properly and legibly to manuscript. So what we get is a thrilling yarn where in the narrator recounts coming up coming ashore in the land of lonesome pneus. We found it to be of an abominable flatness desolate beyond all that I could have imagined. In the end, we found a slimy banked Creek, the banks being composed of a vial of mud, and then they head off to an island on a weed choke see where the bulk of the tail takes place. As in from the title of See, the setting is that an interminable waste of weed a treacherous silent vaster truth? Have saliva and hideousness

lurking in the weeds the various disgusting creatures withdraw heroes fight off and out with in between doing boat repairs. But is there any other writer who would take pains to mention every single occasion, his characters break off for a meal until the end, where several weeks action is summarized. The narrative takes us day by day, and Hudson regularly reassures us that the castaways are getting proper meals. I did some basic word count analysis on the novel and Hodgins focus of attention became clear. It is indeed a weed choked book, weed and enticing variants such as the weed continent appear 223 times in a 60,000 word text. Considering that the writer and his curiously anonymous powers spend much time in terror of the various disgusting creatures I mentioned, it's no surprise to find hideous monsters and tentacles, accounting for a total of 51 words yet breakfast, dinner and food when the day with 53 words. And it seems very good to have a path after every meal. Smoke is mentioned 15 times if we turn to Hodgson second novel, The house on the borderland Sure enough, by page three, quote, Tennyson had got the stove lit now and was busy cutting slices of bacon into the frying pan. I hope an enterprising publisher, reissues Hodgins work if one hasn't already done so. But what ideally like to see is the William hope Hodgson recipe book, a boon for any picnic person in a silent Vasa crude of slime and hideousness.

We bundled our picnic things into Gunny sacks and set out upon the road to pox haven. It is a long strike track some say a ley line pitted with many puddles, the road to POC kesavan Oh, where are you going? asked passing peasant. And we replied, We are heading for POC saven and soon enough, through mist and Excuse me. And soon enough, through mist and rain. We saw a signpost and on the signpost scratched it seen by the claws of a werewolf with a word cut pox haven. In centuries past when town and city and countryside were ravaged by the pox, teeming thousands fled to safety along this road to find a haven from the pox in the seaside resort of pox haven. Now, it is for picnic we go to pox Haven, even in mist and rain, you will find no better picnicking spot than among the many many picnic spots of pox haven. There are werewolves to werewolves that roam the streets and valleys and muse of pox haven. In centuries past they fed upon the pox riddled escapees from town and city and countryside who made it as far as pox haven. Now, the werewolf howling hunger when dusk descends upon pox haven. It is a custom and one we follow when our picnic is done to leave for the starving werewolves. A few leftover picnic sausages injected with the pox, a policy side picnic spot in pox haven. As we trudge home along the old straight track in the dusk, we hear the Grateful howling of the sausage gobbling werewolves of pox haven

Kevin pack went up the hill To sing a gorgeous Aria. Cat fell down and broke his crown and peg came tumbling after Kevin pag lay in the muck the foot of the hill with dented heads. They sang a siren song hoping to attract an ambulance with a proper blaring siren. This is a technique known as sympathetic singing. You sing making the sounds of what you wish for. It doesn't always work. But today it did. And Kevin pag, we're halfway through the second verse of their siren song. When along came an ambulance. It's blaring siren drowned out there singing. The paramedics deployed glue and bandages and pills and bundled Kevin pagg into the back of the ambulance. For bureaucratic reasons. They were taken to two different clinics cab to a rustic well being center and peg to a clown hospital. Lying in their beds many miles apart. Kevin pag sang a duet. He could hear the others part through hidden ear pieces. But other patients on their Ward hearing only half a song crew restive and track things at them, hoping thereby to shut them up. The rustic patient showered cab with rotten fruit and vegetables and the clown's truck pails of water over pagg both of them stopped singing. And now all I could hear in there hidden earpieces was a low electronic hum. Kevin pag began to hum in unison, but this serves to exasperate the second recuperating rustics and clowns even further. The rustics rang their bells, and the clowns pop their Hooters to summon brutes who turfed Kev out of the rustic well being center and pack out of the clown hospital more or less instantaneously. The thing is sat with bandaged heads on pathways many miles apart. They struck up another Jew ate a gorgeous one, and began tentatively to make their ways towards each other. Both had head injuries and was somewhat disorientated and discovered as they staggered along their pathways that their sense of balance had been affected, and they kept toppling over. Eventually, the strain of singing and moving at the same time became too much. Kev lay down to rest in a ditch and pagg found a park bench upon which to sprawl. They fell silent there, earpieces harmed, unknown either to calf or pag. The humming of their earpieces was picked up by a bloxom unmasked towering over a top secret national security facility, a cluster of deceptively ramshackle huts surrounded by a tall wire fence. It took an operative sat at his scanner in one of the hearts near seconds to locate precisely calves ditch and pags park bench. mere seconds later, a gate in the fence buzzed open, and a pair of bulky armored vehicles tremble loud, their drivers taking them in opposite directions. They picked cab up first, he was asleep, and they injected him with a serum tuition to ensure he did not wake pag proved less tractable. He had dosed but was woken by Birdsong, and when they came to get him he was clowning around, still bandaged. Still disoriented. He tried to escape their clutches by doing pratfalls on banana skins, they had to taser him. Kevin pag were held in separate but adjoining rooms in a subterranean part of the facility. Their hidden ear pieces were removed and taken to a lab for analysis. data was extracted and transferred to old fashioned magnetic tape. The resulting recordings were then piped into their separate holding cells through Huge loudspeakers sat on stools provided with beakers of vitamin enhanced tap water cab was made to listen to pag, and pag to cab.

Frank Key  15:14
First, I heard a gorgeous Aria. But at the control desk in the blocky light nerve center, a sinister operative began a series of tape manipulations he had learned from various argumentative German composers in the 1950s. Kevin pagg heard each other backwards at double speed, with distorted pitch and with all sorts of other modifications, and always as a running undertone, that electronic hum their brains were already dislodged from their tumbling down the hill, and the tape recording so if they need to arrange them further, on day six, when they were taken out of their holding cells, both Kevin pag so outwardly right as rain, their bandages removed, what inwardly do Lally? It was, at this point, they were taken back to the foot of the hill, and injected with a serum that put them back to sleep. When they awoke in the muck, they would remember nothing. They're tumbling. They're broken crowns, the paramedics, the clinics, the rustics, and clowns and rotten fruit and vegetables and piles of water, and the top secret facility, the manipulated tape recordings, all forgotten. calf woke first and shock pag to wake him to they rub their heads in consternation and perplexity rather than from any physical cause. I am not sure where we are, sang, Kev, gorgeously but I feel curiously impelled, impel go impelled trolley trolley to go to Dallas, Texas. Me too. Me too. Me too. Sang pag equally gorgeously. I shall take a mannlicher carcano snipers rifle with me to the Texas School depository sang calf, and I shall keep watch holding an umbrella upon the grassy knoll folder roll sang pag. And so and so the pair set out on their journey, and they climb every mountain and forward every stream singing their hearts out. Oh, so gorgeously on the 22nd of November 1963.

I'm suffering from a spiritual malaise on soul sec. I haven't eaten any breakfast. I need to down a hole in the sleeve of my jumper but I have no further wool that matches. I feel inconsequential and abandoned and remote. My cheeks blush furiously with an embarrassment born of pity. Every last pencil I have a blunt I'm being driven crackers by my landlord drooling hound. My senses are atrophied, like a muscle unexercised. pots and pans are strewn haphazardly in my kitchen. My legs have given way I have an evil taste in my mouth. Hope is something for other people. Not for me. My tea pot is crazy. To the cozy is stained and threadbare. Nervous spasms can talk my features I keep to the shadows if I have to move in the street. Do you hear that sound? It is my groan of despair. I have extinguished all the lanterns and I know in my cold base heart that they will never be lit again. The air is heavy with menace and all I can hear is the screaming of desolation and ruin. insect swarm about my face, but I cannot summon the energy to swat them away. I've sprained my ankle. Dust lies everywhere, ashes and dust. desire. Desire for me is not even a memory. feral cats hiss at me and extend their claws. Even my poultry is contaminated. All sense of urgency is lost. And yet I cannot relax. My head is swimming. My shoes are getting rain water and my socks are soaking wet. The washbasin is cracked. The taps no longer work. Even the most innocent and cherubic children spit at me a gag on my own wretchedness. And then, with a mighty effort, I pulled myself up and I tried to cross Bulgaria like a whip cooker. And I go to the central post office building in Plovdiv. And I look at do Yogi Bhajan loves mural. Yes, that do Yogi Bhajan live, whose nickname was salona or elephant, a member of the so called Plovdiv fivesome. I gaze at his post office mural, and somehow I am pulled back from the brink and I embrace life again, wholeheartedly, blissfully. Such is the power of art, such as the power of the Plovdiv, five thumb.

Frank Key  22:46
I just should reassure you that the Plovdiv fivesome and the Yogi Bhajan live do exist, as does the post office mural in Plovdiv. And speaking of things that actually happen as opposed to twaddle, so sudden and unexpected was Pope Benedict abdication this week that I was caught on the hop and haven't had time to prepare keys patterned pontiff prognosticator. Without it, it's hard to see how on earth as it is in heaven, the Conclave of Cardinals will arrive at a proper decision. I've already received a few phone calls from certain Red Hats begging me for guidance. at such short notice and not having had time to familiarize myself with all the holy candidates. The best I can do is to hope that they elect someone of the same caliber as Eugenio pacelli, the man who became Pope Pius the 12th. Porcelli had the right stuff for a pontiff. The order that anyone in the clergy who was on the other end of the telephone to him should kneel throughout the conversation. The gardeners in his private garden, were instructed to hide in the bushes as he walked past so he wouldn't have to look at them. Having like all, Cardinals take sworn an oath of poverty. He drove around in a huge limousine, with no chairs in the back, just a large throne. He also seems to have regarded himself as an expert on all manner of subject. Here's a quote from john Cornwell 1999 book, Hitler's Pope, The Secret History of Pius the 12th. If he showed signs of grandiosity, it was in his tendency to expatiate on an ever expanding range of topics, so numerous and so beyond his competence with these specialized talks, or Alex tutions the practice seemed symptomatic of ripening delusions of omniscience. He lectured visiting groups on subjects such as dentistry, gymnastics, gynecology, aeronautics, cinematography, psychology, psychiatry, agriculture, plastic surgery, and the art of newscasting. A visitor to his study once remarked on the piles of fat manuals around his desk. Petrelli responded that he was preparing a talk on gas central heating. When TS Eliot, arguably the leading English language poet and literary critic of his day came to the Vatican for a private audience in 1948, Petrelli delivered him a lecture on literature. I'm sure there must be a cardinal among the current gaggle if that's the correct collective noun with similar chops. Let us pray it is so

Frank Key  26:29
