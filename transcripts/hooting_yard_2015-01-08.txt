This is resonance 104 point four FM My name is Frankie and this is the love explosion. Sorry, That's not right. I better start again, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frankie. And this is hooting yard on the air. Let's be sensible for a moment. And over the past few weeks I've been following an intriguing flurry of correspondence in the readers letters section of bestie or granting magazine. It began back in October, the yellow month with a query from a certain Mr. P x pics, who wrote I've been trying to obtain a map of pointy town without success. Can any of your readers point me in the right direction? In the next issue, there were several replies, but most of them were facetious. They suggested plenty of directions in which Mr. pics might point himself, but the respondents were just having a spot of fun. The only sensible letter came from someone who described themselves in an unpublished addendum as an official pointy town tour guide. It's worth mentioning here, that such a position does not exist, as the only known tour guides in pointy town are resolutely unofficial and proud of being so but let that pass. This unnamed correspondent lady not unreasonable point that Mr. pics needed to divulge his own location before anybody could hope to have a clue in which direction he should be pointed, in order to face either pointy town itself, or a kiosk where he might make a purchase of a map of their of the Eddie tricks of bestie or grunting, awarded this letter five stars and rightly so. The following week, a letter appeared undersigned Mrs. p x picks grieving relict of Mr. P x picks alongside the printed typeset version of the letter, a photograph of the original was reproduced, showing the smudges occasioned during its composition by Mrs. Pixies fall in tears, the better for readers to appreciate her grief. The widow explained that her late husband had dutifully followed the sundry pieces of advice given by the facetious or better writers in the previous issue, but that in pointing himself in dozens of different directions at great speed, he had become dizzy in the head, and toppled over and fallen into a pit of vipers. he happened to be standing next to the time. Mrs. PICT added the play that she herself now sought advice on obtaining a map of pointy town, as it was her dearest wish that her husband be buried, clutching said map in his cold dead white hands. As soon as the authorities had devised a method of safely extricating his corpse from the Viper pit. She did not divulge her location. Her letter was not awarded any Stars by the editor rates. By the time the next issue of the magazine appeared, it was November, the month of chrysanthemums. Much of the letters page was taken up with protest that Mrs. pics had not been given any stars. Several readers threatened to cancel their subscriptions unless this injustice was corrected. The editor devoted a full page elsewhere in the issue to a carefully argued piece explaining her decision. Stars she wrote, were not awarded lightly, and she was damned if he was going to cave in the to the demands of her more petulant readers who misunderstood the protocol. The article was accompanied by a photograph of the letters editor, plucking a star from the night sky, preliminary to affixing it to the print ready page. eagle eyed readers would have noticed, buried beneath all the letters of protest. A further letter from the SWAT diesel official pointed town tour guide. He wrote that he was drew to meet a mysterious Contact are at a crossroads at midnight, who dangled before him the possibility that he, the contact might identify a kiosk where a map of pointed town could be obtained, though, only for rental rather than purchase outright.

I missed the next issue of bestie or grunting by dint of illegible God alone knows what happened. But in the fortnight since I bought a copy, the magazine had changed utterly. It was now called New bestie or grunting. The editor Rick's had become the editor in chief. The letters editor had been demoted to Office janitor, and the readers letters page had vanished. In its place was a sheet of burnt and blackened paper, giving off a distinct whiff of sulfur. When I tried to return the magazine to the newsagent thinking it might just be a faulty copy. Sorry. When I tried to return the magazine to the newsagent thinking it might just be a faulty copy. I found his kiosk shuttered and boarded up daubed with the sign of the cross

could always be connected in some way to the data Mr. pics, and the quick misses pics and their desire to obtain a map of pointy town. I had to concede the possibility. I determined at once standing in a puddle next to the abandoned kiosk to pay Mrs. pics a visit and interrogate her under Clyde lights if necessary. But then I realized that neither she nor her late husband had ever revealed they were about, like pointy town itself. She was unmapped and I was lost.

That article was awarded one star by Mavis hand basin, the editor in chief of new bestie on grunting

puny, neurasthenic cadet Vig was on Sentry duty outside for 24 points, when an angel of the Lord appeared unto him 12 points. cadet Vig crumbled in terror. Two points. The angel of the Lord appeared to be perplexed. It opened its ring binder, and looked carefully at the weedy cadet, and then at its paperwork, and then it could get vague again, and then back to its paperwork, and it's brown farrowed. For the purposes of its earthly visitation, the angel had made use of a hole punch and inserted all its paper into the ring binder. Normally, when shimmering in its celestial holes, the angel had each individual sheet affixed to a wall with drawing pins. The mass of papers spread out for visual proof, as is the practice with serial killers in television dramas. six points you are puny numerous scenic and outside of Ford said the angel. It says here you should be stately plump and inside a Martello tower cadet vague did not know what to say in response. So he merely quaked two points. Well, nevermind said the angel slamming shut the ring binder. What fort is this? fort hoity said cadet vague truthfully. The angel reopened its ring binder. One point rummaged through the papers, found the entry for cadet vague and said, according to my record, you are meant on this day at this hour to be on century druzy. At Fort toity, eight points. cadet Vig was on the point of swooning, his legs turned to jelly as he realized that yet again, he had misread the duty roster, Captain nitti would be feeding ureas 10 points. The milk sock cadet had an awful vision of months stretching ahead doing potato peeling punishment. How long he wondered? Would it take him to cross the Erie marshes to Fort toity? Could he get there before Captain nitti discovered his mistake? He had a sudden bright idea. Is it in your power? He asked the angel of the Lord to transport me instantaneously to the century post outside outside fort toity far away across the Erie marshes, so I will not get into one of my pickles with Captain nitti. The angel once again consulted the content of it ring binder. six point yes, it said eventually, that is well within my power. But I am minded instead on this starry starry night to shower you. cadet Vig with teaming thousands name millions of points more points than any cadet I'm the captain of each command has ever been awarded. Now cadet Vig did swoon he crumbled to the ground next to the century box outside fort hoity. As he lay there, robbed of consciousness, innumerable golden shining points rained down upon him. And when he woke, the angel of the Lord had vanished, and stars gritted across the boundless firmament. And here, clanking towards him in full armor came Captain nifi. His face purple with rage, his eyes like burning coals, to point and cadet Vig, for the first time in his puny life, was not afraid. He cocked his blunderbuss and took aim at Captain nitti. He had millions of points. That story accumulated a total of 53 points if I have tallied them correctly.

It's 2015. Now and Christmas is two long weeks ago. But of course, resonance has been our lease hooting yard on the air has been off air during that time. So there's a couple of Christmas based things I need to catch up on. One of my readers wrote to ask me if, as one of the world's leading ornithologist, I would be tucking into a bird packed Christmas dinner. Specifically, he wondered if I might be tempted by grupo de la Lennie years 1807 concoction the roti song Pele. Those of you who don't know what our rottie song Pele is, I'll give you the recipe. It's a busted stuffed with a turkey stuffed with a goose stuffed with a pheasant stuffed with a chicken stuffed with a duck stuffed with a guinea fowl stuffed with a tail stuffed with a Woodcock stuffed with a partridge stuffed with a plover stuffed with our lapwing stuffed with a quail stuffed with a thrush stuffed with a lock stuffed with an auto land bunting stuffed with a garden warbler stuffed with an olive the package Castro gnome did not actually recommend washing this down with a brimming tumbler of fresh warm starlings blood, but that would be appropriate. But I didn't have that for my Christmas dinner. In an act of right on cultural outreach to our non Christian pals in the Middle East. I instead had holes stuffed camel. There is a recipe for whole stuffed camel on the hooting yard website which you can read at your leisure. But yes, and the The other thing about Christmas dinner is it was pointed out to me that the phrase Christmas dinner is in fact an anagram of cram, cram. cram turns in dish So that's what I did. And I got a dish and I got some turns. And I cram them in, and then you serve it like that. That was it. But enough about Christmas with art, it's a question I often ask myself, usually when tucking into a plate of smokers Pop Tarts or other breakfast based snack food. I like to get art out of the way very early on in the day, freeing up my time for higher things. I don't practice art myself, but it's a subject of abiding interest to me. Without art, I asked myself, wondering where it will go. To answer that question, well must of course be familiar with where art has been. One follows its trajectory trajectory, from the earliest cave painting to the latest. talentless derivative didactic Marxist video installation bollocks, and one tries to push the line further along to see whence it leads. Every morning breakfast. Sometimes I'll ask those smokers Pop Tarts are just too damn delicious. And the brain that ought to be cogitating upon the future of art, is instead been numbed in a lovely haze of gustatory bliss. At such times, all thoughts of art flyaway like onto a flock of starlings. And instead, I ponder the sheer genius of modern breakfast snack food manufacturing processes. But the next morning, after a day devoted to the higher things, things such as prayer, and beekeeping, and shove hate me, I returned to that burning question with an art as a dog returns to its vomit, and I wrestled with it, at least until breakfast is digested. Very occasionally, when, for example, I have a stomach upset, I do not ask with an art, but instead declaim in a booming voice with art. I curse art and I envision a glorious new world where art curdled and shriveled until it lasted is gone. All of it forever. But of course, we know full well. All that truly with us. It googie 1917 to 2011

excuse me slightly longer break than usual where because I'm getting in a faff about something. One final thing about Christmas. I had a Christmas memory. And it was in the year 1983 that I spent Christmas in Manchester with the ex Mrs. Key and her sister and her husband, her sister's husband, a Mexican anthropologist with a particular interest in textiles. That's not relevant to the current anecdote, but I thought I'd throw it in. Anyway, we were all young and I can be right on in a very 1980s wave. Which is why we thought very carefully before buying our Christmas crackers. Not for us the crass commercialism of the masses with their false consciousness and weird tendency to vote for the hated cetera. Now, we would make the purchase of our Christmas crackers, a political gesture. We bought them from cn D. Oh how we failed to laugh around the Christmas dinner table. As we pulled our ideologically sound crackers. Out fell we expected paper hat and printed slip. And on the latter. There was not a terrible and groan worthy joke, but a sobering Facts about nuclear weapons and the inevitable worldwide Holocaust they would cause. We donned our paper hats and read out these visions of mass destruction, snogging our righteous smug in our righteousness. Then we ate and drank our fill, and had precisely the same kind of Christmas as a lump and proletariat with a despised.

The apothecaries mute. Oh, is he dead then? he is, he is dead and buried according to the tenets of the Church of which he was a member, the tremendously fanatical brotherhood of Christ bloody wounds. The protocols of this sect require that the corpse of the deceased be pierced with no fewer than 20 knitting needles and stuffed into a burlap sack along with a lozenge of gutta percha, and a sprinkling of talc. The sack fastened with safety pins, and tossed down are well at midnight. Such was the end of Oulu. Then I was there, I witnessed his burial, I saw his corpse rattled by scrofulous Bobo's yet still recognizable as the Oulu. Ven I had met on many occasions, on my visits to the apothecary. I saw him pierced and stuffed into a sack, and I saw the sack fastened and tossed down a well. The well was one of my own. I have several wells on my property, none of them productive. I was happy not to say desperate to accept a fee from the Brotherhood for the use of one of my wells for the burial of their fellow. What measure of man was he Ulu, then this mute. I do not mean his physical measurements, which would be of no interest to anybody. And in any case, would sooner be redundant, as his mortal remains shriveled and rotted within the sack of death. Take a tape measure to him a year hence, and your readings will differ violently from any taken moments before he was stuffed into the sack violently. Now, what I mean is the measure of him in moral terms. Oulu ven was meant and he was hapless. He had a great love of budgerigars both as pets and snacks. Some budgerigars he coddled his pets for months on end before strangling them and roasting they're still warm bodies on his little buggy spit. Then he would transfer the roasted bird to a plate, tuck a napkin around his neck and make quick work of it with a knife and fork washing it down with a can of squelch show. Afterwards, he would belch and rinses plates and cutlery under a spigot and toss the empty squelch Oh can down or Well, sometimes this was one of my disused wells. I turned a blind eye, not difficult for me, as I am blind in one eye and have limited vision in the other, not unlike Charles Ford towards the end of his life. After all those hours spent in libraries, poring over newspapers and scholarly journals. That is not the reason for my own occluded vision. I have never set foot in a library in my life. My own near blindness is another predatory condition for which I blame my father's side of the family. It is said a distant forbear offended the king and in his anger the king cursed my ancestor j under several generations. Oulu van was not blind but he was mute. The apothecary found this an exceedingly useful trait for reasons I have not been able to ascertain. Nor have I attempted guesswork. What would be the point Oulu venv is dead now at the bottom of one of my wells, and the apothecary has a new mute, unmute with a lantern draw and a spiteful demeanor. Oh, so unlike sweet tempered Ooh, then there is a budgerigar perched on my window sill, I feed it breadcrumbs and pour a little puddle of sculpture into a dent for it to lap. I do this in memory of Hulu, then every morning, and though I cannot see them. I know that out there. across my field. The tremendously fanatical brotherhood of Christ bloody wounds are gathered in a ring around one of my wells. And they are teaming, teaming, and will continue to keen until the cows come home. But the cows now a far far away and pointing in the wrong direction. And they may never come home again.
