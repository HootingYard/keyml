I like this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frankie. And this is hooting out on the air. And it's a rather frazzled Mr. Key greeting you today live. I don't want to be too Metropolitan about this. But there's a troop strike in London, which means the buses are like a vision of hell. And I have just arrived in fact, I arrived about 40 seconds before you heard my voice. And yes, Well, anyway, we ended last week. Last week, I was reading through your story entitled, a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and diverse at least I think that's the title. And we but such a long story that I completely misjudged the time and there's quite a bit of it to go. So I'm going to read you the end of that story. For those of you who weren't listening. Basically all you need to know is that there was a woman called prudence foxglove in the 19th century, who collected newspaper and magazine clippings about bufflehead and stuffed them into pillows, which she rented to peasants. I'm gonna read I ended with the the last paragraph I read last week I will begin with this week. Throughout this blizzard of editorial activity, prudence continued to put out cut out clippings about buffleheads and send them to drew seven, who had been charged with stuffing them into burlap, Gunny sacks and collecting the pillow rent from the gardener's. It is curious that not a single cutting was ever taken from proven his own magazine. One can search through the bound volumes and never once find the word bufflehead whereas the names of other types of ducks Turn up frequently, particularly shelled rates, which were an obsession. obsessional interest of Baxter's no matter what he was meant to be writing about. Although she did not wholly neglect her own work during these years, penning a so called pneumatic romance and a study of the beards of Victorian intellectuals. prudence had yet to hit upon the formula that she would make her own. The germ of that first groundbreaking play was a walk she took through a patch of broken ground in the shadow of a grim mill one Sunday. She chanced upon a derelict, sloshing a bottle of terps and babblings himself and approached him with a charitable toughens, you know, outstretched hand. The human wreckage grabbed at her wrist, and would not let go. And prudence realized with an awful Pang, that it was her boarding house CAD his manners were no longer exquisite, and his morals will no longer even have the sewer, for they had been utterly blasted away through strong drink and turpentine. She had him carted off to an asylum, in the hope that he would one day recover and visited in there on subsequent Sundays. I'm sorry, unvisited Nair on subsequent Sundays. Listening to his incoherent jabbering as he told his story, from the despair of prison to the greater despair of the broken ground in the shadow of the grim nail. She felt impelled to share this terrible tale with the world, and it became the basis of her play. The dashing buddy borscht CAD and his descent into another world of turpentine fueled depravity. 1890 for writing it, she realized her inborn talent for dramatic dialogue, stage directions, interludes of knockabout comedy, emotionally wrenching climaxes and daring modernist interventions, the latter having something back to drusillas piano and chordal techniques

Frank Key  07:30
from the very first performance, in which the legendary actor manager so Hector bombast, played the dashing but divulged CAD, the play left its audience stand. prudence foxglove had found her Muse and our future was assured.

Frank Key  07:57
She returned the reins of the magazine to then our partially recovered CAD and headed back to her a state, where her many decrepit gardeners and her drugged welcomed her as a heroin drucilla to was overjoyed diver sister back for she had grown lame and the weekly traipsing down from heart to heart to collect the pillow rent had become a sore trial too. There was a folly next to a ha in the grounds of the estate, and prudence took into her writing room. The place poured out of her on an almost daily basis, and soon enough, her dramas were being put on in every theater in the land.

Frank Key  08:45
Thus it was that come the summer she decided to take a break. One fine Friday afternoon she took delivery of a set of sandbags and wheeled them in a Barrow around the garden, those hearts retrieving each of her burlap Gunny sacks, and leaving a sandbag in its place. Then holed up in her folly by the ha ha. She emptied out the sacks and laborious Lee copied out each and every bufflehead related clipping into a series of exercise books. When she was done, she took the horse and cart to the village post office and send the in bundled books to a printer. A month later, she received via either pneumatic funnel system, thousands of copies of a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and song. Unlike her plays, it was not a success. The public had come to expect from her stern moral invective, drunken brutes, comedic draped crippled orphans, vapid revellings, pugilistic Vickers and daring modernism. None of these was to be found in what was after all, just a forbiddingly fat anthology of miscellaneous About ducks. When prudence foxglove died in 1922, all but one of the copies was found rotting and packing cases in the cellar of her estate, and that single presumably sold copy. The story is told that its owner, a grandnephew of Hicks had in Eagle luggage. When he stepped aboard the airship Hindenburg in Frankfort on the Third of May 1937.

Frank Key  11:22
I'm still feeling rather frazzled. So if I collapse in a physical heap of physical wretchedness, not unlike the debauch CAD but for reasons other than debauchery. During the next piece, you'll just have to twiddle your thumbs or something.

chunk theory is the theory that everything can be crumbled into chunks, the data is apprehended, meaning, chunks are very different to say lumps or clumps or crumbs or bits. Am I certainly never been mistaken for smithereens. The proper definition of the trunk is given in the standard work on trunk theory, trunk theory a primer, by the theories original or theorize a good Gustav trunk. trunk was of course not the name he was born with. It is a pseudonym hit upon, I hit upon the better to identify himself with the theory he propounded when it was not writing about Trump's trunk, busying himself, destroying all trace of his true surname, so successfully that today, we know him only as trunk and do not have an atom of evidence regarding his real name. There is even some doubt as to whether or not his first name was Gustav. But as the parlance of today has it, let's not even go there. trunk was fond of demonstrating the beauty of his theory by physically crumbling things into trunks, even things that do not readily lend themselves to crumble meant faced with such a thing. A public telephone kiosk, for example, trunk had no qualms about deploying hacksaws axes, large heavy hammers, and similar tools in order to affect his goal. He could regularly be seen marching about his town, smashing things to bits, although when challenged, he would protest that he was engaged in the assisted crumbling of things into trunk. And boy, oh boy, was he challenged, he made innumerable complaints that he was being followed about by municipal cohesion officials and coppers, arguing that such stalking was a form of entrapment. Much of the primer was written in the waiting rooms of various courts and assizes, where a chunk was due to face sanction. He was the kind of man who tended to topple over when shoved with sufficient force, and this led him to refine his theory in later years. shoving and toppling would be incorporated alongside crumble, and chunks without doing damage to the premises of the original theory, save the sort of collateral damage one might expect. How it would all have held together is something we can only guess that for the promised second edition of the private never appeared, chunk himself with kg whenever he was asked about it, which was seldom as very few people, very, very few people remotely interested in his work. one chunk is commentator client That only four copies of the primer were ever sold each of them to Crowley's with whom chunkies to hang around in the streets of his town, laden with axes and hammers and slicers. eyeing up likely targets for assisted crumbling. But there are other concussed commentators who have radically different views. Indeed, the most intriguing feature of our business is that chunkiest commentators, disputant devotees, fellow travelers and hangers on vastly outnumber the total number of people who've ever even laid eyes on a copy of the primer, let alone read the damn thing. This signal factors led to an offshoot of trunk theory, though there's trunk theory theory, a field which has spawned an entire academic industry, populated by bat good for nothings, who would be better employed digging drainage ditches, some of whom apparently actually do such drainage ditch digging in between penning abstruse articles for the numberless chunk theory theory journals.

Frank Key  16:14
I went to interview one sack peasant scholar for this thesis, but when I approached him, he shoved me with considerable force and I toppled into the drainage ditch here just completely digging, Sartre the perils of academe, I brush them aside for I am both hoity toity, and I know where the bodies are buried. My father was a grave digger, and his father before him, and they knew not only where the bodies were buried, but on which side their bread was buttered, and they knew their onions too. You will rarely find a peasant scholar chunkiest or otherwise, who knows such things. I was minded to follow the family grave digging tradition, but I proved too weedy to handle a spade. Ironic I suppose that I end up flailing helplessly on my back at the bottom of a drainage ditch. While I chunky starts to shoveled chunks of crumbled Earth over me, like I seen from a tree horror film. But I shall abide, though I crumble to dust Dustin crumbled chunks at an each crumble chunk, a worm that borrows

magnet boy, the boy magnet magnet boy, the boy magnet. Most magnetic cartoon character of the atomic age was the brainchild of a washed up has been called Lamont Pinochet yet as with his namesake, the brutal Chilean dictator, Pinochet surname was mispronounced as Pinochet by all and sundry. I have a hot tea like Turin dot the cartoonist used to shout slumped in the gutter as he often was before the late flowering success he found with his magnetic hero. Even after that success, he spent much of his time in the gutter. He had grown familiar with it and felt comforted by the proximity of drains. It he said that once when he was in the gutter, Pinochet got embroiled in a terrific argument with a passer by who insisted that general Augusto Pinochet himself pronounced his name Pinochet and that Jacomo PTV, specifically intended to run.to be pronounced Toronto like cartoonist with by this time so washed up that he could barely summon the energy to respond. But it was the one thing he felt fierce about. So he inhaled the fumes from the nearest drain and gave his opponent a verbal battering I have my doubts that this incident can be true. For at the time the Chilean would have been a youngster, and not yet a general, an unknown on the world stage. Be that as it may, there is something uplifting in the picture of the bedraggled cartoonist dressed presumably in rags, gathering his wits in a Windsor tea gathering way and demanding his final tea be spoken aloud. Which of us can be sure we would have such gumption, even if it seems to be a trivial thing to get into a lather about? junction of course is the quality we most readily associate with magnet boy, the boy magnet together with perkiness and magnetism, in all his adventures set in the fictional city of magnet Ville. Battling evil doers and outwitting communists. magnet boy, the boy magnet shows such incredible levels of gumption that even as we cheer him on, we fret about his health. How is it we ask that such as a little trap, or be one whose physical form takes the shape of a snub nosed perky head atop a large horseshoe magnet can display such gumption week in week out? without falling prey to the sort of debilitating weakness and neurasthenia that put Edgar Allan Poe in his grave at the age of 40. Ah, but then we remind ourselves that magnet boy the boy magnet is fictional and does not suffer the world the buffets that the set Poe and we are relieved. But while Glee buffets certainly the set magnets boy, the boy magnets creator Lamont Pinochet even before he found himself in the gutter, curled up by drains, he had been thrown from horses, trapped in the mountains, buried alive, stranded on a beach, pursued by bears, ravaged by toxins, imprisoned for tomfoolery shoved in front of an express train, attacked by irredentist. smothered by pillows, punched by a pig farmer, locked in a cubicle, spat at by Mormons, burned in the sun, plagued by wet lows, Bled by cupping, tarred and feathered and pelted with pebbles. He had also repeatedly hat is is syringed by charlatans. He faced each and every one of these outrages with whining and self pity, crawling ever further down a moral slope towards degradation and disgust.

Frank Key  23:02
And yet, always time over scribbling his cartoons on scraps of paper on the backs of fat packets on his own forehead. Somehow, none of these earlier creations ever caught the public imagination, imagination, or even penetrate own imagination. There was a strip based on the more impenetrable essays of john Ruskin, there was a plethora of chat books, featuring a talking salary stick called Drax. But because Drax came from another salary dominated planet, he's spoken space gibberish. There was a character called unconscious squirrel, a squirrel that was unconscious, penetrate plugged away, trying out each and every idea that popped into his head, no matter how stupid and all while the gutter beckoned. The gutter, the gutter. The gutter that miraculously inspired magnet boy, the boy magnet. Oh, how I would love to reproduce just one tiny picture of my cartoon hero. But I cannot afford to do so is forbidden in his last will and testament done in cartoon strip form. Lamont Pinochet declared that with his death, all trace of his life on earth be wholly and utterly obliterated. I shall be expunged, sings his alter ego, a singing a sink, a singing ringing carpet beetle. And so it came to pass

Frank Key  25:18
Although he appeared there in fictional guys, magnets, boy, the boy magnet was in fact a genuine cartoon character created by me in about 1979. There was magnet boy, the boy magnet. And there was another cartoon strip called Hank hairdryer, the human hairdryer. The thing about magnet boy was, as described in that story. He was one of those kind of horseshoe magnets with a little head on top. And Hank hairdryer, the human hairdryer was a normal human figure with a collar and tie, but in place of a human head was a kind of hairdryer with a pair of eyes. And yes, interesting. Perhaps that's why I'm not a professional cartoonist to this day. But they were fun to draw at the time when I used to draw. I think that's about it. For this week, I'm slightly less frazzled. JOHN, the engineer kindly gave me a glass of water from which I've been sipping during the show, which means I'm possibly able to stagger out of the studio at the end of the show, which is imminent, imminent, in fact, so imminent that it's about to happen. So I hope you've enjoyed this rather frazzled edition of voting out on the air, which is overused that F word, the one with two Zed in it, but I'm not gonna worry about that. I'm gonna go lie down I think Bye bye.
