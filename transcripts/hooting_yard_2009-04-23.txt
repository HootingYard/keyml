strangle a pig and burn down the barn and dosey doe your partner's. It was a rallying cry, and in its wake pigs were strangled barns were burned and dosi goes where essayed how sweet the memory of those dances of my grandparents youth. I was not alive then of course, so I have no direct memory. But I recall as an infant sitting in a basket slung over one of grandpa's bison, and he goading the beast along the lane, and telling me tales of his childhood in the Vatican blat the strangled pigs and the burning bonds and the dos idos. He told me how here my grandma methods to rally the one with a bale of straw and the other with a can of paraffin, and how they kissed as they said a barn ablaze and clamber to safety over the corpses of pigs and dosey doe in the light of the flames. It is another world now, pig protection teams stand guard over the size and bounds are built from fireproof panels. And the dosey doe is classed as a criminal act, the penalty terrible. It is perhaps a more civilized world, even here in the Vatican blat but though I know it only from my grandparents stories, still I missed that rustic mayhem. There is a hole where my soul should be. I wander past the pigsty and beat my fists upon the table of the band. And very, very quietly, so I will not be overheard. I put my lips together and whistle a tune from the old pneumatic hoedown. Oh later and mad and giddy tune. Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. That was a piece of rustic nostalgia. And on with the rest of the show. Yes, voting out on the air 30 minutes or there abouts of pros. And here's some more. On Sunday just gone. For the first time since mid December last year. There was no posting the hooting yard website. I'm sure you've already visited but if you haven't It's www dot hooting yard.org and there had been a posting every day since the 16th of December 2008. But there was nothing on Sunday. And so the next day when I leaped out of bed at 515 and went to the ablutions pod to submerge my head in icy water. I wonder if I should proffer an apology to my readers for this dereliction. But when I reflected head still submerged on the unexpectedly trying day I'd had it seemed clear to me that far from apologizing, it would be more appropriate to whimper in a bid for sympathy. What had promised to be an average April Sunday became a nightmare of mishaps catastrophes and disasters, which left me with no opportunity whatsoever to tap gubbins into my blog. First of all, before I lifted my head out of the bucket, I was reaching blindly for my towel, and inadvertently knocked over a jar of grease, the lid lid of which had not been fastened properly, with the result that some of the grease spilled onto the floor and formed up small puddle in which Skippy slipped as he came bounding and barking into the ablutions pod, as he usually does when he senses that I'm up and about ravenous he as he is, for a bowl of reconstituted meat chunks in jelly, and in slipping Skippy, huge of bulk, bashed right into my bucket, which clumps me on the side of my head, or more specifically on my ear, before falling over so that the icy water it held splashed all over the floor, some of it dripping through slits in the planks onto the wiring beneath, causing a short circuit, which knocks out all the electrical power, not only in my hub, but in the entire building. There are reasons I think why wiring is tucked away behind whines, cuts and floorboards and walls, partly because it's inherently dangerous, and partly because it makes sense to keep it hidden from people like me, who have no understanding of it, but who might be tempted to fiddle with it as a way of passing the time. Even though I've was temporarily temporarily deaf in one ear, and my head was soaking wet,

I resolved to dislodge one of the planks so I could with my towel, dab at the wet wiring and dry it off, not realizing in my ignorance that this would not restore the power supply. Nor did it occur to me that I would receive an electric shock that would not be down dead. Luckily before I had extracted sufficient nails from the plank to lift it clear, and thus have revealed to me in all its complexity and dazzle the under floor wiring system. Two things happened. Skippy leaped upon me growling, his happy but hungry growl, flattening me beneath him, and there came an insistence something at my door. I wrestled with Skippy trying to throw him off, but he was as limpid. So I forced myself across the floor in a sort of serpentine wriggle like one of those creatures carrying a biblical curse. Although, in my case, it was a giant slobbering hound. Before I reached the door, however, it had been kicked in by one of those something upon it. Now in my hallway, under my under occur, I was confronted by a combination of enraged neighbors, who blamed me for the power outage, and a pair of uniform goons from the electricity police. It was these latter brute to kick the door down. One of them now grabbed hold of Skippy, and with main force through him at the wall, which being of plaster and weak, collapsed. As I choked on dust, I was bundled out by the other copper shoved down the stairs and into the street and into the back of a van, the doors of which was slammed and locked behind me. I wasn't too worried about Skippy, who was massive and savage enough to look after himself. But I wonder that my own predicament which might prove perilous, the electricity police had a fearsome reputation and not without reason. I lay on the floor of the van as it sped clanging through the deserted Sunday morning streets, consoling myself with the thought that at least I was not in the hands of the gas police, who as Rumor has it were much, much worse. Funnily enough, it had once been my ambition to join the gas police. Unfortunately, I failed all the entrance tests due to myopia and ignorance of gas. And instead I ended up as you know, tapping drivel into a blog. It was this thought that made me panic in the back of the van still clutching my towel, parts of my head still wet and the hearing only imperfectly returned to one ear. If I was going to be taken away somewhere by the electricity, police, how am I going to do my daily routine yard update. I hammered on the partition between my cage and the drivers nest or whatever it's called. This was a mistake. The van screeched and bumped and came to rest. I waited for the back doors to open up one of the couples to come and roughed me up. Instead, there was only an eerie stillness and silence. I remained trapped in the back of the van for hours and hours until after nightfall until Sunday had become Monday. During that time, I suffered hallucinations, or possibly even real occurrences involving electricity and gas and rent anomalies and zombies and vampires and crustaceans and talking sparrows and a serial shimmer rings and large boiling ovens and beings with tails that thump the ground as they skittered and Voodoo hobgoblins and start Nazi boffins and crazy paving and things with suckers and tendrils and globular appendages and wrinkled krones. And, oh, all sorts of stuff, either in the back of the van or up in the air or in a gloomy cellar, or as in a field menaced by machine gunning crop duster planes. What did I imagine? And what really happened? I don't know. Nor do I know if the whole thing was set up by the electricity police or if they were the victims for laws and Tad, the two who had dragged me for my flat were bulldozed into brimming pit at around 430 in the afternoon. As I said, it was a trying day, and by the time I got home via the hospital helicopter, it was the small hours of Monday morning.

Skippy was fast asleep in plaster dust, dreaming the dreams dogs dream. So I pulled out a bowl of reconstituted meat chunks in jelly ready for him when he woke up I retired to my palate, wondering at the fresh tattoo of a stylized chaffinch, which had appeared on my ankle and what it meant, and what it portended for my future. And when I find out, I will let you know.

Last week I read on the show a story called the boring dog. And then that piece I've just read, appeared on the website. And after that, I got a letter from a reader or listener, called Tim thurn, who seemed perplexed. Oh, beloved, Mr. Key he wrote, for some years now, hooting yard has been my honouring guide in forming my opinions and attitudes, and in some cases, even my behavior. Rarely will I venture a viewpoint upon any topic without first doing a mental accounting of what the yard has taught me. Thus, I find myself in a state of flux moment on the subject of our canine pals. I am unmoored, unable to work out the approved line on dogs. One day you tell us dogs are boring, but then you write with some affection of Skippy a dog you feed and pamper, and which appears to be your domestic pet. I cannot be the only listener who is utterly confused by these divergent dog attitudes, and would be extremely grateful if you could, in some ways shed light upon the matter. I'm not going to read out the rest of Tim's wordy letter which veers off into an account of the many and various dogs with which he's come into contact during his life. Better that I set him straight without further ado. Clearly when reading of Skippy, Tim picked up on the word, bark and Hound and curl, and also I assume on the detail, Skippy is fed from a bowl on reconstituted meat chunks in jelly. Any reader or listener, not just Tim could be forgiven for thinking that I was referring to a dog. But dogs are not the only beasts that bark, seals bark, Skippy is in fact, a seal. Now, it's certainly true that seals are rarely if ever referred to as hounds or kurz and are not in the general run of things fed in a manner or with the fair Skippy enjoys. But Skippy is a particular kind of seal known as a selkie or selkie. That's Sal KE or SLCH ie. That is an allegedly mythical type of seal, which, when on land can shape shift and take on other forms, often human, but sometimes dog or cat or cow, or extraordinarily, wasp or Hornet. The selkie is not, however, a wholly convincing shifter of shape, and whatever form it takes, it flops onto land from its watery domains. It always retains a recognizably pinnate Pdn character. If one were lazy, one might call Skippy half seal, half dog, but that's too simplistic and gives quite the wrong impression of his physical appearance. Depending upon the time of day and the play of light, and the humidity of the air. Skippy can look almost exactly like a common seal, or like a Mastiff, or even from some angles, like a giant, ungainly Sparrow. One of the former takes on land he barks and tend towards other dog related behavior, such as fetching, thrown sticks, drooling, and when allowed, leaving blind people safely through the many impairments of the city scape, though myopic, I'm not blind myself, but I make a little bit of pin money by renting Skippy out to sightless folk who require a canine guide for half an hour or so, while their regular dog is meeting an appointment at the veterinary surgery, which happens to be bang next door. It will be said that I must have known when describing Skippy as a hound and occur that readers and listeners would leap to the conclusion that I was referring to a dog rather than to a selkie. After all, selkies are not the most common of beasts to keep as domestic pets. I grant that. In mitigation, all I can say is that on the day I was writing about the quality of the light seeping in through the windows, and more particularly through the bathroom window, sort of milky soapy loosens, lent Skippy a dog Enos such that even I could forget for a moment that he is in fact a seal.

more problematic is the matter of Skippy diet. As far as I'm aware, most seals like to eat fish, often swallowing them whole. Whether it be sprats or sardines or dabs, the average seal and indeed the average selkie. If there is such a being can happily eat nothing but fish throughout its life, a life by the way, which an actuary would calculate at roughly 25 to 30 years. On the other side of me from the veterinary surgery, surgery, there is a seal actuaries office, and I checked those figures with him a few minutes ago, in a break between writing the paragraphs, I didn't mention it at the time thinking it better to present the information as a pertinent point, rather than interrupting my flow to button the whole view with a newly discovered fact. Incidentally, Mr. 10, boom, these actory is blind, and he has a sickly guide dog often in need of stomach pumping at the veterinary surgery. So I regularly hire Skippy out in for little trips to the newsagent or the green grocer located as they are on the other side of a wide Boulevard, frantic with hurtling container lorries. Missing Mrs. 10 boom, the actor his wife, knitted a splendid little tabard for Skippy to wear on such excursions, yellow with black stripes, which can give him a disconcerting resemblance to an enormous B. But I must keep on track and return to the important matter of Skippy diet. I recognize that having described my pet selkie as a hound and occur and mentioned his barking the clincher for Tim thurn, and others, leaving them to assume I was writing about a dog was the reference to a bowl of reconstituted meat chunks in jelly. After all, long years of experience, tell us whether we're dog owners or not. That's such a male is dairy girl for our canine pals. I will not muddy the waters by pointing out that cats are commonly fed on broadly similar lines. I've not received any letters asking me to clarify whether or not Skippy is of the feline persuasion. As a selkie, one might expect Skippy to salivate happily at the sight of the aforementioned sprats and sardines and dabs, but not a food fit for a dog presented in a bowl setup on the floor. Many seals jump in the air to catch thrown fish rather than snuffling with their faces buried in a bowl. Yet recall one of the defining characteristics of the selkie is that while in water it is wholly a seal upon land, it shifts shape and takes on partially and spookily other forms. We cannot expect a transformation in certain light of its outward appearance to go on accompanied by a corresponding terrestrial in jumble mint of its innards. The innards of a seal or a selkie are not nearly blubber. There is complex and miraculous as the innards of many another organ organism. If you've ever detected anything, be a fruit bat or a butter cup, you will know what I'm talking about. That thus, once having heaved itself ashore and bid goodbye to the sea, either temporarily or permanently. The selkies transmogrification Even if it is mythical, is startling. In Skipper's case, by becoming in some manner doggish he discovered doggish appetites, we've already ascertained that he enjoys chasing after thrown sticks. Why then should he not see the allure in a bowl of reconstituted meat chunks in jelly placed before him on the floor? That doesn't make him a dog. It makes him a selkie, which on land in the play of light appears to the human eye to be a dog more or less if one does not examine him too closely.

It will be asked whether a cell he chooses the terrestrial formula adopt or weather as it emerges from the sea. It is subject to forces both eerie and inexplicable and takes the form destined for it by the seal of God's eye. Confess I do not know the answer to that question. Better minds than mine have wrestled with it. Not least Mrs. 10 boom, the seal accessories wife, the tab odd knitter Ashley net, she devotes her powerful brain to all sorts of abstruse and thorny problems regarding not merely seals and selkies but to anything that exercises her. By no means to she can find herself to the aquatic and amphibious. She is it is said one of the few people living who has read every word ever published by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson and not just read them but annotated them. Unfortunately, though, dozens of Dobson Esther besieged her to make public her notes and marginalia she refuses point blank, often with the aid of a baseball bat. She's a dear old thing, a good neighbor and a tab our niche woman who genius but just as there are religionists to claim to have a personal relationship with Jesus, this is 10 boom insists upon an exclusive Vulcan mind meld with the out of print pamphleteer and bashes centralis with her bat, anyone who tries to broach it. For my part, I salute her as the Skippy who has recently devised a fantastic saluting gesture with his right flipper, which looks in a certain cast of light, like a poor.

on farm, a frack usually cut his own hair hacking with a pair of shears. But one day, he left his cows in the care of a hired gun and scroll to the nearest village to seek out a barber. There was no barber in the village. So old farmer frac carried on along the lane until he came to another village. He found not a barber, but a hairdresser. Unlike many hairdressing establishments, which are fond of panning names, such as hair, a parent or a cut above, and so on and so forth. This one was called simply rudimentary hairdressing for peasants, which suited old farmer frac down to the ground. He crashed in through the door, threw himself into a chair, and as the mildly startled hairdressers tucked a sheet around him. He bellowed that he wanted a chop suey. The hairdresser had no idea what this mad old farmer was talking about, and tried to explain that the only haircut available was a rudimentary one suitable for a peasant. old farmer frac, shouted that as far as he was concerned, a chop suey was a basic haircut, and commanded the hairdresser to get on with it. hairdressers are not cows, however, and are much less tractable. This particular hairdresser took much pride in her work, and was not about to embark upon a haircut. The lineaments of which she was ignorant. So she asked all farmer frac to describe the chop suey. as farmers go, old farmer Frank was a highly intelligent man with an acute visual sense, and a more than serviceable vocabulary. But he was also mad. So in reply to the hairdresser, he blather, the scarcely intelligible Farago of nonsense. So persuasive was his tone of voice. However, the hairdresser was spellbound, and convinced that she actually had some understanding of what he was saying. No sooner had he shot his trap. Then she hacked his hair with a pair of pruning shears for all the world as if you'd been practicing the chop suey for years. old farmer frac was well pleased with the result gave the hairdresser a generous tip, in addition to the cost of the hair cut, crashed out through the door, and when did his way jauntily back to his cows. Several days later, stories appeared in the local newspapers, reporting that an apparition of the late novelist Anthony Burgess has been seen stalking the lines of our baileywick for the awful truth was the old farmer frack Chop Suey could easily be mistaken for the preposterous Mancunian polymaths haircut memorably described by his biographer Roger Lewis as follows And how are we going to describe his hair? The yellowish white powdery strands were coil got his scalp like Bram Stoker's Dracula pareek not maintained since Prince Vlad the Impaler fought off of the Turks in the Carpathian Mountains in 1462. What does it say about a man that he could go around like that, as Burgess did? Though he was a king of the komova did the clumps in front emanate from his ear hole? No professional barber can be blamed for this. I thought to myself, he has no idea how strange views. What did he think he looked like? He evidently operated on his own head with a pair of garden shears.

Time left but I'll just read this to you never want to be troubled by the chronology of cultural fads. Poet Dennis beer pint is trying to reinvent himself as a beatnik. He's been seen about town sporting a goatee beard and a jet black Polo neck sweater. A concerned beer pint water suspect a copy of Allen ginsburg How may have fallen into his hands. Nothing. Dennis Pierpont writes my correspondent, his version of how we'll probably be called bleat, or woo misses. This seems a bit harsh to me. Though bear pine can be incorrigibly tweet and often fatuous, and it's best His work has reduced me to a sincerely sobbing heap of ouabain. I'm thinking of such pieces as lines upon the collision of a little pea wit with a hot air balloon, a poem I consider to be the finest pee wet related poem of the last millennium. It will be interesting to see where he goes in his new beatnik persona, Daddy, oh, well, perhaps not interesting, but at the very least, mildly diverting in a bit of piety way for those of us who follow his doings. I don't know if you follow the doings of Dennis bear tight, but you should continue to follow the doings of hooting yard which will be back again next week. Same time, same place, same overwhelming sense of something or other bye bye
