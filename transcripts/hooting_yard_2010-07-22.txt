It was shortly after breakfast time on a cold and storm tossed morning in the 1950s at the home of the 20th century's most magnificent pamphleteer. Dobson had eaten his bloaters marigold true had something eggy they were still sitting at their breakfast table. Outside hailstones were pinging. marigold Oh my darling dear boomed Dobson. I have devised a marvelous plan. Listen carefully, you often comment upon what you consider to be my breathtaking ignorance of the natural world. And though I usually SWAT away your charges as a giant may SWAT away a dwarf. I have this day found within myself a reservoir of humility, and I must admit there is a certain truth in what you say. Marian gold true interrupted here to suggest she captured Dobson's words upon a tape recorder for the settling of any future comfortable. But the pamphleteer pressed on that being so he said, My plan is to increase my knowledge in the best way possible. And what method could be more efficacious than to write a book about what I do not know. And not just any book. I shall take as my guide that great ancient encyclopedia by Pliny the Elder the natural history and rewrite it in its entirety. To ensure I cover the sweeping width and breadth of all natural phenomena, I should follow slavish Lee the chapter and section headings of the great work, but sub drawings to them, the text shall be my own. Is that not a fantastic plan? And a superb way to extend my knowledge of that which you claim me to be ignorant? of, again, I think if I'm to be grammatically sound, are you sure you mean subjoined? Dobson asked marigold, true. Who was in troublesome mood? I am not 100% certain No, but let that pass. Oh, my enamorado. The thing is, I've decided to begin the project this very day, not at the beginning, but plunging straight into the 10th book of Pliny, which you will recall is the one in which he addresses matters on as a logical that is an area in which you suggest my ignorance is boundless and unfathomable, so it will be the perfect testbed. And no, I'm not sure I mean, test bed, but let that pass to for the time being. I'm quite happy to do so. Said marigold true. For now my eggy breakfast is digested. I'm going off and out to a beekeeping Bonanza jamhuri get to the to the escrow tois and when I return, I shall be happy to have you read to me. The initial scribblings of your natural history book, I am sure will knock plenty from his plinth. Dobson took this rap party in good part scurried to his escrow suar sharpen the pencil and flung open his dusty copy of Pliny the 10th book.

The nature of birds, the ostrich, the Phoenix, he read, he closed his eyes and tried to summon a vision of an ostrich and a phoenix for separately then together. He was determined not to cheat by reading what Pliny the Elder had had to say on the subject nearly 2000 years ago. Then the pamphleteer shook his head like a man waking from a jarring dream, opened his eyes began to scribble with his sharpened pencil on the first page of a brand new Notepad. Both the ostrich and the Phoenix he wrote our birds, the one real the other mythical. On the front of the head of the real bird. There is a beak and low. What do we find on the front of the head of the bird of myth. It two has a beak. And this is not the only feature they have in common for the bodies of both birds bear plumage in the form of feathers. Thompson looked upon what he had done and saw that it was good. No doubt there would be more to say about both the ostrich and the Phoenix, but he felt he had at the very least cracked the method he planned to employ. Plenty would be his guide, but only his guide. The grand sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose would be Dobson's alone, he went to take a post breakfast nap. When he woke the pamphlet, his brain was befuddled after a series of dreams. The details of which so vivid in sleep, vanished, puffed, the instant his head rose from the pillow. He opened a can of revivifying sculpture and poured it into a tumbler, then sat again at his desk required to consult his plenty. Eagles, vultures, hawks, owls, woodpeckers. It was a long, long list of things with beaks and feathers. Dobson threw his pencil across the room, donned his great coat and his Belgian post office inspectors boots and went out in the teeth of the hailstorm to trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal to clear his head. He saw a number of birds while on his trudge, not one of which was either an ostrich or a Phoenix. He threw a pebble at a swarm. He stopped in an aisle mar purgatives canalside lobster hatchery and winter sports togs bizarre, and browsed among the lobsters and the winter sports togs. But in spite of the old ma offering bargains galore in a special hailstorm sale, Dobson, admired in penury as ever bought nothing. Eventually, he trudged back home, passing the paddle in which the pebble he had thrown at the swan had somehow fetched up as pebbles do. And as pamphleteers do, he returned to his escrow trois, sharpened another pencil and draw set in determination cast his eye over the Pliny peacocks, bustards swans, who pose partridges, goat suckers. This last reminded Dobson that he had a goat milk popsicle in the refrigerator, and he was about to go and fetch it for a mid morning snack when, towards the end of the content of Pliny's 10th book, he read instances of affection between snakes, and a bomb exploded inside his brain. Suddenly, Dobson recalled the dream from which he had awoken befuddled after his nap, he remembered it in every last detail, for it was his recurring dream, the one that flickered in his sleeping cranium on so many, many nights, and in so many, many daytime naps, and had done since infancy. He turned to a fresh page of his notepad and began scribbling. When I was a taught, he wrote, I had a favorite bedtime story, which I implored my mom or part of read to me before I fell asleep. I drank my bedtime beaker of milk of magnesia and settled my little head on my little pillow, and listened night after night to the tail, which ever since has haunted my dreams, and about which it is incomprehensible that I have not written a pamphlet until today. Well, thanks to Pliny the Elder. Now I can address that omission. The story began as follows.

Frank Key  14:11
Once upon a time, there was a boa constrictor named dagobert he was loitering on a verdant slope. When he happened to spot a passing vole, Daigo Bert uncoiled himself, pounds, sank his fangs into the tiny bowl and gulped it down in one Fang some a mouthful, but before his digestive juices could begin to reduce the paralyzed but yet living vowel into nourishing pulp, Along came a viper named crossguard. Maya my SOT dagobert What a lovely Viper she is. I feel a great pang of affection for her. cloth guard herself was a sore vexed Viper, for she had not eaten for many days. Oh, boa constrictor. loitering on the verdant slope can see help us all vexed Viper who has not eaten for many days. My name is Klaus guard, his cloth guard, so mighty with a pangs of affection felt by dagobert that he immediately regurgitated the vowel and offered it to the famished Viper. Why, thank you, she hissed. You are quite the most charming boa constrictor it has ever been my pleasure to meet. There was more to the story much more, but it was always around this point that as a Tod I fell into my golden slumbers, and ma oppa. Place the storybook gently by my little pillow and tiptoed away. This you will recognize I suspect as the opening of Dobson's important pamphlet, the significance in my long ago infancy of an M digested vowel out of print. He was still scribbling away furiously possessed by a pamphlet his demons when marigold Chu arrived home, sinking he was at work on his revision of plenty, she did not interrupt him, but went straight into the back garden. With the new bees. She had brought back from the Bonanza jamhuri knots until a few days later, when she asked Dobson if he had yet written his chapter on the nature of puff eggs, addled eggs and winged eggs. did she learn that the pamphleteer had abandoned his plenty of that? He said over breakfast, it's just one bird after another, I can't be doing with it.

More about Dobson's dreams Now, according to Hargrave Jennings in curious things of the outside world last fire, published in 1861. I quote, there are moments in the history of the busiest man when his life seems a masquerade. There are periods in the story of the most engrossed and most worldly minded man, when this strong fear will come like a cloud over him. When this conviction will start a thwart his horizon, like a flash from outer cloud, he will look up to the sunshine someday, and in the midst of the business class, by which he may be surrounded. A man will, in a moment's glance, seem to see the whole jostle of human interest and city bustle or any stir so much empty show. Like the sick person, he will sometimes raise his head and out of the midst of his distractions, and out of the grasp which that thing business always has of him, he will ask himself the question, what does all this mean? Is the whole world awake? And am I asleep and dreaming a dream? Or is it that the whole world is the dream and that I in this single moment, have alone awakened? That great 20th century pamphleteer. Dobson woke up in this state of mind every single morning of his adult life, and that was not the end of his confusion. For Dobson was a great one for naps. He took a nap daily, very often more than one plural naps as it were, and each time he woke from his naps, he likewise asked himself the questions posed by Hargrave Jennings as he had already done on the morning of the day, when first here won't. Do you have the slightest idea asked marigold to one blustery Blizzard Monday in the late 1950s. How tiresome it is to have you lumbering about the place like a Dippy person, asking the kinds of questions most sensible people stop posing when they outgrow their years of teen dumb. Dobson reply to this perfectly reasonable query was most annoying. Are you really speaking marigold? Or am I just imagining this conversation within the wispy mysterious mist of mystery? marigold who was holding a handful of pebbles and proceeded to throw one at the pamphleteer? No, sorry, that's not right. marigold true was holding a pebble had paperback and it was this she threw across the room. The book was pebble heads latest best selling potboiler the interpretation of breams, a guide to foretelling the future using a combination of fish and recordings of lute music. Luckily, the book Mr. Dobson's head by an inch. I am going to go about my business in the real palpable world. Dobson announced marigold true if you choose to waft about the place in a Moonstruck days. That is up to you, but it won't get any pamphlets written and she swept out of the house into the blizzard bent upon her real and palpable business, whatever it might have been that day. Dobson picked up the pebble head paper back from the floor and leave through it distractedly. He read a few lines here and there and decided to go out to the fishmongers and the record shop, but he got no further than the chair on which he sat to Don and to lace up his Canadian snowplow mechanics boots for getting mired in his dreamy days. He wondered if the chair the laces, the boots were but figments figments made him think of figs and then a Fig Newtons, a type of biscuit of which at this period he was inordinately fond, and with his right foot in case you in a boots the laces of which were not yet tied and his left foot merely in socked, he rose from the chair and made for the cupboard where in the biscuits and similar snack items were stored. When he stood he was in boot and sock necessarily lopsided, and this being so Dobson lost what balance he had a toppled bashing his bonds on the wainscot. He was unconscious for some minutes, during which time he really did dream of the glove of the Bowman and of his weak bumba, whatever that might mean. And of course, when he woke, sprawled on the floor, the pamphlet is swimming brain was yet again prompted to ask the Hargrave Jennings questions. Round and round we go in an endless cycle akin to the orbit of the planets around the sun.

marigold Chu was still out and about so Dobson was alone in his days. Now wide awake, but still unable to gain a foothold in the real palpable world. He moved about the house as a person might blunder about in a thick fog, what they used to call a piece of paper. Because of the supposed similarity of the cloudy density of the air to the consistency of soup made from peas. Not to be confused with peas pudding, which is, as its name suggests, a pudding, not a soup. Dobson was thinking neither off soup, nor of the Fig Newtons, which he had utterly forgotten. He was doing things such as tapping the walls with his fingertips, peering carefully at curtains, opening and then closing doors, or in some cases were leaving them ajar. As he tried to grasp what was real and what was not stumbling past an airing cupboard into the bathroom. He was astonished in a bleary way to come face to face with a monster of the deep wallowing in the tub. It was bloated, lascivious, coarse and repulsive, rather like Gertrude Everton's vision of Oscar Wilde, except that it had thins and hideous trailing tendrils like those of a jellyfish. One such tendril now lashed out and struck Dobson across the face, leaving not just a vivid Crimson stripe, but droplets of an unbelievably aggressive toxin, which seeped in second through his pores and began ravaging his innards. The pamphleteer toppled once again to the floor, this time of his bathroom rather than of his kitchen spill wearing one boot, but now he was convulsed by fit, as if he were Voltaire's officer with pinks in his chamber, alluded to in another passage from Hargrave Jennings is very sensible book, and like the officer Dobson lost his senses. In the tub, the sea monster now began to gurgle and a splash about suddenly through the bathroom window crashed father Ninian tongue lash, the Jesuit priest and self styled soutien, a tired nemesis of sea monsters, clashing in one gloved hand a harpoon, and then the other a crucifix, then then then I woke, and I realized that all I've just written down and spoken to you was a dream. Of course it was. Dobson didn't become the Titanic pamphleteer. He was by faffing about the place or muddle headed. When he woke up every day of his adult life. He knew exactly where he was. And if perchance, there was a smidgen of doubt in the matter, he would, in any case, plunge his head into a bucket of ice water just to be on the safe side. How foolish of me to confuse the hallucinations of my sleeping pea sized brain with the iron truth.

And we're reaching the end of today's shooting out on the air. I'll read one more piece but before I do just a reminder to visit the hooting yard website, hooting yard, one word hooting yard.org, much to read pictures to look at books to buy. And of course, it would really help if you made a donation while you're there. There's a couple of little buttons, PayPal buttons, that would be very helpful. If you should do that while you're looking at the website. And I'd like to finish this week show with a cautionary tale. It gurgled then it swept away what it was I could not say. I saw it in our Looking Glass just after a mesmeric path. The mediums hand passed down my spine, moving in a plumb straight line. I glanced into the mirror then and counted slowly up to 10 the thing appeared atop my head, its talents tore it slashed. I bled. Then it gurgled and swept away. I'm going to sell it on eBay, if I can find out where it went. The medium by the way, is bent, bent and crooked a charlatan, he said he'd summon the grunty man. Instead, this thing attacked and fled, leaving a gash upon my head. I must apply a poultice now then turn the medium into a cow by casting a fiendish spell on him a spell so fiendish and so grim, that he'll regret he messed with me. I am the grumpy man. You see.

Frank Key  27:23
I realize there's still a minute or so to go. So I'll say goodbye for this week. I'll be back next week with some more stuff, including excitingly, further Adventures of father Ninian Tang lash the self styled soutine a tired nemesis of sea monsters, so there's something for you to look forward to. Bye bye
