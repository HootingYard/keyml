Good evening and welcome to resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And as with last week, I'm going to continue with some time travel finding out what was happening or happening at hunting yard 10 years ago, in March 2006 10 years anyway, one thing that was happening at hooting yard 10 years ago was this elbow room can be defined as free space on either side of a human body into which the elbows can be extended outwards. You can test whether you have elbow room by standing up with your arms at your side, and then raising your hands, keeping them to the side of your body, your arms will form an angle with the elbows at the apex. I am not familiar with many standard geometrical terms. So Apex may be the incorrect word. But I'm sure you know what I mean. In my view, and lack of precise knowledge or not prevent me from applying my puny yet pulsating brain to matters of interest, you may retort with some justification, that it would be easy enough for me to look up the information about which I'm unclear, either in a reference book or on the internet. I can't really argue with that. But if I started checking up on everything of which I'm ignorant, I'd be kept busy forever in a day, and wouldn't have time to actually write anything. Do not please tell me to confine myself to writing about things I already know, or that I'm confident enough to babble on about without corroborating the fact, there are indeed statements I can make, which I do not need to verify assertions, which I would challenge anyone to disprove. I know, for example, that the character played by David McCallum and The Man from UNCLE was named illya kuryakin. I know that Robert Burton wrote the anatomy of melancholy, under the pseudonym democritus, Jr. I know that I can find eternity in a grain of sand. Were right to limit myself to that which I already know, not only would I get bored, but so would you, the listener, still standing I trust with your elbows akimbo, relishing the free space on either side of your body, and knowing that this is what we call elbow room. Now you can draw your elbows in and sit down again. I have of course made the assumption that you were able to extend your elbows outwards as suggested, but it may be that you do not have elbow room. Perhaps you are a dangerous and brain sick criminal and you have been confined for the safety of both yourself and others to a tiny, tiny cell. Maybe you're a fanatical adherent of some calls, and have gathered together with your fellows on mass scrunched up against one another and shouting your heads off in protest pins to a designated section of the market square by Riot police kitted out with helmets batons and field. Or you may be out in open country, taking the air with plenty of elbow room and a vast amount of space Besides, and you may have taken a wrong turn and found yourself in Gulf by a herd of cows being driven slowly along the line by a peasant. These things happen believe you may in the unlikely event that you're listening to this in any of these circumstances, or in any other situation which does not afford you elbow room, you can always test the validity of my argument. Next time you are less squashed up. Bear in mind that you should never take elbow room for granted. It's a precious thing, and you would do well to treasure it.

Next week, I'll be talking about something else of which I'm not 100% certain Doing so will benefit both me and you. I have not yet decided upon the topic, but there's so so much to choose from for The universe is boundless and my knowledge of it is as tiny as the tiniest thing you could ever imagine in your wildest and most hectic dreams. If you'd like to suggest a subject for my blathering, please write to me@hooting.yd at gmail.com using the headline, header header anyway, whatever you call it, always Mr. Key, why don't you write about dot, dot dot, where the ellipsis is replaced by the topic of your choice.

Another thing that happened to hooting out 10 years ago, and well this all happened a long, long time ago before you were born. It was a pagan time, a bit like The Wicker Man but we'd no sign of extravagant Buffon's yellow Polo neck jumpers and repressed police officers. Think more along the lines of Flint arrowheads, woad and grunting. When we turn our minds to ancient peoples, be they pagan sun worshipers, cave dwellers or marauding warriors, we tend to think of them as a homogenous mass rather than as a collection of individuals. we ascribe to them the sameness which is one of the more arresting characteristics of beings from other planets in science fiction, a common language, wardrobe, hairstyle and so on. If we ever do meet alien life forms, they will almost certainly be as multifarious as all living things on Earth. This is of course, no less true of our pagan ancestors. So I want you to consider that the pagan to whom we will now turn our attention was not just an inarticulate road daubed bogged dweller, wrapped in filthy animal hides, though he certainly fit that description. But they had a personality to one that made him unique as is every single while of God's creatures. The name of this pagan has not come down to us, but what we do know is something of his character. He was cranky. cranky, cantankerous petulant, call it what you will. Have you been a primitive pagan with matted hair, running saws, rotten teeth and the distinct possibility of being laid upon a stone slab and sacrificed to the sun god, you too, might have thrown the occasional tantrum. Yet the capacity of the human spirit to cope with the most appalling circumstances is quite astonishing. And it has to be said that all of the cranky pagans compadres bore life's ills with fortitude. The cranky pagan did not, he moaned and moped and grizzled and grumbled and flew into boiling tempers. He was moody and impossible. You might wonder why his companions did not shun him or beat him about their head with clubs until he stopped being fractious, or indeed, why they did not put him first on the list to have his heart torn from his breast, and offered in trembling supplication to appease their enraged sungold. We cannot be sure that they had such a list, but archaeologists have found mysteriously neat scraping marks on certain stones. And it doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination, to conclude that the marks were made by some pagan highroad, fant, designating appointed victims. These ancient people may have been primitive by our standards, but they had a sense of order, and a system bureaucrats flourish in every time and every place. Alas. cranky he may have been, but the cranky pagan was a superb cook. And that is why he was not just tolerated but treasured. To gain some idea of just how much he was valued. Imagine that all you have eaten for the last six months is the meat of birds and small mammals, usually raw, tearing at it ravenously with your aching teeth, blood dripping down your jaw. And then along comes the cranky pagan, growling and grunting as usual, but excitedly and with a gleam in his eyes shining brilliantly through the splattering of roads that covers his face. He points young And grabbers and beckoned due to follow him wiping the blood of a weasel from your chin, you Creek to your feet and plowed after the cranky pagan. He leads you to the edge of the bog. There on a flat piece of ground is deposited a heap of goo. He bends, dips his grubby hand in it scoops out some of the goop and shoves it into his mouth. he swallows and then he speaks. Obviously he does not express himself in modern English. So in reporting what he says I've taken certain liberties

Frank Key  10:38
and what he says is, do not look so surprised to see me shoveling this goo into my mouth and swallowing it. You need not while your arms about in such an alarm. I have invented pudding. I gathered a collection of nuts and berries and mash them all together. And then I worked out a way of making the Mac hot with fire and flame. And this is the result. It is delicious. It is called pudding. Try some and there you have it. I only wish we knew precisely which notes which berries went into this pudding. But we don't and perhaps we never will.

As you might remember from last week, 10 years ago, every every time hooting yard was updated, it included a quotation from another source. And this is from this is from from out of the silence by Bessie Kiffin Taylor, anger, despair, ferocity, hunger, terror, all were depicted upon those awful faces. Through the cracked glass, deadly fumes began to steal. My room seemed cloudy. I was as if transfixed, unable to move to call to reach the lights to do ot but spans staring tremblingly the faces pressed closer and yet closer, they reached the glass, it cracked again and more fuse poured in long arms, there seemed hundreds of them reached wildly up skinny hands, like those of skeletons were held out as if to grasp. Isn't that terrifying? So, to counter that such terrors has been instilled in you by that quotation from Betty Kiffin Taylor. Here's a task task. Describe a typical Dobson breakfast scene. On the face of it this sounds like a simple enough assignment. It is, of course, anything but those who have even a passing acquaintance with the Titanic out of print pamphleteer Dobson know that the word typical and breakfast can never be crammed together. It is an understatement to say that he had mixed feelings about breakfast. There were times when he was up and about before dawn, gobbling down a huge bowl of porridge there again. He sometimes stumbled downstairs at noon bleary and fractious, waving his arms in dismissal of a profit slice of toast. from one day to the next, there was no knowing how Dobson would greet the day, and howsoever he did greeted no knowing with what foodstuffs if any, the day would commence. I cannot in all honesty then describe a typical Dobson breakfast scene as is required of me. Instead, I propose to examine to dub Sony and breakfast from different stages in his life. To which I will add some observations on a pamphlet he planned but never wrote on this important topic. We'll do the first breakfast scene. I wish to evoke is one that took place when Dobson was living around the corner from the notorious flat pop pop see shadrack pop sees well kept secret at the height of her flap Adam, was that she was the devoted Mother of an infant. Her daughter grew up to become the Daredevil adventurous tiny Enid. At the time of this breakfast, however, tiny Enid was not even a twinkle in her mother's eye. popsy shadrach was returning from a gym joint at dawn, and crashed her jalopy into Dobson's head. Waking the pamphleteer who leapt out of bed thundered out into his front garden, carried the standard Demi mundane into his parlor and sought to revive her by winding up his gramophone and playing the dodrio from bohuslav Martino's Concerto for String Quartet and orchestra, an ear splitting volume. With popsy sprawled on the couch and the music moving inexorably towards its sonorous B minor climax. Dobson busied himself in the kitchen. Outside it began to pour with Raven steam hissed from the jalopy smashed up engine, so much steam that the head was obscured. This was the inspiration for Dobson's tremendous pamphlet, hedges hidden from sight by steam out of print, the only one of his works to be illustrated with watercolours. When the music stopped, Dobson bid the groggy but only slightly injured flapper to join him at the breakfast table. He preened and eight bloaters popsy contented herself with a tumbler of gin suck from a straw for her wrist was sprained and she could not hold the glass.

Frank Key  16:57
We move forward for decades to consider a second Dobson breakfast scene. But voters have their place here too. But there is no Jen no popsy shadrack no tiny Enid by now an adult famed wherever people speak of Daredevil adventurous is and no hedge hidden by steam. In fact, there's no hedge at all, for Dobson has moved on, as we all must sooner or later. The second breakfast I invite you to ponder was prepared and consumed in an ante room on the sixth floor of a palace belonging to the plenipotentiary overthrown General of a disputed territory south of the great frightening River. What in heaven's name was the impecunious pamphleteer doing in such sumptuous surroundings? I should point out that he was only there for three days having been invited under the mistaken assumption that he was a tuner of pianos an easy error to make given that his most recent pamphlet was entitled I piano truda. Dobson's host to clearly not read beyond the cover page. Even cursory reading of the text would show that the pamphleteer was wholly ignorant of his subject. It is one of his most mystifying tract being largely concerned with the unrelated topics of soup and buttons, but let that pass. There is Dobson muffled from the workaday world and a suite of rooms hung with rich brocade tapestries, while embarrassed arrangements are made for a special sealed train to whisk him away, leaving the planet potentially overthrown. generals piano uncrewed morning sweeps across the sky on the pamphleteers final morning. The trade is due at 10. A factotum enters Dobson's temporary booth while burying the tray, and upon the tray is the territory's traditional breakfast, a dish of boiled marrow steeped in honey from ram bees, a block of dry cocoa bread, and a piping hot beaker of a local decoction into which raw egg has been broken. The factotum places the tray on a side dresser and flings open the heavy curtains flooding the room with milky light. Turning the lackey is about to awaken the snoozing pamphleteer but Dobson is nowhere to be seen. The bed clothes or rumpled discarded pajamas are strewn on the floor, but the breakfast tea has vanished. Eventually, the factotum cracks Dobson down to an empty room adjoining the palaces Sixth Floor kitchens, where he is sitting alone, having helped himself to his breakfast from an astonishingly well stocked larder Dobson is preening and eating below. I said I would end this piece by mentioning an unwritten Dobson pamphlet. He planned at one stage to compile a list of every breakfast he had ever eaten from infancy onwards, and made some preparatory notes. To the board listing he intended to add observations on Play settings, tablecloth, cutlery, and crockery and general ambience. We should be thankful that he never actually wrote this work. For it would have been as dull as dishwater, but not the fearsome ditch water that was the main ingredient of the palace breakfast decoction. That ditch water was by no means doll for when the factotum poured, Dobson's untouched beaker fall down the sink. It sizzled and hissed, and corroded the piping, it corroded the potting of the palace, and the palace collapse.

We all know that there was an age known as the epoch of snares, but it's surprising how little is generally known about it. This was a time when giant badger like beings roamed the hills of the earth. When the oceans were deeper, darker and more terrifying than they are now, and when only the very bravest of souls volunteered to crew the enormous primitive container ships that plied across those seas. It was an age of seeding murderousness of great cosmic shift of soaring of roaring winds that uprooted the few petals, scraggly vegetation, that struggled for life in soil that was not soil as we know it today. In the epoch of snares, soil was much more friable and crumbly, and sometimes even very crumbly. It seldom had the compactness or density to hold a plant secure from the biting wind, the same wind to intense coldness seemed somehow to inspire the giant badger like beings up in the hills. There were more hills then higher, more rounded, covering vast expanses. In those times, shoes had not been invented. How to imagine the fearsome burly sailors on those container ships did everything they had to do in bare feet, or sometimes wearing sock like wrappings. We no longer know how such things were made, from what materials with what technology for all the wrappings that were ever worn have perished, and our only evidence is some briskly scribbled drawings done with the aid of a clairvoyant whose bruise when taken in sufficient quantities enabled her to picture the past. Or so she claimed. Men and women were outnumbered by pelicans in those days, some estimates say there were 200 pelicans to every person. But these were not our modern pelicans. They came in all sizes, some as tiny as hamsters, others bigger than the biggest of the giant badger like beings that roam the windswept hills. Some would have it that a huge asteroid from a faraway galaxy, lumbered with millions upon millions of eggs smashed into the earth, and the impact scattered these alien eggs and from them the pelicans hacked but this is a frankly ludicrous theory, and one not given credence when one considers that it was propounded by a gibbering maniac chained to the wall of a server in a bleak and derelict village. That maniac is my brother, so I know whereof I speak. Indeed, so deciduous has my studies been these last 50 years that I believe I know more about the epoch of snares than anyone else alive. I know what freight was carried in those primitive container ships that cross seamlessly from shore to shore. bales, a staggering number of bales of every size and description handled and watched over with infinite care by those fearsome fearless sailors. A special breed so different from the we the land lovers who vied for scarce resources with innumerable pelicans, and so nearly lost the struggle. But of course, the pelicans were all but wiped out in just one winter. And even I do not know how that happened. The epoch of snares is notable too because it was an era when only one type of cloud appeared in the sky, namely the anvil cloud. The Anvil cloud is the description for the upper portion of a towering cumulonimbus mostly ice, which forms high in thunderstorms, and there were constant thunderstorms at that time. People did not then fear thunder and lightning as many do today. Nor did the pelicans fear the rack and roar of storms. But what do you think it was that had all those giant badger like beings charging back and forth over the hills? terror is the answer, terror of thunder in particular, these strange beasts is what hypersensitive could hear things that people and pelicans could not. And whatever it was, they heard in the thunder filled them with fear, and so they would be forever seeking a place of safety, but never finding one for they never came down from the high hills.

Frank Key  26:30
The Badger beings to died out, but not at the same time as the pelicans. Clear logic a lot peoples have flattened many of the hills where they crashed around in panic, and no one has yet found any trace of their bones. Perhaps it's true what my brother says that the Badger beings never existed, were but a viper in the brain of some historical fantasy list, but I doubt he can be right about that, and so hopelessly ridiculously wrong about the pelicans. I hope you will concur. As we have seen, the people of that time had no shoes, nor did they have saints. As far as I've been able to ascertain. They didn't have what we would think today. As of as a religion, to be sure they subscribe to a cosmogony. They had some dim, dull witted inkling of how the earth and the heavens, the sun and the moon and stars and andwill Cloud all fitted together. But it was not one I've wasted time trying to understand, for it was clearly idiotic. I have in my pouch, a diagram made by that clairvoyant I mentioned earlier, which purports to show the universe as understood in the epoch of snares, but it's a slapdash diagram, and I feel only muddies waters already murky enough. And why everyone asks sooner or later, is this long ago age known as the epoch of snares? Why not the epoch of bales of badger beings of interplanetary pelicans? Why not the epoch of enormous primitive containerships applied across the seas? Why not Indeed, the epoch of no shoes go to the bleak and derelict village, enter that dark, dank cellar, approached the gibbering maniac chained to the wall. asked my brother, he will tell you and that is the end of this week's hooting yard. Next week we might be back in 2016. I don't know we might, we might still be back in 2006 or even earlier. Who knows? Bye bye.
