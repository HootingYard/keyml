Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air half an hour of prose. Here is an exciting craft project for young and old alike. Follow the instructions carefully, and you will be the proud and happy owner of a toy crow made out of balsa wood. Imagine the flabbergasted looks of family and friends as they admire your handiwork and resolve to become better more productive citizens by following your example. Imagine them gnashing their teeth in despair as it becomes apparent that they are cack handed nincompoops, whereas you are the very opposite of a butter fingers. Incidentally, if you are by chance or butter fingers, do not be deterred. All you need is self belief. Sometimes in the teeth of the evidence, just go away and read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand and stop sniffily. First of all, obviously, you will need some balsa wood. I'm afraid that you'll probably have to pay for it. If you're a mendicant and cannot countenance preferring your poultry beggins on something as essential as balsa wood, you may have to resort to theft. I cannot condone even the most measly purloined ment of craft materials, or indeed anything else. So we would seem to have reached an impasse help maybe at hand, however, from various charitable institutions, or even from wealthy individuals who share a passion for balsa wood work. You could try writing letters to such as Yoko Ono, the Duke of Norfolk, or Lynne cheney. The latter is the wife of the Vice President of the United States, not to be confused with long Cheney, the deceased film actor. Here is a model letter you can use to ask for assistance, dear, insert name here. Like you, I am an enthusiastic boxer wood crafts person. Unlike you, I am poverty stricken. Please send me some of your spare balsa wood so I can make a toy crow. You're sincerely insert your name that should do the trick and keep you away from a life of crime, the consequences of which can be disastrous, only last week and ne'er do well was apprehended while trying to steal a troupe of modeling paste from Huberman and he's due to be hanged imminently. He will certainly not be the envy of his friends and the possessor of a crow made out of balsa wood, so do not even think about emulating him. So you now have your balsa wood. Next, you will need adhesive. There is a range of glues and gums available from Huberman and elsewhere. And I think I can leave it to you to make the right choice. It really doesn't matter whether the glue is clear or cloudy or white. Whether the method of delivery is via a nozzle or a squeezy pad or a spatula, whether it comes in a tube or a tub or a jar. The only thing you need to keep an eye on is whether or not it's sticky enough to fuse two pieces of balsa wood so decisively that they cannot be prized apart even by wild beasts. You may want to test the adhesiveness of your chosen adhesive before cementing the purchase. If you are in who Berman's you can go to the little cupboard near the fire escape to do so. And I'm sure other retailers have similar facilities. Although there may be a fee involved. I will assume you have returned home safely with a suitable adhesive and that your pile of bought or donated balsa wood awaits you on your kitchen table. If you do not have a kitchen table. For example, if your kitchen is pokey, and does not accommodate much more than a bread bin and a kettle, any old table will do. If you do not have a table of any sort, just use the floor, but sweep it clean of filth please. Now, the next step is to sort out your balsa wood, working methodically and with rigorous self control divvy the balsa wood into discrete piles putting like with like, so for example, plates together pieces that might serve as beaks those suitable for wings or talents

and so forth. By the end of the exercise, you should have separate piles of balsa wood for each part of a Crow's anatomy. If you lack ornithological confidence, and are not entirely To show what a crow looks like, don't be afraid to consult a reference book, preferably one with lots of pictures. Just make sure that the book you choose has a section on birds. There are a few paperbacks in the basement of humans, but for a broader selection, you may want to look further afield. Now is the time to make use of VAT adhesive. Remove the lid or wrench off the cap or pierce the seal of the tube or jar or tab. Sometimes this is easier said than done, and you may need to be violent. If you are a weakling. some preliminary strengthening exercises are recommended. Or as a shortcut, you can try drinking various invigorating syrups those of you who choose the latter or to seek advice from a qualified medical practitioner, and I stress the word qualified quacks, shaman mounted banks and wizards cannot be trusted as far as you could throw them if you were not a weakling, no matter how exciting their various potions may seem. Be diligent in examining the certificates and diplomas of your chosen medeco. And remember that things are not always as they seem, and there is a roaring trade in counterfeit documents. If you have even the tiniest suspicion that there is an attempt to hoodwink you with a forgery, call the police immediately. Okay, you are ready to build that crow. Keeping an eye on a reference book picture if necessary. Assemble the CRO by gumming together bits of balsa wood taken from the separate piles. I don't need to go through this in inordinate detail because you're not stupid, but to get you started and to make sure you don't make a ridiculous mess of the whole thing. Just remember to stick together the bits of the crow that are contiguous. For example, the beak goes on the head. The talents are at the far ends of the legs from the body and so on. You may find that there is an anatomical crow part for which you do not have a corresponding pile of suitably shaped balsa wood pieces. If so, throw caution to the winds and improvise. strike an attitude of vivacity and daring and all else will follow. Trust me. When you are done, and you compare your balsa wood crow with the picture you have probably been working from you will notice that something is not quite right. Do not be downcast. I am not yet done. At this point, you need to go back to Huberman find the paint department and get some black paint and the paintbrush. Men Dickens should have already fired off letters to paint keen wealthy people such as Arianna Huffington or Art Garfunkel. Now, before slapping the paint onto your CRO, make sure that each piece of balsa wood is thoroughly stuck to the piece next to it. As you batch it and wrench it and throw it around the room, it is possible that the parts may break off. If this happens, splurge more glue on and reattach whatever part it is the beak or a feather with a bit more vim. When you're sure that your crow will not fall apart. paint it black all over two or three times. Replace the lead on your tin of paint and wash your paintbrush very thoroughly under the hot water tap or with a slosh of terps depending on the type of paint you used. And that's it. When the paint is dry, you can pick up your balsa wood Crow and take it round to show off to your family and friends who will be flabbergasted just as I promised. One note for mendicants if you made your crow using donated balsa wood and paint, it's good manners to write a letter to your benefactor in closing a snap of the wooden bird. I know I gave you a model letter to copy before but this time I'm going to leave you to your own devices. For by now you will I hope you have the confidence to stand on your own two feet and the no further mollycoddling.

clop stocks jug band crumble bass tar boosh, the latest best selling paperback by pebble head is a wonderful education of those much lamented sappan soft days. tipping tapping Flim Flam goose grease and lavender and a tin of Polish for the porch. The light and the tunnels and the flap of the flaps in the flat bury out by the buyer. Those endless bowls of piping hot pork Such were the joys of the sappan SOP days, he writes. And if like me, you're an unreconstructed sappan sophist, it all comes flooding back. There was an earlier Book Of course by in spip and I stand by my review when it first came out in hardback, where I wrote, this book is shoddy and inadequate and inadequate. It is thoroughly inadequate. In Spirit had the temerity to write what he called a thorough and adequate account of those seven SOP days, despite being a secret sopan se. When I revealed this gruesome truth in spit was discredited and his bones were thrown off a cliff into the churning ocean. Good riddance to him say I. pebble head, by contrast, has the measure of those sappan soft days, it seems he has listened to contemporary tape recordings of claimants and wardens and tosspot and although his tone is often desperate, when it is not twittering, he nails it. By it, I mean a very concrete sense of urbane jug band merriment. And the names you would expect are all here. Though I cannot repeat any of them for legal reasons. I don't want my bones to follow in spits off that golden mighty cliff. The point about pebble heads pros in his examination of sappan SOP ism is that he chugs along, chug, chug, chug in a way that is attractive to those who like their pros to have that kind of locomotive trembling rhythm. Pale poets may skip and prance and paler poets may gamble cross, verdant sward, but generally such pale power testers have a whiff of the sopan SAP about them. I do not make the charge lightly. I would say the same where I standing on the beach at dusk surrounded by goals scavenging among the bleached bones of the inspect. There are worse ways to end one's day. I have loved and been bitter sometimes when recalling those sappan sob days, the gleaming lanterns, the Flint hearts, the barbican's on top of the tools, some comes to genuflect and some come to Keene. And those are their ways, and I shall not gainsay them, or if I do I feel crunch across their own gravel on my hands and knees to prove my point. You will not hear such claims from the pips of this world, this spinning globe. This dispensation in spit was it in his mouth when his horrible book came out, and he was betrayed by a clairvoyant. That is often how these things turn out how tangled skeins unravel, the clairvoyant was unbridled, certainly, and mouthy, but that made a welcome change, guttural imprecations and gargling were her mode of speech if speech it can be called. And as soon as he heard what was being said about him, the wretched in spirit tried to flee. Typical I may say of those who observe the sopan satis to butcheries for the butcheries they are his fleeing or rather his failed fleeing took him to places human beings or better avoid, such as the wild hills and the fiercest sea fronts, the most dismal of outcrops and the 10 years to fairground arcades, tinny eight walls and tacky and awash with Tat, and they're in spec was cornered there he was revealed as a pooper, whose cronies vanished, gone, leaving him alone in his poopourri. He knew his book was but page after page of meretricious square Moogle yet he pressed on writing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages like a blanket. I have said elsewhere that he never knew the first thing about the SAP and SOP days not because attempt to not be made in his childhood to bash a few basic ideas and his curly haired head, but because he willfully let all that he did once no evaporate, like a type of milk in a tin. It is a mystery why he did so why he allowed the sopan scientists to squish their boggling into him. He was packed so tight with it he might have burst.

The service pebble head does in his new book is fourfold. I think he surprises us with little glimpses of his chugging. He is aware that his readers know more than he does about cows and birds and Stalinism and cashew nuts, for example, and he does not try to overreach himself. He does overreach himself on the Mad clanging of bells in mad bell towers in a mad country, but he does so persuasively and in spades. Then there is almost grating acknowledgement of those who allowed him to listen to the tape recordings. I confess I fought back tears and the duct still shed the audit drop now and then as I record Collect how fantastic and achievement it was to risk his bones in circumstances where you or I would have hidden behind the nest of crates panting heart hammering thumpa thumpa thumpa thumpa thump. And fourthly critically, he knows his bales. And he says so without apology without rancor without coming over all twee and Mimsy like an inspect would have done had he known a bale from a pile of pins and pencils, or some other sopan SAP is vulgarity. What we're left with is something we can all be proud of standing on a bridge in blistering sunlight, watching the sparkling river below us flowing relentlessly to a destination we can never even imagine reaching. Even if night crashes down around our ears 1000 times 1000 thousand times in this land it would be bonkers to disavow it is on that bridge I stand. I do not think pebble head would recognize me now. And I know for certain that in spit if by some miracle his bones leaped up out of the deep and snap themselves together into human form. And we're enfleshed and quick with life. Even then, in spip would know me not for I have read the book. And it is as if I were truly there flattering and bright pitched past picture of Granger in those jog band sappan SOP days.

Ever mindful of the need to trim the wicks of his tallow candles. Dobson employed for the purpose a tiny pair of shears which he deployed using the so called botsman maneuvers. I took against electricity from an early age he wrote lying shamelessly and often found myself in a quandary because untrimmed wicks set my teeth on age. For a long time I thought the remedy for this was to imbue my teeth with greatest strength foolish young pup that I was. I crunched nuts morning noon and night nuts have many different kinds. I had no favorites in the nut world. Although of course, the harder than that, and the greater the effort needed to crunch it into a digestible pap but hardier my teeth became and the better they could withstand being set on edge by the appearance of untrimmed wicks on the tallow candles I used to illuminate my habitat. By his own account, a temporary nachhaltige forced Dobson to re address the problem, but official statistics give the light of this. Indeed, at the point where the pamphleteer adopted the blockman maneuvers, there was a nut glut in the land. According to pokok and gabbeh test, the squirrel population had been decimated by unexpected lupine savagery, leaving millions of nuts on hidden if there was no lack of nuts what made Dobson nail his colors to blockman mast it's significant that this time unlike later, Dobson's colors were cherry and done, and that a new blockman master had been erected a top pill garlic Hill, not far from the pig farmers heart where Dobson had regular sunrise Gleanings. The sighting of the mast illegal then has now was a stroke of genius by the blots. minist earned over bonds through album z, who had smuggled himself into the country aboard a packet steamer some months earlier. intriguingly No sooner had gone through albums he disembarked from the boat the googie withers, then it's Captain scuppered, it set it ablaze and promptly vanished. Some say the captain still haunts the warehouses down at the harbor, rattling an old tin cup and begging for arms from the rough tough sailors they're about. Other Stories have the one time packet steamer Captain retired to the countryside keeping bees like Sherlock Holmes. All it's known for certain is that a single charred plank draped from the key side was all that survived of the googie withers, and it was incorporated into a wooden altarpiece instant bibley big Dibs church where it can be seen today. If you buy a ticket from the Sexton, a monkey faced man who sits in a little Canvas kiosk in the church on each side. I afternoon awaiting redemption from the Lich gate of Sint bibley. Babe Dibs looking westward on a clear day, one can see the top of the botsman masked with it cherry and dumb pennants. Turning to the east, the prospectors of fields rippling with wheat and rhubarb and Holly hawks and stink word punctuated by haha hours and the occasional Scarecrow. No wild jabbering pigs are to be seen, for they were eradicated by the same unexpected lupine savagery, which did for the squirrels during the nut glut. Just at the time, Dobson falsely claimed a nut shortage led to his adoption of the botsman maneuvers as his favored way of trimming the tallow candle wicks, the uncleanness of which set his teeth on edge so but why did Dobson forever deny his association with earn Owens three albums he decades later when it was put to the pamphleteer that he and the untidy blockman night had been fast friends, often cooped up together for days on end in the pig farmers hut on the hill, scheming and plotting and cackling and letting sawdust trail through their fingers, reading the runes. Dobson blushed as he protested that the name von strathalbyn z meant nothing to him. He came up with improbable tales to account for his whereabouts on certain days when it was suspected, the blockman mast had been activated, and he was never able to explain how he had learned to trim his wicks so definitely, with the tiny shears are central to the botsman maneuvers. The one time he mentioned the shares in a pamphlet, he is curiously abrupt. In 10, short essays on chopping and cutting and hacking, he gives full vent his thoughts on scissors and seminars and pastry cutters, for example, devoting over 20 pages to the latter alone. There is detail here are plenty for the student who wishes to learn from scratch how to cut

up bits of pastry in hundreds of different ways. Yet, not only is there not a separate essay about the tiny shares, they are only mentioned in a footnote, and in such small type that only the most assiduous of readers is likely to be bothered with it. I freely admit that I've not read it myself, and rely entirely upon the account of the footnote given in the latest issue of marginalia. daab Sonia the scholarly journal edited by Allah wishes nesting bird. Now here's the thing. parish records seem to show that nesting bird is directly related to earn over bonds through albums, he may indeed be his grandson. If true, it would explain a lot, although I'm not entirely sure what precisely is explained, and nesting bird has never replied to any of my letters. Last week, I fired off a short questionnaire to him, demanding what they call full and Frank answers to over a dozen accusations. I wanted to know if he had copies of the construction plans for the botsman mask or for any similar masks if he ever worshiped at the wooden altar incent baby babe Dibs, and if he did what God he worship there. And did he worship standing up sitting, kneeling or sprawled prostrate on the cold stone floor? I pumped him for an answer to the important question of whether he knew the name of the captain of the packets the mo googie withers and what had become of that mysterious old sea dog. I threw in a sneaky query about the accounting procedures of his scholarly journal. Convinced as I am that the prophets are being salted away to fund the salt mines, from which far flung members of the nesting bird clan draw bear dubious salaries. I asked all this and more, but of course got nothing in return, not even the threats I have become used to from the badly dressed buffoon. I know for a fact that it is nesting bird or one of his cronies, who has sullied my reputation with the electricity people and with the gas people too, and that both utilities have cut off supplies to my seaside cabin. And that is why I like Dobson before me now rely upon candle light and well trimmed wicks. To date, I have not had to resort to the blocks but maneuvers for wicks not neatly trimmed have yet to set my teeth on edge. If they do with much bluster I shall begin to crunch nuts and nesting bird will be laughing on the other side of his pasty face. I will crunch nuts and cackle and be righteous and rooty toot

More about Dobson they've stolen Dobson's brain.

Frank Key  25:26
Such a hullabaloo there was when they discovered Dobson's brain had been stolen. One cub reporter called it the Halla boo Lou to end all Hala belews. Initially beside herself, marigold Chu soon grew to appreciate the peace and quiet the unhallowed Balu in the house itself, where Dobson lay perfectly still, as if asleep on a mattress. She painted and sang and fed the squirrels in the garden. Occasionally she tiptoed into the room where Dobson lay sprawled, and examine the sutures on his skull. The police scientist agreed with her that it looked like a professional job. Detective Captain kargh pan was convinced that the pamphlet his brain was being kept in a jar within a 10 mile radius, and waited patiently for a ransom note. There was further hullabaloo when a picture was sent to the daily screech purporting to show the brain on a platter, but painstaking analysis showed that it was just a gray lump of dough. Some wonder if a Holic pooch would find Dobson's brain while rummaging in a hedgerow in a curious foreshadowing of the theft and recovery of the jewel ram a trophy in 1966. A year later, marigold to listen to her Xavi a coup gat LPs attended her hollyhocks and pasted cuttings into her scrapbook. Detective Captain Kirk pan filled his pipe with untreated Uruguayan tobacco and paste up and down the garden path, praying for rain. He believed that a torrential downpour would flush out the brain thieves. Time passed and the hullabaloo died down and the cub reporter on the daily screech was embedded with a different police force investigating a different case. And then, despite the weather remaining barmy and some battered one Thursday morning, the posty came prancing along the lane carrying a package detective Captain kargh pan let marigold chew on rapid fire she was deft where he was a butter fingers. She said, Gosh, actually folded aside the last layer of blotting paper to reveal the pamphleteers brain. It was rather muddy as if it had been kept in a ditch, but she rinsed it thoroughly under the garden spigot and handed it to the police scientist who scampered upstairs and reinserted it into Dobson's head. No one ever did find out who had stolen it or where it had been stored, or whether any experiments have been carried out on it. Detective Captain Kirk pan pursued the case for another month or two. But he was a maverick. So his manner of conducting his investigations was highly idiosyncratic and passeth all understanding.
