Good evening and a couple of minutes and light shoes of people not realizing that you need to have a kind of switchover This is hooting yard on the air. With me Frank key. Now today is the 300 and 35th anniversary of the release from Newgate prison of a lot of wick Muggleton had not been there very long, he was held on the default of an unpaid fine and then managed to cobble the money together. But thereafter, the 19th of July was celebrated annually as the little holiday by the religious sect, to which he gave his name, the Mughal Toni ins. It was in February 16 51, that the London Taylor john Reeve received a commission from God. God x, sorry, Reeve explained to Magilton his cousin, also a tailor, that they were the two witnesses spoken of in the book of Revelation 11 three, and I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they show prophecy 1203 score days closed in sackcloth. rave died a few years later in 1658, leaving Magilton to continue their work and to give the sect his name. Was that work? It was one of the key tenets of the Mughal Tony ins that have been created man, God took a step back and took no interest whatsoever in our everyday doings. Mughal Tony ins did not preach nor proselytize. They had no form of organized worship, and indeed, hardly any organization at all. What they did do was meet up usually in taverns, and talk, often rancorous Lee, and sing Mughal Tony and songs. They also had holidays, where they might choose a picnic spot instead of a tavern for talking and singing on the little holidays, the 19th of July, and on the great holiday from the second to the fourth of February, celebrating john Reeves his initial revelation. Among the muggle Tony and other believers would that God had literally made man in his image. He was five feet six inches tall, or possibly six feet of topic for rain. chorus discussion, and he lived in heaven, which was exactly six miles above the earth surface separated by the sky, which was a solid band. When hot air ballooning was invented the Mughal Tony in the band it on the grounds that a balloon would crash into the sky. man's greatest enemy was not the devil who did not exist, but reason which for humans was unclean and filthy. Pure Reason was the preserve of the angels. Though there was no formal worship or prayers, one thing that Mughal Toni ins did like to do was to pronounce curses upon those who disagreed with them. A lot of wick McGlothin himself was particularly scornful of the Quakers with their belief in a holy spiritual God and devoted an entire pamphlet to cursing them. The splendidly titled the neck of the Quakers broken or cutting Sunder by the two edged sword of the Spirit, which is put into my mouth 1663 also in receipt of a muggle Tony and curse was so Walter Scott. In his novel Woodstock or the Cavalier 1826, a character named Tonkin's makes a violent end, Scott regret that, quote, his brains have not been beaten out in his cradle, unquote, to prevent him growing up into quote, one of those muggle Tony Ian's on quote. For this, he was cursed by Robert Wallace and Michael Tony and from his LinkedIn. It might come as a surprise that a seemingly disorganized sect was still active, still cursing, still taking holiday picnics in the 19th century. But the Mughal Toni ins lasted longer than that. In 1979, one Philip Noakes of Sevenoaks in Kent, bequeath to the British Library and Archives of Mughal Tony and documents, he's thought to have been the last surviving Mughal toniann but who knows, there may be still others talking and singing in the corner of a pub, or picnicking below a sunny sky, six miles under heaven.

There are circumstances in which you might find yourself standing in a field alongside a Scandinavian peasant staring at the sky. The peasant may turn to you and say, Morgan the Rhoda gear daga below de covered throw their gear daga soda. What is an appropriate response? You could of course remain silent while molding your countenance into an expression of sagacity, a slight furrowing of the brow, a person of the lips, an intense look in the eyes, perhaps and almost imperceptible nod of the head. You could even rub your kin thoughtfully, as Mr. Carter does in the Jennings and darbishire books by Antony Puckeridge. The Scandinavian peasant would almost certainly take this as guru acknowledgement. This is the safest course of action if you have no idea what he's babbling on about. But it may be that you have a smattering of some Scandinavian languages or a wearing a hidden earpiece, which provides you with a simultaneous translation. Both are possibilities if you are for example, a diplomat or a special rapporteur of the United Nations. There may be other reasons why one or both is the case, such as family background or the habit of international jet setting for either business or leisure purposes. Your knowledge your earpiece, well thus apprise you of the meaning of the peasant utterance, which can be given as morning read gives wet days, evening read gives sweet days. Armed then, with the knowledge that the peasant is spouting rustic wisdom, or weather law, you may wish to consider a verbal response. You can still do the whole business with the brow on the lips and the eyes and the head The chin, but this time as a preliminary Gambit. Then you might counter with a countryside adage of your own. For example, red sky at night, Shepherd's delight, red sky in the morning, fisherman's warning. Or, if the field in which you are standing alongside the Scandinavian peasant is within the vicinity of the sea, or of a few word, you might say, red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red Sky at morning, sailors take warning. The problem with this approach is that the Scandinavian peasant may be prompted to back back a further piece of his own rustic wisdom, to which you will feel compelled to supply a rejoinder. You will swiftly find yourself embroiled in an escalating exchange of countryside Proverbs, which you cannot when he is a peasant, and you are not, he will always be able to top your soul with something more abstruse. Born of generations of experience telling the Scandinavian field, you should therefore deploy a different tactic. Instead of following the brow on the lips, and the eyes and the head and the chin business with a cup plate of weather law, you should allow a significant pause, and then say, and in the morning, it will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and luring. Oh ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky. But can you not discern the signs of the times? This is a biblical quotation from the Gospel of Matthew 16. Three, assuming for one moment that the Scandinavian peasant does not take it personally, it's likely that he will be stunned into silence, like a dumb ox. You then have the advantage, but bear in mind the possibility that he does take it personally and think you are accusing him wildly of hypocrisy. He may be a violent peasant, and lift up his spade to bash him above that about the head. If you're wearing a hidden earpiece, a basketball this logic and you will no longer have the simultaneous translation to let you know what he's saying. To prevent this happening, you should have in your pocket some kind of treat with which to placate him. A piece of smoked and dried herring will usually suffice. You should keep it wrapped in greaseproof paper to avoid sullying the lining of your pocket. There is, however,

the possibility that may he may be a Bible thumping Scandinavian peasant, as familiar with the Old and New Testament as he is with whether law if this is the case, he may respond to your Matthew 16 three with say his Isaiah 3616 to 17. During drik var och en vatten Ethan Braun, Tara Zhang, comma, aka Todd dig bought. This will put you in something of a pickle, unless you have the measure of his Bible learning and how could you you have no guarantee that you will be able to match him quote for quote, remember, he may well be a Lutheran, you will need to be pretty damn confident of your own store of memorized biblical verses to embark upon a tit for tat. Weighing things in the balance, your best option is to reply drinky everyone the waters of his own system, until I come and take you away. by merely echoing back at him the Authorized Version version of his own Sally, you may well succeed in bringing the exchange to a close, neither of you has out with it the other but neither of you has a lost face. He can take up his spade and go off to tell his fields in a peasanty way and you can wander off in the opposite direction to your holiday chalet or special rapporteurs concrete pillbox or wherever it is you are staying. When both of you have walked about 20 paces, you might turn and wave to each other in amicable farewell. The next morning or evening when you encounter each other again in the field. You will both be better prepared and companionable silence will almost certainly be appropriate Next week in our series on conversational Gambit with Scandinavian peasant, we will look at the best approach should you find yourself talking of the varying merits of agricultural implements. For your homework, make a list of farm implements mentioned in the Bible, using as your sources, both the Authorized Version and a Scandinavian language Lutheran edition.

Every now and then I ponder whether it will be a good idea to abandon always hooting yard Hurry, and instead devote my energies to writing a blockbuster. In my mind's eye, I see the shelves of airport bookstores groaning under the weight of sundry copies of a thick paperback with golden boss lettering on the cover. I further imagined staring at a computer screen on which my earnings from royalties and commercial licensing deals are continually updated. The numbers growing huge with every passing second. Meanwhile, the telephone doesn't stop bringing, as calls come in from Hollywood agents desperate to obtain the film rights. And then I think, why bother writing the blockbuster? Why not just go straight to the film script? I've never actually attempted to write a screenplay. But it can't be that difficult. Well, maybe it is, but needs must when the devil drives. The devil drives might have been a good title for my film script a few years ago when Hollywood was enamored of Satan and all his work. But I suspect the time for a road movie in which Beelzebub drives across America wreaking fiendish nests at every turn has passed. vampires and zombies see more of the thing these days. But that's a pharaoh well plowed already. So I decided to play a game of protagonist location Literary Reference, or prologue literary for short. This is a pastime I devised myself, you get a set of bleak blank playing cards, and divide them into three listeners with their wits about them will know what to do next, but for any plots and dialogues drooling their way through this, the idea is that on one set of cards, you write the names of various protagonists on another, a variety of settings or locations. And on the third, some interesting literary bitty Bobs, be they names of authors or book titles or anecdotes or what have you. You then splat the cards facedown in three groups upon a large flat surface, such as an ice rink and pick one card from each. That's how I arrived at the idea for my screenplay, which involves an underpants bomber on a submarine, also aboard which a Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. This seems to me to have the potential to be a surefire multiplex hit. I've heard that Hollywood producers sometimes like to have a wild card element in a plot some little thing to differentiate the film from 1000 others. In this case, I think that having Ted Hughes aboard the sub, actually it might be a u boat, we could introduce a stowaway CRO. This would add so many frissons I can't begin to count them. Already, I'm carried away with mine with enthusiasm and imagining scenes which I will somehow have to fit into the script. Ted and Sylvia are kissing and drawing blood from each other as they tended to do the underpants bomber being revealed to have a morbid fear of crows, the U boat captain, who I suppose will have to be portrayed negatively shouting orders in German with subtitles while water from a leaking pipe dripped from the brim of his Captain cap. Madden classes to would no doubt complain and even pick it the cinemas if QED got to hang out with a u boat CRO without Sylvia's enthusiasms being equally catered for. So perhaps she could have a box full of bees in the cargo hold. I realized that we would be skittering a little close to Snakes on a Plane territory, bees in a u boat, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. It could also provide the pretext for a scene in which the bees somehow get into the underpants, bombers, underpants and either Trigger or disable the bomb, what the CRO might be up to at the time. I have not yet worked out, probably purging a top Ted's head calling. Though it would be tempting to portray the underpants bomber as a bearded jihadist nutcase, I would like the film to be a little more subtle. I'm also bearing in mind television showings where at least in Europe, the Muslim character always turns out to be innocent. Even saintly, in spite of being a prime suspect early on, perhaps we would need to cast someone like Tom Hanks as the terrorist. The details of why he has a bomb in his underpants can

be worked on. Perhaps it was placed there against his will, by Silvia, or by Ted and Sylvia working in unison. There are various possibilities. And the great thing is that all packed with thrills and spells. I've mentioned that there has to be a lot of water leaking into the U boat, which is old and riddled with metal fatigue, seals and bolt Creek and strain under the pressure as the sub dives ever deeper. It might even be heading into an abyss, a previously unknown trench on the seabed wherein billions of years ago, super intelligent alien beings formed a colony. No, no, I'm not gonna go there. Actually, why make a one off film, when surely 12 or 24 episode television series would prove more lucrative. This would necessitate having all the actors speaking Danish and wearing chunky knitwear, which might get saddened by all the leaking water. But there would be time to winter all sorts of subplots, and also to explore the complex past and the relationships between the characters. Is the captain an old flame of silvius? Is the underpants bomber, a failed poet with a grudge against Ted is the captain a secret Muslim? I don't know if the Danes have or had u boats. But a little tweaking of history is forgivable. Clearly, I have a lot of work to do pulling all the strands together. But quite frankly, I can't see this failing to be a popular success.

I think we're gonna have to cut the show a tiny bit short this week. I would have had time to read more had I started earlier, but never mind. So what I wanted to do was to read you a piece about pointy town, which was prompted by my conviction, which shared I'm glad to say by certain other people that the shard the whopping great skyscraper, the new, whopping great skyscraper in London, which is certainly the tallest building in London. Maybe the biggest building in Britain, I don't know. But anyway, the shard, would you show you some pictures of it, even if you've done in London in yourself. I'm sorry, but it's not pointy enough. It should have been much much point here than it is. And in fact, I understand that in the original plans. It was point here, but for some reason, they seem to have stopped short of making it properly pointy. So I wish to complain about this in the strongest terms. And in doing so. I wrote a piece on the hooting yard website about pointy town, which you can go and read. But if all else goes well, I'll read it to you on the show next week. Yeah, what else? Well, as I as you as I often prompt you to do, go to the hooting yard website. And while you're there, you might like to buy some books, or even send me some money, but always very welcome. And you always get my deep, deep, bottomless gratitude. Anyway, to finish off this week, I thought I'd read you a quotation. I recently read the rise and fall of the man of letters by john gross, published in 1969, which basically follows The Rise and Fall of the man of letters in England, England and Britain from about 1800 to about 1960, which was when published in 1969. Anyway, one of the figures he covers is the almost forgotten the finger of George Sainsbury 1845 to 1933. And he was also a saint, he was also a teacher. And here is a quotation from the book about George Sainsbury. His students realized that they had a legend on their hands and made the most of it. Dozens of stories circulated about his rumbustious aside is impossible handwriting and the convolutions of his syntax. In the Sainsbury Memorial volume, a former student recalled learning a specimen sentence by heart. But while none save these have many living had done, or could have done such things, there was much here which whether either could have done it or not, neither had done I'm gonna read that to you again, with with the punctuation added to help you so you can write it down, memorize it, and use it next time you're at a sophisticated cocktail party. But while none comma, save these comma of many living comma had done comma, or could have done comma, such things, comma, there was much here which dash whether either could have done it or not dash, neither had done. That's a fantastic sentence. And ever since I read that, I memorized it, and I use it on numerous occasions, sometimes completely out of context. But there you go. That's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I will be back next week, and I'll tell you all about why the shard is not pointy enough. Bye bye
