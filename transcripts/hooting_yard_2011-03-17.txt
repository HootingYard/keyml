Good evening, this is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. Right then you've just heard a little advert there for the fundraiser, marathon weekend, on Saturday and Sunday. And one of the items that will be, you'll be able to bid for at the auction. Probably the thing that will, I don't know, I expect bidding will probably start thousands and thousands of pounds. All of which will go directly into the pockets of resonance FM is anywhere This item is a set of six set of six books about Ugo of Plovdiv and his power off and his blind Ma. Now, this, the these these little booklets were published in 2004, in an edition of I think, 12, or possibly 10. And so it's an exceedingly rare item set of six total books. And I thought, I mean, I'll probably end up doing this on Sunday anyway, during the fundraiser weekend. But I thought as a special treat. On the this week show, I would read all six of these books to you. So we'll begin. Excuse me, we'll begin with the first three. And we'll end the show. With the other three, there are six in all. And the first one. Oh, I should point out that these are spinalis out of print pamphlets. And they're illustrated throughout with great masterpieces of Western art, or details in black and white, badly photocopied in some cases reasonably well photocopied from great masterpieces of Western art. The first one is called ooh go goofs off. And it's a tale for tiny tots. Ugo lived in Plovdiv in the fog Ooh, go goofed off. There you go. Ooh, go goofing off again said who goes Ma. It was foggy. Ooh, goes stepped in some goo. He got it on his boots. Who goes ma gave him a rag to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a drawer full of Google's goals and rags. Who goes ma was blind. So when Udo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened the drawer of Googles and rags and rummaged she was rummaging for a rag rather than a Google for if she gave Ugo a Google he wouldn't get the goo off his boots. But with a rag he would go sat in the porch of the goofing off and wipe the goo off his boots with a rag in the fog in Plovdiv.

And the second book in the series is called ooh goes POW off a tail for Chin's in Plovdiv. Ooh go had a POW called off. Off had the plague. Look at my Bubo, Ugo said off. Eu said EU go when he saw the Bubo. Eu go had the flu. His mom made him a tincture for his flu. But there was not much she could do about ofs Bubo in the Plovdiv. lazaretto off mooched about in a foul mood, Ugo and egos ma brought food for all. Have some pancakes off, said Ooh, go off gobbled a pancake. Fabio From me to poopoo you off, said ooh goes Ma. But you should put the pancake on your Bubo, like a poultice. I'll said, Oh, he did as bed, and soon his Bubo was gone. But Ugo still had the flu. So his mom was thrown for a loop. She could cure the plague, but not the flu and did no not and did not know what else she could do for the time being in the lazaretto in Plovdiv.

And number three is called egos pod, a tale for tinies. In the Old Town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stall. Who goes ma said, ooh, go, why are you using a pod instead of a jar? Who goes mom was blind, but she knew that the palapa vagos pod was different to the plop of his job. Omar said, ooh, go, my job is in the shed. Who goes Mar bash to go on the head? Never leave your job in the shed. Ooh, go. She said. When you do, I will bash you on the head. As I just did. Ugo said, Sorry, Ma, my power off, put my jar in the shed. Ah, said who goes ma on Thursday last in our hovel in the old town of Plovdiv.

So there were the first of the three Ugo books, which you can, which you probably heard me turning the pages see here and you can turn those very pages if you are the highest bidder for that set of six books at the weekend. Onwards now, with the promise of three more to come before the end of the show. This is called fruiter as a gleam ego isn't in it. There was a gleam in the eye of the fruit or his dog was worrying a toffee apple wrapper in the drain. He sold me a cow's bad plum. He was a traveling fruiter and he soon went on his way swing swinging his basket. The dog did not immediately follow some yards along the lane. The fruit are stopped and turned his head and called out to the dog. The dog's name was flaps. Here flaps, cried the traveling fruiter in a rich baritone that would have done him credit on the stage. flaps relinquish the toffee apple wrapper and scampered towards his master and continued beyond him along the lane. panting I have no idea what sort of dog It was. It was soon out of sight. But the fruiter did not appear at all worried. He continued on his way more slowly than his dog. on the spur of the moment, I decided I wanted to buy a second cows bad plum. I got up from the lane side bench on which I had been sitting and followed as a fruit juror. I did not call out to Him for the simple reason that I am mute. When I was but tiny I was witness to an abomination. You can draw your own inference from that pair of snippets. In any case, I'm sure the traveling fruiter is a more interesting character than I am. With the gleam in his eye on his theatrical voice and his swinging basket and his dog flaps. He is the type to gain attention whether he wishes to or no. I, by contrast, could have sat all day upon the bench without attracting the attention of passing persons or dogs or above birds. The fruiter himself would have strode on past oblivious, had I not hailed him and brought him to a halt to buy my cows bad plum. voiceless my hailing method was to flail my arms with a wave a stick now to buy as an afterthought, a second Carlsbad plum. I had to catch up with him further along the line. So I sprinted. Doing so took me back in reverie to my youth when I won many a medal running round and round and athletic track wearing a singlet to which both numbers were attached both front and back. I usually wore the number nine on older and creakier now and I was puffed out by the time I came alongside the traveling Futura panting like flaps, I slowed to match the fruit rose pace. I held off the Carlsbad plum I had already bought, and with my other hand pointed at the fruit or his basket, and by some other signals made plain to him that I wanted to buy a second Carlsbad plum. To reflect this transaction. We both stopped dead on the lane. Looking up ahead, I saw flaps mixture rating against the trunk of a lonely yew tree. The fruit for handed me a second Carl's bad plum, and in turn, I gave him some coinage. There was still a gleam in his eye, a gleam so resplendent it dazzled me on it seldom dazzled by fritters in this day and age. Lord knows how much water flaps of lap from his bowl or from a reel that morning, for even as I was bedazzled by the fruit rose gleam, I saw out of the corner of my eye that his dog continued to expel a stream of piss against the you tree in an unstoppable flow. I worried he might poison the roots. The yew tree would wither and Woods men with axes would come to chop it down, and it would be all the fault of flaps.

and by extension of the fruit for wood, his eyes still gleam when in a far town a year hence, he sat at a tavern table drinking his pot, and read in the local paper of the shriveled and felled yew tree, and cast his mind back to that summer's morning, when he sold a brace of Carlsbad plums to a mute, and flats relieved himself his jet of canine peice, powerful and prolonged drenching the trunk of that very huge, free sinking, and seeping through the soil, weathering the root.

I recently read an excellent book by Jessica Warner, in titled craze, grin and debauchery in an age of reason, published in 2003. And among the things are reading this book, it's not a very long book, but it's full of fascinating things. And among the things in this book was what Jessica Warner says is a complete list of victims of spontaneous human combustion in literature from 1798 to 1893. And so I'm going to let you know if anyone can turn up a case of spontaneous human combustion in the literature between those dates, which is not included. I'd be happy to hear about it. And I'm sure Jessica Warner would too, for the next edition of her book. Anyway, here it is a complete list of victims of spontaneous human combustion in literature from 1798 to 1893. the narrator's father in the land by Charles brocton, brown 1798. William the testee in knickerbockers History of New York by Washington, Irving 1809. A woman in Jacob faithful by Captain Mary at 1834. a blacksmith in dead souls by Nikolai Gogol 1842 Sir Paul hawks fan tremens in the Glen Munchkin railway by William edmundston a tune 1845 The sailor Miguel Saavedra in red burn by Herman Melville 1849. Mr. crook in Bleak House by Charles Dickens 1852 53 the whiskey sodden and derelict Jimmy Flynn in life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain 1883 a character in Dr. Pascal by Emil Zola 1893 that list does not include the female cook in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. 1847 who was merely quote, in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion. Unquote.

Take care, deckhand with mob, as a large nautical portrayed done in emotion by the rule akademischen tranfer tick type. Apart from the vast swathes of brightly colored emotion with which was executed. The notable feature of the painting is the hideous countenance of the deckhand accountants so hideous that none can look upon it without in an instant, becoming gibbering Li insane. In this respect, the painting is akin to some factory with melodramatic incident in a story by HP Lovecraft. Yet the effect of that hideous deckhands countenance is regrettably all too real. As a brief visit to the locked ward of the grim bleak, windswept granite asylum perched on the hillside makes clear, there one will find gibbering and insane a gaggle of art critics and newspaper hags who were present at the paintings unveiling. But what of chamfered tick tape himself? How did he paint in suedes of brightly colored emotion, the hideous countenance of the deckhand without himself succumbing to gibbering into insanity. For years the noted royal academician has refused to speak of his painting, referring all inquiries to his PR toady a master of obfuscatory follow the role at various times this slippery fellow has hinted either the artist was blindfolded as he painted, or that his brain was protected by a mysterious Cara pace, or that he prepared a painting by numbers grid and directed the execution from behind the screen. His assistance then being carted off one by one, to the very same grim, bleak, windswept, granted asylum perched on the hillside, where they're kept in a separate wing also locked, in which they dribble insanely while sucking on wafers. Not one of these tales is likely to be true. Some say the deck hand is a self portrait of the painter. But how could that be chamfer ticker tape is a man about town, sweeping in and out of fashionable restaurants and nightspot in Cape and muffler pursued by pepper xe, and he does not leave in his wake of trail of the gibbering and insane my own theory is that when viewing this gigantic painting done in emotion, one must keep one's eyes fixed steadily on the mob, the mob, the mob.

Thinking there was a shrew in her yard. Who goes blind Mark tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv through patrol patrol. But who go started to sound like a goose? Who said who goes ma?
