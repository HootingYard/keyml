Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM. And I'm Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. I've been away for a couple of weeks. I was in the United States, and among other things. While I was there, I met a fanatical devotee of Jethro Tull, who insisted on calling them the towel. But though he was ofay with the entire discography, personnel and everything else, of just rotala band, he didn't know that they named themselves after the 18th century English inventor of the seed drill. So I was able to add to his dresser Oh, towel information bank. What else happened? I nearly I Well, I was tempted to have a haircut at Kim's precision haircuts in San Francisco. Although I wasn't entirely sure what a precision haircut was. And oh I, I visited the well visited outside the Willy woo woo won children's playground. without children. Of course, I didn't go in because I didn't want to be arrested. And in fact, it was empty of children at the time. I later discovered that Willy woo woo won is or was a legendary diminutive Chinese American Basketball Player. And what else? And I met a couple who had many pets and among their pets, was an eel called peaches. Unfortunately, I didn't make pictures of the eel, but I was told that he or she or possibly it had a very winning personality. So if those of you who doubt that eels have personalities, apparently they do. But onwards onwards. cadmium, so soft, so duck tile, so bluish white, so by Vaillant, so high in fatigue resistance, and yet so toxic, is there a better metal with which to electroplate your bird table? Not according to hooting yards bird table electroplating expert saga Mantis trumpet, who has this to say whether you spell Starling the usual way or get it confused with starlin One thing is for sure, all starlings love to alight on a bird table to peck millet and bread crust put out for them by owner theologically minded citizens. And not just starlings but other birds too, such as Robbins and goshawks and linnets. But in a climate where it seems always to be raining, where wild wind how where eerie mist descend, and the air grows thick and muggy before great cataclysmic storms wreak ruination even the best made birth table will rot away and topple sooner or later. by Christ, I have seen numberless collapsed bird tables in my time, never without shedding tears, as I then look up into the bleak expansive skies to see flocks of starlings and other birds, Kitty wakes and swift and crows, Skirling and swooping, but with no sturdy uncoupled bird table upon which to land and take sustenance from the province of their freely scattered by their human pals. It is a tragedy as old as time best evoked, I think, in that terribly sad opera by booth, the collapsed bird tables of Verona. Trump has more to say much more, but as a sign of the great soap making family she has a tendency to prattle on and I think we can safely interrupt. The point is that she has gathered a vast trove of information on cadmium electroplated tables and plans to make it available via a new web hub portal with listings, prices and specifications plus a bulletin board chat room Witter feed, wiki, forum, blog, Stump, and rivets, all powered by bronto. I'm not sure what all that means, but I'm copying from scribbled notes which may not be entirely accurate. Trump was making her announcement on a lawn on a common and had to contend with the racket made by a petrol powered mowing machine, a brass band and a very noisy swarm of Hornets.

Further details will follow once Sargon and his trumpet actually sets up the website, which she plans to do as soon as it's safe to release her from the remote isolation clinic where she's being held following a severe bout of cadmium poisoning. I'm not sure why she felt it necessary to, in her words, become a bird table, complete with cadmium electroplating in order to really get with the program, but that's what she did. And now she's paying the price. Hats off to her sigh

it's almost exactly a year since Woolworth collapsed and disappeared from our high streets. And at the time. About a year ago, I wrote this. Wall worth is no more said a headline I spotted in a newspaper. I didn't quite grasp what it meant. So I ruminated as I do whenever I encounter something perplexing. My usual method is to stare out of the window waiting enlightenment. So that's what I did. I felt it would have been immense help if the view from my window was on a hillside with a lot of sheep on it, but I'm afraid to say that all I could see was the perimeter fence of a derelict shopping precinct. Had I been able to see some sheep, I could have grabbed a pair of binoculars and examined closely the fleeces of the sheep, assuming they will unshared to ascertain why they will no longer had any worth and the absence of any useful visual prompt, I was forced to rely upon the cerebral activity buzzing within the confines of my skull. A skull I should add, that has won plaudits from a number of highly competent phonologists Dr. Bramble gak described it as impeccably cranial with lovely dense. After gazing at the collapsing retail hub for a few hours, I reached some preliminary conclusions about wall having no worth. I shall present them to you now, with the proviso that you keep them under your hat until I give the all clear. There is no pressing reason for secrecy, but I find it adds a free song of excitement to the daily round. For example, when I pop out to buy a pint of milk or a packet of surprisingly delicious vegan pork style scrapings, I will sometimes pretend that I've been sent on a mission by SMERSH and loiter outside the shop muttering into a concealed walkie talkie for an hour or so. My first provisional conclusion is that wall has gone bad or become contaminated in some way, and is therefore to be shunned on health grounds. It follows from this that sheep are carriers of bad wall and must be cold. Few save for the bloodthirsty would willingly slaughter innumerable sheep, so quarantine may be preferred to a cow. If a secure area of sufficient acreage can be found. Helicopters could hover over the site, ensuring no sheep made a run for it after bounding over the barbed wire fence. My second provisional conclusion is that wall has lost its worth due to a glut. This would not be the first wall collapse in history, but perhaps the most severe one. The best way to address the glass is to identify new uses for wall to stimulate demand. Coupled with an authoritarian approach the surplus wall was soon get used up. So step one is to issue a decree that anyone not making conspicuous daily use of the new wall based product such as woolly satnav, woolly catnip, wooly bubble bath and wooly fireworks would be shot on site. My third provisional conclusion is a simple one well has had its time and that time has passed and we must strive onwards to a bright new utopia under the benevolent gaze of the great Helms woman, beachy Hazel Blears or at a push agneta. Felt Skog. Although I would not wish to prod you towards one or other of my conclusions, it ought to be noted that I wrote this piece. I typed it entirely with a wall board, a thrilling new computer style keyboard made out of one of made out of 100%, uncontaminated wall.

So having been abroad, I returned to London and being back in London, I read this. This is a quotation I'll tell you where it's from when I finished reading it, such as the immensity of this metropolis. So innumerable are its thoroughfares and so widely separated it's districts that one who had passed half a lifetime at the West End of London might well be excused for entire ignorance as to the situation of Bethnal Green, Jacob's Island, Mile End and Stepney they are as vaguely remote to many as the ultimate fool of Orkney or Shetland. It is exceedingly probable that we have among our readers thousands who with or without a map would be utterly unable to point out the localities of Piccadilly square, honey lane, market, honey lane market, high hill, Little Britain cloth, fair Kok lane, bell square, long alley and bleeding heart yard. And people are born and run their race of life and die within a mile or two of one another, and are as completely estranged from their neighbors, as though they were separated from them by Rocky Mountains by unforgivable streams by stormy seas. This London is an amalgam of worlds within worlds. And the occurrences of every day convinced us that there is not one of these worlds that has its special mysteries, and its generic crimes, exaggeration and ridicule, often attached to the vastness of London, and the ignorance of its penetrate. Leah, common to us who dwell there in It has been said that beasts of chase still roam in the verdant fastnesses of Grosvenor square, that there are undiscovered patches of primeval forest in Hyde Park, and that Hampstead sewers shelter a monstrous breed of black swine, which have propagated and run wild among the slimy FX villains, and whose ferocious snouts will one day uproot Highgate archway while they make hollaway intolerable with their grunting. Seriously, that may be said of the Londoner who prides himself on his accurate topographical knowledge, which was said in modesty by the great philosopher of light. He is but picking up shells on the shore. While all before him, lies a vast and undiscovered ocean. It seems, however, fated of late days that the London public should hear enough, if not indeed too much of the remote and under venial region at the east end of the metropolis, murders actions for seduction, theists theological dissensions, followed by alarming riots, robberies and murderous assaults. Such eventualities as these have formed the staple of our most recent tidings from the outlying photo bogs of white chapel spittle fields, Mile End bow Stepney whopping and a robber hide to the scandalous accounts of church brawls has been lately added the ghastly revelations of the charnel house. The last importation from the East End Is the revolting story of the surreptitious disposal of the dead body of an infant, the illegitimate child of one, Elizabeth Yorath, and which was smuggled into the earth in the coffin of an adult person, under the auspices of an undertaker in the bearer, and a clergyman of the Church of England. And that was the Daily Telegraph. The editorial in the Daily Telegraph on Monday, the 10th of October 1859. And it's quoted in a terrific book by Thomas Boyle, entitled, black swine in the sewers of Hampstead beneath the surface of Victorian sensationalism.

The following piece should be accompanied by an illustration, which is not entirely possible on the radio actually is not possible at all on the idea. However, I think it's sufficiently described in the text view to get some idea. And if if you really are desperate to see the picture, go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org and type battles against foes into the search bit, and you should find the illustration, but it's fairly well described. There comes a time in everybody's life when foes must be fought in battle. This is a universal truth assures eggs is eggs. It might be objected that some people have no photos to speak of. But that's moonshine. There is always an enemy lurking lying in wait, whether it be a marauding troupe of stiletto wielding band dt, or an inner demon, knowing the vitals. It might be further argued that one need not battle one's foe, but instead flee from them running away screaming mayhap or hiding in a bomb. much good that would do you with one of those vital was annoying types, and even external foes, such as the band ditty will be in close pursuit and track you down and have at you know, I'm afraid it's true that sooner or later, one must battle one's foes. That being the case it can be instructive to examine the historical record to consider how others have battled their foes to pick up handy tips. Here for example, we have a scene depicted in a mezzotint bother noticed mezzotints just wrecks tint. Rex tent is a particularly fab mezzotint just so we can see at a glance in the situate see at a glance, the situation he has captured so skillfully. A gigantic night in chainmail, armed with a mighty sword and a big spike thumping or bonus stick is confronted on a mountain path by a pale child threatening him with her girly pin cushion and pent up the knot is clearly in the utmost peril. His has been a life of chivalry and toonies in which he never came upon a real foe. And even when he went off on a crusade against the Sarris, and hordes. He thought of them not as enemies but as but as mere tests in Thrall to a false and fiendish God. But now on what Rex tint tells us in a scribble on the back of his mezzotint was a balmy Wednesday afternoon in the far tear role. He has come face to face with a very real and very menacing phone, the one that has awaited him, the one against whom he must do battle. Yes, he could flee. No doubt he could find a barn in which to cower like a little mouse. But the night knows his nemesis would pursue him there and find him trembling in the hayloft from which there would be no escape. He knows this is his moment of destiny, when he must battle his foe, as we all must one day, whether or not it'd be a Wednesday in the far to roll And what of this phone, this girlie in her gingham frock and corrective boots? Why does she menace the giant yet chivalrous night? How did she find him on this remote mountain path in the fall to roll? For how long has she pursued him across the globe, her pin cushion and pencil sharpener, always in readiness, their pins and blades glinting in the sunlight. When the sun is shining, or protected by rapids against rust when it is raining. What fires burn in her tiny head? Incidentally, note how Rex tenters cleverly shone her head with much larger in proportion than it ought to be, for purposes of illustrative using a mezzo tinting technique known as making the tiny bigger. Always question questions are pertinent and the answers to them would provide the knight with valuable information about his foe. Ah, but were he to pause long enough to ponder them. He would be a dead man. His guts would be spilled upon a mountain path in the fall to roll and

his foe would stand triumphantly over him one corrective boot planted on his neck by not immediately engaging his foe in battle, without stopping to think all would be lost. So the lesson we can learn from Rex tense mezzotint is clear. When battling one's foe, go on the attack, slash and slice with your sword and thump, thump, thump with your big spike thumping orb on a stick, do not stint. Whatever the specific nature of one's phone and whatever the weaponry one has to hand. Similar lessons can be learned by leafing through an album of mezzotints by Rex tent, or indeed by careful study of other pictures by other artists. The important thing is to face one's foe and do battle. Remember, if one chooses to flee, and to hide in a barn, it might turn out to be the Erie barn screen hunahpu farmyard, where look Fowler and more terrible photos than you could ever imagine. In your most hideous dreams.
