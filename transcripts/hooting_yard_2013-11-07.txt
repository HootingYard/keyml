Young girl it most of you will realize that what I just read was a list of the names given to the different markings of Shetland sheep. And you'll also know that an individual Shetland sheep can have more than one type of marking. So one could be both blankets and branded. One thing that's unclear to me is why all of the words end in other Ed or it except for Merck face.

So yes, I'm back after last week, when those of you who were listening will recall my show was replaced. And I had I had a number of letters about that about what happened in the last week. And I thought I'd read one of those letters out one of many, all more or less expressing the same thought. This letter came from someone called Eric. That's Eric Wheeler with an H. So Eric, perhaps, and Eric wrote, Dear Mr. Key I was extremely disappointed last week when I turned on my groovy transistor radio to listen to your show, and discovered it had been replaced by Miss blossom partridges weekly digest. However, the more I listened, the more I loved the show. And my initial disappointment turned to great joy as I listened to miss blossom Partridge and her weekly digest, only to be crushed with disappointment. Towards the end of the show, when she announced that someone walked into the studio and told her that her show had been cancelled. After one week, actually, not even one week, because you didn't even make it to the end of our own show. What I think you should do Mr. Key and I say this with the greatest of respect, is that you should talk to the powers that be at resonance and tell them that you would like to be put out to pasture and never do your show ever again. and invite Miss blossom Partridge back with her weekly digest every single week. So I hope never to hear from you again. You will passionately, Eric.

However, I am still here and I intend to remain here. I may have a word with the resonance people related but I'm sure that They'll not know what they'll say maybe they will put me out to pasture and replace me with Miss blossom Partridge. Who knows? Anyway, about nine years ago, which is around the time that the Who's that hooting out on the air started remarkably enough, anyway about nine years ago on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org which as I mentioned it I should mention, actually, the voting yard website is one of the five most popular websites in the entire world. Last last week, for example, we had seven visitors. Isn't that amazing? Nearly up there with nearly up there with I don't know what do Gwyneth Paltrow is website. Anyway. Go there and have a look at hooting Yod if you wish, but anyway, nine years ago I posted the following horoscope on the website read as follows. Our horoscopes are based on the so called Blodgett astrological system of six rather than 12 signs over many years forecasts made under this system have proved over 848 times more reliable than all that Pisces and Aquarius nonsense you can work out which sign you are by referring to the absolutely splendid up to date online guide at www dot Blodgett global domination.com slash human fate dot html site under construction. And here are the here are the horoscopes for the six blonde jetty and astrological signs. fruitbat.

Oh, what can al v horoscope reader alone and palely loitering? Make sure you treat yourself to an electric bath and a session in a sensory deprivation tank. The bale of gas in your house of stupidity has incalculable effect. You will stand on the steps of the insane asylum, and hundreds of men and women will stand below you with their upturned faces. Among them will be old men crushed by sorrow and old men ruined by vise aged women with faces that seem to plead for pity. Women that make you shrink from their unwomanly gaze lion like young men made for heroes, but caught in the devil's trap and changed into beasts and boys whose looks show that sin has already stamped them with its foul insignia and burned into their souls. The shame which is to be one of the elements of eternal punishment. A less impressionable person than you would feel moved at the sight of that throng of bruised and broken creatures. Ahem will be read. And when the preacher strike up an old tune, voice after voice will join in the melody until it swells into a mighty volume of sacred song. You will notice that the faces of many are wet with tears. And there will be an indescribable pathos in their voices. That pitying God amid the rapturous hallelujahs of the heavenly host shall bend to listen to the The music of these broken harps nickson vile dribbling goblins covered in boiled will make life difficult today. So, anyway, why am I returning to this? a nine year old horoscope today, you may ask? Well, for almost a decade I've been ignoring a cardboard box full of letters which I received in the days after this postage appeared on the website, the box or rather its content, nor that my conscience, nor nor nor I've had a terrible time. If you've ever felt reproached by the sight of a cardboard box, you will understand what I've been going through. That's why I hid the box in a cubby and buried it beneath a pile of rags and lock the cubby and took a bus to the seaside and held the key as far as I could into the broiling ocean. I thought by doing so I could put those letters out of mind. How could I be so naive? After almost 10 years of mental turmoil, yesterday I called a locksmith and asked him to fashion a fresh key for the cubby with commendable honesty. Given that he was turning down my custom. He pointed out that the cubby door was so flimsy or nature that even a puny person could bash it open as easily as smashing an egg. What he said, and he gave the door a sample it felt a bit and there was the pile of rags and beneath the cardboard box, and in the box, the letters. I plucked from the box, the first one that came to hand and read it. Eight years had passed, but I remembered every word. Dear Mr. Key, I'm writing to complain about the horoscope. You posted it hooting yard yesterday, I was born under the sign of Coathanger. So I was fully expecting my nightmares about an albino hand to make some sort of sense. I saw a range things that I spent the day in an eerie blasted landscape of marshes and more land far. Oh so far from any large buildings. I waited revelation, but revelation came there none. I can only conclude that your so called horoscope is a piece of piffle. You have ruined my life. I am going to take my case to the astrological court and you will be prosecuted and all your stars will be blotted out forever. Yours vengefully tim thurn

all the other letters with similar complaint gnashing of teeth rending of garments rage threat. Some are written in the blood of ducks, never a good sign. And I use the word sign significantly. I never responded to a single one of these misses. I thought I was in the clear. I did not know how grindingly slowly the astrological court worked. But yesterday their judgment arrived in the form of a peculiar light in the sky and a distant booming as of a phone call, or perhaps a bittern. And when night fell, I cast my gaze upwards as I always do, and the sky was empty of stars. I still believe I did no wrong. I blame Blodgett, I should appeal to the astrological court and hope for some shred of mercy in the sublunary world.

I'm so under the starlit sky. I've been reading a book by john Tim's ti MBs called things not generally known, a book for young and old Volume One. Now weirdly, this is Volume One, and it was published in 1860. And I've also got a copy of things not generally known a book for young and old Volume Two, and it was published in 1956. What can that mean? I don't know. It's very puzzling. Maybe time moved backwards in the Victorian era. Anyway, it's full of interesting stuff. as you would imagine, with a title like things not generally known, and one of the things that you may not know, and I certainly didn't, before I read, it was all about the size of English heads, or sizes of English heads. So actually, I don't know whether these figures are still accurate given that this was published in 1860. Maybe our heads have grown or shrunk in that time, but I think you'll find it interesting nonetheless. So I quote from john Tim's The following is a comparative estimate of the dimensions of the head of the inhabitant in several counties of England. The male head in England at maturity averages from six and a half to seven and five eight inches in diameter. The medium and most general size being seven inches. The female head is smaller, varying from six and three eighths to seven or seven and a half inches, the medium male size, fixing the medium of the English head at seven inches, there can be no difficulty in distinguishing the portions of society above from those below that measurement. London the majority of the higher classes are above the medium, while among the lower it is very rare to find out a large head spittle fields Weaver's have extremely small heads, six and a half 600 586 and three quarter inches being the prevailing admeasurement Coventry almost exclusively people by Weaver's the same facts are peculiarly observed. Hartford cheer, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk contain a larger proportion of small heads than any part of the Empire. Ethics and Hartford cheer particularly seven inches in diameter is here as in spittle fields and Coventry, quite unusual. six and five eighths or six and a half or more general, and six and three eighths. The usual size for a boy of six years of age is frequently to met to be met with here in the full maturity of manhood. Kent, Surrey and Sussex. An increase of size of the usual average is observed, and the inland counties in general and nearly upon the same scale, Devon shear and Cornwall the heads of full sizes, Hereford share, superior to the London average, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland and Northumberland have more large heads in proportion than any part of the country. Scotland, the full sized head is known to be possessed by the inhabitants, their measurement ranging between seven and three quarters and seven and seven eighths even to eight inches. This extreme head size however, is rare.

What I'd like to read here now is a futurist story. This is not the future ism of Mary Nettie and his Italian pals. As far as I can gather, it's simply the title of a book by Marjorie Verner Reed, published in 1919. And she called her stories futurist stories. I have read one or two of them before on the show, but long, long ago, three or four years possibly. Anyway, this is a futurist story number three by Marjorie Verner Reed published almost 100 years ago in 1919. Eagle onward to kill pillage only a few days before the lighted candles of a chapel, a young monk in prayer, quietude in his soul, the brown habit, the crucifix life forgotten. The maddening den of battle, its fury burned his soul. He had been left an orphaned child at the monastery. His name was Eagle. Some whispered he was the son of a great nobleman. None knew for sure. At first, his clean soul rebelled at the thought of war. His dark eyes flashed. Thou shalt not kill called from afar, but the cannons deafened him. They entered the courtyard into the castle Hall, had its dwellers fled along the muddy roads and fields of Belgium know, some women still a young one watching for escape, another with graying hair and soft eyes. She had stayed her sins, perhaps would be forgiven on the altar of sacrifice, burning anguish. She had sinned against God against her husband, long ago. remorse still clung in her heart. Eagle drew back, but was pushed on by others rude, boisterous toward the wind the sellers Thou shalt not kill frankly, but a breaking bottle dimmed the sound. The wine heated, wakened dormant senses more wine, with shouts and cries the suffering men came from the cellar, laughed at the woman with graying hair. She was shielding a girl whose eyes resembled eagles, the girl who had watched to escape and could not the uniform the saber. Gone was the memory of her brown habit. He came nearer. Was it a woman? He clasped her, her soft hair brushed his face. Other soldiers came, dragged her from him, fought over her like powerful beasts heating, not the mother, ego protector. In a drunken rage, he caught the girl to the open window. I'll kill her. He screamed, you who seem to know my name. The crime was spared him. Her lifeless body slim from his arms. Eagle gasp the mother, you have killed. I'll kill you. The wine had infuriated. He lifted his saber. Stop. You are my son. dazed. He heard the word but understood not.

A Night of drunkenness of horror had passed in the Belgian Chateau. The captors had damaged, broken destroyed. The sun was setting on a second day when Igor awoke. The first time in his life, he awakened from drink. He reached out expecting to find the rough wall of the monastery. He felt a dead body, the sharp edge of a saber, where orders had come. The army had there been battles, and slowly memory returned. Stop. You are my son, who had said it was it long ago? No. Only after the wine cellar. He sat up on the floor where drunkenness had overcome him. The horrible memory of his crime swept over him, his mother, he sees the body and gazed at the staring eyes. Then this was the remorse the older monks had told him had been his father's, and he, his son had plunged his saber into her heart. His own was bursting. And this girl, he had not killed her. She had died rashie his sister, only have a different father. We are through burn, a hard line played on the lips of the commander. The flames leapt from room to room, Igor, the smoke, it was overcoming him, his mother. He had forgotten how to pray. An unanswerable abyss, the horror of war. The fire blazed upward. smoke filled the room. There's the bell. He staggered to his feet. He's ringing, till brother john, tell brother john to light the candles. He walked into the flames. I am coming.

We've got a couple of minutes left. And I'm just trying to get myself properly organized here so I can read you. Some of you will know that I'm currently working on a huge compendium of potted biographies. And I've been reading some of them on the show. But being typically slapdash. I haven't been keeping a note of which ones I've read and which ones I haven't. But I thought I might read you. Redo one or two in the time we have left. And so that's what I'm going to do. The only problem is, I hope I'm not repeating myself.

Frank Key  26:36
Anyway, if I am, you'll just have to put up with it. I don't think I've read this one. This is actually it's not even a potted biography. It's a quotation from things of the curious things of the outside world last fire by Hargrave Jennings published in 1861. And he gives us a very helpful historical summary of swoons shadows, convulsions and dread. And this will take us up to the end of the show. And either I or miss blossom Partridge. We'll be back next week. And Martha SaLuSa tarnis relates to the case of a monk who fainted when he beheld a rose and never quitted his cell. While that flower was blooming, or feeler gives the account of the paint of Vincent, who was seized with violent vertigo and swooned when there were roses in the room. Voltaire gives the history of an officer who is thrown into convulsions and lost his senses by having pinks in his chamber, or fever also relates to this instance of a lady of 46 years of age of a hail constitution, who could never be present when a decoction of linseed was preparing. montane remarks on this subject, that there were men who dreaded an apple more than a cannonball, Zimmerman tells us of a lady who could not enjoy the feeling of silk and satin, and shuddered when she touched the velvety skin of a peach. Other ladies cannot bear the feel of further boil records the case of a man who experienced the natural appearance of honey. A young man invariably fainted when a servant swept his room. Boil fell into a sink cope when he heard the splashing of water. The horror that whole families entertain of keys is well known
