You are tuned to resonance 104 point four FM. And this is hooting out on the air with me Frank key for another exciting half hour of prose. And this week some music, but that will be later in the show. It came as something of a shock when I learned that my fight was written in the stars had no idea that every last particular of my life from cradle to grave was foretold in the barely visible movements, thousands and millions of miles away of fiery burning rocks scattered across the sky. As soon as I learned this, I was avid to know what lay in store for me. Only then did I realize that I couldn't actually read the stars, so I went to consult a Stargazer he ushered me into his observatory high on a promontory and tapped a spindly finger on the end of his telescope. He bade me peer through it, and I saw manifold stars impossibly distant, burning bright in the night sky. Gosh, I said, How lovely they are, yet to me, centralis devoid of meaning. That is where I come in, he said, lighting his pipe, and puffing on it with the air of a great sage. Then he laughed about with some gubbins and projecting the image seen through the telescope onto the canvas screen. See this star? He said, pointing with a pointy stick at one bright twinkle among the myriad. This is your guiding star. I could only say gosh, again. The official name of this star is b 76428. Dash 552, he said, but that's a Dallas dishwater name for a star. So as with other stars, we give it a more memorable nickname. And what is the nickname of my guiding star? I asked. We call it fascist groove Fang. He said. It is a manga cluster of stars, nicknamed after pop records made 30 odd years ago, when it was first observe through my mighty telescope. I have kept a careful eye on it ever since. That is how I knew you would come to visit me in my observatory today. Though I must have misread the signs and portent for you arrived 10 minutes later than I expected. I said the delay was on account of important roadwork, the blister lane bypass, my bus was diverted down a side road rife with loopings the Stargazer puffed his pipe even more sagely. Still, it is a conundrum and one I must puzzle out. The stars awkward for told the important roadworks. They almost certainly did. Much more likely that I somehow misread the signs and portents. I'm getting a bit slapdash in my dotage, and my eyesight is no longer what it was. Once it was piercing, like a hawk. I commiserated with him recommended some proprietary eyedrops and then begged him to reveal what the stars told him about my future. He used the pointy stick to describe arcs and angles across the screen and finally pointed once again at fascist groove Fang so bright so twinkly. Well, Yvonne Denisovich. He said, it seems that next Thursday, you will meet a tall dark stranger, you may have a stroke of good luck, and an opportunity may arise at work. Also, there may be an incident involving a dog or possibly a tortoise. Wow. I said the person who told me that my fate was laid out in detail in the stars obviously knew what they were talking about that for things that will happen on just one day of my allotted span. The stargazers countenance suddenly darkened, he took a long Sage path on his pipe, and he frowned. Hope you do not intend to ask me as so many others have done what is written upon the stars regarding the precise duration of your loss. span, he said, now

call me a fat head. But the blindingly obvious had not even occurred to me. Of course, if my fate were foretold that would include the date and indeed the circumstances of my death. Actually, no, I said, right this minute, I'm more concerned about this business with the tortoise next Thursday, the Stargazer relaxed. I did not say it would necessarily be a tortoise. I said, there might might be an incident involving a dog or a tortoise. Well, I said, Could you not pair a bit harder, or describe slightly more precise arcs and angles with your pointy stick? or do whatever it takes to read my guiding star, fascist groove thang more closely. I'd really like to know if there definitely will be an incident. And if so, whether a dog or a tortoise will be involved. And I meant it. This isn't the place to explain my preoccupation with tortoises, particularly with Thursday tortoises, but it's very real and exhausting, and occasionally, almost fatal. I can draw up a chart, said the Stargazer, which will break next Thursday down into 10 minute chunks, I'll have to observe fascist group Fang more closely through an even more powerful telescope in an even bigger observatory upon an even higher promontory. But if that's what you wish, so be it. Bear in mind that the chart will be unintelligible to one with such a puny brain as yours. So I'll have to interpret it for you. And of course, one must always take account of the vicissitudes of cloud cover. But I think I should be able to come up with a definitive narrative of events rich in detail, including even the name of the tortoise. If it turns out there is a tortoise involved in the incident. If Of course there is an incident. That would be dandy, I said, and I forked over the stargazers hefty fee. But would it be dandy? Better experience told me that taught us is on Thursday, spelled ruination and destruction of all my hopes. Ever since that picnicking fiasco in shrubbery ness, the less said about it, the better if I wish to retain my sanity. I went to sit in the stargazers waiting room, while he pootled off to a bigger observatory on a higher promontory. He hadn't told me how long it would take him to read my fate in the stars. But he said that if I went and peered through his telescope at fascist group Fang from time to time, I might be able to discern the signs and portents, of his return, and the cost of his countenance, and whether the news he brought back with him was good, or bad, or worse, even fatal. He's been gone now for six days. Tomorrow is Thursday. I have no idea what tidings he will bring, for all I've seen through his telescope is a scattering across the sky of burning fiery rocks, impossibly distant, devoid of meaning, senseless, senseless.

Here's a little song Bathsheba gubbins thou art so fair. With your crochet hooks and your bass, Alistair. come away with me to the land of trolls, where we'll live underground like a pair of moles. Bathsheba gubbins, I know I'm a chump, but meet me tonight at the village pump. Let the villagers mock. Let the villagers go up. I am are Fang Vander who couldn't drop and I shall love you till the cows come home. They're coming home now over the rain soaked loam. Which of us is not winning mawkish or maudlin mood sang those words with tears rolling down our creeks are Fang Vanda, who can dope song of love to his innamorata is both cloyingly sentimental and In its last line, not sentimental at all. Perhaps it is this duality of effect that has made it a verse adored, memorized and recited while weeping by the entire nation. Curiously, however, the nation in question is neither the country of our Fang, nor of Mrs gubbins, but the distant, possibly legendary land of 10. Tara beam in which neither of them has ever set foot, how the love song of our Fang vanger hougen dog became so Dementedly popular in that faraway land is an instructive tale. And it begins with cows, as so many things do. Some years ago, a wandering minstrel of tanto arobin wandered so far so very far that he found himself in Jay wick, the jewel of the Essex coast. clocking plopping himself on a bench outside the Never Say Die tavern, he took his Piccolo from its cotton Pichet, and prepared to play and sing. Before he could begin, however, out of the mist emerged several cows. As luck would have it. The minstrel had arrived in dry wick on the Sunday morning of what is still commemorated, at least in traywick as the day the cows came visiting, you can see a photograph of that on a website of the cows visiting traywick and tranced as who would not be the menstrual slip parties, Piccolo back in its PICHETTE unfollowed the cows in their cow we progress around the town. Being a minstrel, he composed a ditty about the experience, which he added to his repertoire. It was some years later, outside another Tavern in another town still far from his homeland, that the minstrel was interrupted in a performance of his ditty. Oh, I have traveled through many lands, but none so fair as Jay wick sands was as far as he got before an unkempt, disheveled, hairy, sallow, pockmarked, greasy, infected. Dippy do dar person with a glass eye, and a pair of worm eating crackers loomed in front of him, blocking out the sun and boomed. Is this gonna be a song about cows? Why, yes, it is, indeed. Said the minstrel. I know a better one said the unkempt, disheveled, hairy, sallow, pockmarked, gritty, infected. Dippy, doodad person plucking out his glass eye and polishing it with a filthy rag. Then leaning his crutches against the tavern wall and slumping to the ground. And then, in a baritone, so gorgeous it was barely conceivable that its possessor was one so unkempt and disheveled and hairy and sallow and pockmarked and greasy and infected and Dippy Duda, the stranger sang the love song of our Fang Vanda, who can dope as he held the final note protracting the word loam to wrench from it more heartbreak than its present even in the closing scene of random harvest, Mervyn Leroy 1942. The minstrel burst into tears. He continued to weep, as he traveled far and wide, was weeping still, when eventually he passed it into the harbor at tan Tara beam aboard a packet steamer many many many moons later.

Now, it must be understood that they are a cold hearted lot the indigenous tan Tara bimmers they snarl and growl and grunt, but rarely sob, screaming screenings of random harvest that infamous for their mockery and chortling and fruit chucking yet now a miracle occurred. The minstrel returns to his homeland, perched on a harbourside crate, and selected Piccolo from its cotton PICHETTE and Tootle, the yearning melody of the love song of our Fang Vanda hougen dog. And then he began to sing the words. Frankly, his baritone was weedy and Reedy, in comparison to that of the unkempt, disheveled, hairy, sallow, pockmarked greasy, infected. Dippy, do dark person, but that mattered not a job here in faraway tan Tara been those loyal Bring up the Harbor was soon weeping and as he was cajoled to sing the song again and again. So tan Tara bimmers came scurrying from their hovels, and caves and country estates, thronging the harbor so densely that many were shoved into the sea. Those who could tread water, weeping still, others drowned, and on and on the minstrel sang until even the thickest and most stupid of kantara been fat heads could remember the words and all took up the song, and they sing, it's still morning, noon and night, weeping, weeping in that distant, possibly legendary land.

Yesterday in The Guardian, there was a little piece about the names of English rivers, I think, with some Scottish and Welsh ones as well, and it's very good. And I thought I'd just read you some of the river names that were there. The Buell the chess, the Pang, the knees, the T's, the D, the Cree, the NA, the TR, the verb, the box, the box, the x, the neath the fleet, the smite, the EBL, the piddle, the poly, the nadder, the wonderful, the feshie, the mashery, the wisi, the lug, the Udi, the maggot, the Tod the lard, the ERT the Wham Pol, the sniper resort, the scarf, the diver on the Cocker, the sting car.

Frank Key  17:26
Of course, there are many more rhythm names, so if you'd like to add your own, go to the hooting owl website, and about three posted Jews down from the top you should find the names of rivers, and you can add in the comments there. Go and visit the hooting yard website anyway. boffins recently conducted a study which showed that of all aquatic birds, the swan was the least responsive to reggae music, as so often happens in science, the findings were counterintuitive. We would expect swans to be more susceptible to reggae than say, Coots or herons. But it's difficult to argue with the boffins, but no fewer than a dozen site including ponds, reservoirs, lakes, riversides, and Mears. They set up scores of loudspeakers pounding out non stop reggae music, from dawn till dusk, and in some cases, from dusk till dawn to careful observation of the behavior of all forms of birdlife in the experimental zones, and analysis of electroencephalograms generated by sensors attached to the heads of selected birds. were combined with several other avian reggae methodologies, and the results were clear. While some Coots, herons, ducks read warblers and more hens showed a marked response to routes stylee rhythms, every single monitored Swan was utterly impervious, and went about his business by turns gliding with matchless elegance through the water, or savagely attacking things, as is the Swanee way. In one phase of the experiment, the nonstop pounding from scores of loudspeakers of classic tracks from Peter Tosh, Misty in roots, King Tubby and others, was accompanied by the display on hoardings, erected next to the experimental ponds, reservoirs, lakes, riversides, and Amir's have large portraits of Marcus Garvey, Haile Selassie and Jah Rastafari the latter to being more or less indistinguishable. Most of these pork crates were dogs in red and golden green and black irrespective of the range of the color spectrum visible to birds, which is a separate area of study, and one which neither I nor the boffins have pursued. herons proved to be the birds most drawn to jaw, in some cases, seemingly almost hypnotized by the combination of sound and image, though buffleheads scored highly here too. Once again, swans showed no response whatsoever to the visual stimulus, gliding past the hoardings with matchless elegance or savagely attacking unrelated things in the vicinity, as is the Swanee way. The study has sent shockwaves through both the reggae and the aquatic bird communities. One Upshot being a particularly the kooperative war of words erupting in the correspondence columns of the leading academic journal devoted to both fields. It was in a long article in aquatic birds and reggae weekly, that the boffins first announced their findings with lots of diagrams and even a photograph or two of a boffin attaching a brain center to the head of a reed warbler. Now, the letters pages have been expanded to fill over half of the magazine as rival boffins contend with each other. Perhaps the most constructive reaction has been from Professor Lars tauk of the School of Applied swans Studies at the University of kwazulu tssop in northwest Greenland. Working with a team of reggae experts and Swan lovers, he has posited the idea of creating reggae for swans, a specific sub genre of the music designed to somehow bash into their birdie brains, a deep and responsive enthusiasm for the music which they seem to shun. As part of the project, one group has been assembling as much documentation as possible on any pronouncement jar Rastafari had made, or is alleged to have made on the subject of swans. Certain wicked persons in Babylon have been putting it about that the

Frank Key  22:25
material thus far gathered is all forged, counterfeit or otherwise false. Wicked or not, this charge is convincing. In the case of a woolen knitted baggy beanie hat, onto which has been embroidered the phrase I and I heart swans, it is exceedingly unlikely that this hat actually belonged to DJI himself. Professor tauk has also suggested that the scores of loudspeakers pounding out non stop reggae music erected next to the ponds, reservoirs, lakes, riversides, and Mears in the experimental zone be made permanent. Indeed, he's gone as far as to say from his quiet retreat in the Arctic waste of Northwest Greenland, that wherever on Earth, swans are to be found, they should be subjected to constant reggae music blasting out of loudspeakers. This has not gone down well with Fuddy duddies who wish to preserve the peace and tranquility of many ponds, reservoirs like riversides, and Mears. Nor does the idea of find favor with wet blanket bird welfare types, who accused the professor of Swan cruelty. In response to the latter charge, he's issued a long winded and in places in comprehensible press release, in which he states boldly that his eventual aim is to create what he calls a modified swarm, genetically programmed not only to enjoy reggae music, but actually to require it in order to remain alive. No wonder talc has been compared to a Latter Day Frankenstein. There are no swans in Africa.

I found it hard to believe that there are no swans in Africa. But apparently that's the case. There's no such thing as an African swan. There you go. You learn something at hooting yard every week. Now and we're gonna end today program with a piece of music, but it occurs to me that we've got time before that for me to read a very short extract from that fantastic book further science book 20 by Norman Davis.
