Yeah, the art of listening Indeed, the way to do active listening is to, first of all, you got to siphon out your ears. And then keep them open. And this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And here is an exciting craft project for young and old alike. Follow the instructions carefully, and you'll be the proud and happy owner of a toy crow made out of balsa wood. Imagine the flabbergasted looks of family and friends as they admire your handiwork and resolve to pick on better more productive citizens by following your example. Imagine them gnashing their teeth in despair, as it becomes apparent that they are cack handed nincompoops, whereas you have the very opposite of a butter fingers. Incidentally, if you are by chance and butter fingers do not be deterred. All you need is self belief. Sometimes in the teeth of the evidence, just go and read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand and stops nibbling. First of all, obviously, you will need some balsa wood. I'm afraid that you will probably have to pay for it. If you are a mendicant and cannot countenance frittering your paltry beggins on something as essential as balsa wood, you may have to resort to theft, I cannot condone even the most measly Pirlo inment, of craft materials or indeed of anything else. So we would seem to have reached an impasse help maybe a hand however, from various charitable institutions, or even from wealthy individuals who share a passion for balsa wood work. You could try writing letters to such as Yoko Ono, or the Duke of Norfolk, or even Lynne cheney. The latter is the wife of the ex Vice President of the United States. Not to be confused with Lon Chaney, the deceased film actor. Here is a model letter you can use to ask for assistance. Dear insert name here. Right you I am an enthusiastic balsa wood crafts person. Unlike you, I am poverty stricken. Please send me some of your sex. Please send me some of your spare balsa wood so I can make a toy crow. You're sincerely insert your name here. That should do the trick and keep you away from a life of crime, the consequences of which can be disastrous only last week and ne'er do well was apprehended while trying to steal a tube of modeling paste from humans. And he is Drew to be hanged imminently. He will certainly not be the envy of his friends and the possessor of a crow made out of balsa wood, so do not even think about it and emulating him. So you now have your balsa wood. Next, you will need adhesive. There is a range of glues and gums available from Huberman and elsewhere. And I think I can leave it to you to make the right choice. It really doesn't matter whether the glue is clear or cloudy or white. Whether the method of delivery is via a nozzle or a squeezy pad or a spatula. Whether it comes in a tube or a tab or a jar. The only thing you need to keep an eye on is whether or not it is sticky enough to fit two pieces of balsa wood so decisively that they cannot be prized apart even by wild beast. You may want to test the adhesiveness of your chosen adhesives before cementing the purchase. If you are in Huberman, you can go to the little cupboard near the fire escape to do so. And I'm sure other retailers have similar facilities. Although they may there may be a fee involved. I will assume that you have returned home safely with a suitable adhesive and that your pile of bought or donated balsa wood awaits you on your kitchen table. If you do not have a kitchen table. For example, if your kit trendy, pokey and does not accommodate much more than a bread bill and a kettle. any old table will do. If you do not have a table of any sort, just use the floor, but sweep it clean of filth, please.

Now, the next step is to sort out your balsa wood, working methodically and with rigorous self control, divvy the balsa wood into discrete piles, putting like with like, so for example, place together pieces that might serve as beat those suitable for wings or talents and so forth. By the end of the exercise, you should have separate piles of balsa wood for each part of a Crow's anatomy. If you lack ornithological confidence, and are not entirely sure what a crow looks like, don't be afraid to consult a reference book, preferably one with lots of pictures. Just make sure that the book you choose has a section on birds. There are a few paperbacks in the basement of Huberman. But for a broader selection, you may want to look further afield. Now is the time to make use of that adhesive. Remove the lid or wrench off the cap or pierce the sale of the cube or jar or tab. Sometimes this is easier said than done, and you may need to be violent. If you are a weakling. some preliminary strengthening exercises are recommended. Or as a shortcut, you can try drinking various invigorating syrups those of you who choose the latter might want to seek advice from a qualified medical practitioner and I stress the word qualified. quacks shaman mountebank and wizards cannot be trusted as far as you could throw them, if you will not a weakling, no matter how exciting their various potions may seem. Be diligent and examining the certificates and diplomas if you're chosen medico. And remember that things are not always as they seem. And there is a roaring trade in counterfeit documents. If you have even the tiniest suspicion that there is an attempt to hoodwink you with a forgery, call the police immediately. Okay, you're ready to build that crow. Keeping an eye on a reference book picture if necessary, assemble the crow by gumming together bits of balsa wood taken from the separate piles. I don't need to go through this in in ordinate detail because you're not stupid, but to get you started, and to make sure you don't make a ridiculous mess of the whole thing. Just remember to stick together the bits of the crow that are contiguous. For example, the beak goes on the head, the talents are at the far end of the legs, from the body and so on. You may find that there is an anatomical crow part for which you do not have a corresponding part of suitably shaped balsa wood pieces. If so, throw caution to the winds and improvise. strike an attitude of vivacity and daring and all else will follow. Trust me. When you're done, and you're and you compare your balsa wood crow with the picture you have probably been working from you will notice that something is not quite right. Do not be downcast. I'm not yet done. This point, you need to go back to hoomans find the paint department and get some black paint and a paintbrush. Men Dickens should have already fired off letters to paint keen wealthy people such as Arianna Huffington or Art Garfunkel. Now, before slapping the paint onto your CRO, make sure that each piece of balsa wood is thoroughly stuck to the piece next to it. As you bash it and rent it and throw it around the room, it is possible that a part may break off. If this happens, splurge more glue on and reattach whatever part it is the beak or a feather with a bit more vim when you're sure that your crow will not fall apart. paint it black all over two or three times. Replace the lid on your tin of paint and wash your paintbrush very thoroughly under the hot water tap or with a slosh of terps depending on the type of paint you used, and that's it. When the paint is dry, you can pick up your balsa wood Crow and take it round to show off to your family and friends who will be flabbergasted just As I promised, note for men Dickens. If you made your crow

using donated balsa wood and paint, it's a good idea it is good manners to write a letter to your benefactor and closing a snap of the wooden bird. I know I gave you a model letter to copy before, but this time I'm going to leave you to your own devices. For by now you will I hope you have the confidence to stand on your own two feet and need no further mollycoddling.

A curious title Excuse me. A curious tale attaches itself to the shortest pamphlet Dobson ever published. of a light hearted even frisky disposition one foul winter's day. He wrote as follows.

Frank Key  11:24
Obtain a large jug of paraffin. Remove the cap from the jug and slosh the paraffin over a pile of something dry and Bristol in a public place. Toss a lighted match on to it, stand back and watch the resulting Blaze. This will warm your cockles and provide a pleasing spectacle to pass the time of day. Having nothing further to add, the pamphleteer persuaded marigold to to set these four sentences in a particularly decisive and heroic typeface and, and issued it under the unambiguous title found with parafin exclamation mark. For the cover marigold crew chose a mezzotint by the mezzotint test Rex tint, depicting his sister dot tint hand tinting one of his mezzotint with a paraffin based colorant. Before doing any typesetting or production work on the pamphlet, however, marigold two had a fractious to do with Dobson over his use of the word jog. She insisted that a drug was by definition, an open neck container, and that he should prefer the word canister for a canister would have a cap and be more likely receptacle for paraffin than would a drug which, though it may be fixed, fitted with a plug or stopper would never have a cap. Dobson never took kindly to having his errors pointed out to him, believing the sheer force of his prose, even in so short a pamphlet is this ought to silence his critics. He was fond of quoting Christopher smartline, from guba latte agno, where the poet says, For I pray God for the ostriches of souls very plain, the beavers of the Medway and silverfish of 10s. Sorry, that's the wrong line. I was distracted there for a moment by a freshly laundered ditch cloth flapping in the breeze. The lawn Dobson like to use to defend himself against detractors from Christopher smart group a lot I agno. was not that one. It was this one. For my talent is to give an impression upon words by punching, that when the reader cast his eye upon them, he takes up the image from the mold, which I have made. marigold to though, was a stickler and calendar Dobson to produce in the real world rather than from the skewed universe inside his skull, a drug sealed with a cap. characteristically, the pamphleteer tried to shirk this by muttering some nonsense about his urgent need to examine a nest of stints in a shrubbery as above a pond. Why on earth he persisted in his lifelong delusion that ornithology could rescue him from any pickle he found himself in is a question for wiser heads than mine. marigold crew made short shrift of this of his dinty babblings of course, and Dobson was left with no choice but to head off to humans in the hope that somewhere on the shelves of that unutterably gorgeous department store, he might pounce upon a kept drug. And therein lies the strangeness of this tale. For As he approached the plaza where who Berman's loomed enormous, he found the building in shrouded in a weird mode mist, like the purple cloud in MP shields novel, The purple cloud, and he wandered into the mist and through the doors of humans. And there in the foyer, he came upon a tottering tower of drugs, all with screw top caps, and all filled to the brim with parafin and he was convulsed by a desire to toss a lighted match upon them, and to pass on entertaining time watching the Blaze, just as he had described and he's yet to be typeset pamphlet.

But as he reached into his pocket for a box of lucifers, he was felled by an eagle eyed Huberman security guard. Titanic monster of a man whose epaulette christened in the mist, and whose buttons gris and in the midst even more than his epaulettes, so glisten, and Dobson was kept under lock and key in a broom cupboard in the basement of the department store until bailed by an eerie, cadaverous magistrate, who rode the land on horseback following the most missed wherever it's settled, home again frazzled and with mysterious most drainage upon his clothing. The pamphleteer told his tale, the marigold crew, who, despite raising a skeptical eyebrow, skipped at once to her shed, and cranked out Dobson's pamphlet with the text as Dobson wanted it, the world once again cast for the mold whose words made

I woke one morning from uneasy dreams to find a foreign person standing at the foot of my bed shouting at me. This was the beginning of a series of events, so disturbing, sell uncanny, that I'm reluctant to tell you about them for fear that I will not be believed. But I am in a quandary. For if I do not unburden myself of this tail, I will surely go completely crackers, such as the fight for told by the foreign person. It was among the things he was shouting at me. As I woke. I did not understand him at the time, for his tongue was alien to me. And in any case, his shouting was so deafening that I could not make out individual words, but later, I had everything translated, read aloud by a trained actor, and recorded on a cylinder. maddeningly, however, it was clear from listening to the cylinder that the shouting foreign person had forbidden me ever to speak of the things that happened for not only would I go crackers, but I would suffer from au and the dropsy, and the bindings, and my legs and arms would be broken, and my belly would be a thing crawling with worms, and I would shrivel up and die. What a dilemma I was in to be sure. I said that the shouting foreign person was standing when I woke the foot of my bed. In truth, it was not really a bed, but a wooden pallet, laid any old house on the floor, onto which I had dragged a mattress or what past for a mattress under the present regime. So the foreign person was not just standing there, which would have been alarming enough. But towering above me. It was a foreign person of no mean stature who shouted at me and his weird guttural language. I would say he was seven feet tall at a guess. And if that sounds implausible, broaden your mind. This globe is dotted with extremely tall persons hither and yon All I'm saying is that one such person was standing at the foot of my palate shouting at me. I think if I had still had a bed to sleep in, I would have been better able to cope with the situation. The shouting foreign person would not have loomed so Titanic had I been raised up from the floor, the angle from my head to his less the angle from my head to his less acute. Also, I would have had blankets to pull up to my kin in a protective gesture, rather than having no blankets. The regime is dedicated to the reinvigoration of its citizenry. And that is why we begin to sleep on pallets without covers, and with any windows that have not been bricked up flung open as wide as they can be flung. such measures are as of today still optional, though rumors fly as rumors will, that the era of coercion will soon be upon us. I am doing my best to help usher in the bright new civilization promised by the regime. And I can say with pride that I was the first person in my cadet tower to smash up my bed with a fire axe and nail a broken clutter of wood into the three pallets donating the spare pair to the Rex Harrison tower for the destitute, to which I had already given two thirds of the stuffing from my mattress that we still have need of a tower for the destitute, has been described as a blot upon the regime. But I challenge anyone to show me a regime without a blot. It can't be dumb. The shouting foreign person was also a sort of blot in that his appearance was anomalous and untidy and a sort of rupture in the natural order. He ought not to have been there, but an ignore ugly like a blot he was, I'm afraid all I could do at the time was shriek this did not stop him shouting, and boy, oh boy, did he shout. It was so loud, he would have raised the roof if I'd had a roof rather than the frayed tarpaulins stretched over my room at the top of the tower. The actor I engaged to record the translated shouting onto a cylinder did not shout. But he declined the words in a thespian boom that

Frank Key  22:39
was quite loud enough. I had come upon this actor when I went to see a regime recommended production of Jasper pock save and that is amusing electrical wiring systems of play of great potted resonance. I'm not much of a theater goer. And I doubt I would recognize potted resonance is great or small, without a prompt. But I swooned with pleasure whenever this particular actor opened his mouth. So he was the natural choice when I needed someone to record the translation of the foreign persons shouting. hiring him was easy enough, as he was a part time cadet, and live below me far, far below me in the cadet tower. more troublesome before that was finding a translator. Bear in mind that I had no idea from whence this foreign person had hovde nor to what barbaric language he did his shouting. It was with some reluctance that I asked around in case anyone else had been woken by the blot, for I did not want to gain a reputation as a cadet in Thrall to anomalous phenomena. Lord knows we have enough of such creatures more and more of whom have been crawling out of the broken brickwork since the regime adopted its current very wise policy of isolating them in a tower of their own near the frontier. Soon, which will have no more of these tiresome cadets in my own tower, and that will be a small but significant step towards the bright new civilization we are promised by the regime under the guiding hand of the great Helms woman. I never did find anyone who admitted to having been woken up by shouting foreign person at the foot of their palate, and happened upon my translator through pure chance. I was paddling in an approved paddling pool and struck up a conversation with my one fellow Pagla. In the course of our conversation, she told me she was a translator who specialized in barbaric and guttural languages. I hired her on the spot without telling her what it was. I wanted her to do. translate, and as we eat towel last feet dry while sitting on the cement blocks surrounding the paddling pool, I swore to secrecy. First, she balked at this, for she suspected moral turpitude as well, she might. But she was reassured when I flipped my cadet coupon out of my pocket. She did the translation that very day, and the next day, I ran to ground the actor with the booming voice and had him record the cylinder. That's it was that I learned that I would go crackers if I did not tell anyone about the shouting foreign person at the foot of my palate, and all the subsequent oddities that befell me and crackers, accompanied by other fears and maladies if I did, that was and remains my quandary. I am of course making the assumption that the bossy foreign person shouted the truth. It has never for one moment crossed my mind.

Frank Key  26:08
Excuse me. It has never for one moment crossed my mind that he's shouting may have been twaddle either purposefully or so otherwise, nor have I entertained the possibility that my paddling pool translators grasp of his barbaric tongue may have been less than expert. I have implicitly trusted both parties. Perhaps that makes me a fool, but the crunch is that there is no one I can ask to judge due to the nature of my dilemma. I can see where all this is leading. You know, I know that the regime will succeed must succeed in reinvigorating the citizenry and realizing the accomplishment of our bright new civilization. But now I am as sure as a cadet can be that by the time that golden era dawns, I shall have been turfed out of my tower and ice will be languishing either out at the frontier in the tower for cadets in Thrall to anomalous phenomena. Or worse, just down the road in the Rex Harrison tower for the destitute. Whichever comes to pass, I shall no longer be the perky cadet, I am not now, I will be a blocked.

Frank Key  27:54
That's the end of this week's show. But I just like to point out that if you'd like comprehensive architectural blueprints of the Rex Harrison tower for the destitute, so you can make your own model of one, possibly out of balsa wood, and glue and black paint, just like a crow. And then write to me at hooting dots yard at dream gmail.com. And I might say something back, which will either be promised to send the blueprints or something else entirely. I'm not really sure what I'm saying here. It might be I'm the slide School of our afternoon thing will be over by six o'clock next Thursday, I'm told, but I may not be here as I may be at hospital at the hospital, having a needle injected directly into my eyeball. Again. Our current I have lost count of the number of times this has happened. And I have to say it doesn't seem to be doing my eyes much good. So never mind is something somebody tell the grandchildren when I have some. That's it for this week. I'll be back either next week or the week after. I hope you've enjoyed the show. And thanks very much, very many thanks to john for Johnny seven for producing it as ever. And that's that's it. I can't think of anything else to say today. Other than Java who Sita the space greeting bye bye
