Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting out on the air. We had an extended theme tune there because of exciting technical problems in the studio. It occurred to me to write something on the bus on the way to the studio to give this week's show a really contemporary feel. I know that hooting yard listeners rightly expect a program that has its finger on the pulse of the times. That's truly up to the minute. Well, this week, it really is because what I'm reading to you was written within the last hour. And I'm reading it with some difficulty actually, because a bus journey does not lend itself to the practice of exquisite copperplate handwriting on trying to make sense of what can only be described as a semi legible school, buses bump and clatter and shake, and at times it's akin to being a sock or napkin in a tumble dry. Cold This is doll let me turn to another non bus related topic. Recently, I referred in passing on a show a couple of weeks ago to my Flemish treats cloth suit, and as a result, I received letters from several listeners who, showing great good sense sought my advice on matters of style and fashion of dash and Erlang. strikingly no fewer than four of these letters concerned the wearing of hats as a rakish angle. Dear Frank wrote one listener somewhat familiarly given that I have no idea who he is. Can you tell me how best to calculate the exact angle at which I should wear my hat or tip for to maximize it right. Rakesh sness. Well, for that correspondent and for the others who raised this important matter, I'm preparing a small pamphlet not yet in print, which addresses the question with more vigor and panache than I would get has ever been attempted since people began wearing hats, caps, bonnet, tammo, chanteuse phases, and all sorts of other headgear, which, as you're probably aware, was an immensely long time ago, back in what we often call the mists of time, and certainly before you were born. By my reckoning, it took several centuries from the first wearing of a hat to the excuse me. I've got a bit of a cold, so I'm going to start that sentence again, rather than have a coughing fit. By my reckoning, it took several centuries from the first wearing of a hat to the insight that to tilt the said hat at a rakish angle, lent the wearer a certain cachet among the other members of their tribe, or what following Hazel Blears, we would call now call wear community. And of course, there were many false starts. Some angles are simply not rakish, and never will be. But they were tried and tested, often with the use of protractors and sextants and Astro lathes. And we should be grateful to those tireless yet flawed hat angle experimenters. For without their work, we would doubtless still be going about our modern gleaming streets, wearing our hats at ludicrously on rakish angles. Some people still do, of course, including one or two of my fellow passengers on this bus. I think it my duty, once my pamphlet is in print, to carry a carton of them with me wherever I roam, handing out free copies to the needy, and the bus journey now. I shall lay down my pen and speak to you soon.

Yes, you must forgive me if I my voice. Sounds a bit wracked with ruin. But I will try to get through this without stopping. And I've been thinking a lot recently about hustings. Well, when I say recently, I mean this afternoon. And when I say hustings, I mean more particularly Dobson's hoisting and Blodgett Hastings. The pamphleteer as is well known, was once voiced by his own petard, an incident which is the subject of an illuminating essay by Allah wishes nesting bird. Blodgett, on the other hand, was repeatedly voiced by a variety of petard none of which he could call his own. This says much I think about the difference between Dobson and Blodgett, not just in terms of hoisting and petard, but in all sorts of other ways. If only I could be as illuminating as nesting bird. But alas, you'll have to be content with something which if it can be said to illumine at all, is the prose equivalent of a sputtering Takeda lamp hanging on our hook in an immensity of darkness compared to the incandescence, which nesting bird sheds whenever he puts pen to paper?

Frank Key  06:19
Indeed, I'm so cowed by the sheer damned splendor of nesting birds Si, that I've considered abandoning this puny attempt to address those voicings myself and abandon it I would as decisively as a decisive sea captain Maroons a mutineer on an arid sea girt rock. We're not that nesting bird concerns himself solely with Dobson's twisting by his own petard, and has not a word to say about Blodgett. So it may be that in spite of the weakness of my own scribblings they can yet fill a gap in the record or to be more precise gaps. For as I've said, in Blodgett case, we're dealing with repeated and innumerable Hastings. The puzzle, of course, is that each and every one of these voicings was upon someone or something else's petard. And the question that Christ a heaven for an answer is, how did Blodgett managed to get himself into so many scrapes and each scrape so similar? One would have thought that after being hoisted upon the petard of an Undertaker's mute at an impressionable age, he might have learned something the very least he might have learned to avoid Undertaker's mutes with petard but it was not so. Barely a fortnight after that first hoisting. We find the young Blodgett once again hanging around in the vicinity of a funeral parlor, idli tugging at his incipient goatee, and dressed flamboyantly and Cerise and dandelion yellow. He is lurking in as much one in as much as one can lurk in Cerise and dandy line yellow in a fetid alleyway at the back of the funeral parlor, a parlor owned by an old family firm of funeral directors founded by fairing, fafo FOF, in the 1850s. And it was upon the petard of a faithful father. And it was upon the petard of a facile, fluffy and mute. That Blodgett was hoist at two o'clock on that September afternoon, and afternoon of schools and drizzle and abnormal bird phenomena. Not until 315. Did he managed a clamber from the petard and descend to the pavement, a picture of befuddlement and the laughingstock of a gang of facile FOF employees mute and otherwise, who had gathered to witness his hoisting over the next several years Blodgett was to be hoist on the petard of Dutchman tugboat captains Spinetta mezzotint his old cloth of gold dust up pan pop men, squirrel Stranglers shove hypotony maestro's indentured and greeted peasants, shifty knaves, chunky puckers Marina Warner readers, fudges, beam poles, harem scarem Tidewater mappers dish cloth makers, farmyard freaks and sundry other petard this time and again, the hapless Blodgett made the same mistakes fell into the same traps blundered into the same in blunder moments. The only person who seemed to see anything odd about this was Blodgett mother, a ghostly white speck of a woman, who by turned remonstrated with him sobbed, laughed, hid away from him and crannies project his head with surgical implements, sent him into the mountains and tried to marry him off to a foreign country. Tessa Blodgett himself just continued with his hoisting on an almost daily basis. Things leveled off eventually with no more than one or two hoisting the year, particularly after his mother's death. Blodgett did not attend her funeral, which was organized by the faithful Fox with many ribbons and a horse, but without an Undertaker's mute. Tim, the mute of the day was due to leader procession through the hopeless rain soaked streets of Blodgett mother's horrible hometown, but an hour before the coffin was shoved onto the funeral cart, he was hoist not by his own petard, but by Blodgett, as far as we know, this is the only evidence we have that Blodgett had a petard of his own, and it remains an inexplicable mystery why he was never wished upon it himself, such as a perplexities of the human comedy.

JOHN Paul Sartre is trilogy The road to freedom has fallen out of fashion somewhat as if that mattered, yet it remains a classic. But for a book with a bit more existentialist heft. I recommend pebble heads best selling paperback, the roads to J wick. That blighted benighted. dilapidated seaside town has of course provided fodder for any number of pop boilers, including traywick, West of Clacton, and the sordid sands of squalor. But pebble heads is a fundamentally serious work, and there's a lot about cows in it, which is always a good thing. In an interview with the literary Dunder pate, the author explained the genesis of his novel. One morning as I was eating marmalade straight from the jar with a spoon, he said, it occurred to me in a flash of insight that if one is so minded, all roads lead eventually to Jay wick. Once you approach the shabby resort itself, there is but the one road pitted and on lovely and dismal. But to reach that road, one must travel along many other roads, depending on where you start from. You might be in gore pit, or fingering hoe or van or even messing or fobbing or Dendi. It doesn't much matter, for there will be a road wherever you are, that will lead you inexhaustibly to the wind swept collapsing hovels of j week. Lord knows even from man beg and clynder if you have j wick in your soul, you will find a road to take you there. That last phrase is quite telling. pebble had originally planned to call his Titanic masterpiece, a J, wick of the soul, but decided against it. It's true enough, he explained that there is a sort of psycho j wick that lurks within the mind of every man and woman on the planet. But I wanted to insist upon the real physical j wick, that place where the second traveler can come to a halt and go for a pint and then never say die and get their head kicked in by Pharrell j wick used. pebble head goes on to describe the transfixing sense of vetch Mets. He felt when peering over the sea wall and seeing on the gruesome beach, a big sign warning him of danger, keep off. As a best selling paperback guest, pebble head has sometimes been criticized for being shackled to realism. And in the process of writing the road to Jay wick. He did indeed test out his thesis by traveling by road to those glum coastal shacks from a variety of starting points. He proved that roads from three King Omen scratby and snodland from coffin swell and mugdock and krung Dale, from who and Willington and cat brain and Widdop and slack and splat from each of these in a cart Pong by inelegant horses, he could eventually reach j week, and that he suggest is what makes us human arguing his case with a vivid account. Taking up more than two thirds of the book of the famous incident known in Jay wick law as the day the cows came visiting. The cows Of course, came not by road but being cows across fields across flat, hopeless fields on a misty morning. It is a haunting tale and one to which pebble heads gorgeous pros does justice. I believe it's a great scandal that the roads to dry wick is not a set text to be read by tinies in all the community education hubs in the land. It's all very well filling their heads with the likes of Saturn de Beauvoir and Norman spin read, but those who devise the curriculum will reap a whirlwind. Better by far surely to envision a nation in which our urchins sit in raptured in their study pods, lapping up the timeless words of pebble head, pebble head who, for the sake of literature, lay drunkenly sprawled in the gutter outside the never say die in a wretched seaside hellhole in the spooky mist at risk of being trampled by roaming cows whose roaming brought them as if by some uncanny cow controlling propulsive force across the field to Jay wick, west of Clacton.

Apologies I suppose to anyone, any listeners who actually live in dry wick. I do recommend a visit and the incident with the day the cows came visiting happened a couple of years ago. And there's a fantastic j WIC related website where you can look at all the pictures of the cows roaming into j WIC across the misty fields. If you put j WIC and the day the cows came visiting into Google, you'll find it or you can follow a link to it from that piece on the hooting yard website. I'm sure you know where to find that. For a long time for years and years and years, I've been meaning to write about Dobson's dingey It's a subject which I'm convinced will be hypnotically fascinating to my listeners. And yet whenever I settled to the task as I did yesterday morning, with the nib of my pen polished to a gleam and a fresh stack of blank rectangular paper. I found myself once again baffled and plaintive. It's not that the contents of my skull seized up like a polar shipping packet. For I have done my usual crack of dawn brain exercises, flexing the synapses using a set of techniques culled from a Victorian everyday book. Some might say that synapses are not things you can flex, and they may be correct, but I'm sure you understand what I'm driving at. The point is that I was in tip top writing condition hunched over my desk, nib gleaming and paper stacked and blank. And outside my window. Crows was stalking across the grass, fat and black and Ted Hughes, he and the sight of crows seldom fails to inspire me, no matter what I'm writing about. Sometimes I feel pages and pages blathering or about crows, and then cleverly crossed out every mention of the bird and substituted it with another noun. For example, windscreen wiper or bazooka, or even with a dozen different nouns whimsically in a great creative outpouring, the likes of which would put Dobson himself to shame, where he's still with us. I've tried this technique over the years when trying to write about Dobsons dingey as a weapon against my bafflement, but it never quite works. And those pages are turned into scrap or made into paper airplanes or paper, hovercraft or paper Hindenburg airships, depending on my mood of the moment. It can be very relaxing to fold one's abandoned manuscript into toy forms of transport. Once I was so thoroughly relaxed after folding half a hopeless novella into a paper fleet of milk floats that I fell into a coma. other writers find different uses for their discarded scribblings, the poet Dennis beer pint I learned tears is dejected. into thousands of pieces with untold savagery, cursing and fuming as he does so, while pebble heads the best selling paperback is binds all his up into a bundle with butchers string and carries it down to the beach and throws it into the sea. Frankly, I'm surprised that a writer is successful and prolific as pebble head ever has aborted works to decide to so dispose of. But I'm told that he's seen upon the sands at least once a week casting his bundles upon the briny Dobson never launched his dingey into the sea. On the very rare occasions when the fancy took him, he would push it into a pond and clamber in and paddle it across alarming and he ducks such as teal and coot who got in his way. The dingey was yellow and made of rubber and Dobson bought it at a closing down sale from a Reuben ship Chandlers there, there is the essence of my bafflement and my pointedness I have just told you everything I know about Dobson's dingey every time I have a mind to write about it, I reached the same impasse. I have exhausted the topic and have nothing else to say. Give me a week or a month, and no doubt I'll wake up one morning and feel impelled yet again, to try to write dozens of pages of vigorous and impassioned prose about Dobson's dingey. I'll mention the pond, the yellow color, the rubber fabric, and the routine trips Charla and that will be that

I was going to follow that with a piece called advice upon vinegar. But looking at the time left on the show, and think that's probably too short. So instead, I'm going to read you something slightly longer, which should take about 10 minutes until the end of the show. This is an old piece, which you may have heard before, but the exciting thing about it is it's from the brand new hooting yard paperback which is not yet out but it should be out within the next couple of weeks, two or three weeks, certainly within the month 336 pages 101 stories and that will be available from from the website. I'm not going to tell you the title because it will ruin their surprise. Anyway, this is called shriveled when I removed the shrivel human head from the burlap sack, my first thought was that there must have been foul play as detectives like to call it but I'm not a detective and foul play seemed incongruous in this sun dappled Meadow splattered with buttercups, Tansy and wild hollyhocks under a gorgeous blue sky. Just before stumbling upon the sack. I'd been singing at the top of my voice, singing a happy song, one of my own devising a plan of praise to bees, extolling the virtues of those splendid buzzy insects. And I was dressed like a bee sort of in a black and yellow hoop jumper and black leggings and a black cap upon my head. There was no capital hat of any sort on the shriveled head I took from the sack, just a few strands of filthy matted hair. I sat on the grass and took a pair of snippy butchers scissors out of my pocket and gave the shriveled head a much needed haircut. And I made a little pile of the clippings on a patch of bare soil and set fire to it with a match and it blazed oh so briefly sparking and crackling and and then all that was left was a trace of ash. I plopped the shriveled head back into the burlap sack, swung it over my shoulder, and headed off towards old farmer fracks pig farm, singing lustily. No one knew how old farmer frack was, and no one could remember a time when he was not squelching about in the mouth at all hours of the day or night raising his pigs. As farms go It was a tiny farm. But old farmer frack was a giant of a man by the standards of that land and his pigs grew to giants to under his care. It was a mystery how he made his living, for he never took his pigs to market to sell them. When they reached a size that made them too big for the tiny farm, he drove them up into the hills and let them loose. That is why dutiful parents warn their children against going on wandering alone in the hills and tell terrifying tales of giant rampaging pigs which capture and carry off misbehaved infants in their big trumping drawers. I found old farmer fracking Gulf in a fog of culinary fumes in his kitchen. He was preparing his lunch, a concoction of drugged hair, deviled kidneys and blow Monge. And he was cursing like a sailor for he had inadvertently drugged the kidneys and deviled the hair. One of his pigs, not yet Titanic in stature was rooting around the skirting boards, looking perhaps for beetles or as I creeping things. I patted the pig on it Shanks if pigs have shanked and placed my sack on the table. This might interest you old farmer frac, I said, helping myself to a tumblers worth of water from the spigot except phase maritime curses learned when he was but a boy. old farmer frack was a man of few words. He eyed the sack and he eyed me and he eyed his spigot. Then he put down his jug full of kidneys, and opened the sack with unnecessary vigor, causing the shriveled human head to roll across the table and toppled to the floor. To its credit, the pig ignored it. old farmer frac, stared at the shriveled head and immediately made the sign of the cross. I had no idea he was a typist. pig farmer. I just snipped the gory locks off this gory find, I said, and then I burned them.

Frank Key  27:03
I stooped to lift the head back onto the table, but I'll find my frack clouded me with main force and I crumpled to the floor. unconscious for a few seconds. I came to with the pig snout in my face, the shriveled human head was perilously close to one of the pigs cloven feet, and I feared that it would be crushed should the pig become excitable and begin stamping. Thinking Fast I reached my hand up and patted the pig soothingly. Previously when I had patted it Shanks or what I believed to be it Shanks, I had done so in a perfunctory manner such as one might Chuck a dog under the chin. Now I will the applicator he forces of blockman movement number seven a into my hand that I might communicate what botsman termed absolute pig calm. At this point, old farmer frac smashed me on the head with a spade typical of a farmer I thought to keep us bathed in his kitchen, and then I passed out for hours. I was woken by the unbearable sound of a transistor radio blaring into my ears unbearable, because on radio pipsqueak, it was apparently you two day and the noise assailing me was the voice of the preposterous Paul nabo Heusen a krisztian Irish millionaire given to taking expensive court action to retrieve a pair of trousers and a hat. I launched to deaden the sound in any way I could. And so I'll farm a frack looming above me. His gels smeared with vestiges of deviled hair, junk kidneys, and Bluemont. You brought me the wrong head. He said, The goop riously.

Frank Key  29:21
So that's the end of hooting yard for this week. I'll read you advice regarding vinegar next week, along with all sorts of other stuff I expect. And I'd like to suppose the book will be out by next week, but it certainly will be nearer completion than it is today. So look out for that. Yeah, I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
