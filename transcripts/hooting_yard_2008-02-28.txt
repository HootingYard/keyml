Previously on hooting yard. Oh, I so wanted this to be a seafaring yarn. I wanted to hear the wind in the rigging smell assault tank in the breeze roll with the creek and lurch of old wooden boards on the deck. The narrator of this story by aerostat to hooting yard is sent on a mission by Dobson to track down burble and beat him to death with a club. Tracking verbal through where he's been over the last year. The narrator stowed away on a ship hoping to track him down. But the ship then explodes he walks away unharmed, and meets one of Dobson's other agents who tells him that in fact, burble is in hooting yard, which is just a little bit away by bus, but there are no buses.

Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key. As you know from that little trailer we're halfway through or slightly more than halfway through the story by aerostat to hooting yard, and so it continues. I eventually traveled to hooting yard by hot air balloon or aerostat I met the pilot if that is the word in the tavern. Her name was motza blonk fist and she agreed to carry me and my have a sack purely as ballast. In other words, we would be held over the side should occasion arise. This was of no concern to me as I had a parachute in my have a sack Ha. mops was bound for the outskirts of Hoon, carrying a strangely assorted cargo, including a barometer and compass, flags, anchors, cork jackets, a packet of pamphlets, a bottle of brandy, some biscuits, apples to useless silk covered aerial or an equally useless rudder, and mouline a, a sort of hand operated revolving fan. We got up safely, and I settled back to read some of the pamphlets. I was startled to discover that Dobson had written one of them. It was a little cracked, entitled 92 uses and abuses of mustard. I barely got beyond the first few sentences, the prose was terse but doltish. peering over the rim of the basket, I saw the sort of scene one sees from the basket of a balloon. We had been in the air for perhaps a quarter of an hour when we were buffeted by an earthly flock of spiny winged things. I'm afraid that I screeched with fried mops or blonk fist showed rather more presence of mind lashing at the malevolent beasts with a gleaming Cutlass, but it was too late. The airbag had already been punctured. And we began immediately to lose altitude. mocks are carried out a number of exciting technical adjustments involving the Gauls valves and flaps of the aerostat Meanwhile, I searched desperately in my have a sack for the parachute of descent quickened. replanting towards the ground very fast shouted matzah. Hold on to your hat. I'm not wearing a hat, I replied, quaking with terror. Here she cried, tossing me a worm Ethan Beretta. I whacked it onto my skull in the nick of time, we crashed to Earth with much bumping thumping and a series of splats. Miraculously, I was unharmed. moxa herself suffered only a lesion on her brow. Although the spokes on her wheelchair were terribly mangled. we dragged ourselves clear of the silken wicker wreckage, and fetched up in a ditch moxa had managed to salvage the biscuits and the useless rather, I expelled a mouthful of mud and reached into my have a sack for various bits and pieces of navigational equipment, including an extensively detailed map. Look, mops are gasped actually dallied with a biscuit. There are the gates of hooting yard was an old slow culture I was so busy rooting around in my hammer sack that I did not use my eyes moxa was right. I followed her pointing finger and saw a tremendous British portal ornamented with lozenge carvings of quicklime, bilberry and glandt. I had reached my destination somewhere behind those gates looked verbal and I was coming for him. mops his wheelchair was soon knocked back into shape, and she rattled off towards the outskirts of Hoon, before she left and despite my protestations, she insisted that I take half of the biscuits. As soon as her back was turned, I ground them into the muck beneath my boot. I could not bear the distractions of shortbread, my mat bags of mush would suffice.

I traced burble easily and carried out Dobson's instructions without a hitch. The flooded mineshaft was on a patch of waste ground four or five miles from hooting yard, somewhat gratuitously. I wipe the blood off my hands with burbles own cravat. It had been embroidered by hand, his sweethearts, perhaps, depicting in intricate detail a selection of uproarious scenes from the Old Testament. For a moment, I considered keeping it as a souvenir. What a thought. I tossed it down the mineshaft at the bottom of which lay the fresh corpse of burble. Taking a blowtorch out of my head a sack, I incinerated the wheelbarrow in which I had crumbled his body to this detestable spot. When all that remained was a pile of ashes. I turned away and began the long clawed back to hooting yard. The night air wreaked of Stalinism, I pulled my cardigan tighter around my body and lit up on a Perkins two routes. As I plotted, I rehearsed in my head the opening lines of the report I would write for Dobson your instructions arrived at midnight. I was dog tired having spent the evening slaughtering a colony of flies. Nevertheless, I took immediate steps. My first thought was to select the weapon. You specified a club, and I hoped I would not be straying too far from your intentions by using a lead mag. I went up to the attic to fetch it. There was no battery in my torch and I clambered such drivel would Dobson be interested in all the detail, but he had asked for a full report and he was going to get one. And I clambered over the huge iron crates which were stacked in my loft, I could hardly see a thing. Eventually, I identified the correct crate and blasted it open. Inside underneath a pile of anti matter. I found the mag, it had last been used. Pound some Morag words into oblivion, and minute traces of the plant were embedded on the head. The match would need a thorough cleaning. descending from the attic, I filled the bath Donda rather fetching kit of protective clothing and hold a glorious array of chemical preparations into the piping hot water. I then plunged the mag into the bath. These not unpleasant though actually holy fictional recollections were interrupted. before I was even halfway back to hooting yard. A finger loomed before me in the darkness. As I closed upon it, I saw that it was crown lop why crown lop I cried. You have the appearance of a maniac. You are disheveled and frosty and pale. Your teeth are clenched, and although the light is not good, I can see that your features are distorted by an awful Rictus. You are brandishing a duck. krumlov might no reply, but lunged towards me aiming the duck at my throat. If I were to avoid a grizzly death, I would have to act fast. I step to one side swiveled duct and shimmied in an alarming fashion designed to bewilder my assailant. At the same time I eased to have a sack from my shoulders lifted above my head and brought it crashing down on Chrome locks scowl. He crumpled to the ground, removing Dobson's medical dictionary from my hammer sack, I satisfied myself that crumb lock was dead. I then made a thorough search of his countless pockets. It was almost dawn before I finished emptying them, spreading their contents out on the ground around his body. Among the aniseed balls, bleach corks, diuretics, a got floor cloth gobstoppers hurricane lamps, ink jam, kale, landing nets, Morris tubes, nard, OT polio vaccines, Quicksilver rep shares, foals, ukulele, strings, vowels, wadding xanthine yogurt and Zoo water me diagrams. I found what I was looking for. I knew that crumble was too stupid to destroy his instructions from Dobson as I always did, and they're in the midst of the rubbish was a small piece of paper tool number two carefully from a notebook on which Dobson had scrolled his orders. I spat into the Bracken and read them. track down scrim jaw. After he has killed burble waylay him and slit his throat with a dog, then bury him under a geologically improbable pile of rocks. I shall expect your report as soon as possible. Dobson.

Perkins had hinted that Dobson's brain was now a puny and curdled thing. But still, I was crushed by this revelation. I slumped to the ground scrunching a piece of crumb lops wrapping my fists. tiny things with dozens of legs scurried around me climbing onto my socks and into my boots. I left them to get on with it. The dawn blasted me out of my stupor. I could not remain sitting around in the open country next to a dead man, the contents of his pockets strewn around me. I would look for all the world like a common robber. My first thought was to throw crown lop down the flooded mineshaft. But I was a couple of miles away from it now, and I could hardly drag his body that far. His girth was vast. I think that that was why Dobson had hired him. In his essay to write on among the wind minnows Dobson expanded at length upon his loading of all it was microscopic, elfin, or we he only employed me because I'm almost seven feet tall. Although I've been shrinking recently. It is most perplexing, the more so because my usual font of medical information, Dobson's dictionary has absolutely no light to shed on the condition. I had been planning to tax him with this, perhaps in a little PostScript, PostScript to my report. Well, now there would be no report. Aha, it was obvious obvious. Dobson would assume I was dead. And who was it gainsay him? snorting with glee. I hurriedly buried krumlov under a pile of rocks. The wasteland outside hooting yard, could hardly have been bettered for providing a geologically improbable mound, as demanded in the instructions. I heaped great lumps and collages of stuff on top of crumb lop bauxite with thought chert with mild ones with calcium. By the time I had finished, I was matted with filth. I gathered together chrome locks, pitiful agglomeration of all domains, including the Dirk and shoved the lot into my hammer sack. When I got back to hooting yard, it was lunchtime. I sat by the canal and devoured an enormous pot of boiling custard. One day I would be able to go home, but first I had to send Dobson a report. cron lops report. I stole a barge and spent a couple of years Morgan an unspeakable fan. I assume the air of a baudry sprouting, decisive mustachios and wearing a brocade mantle of some antiquity. I sold off the barges cargo of rotting vegetable matter, and made myself at home. I had wanted to write a seafaring yarn, but this would have to do as I sat at my little escrow, while water rats knowing my boots, the stench of bilgewater, wafting around me. I listened to the clanking of dredges and the screeching flocks of beasts with wings. I had never been so happy. I took up my pencil and wrote did Dobson scrim jaw has been obliterated. He did not put up a struggle. I am sending the duck to you under separate cover farewell from lop.

So that was the final second and final part of by aerostat to hooting out very old story read here because it was one of the few podcasts previously on podcast stories. So that was for podcast listeners. Just one point I should make the list of the cargo carried by moxa Blomqvist in her hot air balloon, the barometer, campus flags, anchors, coke jackets, packet of pamphlets, etc. that list is the real list of the stuff taken up in one of the very first balloon flights back in the 18th century. So there you go. You always learn something hooting yard. And I'd like to continue now. Yes, I'd like to continue now with a story. Very a shorter story called they've stolen Dobson's brain. Such a hullabaloo there was when they discovered Dobson's brain had been stolen. One cub reporter called it the hullabaloo to end all holla belews. Initially beside herself, marigold too soon grew to appreciate the peace and quiet the unhealthy Balu in the house itself, where Dobson lay perfectly still, as if asleep on a mattress. She'd painted and sang and fed the squirrels in the garden. Occasionally she tiptoed into the room where Dobson lay sprawled, and examine the sutures on his skull. The police scientist agreed with her that it looked like a professional job. Detective Captain Kirk pan was convinced that the pamphlet his brain was being kept in a jar within a 10 mile radius, and waited patiently for a ransom note. There was further hullabaloo when a picture was sent to the daily screech purporting to show the brain on a platter. But painstaking analysis showed that it was just a gray lump of dough. Someone that if a heroic pooch would find Dobson's brain while rummaging in a hedgerow in a curious foreshadowing of the theft and recovery of the jewel ram a trophy in 1966. A year later, marigold to listen to her Xavi a to get LPs and tended her hollyhocks and pasted cuttings into her scrapbook. Detective Captain kargh pan filled his pipe with untreated Uruguayan tobacco and paste up and down the garden path, praying for rain. He believed that a torrential downpour would flush out the brain thieves. Time passed and the hullabaloo died down and the cub reporter on the daily screech was embedded with a different police force investigating a different case. And then, despite the weather remaining barmy and some battered one Thursday morning, the post he came prancing along the lane carrying a package detective Captain Kirk pan lead marigold true and rapid fire she was deft where he was a butter fingers. She said, Gosh, she folded aside the last layer of blotting paper to reveal a pamphlet his brain. It was rather muddy as if it had been kept in a ditch, but she rinsed it thoroughly under the garden spigot and handed it to the police scientist who scampered upstairs and reinserted it into Dobson's head. No one ever did find out who had stolen it or where it had been stored, or whether any experiments had been carried out on it. Detective Captain Kirk pan pursued the case for another month or two. But he was a maverick. So his manner of conducting his investigations was highly idiosyncratic and passeth all understanding

one last little thing about Dobson now and then we'll move on to something else. For the end of the show. Committed Dobson lists often turn their mind to the perplexing question of how the out of print pamphleteer would have coped with the 21st century. It's difficult to imagine him in our world Oh bleeping digital flammarion Pap, is it not. But now I think I've stumbled upon something which clearly calls out for the great man's talents. According to a newspaper article about the red tape by which our Dowty coppers are being strangled quote, Some constabularies have a 44 page booklet for recording collisions between two cars. Unquote. Imagine that 44 page booklet, every time you have to record, you know, two cars colliding. Of course, as soon as I read this, my immediate thought was oh Dobson, If thou worked with us now, rather than subsisting in penury, the pamphleteer could make a pretty penny, offering his services to these police constabularies. He was capable of scribbling a 44 page pamphlet about any subject under the sun as easily as you or I could freeze to death in an Antarctic Blizzard, and with considerably more aplomb. Alas, he passed over to the ethereal realm before getting the chance to add to the canon. Such potential Masterworks as an essay upon the unfortunate collision between a Skoda and a Trabant or how I learned about a terrible road accident in which two cars smashed into each other as in humans speed. Still, next time I'm invited to play the parlor game. What would Dobson do today? I think I have a good chance of winning top points. And I said I'd move on from Dobson as far as I can recall, he's not mentioned in this next piece. Oh, he is he is sorry. Yes, this piece ends with a quotation from Dobson Hark, the Herald Angels are singing the song of staccato of the heroic worker. The Herald aid angels are legion, but there are only two stuck Arnold's that's right to one that's the carnival is busy at the Forge. Just like Felix Randall the farrier busy in his bellowing room, smelting iron ore hammering a huge sheet of steel with implacable industry. The other staccato is a pale aesthete. He has a bow tie, luxuriant locks, a thin Ronald Coleman mustache, and is lounging in a butter coffee meadow, propped on one immaculate elbow, reading a book of poetry. It is the collected lyrics of some forgotten noodling, progressive rock group. What will become of the to stir con of Hark, let us listen to what the Herald Angels are singing the hero worker at his Forge, the aesthete in a meadow, lamp cracked one and the other in surge, but both end on the gallows. Gone Gosh. So, according to the Herald Angels, both to Carnival will come to a sticky end, we must assume that they can accurately predict the future being Herald Angels. When they had finished their song, we sent one of our reporters to interview them. They were not happy about this, but put forward one of their number, an angel named anger wreck, Tom to act as their spokes Angel. Now, you and I know that anger rectum is a fumigating angel, rather than the true Herald Angel. Show it so it should be no surprise that the interview was unsatisfactory. In any event, our reporter found that his tape recorder malfunctioned, and all he could hear when he played back the tape was the sound of mighty and glorious angelic hosannas, not unlike spam in Allium by Thomas Tallis as Dobson one throat in another context. Angel sing and devils make a din, but the heroic worker pound his hammer and the poet praises Starling. I think that before too long, you and I on both stick Arnold's will be deafened by the Devil's Den.

And to end this week show some completely unrelated and irrelevant quotations from other writers. First from Jerome B. Lab a writing in his book disputed handwriting And exhaustive, valuable and comprehensive work upon one of the most important subjects of today. And I'm not making this up. Charlotte Bronte's writing seem to have been traced with a camera and needle. And Thackeray's, writing, while marvelously neat and precise, was so small that the best of eyes were needed to read it. Likewise, the writing of Captain Mariette was so microscopic that when he was interrupted in his labors, he was obliged to mark the place where he left off. by sticking a pin in the paper. Napoleons was worse than illegible, and it said that his letters from Germany to the Empress Josephine, were first thought to be rough maps. Byron's handwriting was nothing more than a scroll. The writing of Dickens was my newt. And he had a habit of writing with blue ink on blue paper. Fascinating, I think, and completely unrelated to that a quotation from my magazine for May 1918. How would you like to live on a tetrahedron? men say the earth will one day come to that many strange visions men have had of the world since it began, they used to think it a disk floating in water, there are still stupid people who believe it is flat. Every wise child knows that the truth is that the earth is practically a round ball. It will not always be like this. However, what the people of the world will live on in millions of years to come will probably be a tetrahedron. It all looks terribly dull, but it's really tremendously interesting. Let us think about it all. And so there you go, you can go away and think about that, about the fact that if you're still around the millions of years you'll be living on a tetrahedron and also your insight into the handwriting of any interesting historical figures. And yes, end of show. I'll be back next week. The website, www dot hooting yd.org has been very quiet for February but revived today with some new material. So do go and visit that and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
