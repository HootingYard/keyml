Hello resonance listening people. My name is Frankie. This is hooting out on the air. yesterday with Yoko Ono's 82nd birthday, so happy birthday, Yoko, and I hope all of you will send Yoko some money. But as a as a special tribute to Yoko, I'd like to do a radio version of one of her performance pieces. Ah, ah, that was one of Yoko's pieces. Now we'll move on with the rest of the show. But remember, Mike, your checks payable to Yoko Ono. And I'm sure she'll appreciate whatever help you can give her now that you've spent all your money on resonance, of course after the fundraiser last week. Anyway, few people alive today remember the highly entertaining musical act was beldo. Sopwith and his amazing tea strainers. Sopwith real name Cedric Williams sprang, was born in the damp building, hooting yard in 18, something or other and those his parents dragged him off for surfacing before he could even walk. He always record his birthplace with affection. At the turn of the century, when his popularity was at its height, Sopwith returned to hooting yard for the first time since infancy, to put on a Christmas show for the bewildered and the fraud. The show was of course a tremendous success, and so thrilled with the burlap shanked my oral offices of the town that they threw an impromptu banquet for socked with a tent was erected over the ice rink. The rink itself covered in tough coke matting and trestle tables were carried in piled high with such delicacies as were available in hooting yard at that time. Sopwith was ushered to a seat at the top table, and a hash descended on the 10th as the first course was brought in by the hooting yard duck pond cleaner, whose name was CAC bag. This geriatric half wit carried a capacious Shereen, containing gallons upon gallons of an iridescent broth, flavored with pap rime and bone meal and reportedly thoroughly indigestible tack bags swapped over ladle full of the broth into Sopwith rusty bowl, and the majestic entertainer was about to spoon some of the piping hot liquid into his mouth. When of a sudden the tent was filled with Cataclysm and pandemonium. Cedric, William sprang the words rang out re echoing around the canvas walls. Tom this have come for you. We will take you now. Poor Sopwith, ashen, trembling and incontinent could do little elf but to obey the bidding of the unseen tandis. As bout of purple lights spurted around the tent, and mesmerizing noises definitely the townsfolk, he crawled to the entrance flap, a piteous figure on his hands and knees. As soon as you say we're through the flap, the uproar ceased. The tent interior calmed, the Air Group still, clamor and rack were no more. But Cedric and William sprang alias grace bow lo Sopwith with gone like so many others, he had been taken by the tandis who knows why Water, water and like all who fell foul of Tunde ism, he was never seen on earth again.

His tea straighteners amazing though they may have been well disposed off through a public auction on the first anniversary of his banishment. All his other personnel effect was sold off burned Cost into canals or donated to educational institutions for tiny ones. All that is except for one item. The banquet was abandoned after the tandis had fallen upon the tent. Small urchins were plucked from the gutters to clear everything away, and we're given the uneaten food as a reward. One such jojen, who earlier that day had been held in trounced by the amazing tea strainers act was so upset by the disappearance of Sopwith that he carried the bowl of unswept broth away with him under his sordid tunic as a trophy. He kept it at home in his infected house until it began to mold and stink out even this most noise, some of hovels whereupon he took it to an apothecary very carefully encased what was left of the broth in a glass file, the very file, which is today found underneath the water pipes in the janitors cupboard next to the boiler room in the basement of the museum at hooting yard, where it can be viewed by appointment only.

I had a dream. I dreamed I was a passenger in a mini bus. And I was accompanied by several old friends from years ago, people I haven't seen for decades, and by Quakers, and for reasons never made explicit in the dream, everybody in the minibus thoroughly disapproved of me. My sense of this was vivid and distressing. And I was very glad to wake up from it. I told pansy cradled you I'd had a bad dream. I was the subject of disapproval. I said, she laughed. When people say they have bad dreams, you expect them to say I was terrified or something similar. But no, you were merely subject to disapproval. She found this highly amusing. Later, I was able to reflect that things could be much worse. I learned that over and was maternal grandfather was told by a foolish friend that a guaranteed cure for blindness was to have all of one's teeth removed. So he arranged for this to be done, contracted blood poisoning as a result, and died at the age of 43.

drew a picture of a vestige of trouser. As I recall, it was intended as one of a series of clues in a detective story, which I also recall was never actually written. The plotting of a proper detective story always seemed to me out with the range of whatever talents I possess. This is a pity as I would like few things better than to write a cracking who done it. One that leaves the reader guessing until the very final paragraph. And they're after gulping open mouth, with perhaps a trail of drool slowly descending from their lower lip, maintaining that stump stillness for several minutes before regaining their wits. I can think of several books I've read over the years which have left me in such a state. And not all of them were who done it, nor if I tally them up in my poor memory than any of them contain anywhere within them, a vestige of trouser. After all, in fiction, as in life, we usually encounter trousers how do we not so I'm sure I would remember a book with a vestige of trouser in it. Just as I remember a pen and ink drawing I made about 30 years ago of such a thing. What I do not know is why that drawing has come bubbling to the surface of my brain today of all days. Perhaps in the Some world or universe running parallel with this one today is vestige of trouser day. And faint signals from that world or universe of unaccountably pierced the fabric of my own world. But that smacks of detective of science fiction, not detective fiction. And I always think it best to draw a veil over the conjectures of science fiction. When I say draw a veil, I do not mean draw a picture of a veil. As I once drew a picture of a vestige of trouser, I'm using a different sense of the word draw. But you knew that and didn't need me to tell you, which makes me wonder why I'm still prattling on pointlessly when I might be better occupied gulping open mouthed stand and still withdrawal falling from my lips.

When I was first invited to present a show on resonance, way back in 2004, my immediate enthusiasm was tempered by a certain anxiety. I was fretful. Perhaps I did not have a radio voice. And that as soon as I was stuck in front of a microphone, I would screech like a screech jail. or indeed, do an impersonation of a Yoko Ono performance piece. In any case, listeners would lunge towards the off button, desperate to stop the hideous caterwauling and lapse into blesseds silence. So before accepting the kind offer to do a show, I took myself off to an elocution inist Miss blossom Christ's bloods establishment was on the top floor of a tall and ramshackle and quite possibly condemned building in an insalubrious part of town. It did not enjoy a lift, and by the time I'd loved myself up the stairs, I was breathless and panting before she even said Hello, Miss blossom was intent on exacting payment from me in cash. From my first lesson. I emptied my pockets of coinage, which she immediately squirreled away in was like a battered tobacco tin. I was given to understand that my lesson would begin when I stopped panting, which I truly did several minutes later. During this time, Miss blossom paid no attention to me whatsoever, but busied herself with her birds, innumerable birds housed in innumerable bird cages, hanging from innumerable rafters. I am no ornithologist, but I think at least one of them was a screech child. Eventually, my lesson began when speaking aloud, announced Miss blossom in a screech. The most important thing is the formation of the vowel sounds. It was at this point I decided to put my cut my losses and leave over a decade has passed since the unfortunate episode. In that time, I've continued to present hooting out on the air every week with the occasional lacuna. And I do not think that at any time I have found it necessary to imitate the sound of a vole nor a beaver, nor a shrew, nor even an otter.

From the porthole of your bath escape, you see a pair of crabs scuttling across the floor of a silent sea. They are discussing the poetry of TS Eliot. It might be thought that critical analysis of modernist verse requires higher cognitive functions than those possessed by crabs, whose brains are tiny. Indeed, they're about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen. But you might be surprised. The difficulty for you is one of translation. crabs have fairly rudimentary communication skills, but they do communicate with each other. And sometimes the subject of those communications might be the love song of great Alfred Prufrock. But you would not know this behind the reinforced glass of your Baptist gave porthole, you would just say a pair of scuttling crabs, and have no idea what was going on in their strange little heads. What you would need is some sort of manual clearly written to enable you to decipher the signals being passed from crab to crab. at time of writing, no such manual exists. But there you are, at the bottom of the silence See, with a perfect view. Perhaps fate has decreed that you are the person to write that manual to learn to communicate with crabs in their own language. It will probably take months if not years of study. And of course, you do not have that much time because before long your oxygen supply will be exhausted, and you will have to return to the surface of the silent sea and return the Baptist gave to the Chandler from whom you hired it. So before surfacing, it will be a good idea to point your camera at the pair of crabs and film their discussion of TS Eliot for several minutes. You will then be able to study the film Oso brow farrowing Lee in the comfort of your permanently oxygenated seaside readout. We should all look forward to the publishers announcement of a clearly written manual of rudimentary crab communication, including several chapters of crab exegesis of the poetry of TS Eliot, translated into human

when James Newell Osterberg Jr. was a tiny infant, he was fed on a diet of mashed up pap made from eggs. It was the sequence memory of these slots that informed his later decision when embarking upon a career as a musical performer to adopt the pseudonym eggy Pap, a type of graphic error or rather to typographic errors, rendered the nine differently on the label of his first vinyl waxing, deploying one of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies Avalon letter, Osterberg determined to honor his era as a hidden intention and retained the inaccurate pseudonym throughout his subsequent career. That was from my forthcoming book, all you need to know about ag pap.

Quite often a farmer will choose to give one of his cows and Buttercup. This is lost on the cow itself, which is too stupid to understand the concept of names for things. When a cow gazes upon the world it is as if through a dense mental fog. We can go some way to replicating this, even with our much mighty of brainpower. For instance, I once spent a morning a misty morning, standing in a field, chewing on a mouthful of uprooted grass, staring straight ahead and emptying my mind of all, and any stint at all in any stimulus. using a technique I learned from a witch doctor. It was a salutary experience. And afterwards, I felt I had a much greater understanding of the interior world of a cow. I continued the experiment by asking people to call me Buttercup to see if I would respond when my name was spoken aloud. I did not I respond on that day or on any other day thereafter. If somebody called out in my hearing, Oh, Mr. Key, my ears would prick up and I would look around for whomsoever had called my name. And when I spotted them raise an eyebrow and answer. Yes. What is it you want my good fellow or as it may be my good woman or even young chin. But I found that when somebody yelled Buttercup, Buttercup, my immediate reaction was to assume I had fallen among florists. It can be quite unnerving to fall among florists, particularly when there's a gang of them. They tend to hold in their clenched fist. bunches of buttercups, or daffodils or God alone knows how many different types of flowers and they will thrust them under your nose while holding out the open palm of their free hand in expectation of coinage. The idea is that you give them money, and in return, they present you with a bunch of butter cups or whatever. But when there is a whole saturation of florists surrounding you, importuning you, it's no easy matter to pick one out of the crowd and by his sprig in preference to any other sprig. And it's unlikely you're carrying enough cash to be able to afford all the balloons thrust at you. Whenever I fall among florists in this manner, I remember the lessons I learned from the witch doctor, and I assume the mean of a cow, usually, but not always. The florists will disperse. If the florists do not disperse, the best idea is to snap out of your cow crowns, and to shake a stick at them, the more wildly the better accompanying the wild shaking of the stick with blood curdling screens. Production of such screens can also be taught to you by any witch doctor worth their salt. If you intend to eat a dish of buttercups, either raw or cooked, do not garnish them with salt. If on the other hand, you have it in mind to eat a cow called Buttercup, a sprinkle of salt does not go amiss, and will make the meat more palatable. for vegetarians. A cow made out of marzipan is an acceptable substitute. But here again, as with the buffet cups, it should be innocent of salt seasoning. Never eat buffet cups in the presence of a florist.

In 1932, the journalist Helen Swofford wrote, I am seriously concerned at the stupidity of so called scientist joined by a writer on philosophy going into the heart mountains to make a goat stand in a ring midnight to see if, when a Latin incantation was recited, the animal would turn into a young man. He was referring to the famous experiment the experiment on the Brocken on the peak of the Brocken in the hearts mountains in 1932. And I'm going to tell you all about that on the show next week. But the end of this week's show, we've got a little treat for you, which is a few weeks ago, you may recall at the end of the show, I read a verse called dear bonkers Maisie one of the few folk songs which is about lead poisoning, and it's now been set to music by out of Spaceman. It's on a couple of gigs with me in the past. I think if I can't quite remember the name, the name of the band he's formed to perform this I think it's the reformed cripples palm court orchestra or trio or something like that. I will try and correct that next week. But anyway, here is outerspace man doing his version of day a bonkers Maisie, and that will play you out for this week. And I'll be back next week to tell you all about goats turning into beautiful young men.
