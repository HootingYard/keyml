Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. Once upon a time, there was a groovy janitor. That is about all there is to say about him. He was groovy. And he was a janitor. Or he was a janitor. And he was groovy. These two statements are not identical. We must be alert to nuance. Do we give more or less weight to his janitor dumb or to his grooviness matches, we might wish to grant them equal importance. We know in our heart of hearts that to do so is blind idiocy. I'll come on, admit it. You're alert you're leaning, even if only slightly in terms of your level of interest in this majestic piece of prose towards the janitor Enos or the groove as a janitor. The grooving janitor was often to be found in a corridor with a mop and a pail, rattling a bunch of keys on perhaps bearing down upon a fixture or fitting armed with a hammer or a screwdriver or a wrench. As a person of groove, the groovy janitor, while so engaged, would often be snapping his fingers to the latest sounds from some of our top beat groups. A long but not exhaustive list of which has been compiled by Bernard Levin, shall we re familiarize ourselves with the roll call. And I quote Bernard Levin, some big groups were almost as famous and successful as the Beatles. Some were known only to the most devoted aficionados, but all added to the atmosphere of the decade, and the aisle was full of noises as never before. Coming from among others, the Rolling Stones, the big trees, the monkeys, the doors, the cream, the Mothers of Invention, the seekers, the who the small faces, the pretty things, the animals, the Pink Floyd, the scaffold, the Grateful Dead, the tremeloes, the family, the Supremes, the holding company, the Four Tops, the made Zeppelin, the shadows, the exploding galaxy, the editors, the fugs the golds, the kink, the hermit's the paper dolls, the breakaways, the grease band, The casuals, the amen corner, the big sound, the flirtations, the heard the marbles, the status quo, the New York Public Library for Holly's, the foundation's the electric havens, the Four Seasons, the bachelor's, the safe shells, the love affair, the fifth dimension, the Three Dog Night, the equals the vagabonds, the marmalade, the mind benders, the Moody Blues, the muret the coos days children, the plastic Penny, the protocol, Hiram, the trogs, the fruit machine, the union gap, the 1910 fruit gum company, the big boys, the Fairport Convention, Vanity Fair, the harmony grass, the aces, the young tradition, the nice, the Dubliners, the tinker's, the Fleetwood Mac, the incredible stringband the web, the little free rock, the blood when pig build Liverpool seen the spooky tooth, the third ear, the high tide, The Mamas and papas, the carnations, the pacemakers, from Genesis to Revelation, the Ohara Express, the pentangle, the chicken shack, the blind faith, the foremost the searchers, before pennies, the bar Kays, the unit four plus two, the head hoppers anonymous, the Apple Jacks, the Box Tops, the Edison Whitehouse, the blood, sweat and tears, the vibrations and the Radha Krishna temple. From this we can reduce that our groovy janitor was Being groovy and a janitor in the 1960s but that was half a century ago. He is 50 years older now. creaking wrinkle rotted near blind and to mere balls and toothless gasping weekly from a bed in a Mercy Home.

It is no longer accurate to describe him as a janitor, for he has carried out no janitorial duties for 20 years at least. We can call him an ex janitor, or a retired janitor. And one of his grooviness. Is he still groovy? Let us ask the superintendent of the Mercy Home, Mrs. pan to for the retired janitor lying sprawled in his arm caught on hopeless ward. You're asking me if he's groovy. Define your terms, please. We set out for her the chief characteristics of grooviness in alphabetical order supported by illustrative diagrams we have tucked in our pocket for just such an eventuality. I see says Mrs. Pan tuefel vote Ashley is wearing a pair of very stylish mirror sunglasses. We cannot be sure of the truth of this remark. I would say she continues taking everything into account that the ex janitor has indeed retained his grooviness. Only the other morning as one of the skivvies attended today's bedpan. She noted that he was babbling incoherently in his weakened Reedy voice. With great presence of mind she made a tape of his gibbering on the Mercy Home cassette recorder. We played it back during the staff meeting at lunchtime while eating fruit. At first, the tape yielded nothing intelligible. But when we pick picked up our ears and concentrated very hard, we revised the retired janitor was reciting how by Allen ginsburg. What could be groovier than that? It Fried my wig daddy? Oh. The moral of the story is that while janitor dumb may fade away and vanish. grooviness prevails. Let that be a lesson to you.

handed me that traffic saved to the ornithologist to his help meet. Now it so happened that the helpmeet was a dimwit who could not tell one bird from another, by all had beaks and feathers so far as he was aware, but beyond that he wallowed in a seething maelstrom of bird ignorance. How then, we might wonder, did he get the plum job of ornithologist helped me and they assured It was a plum job indeed, as both plumbers and jobs go, it had been advertised as such in the plums section of the daily orders on logical helpmeet situations vacant listings magazine price for pumps, available from several tobacconist kiosks in pointy town and overruns. On the night before he saw the advertisement, the dimwit slept in the open air under a viaduct. This was not because he had no home to go to for a home he had, and what a home a man's with serried Belvedere is and too many servants to count. But the dimwit the day before had foolishly gone a wandering and become hopelessly lost. This was what usually happened when he strayed from the grounds of the man's. Not only was he ignorant of birds, but they have absolutely no sense of direction. His papaya had tried to teach him to orient his position on our spinning globe by studying the sun in the day and the stars in the night. But such matters were not within his grasp. He had difficulty craning his neck at the correct angle. So that is head and eyes were pointing at the sky. This was not on account of any malformation of his neck. It was more a case of absent mindedness, he would begin to adjust his head to the correct angle and then be distracted by say, the ground level sight of the Heron eating a mole and forget what he was doing. He could not of course, have identified the Heron as a Heron northern model as a model. He was such an dimwit, but he would be transfixed by the spectacle and gape tongue lolling from his mouth drawn, dribbling down his chin, until one of the servants was dispatched to come and collect him, tie him to the end of a tethering rope and pull him gently back into the man's, where papaya, despairing stood hunched between a globe and an aura re spinning them turn and turn about his eyes wet with tears. Waking under the viaduct dawn that day, the dim wet desert and Durrell then found himself some hours later, after tobacconists kiosk hard by sawdust bridge. And then the kiosk in a puddle sat a pile of unsold copies of the previous day's edition of The Daily ornithological help meet situations vacant, tied up with string. What prompted the dimwit to undo the bundle and take a copy of the magazine and repair to a verdant Arbor were courting couples had long ago scratched their initials and cack handed hearts in twined, on the now rotting wood of the ruin bench, and sat up on the bench, and leafed through the puzzle wet magazine and read and read again and read a third time. The advertisement for a plum job as helped me to tip top ornithologist Bruno lapu. Bell, we shall never know. What we do know is that as chance would have it, or was it written in the stars Bruno lapu Bell himself came clattering into the arbor for a shifty fact break. clattering because he was wearing his scarecrow suit hung with mariadb scraps of tin shifty because he's on a theological Research Station. Heart had been declared a no smoking zone by ornithologist even more Tip Top than he. The ornithologist and the dimwit fell into conversation on the shattered bench. At this date, we cannot piece together what they spoke of, but far, far away. The Gulf of Tonkin incident had recently occurred, so it may be that it acted as an icebreaker. However,

however, it was Bruno lapu Bell was persuaded within 15 minutes that the dimwit would make a splendid and devoted helpmeet. He tied a tethering rope to his new employee and pull him gently back to the heart. After a cup of tea and a guided tour of the heart, and another shifty fag break, the ornithologist uttered the fateful words hand me that traffic, he said, I need to be met with a look of staggeringly fathomless incomprehension. Shortly afterwards, one of the servants from the man's appeared having cracked down the den with with bloodhounds. He found Bruno lapu Bell slumped in his chair with his head in his hands. And the dimwit standing beside him clutching a marshmallow.

Last week was a show devoted entirely to plumbers or plumber related pros and astute listeners will realize that I'm up to the same trick this week because of course that piece I just read with plumber lighted or at least mentioned plums, fingertip plums. And, and so does the piece I'm about to read to you now. Remind me Dobson said marigold to one morning over breakfast. Did you ever write that pamphlet you planned about the bandicoot The out of print pamphleteer was fumbling with his fork, trying to spear on its tines, one of the shriveled boiled otter heads swimming in a broth of gummy pappe with duckweed in his breakfast bowl. So terrific was his concentration that he barely heard. He's in amaranta. And he repeated the question after taking a swig of new breakfast variety squelch Joe from her tumbler. Dobson threw in the towel, put down his fork and reached for a stick of celery style impacted vegetable matter. waiving it in a show of flamboyance, he announced, I will never write another word about birds. This exchange took place during the closing stages of the Battle of dnpm foods. So with hindsight, we're able to note that Dobson statement was ludicrously inaccurate. I do adore your non sequiturs. Dobson said marigold too. But do tell I'm agog to know about the bandicoot pamphlet his mouthful of curiously tasteless vegetable matter. Dobson gazed at his enamorado as if she had taken leave of her senses. His table manners being impeccable, he did not attempt an immediate reply marigold waited upon his munching she herself was a dab hand with a fork and the auto heads and unfinished her breakfast some minutes earlier. Your remark regarding non sequiturs seems to me a non sequitur, in and of itself, said Dobson. Eventually, then his voice rising, shouted, be laughed at me. When I say I shall never again write a single word on the subject of birds. I mean it. And now I'm going to go out in the rain to no apparent purpose. I can think of the purpose Dobson said marigold, too. While you're out in this apocalyptic downpour. Perhaps you could stop by the kiosk in the shadow of the viaduct and pick up a copy of the daily digest of the doings of small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores for me. I think struggled to dawn his Eritrean unofficial goat wizard boot with their exceedingly complicated lacing protocol. The pamphleteer said, you don't normally take that publication. Is there any reason for the sudden interest? I think there might be something in it that I want to show you Dobson she said an enigmatic smile on her lips. stamping his feet to finally lodge them firmly into his boots. Dobson took his hat and cold and crashed out of the door into the rain. He wondered why on earth marigold crew thought he might be interested in small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores when his head was filled with unrelated matters, including Hungarian football, a spherical put gas clinky plunky piano music, weird sausages, asteroid belt, and plums. And one thing I am most definitely not interested in. He shouted at a swan as he passed the pond is birds, any birds, all birds, and that includes use warm, and your pals the teal and mergansers buffleheads and kuten bandicoots. Later, sopping wet. Dobson arrived home with a copy of the daily digest of the doings of small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores, which the kiosk guest had very thoughtfully plopped into a waterproof bag for him as a small extra charge. Here is your magazine he said tossing it onto the table as a puddle formed around his feet.

marigold crew took it from the bag leaf through it, analyze it on a short and interesting article illustrated with several black and white snapshot taken by Tip Top marsupial snapper rx superbill on the subject of the bandicoot when you have a moment Dobbs and she said you might want to take a look at this I shall make a pot of tea and shortly afterwards, the out of print pamphleteer learned today's horror that everything he had intended to say about bandicoot in his projected pamphlet, hundreds of pages of scribbled notes and jottings and Ill turned sentences of Foolish conjecture was as dust was as dust and ashes, all of it. Every word was Aaron nonsense. The bandicoot was not a type of cute. It was not even a type of bird. Dobson slumped in his chair and held his head in his hands. The cup of tea went cold.

I've never been able to decide whether I prefer a sock or a Philip to be given a sock can be immediately gratifying. But when you're able at leisure to consider what you really wanted, and then to be thunderstruck at the realization, you've been fobbed off with us fobbed off with a sock gratification can curdle swiftly into frustration, resentment, and in certain circumstances, psychopathic violence. Affiliate on the other hand, can come out of nowhere, unbidden, and set you up for the day or at least for a few minutes, until your inner to once again nor that by whatever gnaws at them, that differs from person to person. The tonic effect then of both the salt and the Philip tend towards the ephemeral. One could argue that not withstanding the Philip is preferable. This is because when it wears off, and you're once again plunged into remorseless misery, there is not the concomitant objection you get with the wearing of dejection you get with the wearing off of the SOP, vis the knowledge that you've been fobbed off? You can't be fobbed off with a Philip. That's not in the nature of Philips, though it is part and parcel of the SOP. We can perhaps grasp this more firmly by considering a concrete example. Here is Dobson from his pamphlet, what I have to say in toto about SOPs and Phillips out of print. It was a day in that blue month September, silent beneath the plum trees slender shade, a nice juicy Carlsbad plum, I thought would be just the Philip I needed. It so happened that I was plunged in remorseless misery and my innards were being ignored by their intractable enemies, a legion of mental and emotional horrors. It would take far too long to list. Yes, the more I thought about it sprawled beneath the plum tree slender shade. The more I craved the Filip I would get from munching one of those plums. I've never been the sprightliness Creek climbers, but on that day in that bloom on September, it so happened to that I was wearing my Bolivian rainforest wardens tree climbing boots. What a happy accident. I stood up, dusted the dust from my duffle coat, and prepared to clamber a little way up the trunk of the plum tree just high enough to pluck a plum. It was a strangely tall plum tree, as we're all its fellows in this orchard. Just as I was about to begin my climb, I was disconcerted to see striding towards me aiming a shotgun the orchardist I knew he was the orchardist because of his proprietorial manner of striding across the loam and the Badger affixed to his duffle coat over his heart. OE he shouted, do not think for one minute you can climb and pluck a plum of mine from my plum tree. Nothing was further from my mind. I lied. I am not the plummeting type. he shoved the barrel of his shotgun into my belly. I'm pleased to hear it, he said. Often I find picnickers another reprobates lurking in my orchard, who think the mounting of a nice juicy karlsbad plum is just the Philip by need to wrench them or bit temporarily out of their misery and Horace. Don't you fret about me on that score. I said I'm as happy as a lark. This all of the logical Sally was a blatant fib, as my countenance was downcast and gloomy. It served however, to bamboozle we orchardist he is he hoisted the shotgun over his shoulder and mumbled something About the nesting habits of locks I thought it best to skedaddle out of the orchard and find somewhere else to slump on that day in that blue month September. As I trudged along the towpath of the old canal past the cement works and the marmalade factory, I still crave the Philip of a plums to munch. pausing to sit on a canalside bench place there in honor of Robert Fripp, I took from the inside pocket of my duffle coat, that gadgeteer of fruit, which in those days, I always carried with me. If I could not steal a plum from an orchard, I could buy one from a fruit era. I was young then you see, and my brain was in proper working order. Having ascertained that the nearest fruit for was a short bus ride away. I made my way to the bus stop and waited for a bus. When the bus arrived I boarded it. I sat down the bus conductor took my fair, peering out of the window at the sky. I became lost in thought about my imminent plum. I could almost taste it. What a Philip it would be.

Frank Key  26:11
Shortly afterwards, I alighted from the bus at another bus stop and cross the road enter the freaker as he was a curiously monkey like man, though his manners were polished. How may I be of assistance to you on this day in that blue month September? he asked. I would like to buy a nice juicy Carlsbad plumb please. I said I'm afraid I sold my last plumb Carl's baghel Carlsbad or no. Just 15 minutes ago to a communist German playwright, he said So may I recommend instead of conference pair, there would be no Philip for me. Instead, I was being fobbed off with a SOP. careful study of this passage will reward the reader with a dazzling insight into the Filip and the SOP. And this in spite of the fact that Dobson does not tell us whether he accepted the fruit or an offer of a conference pair. It was long thought that he addressed this in his pamphlet, the blue September of conference pairs out of print, but recent textual x addresses by hot headed young Dobbs inist Ted ccaq demonstrate pretty damn conclusively that the September referred to in that pamphlet was after not before the Tet offensive.

And that's all we have time for this week. Last end of this week show. Do you know what I'm going to threaten you with further stories involving plumbers next week? Let's see what happens Shall we? and have a good week. And just to let you know that I spent yesterday helping someone design a synthesizer. That doesn't happen very often. Bye bye.
