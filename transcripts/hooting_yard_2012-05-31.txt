Good evening, you are indeed tuned to resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. When one is covered from head to toe in SAP your writing boils, one finds the invitations to sophisticated cocktail parties. Unlike the Boyle's dry up. I discovered this through personal experience. There was a time when, like job, I was tested by the Lord. One such test the Lord devised was to strike me with a plague of boils. It could not have come at a worse time, hot on the heels of a plague of locusts, an infestation of mice and a bloody ridiculous gas bill. I wouldn't mind but it's not as if I actually get to see any of the gas unless it's already up in flames burning away. But try telling that to the automaton on the other end of the so called gas helpline or we get as a flea in your ear. Speaking of which, I forgot to mention the plague of fleas. That was another test from the Lord between the locusts and the mice. So as you can imagine, I was not best pleased to find myself one day completely covered in suppurating Boyles, particularly when I was drew to attend a sophisticated cocktail party that very evening. Oh, Lord, I implored on my knees. I understand why the tour mentors to me so far I am but a sniveling wreck and worthy to crawl upon my belly like a worm or other creeping thing. Having said that, could the perhaps show mercy and remove from my hideous flesh this plague of separating boils, given that I have received an invitation to attend a sophisticated cocktail party this evening, and in my present state, and barely able to present myself in civilized human company. To which I'm afraid the Lord replied in a booming authoritarian rah, which made the walls tremble. I cannot recall his precise words, but the tone was not reassuring. I got the distinct impression that he expected me to suffer the Boyles in silence, with hopeless reservation to his lordly whims, and not to bother him with pathetic self pitying supplications. So, after a while, I got to my feet and went out to the chemist. Luckily, there were not many people about at this early hour, those few that did see me looked on me with horror, or turn their backs or shielded their eyes. One or two vomited. I cannot say I blame them. As before leaving the house i'd checked my appearance in the hallway mirror. I was not a pretty sight. I dressed as best I could, in a few pitiful mice and nibbled rags the Lord had seen fit to leave me with and I wafted a sprig of hyacinths in front of me as I walked to mosque as far as possible we stink of the separations, which was considerable. The chemists that I went back a long way, having been childhood tobogganing pounds. Indeed, we even Tobago toboggan as adults, when conditions were right on the slopes, and he was able to drag himself away from his dispensary. I knew that he too, had been driven crackers by his gas bills. So I expected a degree of sympathy as I pushed open the door and the little bell claimed the whole interview behind his counter by sight, Spivak at all the holy martyrs of many evil Ravenna, he cried, you're a sight for sore eyes. I nodded in agreement, which was unwise as a glob of pass was shaken free from one of my boils and landed on the clean scrubs linoleum of the chemist shop floor. The least you can do is mop that up, he said, handing me a mop. I did so while my Powell rummaged among his pills and potions for a suitable undulant

I can't promise this will eradicate your suppurating boils, he said, handing me a tube of Dr Baxter's paitent palliative cream for separating boiled sores and buboes but it is a cream and it is a palliative. So in Canada With your sprig of hyacinth, it might make you a slightly less noise similar offensive creature. I thanked him and paid him and aged carefully out of the door, hoping not to leave any further deposits of pass on the linoleum. Are you up for some tobogganing come Sunday? He called after me, which was thoughtful often, but we both knew I could hardly enjoy swooping down a snowy slope aboard a toboggan while plagued by separating boils. That is in the hands of the Lord, I replied, and hurried off along the lane towards the canal. I would find a shrubbery sheltered bench somewhere on the towpath and smear my boys with Underland that at least was the plan. I was not to know nor had my power chemist team fit to warn me that dr. Baxter when concocting his pattern palliative cream for separating boils, sores and buboes had used several ingredients which in combination proved absolutely irresistible to swans. That's it was that as I hunkered in the shelter of shrubbery on a bench smearing my Boyle's a baker's dozen of swans came paddling out of the canal and surrounded me. Now it is one of my iron rules and never to antagonize a swan. So I kept towed away as quietly as I could, with only a few of my boils smeared. But the swans driven to delirium by the whiff of Dr. Baxter's recipe, pursued me. I made it home and they simply waited outside, occasionally something their big toe against the front door.

When evening came and it was time for me to leave for the sophisticated cocktail party, the swans were still there. I had no choice but to let them follow me along the lane and pass the allotments and through the tunnel under the bypass and pass the industrial estate and the Science Park and the oil refinery, and the other allotments until I reached the gated community where in the sophisticated cocktail party was taking place. I flashed my permit at the security guard in the booth, who depressed the knob which opened the gate. I hoped he would shut it again quickly to keep the swans out. But he seemed to think that they were my pet so closely Did they tell me that's it was that I arrived at the sophisticated cocktail party, wafting my sprig of hyacinth, covered from head to toe in separating boils made only slightly less noise similar offensive by Dr. Baxter's pattern palliative cream, and accompanied by a gaggle of delirious swans. I pluck the drink from a tray and leaned as insouciantly as I could against a mantel piece. I was not a social success. In fact, throughout the evening, the only person who came within 10 feet of me was a blind flapper with a streaming cold which should robbed her of her sense of smell. We were getting on like a house on fire until she confessed that she was allergic to swans. I did the gentlemanly thing, and revealed that there were 13 swans in close proximity. Ah, she said, That explains why I have developed a splitting headache have a ringing in my ears, and pins and needles in my extremities. I better go out onto the balcony away from your pet swans, or I'm liable to break out in sappy writing boiled all over my body. Toodle Pip. Wait, I cried. The swans are not my pet. And I have a half full cube of Dr Baxter's pattern palliative cream for separating boiled sores and buboes. But she was already gone. A social pariah. I last realized I had outstayed my welcome and I made my way home swans in tow. The Lord alone knew when next I would be invited to a sophisticated cocktail party. So I got down on my knees and asked him back caveman booming authoritarian rah. Again, I could not make out the individual words. But the tone was, if anything even less reassuring that it had been in the morning. I headed for bed convinced that those swans are going to be following me for the rest of my life. When I opened the bedroom door, there they were, they had somehow managed to get into the house and now lined up all 13 of them at the foot of the bed. They're black eyes gazing at me, pitiless, savage, and mad.

should report that I'm not feeling very well. I think we've come over a bit faint. I'm going to try to get through the next piece. But if I can't, then we'll play something else until seven o'clock. But don't worry, I'm all right, but just not feeling 100% chipper anyway, actually, you know, I think I'll do that could can we're gonna play something else. I'm going to lie down somewhere. Sorry about that, but I really am not feeling very well. So I will be back next week with some other stuff. But I'm not really sure I'm capable of continuing with the show this week. Bye bye bye.
