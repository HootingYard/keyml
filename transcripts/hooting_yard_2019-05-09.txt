Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hunting out on the air. Now. Dobson lived in the era before mobile phones, of course. So when he found himself imperiled in an isolated spot, he had to harness every last scrap of ingenuity to summon help you or I would simply make a call on our mobile. Well, you would, but I wouldn't, because I don't own a mobile phone, and I never shall for they are an abomination unto me. But this was not an option for Dobson. So what did he do? Let us take a closer look at the circumstances. It was a Tuesday in February. football fans who are grieving the loss of the Busby Babes in the Munich air disaster. Pope Pius the 12th and declared the St. Clair was to be the patron saint of television, and little blind David Blunkett was just 11 years old. Meanwhile, Dobson got lost on an ill advised hiking expedition and found himself exhausted in a spinny menaced by feral goats. The out of print pamphleteer had also managed to get himself hopelessly entangled in a thicket of thorny brambly, creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles. That's the kind of spinny it was at least 20 miles from the nearest village, and with no path nor country lanes leading anywhere close to it. They was it is true a big pylon a couple of dozen yards away, but it was a lone pylon unconnected to any kind of electrical grid or other wiring system, a pipe on the purpose of which was unknown, and it was a pylon of rust, suggestive of abandonment and disuse. This was not the first time Dobson had been in a hiking pickle, and it would not be the last. Indeed, later in life, he had enough material to furnish your pamphlet entitled, an anthology of disastrous hiking mishaps, cobbled together from a lifetime of ill styled rustic pursuits out of print. What was significant about this particular pickle was the manner in which Dobson succeeded in extricating himself from it. This was the period during which he had joined an experimental knitting circle. And as luck would have it, he had in his Pipi bag that day, his latest project, it was an interpretation in wall of the wreck of the Deutsch land by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Dobson realized that when fully unraveled, the yarn would stretch for miles. He sat down in the brambles lit his pipe, took the scrunched up woolen masterpiece out of his pity bag and unraveled unraveled unraveled unraveled unraveled unraveled unraveled. Two hours later, he was still unraveling. The sun was setting by this by the time he was done, but Dobson had no fear of the night for he was sanguine. frequently asked question, why didn't the pamphleteer use his portable metal Tapping Machine to call for help? Answer, he was unable to use his portable metal Tapping Machine because there was no ground level pneumatic hub within reach. The wall fully unraveled Dobson tapped out his pipe on a stone and beckoned to one of the Federal toggenburg the goats were still gathered in a gang on the edge of the spinny and it's a mystery why they had not attacked the Bramble trapped pamphleteer. In the anthology, Dobson suggested that a combination of accurate pipe smoke unraveled wall and his sanguine nature had deterred the goats. But it seems that for once he was being modest. Almost certainly, the decisive factor was Dobson's eerie ability to mesmerize goats, especially toggenburg.

Frank Key  05:06
It is a skill which has not been much remarked upon, possibly because Dobson himself made light of it, and Curiously, never devoted a pamphlet to the subject. But he had been practicing goat mesmerizing, since he was a baby in arms. And now he's experienced paid off, beckoning a toggenburg as I said, Dobson tied one end of the length of war around one of its satanic horns, then whispered goat language into it here. We do not know what he said. But presumably it was something like scamper away goat in a straight line, and do not stop until you reach a village. It was not a village that the goat scampered to, however, three hours after being entranced it came to world wire fence, chewed its way through, and in so doing set off a hideous caterwauling alarm system. The night was filled with noise, and the toggenburg was caught in the white glare of a CLI glide. Within seconds it was surrounded by a clumping troupe of visored commandos armed with Simon and Garfunkel rifles. inadvertently, the mesmerized Capricorn had stumbled into a top secret military intelligence compound. A commando with a captain's badge bundled the goat onto a bauxite cradle chained to a winch, while a second commando, this one with a cadet badge untied the wool from its home. miles away. Dobson was smoking his pipe and lackadaisically paying out the wall hand over hand. Suddenly, he felt like a jerk and held on tight. And then he was yanked free of the thought he brambly, creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles, and dragged across a wasteland of fields and gravel pits and sumps and countryside filth until he fetched up the feet of the commandos who reel him in just as Midnight's truck. Dobson got out of a hiking pickle, only to find himself in a very alarming dilemma indeed, slap bang in the middle of a military intelligence compound. That was top secret for very good reasons. reasons which, even at a distance of 60 years, I am far too terrified to divulge. He was placed in a holding cell with the feral goat and interrogated at length. The rule was returned to him, and he asked for and was given a pair of knitting needles. Between interrogations, he was able to reenact the wreck of the Deutschland. Although much of his woolen reimagining of the lines about the tall man was gnawed into scritti by the toggenburg. By the time the commandos released the pamphleteer, having scrambled his brain pans so thoroughly, that he remembered nothing. After the spinny Richard mill house Nixon had published his book six crises, Pluto and Neptune were in alignment for the first time in 403 years, and little blind David Blunkett was no longer so little. Dobson returned home even more sanguine than before the hiking pickle. As for the feral goat, it stayed with the commandos. They adopted it as a pet, and called it Flossie

Frank Key  09:13
had a reader's letter or I suppose you'd call it a listeners letter. It's from Tim Fern. And he writes, Dear Mr. Key, I am a huge fan of hooting yard, and an even huge fan of computer and console games. Can you tell me if there are plans afoot for hooting yard based game I will be able to play on my Gameboy written or what have you? Oh dear, is all I can say. I can only assume that 10 is a teenage boy for only teenage boys ought to be playing computer games. teenage girls are busy editing the features page of The Guardian that so many adults spend Their time gaming is clear evidence of the culture of infantilization, which we see all around us. I recommend compulsory reading of the anatomy of melancholy by Robert Burton and in forced contemplation of the paintings of Oskar kokoschka as a start, meanwhile, somewhat shamefacedly and hypocritically, I do have to confess that I have granted a license to a Japanese software development company to create a thoroughly enticing game based on certain hooting yd characters. the working title for the game is fictional athlete bob bennett tavole magnificent sprinting and pole vaulting golden Uber challenge. As far as I can understand such things, particular challenge for players is to lead a little pixelated fictional athlete Bob knit to evolve avatar through a series of increasingly difficult virtual sporting tournaments. As one progresses through each level, cantankerous trainer old How old is on hand, coughing and spluttering on a variety of high tax cigarettes to offer tips and advice. The further along the player goes Of course, the less help is available from our help. And at the highest levels, he occupies a corner of the screen languishing in what looks like a sanatorium. The putative teenage purchaser of the game can choose from various options. You can play as fictional athletes Bob tavole, or compete against him. In this mode, old hollub act as a fiendish adversary given to such tactics as poisoning your pre sprint cornflakes, blinding you with pepper spray, or breaking your legs. You can also select different locations for the stadia in which the contest take place, including ancient Latvia, the Essex seaside town of j wick, and the mystic and frankly terrifying land the Gar alive with nightmarish monsters and things that creep upon the face of the earth. The only game setting which is fixed and unchangeable is the color scheme, which as you would expect, is sepia. The developers hope to gain some celebrity endorsements before the game is released, and I understand that they have already made tentative approaches to such luminaries as Krista Berg and David Blunkett. According to marketing strategist, a touchy feely version for the blind is predicted to outsell was sighted edition.

Frank Key  13:19
It's interesting to reflect that when I wrote that many years ago, I can still see properly and now of course, I can't say I would need the blanket version of the game if I were to play it. Although I'm told it hasn't yet appeared in the shops, maybe being trapped on the software giant went bust or something. Anyway. Like Kaspar Hauser. She was an enigma. Like Petra Vaughn Can't she wept bitter tears. And like woodcarver Steiner, she knew great ecstasy.

Frank Key  14:03
But was it a religious ecstasy? Or was it as for woodcarver Steiner, related to ski jumping at a championship level? Have you been so inclined, there is no doubt that tiny Enid could have been a top skier in spite of her clubfoot. For we know that if you never allowed that infirmity to dissuade her from the most remarkable exploits. Hang Gliding hot air ballooning, pole vaulting and daring undersea rescues, were among her many accomplishments, and she was only narrowly pipped to the post in a Lincoln sport contest. When her finish, Edgar became rattled and chirped skeeve wheat instead of siskey wet in the final minutes, yet we have no evidence Tiny Enid ever strapped on a pair of skis, nor dwelt in an area of snow fallen on sloping ground. Equally However, if hers was a religious ecstasy, were hard put to identify to what brand of supernatural belief it could be ascribed to new tiny Enid crinkle in Glee, as they recall that, like Benjamin Perry, she spattered Catholic priests. So I think we can rule out the rap thing guristas as we can confidently dismiss any connection to Aztec fundamentalism, given tiny Enid reported remarks on 10 X a hacker attack tel tacky, the goddess of sweet, sweet sweat above whom she described as far too sweaty. This is not the place to examine tiny enough somewhat unseemly preoccupation with both human and divine sweat for we must keep on track. The track is the one we hoped would lead us to know the source of tiny Enid great ecstasy. With woodcarver Steiner, we know where we stand, as we do with St. Teresa of Aviva, and any number of visionary enthusiasts and mystics throughout the ages. But what can we say of the great ecstasy of tiny Enid except that it remains a puzzle we know she experienced such ecstasy from we have the mezzotints done from the life by the mezzotint test Rex tent, which depict tiny Enid in great transports of joy. It is true as Rex tents SR dot tent pointed out that in many of these mezzotint tiny Enid could more accurately be described as chuckling or giggling in a childish way at slapstick scenes of pratfalls and Mark about rather than convulsed in spiritual ecstasy. But let us not forget the new one of the most well known of the mezzotint tiny Enid is shown so convulsed standing next to a clown, with unmistakable beads of sweat upon his brow, and great patches of perspiration visible under the arms of his clown costume. As he reaches up to flap his big clown gloved hands in some sort of funny business. Tiny Enid would never have laughed at a clown sweaty or not fair, she feared that she feared nothing else on earth ever. trawling through the various biographical documents which survive, I have found no indication that tiny Enid ever professed any religious impulses whatsoever, nor, for that matter, any more broadly spiritual leanings. Indeed, all accounts agree that she was a severely practical type of heroic infant never more essentially herself than when solving very concrete problems, usually involving the rescue of persons in peril. One thinks for example of tiny Enid abseiling down a crevasse to deliver a life saving polythene bag of nutritious bread pudding, to the half starved half frozen polar explorer, sub Blinky keys lip or digging a tunnel under the vindolanda Sea to reach a trio of extras from a Verner Hertzog film trapped in a subterranean pool rife with blind down below aquatic tentacle beings, each with thousands of razor sharp fangs and other swipeable appetites. One picture is tiny EDID taking a gift in their head with her big black boat. Perhaps we must ask, it was her.

Frank Key  18:59
Perhaps we must ask it was her reveries of such deeds which sent her into her great ecstasies. We ask that for the time being we cannot answer yes, with only great conviction. Not until much further work has been done to disentangle the hugely complicated legacy tiny Eenie left in her heroic infant tile wake.

Frank Key  19:41
I really must tell you about the time Dobson wangled himself a job on modern snipe magazine. It's a wonder that a pamphleteer with so shaky a grasp of Ornithology should seek employ on such a title. But Dobson had his reasons. Well, reason in the course of a conversation with a regular down at the cow and pins. Dobson learned that the name of the editor of modern snipe was an anagram of marigold true, and he chose to see in this some sort of mystical significance. 10 minutes later, he was hammering in a decidedly non mystical manner on the office door of gridlock code. The offices of modern snipe were at that time a suite of rooms on the top floor of a massive and efficient laundry building. Steam billowed from open windows and pipes and duct and an overpowering odor of boiling shirts and soap powder pervaded the neighborhood. Never the most observant of men. Dobson did not look up to see approach to see if any birds perched on the roof. But had he done so. He would have seen that a solitary Crow and not a snipe inside. We do not know how Dobson convinced grim Lord chose to take him all at once as a special rapporteur. But we do know that showed like the United Nations was given to bandying about the word rapporteur, rather than reporter there was no element of pretension in this chode came from a family of international diplomats. And I'd modeled the editorial structure of modern snipe on that of a mixture of huge transnational organizations, of which the UN was only one OPEC and Caf Conan SMERSH. Were in there too. He gave Dobson a blue helmet to wear and told him to go away and write something exciting about snipe. It is tempting here to veer off into a digression about Dobson and hats, a topic of endless fascination to some of us. But I fear things would get out of hand, particularly if I began to babble on about Dobson's homberg itself perhaps that evokes a world of allusions and references from James Mason to Procol harem. Better that we address such matters, another time and content ourselves. Now, with the image of the pamphleteer, trudging home along the towpath of the canal, a gleaming blue helmet atop his cranium and the brain inside that cranium throbbing with an incarnate tangle of cerebral gibberish, the dim center of which look the signal fact that Dobson knew nothing whatsoever about snipe marigold true was in the back garden training bees at the premise. When the pamphleteer arrived home, he tossed his blue helmet onto a hat peg with surprising aplomb, and sat down immediately at his pencil sharpened and with a fresh notebook open before him, he wrote. How fine a bird the snipe is, but first consider this. He who wishes for the cloth of heaven by find his hopes dashed and his garb but rags and tatters yet they're being not woven this for it is not the stamp of such a man that he looks out upon a Darkwing plane and pictures forth his wishes into a well, where one day. peonies will be spilled. At that point marigold two came in from the garden. She had one of her trained bees on her shoulder like a pirate miniature parrot. What on earth is that blue helmet hooked on to the hat peg? she asked. Dobson explained. marigold crew was aghast. I have nothing but admiration for your talents that Penny capsule pamphleteer. She announced as a trained beast, what shoulders, but the job of Special Rapporteur on modern snipe will prove your undoing Dobson and she swept dramatically out of the door and headed off in the Ranger Huberman department store to make inquiries about big baskets. Dobson returned to his notebook.

Frank Key  24:18
As your special rapporteur he scribbled it is my job to bring to readers new and unexpected perspectives on the travails of the modern snipe that much I shall do without fear. I once had custody of a clairvoyant pig, and in a very short time, it taught me many things. One lesson I recall was sweet indeed. At that time, I was fond of wearing my Homburg hat. It was a hat I wore when studying the hit the Hittites, and now I wore the hat to study the pig. One day, walking across a field with the pig in tow. I stopped to mop my brow and removed my hat and placed He's on a stone once out of the skies with a big beaked bird and perched upon my Homburg hat. Was it a snipe? It may have been, I looked at the bird and then I turned to look at the pig. And I realized with a start the pigs or neither me nor the bird, for being a clairvoyant pig, it could see only the future centuries hence, when where we stood was a darkling plane. And the spot where I laid my hat was a deep dark Well, at the bottom of which was a mountain of peonies, trucked in hope, by generation upon generation of disappointed and I further realized that all that hope was embodied in the form of the bird perched on my Homburg and I affirm that yes, it was a snipe. This last sentence was a complete lie, of course, as Dobson could affirm no such thing, but he was extremely pleased with his initial foray into the heady world of contemporary ornithological journalism. slapping the blue helmet back on its head. They stuffed the notebook into his satchel and crashed out of the door. On the canal towpath he met marigold true. She was carrying half a dozen bee baskets and the evening newspaper. Look at this, she said Dobson read the headline on the just published evening dachshund. He was not a man who often goggles but he goggles now snipe man's slain it read. Within the last hour Grimlock code had been shot dead by a sniper. And so ended Dobson's career as a birdie rapporteur.

No, I was. I was very inspired by that. I think I might try a few other of Gerard Manley Hopkins poems and see what I can come up with. Okay. Didn't see poplars. Yeah, yeah, I'll give that one a try. Anyway, that was fun. 10 Terrell 10 tails, by the way. Okay, that was the 10th tail.
