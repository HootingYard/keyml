Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air, otherwise known as a general air of decrepitude. I'm going to begin this week with a song. But as I can't sing, I'm just going to read the lyrics. And I'd like you to pay very careful attention and perhaps have a pen and paper handy because I might ask a series of questions. After I have recited the words of this song. I am the squeamish vagabond I swoon when I see blood, and I see blood plenty. As I trudge through slime and mud. As I roam from cops to Spinney I see corpses widely strewn of slaughtered traps and vagrants. I fear I'll join them soon. For I'm pursued by a violent foe, a fiend from the bottomless pond. I tremble and piddle in my pants on the squeamish vagabond.

As I said, I'm gonna ask a series of questions now about that song. Apparently it can be it can be sung to the tune of always crashing in the same car by David Bowie, although I've never actually heard it in that version. Anyway, I hope you have pen and paper and he memorized the, the the song from one reading so that it's called the squeamish vagabond. And is the first question how squeamish is the vagabond? I not very be about average, or see very squeamish. Question two. When the squeamish vagabond sees blood? What does he do? Question three. How much blood does the squeamish vagabond See? Does he see a? Hardly any? See? Plenty. See a I'm getting confused here. I hardly any. be plenty or see aplenty. Next question, what does the squeamish vagabond trudge through? And next, from where to where does the squeamish vagabond roam? For next question, with what are these places widely strewn? And the final question is, do you think the squeamish vagabond is a bit weedy?

It's quite a while since I've read any of my fk stories. In fact, it's quite a while since I've written any of my fk stories. Those of you who visited the heating yard website at hooting yard.org and found it completely quiet and non updated for weeks on end, fear not I am still alive and I will be writing some more. But anyway why here's one of the FAQ stories I wrote that I haven't read on the radio, excuse me on the radio as far as I can recall. I think Sorry, I think I have anyway. This is called the metamorphosis. As Greg or samza awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his back, and as he lifted his head slightly, he could see several tiny stick thin legs wriggling helplessly, he realized that at some point during the night, he had become some kind of beetle. His brain could not cope with this horror, and promptly shut down prompt, propelling him back into merciful unconsciousness. When Eventually, he woke from his stupor, he was shocked to discover that he had undergone a second transformation. He was no longer a Beatle. He was a Beatle. Somehow, he had now become Ringo Starr. Oh, more precisely, a perfect replica of Ringo Starr circa 1964. cautiously, he ran his hands over his hair, now become a mock top. He called out quietly for his mama, and heard our lagoo breus Liverpudlian accent, but my mom did not come. And in his despair, he picked up a pair of drumsticks which had appeared on his bedside table and backed himself on their head repeatedly and rhythmically with a characteristic fill, until once again, he lost consciousness. There were more uneasy greens and when he awoke again, he discovered he had undergone a third transformation. Now he had become an entirely new being. Outwardly indeed, inwardly. He was exactly the same as he had been the previous day, no longer a beetle or a beetle. But it was clear to him as evil that platter bed and plunged his head into a bucket of ice water, and shuffled into the kitchen for breakfast of drugged eels and reconstituted marmalade, and turned on the radio gram to listen to an early morning concert of argumentative German improvised racket, that something has changed something decisive and irreversible. But what neither mama nor papaya nor his young sister sofonisba gave any indication that he was in any way different. But then they barely noticed his presence at all, as they sat at the kitchen table, stuffing their gobs with cornflakes and hard boiled eggs in jelly. So concentrated were they on their munching and crunching that they did not even hear the frankly, god awful Dean from the radio gram. He wanted a sorry, he decided that the simplest way to work out what had happened to him would be to go about his usual routine, but to monitor himself. So he spent a profitable three or four hours, faffing about with the inner workings of his wristwatch. When he was done, it would not only tell what time, but it would keep a continuous track on the state of his soul and his vitals. If all with all his tweaking are correct, there at nightfall, when the day was done, his wristwatch would spit out a printed report with handy bullet points. The next day, he could pass this to a consultant for analysis. The difficulty would be to find a competent analyst. He did not require the services of a brain quack. But if someone trained in such fields as ornithology, geology, origami athletics, Travis work and rustic wisdom. If necessary, he would have to consult separate experts and then correlate their findings.

It was going to be an uphill struggle. Fortunately, Greg or Santa was no stranger to uphill struggles. Excuse me. Fortunately, Greg or Sandra was no stranger to uphill struggles. For the chalet where he lived with his mama and papaya and Sister sofonisba was at the foot of an important mountain every day. He had Had to clamber across the screen and up treacherous snow covered slopes to get to the newsagent. That was the first part of his routine. He purchased a copy of the daily Voodoo Dolly and a pint of warm untreated goatee milk, some toppings, and then he climbed ever further up the mountainside, panting until he reached his other chalet. He had always thought it best to have two chalets, one in which to sleep and ablute and eat breakfast, and another as a bolthole away from his family, in which he could wipe away the days staring out of the window that snow and sky and the various types of birds which flit and swoop in that sky. But on this day, he was only part of the way across the screen. When these head became filled with uncertainty and doubt. His legs were like jelly. on impulse, he turned back back to the family chalet, and he unlatch the door and slammed it shut behind him and collapsed on the carpet, across which he could see a beetle scary, an insect that is not ringgo. He lay on the floor wondering if the method if the news agent would be alarmed by his unaccustomed absence. And by the unsold copy of The Daily Voodoo Dolly. Would the news agent call the helicopter police? Would they come in search of him sweeping across the sky just like the birds, unlike the birds would by come scrambling down on rope ladders and kick in this shallow windows and taser him and hoist him up into the chopper and ferry him across the important mountains to a sinister compound. Would he be dragged to a cellar and tied to a chair and interrogated under Klieg lights? Would they mistake him for Ringo Starr? Would he be forced to sing octopuses garden? Or would they demand that he tell them tales of Thomas the Tank Engine? All these and other panicky questions throbbed in his brain pans, until he remembered that he was not ringgo he was neither a beetle nor a beetle. But What in the name of St. Spivak had he become, he got up from the carpet and went to the cupboard and took out a hammer and nails and planks and barricaded himself into the chalet. My Ma and Pa and sofonisba were out. attending an all day archery tournament in a nearby village is barricading and blotted out the daylight. So he deployed an array of blubber candles here and there on sideboards and mantel pieces and tabletops and counters. He gazed at the flames one by one, and pondered how curious it was that this light was produced by what was once the innards of that mighty sea beast, the whale. He asked himself with his own innards might in some future dispensation shed light upon the world. With that to be his destiny, as a new kind of being in his transformed state. hours passed with no hint of police helicopters, and one by one, the blubber candle was spotted and gathered out and he was left in darkness, rather than shedding light, then was his fate to become some kind of nocturnal being, like an owl or a bat. He rummaged through the looks of memory to try to recall what he had learned of the bat and the owl, through years upon years of study. He remembered little safer sounds of squeak and hoot, and that both bat and owl have the gift of flight. Could he now in his transformation fly, he flapped his arms, testing the air and discovered that yes, he could indeed fly. He rose so fast that he crashed right through the skylight in the chalet ceiling.

Now he was up in the cold, moonlit air, wheeling and swooping, a human styling. Now, it so happened that down below on the path from the village, his parents and his sister were returning from the archery tournament. Looking up at the moon, they were starting to see so strange and airborne being let's spell that highly unusual flying creature said Mama, we can sell the corpse to a museum and make a tidy sum. We will Be able to pay for Gregor to be put in a Mercy Home for the feckless and bewildered and the three of them each took their bows and arrows and shot him out of the sky. He plummeted to Earth their feet thrice pierced, and stone dead. And they saw that it was Gregor Crikey said Mama, we've bollocks things up good and proper. As soon as the helicopter police find out what we've done, we'll be in hot water and no mistake. There's only one thing for it. We'll have to flee all three of us. If we turn around now and go back to the village, we should be just in time to catch the night train to that dilapidated seaside resort 100 miles away. There is an unseemly hotel there, where we can hold up until this kerfuffle blows over all for the rest of our lives, depending on the personality of the coppers that go by made it to the railway station with seconds to spare, first dumping their bows and arrows in a skip next to the signal box as the night train chugged out towards the seaside, they sat in their carriage stuffing their gobs with a supper of lemon meringue pie and boiled liver. And it was like a confirmation of their new dreams and excellent intentions, that at the end of their journey, their daughter sprang to her feet first and stretched her young body.

this is a piece called naming the fruit when the panel Mac for the final. Okay, I'll start again. When the panel met for the final time to sign off on their deliberations of the previous six sessions. It was brought to their attention that they had completely forgotten to name one of the fruit. I have here a Punnett of the fruit, said the second secretary. It has somehow escaped the panel's attention here to four there was a hubbub of consternation.

Frank Key  18:36
There was a hubbub of consternation, which is a very different thing to have a hubbub such as the hubbub of outrage, or the hubbub of rapidly donned camouflage jackets. hubbub is of all kidneys, however, diminish eventually. And when this one did, one among the panel who happened to be wearing an unnecessary camouflage jacket said, let's let's take a closer look at that palette. Would it not be better to look closely at the unnamed fruit contained in the palate, rather than at the palate itself. These words were spoken by a panel member who had been conspicuously silent ever since the first session when he had pulled out of the bag metaphorically the word Clementine to denote the Clementine and of which he then pulled out, one of which he then pulled out of a paper bag literally. Saved heads nodding in agreement, the panel members gave their and diluted attention to the items of fruit in the Punnett after some while one Arthur's fellows have we already made use of the word grape. We have but you are Clearly thinking this fruit requires a one syllable name. Indeed, On what grounds? I'll just look at it. Look at them in that palette. I'm sorry to sound so exasperated, but only adult or halfway would dub that fruit with a multi syllabic name cries out for something simple and short and blunt. The Passion of this outburst convinced the other panel members of its general truth. Passion need not always denote the truth of course, most often it can lead to all sorts of human error, particularly when it crosses the line into hysteria. Consider the example of masked called ministers with their placards. It is ashamed, said Arpad, the senior member of the panel that we have already registered passionfruit as a fruit name. On that point, said his immediate table neighbor. Can anybody explain why in some cases, we have used the word fruit as part of the fruit name? I'm thinking of the pattern fruit and the kiwi fruit, which you will recall we named that Thursday session. Why are we laboring the word fruit when it is blindingly obvious that the thing denoted is a fruit. before anybody could answer this reasonable query, there was an interruption from the radio transmitter. That was lovely strains of Xavi a to gatt and his orchestra gave way to a gravelly, gravely voice newsflash, there have been a bitten storm over olma Xavi a coup got resumed. How about uhm, piped up bins, a pallet of ohms it is tempting said are bad, but I have two objections. First, the fruit may thereby become too closely associated with the city in Barton rittenberg, where this bitton storm has just occurred. Second, I think we're all agreed that most fruit names benefit from beginning with consonant not all, but most. The panel then worked through the alphabet. appending consonants to own after a vote they agreed unanimously to pull. When the second Secretary came to write the new fruit name in the register. He was momentarily distracted by the cry of a bitten booming from the marshes and then to the man's, and he accidentally transposed the middle letters of the word. And hence the plum

loop node the carrier Oh, is he dead? Then? My fruit bowl all emptied. He carried my fruit loop node in his manly muscular hands, plums in punnets and Horbury is in Hopkins. The sun battered him as he sashayed from orchard to pier to my kiosk, this man oh fruit, Jesuit tickle in his Pharaoh brown beanstalk bitterness, a man of few words and those the names of fruits names he made up embroidered spat out like plum stones, chewed like nettles Oh loop node forsaken by a God whose Mercurial recklessness? Those divine spasms came twitching in rags and schmatta pips haunted him loop node lodged in his pocket crannies scattered in his locks, curly black and slathered in ink. slathered in black, do not taunt him now in his grave on his OPERS worm lunch bird roost. They named a pond for him, no fish thrive with it. And yet in memory of loop node, I take my paper bag of backings there each March morning sudden by rain and swamped by yearning crumbs for next sag galoshes. Splash

We've got five minutes to go or there abouts, which is not time enough to read anything of any great length. So I've got a couple of other things to mention. I ought to mention, I did say that the heating yard website haven't been updated for weeks. The other thing is that that pestilential bit of hackery, that meant that if you tried to go to hooting yardie was sent to some evil web. Darkness has still not been eradicated. We can't seem to get rid of it. But I found that if you try to go to hooting art a second time, you usually get there without mishap. But I will try and do something about that. So there's that. Another thing is neck I mentioned at the beginning of the show that the the new title of the show is a general error of decrepitude. So I also note that next week, I'm off to the hospital yet again, to have my eyes dealt with by eye doctors. Very good, very good guy off to and, but I'll be there next week, so I won't be here, because I'll be lying possibly on my back with one of those clamps clamping my eye open so I can't shut it while an eye doctor injects a needle directly into my eyeball for the umpteenth time. That's pretty exciting, too. Anyway, we're nearly at the end of the show. And but I do think I will tell you that I read recently, a book by Maliki Whitaker called and so did I published in 1939. Maliki worked with a with a woman of the Norwalk, meaning the north of England. And she wrote quite a lot of short stories. And and so did I is kind of a it's not an it's not an autobiography, but it's like a journal. And it has many great observations in it. And I think this one particularly appealed to me, where she writes tea, like death is a great leveler reminds me a bit of what Thomas de Quincey said that tea was the chosen drink of intellectuals. So not a it's both the chosen drink of intellectuals and a great leveler. So next time you have a cup of tea, which I assume will be within the next 30 seconds will be my case that you can you can bear that in mind. I'm going to stop babbling now. do go to the website, buy some books, or send me some money that always comes in useful. And as I said, I won't be here next week. But assuming I can still see. Excuse me, I'll be back the week after Bye bye.
