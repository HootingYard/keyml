Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Half an hour of prose as usual. Wonderful and mighty beings. Oh, there's the everlasting hills destitute of mortal sympathy, cold and inscrutable handing the two edge javelins of frost and magnetism and served by all the unknown polar agencies with their phantasmagoria they shot and hemmed me in and watched me ride like a worm. Okay, that's this week's quiz. That was either what I did this morning, or a quotation from Harriet prescot spofford book, The Moonstone mass. I'll leave you to guess which. Sunday on Sunday is the feast day of St. mungo. You want to know that St. mangos Mother tenue was thrown from the top of trap rain law a large Hill outside Edinburgh by her father loss. Because she survived the plunge. It was thought she was a witch. So she was cast adrift in a coracle. Best thing to be cast adrift in really fetching up at St. surfs religious establishment on Cole Ross. She gave birth to mango on the beach. This all happened in the sixth century. Mango had a bell. He is a very important saint to Robbins, St. Surf had a pet Robin, which was slaughtered by mangoes jealous classmates, who hoped to pin the blame on him. But mango restored the bird to life. Later on, he swapped his pastoral stave with St. Columba. There is a special mass for St. mungo dating from the 13th century, which has been printed by the balandis. The balandis are an association of ecclesiastical scholars engaged in editing the actor sanctorum a great hagiographical collection began during the first years of the 17th century and continued to draw our own day. The work was conceived by Heribert Roz Wade 1569 to 1629 under the title fasti sanctorum. quorum vettai belgic is biblio tech is manuscript ti. He gave in a little volume published by the planting press at Antwerp and alphabetical list of the names of the saints whose acts had been either found by him or called his attention in old manuscript collections. This list filled 50 pages, the preparatory notice in which he indicates the character and arrangement of his work takes up a further 14. Finally, the work contains an appendix of 26 pages containing the unpublished act of the passion of the holy site illicium martyrs, fast acres probis and Andronicus but not mango, who was not in any case, our holy Silas he and Martha

Heribert Roz wider planned supplementary volumes, which would include the authors of the lives the sufferings of the martyrs. The images of the saints, liturgical rites and customs mentioned in hagiographical documents, profane customs to which allusions had been made questions of chronology, names of places encountered in those same documents, barbarous or obscure terms which might puzzle the readers and tables showing the names of the saints whose lives had been published in the preceding volumes, the same names followed by notes indicating the place of the st birth, his station in life, his title to sanctity, the time and place in which he had lived, and the author of his life, the state of life of the various saints, religious priest, Virgin widow, etc. Their position in the church, apostle, Bishop, Abbot, etc. The nomenclature of the saints according to the country's made illustrious by their birth, at postulate, sojourn burial, nomenclature of the places in which they are honored with a special cult enumeration of the maladies for the cure of which they are especially invoked, the professions placed under their patronage, the proper names of persons and places encountered in the published lives, the passages of Holy Scripture, they're explained points which may be of use in religious country properties. Those are applicable in the teaching of Christian doctrine, a general table of words and things in alphabetical order, and others still added to the author, if anything of importance presents itself, of which our readers may give us an idea. As I said, Heribert rose, white only planned the supplementary volumes, so it looks as if it's going to be down to me to actually write them. Anyway, this is such an important topic that we'll return to a later date. Meanwhile, you can commit to memory, the little rhyme associated with St. mungo. and recite it on Sunday on his feast day. The tree that never grew, the bird that never flew the fish that never swam, the bell that never rang.

I'm gonna proceed The next piece with a quotation as well. They're not the quotation isn't relevant to the piece, but I like it. It's from the strange life of Nikola Tesla, by Nikola Tesla. On my return to the city that night, I felt a positive sensation, my brain had caught fire. It was a light as though a small Sun was located in it, and I passed the whole night night applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally, the flashes diminished in frequency and force, but it took more than three weeks before they wholly subsided. These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, but they're no longer exciting. In a cabin on a ship in a cabin on a ship steaming into harbor were two glum men know the ship sorry, the ship was steaming away from the harbor or port, a port whose name ended in dam Do not try to guess which port I refer to feel brain will become designed by the effort. And if you were an animation, little tweeting birds would circle around your head. Such would be your befuddlement. I know whereof I speak so trust me. This ship now the HMS important and grandiose flying many flags had gravitas. If we can ascribe gravitas to a ship, and as it steamed out of the port of dam, it had many many flags flying. Some of the flags were blue, a civilian blue, like the best skies on the most gorgeous summer days. If you stare at the bright sky on such a day for long enough, you will see that the air is teeming with spirits, as multitudinous as flakes in a snowstorm, according to a French person called Leo suaveness. And look, many of the flags flying from the ship. Those that are blue and those of other shades have pictures of angels on them. You may scan the flags as carefully as you wish, but you will not find a skull and crossbones hidden among them. For this is not a pirate ship is or was. I fear I veered from the past tense to the present without explanation, unless I'm careful, which will hurdle into the future and what is intended to be a sober piece of reportage will become science fiction. And you will turn off your radio with a harrumph of displeasure fit if I know you well, dear listener, you would rather have me tell you of that which is prosaic and mundane than be titillated with intergalactic space rockets, captained by alien beings called thorgan zapping X ray beams that inexplicable foes whose very geometry is an earthly Once, when I had time to spare, and the ship was still in port, I tried to count all those magnificent flags, and found that I could never arrive at an exact number. Perhaps there were sailors aboard hoisting and lowering them so rapidly that I did not see I did not have a pair of binoculars in those days. Indeed, I still don't for what would you what use would they be to a cyclops like me who's left I was damaged during the Munich air disaster. I'll tell you about that another time. Now, picture that ship with its serried blue flags and its innumerable angels steaming out of the port of dam and two glum men in a cabin below decks. The door is closed. The cabin has two portholes and they are of frosted glass for no particular reason. One of the gloomy man is sitting on an upper bunk dangling his spindly legs over the side. When he used to laugh years ago, he sounded like a bronco horse. And indeed, he suffered terribly from bronchitis and often on his daily rounds, walked past a field in which a tremendous number of horses were put out a fallow. If that is the correct word. I don't think it is but I'll let it stand. I mean, that kind of mood. But that was long ago. Now glum and emaciated. He sits on the bunk in a cabin of the ship of many flags and clears his throat. He is about to introduce himself to the other miserable man in the cabin, who has just come in slamming the door behind him.

This second man is wearing a top his pulsating cranium, a Dippy hat. For the last few hours. He has been thinking thinking so damn hard about ducks for that sort of man he is. He wants to complete a catalogue of duck markings duck behavior and duck habitat, but has been unable to work on it for a while as he has sprained his wrist and cannot write. This accounts for his glumness and also for his sling. The sprain occurred when he was trying to unscrew the jam lid from a jar of hoody Maruti paste. We might ask at this point, the cause of the other man's gloom the man on the bunk who used to laugh like a horse Long, long ago. Sadly, his interior life is a thing of mystery to me at any rate, from bulkhead to poop hatch, instructions are being shouted back and forth by the ship's crew. The Mighty Sun is gleaming bronze flags are flying and the sky is alive with orcs and turns and guillemots below decks in the gloomy cabin. The two men reluctantly greet each other. This was the historic moment when I met Dobson.

leap forward some years to get our next glimpse of Blodgett in a bog. We find Blodgett, we steal upon him when he does not expect us. He is floundering in the bog, a clumsy giant, one of us says, Blodgett, you have modern your beard. Blodgett feigns not to hear. He paths and grunts as he splutters bits of dried mud fall out of his beard. How long have you been in that? bog Blodgett, we ask in unison. Now Blodgett scowls, his spectacles are mysteriously a gleam in spite of the muck in which he wallows. He does not reply, with great groans. He hoists himself almost his feet before falling back into the bog with a mighty splash. Now there is some mud on his spectacles to Blodgett Blodgett. There is mud on your spectacles, we sing to a little tune we have devised for such an occasion. This causes Blodgett to growl he sounds like a hog. we toss him one end of a rope. Desmond ties the other end of the rope to the trunk of a nearby Sycamore. Blodgett pull yourself out of the bog using the rope, we cry. None of us can remember the rest of our tune. Blodgett hat has fallen off his head. He tries to wipe the mud off his spectacles with a fat finger, but only makes us smudge. Clouds scattered across the sky. They are black and bring rain. Poor Blodgett flops around in the bog. He does not use our rope, for he does not know we are there. No matter how loud we shout his name, he cannot hear us. Even his spectacle. Even if his spectacles were not smudged, he could not see us. We are always here at the edge of the bog through days and nights in every season of the year. But we are tiny children, and we are ghosts.

Two things now one about Pope Pius the 12th and one about an shaytans and my friend, Max desharnais sent me an interesting letter about Eugenio pacelli. Who was Pope Pius the 12th. max wrote, I recommend john Caldwell's fascinating. Hitler's Pope, The Secret History of Pius the 12th. Senor Petrelli seems to have been a humble chap, he ordered that anyone in the clergy who was on the other end of the telephone to him should kneel throughout the conversation. And the gardeners in his private garden, were instructed to hide in the bushes as he went past so he wouldn't have to look at them. Having Of course sworn an oath of poverty, he drove around in a huge limousine with no chairs in the back, just a large throne. He also seems to have regarded himself as an expert on all manner of subject. Max then quotes from the book itself. If he showed signs of grandiosity, it was in his tendency to expatiate on an ever expanding range of topics, so numerous and so beyond his competence were these specialized talks or allocations that the practice seemed symptomatic of ripening delusions of omniscience. The Pope lectured visiting groups on subjects such as dentistry, gymnastics, gynecology, aeronautics, cinematography, psychology, psychiatry, agriculture, plastic surgery, and the art of news casting. A visitor to his study once remarked on the piles of fat manuals around his desk. Petrelli responded that he was preparing a talk on gas central heating. When TS Eliot, arguably the leading English language poet and literary critic of his day came to the Vatican for a private audience in 1948. HP actually delivered him a lecture on literature. I think I'd like to hear a lecture on gas central heating delivered by the Pope Benedict can do that. All of which makes me realize that Anthony Burgess would have made a really great Pope I think. Anyway, as I said, from past the 12th on to entrate ons. In today's lecture, we shall attend to both entrate ons and trade on stubs in their quiddity and morass. Flora pad wrote that in the collapsing is the Atlantic shore, and those words hidden away in a footnote yet ring down the ages. I gasp you chloral new gasp he she or it gasps much gasping and not a little panting we gasp you plural gasp they gasp This is what happens when we try to extricate Flora pad from the entangled porcupine of the past. And it's fair to say that it must be so when we take account of the duty imposed upon us by our collegiate pan Jan drums to sequester what is mad from what is made that which is made in the brain or with the counted limbs. consider for a moment a wild hog irksome as it can be to propel one's mind towards the twinkling stars of the incumbency of handmade beings. It must be done with grace and an attunement to planetary winds. Flora Pat himself says in conditions with slots being as grid doing as a pearl and it is well to remember that in the teeth of reverie, let us recollect the technique, the bath of tin and fumigator results the shadowing of the tapped and the experimental conquest of untenable tensors three zinc, three tungsten five copper, each tensor placed over a retort and the fires belching grandly hearing the daring of monsters. Do not forget the bitumen as people have made necklaces from bones, teeth and feathers, so today we must devise new forms in our underground laboratories.

You may recall a shock that greeted proof copies of tema, rare the propulsion that flimsy pamphlet so widely read by movers and shakers in hock to those who gather cowslips, the resonance of tumbling hobbyhorses etched on a pain unjoined dots fantastic sport of mazeppa Duluth and Banyan to nine but three. From sand comes not sand from the planet metal affinities the law of the BB and the barbell west or east hands across some mental ocean tied in time and tucked in folds that mimic the integuments of a grocer dispensation. This is what we work for. This is why we work. That is why one by one we see each pinprick star brilliant in the ether, our horses unsaddled our buckles valliant our dust no longer dust.

They call him mctavish. They did indeed call him mctavish but mctavish was not his name. His name was Krista Berg. And as well as being the village wrestler, he was the village knits man. The village had had an its man ever since the invention of true knitting, which is to say around 1100 ad if we accept that the first historical example of knitting as we know it today, as opposed to other kinds of textile work is a pair of patterned cotton socks found in Egypt. This is not the place to investigate how the craft traveled from the Nile Delta via the English clergyman William Lee's knitting machine of 1589 to the godforsaken rustic stylage Depo, where Krista Berg lived all those centuries later, there was a village knits woman too, but by a curious tradition, it was forbidden for the to ever to meet. Because it was a very small village. Extraordinary precautions were taken involving fences, barricades, false walls, lanes blocked by herds of restless barnyard animals, clocks round misleadingly. undelivered telegrams pit dog and camouflaged and in extremists, Eldridge tampering with the continuum by bat Of course, I mean the space time continuum, but I was trying to save my words as carefully as Christopher who saved his wall. The village knits man always used Norwegian wool. Although the village was not a Norwegian one. Happy as I would be to report that it was in Finland near the Cavalli and holiday resort of bomba, I have to admit that it was not even in Scandinavia. Be that as it may, Christa Berg, was careful with his wall. He was also careful with his food for poisoning was rife in this village. There had been many problems with ergot before the war, and afterwards, and there were many sociopath at large. Fortunately, they were easily identified because by decree they were all made to wear chaps Spats and boxy jackets, and to live in a purple tent near a clump of gasworks. Careful with wool and careful with food. Christopher hug or mctavish, as they call him, was nevertheless a sitting duck when attacked by a ghoul with a funnel.

Here's a piece called Jarvis and carpet. The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis, the bird scientist. Look you young tyke, there is a bird on the bell tower, he said to his pneumonia. racked asst Kubot who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips. Jarvis pointed at the bird expecting cabbage to look but the spindly youth was distracted by a passing, Pan technicon all like Creta with pots and pans. It was the neighborhood windy man on his rounds. Jarvis hated the windy man phase clattering pots and pans made a den that often frightened birds so that they flew away into the blue majestic skies, just as the ornithologist was creeping close with his tweezers and bird beaker. The windy man, on the other hand, was passionately in love with Jarvis and had been ever since he had seen the bird scientists standing on a date making a bird related proclamation years ago, for all the world like an Apollonian God. Also he seemed to the windy man. But the windy man was shy and did not speak of His love. So he pined and felt pangs and was in torment. Cabbage knew nothing of what is related in that previous paragraph. By chance, a snapshot exists at this precise moment. It was taken by a passing camera bath whose fancy had been taken by a pirouetting mechanical and new guard vending machine, or pink and gleaming. There it is to the left in the black and white photograph in front of the bell tower. To the right in the foreground, we see the back of Cabot's head next to a furious looking Jarvis. partially obscured. behind them is the windy man's pan technical on which some of the clattering pots and pans are visible. Sadly, the windy man's face is blurred by a smudge or a cloud of gnats, or a freakish fulgens of mist and gas. It could be any of those things. In framing his photo, the enthusiasts did not include the upper part of the bell tower. So we do not know what kind of bird Jarvis was pointing at, nor whether it was a bird at all, or just perhaps a flattering black napkin born aloft on a gentle Summer Breeze given avian form through the power of Java's his unquenchable imagination, oddly enough, ever after he insisted it was a trumpeter swan. And that's nearly the end of this week's hooting out on the air. I think I'd like to read you a couple more quotations from other writers, particularly the great great Jimmy Godard, author of the of the pamphlet cosmic friends, and found a member of the staff fellowship. Here's a passage from Jim he got out there was an interesting communication at of all places saulsbury railway station in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone to help my condition. having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in other tongues, other flesh by George humped Williamson with their complicated circuits, I felt unqualified to build one. The answer wrapped back, just build a simple cone of copper. That's not beyond you, is it? I sat up with a start. Surely space people would not talk like that. But it jerked me out of my self pity. And I began a regular daily use of a cone, which my father made from a piece of scrap sheet copper. Slightly disappointing that after being after being scolded by space people, Jimmy good got his dad to make the copper cone for him. Very remiss. That's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it and found it very instructive as ever. Don't forget some mangoes day on Sunday, and I'll be back with you next week. Bye bye.
