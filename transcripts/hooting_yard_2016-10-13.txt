Good evening, this is resonance fm.com. Last week, the first half of a pamphlet from 1989. That's a long time ago, that's 27 years ago. I'm gonna read you the second half chapters five to eight. today. I think we've got time for the whole lot. But in case we haven't I better press on without further ado. So this is a house of terps chapter five. Open square brackets are extracted from a bucket of wisdom by mod s firebrand. The text itself explanatory, but it's worth taking the opportunity here to retail a brief anecdote concerning Dr. firebrand, which is unpublished elsewhere. It is said that during her first year as a lecturer at the University of Van globs of land, Dr. firebrand was piloting her biplane over the icy waist when she was forced to crash landing pretty sticky circumstances. marooned in this frozen hell, her chances of survival was slight. For provisions, she had only a packet of boiled sweets and a flask of sour cocoa results from as ever, the plucky ethnologist injected her faithful Husky, with a dose of helium. Not so much today exploded, but enough for it to float balloon like over the ice until it came into mind on the ramshackle tin roof of the university volleyball court. From there, it scampered hot foot to the Medical Center, where it interrupted a three way wrestling match between Dr. Build dr grudge and Dr. strabismus. The contest had been occasioned by the use of some choice language of the Gotha by Dr. Build during an astounding and dangerous operation to remove the inflamed upper frac from an elderly boy in of the van gloves land pole vaulting club. The patient bore an uncanny resemblance to the film actor bill purge. He of the brilliant team blocks and puckish errs, Dr. bilge remonstrated with the patient screeching and breastfeeding and was bundled out of the operating theater by his colleagues. Excuse me, I've got a cold by his colleagues, who, leaving the inflamed upper fractured throbbing venomously on a side trolley, proceeded to bash Dr. Build about the head with a variety of surgical equipment. So it was that a fortnight later, Dr. Build sought satisfaction by challenging his tormentors to a three way wrestling match, announcing that he would fight the pair of them simultaneously. He was on the brink of a veritable pounding when Dr. firebrands trusty pooch rags, howling like a demon entered the fray and brought the fight to an immediate halt. Dealing build your few hefty blows to the head grant john strabismus hurried over to be hurried over to the feisty hound and expelling the last remnants of helium from its body. Scan the message scrawled on a yogurt carton tied around its neck, shoving a dish of bone meal under the dog's snout. The two doctors scrambled their airplane and flew off to rescue dr firebrand, making use of the map reference points given in the school message by found her half buried in the snow, sucking one of her boiled sweets and monstrously unperturbed

biter swooping in over the campus, there mercy dash completed, the airborne doctors were amazed to see doctor build standing on the roof of the university coolit warehouse to the teeth with a blunderbuss and a sack of hay. Whatever demented scheme he had in mind was swiftly a noun. However, all of a sudden, an enormous Anvil plummeted from the heavens crashing straight onto his skull and propelling him through the roof and through the top most layers of mountain of tulips. And so the expired mashed in among the vegetable. He had a dude since boyhood. The flower, but let us not dwell on his atrocious fight. All that calls itself human was hateful to him, we must proceed with the promised extract from Dr. firebrand, seminal potpourri, a bucket of wisdom.

I'm sorry that always coughing and those of you who remember the fast show will remember Bob Fleming played by Charlie Higson who did a lot of coughing. And I have to say I'm beginning to feel like Bob Fleming. I think it pertinent to note that I do have a screaming head cold, as does john Johnny seven, who is usually my engineer. But it's not Johnny, who's sitting opposite me today, because he is so sickly, he stayed at home, Mia has stepped into the breach to do the sound engineering. I was very kindly drip brought me a cup of water, which I may need, whether we're going to be able to finish House of tubs this week becomes a moot point. However, on here, I struggle into the studio, unlike Johnny, and I'm going to attempt to read it hang on. I'm going to attempt to read it and if I start coughing again, too much, we'll have to think of something else to do play some minor hits. Or maybe we could play music by the new winner of the Nobel Peace a Nobel Prize for Literature. Have you heard who that was? It was Bob Dylan. It wasn't me, which is a bit unfortunate. Maybe next year, the Swedish Academy will get around to me. But yeah, they gave the Nobel Prize for Literature to Bob Dylan. I read somewhere that Irvin Welch's some kind of irascible Scotsman who's written some books complained that it was basically a group of old hippies making the award but I think that's because we know that an irascible Scotsman like driving well she can't really write properly. We'll never win that prize.

It Britain only have in wells, you'll probably get his henchmen to set upon me now. Although I understand he lives in in blissful wealth in Chicago. I'm going to stop talking and cough a bit with the music app so you won't have to listen to my coughing and then we'll we will make an attempt to continue the show. Hold on.

Right I am going to try and continue now with chapter five of House of terps this is an extract from a bucket of wisdom by mod s firebrand and the name of that place was Hoon, and at that time Hoon was plagued by bears Sheldrake and enormous mouth like beings which emitted jet of gaseous yellow poison. The townsfolk were in a state of terror. All attempts to read Hoon of the beast, which preset it had met with failure. At summarization and 13 of the citizens declared that Hoon held no hope for them, and they packed up their belongings bade farewell to their neighbors, and left Hoon forever. Their names were recorded in a ledger by the town get Abigail nug or not need unfortunate Bridget Hargreaves the accident prone sorceress cry sawston Puck eel headed toper of ill repute, who tattooed the stigmata displayed by Father garbett during the last days of his trial, dragged up quill, a brain sick often ebbing Rutter the well known dribbling ventriloquist who's done these festooned with feathers became highly prized works of art, files fire, bone sedge and ignoble norseman Gamal McCray, the hateful xylophone maker whose parents took part in the utensil Frampton riots. Hieronymus adword a closeted whaling captain. In by vagabonds, a morbid yodeler not given to delivering is dirge like melodies from a top a prince of bones. Juniper wouldn't bury the gravel throated paracelsus of hooting yard caca as I go against me at rogue lip jacc, the frightening zookeeper mentioned by croc and his groundbreaking and integrates best theory and mulberry Zab, a lateral master quack, renowned phase homemade potions, foul smelling, unpalatable and have no medicinal use whatsoever. Their journey away from Hoon to a destination unknown was fraught with difficulties. In the first hundred days. They restrict and turn and turn about by au botulism climacell horas diphtheria emphysema fleabite the grip halitosis infestation jiggers, knotted Vickery leak plague, mumps, nosebleed, otitis, pooping, queasiness, rickets, scruffier, tuberculosis, all no fury variola run grunts, Zan tops here, yours and zinc poisoning. On the hundred and first day they were attacked by a swarm of Hornets on the hundred and second day they fell down a mighty crevasse. On the hundred and third day, they smelled a pig. On the hundred and fourth day, they discovered that they had no food left zygo a notorious glutton, had to sculpt the last bag of custard before dawn, sharpening their wooden sticks, like put him to death when the sun lays directly above their heads. in the wilderness, the 12 exiles of Hoon would surely have perished had they not stumbled upon an implausibly vast tract of pragmatic pushes. The pragmatic, is a stinking beige shrub, the leaves of which are nutritious, pleasing to the palate and stained the tongue blue. A small amount of pragmatic leaves say half an ounce is worth is enough to keep an adult alive for a week. The travelers harvested as much of the pragmatic as they could carry. On the 10,000th day they arrived at Arctic emboldened by the journey nog, oh Hargreaves and Park had cast aside all fear of balls and Sheldrake quill rata and sage also had what it takes.

so we will press on with chapter six of House of terps from 1989. But why ask Kirpan? Do you wear such an outlandish costume? To the innocent eye you appear like some misshapen beast spawned in the laboratory of a maniac. Yeah, here we sit in ridiculously comfortable armchairs, sipping glasses of port. I am bewildered. I can imagine how you feel, said Mordo Hargreaves. This sort of thing has happened before. Some 20 years ago, our little settlement had the pleasure to welcome another loan visitor. He was an unkempt, bubble bearded Professor with a passion for cocoa. He nearly dragged us dry. I remember, we had to replace all the spindles on the mulching engine while he was here. I found him very difficult to fathom. He was not a happy man. On the day we foisted the chieftainship upon him, he flew into a rage. He slobbered and stamped his feet. I took him into the Flamingo tent to calm him down, only for him to berate me and a series of extemporary verses sang in a grating wine. Mud had to be wedged into his mouth in order to silence him. Whoa, whoa, whoa. But since he met his end, we have had no more visitors and therefore no Clifton, your arrival among us is most welcome Slava Dan. Little did I know when I held myself after you enter that gaping pit mod, that I was entering a vast subterranean network of chambers, caverns and tunnels that a whole society existed beneath the frozen wastes. But now that I'm here, it seems perfectly reasonable that you should dub me your Clifton. After all, my scientific genius knows no bounds, I can only hope that your faith in me will be repaid. salobre dan, I don't think you understand your scientific abilities have nothing to do with your chieftainship The mere fact that you come from the outside worlds enough, any old harebrained get wandering aimlessly about the Arctic would have served as well. I don't mean to disparage your intellectual gifts. I simply don't care about them. Nor would you find anyone here who does. We need a stranger to become our chieftain in order to carry out a demented and violent ritual. You see 300 years ago, when our ancestors first settled here, their brains had been ravaged by their massive consumption of pragmatic leaves. As a result, whenever outsiders come among us, we install them as chieftain for stone them with plumage cake their hair with Garmin tauchen own ambergris des from them with a name chanting. praise them in a faintly mawkish manner. Have them asked to have them cascading jalopies over imaginary sand dunes and then put them to an unspeakably grisly death. Here have another glass of this ruinously expensive port. I don't understand. To be quite frank, I failed to see the connection between your ancestors eating too much shrubbery and your desire to act and what strikes me as a highly uncivilized manner. Hmm Funnily enough, the cocoa swilling cap said the very same thing. There simply wasn't the time to explain it to him though, I tried to give him a sort of crack course. With began with the basics. I showed him the valves of different ages attached to a block of wood and the tentacles, bright red set to love propelled with such vigor and promptitude the size of Aristotle's lanton. Then I explained explained how the vagrant of a light covering texture furnished with several arms attached to the mother stem, like a branch was intended as an outlet for the product of digestion. Every specimen of resplendent purple globular upended with pierced with holes milman cask were invoked the oblique notch on the tooth with large, thick, internally dilated, folded and with a semi circular horned operculum. Broken shells from broken seas, filaments, substances longitudinally Sal kated the edges of the base, chlorinated absorbent burned portion by portion, but it was no use. Before we could progress to the more complicated material. Our chieftain was given his last cup of cocoa printed and printed his finery, and had his head boiled, I can still hear his howls of agony ringing in my ears, or rather, ear.

But this is preposterous. What makes you think I will submit to this barbarism it is written to aberdein on the day of curly mush, the ritual must take place. And so it shall, until that day, you are free to do as you wish, it is only forbidden that you should leave here not that you would ever be able to discover an exit. Why not? Because there is no exit. Crikey.

So, because of the coughing, Farago is the time to read all of the terms. But that's exciting because it means that the last two chapters will be next week. So that's something for you to look forward to chapter seven and eight the the new model of this exciting tale published in 1989. Coming up next week, you may wish to know if you look for House of terps on eBay. I have known copies of this to go for about 200 For 250 pounds, so if you have a copy and you want to sell it, you can probably ask that much money for it. But you wouldn't want to sell it, would you? I mean, you just wouldn't want to keep it forever. And so I'm not actually going to read anymore. This week, we're gonna come to the end of the show, because I'm going to probably collapse in a whimpering heap and moan horribly. I send, send my best wishes to Johnny seven and hope he gets well soon. And anyone else who's listening who's sick in any way. I'll pray for you. That's the kind of thing that people say on the radio, I don't know. But anyway. Any any sick people listening to the show? Get well soon. And I hope that the various bits of babbling have been that you're able to feel a little bit better than you were about half an hour ago. Although of course, if you keep resonance on you should be okay. We've got some kind of excitement happening now with someone attempting to get into the building. And and saying the gates not working. So I may or might run out and do that or not? Not? Yeah, I'll just keep talking. I can keep talking. And I'll guess that's signaling going on. But let me explain what's happening here. I've got a cold, so I haven't been able to do the show properly. Johnny seven, the usual sound engineer is so sick, he's at home. And Mia, who's another tireless resonance volunteer, has stepped in for john, and has done wonders doing this show, particularly with me kind of crumpled and record. But now all of a sudden, this there's this flashing lights and a thing saying that the door won't open, the gate won't open. So me I ran out to open the gate and has run back in and the whole thing is so exciting. It's probably less exciting for you at home, but I'm trying to paint a picture of the kind of everyday excitement that happens that resonance. And I you know, I've just managed to speak for about five minutes, even though what I want to really do is curl up in a ball and die. I'm going to go away and cough a bit now. And that's the end of hooting out for this week. And next week we'll have chapters seven and eight of House of terps Bye bye
