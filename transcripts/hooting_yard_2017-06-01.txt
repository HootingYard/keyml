Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM, or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. Now in its 13th, year of, of broadcasting. And before begin before getting on with this week's show, I would just like to echo what john said about the illegality of listening to the show on a mobile phone. I don't know if any of you are doing so. But you're not allowed to. In fact, if you have a mobile phone, the best thing to do. If you own a mobile phone and use one on a regular basis, the best thing to do is to go to Scotland, you might need to if you don't live in Scotland already, you might need to get a train or go by car. Go to Scotland go to the near go to the deepest. nearest law. I have many locks in Scotland large expanse of water, and standing on the banks of the law. Whoa, your mobile phone into it and watch it sink and then walk away and go home. You will be a much better person as a result. Anyway, that's my advice, or is it just orders? orders? Yes. It's a diktat. Are you case like the Russians as you say issue? So I hope you've done that or about to do that. And meanwhile, I'll get on with the show. And I thought it's quite a while since I've read anything to you from the internationally acclaimed non bestseller. Mr. Keyes, shorter, potted brief, brief lives. published last year or the year before, I can't remember anyway, publish the year before I think. And unexpectedly it didn't sell in vast quantities, but it's still available. You might find it in a bookshop. Or you can always buy online from one of the big, big internet retailers. Published by constable books, Mr. Keith shorter, potted, brief, brief lives, and here are a few of them. Just to keep you entertained. Let's begin at the end. Florence zu gun rumanian spirit medium 19 born 1913 don't know when she died. Eleonora Zhu GM was known as the spook of typer. She had an invisible familia named Draco, who bit and scratched her butt could be propitiated with gifts of chocolate cake. She became a popular phenomenon in London and Vienna, until her supernatural powers vanished when she hit puberty. Later, she became a hairdresser. Emil Zappa tech zetec check long distance runner 1922 to 2000 xattr Peck was one of the 20th century's greatest long distance runners, described by journalists variously as, like a man who had been stabbed in the heart, as if his next step would be his last and definitively like a man wrestling with an octopus on a conveyor belt. And Asif Ali Zardari, the Pakistani politician born 1955. When serving as president of Pakistan between 2008 and 2013, Zardari had a Black Goat ritually slaughtered at his house in his allameh bed every day. Denying newspaper reports that the goat sacrifice was designed to protect against black magic and the evil eye. His official spokesman explained that the practice gave pleasure to God and then anytime case, goats were not killed every day, just quite often.

And let's just have one more brief brief life. This is the brief life of Peter Wolf, Irish chemist and alchemists. 1727 to 1803. Wolf bats w. ULF. he once was described as the last alchemists. His rooms in London were crammed with scientific operators, including retorts, crucibles and Olympics, together with mysterious boxes, packages and crates. He took his breakfast at four o'clock in the morning, and occasionally invited friends to join him, though they had to use a secret signal to gain admittance. Whenever he felt ill, his remedy was to travel in the mail coach from London to Edinburgh, and back again.

This is a story called dim wit under the trellis. That morning, I strode out into the grounds of my country pile whacking my steak lupins crocus's and in one instance, as a swan passing between one pond and another, following the path towards the Haha, I was startled to spot a dem with standing under the Travis. He was a still grubby plump dimwit. I asked him what is the name of all the angels in heaven he was doing and the grounds of my pile? His answer was incoherent. Perhaps because he was a foreign dimwit whose language was not known to me. I took him by the hand and read him like a fat puppy away from the trellis, all along the path into the house. I was wearing a pair of goatskin gloves, so I did not fear picking up any germs from his grubby hands. I Bade the dimwit set at the banqueting table and rang for snipping my factotum to fetch from a beaker of water sniffing took an unconscionably long time to respond to my call, which was unlike him, it was turning into a very odd day. First the dimwit under the trevis, then a query delayed method. It was while I waited for him, that I reflected on an additional oddity where that Swan popped up from I'd never seen a swan on my estate before. When snippets eventually arrived in the banqueting Hall, he was breathless and disheveled and wreaked of malt vinegar. I sent him off to get a beaker of water for the dimwit and then record that he snippet was of foreign parentage. Either his mother or his father or both had come from a land so distant, it was not even on the same continent, but far, far away on the other side of one of the oceans, Indian Atlantic Pacific. I can't remember the names of the others offhand. It occurred to me that given his parental provenance, snippets might be able to communicate with the dimwit better than I could. While we awaited his return, I removed my goatskin grubs and thrummed my fingertips in patiently on the banqueting table. The dimwit sat still and grubby and plump, staring vacantly ahead of him. an hour passed and there was no sign of snippet. I was concerned that the dimwit would think me uncivil. Having brought him into my castle and promised him water and then left him to sit there possibly dying of thirst. While I thrummed and thrummed words would be useless. I rang for my under factotum snippet, his nephew, and when he came clumping into the banqueting Hall, his usual lopsided self on account of his corrective boot, I sent him in search of his uncle. The nephew was something of a dimwit himself, but he was always eager to follow simple instructions. He returned panting not 10 minutes later snippety explained in his curiously high pitched voice was standing under the trellis clasping to his chest the swarm, which had been strangled, presumably by snippets himself. What a pallava. I thought I asked the youngster if In addition, snippet was in possession of a beaker of water, no was the response. I apologize to the dimwit at the table. In spite of the fact that he was taking no notice of me whatsoever. He was still gazing blankly at nothing. I began to wonder if he was a blind dimwit, but when I waved one of my goatskin gloves in front of his face, I saw his eyes flicker, albeit briefly, I commanded young snippets to remain with our guests to guard him from my dogs and cats and the mad woman in the attic, who might choose this of all days to break loose and career about the castle causing havoc. And I strode out again, past the beds of Lutherans and crocus's towards the heart and found snippets, precisely as his nephew had described him under the trellis clutching a strangled one.

I asked him in an exasperated voice, why he had not fetched a beaker of water for the dimwit he did not answer. And when I looked closer, closer, I saw that he had been turned into a pillar of salt, like Lot's wife, unnamed in the Bible, but no no's addo or Edith in some Jewish traditions. What in Hell's name was going on under my premise. When I went back to the banqueting Hall, I found the dim witted young snippets deep in conversation. They were babbling and roaring and giggling together, as if drunk in a language I did not understand. I cleared my throat in a melodramatic manner to announce my presence. They fell immediately silent, and turn their heads to look at me. And then they both burst into laughter, with the most terrifying laughter I ever heard, and I can still hear it ringing in my ears. I turned and fled. I hardly knew where I was going. I only knew that I must not go anywhere near the trellis. I ran and stumbled and ran and limped and ran from mile after mile until I dropped from exhaustion into a ditch. When I came to the sky was darkling looming above me on one side of the ditch was a swamp. And on the other side, the dimwit both one gazing at me with glares of unbridled savagery. I called out a young snippet, he came clumping into view. From further along the ditch, burying a beaker of water. I dragged it down and asked him to hoist me on his shoulders and carry me home. by midnight, I was back in the banqueting Hall slumped in a chair, my head resting on the table. 17 years have passed since that awful day, 17 years in which I have not set foot outside the castle. And all that time, young snippets, now nearly as old as his salt uncle was then has been extending the premise bit by bit until now it covers almost all of the estate. In a few days more it will reach the castle wall and there will be now the scape. The den which will come for me torturing a swarm, living or dead and I will be done.

Are you sitting on a man whose name unusually was hot zinc, his character was equally run. He mattered much in that while twisting twigs into dollies Angular and emaciated they were frightening dollies quite unsuitable for the tiny tots to form the standard Dolly demographic. The airbag in his car was a wholly new type. It was devised by his cousin he had a Dozens of cousins and the name of the airbag designer was off. drib which is an anagram of bird flew off with a fat fellow who looked as if several of his airbags and exploded within him. In May 1968 he threw a pebble at a policeman in Paris. youthful folly. Now he was fat and comfortable and Borge were unable to manipulate air in wondrous ways. It was a good thing he did. For hot zinc was a terrible driver. He plowed into a gaggle of swans beside a canal. The prototype new airbag saved his life. The swans not.

This is called by kayak to the kiosk. I was mad for a crock ice, but the kiosk was a far on the other side of the lake. Several times in the past, I had walked the path all around the lake, and I knew what a long walk it was, from where I stood, and then knitties jetty gazing hopelessly at the kiosk, I knew it would take me an hour, an hour and a half more likely, in my flimsy pumps to walk that far. No man should wait so long for a choc ice without a saying or had I just coined one. The sight of the kiosk taunted me. So I shut my eyes. It's a curious fact that whenever I close my eyes for longer than a blink, I run the risk of falling asleep. The great French artist democrat held it as a tenet that the key to what a long life laying getting up early in the morning, and most important, he wrote, not dozing off again, once one was awake. If that were the case, it's a miracle. I'm still alive in my 18th year to heaven. I dozed off all the time. Even here truck is mad, standing up straight on the edge of the lake with nothing to cling on to. The wooden post of nitties jetty long ago rotted two stumps. And as I slept, so I dreamed I was five or six years old, a different like killing an ally that a different kiosk and now redundant coin gripped in my tiny fist. Though I could not see him I knew the kiosk was manned by an ogre and I cyclopean Olga come to that. He is a figure who recurs in my dreams. And though his countenance is fearsome, I feel nothing for him but boundless devotion. I do not think he is a god, this ogre, but the emotions he stirs in me Are those I imagine one would feel if one came face to face with God. I shuffled slowly forward for the queue was long, and I felt my heart beat the faster as I got closer to the kiosk, soon Oh, soon, I would reach the head of the queue. And I would look up into the one blazing I have the ogre, and I would proffer my coin and ask politely for a choc ice, and the ogre would grunt and thrust towards me his hairy pour in which was clutched. my eyelid snapped open as I woke from my dose. The Dream fell away in an instant. scuttling towards me upon the lake came a kayaker in his kayak. Now I knew a thing or two about kayaks or once did for in my long ago, youth I had been a keen kayaker. I kayaked on several lakes and rivers, remote distant lakes and wide important rivers. I admired this kayakers technique, and told him so as he came nodding against knitties jetty. We fell into the kind of easy conversation that obtains among kayakers even when one of them is 88 an unkind act. Do you know what he said? After a while I Could Kill For a Cochise. How about you jump into the kayak and kayak across the lake together and I'll buy a couple of choc ices from that kiosk, my treat. I told him he was very kind and clambered into his kayak. It must have been 40 years since I was on the water. Since the terrible day of mops is drowning. I had shunned it. Another like another time and the sky blazed blue as I was ferried in across the lake towards the kiosk of crises.

See, see if you will the king's custard crown burnished and gleaming made for metal so soft you could mold it like marzipan. By robust I do if you put your hand anywhere near it, when it's the top of the kingly head. He'll hack two fingers off and shove them one each into your ears muffling all sound, as happened Alaska my Spry confrere knitty por nithi, vanquishing death now in the Kings Don john, and all his thoughtless prodding from mere curiosity, that custard crown there's a sprig of Larkspur on the Don John's outer wall, and on all souls are pluck about and wave it has a nose guide for all the good that will do poor nithi. I plead. I plead his case with the hoity toity Chamberlains, and they're scribbling Beatles, booted callow Murgatroyd with pig eyes, not one of them are true prints cushion against fate, smacking their lips, I all at sixes and sevens aboard the boat of state. I tried my own clambering aboard it once, in spring, jaunty feather kept in gorgeous hues, but was repelled with sticks and fists and cavalry, bloodied and battered and half drowned. I was afterwards sprawled ashore in my pumps like a water devil. Snip snip the ties loose in a way it went, billowing on green out of my sight. Me sloshed in build an orphan nity. Now, step one, two and cat brisk capers and you will see the custard crown or bright dreaming, but now no longer embarked upon the kingly head. No. Whipple wills and shoma dines came sweeping in and snatched it away and carried it to a dark Ling cave and then the lumpy bumpy banks and landing of the lake. This he has his army in exile here, custard colored like the crown, pranked Swift, but so disputatious, like Jabba frenzies all the live long day and terrible night and scares can boil an egg for their supper. so caught up are they in their rebab who do they might be? The King Mo like a fell dogs still in his palace keep dab that weed pointment by his shadow line has Russian plimsolls hardly shot on his great Titanic enormous feet dangling over the end of the pilot. Up Up King birds chatter on the window sill. There is lively sparring yet in this kingdom, jack McGrew and all his train cannot lift the king hoist though they try with pulleys and contraptions of fabled strength. custard crownless his life ebbs while below in the Don john nitti waggles the severed fingers plugging his ears and jumps through spirit hoops in dank darkness. And now his army is on the march beside the railings with their banners and their pipes tooting cacophonous and swallows information flying over their horrible shrunken, withered heads. That zombie army of knitties conjuration in rags and tattered fowl with sweat, sword rusted, as implacable in their progress as a swordfish, spearing through the deep marching Clank and dangle on the palate, the collapsing palace perched on its promontory, and crumbling bit by bit into the sea. I plucked another bottle of Larkspur and waved it as a nose guy and tested the wind. The wind is coming in. There is yet an empire to be flattened.

Frank Key  24:53
Who was Captain nitti? Interestingly enough, it's a question that has never been asked before in the long March of humankind from primeval swamps to Space Age fabulous. Nobody has ever wanted to know who exactly this Captain nutty person actually was. That should tell us something. But what it might tell us that Captain nitti was an almost staggeringly insignificant figure. It might tell us that he never actually existed and his mere Figment. Note those figs. figs are and not those figs figure and Figment. We're all familiar I think from our picture books with fig one or fig I. Sometimes depending on the nature of the book, a fig might be a plate, how much easier it would be to answer our question, if we had a fig or a plate depicting Captain nitti. If that were the case, we could simply point at the picture and say there that is Captain nitti. And all curiosity, if indeed there were any would be satisfied, and we could go off and do something else, something perhaps more important, such as circumnavigating a duck pond, or visiting an owl sanctuary. But just as nobody has ever cared to ask who Captain nitti was, knows anybody ever bothered to depict him? Whether in pen and ink or dogs of paint or by mechanical means, such as a camera or blockman scope? Even the noted mezzotint test? Rex 10th never made a mezzotint of Captain nitti? Possibly because nobody was ever prepared to pay the fat fee demanded by Rex for one of his mezzotints in the absence of a fig or uplights, then how are we to go about answering the question? Is there a potted biography too, which means we might refer potted in this sense does not mean literally that the biography is to be found planted in a pot, like say, an Aspen district. We must not get in a muddle about all these figs and plates and pots. If we confuse them with actual figs and actual plates, and actual pots, our brains are likely to overheat as we struggled to comprehend what we're talking about. If such overheating does occur, and there are times when it does it does, then a circumnavigation of the duck pond, or a visit to an owl sanctuary is a splendid coolant. Brain Julie called however, we're still at something of a loss regarding Captain nitti. As we have discovered to our horror, and that is not too strong a word that no potted biography of him exists. We ought, of course, to realize this. For someone who have written a biography, potted or otherwise, they would first have had to ask the question, who was Captain nitti? or be it silently to themselves? And we already know, that is an honest question. There are of course, innumerable other questions which have never been asked even ever by anybody. How do you boil an ostrich head for example, or were the tears of St. Veronica used as a gum gum for postage stamps? We could Witter away until the cows come home, compiling a list of untold thousands of unanswered questions. But to do so would bring us no closer to knowing who Captain nitti was. Would it would have the same pronunciation as would but again, we must avoid getting all befuddled about wood as we've figs and plates and pots. Generally, we should always be on our guard against this puzzlement. I should Coco

Frank Key  28:49
I should Coco indeed. That's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. I may or may not be here next week because I'm having a fearsome operation on my right eye. So wish me luck. I might be wearing an eyepatch next week. But this being a radio show you wouldn't know that. But if I am here and I'm wearing an eyepatch. I'll make sure to tell you Bye bye.
