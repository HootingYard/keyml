Good evening, this is resonance one or 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And the last couple of shows or the last but not last week, then it was the fundraiser. But the last couple of shows my timing has been completely off. And on both occasions, I was halfway through reading a story when I realized I was out of time. So that's horribly amateurish. And I'm gonna try this week, not to end up in the same dilemma, I'd really have no choice but to stop breathing when gets towards 630. So with a bit of luck, I might manage to finish all the things I intend to redo this evening beginning with this, which is the one that I tried reading to you a couple of weeks ago, but paid no attention to how little timer has left. In her distant youth, the babyletto my nan cue with a flapper, not yet smitten by the ballet, she liked to flap about in speakeasies, getting dizzy on it with it, cocktails and executing the latest dance crisis, to the sound of Boogie woogie, and similar musical movies, as performed by hot jazz quintet led by rascals. It was in one speakeasy on 43,700 and 22nd street that Nan que encountered the lumbering walrus mustache psychopathic serial killer babinski. In those days, of course, the phrase serial killer had not yet been coined, so babinski his modus operandi remained sub Rosa, and he did not have coppers on his trail. The Helsing fools polisi may not have had their eyes on bubinski that night, but somebody else did. Working in the speakeasy sub fosc was the serial killers a long lost idiot half brother babinski. Two. He was watching babinski every move and what moves babinski was out on the dance floor, essaying some new dance steps of his own invention, which he called the lumbering psychopath. Those of you familiar with the dances of the era will recall it from its abbreviated name, the lumbar psych, which became wildly popular and spawned such hot jazz standards as Pappa dungun lopped off my limbs again and polka dots hair oil and brutality. Now, it so happened that at this time babinski two was Nan Q's paramour, they seemed an ill matched couple, the flapper and the idiot, but there was a definite inextricable chemistry between them. Plus, it was that Nan que dizzy on elicit cocktails and slump somewhat lopsidedly against babinski in their booth in the speakeasy gloom, new without asking why her darling was transfixed by the lumbering brute on the dance floor babinski to longed for a reconciliation with his long lost brother, from whom he had been partied, ever since that catastrophic picnic on the edge of the forest at the end of the war, or had it been at the beginning of the war, so fuddled was his brain, but bubinski too, could no longer remember. All he knew was that he had a burning desire to climb trees, and play, pin the antenna on the Locust again with his brother, to relive their carefree childhood in the shadow of the big formidable mountains. But idiot that he was even bubinski to knew that his half brother, being a psychopath, psychopath, wanted nothing more than to drive an axe into his babinski two's skull, and then to chop off his head and boil it in while of his horrible grease and crusted VAT in his horrible Greece encrusted cellar beneath is horrible Greece in crusted chalet. And so all he could do was to sit in the darkened booth, gazing bubinski with love and longing and terror. Then dizzy manku had an idea.

I'm sure he won't recognize you if you don a disguise, she slurred in her woozy way, we could get you up as 11 times toothbrush salesman, or a crippled Dutch ski lift, operative, and bubinski two will never get and bubinski will never get your true identity. Then, if we've persuade him there is a cuddly little hamster or guinea pig trapped at the top of that sycamore tree in the street outside the speakeasy. The two of you can climb it together, just as if you were carefree tots before that catastrophic picnic. Meanwhile, I will gather pencil and paper and a pen and a blindfold. And when you come back in you can play that foolish game you were both so fond of. What a fantastic idea. shouted bubinski to planting a kiss on Nan queues flushed Creek. You'll just have to convince your half brother that the hamster or guinea pig atop the tree is an invisible one added to the flapper. But that should not prove difficult. Just tell him there's been a plague of invisible small, cuddly animals in Helsing falls, and you will show him an eyeball and you will shut and that you will show him the press clippings tomorrow. That will give me more than enough time to make some counterfeits on a dispensing machine. dizzy actually was nine q was already displaying the resourcefulness which later stood her in such good stead as a balletto nine. That night, everything went according to plan. The flapper and the idiot managed to pull the wool over bubinski eyes. The next day however, it all went wrong. The guest stettner machine was jammed. Mice nibbled at Dubinsky twos disguise, there was a teeming downpour and thick fog. War broke out following skirmishes on the border at daybreak. When I went to meet bubinski at midday on sawdust bridge as arranged, the serial killer was armed with his axe and his Hackard and his slicer, and God knows what other fearsome sharp implements above his walrus mustache. His eyes burned with psychopathic psychopathology bubinski two and then q turned tail and fled through the narrow Helsing falls Street. It would be 40 years before the half brothers met again. During all that time bubinski to treasured his memories of that one evening for a cherished hour bubinski and bubinski two had relived the eternal of their pre picnic childhood, all thanks to the quick wit of future balletto main Nan que that article first appeared in the weekly intelligence. Van article first appeared in the weekly intelligence regarding the doings of flappers, idiots and serial killers in and around the speakeasies of antebellum Helsing falls, obtainable by subscription.

While the music was playing, I had a coughing fit. I hope it's over now. But I might might have to cough again. Here's something else. trudging through the countryside the other day, I saw ahead of me a couple of peasants standing at the edge of a bog. Excuse me, I'm going to start again. trudging through the countryside the other day, I saw ahead of me a couple of peasants standing at the edge of a bog deep in conversation. It is well known that the talk of peasants consists almost exclusively of rustic the law and wisdom expressed in the form of age old sayings In Proverbs last it was no surprise to me when the snatch of their talk I overheard as I pass them by, with one such old saying, what was unexpected was that it was one I had never heard before. A ghoul and his monkey or assumed martyred, one peasant method in the lagu breus tones of peasants the world over. his companion, said something in reply, but the words were swept away on the wind, and I heard them not. I was trudging at a pretty fair crack. So I was almost immediately out of earshot. I considered for a moment, turning about and interrogating the peasant regarding his utterance, but I quickly dismissed the thought. Trying to wring sense out of a peasant is almost always, as one might put it a fool's errand. I was still thinking about what I had overheard when I arrived home. Usually, Proverbs and sayings express a self evident truth, what we might call common sense. A stitch in time saves nine and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush are examples of such folk wisdom passed down through the generations. But I wondered, is it equally true that a ghoul and his monkey are soon martyred? After making a cup of Earth at cocoa style, boiling water, I heave down from the bookshelf, the two fat volumes on the eve of the fourth edition of acts and monuments of these latter and perilous days touching martyrs of the trudge 1583 by john Fox, commonly known as foxes Book of Martyrs. This is my indispensable guide whenever I contemplate martyrdom, admittedly, I do not do so very often, and I had to remove an crustacean of dust and grime from both volumes using my trusty rag. That done, I felt confident that somewhere within the more than 2000 folio pages of Fox's mighty work, I would find confirmation of martyrs, ghouls and monkeys. Several hours later, my brow is furrowed, my eyes were bleary, and my once boiling beige, Coco style water was stone cold, I slam shut Volume One of the Book of Martyrs having failed to discover a single reference to either a ghoul or a monkey. This was most disconcerting. before pressing on with the second hefty volume. I tried to clear my head by practicing crunch seven of Baxter's head clearing exercises. crunches two and five are usually most efficacious in my experience. But a quick rummage in the pantry revealed that I was fresh out of paper pastry cases. Also, I remembered that I had loaned my milk stamps to Bruno. So tranche seven it would have to be Hey, semi cleared I read.

Frank Key  13:24
Head semi cleared, I reheated my drink over a gasket and slumped back in my armchair with volume too. Damn and blast john Fox, I shouted to the ceiling at dusk, as the shades of night gathered in the dimpled and disgusting sky, for I had fought my way through another thousand pages, with neither hide nor hair of a guru or a monkey coming to light. It was at this point that I first began to doubt the veracity of that peasant I had overheard so many hours ago. Surely, if a ghoul and his monkey were soon martyred or indeed martyred at all, sooner or later, then they could not have escaped john Fox's notice. And yet they had I slept on easily, but woke in the morning with a renewed sense of purpose. A question thumped and re thumped in my head. Could I infer from the proverb that every dog had his own monkey, that no door was, as it were, monkey lists, or did the saying simply point out that those ghouls who did have monkeys were soon martyred along with their monkeys? Were their ghouls without monkeys who were immune from martyrdom. I could have lain in bed all day letting these conundrum if that is a word, swirl around in my head, British I did so I wouldn't be as mad as a pedal bin full of guinea pigs by lunchtime. So I leapt out of bed cut three or four bazillion papers around the room. And after a blue ting and tucking into what our Flemish pals called head onto bite, I went to the nearest zoo. My theory was that I would find evidence of ghouls in or around the monkey house. If I was lucky, I might even find a girl and a monkey together, perhaps being subjected to a hideous and barbaric execution burned at the stake. For example. This was not likely, however, I suspected that any diligent zookeeper and other any other kind would put a stop to such shenanigans. No, the martyrdom of a ghoul and his monkey would never take place in a well regulated zoo. They would be dragged away by their persecutors to a gibbet atop a tour silhouetted against an awful sky, or to a dungeon benissa Temple fought. What then could I hope to discover at the zoo? To answer this niggling question I turned as I so often do to Arthur IRA Garfunkel. Half a century ago, the DRI as he is known to his close friends had sang about being at a zoo. If I can only remember the words, I felt sure they would guide me. I tried to summon the song in my head. But though I recalled mentions of monkeys, giraffes and hamsters, hamsters, there was not a single goal. This flummoxed me until a passing zookeeper hearing my Hamming pointed out that somebody else had written the words the DRI was just singing them. They were not pure authentic Garfunkel isms. I was crushed and all the more so when the same zookeeper told me that it being Thursday the monkey house was padlocked shot. It was the monkeys day off, he explained. he plotted away this. He plotted away thin, undead and spectral clanking his trains and groaning. I went home. After taking an uneasy nap, I sat up and reviewed the situation. Thus far, my research had focused on barters and monkeys, yet the proverb clearly placed Gould at the forefront. I was working backwards, I plunged my head into a basin of ice cold water, tranche four, tossed some ectoplasm into my puppy bag, hooked it over my shoulder and pranced out of the door, affecting a determined job the draw as if I were the actor Bernard Lee in the third man, Carol Reed 1949. pausing at the corner to belatedly tie my shoelaces, I headed straight for my local branch of ghouls are out us.

Once inside, I went up to the counter and rang the bell. Its appeal was few nariyal and redolent of death bats and settled because I waited for several minutes until from behind the veil of cobwebs, a sales assistant appeared. I was immediately struck by how close a resemblance he bought to the zookeeper I had met that morning. He was thin and undead and spectral clanking his trains and groaning. I was about to ask him if he had a brother working at the zoo. But I stopped myself. I had devised a clever plan, align the stick to it, watching him closely alert to the faintest of reactions. I said. Good afternoon. Do you have any monkeys for rental? The flesh of his eyelids had rotted away. But was that the ghost trace of a blink his lips too long ago being eaten by worms. But did I discern the shadow of trembling? So foul was his countenance I could not be sure. Then he spoke and his voice came as if from a deepened desert to 1000 miles distant. No, he said, and it was all he said. And then before my eyes he crumbled to dust, leaving only a cloud of vapor hovering in the mythic air. I turned on my heel and ran all the way home, gibbering. I woke up bright and early the next morning, while shuffling head on to bite down my God. I heard the whistling of the posty he was an embittered posty how to explain his cheerful whistle. Perhaps I ought to devote the data solving that little puzzle. It would take my mind off goals and money. He's a martyrdom. Among the bills and flyers and religious tract in the days delivery, I was delighted to find the basis edition of the Reader's Digest. Having made my usual check to ensure the apostrophe in the title was correctly placed, obviating the need to write a letter of complaint to the editor. I browse to the content page. I look forward to reading I am John's head and fighting the communist menace among other articles. And if I had the time I would skim through a piece entitled when peasants matter how easy it is to miss hear their wise old sayings. Placing the magazine on my windowsill magazine placement contraption, I looked out and saw on the village green, erecting the gibbet, for that afternoon's Simeon zombie heretic hangings.

One of the more curious episodes in the life of the out of print pamphleteer Dobson is recounted in his autobiographical pamphlet 17 years in an Alpine mist out of print. It begins as follows. One day in the 1950s I was hiking in the Alps researching all things goatee for a pamphlet I planned to write provisionally entitled, all things goatee in the Alps. All of a sudden, I found myself engulfed in an Alpine mist. It was thick and swirling, the sort of mist one might find in swaging, the three witches in a production of Macbeth, or in a film by Guy Maddin unable to see ahead of me. I blundered about hopelessly lost. I had my alpin stock and a flask of vitamin enhanced boiled butter cup and watercress water treading carefully I tried to make my way down from the mountains. But no matter which way I turned, I seemed always to be going up hill Up, up and up. The mist grew thicker and swirl earlier in prose that grows increasingly hysterical, even hallucinatory. The pamphleteer reports that several hours passed. With him plotting ever higher into the Alps, he can barely see more than an inch in front of his face. so dense is the Alpine mist. Eventually, he comes to a halt when his path is blocked by a doorway. The door was wooden mahogany by the looks of it, and set within a base and brick wall. I could see very little of the latter in the thick and swirling Alpine mist, so I had no idea how high it was nor how far it extended on either side. Nonetheless, I gathered the distinct impression that I was standing outside a sort of half size replica of the winner take evaporated milk factory, where long long ago, I had worked as a junior janitor. This was most perplexing. Dobson takes a glog from his flask and then thumps his owl punch doc on the door thrice as if in a scene from a hammer horror film. The door slowly opens with an eerie and ominous creak. The pamphleteer steps inside and is disconcerted to note that the mist is even thicker, though a bit less worldly. The door of course, swing shot behind him, as in one of those films. My bafflement the door, my bafflement that the indoor mist was even more in golfing than the outside list was leavened somewhat by the fact that after hours of toiling up hill, the stone floor beneath my feet was level, but I was still lost in silence and invisibility. And then ahead of me, I saw emerging from the mist, a human or semi human or in human figure, though it was blurry and weirdly shimmer. I sensed that it was Ancient Aliens old, older perhaps than time itself. I did not yet realize that I had come face to face with a beloved sky being of unutterable esoteric wisdom. The mysterious figure beckons Dobson to follow him her it and leads the pamphleteer to a room within a room within a room within a room within a room within a room, an inner, inner, inner etc. sanctum still in shrouded in thick Alpine mist. In the center of the room stands a stone slab, an altar upon which are carved inscriptions in several different unknown alphabets. Otherwise, the room is bare cipher and esquerra tois and Anwar an heiress, a sideboard on which standard cassette player and a pile of cassette tapes, a much bigger cushion sofa bed, a pair of matching musnad, a two bar electric fire, a treadmill, a taco lamp, a Bakelite figurine of Charles W. Leadbeater, a second stone slab altar without inscriptions and potted pecan tree, several vases and bisons, a jelly making kit, a mysterious blue carton, a chemical toilet, a grandfather clock, a drum kit, an easel attack, sodomized weasel, a wastepaper bin, an espresso machine, a doormat a rug, a cat litter tray, and a few other bits and bobs. In one corner,

there is a mop and a title. And I've got a horrible feeling. I have missed time things again, I'm not sure I have time to read the rest of this story. So this is most annoying, but what I'm going to do to end this week's show is give you a couple of facts about Rudyard Kipling let's have a little snack of the music while I relocate my Rudyard Kipling information.

Frank Key  27:34
Okay, very quickly two facts about Rudyard Kipling. The first is that he was named after his favorites. He was named after his parents favorite reservoir in Staffordshire resident the ret the rod yard reservoir, where allegedly he was conceived. And the second fact about Rudyard Kipling is a quote about him from Hugh Walpole, who said, when he walks about the garden, his eyebrows are all that are really visible of him. And if you look at the graph of Rudyard Kipling, you'll get some idea of why that would be so sorry about Miss timing things badly a game, but I'll try. I'll read that whole story to you next week. Bye bye.
