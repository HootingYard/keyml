This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I'd like to begin this week with your homework assignment. I don't give many homework assignments, but I think from time to time it should, you know, prick up your ears and listen carefully. So this week's homework assignment is as follows the bats of remorse hang upside down in the cave of grief. Discuss now I'm not going to leave you to just you know, work that one out for yourself I have a model answer prepared. To give you some tips. It is a fact of nature that bats sometimes many hundreds of them hang upside down in caves. The author is making use of this image to comment upon human frailty, specifically the emotionally disruptive lacerations of remorse and grief. Bats are linked with remorse, the cave with grief. As we read and digest the phrase tears well up in our eyes and we begin to sob. Our past griefs may come tumbling back inside our heads, the inside of the head very much like a cave. If we think of the skull of stone with crags and dense. The flatter rings we feel inside it signups is snapping as we are wracked by remorse can be thought of as bats swooping into the cave to take up their purchase. Once in place, they hang their twitching occasionally, just as the lashings of remorse twitch within the parral of grief. Crucially, the writer is implying that when we stop blabbing like girlies and dry our eyes and grasp our alpins stock in readiness for a healthy hike in the mountains to watch all these mortgage drivel out of our heads. The bats remain hanging there upside down within. They do not go away. The lesson is self evident and is imprinted upon our consciousness.

Another quotation begins the next piece, not by beer pint. This is from David kinesins social history I think called family Britain. I was on a blog called rag bag.

There was Nobby Park, the human wind sock. Bell's clanged whenever NaVi Park appeared on stage for 10 or four days in the summer of 1907. He was held incommunicado by a gang of pipe test fanatics. He escaped by means of a clever poison gas device, which he kept tucked inside his vest and made his way back to hooting yard just in time to do his wind sock act at the annual Jamba re there was many Kieron lop and her trailing bandage.

For example, by leaving it leaning against a lamppost near the docks, he would pursue me to the end of my days, and badger meter throw myself into a pond. There was grez vallo fabby and his amazing tea strainers.

Not for nothing was gueuze balgo fabby, known as the Tycho Brahe of hooting yard. For one thing, he had a wood nose following a youthful pole vaulting accident. He kept his nose carefully varnished, and at nightfall, he placed it in another nickel titanium jar at his bedside. His tea strainers wrote a skin Childers drove me crackers. They were Ingmar and Hattie, the burst appendix twins, Ingmar and Hetty who were not actually twins, and whose real names were in Matt Baskerville and magnesia.

Almost certainly not. There was the zany world of Claude booja and his grotesque spunk hood. Claude booja, used a spoon to eat his peas. When feeding upon buckwheat gelatin or lamb praise.

And lastly, there was the world famous food splattered Jesuit. The world famous food splattered Jesuit was perhaps the most popular act ever to appear at the budget spinny variety theater. Why? Because quite simply, he tapped a deep vein of what the tandis call tongued. That's why.

And now I'm going to begin with yet another quotation. This is from a history of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker published in 1809. Diedrich Knickerbocker was the pseudonym of Washington Irving, who wrote many other things, including the tale of Sleepy Hollow I seem to recall. Anyway, this is from his 1809 History of New York. The tea table was crowned with a huge earthen dish well stored with slices of fat pork fried Brown, cut up into morsels and swimming in gravy. The company seated around the dream board events, their dexterity in launching their forks at the fattest pieces in this mighty dish, in much the same manner that sailors harpoon porpoises at sea, or our Indians spear salmon in the lakes. Sometimes the table was graced with immense apple pies, or sources full of preserved peaches and pears, but it was always short a boast an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough, fried and hogs fat, and called doughnuts, or Ali Kirk's a delicious kind of cake at present little known in this city, except in genuine duck families. The tea was served out of a majestic Delft teapot ornamented with paintings of fat, little Dutch shepherds and Shepherd dessas tending pigs. With boats sailing in the air, and houses built in the clouds, and sundry other ingenious duck fancies the Bose distinguished themselves by their adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper tea kettle. To sweeten the beverage, a lump of sugar was laid beside each cup, and the company alternately nibbled and sipped with great decorum, until an improvement was introduced by a shrewd and economic old lady, which was to suspend by a string from the ceiling, a large lump directly over the tea table, so that it could be swung from mouth to mouth. At these primitive tea parties, the utmost propriety and dignity prevailed no flirting nor coffee Getting no romping of young ladies, no self satisfied stuffings, a wealthy gentleman with their brains in their pockets, no amusing conceits and monkey divertissements of smart young gentlemen with no brains at all. So what have we learned from that quotation from a history of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker? Well, we've learned how you can guarantee a tea party free of Monkey divertissements by the simple expedient of dangling on the end of the length of string suspended from the ceiling over the center of the tea table, a large Sugar Lump and we have seen that this tactic has the additional advantage of preventing the guests from putting their brains in their pockets. But let us say we are contrary thoughts who wish at tea parties to encourage both monkey divertissements and the placing of brains in pockets. Is it sufficient in such a case merely to snip the dangling string with a pair of scissors and a trap or a piece to which the gargantuan Sugar Lump is attached into a waste bin or to secrete it in a drawer? Would that it was so straightforward. I'm sorry. Alas, at tea parties as in life, there is a freight of whoa before we made bascom burdened in Elysium by all means, remove the string and the Sugar Lump but do not expect at once to find monkeys cavorting around the tea table, nor your guests to pluck their brains out of their skulls and place them in their pockets. more needs to be done. First, you're advised to hire the services of a monkey Fung Shui consultant. I hasten to add that this is a person who has expertise in feng shui for monkeys, not a monkey who knows about feng shui. Several poor rattled souls of my acquaintance have plumped for the latter, and in due course, lost the shirts off their backs and a lot more. A generation ago. punks used to parrot the line, never trust a hippie and echoing then, one could well ad nor a monkey who claims credentials in the ancient Chinese system of aesthetics, believed to use the laws of heaven and earth to improve one's life by receiving positive key. Cui. Certainly, that's a mantra some extremely astute ex punk persons recite daily

Frank Key  17:40
to attract monkeys to Craig's divertissements among the cake, some tea strainers at your tea party, you will have to create the right conditions for them. And this is where a qualified monkey Fung Shui consultant proves a boon. They tend to charge quite high fees and rarely accept payment in nuts. so be warned that your tea party overheads will be steep. By overhead I don't mean the string affixed to the ceiling, because you've already deposited that in a bin or drawer along with the massive Sugar Lump dangling from it. Please, please give the consultant free rein no matter how abstruse or ridiculous a kerfuffle like kick up. Key is volatiles stuff, a bit like ectoplasm and monkey key, particularly so. clinics up and down the land are filled with persons who came a Cropper thinking they could dismiss their monkey Fung Shui consultant halfway through his or her shenanigans and finish off the job themselves. No, just let them get on with it. Your parlor will look like the wreck of the hesperus by the time they've completed their work and your wallet be empty. But monkeys of all sorts will beat a path to your door. Come tea time. persuading your guests to put their brains into their pockets is a task yet more challenging. In this case, there are as far as I know, no consultants to consult you must go it alone. Do not make the childish error of leaving on the sideboard a trip panning drill and hoping for the best. I am sick and tired of explaining that boring a hole in the skull is utterly inadequate. If one wishes for complete removal of the brain. You will need a sore actually, unless you have top of the range disinfectant facilities. You will need as many sores as you have tea party guests. The last thing you want as your guests sip tea poured from a majestic Delft teapot ornamented with paintings of fat little Dutch shepherds and Shepherd that is tending pigs and monkeys john And swing and shriek and otherwise provide divertissements is to have a troop of inspectors from the neighborhood scowls or hygiene community support hub, bashing the door down and holding the Tea Party on grounds of bylaw infraction, and they will, they will believe you me. It pays to ensure that each guest is partnered by an intimate acquaintance that is a person whom they will trust to soar through the top of their skull in readiness for brain removal. If such pairings prove impossible in advance, you will need to devise some ice breaking party games before everyone sits down to tea. Try playing fumbling with mother's broke, poke the pen in the sheet of cardboard or Catholic persecution, each of which is guaranteed to land ease. You also need to provide each guest with an over garment to be worn over their stylish Tea Party apparel. It is unlikely that any of them will attend already dressed in something with pockets of suitable size or aligning. Study a scale model of a brain and compare it with the size of an average pocket and you will understand what I'm saying. The nature of the pocket lining is equally important. And those of the over garments you distribute among the guests ought to be of satin or of a fabric equally rich and smooth. Remember the brain and all it miraculous back by resting in the pocket. It must be cosseted it is wise to make some preparations for the replacement of the brains within the skulls at the end of the Tea Party. Here I very much recommend that you first shoo the monkeys out of the way to avoid any brain being plopped into the wrong skull with untoward consequences. Each run ought to be marked with a symbol and an identical symbol imprinted on the forehead of the corresponding brains owner. You can use a magic marker for this. If you are not gifted with the ability to draw startling and memorable symbolic forms,

Frank Key  22:20
the monkey Fung Shui consultant probably is though they will charge you extra for doing so. The symbols should also be marked upon the sawed off portions of head for obvious reasons and to guard against future dislodgement. Once the brains are back within the crania and the tops of the skulls are resting on the correct head, use glue or some sort of industrial welding equipment to fix them firmly in place. As soon as the last guest has waved goodbye from the porch, you may wish to retrieve the string with its gigantic Sugar Lump appendage and hang it once again from the ceiling. This will keep those monkeys at bay so you can have a well earned nap. Next week we will look in more detail at the fat little duck shepherds and Shepherd SS and the pigs they tend both as tea pot decoration and then brute reality.

Frank Key  23:39
Here is another quote yet another quote to which I have not yet appended a commentary, although I do plan to do so. This is from the 19 late book by William Taylor miles entitled Confessions of a neurasthenic. appendicitis was a disease that I spent much time in battling. I read up on it and I knew all the symptoms. I went to the public library and hunted up and Grey's Anatomy and studied the appendix. It seemed to be a little receptacle in which to sidetrack grape seeds and other useless rubbish. I would no sooner have knowingly swallowed a grape or a lemon seed than I would a stick of dynamite. I would not eat oysters. Lest I get a piece of shell or even a pearl into my vermiform appendix. I was exceedingly careful never to swallow anything, which I thought might contain a gritty substance. I had once heard a lecture on hygiene and sanitation speak of the limy coat, which forms on the inside of our tea kettles from using hard water. He stated that in time, we would get that sort of crust inside of us from drinking water, which contained the mineral matter. I thought how easy it would be for some of it to chip off and slip into the appendix and set up an inflammation So to be on the safe side, I thought I would try drinking spring water for a while, but it gave me a bad case of malaria. I then came to the conclusion that between being dead with chills and having an inner concrete lining, I would choose the latter, which seemed the lesser evil.

Frank Key  25:30
And finally, this week, a song or a poem. So before I read that, just a reminder to go to hooting yard.org, the website where you can find for books to buy and there will be a fifth being issued later this year. You can make a donation which always helps you can take out a subscription which helps even more, and you can read untold millions of words. Anyway. This is his, uh, his, uh, his verse. There was a pig. It was in the cellar, I was listening to a record by Paul Weller. He sang Tales from the river bank. I looked at the pig and my heart sank. I looked at the pig and our eyes met the jam song definitely on my dansette a very old record player if truth be told, the seller was gloomy and damp and cold. So I lifted the needle off of the disk, I filed the record back on the misc and I unlocked the door with a big iron key and I climbed up the stairs with the pig beside me. And we ran outside into the battering sun and down to the riverbank where we had fun, the pig and me paddling splashing about with voles and otters. Then I heard a shout. A fellow was waving from the opposite bank. At first I thought he was some kind of crank. But it was Paul Weller to my amaze, dressed as he was in his style council days. Now the pig like the jam, it was that kind of pig. It had never gone near a style council gig. It grunted and trotted off back to the cellar. So was my pig river idul, marred by Paul Weller.
