Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I haven't been here for the last couple of weeks it's been repeats, but I'm back now. And indeed, he has a soul drowned in a lump of flesh, or is a piece of earth that Promethean has put not half his proportion of fire into the Muses, and the graces are his hard mistresses. Though he daily invocate them, though he sacrifice hacker tones, they still look a squint. You shall note him besides his doll, eye and lowering head, and a certain clammy, been numbed pace, by a fair display the beard and nightcap and the gown. His jests are either old fled Proverbs, or lean starved Hackney FM's or poor verbal quips, outworn by serving men tap, stirs, and milkmaids. And that was a quotation from characters or witty descriptions of the properties of sundry persons by Sir Thomas overbury. And unfortunately, I can't remember which person which sundry person that was a description of, but never mind. My diving helmet is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week on Friday afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle 14 volts to a bucolic Hamlet called mustard parva. Curiously, there is no neighboring village named mustard magner. Although a rustic barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of Gar in the local Gar pot drinking heart told me that there had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this toothless derelict said the sizable cluster of wooden buildings known as mustard Magna had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them driven insane by ergot poisoning, each pair capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling with a single flak from its mighty poor. Two hours after the first bear lumbered across sawdust bridge, the village was completely obliterated. It is still shown on some maps. Anyway, Saturday mornings jamming my bicycle into a kiosk on mustard pauvres Yoko Ono Boulevard, I joined six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. huddled together in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot. We discuss our diving helmets, and take lamentably inaccurate minutes, which are published regularly through the good offices of the mustard parva thing whose editor is none other than the blind cousin of marigolds true. The source of that piece, that paragraph is the belle of Amherst and other essays written during an unprecedented piece super by Dobson limited edition of three copies, unsigned, bound in tat and coated with a foul smelling medicament concocted by Dr. Fang, out of print.

This is a funeral oration. Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here in memory of Lars talc. How can I do justice to the memory of such a man? Let me say this, he owed me a great deal of money. He was covered in dust. He couldn't tell the difference between a Heron and a more hen. He never learned the rules of ice hockey. He was often plagued by mysterious boils. He had a scar on his left chin. He confused the different metallic elements. His hair was often unkempt, he set fire to a Bible. His pigs were neglected adept at Ping Pong he waited his bat. He wants suffered from scruff ealer his tent had many holes. He never wore a hat. His gas bills drove him crackers. He spoke umpteen languages. His mother told me he was terrified of swans. Geology was beyond him. He hankered for doilies. He counted toads. His bath was made of tin. His first marriage was disastrous. He could not ride a bicycle. He spat out mayonnaise. He avoided paying for hotel rooms by clambering down fire escapes. Once he built his own bridge, he burned himself in effigy. He loved to eat turnips, he often drooled his thumb was were deformed. rust and Ryan engaged his attention. He was much traveled, he designed his own pen nibs. He kept a photograph of Ricardo mantel ban in his Bureau. his eyesight was atrocious. Candles have been lit for him. His credentials were spotless. He punched a fishmonger he gutted hearts linctus slivered down his throat. He owns dozens of fret saws. He thought the moon was his lover. In Didcot, he wept. He fed flamingos with cream crackers. in certain circles, his name was mud. He kept his gutta percha in a gunny sack. The sight of geese made him anxious. He smoked two routes, he recounted toads. He held aloft a blubber lantern on the banks of a duck pond. His saliva was bitter. taxes were levied upon him. He had a zest for crumpled things. in parks, he pondered. He bit his fingernails, he chewed spinach. At a pinch, he would talk for hours on the subject of straw. He wiped his bottom with leaves. He wrote a book about gnats, he mumbled through a tube. Things dangled from the ceiling of his broodwar he lost on the horses, he wrapped a tortoise in blankets. As a youth he survived on crusts. His father painted difficult maps. Often he behaved like a madman, twigs and branches fell unremarked in his garden. rowing held no more for him. He dived at his brow with ointments. He was fond of cormorants. He coaxed mice from their nooks. He was knocked down by a runaway bus. clods of Earth surrounded him. He could be petulant. He strained things in a Muslim net, he pulverized a diving board with his bare hands. Morse code baffled him. He nearly became a marine. He moved his arms towards the lake. Under a cow tower. He looked at planks. He overcame his stutter. His sheep had worms, he crossed himself, he played it Bagatelle. He spied a crocus he fainted. He snored. He panted. He sprayed his stomach, his hearing aid, his cuffs, his gristle, his band, his batteries, his hardship, his chutney, his pads, his windows, his calcium, his rudders, his vinegar, his seeds, his nettles, his saws, his stall, his plastic, his incandescence, autumn shipwreck curtains, exile, frost balconies pandemonium Hydros, banisters carpet hinges, remembrance hair, custard, dribble, fanfares dampness,

Excuse me just clearing my throat still got a bit of a cold and today's the centenary of the birth of science fiction author punter Hoon jaw, who's potboiler? Attack of the Tsar guns from planet get was Dobson's favorite science fiction potboiler. There are those who say that whom draw 1907 to 1995. Is that justly neglected figure? But here are hooting yard we wish to mark his centenary. Given that he died and octogenarian, it's surprising to learn that punter who draws active career as a writer lasted just six years. His first published story, Dick dazzle and the intergalactic toothpaste horror, appeared in inexplicable yarns magazine in 1937. Following the publication of his novel, The theme dish plasma goo from outer space in 1943 hoon draw lapsed into silence and wrote Not another word in the half century until his death. Yet between those two landmarks, he was one of the most prolific writers in history. The sci fi expert Dr. Gavin Fadul when attempting to produce a catalogue resume, estimated that hundred wrote over 700 full length novels, 80 odd novellas, and an astonishing 4297 short stories. Today, not a single one of the millions of words he wrote it in print. perplexingly, one will search in vain in second hand bookshops for any of his work, and the original manuscripts written in longhand with a fat fountain pen in exquisite copperplate. What all destroyed in 1957, the by now ex author set fire to the warehouse in which they were stored as part of an insurance scam involving a gang of ruthlessly violent Bolivian thugs, and a mysterious figure known only as Henry that this may have been the self styled Dr. Henry Kissinger later to become President Nixon's national security adviser. It's clearly a load of flap doodle.

Someone recently came upon a notebook which purports to be some kind of private journal kept by Dobson never intended for publication is extremely dubious whether this is a genuine piece of Dobbs Sonia, or a forgery or whatever it is, and it's difficult to to really make much sense of the pieces written in here. I'm going to read five of them out and make them what you will. One. My mother's brooch was blue. She took me to the lake and punched my jaw. She threw my breakfast into a pond. I banged my head against a barge the day she showed me the canal to too, there were massive shutters in that room and I had never left it. Ah, I had brilliant teen in my hair. There were roses, they will lock it. I was lacking something so unnerved. But for my hatred. She'd have seen it even eating it. Got it on her eyelash, crushed it broken it exit out of someone's purse, or loved it. lost it after it. So here's my signifier. You can read it. You can keep it. You're so thick. You don't even know what to do with it. Well, eyebrows hair by pastels, then breakfast and a lover. Oh, come on. You must be guessing. Or maybe you're just so fetching. I'm done with fleshing out my lying. My hair is in a tangle and I haven't paid the rent. But I had brilliant in in my hair. And yours were better shutters. Dammit, I couldn't even see your rubbish. But I had brilliant in in my hair. Three when I stood at the edge of the lake when I stood on the bridge when I looked at the water when I saw the broken fountain when I broke my neck when I lay awake all night when I couldn't see a thing when my mind began to snap when I was spoon fed cocoa when what I said went askew when they proffered me jam when my tongue was hanging out when I loaded in all When the diving board cracked beneath me when I fell into a pond when I was all washed up when I ate too much chocolate when nothing broke my spirit when I hosted a TV trap show when I went to a wedding when I broke down in tears when I was in despair when Bracken snagged my socks when illness cast a shadow, when death appeared lascivious when sadness crushed my feelings when I was struck by lightning when all I did was worry when I threw in the towel when I was scorched in deserts when no one gave me biscuits when all I had was breathing when my gas bill sent me bonkers when you told me that I'd had it. All I wanted was illegible for when the tiny Mexican house on stilts was revealed behind such rich brocade curtains, and we fell in love. Captain snaps wooden leg was rammed between us. He was a brutish man, vengeful hirsute and lewd, prone to piss and vinegar jars and to take our clocks to bits. I remember how he left the parts dial Hans cogs and springs littered about our flat smeared with marmalade peppered with talc and reeking of his dubbing. We walked on either side of him mouthing words of iron and loading as he limped stump, clunk stump, clunk stump, clunk by the wharf, jabbering and shouting. Oh, he never made any sense. Captain snaps wooden leg was rammed between us. I took a hunting rifle and shot him through the head. Then we were together, darling, and he was good and dead. Five what land is online map? A country I call Hoon, a land of clutter and banging of hideous shrubs and rivers. My eyes rejected colors. It's gray and black in blockages. I keep a vinegar stained map rolled up in my little suitcase. Proud, majestic grand, I leap frog in the darkness. My torch shines on my map, a map made by an idiot. One day I'll lose my thread. I'll stumble in the Brecon catch fire blaze then smolder. That land was just a rumor.

Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, I know the misery of being inconvenienced by a person from poor luck. It happened last. It was a Wednesday I recall teeming with hooting yards most tremendous rainfall for 40 years. I was sat at the kitchen table attempting to insert a new pair of laces into my gleaming big black leather boots. Mini was at her spinet as usual. idli tinkling, I suspected that soon the tinkling would cease, and she would launch into an impassioned performance of one of her 10,022 songs. I hope she would play my favorite the anthem for a brutish haberdasher or perhaps mangled sea shanty bring me your winding sheet, oh mother of mine. As I fiddled ineptly with the laces, our door crashed open and a hirsutum drenched individual burst into the room. In an instant, a puddle formed at his feet. Many continue to tinker with the spinet I come announced the stranger in a declamatory roar, as if he were addressing a vast crowd of huddled petitioners. I come not from haunts of coot and Hearn, nor do I come in response to your whistle my lad. I was not whistling, I replied. Precisely, he continued, I come from poor luck and I am going to confiscate your aglets so saying he withdrew from the pocket of his bright yellow windcheater a pair of garden sequiturs swiftly cut the aglets off the ends of my brand new laces and charged out into the downpour. He did not close the door behind him. I held my head in my hands and began to weep. Many play the pounding opening chords of dismal corncrakes
