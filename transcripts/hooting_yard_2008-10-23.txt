Good evening hooting yard audience My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on resonance 104 point four FM. I'm going to tell you how I took my revenge on the monster babinski. But first I have to say a few words about the duck pond. Well, I don't have to, but I want to to clear my head. It was the kind of duck pond that had clouds of gnats hovering over it, and from which the ducks had long since fled, supplanted by swans, particularly savage swans. So rightly, it ought to have been called a swan pond rather than a duck pond. But these terms have a way of sticking, at least for me, they do. I tend to use the same names for things as I did when I was still tiny, which was a very long time ago, so long ago, that I'd never even heard of babinski nor had the world heard of babinski then, for he was yet to commit his terrible crimes. funny to think that I grew up in a world so innocent. This duck pond was one of the first ponds I came to in my days of eggy wanderlust. You know how it is when you stuff yourself full of eggs hard and soft and feel compelled to go a roaming or the hills and the meadows until you strike upon a duck pond or two. I no longer eat eggs, and I no longer go wandering as I did in those days. When I had a belly full of eggs, I had vim and the compulsion. Rare was the day I did not stamp across fields grinding daffodils underfoot, on my way to a pond in the teeth of storms. The Ducks are gone and the swans make a din, but the gnats still hover. And now my head is clear. And I can tell my tale was that Holland Dozier Holland song, the one about empty silence surrounding me lonely walls, they stare at me. I'd sing it to you if I could sing, not the whole song, you understand just those lines to give you an idea of the circumstances in which I write solitude and silence and gloom, just a ticket. In the past when babinski still run the earth, I had to write when and where I could on the deck of a packet steamer or out in the wind and the rain on a pier or bundle in the back of a cab careering along broad urban boulevards. But now I can choose and I choose a room of gloom. There's just me and my tortoise, Destiny's Child, and we're content. I was at the duck pond when I heard babinski his name for the first time. swans had already frightened away the ducks and I was in those days very keen to learn as much as I could about the intricacies of Swan behavior patterns. I camped out in tentage at the edge of the pond for what I hoped would be a jolly fortnight. On the second day, reports reached me of a terrible enormity committed by babinski at a nearby farmyard. It was the kind of thing Truman Capote he might have written about, but we're certainly not a fit subject for a song by Brian and Edward Holland. Lamont Dozier, As for me, I have not become the word drunk pen man I am now so it did not occur to me to write about it. No, I hid inside my rented tentage and beloved like a baby. When I was done, I hide over to the farmyard to see what horrors the monster had wrought. Then I vomited into a churn. I was singing hosannas at a service in a consecrated cabin in the foothills of some very important mountains. When next babinski struck. Earlier I told you I can't sing but hosannas are different. Try them and you'll see. I felt it imperative to finish the Hosanna In spite of the havoc but been scared wrote an awful license in a village in a neighboring Foothill. And thankfully, the rest of the choir agreed with me how I treasure the memory of that mighty hymn of praise. It was like a slap in the face to bubinski. Or at least that's how it seemed. We didn't learn until later that day that he'd gone on immediately to down airliner using the same method as deployed by Colonel Stewart in Die Hard to 1990 you may be wondering what the coppers were doing with time. it grieves me to say that they were utterly witless photofit shoulder lagoo breus man with a pencil moustache and pimples and one eye alarmingly larger than the other. In other words, almost the opposite of babinski. The tape recording they claimed was a bubinski, making one of his criminal demands turned out to be Mick Jagger engaged in idle

chitchat. Worse the psychic investigator attached to the case was only able to communicate with long dead as text. I began to realize that if bubinski whatever to be brought to justice, it would fall to me. In truth, I wasn't interested in justice. I wanted revenge, the farmyard the off licence, the airliner, the countless other targets of his unquenchable criminality. It mattered not where or how he struck. I knew it was me he was after. And yesterday, long last, I put an end to his reign of terror. After what 3040 years. I saw him at the duck pond. I went out that way, partly for old times sake, and partly because I still take a vague interest in the way of mean the white swans conduct themselves. I saw a stupid and shambling finger walking a dog around the pond. Don't ask me what kind of dog it was. I neither know nor care. How typical of babinski to be walking a dog around a duck pond, as if his soul was spotless. I rushed at him without warning and bashed him over the head with a spade and he fell. I picked up the dog and run it neck and then I backed by been skis heading with repeated blows of the spade. Then I threw him and his dog into the pond, where the particularly vicious swans made short work of them. I walked slowly home to my room of gloom with my spade slung over my shoulder, and then I stuffed myself with eggs. I felt young again.

Onwards now, you'll be familiar with the slow food movement, particularly if you're a guardian reader living in an eco town. Less high profile, but more amenable to the hooting yard demographic is slow botany. So I'm going to tell you all about it. Slow botany develops as a reaction against all those people who go galumphing about the countryside across fields through copses and spinneys, and extensive forbidding woodland, or indeed through jungles teeming with Exotica forever shouting, oh look, see the serried ranks of Campion and bladder word dotted among the Bracken over yonder. Or, gosh, if I'm not mistaken, there must be thousands of snapdragons scattered along the railway cuttings. There is a lamentable tendency among the sort of people who know about plants to identify them immediately and loudly and this lacks decorum and is unseemly, is it not far more rewarding to stumble about only dimly aware of the surrounding foliage. And then if you see something arresting to pair at it, a dog for hours upon hours, perhaps making a little pencil sketch of it on the back of your nature trail map, and then days or weeks later, to go to the library, and consult a large and important illustrated Reference Guide to Florida, trying your damnedest to match your memory and your pencil sketch with one of the prompting pictures in the huge leather bound volume. And that's to discover that what you looked at for so long with such interest and acuity was, for example, a marsh violet. Compare that experience with what's likely to happen if you're accompanied on your bucolic meanderings by a planting Knoll. He or she will probably have about their person a pair of binoculars, and will be wearing an ill advised hat, the sight of which will set your teeth on edge. As you trudge towards the marsh, your annoying companion will suddenly yell ahead I can see a knot of Marsh violence Dennis, and before you know it, you will have been treated to a few Marsh violent fact which may or may not be of any interest. What you will not have done is to focus every last atom of your attention on the marsh violets, blotting out everything else in the universe for a few precious hours. And this is the appeal of slow botany. Granted, it's born of ignorance, indeed of an ignorance which can at times be fathomless, but therein lies its value. So, next time you're accosted by a buffoon who literally knows his onions offering to lead you pal mailer field and green, just say no. Instead, strike off on your own myopic with a vacant head wondering at will until you see perhaps a ground nesting birds pecking at a plant that can lose you towards it. Stop, stoop and study. The ground nesting bird will almost certainly fly away at your approach. That brings us to the topic of slow ornithology, which is another matter entirely, and one Wilsher which we'll have to attend to one another occasion.

Some news of Dobson now, Dobson was invited uptown to the very top of uptown in Pawlenty town to help a judge a ranking event. The items to be ranked were rank bags of filthy laundry bowls of curdled milk slops slices of rotting and contaminated awful and the like. Quite why Dobson was thought to be an adequate Judge of such things as a mystery. It's likely that he engineered his invitation as the one chance he had to go to the top of uptown pointy town and exclusive resort. People buy fashionable chances and the certain sort of plutocrat is the kind of place where cummerbunds were worn, and wristwatches glittered. Dobson is unlikely to have worn either a cummerbund or a wristwatch, but armed with his invitation, he boarded the bucephalus and engine on the funicular railway connecting the less pointy bits of pointy town to the magnificently pointed top of uptown gold was greeted him at the station, swooping and shrieking as goals do. Oh, those pointy town goals how one misses their clamor. They still prevailed in Dobson's day and he was mindful enough to execute a quick sketch of them in his notebook since last alas. puffing up the vertical the funicular railway was scented in those days with lavender and hibiscus. And we can imagine Dobson breathing in those fumes artificial though they were as he prepared himself for the unaccustomed role of ranking judge. These contests took place every five years, and those who entered their ranking grubby moments, be they laundry bags or bowls or slices. Were arrival some crew. There was taplow of course, and Scruton and crip cage and hooter Venables and rickets to an old crumpled, stained fourth in his breeches. Not one of them was allowed anywhere near up town save for when the ranking contest took place. The rest of the time, they kept to their mittens in some dank though reasonably pointy corner of pointy town that was a part of town Dobson knew well, for he often struggled there have a morning on his way to see pigs. But now both Dobson and the rank competitors with their rank bags and bowls and slices and whatnot, were gathered in smart and flashing uptown. The very top of it so pointy that in truth, nowhere was pointed. Dobson looked at the scorecard he had been given by the referee and chewed the end of his pencil. Then he walked slowly among the trestle tables onto which the items to be ranked had been trucked. He hoped he was carrying himself in a suitably authoritative manner, akin to a top judge at say, a dog show. Dobson had never actually attended a dog show, but he'd read a vivid eyewitness account of one in vivid eyewitness accounts magazine, to which he subscribed and very occasionally contributed. So his gait was firm as he told the tables and he did much frowning slumped and bedraggled on their uptown sofa beds tapflo and screws on Kripke, Adrian hooter and Venables and ricketson. Old crumpled, stained fourth watched and waited. They had no idea that the out of print pamphleteer ranking their rank items was completely baffled and didn't have a clue what he was doing. Nevertheless, he began scribbling on his scorecard boldly and decisively. And then he handed the card to the referee and went to lean against a big pointy plaster of paris pointy thing, the kind you will only find at the top of uptown pointy town. As was usual at these events, there was a lengthy delay before the referee announced the result. In the sweltering heat, the rank bags and bowls and slices grew rancor still, netting was deployed to protect them from those fantastic uptown goals. Dobson had been hoping to use this time for some sightseeing, but was disappointed to learn from the referee that his duties included leaning against the plaster of paris pointy thing completely immobile until the result was announced.

One of Dobson's most tiresome pamphlets is the one in which he moans on and on about the regular thwarting of his touristy inclinations, if he is to be believed. Every time he had his heart set on sightseeing, someone or something dashed his hopes, busy thunderstorms, defective bus timetables, enormous puddles, recalcitrant flocks of sheep, poleaxed, kuti shredders, or in this case, a Job's worth ranking referee. But Dobson was on unfamiliar ground in the middle of an arena filled with Fancy Pants pointy town that tailors with their cummerbunds and glittering wristwatches. It was a bit like a Spandau Ballet stadium gig. And if you've ever been to one of those, you'll understand why the pamphleteer was distressed. And then long last at twilight, the referee cracked his counters and announced the result. There was uproar from both the crowd and more violently from the competitors. It was obvious to all Dobson have absolutely no idea about the appropriate ranking of bags full of filthy laundry and bowls of curdled milk slops and slices of rotting and contaminated awful he had it appeared simply fill that the scorecard at random for all his junk just a dog show posturing. He wrote a melodramatic piece about the subsequent kerfuffle over vivid eyewitness accounts magazine, but it was rejected by the editor and the manuscript is lost. All we know is that Dobson was chased out of that town by pointy Tanner's arm with pitchforks and bludgeons and was never ever invited back. He was a gloomy pamphleteer indeed for about a week after this sorry episode, but thereafter he perked up by devising a board game called picnic for detectives. His ranking of the rank items was blotted from the record, and it took place again the following day. Blodgett having been jetted in specially to do a proper job of it in first place, quite properly, was taplow, who for the next five years, wore his prize winners goat hair trousers with Jew pride.

The next piece is a very brief deceptively brief because there's much in it and afterwards, when I've read it, I'm gonna there's five questions, test questions on your comprehension, appreciation of and response to the text. So get a pen and paper. Listen very carefully. And first, I'll read it. It's called in the park. And after I've read it, I'll ask you the questions. And you can write them down. Write down your answers. A person with pimples sat on a bench spitting into a beaker in the park in the park at dusk. I stood on the lawn and shouted at him through a loud hailer and birds fled their purchase on branches of trees in the park at dusk. The dog belonged to the person with pimples was pissing against a tree. I shouted at the dog. One bird stayed on its perch on a branch. It was looking straight at me. The bird was looking straight at me. I dropped the loud hailer and turned and walked off the lawn onto a path in the park at dusk, a red loud hide on a green lawn and a person with pimples spitting into a beaker and a pissing dog and a bird on a branch. I turned my back on them and walked away along the path in the park. And somewhere in the distance I heard bells clanging dusk bells clanging and I headed towards them towards the bells clanging out through the gates of the park and across the railway bridge and pass the allotments and the clanging bells grew louder and night fell on my town. The blanket of night. It muffles our rage. The bells stop clanging muffled muffled and so here are the five questions. Number one, imagine you're the person with pimples. How do you think your sense of self esteem and integration within your community hub would be affected by being shouted at by a person with a loud hailer when you're sitting on a bench in the park at dusk spitting into a beaker. Number two, try to inhabit the mind of the dog which belongs to the person with pimples. Pretend that dogs can write incoherent English. rewrite the scene from the dogs point of view. Three the bird which remains on its perch on a branch of a tree in the park at dusk is clearly unconcerned at the den created by a person shouting through a loud hailer using your vast store of ornithological learning identifying what type of bird you think it is an argue your case with vivacity and bloody mindedness for the narrator seems to be quite ill tempered and there is a hint that he or she is an authoritarian figure who takes none too kindly to having their authority bulked. Is there anything in the text for suggest that the narrator is a disgruntled Maoist at sea in the 21st century? And finally, question five. What kind of town Do you think this is?

chunk theory is this area that everything can be crumbled into chunks, the better to apprehend its meaning. chunks are very different, say lumps or clouds or crumbs or bits, and most certainly never be mistaken for smithereens. The proper definition of the trunk is given in the standard work on trunk theory. chunk theory, a primer, by the theories original theorized Gustav trunk trunk was of course, not the name he was born with. It's a pseudonym, he hit upon the better to identify himself with the theory he propounded when he was not writing about trunks, trunk busied himself destroying all trace of his true surname so successfully that today we know him only a chunk, and do not have an atom of evidence regarding his real name. There's even some doubt as to whether or not his first name was Gustav. But as the parlance of today has it, let's not even go there. chunk was fond of demonstrating the beauty of his theory by physically crumbling things into chunks, even things that do not readily lend themselves to be crumble. Faced with such a thing, a public telephone Kiehl's Craig's Sample trunk had no qualms about deploying hacksaws axes, large, heavy hammers and similar tools in order to affect his goal. He could regularly be seen marching about his town smashing things to bits. Although when challenged, he would protest that he was engaged in the, quote, assisted crumbling of things into chunks. Unquote. And boy, oh boy was he challenged, he made innumerable complaints that he was being followed about by municipal cohesion officials and coppers arguing that such stalking was a form of entrapment. Much of the primer was written in the waiting rooms of various courts and the sizes were trunk was due to face sanction.

Frank Key  25:50
He was the kind of man who tended to topple over when shoved with sufficient force, and this led him to refine his theory in later years, shoving and toppling would be incorporated alongside crumble meant and chunks without doing damage to the premises of the original theory, say for the sort of collateral damage one might expect. How it would all have held together is something we can only get out for the promised second edition of the prime and never appeared. trunk himself was cagey whenever he was asked about it, which was seldom there's very few people very, very few people were remotely interested in his work. One chunkiest commentator claimed that only four copies of the primer whatever sold each of them to cronies, with whom chunk used to hang around in the streets of his town, laden with axes and hammers and slicers. eyeing up likely targets for assisted crumbling. But there are other chunkiest commentators who hold radically different views. Indeed, the most intriguing feature of the whole business is that chunkiest commentators dispute and devotees, fellow travelers and hangers on vastly outnumber the total number of people who've ever even laid eyes on a copy of the primer, let alone read the damn thing. This signal factors led to an offshoot of chunk theory known as chunk theory theory, a field which has spawned an entire academic industry, populated by beardie good for nothings, who would be better employed digging drainage ditches, some of whom apparently actually do such drainage ditch digging in between penning abstruse articles for the numberless chunk theory theory journals. I went to interview one such peasant scholar for this piece, but when I approached him, he shoved me with considerable force, and I toppled into the drainage ditch he had just completed digging such other perils of academe. I brush them aside for I am both hoity toity, and I know where the bodies are buried. My father was a grave digger and his father before him, and they knew roughly where the bodies were buried, but on which side their bread was buttered, and they knew their onions too. You will rarely find a peasant scholar, chunkiest or otherwise who knows such things. I was minded to follow the family grave digging tradition, but I proved to Wheezy to handle a spade. Ironic I suppose that I end up flailing helplessly on my back at the bottom of a drainage ditch, while chunkiest starts to shoveled chunks of crumbled Earth over me like a scene from a cheap horror film. But I shall abide so I crumble to dust dust in crumbled chunks, and in each crumbles chunk, a worm that borrows

Frank Key  29:08
and each crumbled chunk of worms at barrows indeed, that's the end of hooting yard for this week, and I'll be back next week. Everything permitting Bye bye.
