Good evening This is Frank key with hooting yard on the air. And I have just received a gift at the studio. It's a paperback by Eunice su DAC and the cover says the story of the strangest torture any man ever suffered x. And in big letters it hasn't got unit sued x name, but Ray metal and his real name was Reginald Truscott Jones. So it's the novel of the film The man with X ray eyes, so I'm very pleased to receive that. And very, very many thanks to Mike Jennings banished to a pompous land who sent it to me. Thank you very much, Mike. I just saw you know if anyone else would like to send me gifts, paperback books, cake, hard cash, just pop it in the post to resonance FM with for the attention of Frank key and I'll receive it and I'll read out your name on the show. So you'll be unable to contain your excitement and I'll be happy with my book or cake or money. Anyway, enough of that nonsense. There was a program on the box the other week called gas rigs stripped down. According to the listings, quote, Tom Wrigglesworth and Rob Bell watches a gas platform is pulled from the North Sea and taken to Newcastle to be disassembled. This sounded quite exciting, but I didn't watch it for two reasons. First, because from that description, I feared that we would learn a lot about the personalities of Messrs Wrigglesworth and Bell at the expense of just watching a gas rig being dismantled. Second, because I would have preferred a program in which without the intercession of the presenters, we watch a gas rig platform being pulled from the North Sea and taken to Newcastle to be disassembled by monkeys. Actually, it will be even better as the Gatwick was left where it was in the middle of the North Sea. And monkeys copped it out to it to dismantle it in situ. Alan Partridge was onto something with his idea of a monkey tennis monkeys taking apart large pieces of infrastructure would make splendid television. I would place watching monkeys dismantling a gas rig pretty high on our list of things I'd like to see before I die up there in the dismantling section with seeing a life dismantle the muffins. That's a reference to Thomas de Quincey. You may wish to look it up on the hooting our website, type a life and dismantle of muffins into the search bit and you'll find it. Generally speaking, I think any large scale sea based construction such as a gas rig or an oil rig, or even a huge rusting container ship is best taken to bits by animals. This is not without precedent. years ago, at the time when the kitty and fag coach company was still plying the coast roads of Kent from Dover to Margate. There was an occasion when hundreds or possibly thousands of wat hawks were let loose on a dilapidated and decommissioned hospital ship. The dean of grunting was incredible and drowned out the sound of foghorns. But there wasn't much left of the ship by the time the hogs were ferried back to shore in a flotilla of motorboat. Wild animals will just get on with the job in a frenzied manner. Insects too can be utilized for dismantling purposes and some beetles and other tiny scurrying things can overrun the largest gas rig in a matter of minutes and can destroy it with surprising speed.

Monkey demolition was pioneered by Chitty and fag when one of their share of banks or pantechnicon was ready for the scrap paper. They would drive it out to the seaside and park it by the shore. Then go and collect some monkeys. They had one or two menagerist in their pocket. left to their own devices. The monkeys made short work of the clapped out coaches. A few elderly people in those parts can remember being taken down to the beach to watch monkeys dismantling shower banks, and we'll tell you all about it over a cup of cocoa. But their carers always think they're raving and delirious. Some of us know better. The beach based dismantling is with Kitty's idea. fagg. The visionary wanted to have their redundant vehicles towed out to sea, and deposited on a specially built platform out of sight of land. Once in place, it was his intention to test out various beasts and birds and insects to see which would do the most efficient job. He had a curious mania about leaf cutter ants, for example, and also authors treaty, who helped the purse strings vetoed the idea on grounds both of expense and share common sense. fag went away, went ahead and had the platform bill anyway, using money provided by one of his uncle's a rascally blackguard with a suspicious mustache and a gap in his teeth, the spitting image of Terry Thomas but the menagerist, who provided the animals were loyal to charity, who knew how to wrap them around his fingers with promises of charity and fag shares, debentures and other financial inducements. The Koch company founders fell out. Chitty had his monkeys and his beach dismantlement fag had a useless platform rusting away in the sea, and no animals to tow out to it. Even if he had a means to get one of the old Shera banks to it, which he did not faze uncle had fled to Bolivia with the police in pursuit. I would like to say in hot pursuit, but quite frankly, fags uncle was small fry as far as the coppers were concerned. And they sent only one detective to Bolivia to run him to ground, a semi retired and muddled headed fellow called Simpkins. Interestingly, Simpkins came from a family of Monkey trainers on one side and infrastructure disassembling experts on the other. I've not yet been able to find out which side was which, whether it was his father's a lot, who trained monkeys and his mother's kid and who demolished large constructions, or whether it was the other way round. Nor do the extant records tell us why Simpkins himself followed neither trade and became a copper instead. He did write his memoirs, but they're so unutterably tedious that nobody's ever managed to get past page 10 by which point the future detective has not yet been born. In spite of their differences, tricky and fag kept the coke company going. Monkeys continued to ravage their unwanted vehicles to the delight of parties of children taken to the beach to watch. As for fags, see platform, some sites still there are rusted Hulk serving as a rest stop for orcs and guillemots and skewers and turns and gulls and other seabirds, but no one is quite sure exactly where it is. What we do know is that according to fags note, it is as enormous as the most enormous of gas rigs as yet and dismantled by monkeys out in the sea.

Just like to point out that kitty and fag is or was a genuine coach company. Although I did take certain liberties with Mr. Chitty and Mr. fag and if any of their relatives or descendants are listening to this, no offense was meant quite the opposite In fact, Natty dread, like it or lump it, it has become clear to any thinking person that Emperor Haile Selassie, or Rastafari was indeed a living God. Admittedly, the thinking done by those persons is conducted with their brains ravaged by pot, but that does not make them Thinking any less cogent? Well, it does and perhaps they might think a teensy bit more cogently with clear ahead, but they would surely reach the same conclusions regarding Haile Selassie and jar Rastafari and the escape from Babylon and all that business. Natty dread indeed. It has long perplex me that Fr. Leavis in expanding his so called great tradition wholly ignores Emperor Haile Selassie not withstanding that leave this was batter you rather than Natty and while today we might dismiss his prescriptive insistence that the only great English novelist or Jane Austen George Eliot, Henry James, Joseph Conrad and poor, demented d. h. Lawrence, it beggars belief that leave it constructed grant grand edifice without placing jar at its Pinnacle. It is true that jar did not actually write any English novels, and can thus safely be left out of account. But that just won't do will it? Not for me anyway, or I and I, I should say. If one trawl through the collected works of Austin Elliot, James Conrad poor demented Lawrence and Leavis himself. The first thing that strikes one is that jar does not even get a mention. One recalls with closer attention, hoping to find stray references one has missed the first time round, but again, emerging empty handed. This actually takes rather a long time, given the sheer amount these people wrote. And as one begins the third desperate crawl, one begins to wonder if it might not be better simply to ravage one's brain with pot and call it a day. But one persists as one must wear Emperor Haile Selassie is concerned. Once again one finds Not a trace of jar. Truly we are in Babylon. It is of course always possible that had either Austin or Elliot or James or Conrad or poor demented Lawrence or leave this issue to debate versions of their work, we might find what we're looking for. To take just one example, Mansfield parking dub, had it ever existed, would I think be more sure footed text than the original? It would probably also find room for Natty dread. I say probably rather than certainly, for one does not wish to engage in fruitless conjecture. fruitlessness must always be avoided. That's not a lesson I've taken directly from john Incidentally, except in a roundabout way. But then around about why is by definition indirect. Could it be I wonder that one can approach His Highness The Emperor Haile Selassie john Rastafari similarly indirectly, in a roundabout way in the works of our canonical authors, or bit in the absence of dub versions of their books. This will of course, necessitate a fourth, even more eagle eyed trawl through their collected works. Still, we must put off the ravaging of our brain with pot. And so once again, we slumped against the tree trunk with a huge pile of books next to us. Above in the higher foliage, monkeys cavort and chatter. They're not so far as we can see monkeys with typewriters who might given time type out the complete works of Austin and Elliot and James and Conrad and Paul demented, Lawrence and Leavis. Could they, in a fraction of the time type out dubbed versions.

Setting aside the copy of under Western eyes We have just opened for the fourth time, we look up and count the monkeys. Nine monkeys, for which we will require nine typewriters and trusting our pile of books to the safekeeping of a dreadlocked Rasta slumped against the neighboring tree his brain ravaged by pot we set off for the nearest typewriter shop by one of those curious coincidences one meeting certain songs by Gordon summer. The name of the shop proprietor is fr Leavis. Are you any relation we ask? There follows a lengthy and somewhat ill tempered account of distant cousin edge. were relieved to hand over the cash and make our exit from the shop nine secondhand but reconditioned typewriters he put upon our barrel under the neighboring tree The pot rabid Rasta is leafing through the mill on the floss. Have you found any trace within the text that Elliott is conscious of the divinity of the Emperor Haile Selassie, we ask more to make conversation than in hope of a coherent reply. There is great suffer ation in Babylon. He says, puffing on his pot. You wouldn't have a dub version of this novel, would you? Not yet we reply, but soon, I hope soon, and we pointed the barrel of typewriters. And then the monkeys cavorting and chattering are top of the trees. With the assistance of the affable Rasta, we set up the typewriters and align along the beach. Then we coax and cajole the monkeys down from the trees using fruit as a luer. Another reminder of the perils of fruitlessness soon enough, they're tippy tapping away, taking occasional rest break to pick nits from each other's hairy coats. Wave his lap against the sandy shore, the sun blazes in the sky, the securing the offer pot, and instead glugging a tumbler of lemonade. We keep our brain on ravaged our head clear, but our heart is thumping for what we're witnessing. watching our monkeys typing away is the birth of a brand new great tradition, one which will propel fr Leavis into the dustbin of history, one in which jar Rastafari assumes his proper place atop the pinnacle of English literature in dub that he indeed, Natty dread.

I was looking at Mr. Key at the time.

Frank Key  19:07
I'm sorry, we're having a discussion here. Me and pansy cradle Jew who was just reading to you and john Johnny seven engineer about why. Presumably she read this from the from x the raima land unit sudak book, which, as far as we're all aware is not a Western. And yet, it seems to think they seem to think that having read that you'd want to read lots of westerns. Personally, I'm puzzled as to why gringo GM is five cents cheaper than all the others. But that's another story entirely. Right? Yes. I think I might have to write some of those as opposed to read them. Black is the color of my true love's bear. It is Big fears black and untamed bear and it lumbers about roaring. She has confined it to her attic. Why I asked my true lovers we can noodled on a municipal park bench to cheeky by wild black bear in her attic. It was a sorry tale she told me of her twin brother of his job as a zookeeper of the closure of the zoo of the need to find homes for the zoos, birds and certain it ants and dromedaries and gazelles, it's sharks and bears have her twins. So philia and off is volunteering to take the big fears black untamed bear a home with him of how, as brother and bear went hand in poor along the vein leading to his home, the bear set upon him fast and furious, gouging and slashing and thumping and biting until her twin lay dead upon the path beside the river, of how upon its further rampages, the bear fetched up outside her my true love's house and bashed its way through the door roaring, of how she coaxed it up into the attic, with a bowl of water and dumplings, and of how she slammed shut the door at the top of the stairs, and blocked it with a large mahogany sideboard, of how she sat exhausted and weeping in her kitchen, until I came knocking at her door and invited her to join me for a walk in the municipal Park. And for a car noodle on the municipal park bench. I didn't know you had a twin, I said. He lives dead upon the lane. So I have a twin no more, she said. Now I have but his bear. What will you do? I asked. Short of keeping it confined to the attic and feeding it with dumplings and bowls of water. I have no idea, she replied. I'm sure you could sell it for a tidy sum to an inhumane raskal, I said, at which my true love ceased canoodling and glared at me and slapped my face. How dare you suggest such a thing? She cried impassioned. That bear may be big and fierce and black and untamed. But it is my last link with my dead twin, and he loved it more than life itself. And she stood up and strode away across the municipal Park lawn. The course of true love seldom runs smooth. But I couldn't help thinking that it damn well ought to. Clearly I had upset a clo more than I knew. And I would have to find some way of making it up to her. But how that would be pointless to try to raise her brother from the dead, for I have had a batshit resurrection in my time, and it failed utterly. Could I reopen the zoo and convince my true love that the bear would be happier there and market back from whence it came. But then I would presumably have to go and collect all the birds and serpents and ants and dromedaries and gazelles and sharks to and somehow provide for them. The more I thought about it, the more probable it seemed that the bear was going to be lumbering about in a sealers attic for the foreseeable future. It would get lonely up there. Perhaps what I needed to do was to procure another bear from another closing down zoo, and take it to the attic to be a POW.

Frank Key  23:52
But in doing so, would I not risking leaving the second bear along the line by the river towards her house? The same fate as my true loves twin brother, I too, might be gouged and slashed and something bitten and left for dead, and that would not help anybody. I was still sitting on the municipal park bench. mulling these things over. When I saw my true love Come sprinting towards me across the lawn. Oh, woe is me. She was crying first my twin brother and now the bear. What has happened, my darling dear, I asked as she slumped on the bench. I took up a bowl of water and a dumpling for it, and it choked on the dumpling. She cried. I could not revive it. try as I might. You gave the bear the kiss of life. I asked curious. I tried. Yes, I cried. She said. Like that week, there was a double funeral. For my crew loves twin brother and for the bear. We buried them In the same tome, we warned, we wept. We wore black, black, black.

Frank Key  25:32
Before we go, no more westerns, unfortunately, but a little snippet from the life of john Stuart Mill, and his wife, Harriet Taylor. This is from a book called parallel lives five Victorian marriages by Phyllis rose, published in 1984. When they were apart, they questioned and instructed each other minute Lee on the state of their health. How is it my darling mill inquired, that you say you have broken the habit of expectoration? When you cough? Are you not obliged to swallow something if you do not spit it up? I cannot think, replied Harriet, with her characteristic note of self righteousness, that if you tried as earnestly, as I have done since October, to avoid any expectoration, that you would lose the habit altogether, as I have done. It was her idea that mill was bothered by phlegm because he was in the habit of spitting. Not that he was forced to spit because he was bothered by phlegm. Perhaps she was right. Interesting, isn't it, we don't tend to think of great personages of the past, like john Stuart Mill, or Ruskin or, you know, the big names. We don't think of them kind of spending their time writing letters to their wives about spitting. But that's what john Stuart Mill did. Very good book into that now, I do recommend it. And that's all from hooting yard on the air for this week. Many thanks to pansy cradle drew for reading us some exciting Western plots, I have to say. And to john, of course, for engineering as ever, who rarely gets credit, but make sure you hear this. And I'll be back next week. I went to Mike Jennings as well for sending me the book. And yeah, I'll be back next week before the last show before the resonance summer break. Bye bye.
