Hello, this is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this week's show inadvertently or unintentionally, has a kind of overarching theme. It makes it quite exciting. Because we're going to be examining a couple of folk songs, a nursery rhyme, and unseasonally A Christmas Carol. There was no intention necessarily to concentrate on these matters. But that just seems to be how it's worked out this week. So let's begin unseasonally with the Christmas Carol. Now call me slow witted, if you will, and over the years many people have. But it took me an extraordinary length of time to realize that the manger, a way in which the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head was in fact a barnyard animal feeding trough. Yes, yes, I know that the Carol is quite explicit on this matter, pointing out that the Holy Infant had no crib for his bed. But somehow in my mind, I've always associated a manger with a newborns sleep facility, rather than as what the Oxford English Dictionary calls and I quote, a long open box or trough, in a stable barn, etc. Out of which horses and cattle can eat fodder. That's what a manger is. You see what I mean about being slow witted? Anyway, what occurs to me are the immense repercussions had some roaming ravenous barnyard omnivore, fallen upon the manger, and understandably assuming its content to be dinner, gobbled up The little Lord Jesus. 2013 years of Christian civilization would have been as naught. Imagine that if you can. Though, we might further consider the possibility that the barnyard omnivore having ingested the Messiah could itself have become the focus of human religious yearnings. Let us assume that Joseph and Mary find responsible parents as they were, were distracted by the arrival of shepherds and wise men and kings and took their eyes off there mewling infant just long enough for the ravenous beast to come clattering into the farmyard building and guzzle a baby down. Incidentally, just as I was confused about the precise nature of a manger, I was equally muddle headed about the provenance of the three kings. I thought they were we three kings of Ori on tar. I had no idea where Ori on tar might be that it sounded vaguely like a region of outer space. Nor why had three kings rather than as usual, just the one unless one is in Westeros, which has several, but the kings of Westeros I continue ality continually at each other's throats. Whereas the three kings of Ori on tar seemed like boon companions traveling together across the desert, or possibly the red waste following a star. Anyway, if we assume that Joseph and Mary and the shepherds and the Magi and the three kings of Oregon tar suddenly heard a great gulping and belching sound from the ravenous omnivore and turn to look, they might very well want to make sure that the beast does not go running off. It might be too late to save the little Lord Almighty. But the barnyard beast itself is now clearly sacred. It contained within it The light of heaven and the hope of all mankind.

goats are omnivorous as far as I know. So let's say that it's a goat that has swallowed the baby Jesus. It seems likely that over the succeeding 2030 years, we would have devised a culture based upon a goat God. How different would our history be? It might be interesting to run the permutations through a super duper computer. As long range weather forecasters and climate change persons do. Or more cheaply, one could create a board game to wile away the starlit evenings snuggled down in heaps of straw in barnyard faraway.

However, not all of the show is about Nursery Rhymes folk songs and Christmas carols. This piece isn't one of Dobson's more ambitious project was the complete anatomy of birds described in majestic sweeping prose in several hefty volumes. And characteristically, he kept this one under his hat and did not discuss his progress with his inner Marotta marigold to over breakfast. I am puzzled, said marigold one morning smearing compacted gunk onto a wafer of dough. your usual practice is to babble incontinent Li to me over breakfast, about whatever it is you're writing. Yet for the past week or so. You've either been silent or have spoken of quiet other matters is everything hunky dory and the Dobson head. hunky dory does not begin to describe it, said Dobson. After swallowing with some difficulty, a mouthful of runny egg and cheese strong bap. I have embarked upon what may be my greatest achievement, the one I will be remembered for after I am gone. I have not spoken of it to you because I fear you will dissuade me from tackling or work of several hefty volumes, advising me instead to stick with me or pamphlets. Well, you are a pamphleteer. Dobson said marigold to dallying with a stray pee on her plate. But I have every confidence in your ability to write several hefty volumes. So long as you choose a subject you know something about? I might throw up my hands in horror. However, were you to be so delusional as to think you could write sensibly at length on a topic of which you're blisteringly ignorant. Such as ask Dobson, who was ever loath to admit that there just might be one or two things in the universe that he knew nothing about. Birds said marigold actually spoke there was a thunderclap rain lashed against the windows, and the sky grew dark. As it happened, said Dobson. I am at work on chapter one of book one of the complete anatomy of birds described in majestic sweeping prose in several hefty volumes. marigold two threw up her hands in horror, inadvertently upsetting a tumbler of onair rated potato juice. God help us she said. Volume One is entitled the beak and my plan is to devote at least 400 pages to that fascinating topic, said Dobson. May I ask said marigold how much you have written thus far? Oh, just a couple of lines said Dobson. I admitted slow work, but I'm kept busy with my research. And those two lines are asked marigold. All birds have beaks I think, quoted Dobson. Commonly they are located on the lower front part of a bird head. Would it be fair to say, continued marigold to mercilessly that you've turned to your research, whatever that might be? Because you have exhausted your knowledge of the beaks of birds? That answer came there none. For Dobson pretending to a sudden but delayed terror of the thunderclap had scurried under the breakfast table, as if he would James Joyce, during a thunderstorm in shaven ingan. Later that day, he abandoned his bird book, and wrote instead that timeless classic among his pamphlet, how I hid under a table during a thunderstorm and ruined my trousers by kneeling in a puddle of an aerated potato juice. And what this tells us about the indomitable human spirit in extremists out of print

generations of tinies have grown up learning the nursery rhyme with the rude folks on index number. That's rude. Our o UD the rude folks on index number 21143. To wit, right, a cock horse to Banbury Cross, to see a fine lady upon our white horse rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, and she shall have music wherever she goes. In a recent earth shattering research paper, published in the weekly earthshattering research papers digest boffins at the Center for Banbury crosses, studies make a convincing argument that the third the third line of the rhyme is wrong. Using state of the art techniques involving a big magnetic robot. They claim that it ought to read wrinkles on her fingers and boils on her toes. The lady may indeed be fine, but she's also a Crone or a hag. It is thought that she is related by sisterhood to both the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman and the woman of twigs. And Shakespeare probably had the trio in mind when he was writing the tragedy of Macbeth. In a related development, other boffins at a different center for other studies have been using state of the art techniques involving a tiny rubber nozzle to identify the music that the lady with wrinkles on her fingers and boils on her toes was listening to wherever she went. There. An arguable case is that the music was some particularly argumentative German improv racket, made with dustbin lids and hammers and hideous electronic buzzing noises. Together these two studies shed an entirely new light on the nursery rhyme. It's a light that the present day inhabitants of Banbury Cross, find on welcome. And there have been mutterings in the streets, and dark deeds plotted in the taverns and pebbles thrown at puffins. excitingly, the latter hoo ha has given rise to the creation of a brand new nursery rhyme right o'clock horse to Banbury Cross to see all the boffins Sorry, I'm going to start that again because I misread it. Rider kolkhorst to Banbury Cross to see all the citizens get very cross. Let's all throw pebbles at the boffins until they end up in their coffins.

This is an exciting story called The mysterious Tell. On the seafront in the town of screwin hoon Puj stands the hotel splendido. It has an exclamation mark to the local screen hunahpu jewels however, it is invariably known as the mysterious hotel. The Mystery of the mysterious hotel is that nobody seems to know the nature of its mystery. Like any other hotel is it seen its share of puzzling incidents of vanished sock in the laundry. Intermittent hissing noises on the intercom, the face of Starling on a slice of toast, but these are mundane and ephemeral. What is the overarching mystery of the mysterious hotel? One man who was unable to prize this question out of his head with detective Captain unstrap nods towel when he was tiny, he regularly stayed at the hotel splendido for a summer fortnight for screwin hunahpu was his parents favorite holiday destination. Early then, he learned the locals term and badgered his mom and his power and other adults to reveal the mystery to him. But of course, nobody did, for nobody knew. Through the passing years, and during his career as a tip top detective captain, he never quite stopped thinking about the mystery of the mysterious hotel. He no longer visited the seaside resort, for his dear wife was terrified of the sea, and all their holidays together, we've taken inland spots, forests, and dingles and coppices. But there came a time when that good woman perished in a tobogganing accident, and the next summer, the widow was not determined to return to the scene of his youth, arm now with many years experience of Tip Top detective work, he felt confident that he could solve the mystery that had perplexed him for so long. He arrived at screwin hunahpu Parkway railway station on a blisteringly hot July afternoon. He was astonished to note that the porter who took his suitcase from him and carried it the length of the platform all the way to the station gate was the very same Porter he remembered from childhood. Yet the man had not aged at all, nor had the station itself changed. I feel I am stepping back into the past, he said to the porter. I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about, sir, said the porter. They were now at the gate and unstrap Ronald Taub gazed at the town square, and across to the sea front, and the back of that hotel splendido. Everything seemed utterly unchanged from when he had last seen it 40 years before. I have not been here since I was a child, he said, and yet it seems utterly unchanged. The Porter gave him an odd look, as if he were a dangerous lunatic, and hurried away to carry another suitcase for another disembarked railway passenger. Looking about him in wonderment, and strength not tab made his way to the seafront. Everything was as he remembered it. The brass band in the square playing on par music, the pie and pastry shop, the creaking tram with its vampiric conductor, the stone statue of Ringo Starr bewildered and unnerved he stepped into the hotel lobby. Here at least things have changed. If anything, the interior of the hotel splendido looked like a vision of the future, the distant future. He marched up to the reception desk, which was more like a space age console. I have a reservation, he said, Detective Captain unstrap not Taub Ah, yes, said the receptionist appearing at the screen of a super duper computer, then. Oh, I'm sorry. Your room has already been re reserved by another guest.

Frank Key  19:51
What do you mean reserved? Well, it's all hustle and bustle in the hotel business. You know, we can't let time slip Still, and he looked up, and detective Captain on strugnell tab realized that the hotel receptionist was a hyper intelligent monkey as an advanced stage of evolution.

Wasn't that an exciting story? We're going to return to a flat No, no, we're not going to we've had we've had a Christmas Carol and a nursery rhyme and now I'm going to talk to you about a folk song. Yes. hooba nuba who bent Cronje. He fought in the ACC and he flew our foes. He lopped off their heads and stuck them on spikes. With his beveled sword he flew and flew. Now we carry his bones to their resting place in the Palace on the hill under a cloud of crows. But the mighty bent Cronje will never die. He is reborn daily as a bird

Frank Key  21:43
that's a translation and not a very good one of the so called bent Cronje song commemorating bent crunk the ancient hero who saved the town of screwin, whom food from attack by the forces of get the so called King across the act. Chief interest for historians is the mention of the palace on the hill where in the name of heaven was this palace. There are no hills anywhere near screw Puj the land they're about is flat for as far as the eye can see. And indeed, much of it is Boggy and marshy and then puddle. If the sight could be located, it would be possible to have a dig with spayed to see if there are any bones buried there. The presence of bones would not necessarily prove the historical existence of bent Cronje himself Of course, but it would give but it would give scholars something to mull over. As things stand all we know bent Cronje is his song, and a shield, much battered and dented and Rusty, kept in a glass case in the vestibule of screwin hunahpu arms house. If you said according to the handwritten cards stuck next to it to be bent crunches shield, which he carried with him as he folded the act and locked the heads off get army. The provenance of the adjacent piece of cardboard is dubious, with some claiming it only appeared in the glass case last Thursday. If that's true, bent crunchies Shield might be any old scrap of battered and dented and rusty metal dug out of a pit somewhere in the vicinity. It might not even be a shield. Whereas the historians are stymied and sill until such time as they can find the location of the palace on the hill. Not so the ornithologist. Unsurprisingly, quite a number of bird experts getting quite a flap about the idea that bent cron job is reborn daily as a bird. There are competing theories. one strand of thought is that the soul or essence of bent Cronje is present in a new hatchling every day, implying that, over the centuries, untold thousands of birds have actually been bent crunk simultaneously. Against this, some argue that there is but a single soul or essence which somehow flips from bird to bird by a process we puny humans cannot Hope to comprehend. There was a fad a few years ago for bent Krong birds seances, a bird would be trapped and in caged and brought to a darkened room, and the cage placed in the center of a round table. Various spiritually minded ornithologist, would be seated around the table, and they would attempt to elicit from the bird some indication that it was the living embodiment for that day at least, of the legendary hero. The process usually involves wrapping noises, sudden chills in the room temperature, and the spewing of Ecto plasm. no definitive bent chron bird was ever identified, which is hardly surprising when one considers the foolishness of such behavior. My own view is that someone ought to study very carefully that translation of the song I suspect it is woefully inaccurate. And that the word bent and Cronje and AK, and foes, and locked and heads and stuck, and spikes, and beveled and sword, and slew and bones,

Frank Key  26:34
and resting place, and palace, and Hill, and crows, and reborn and daily and bird are all wrong. It would be immeasurably helpful if we knew from what language it has been translated.

So anyway, we're coming up to the end of the show, and we have another folk song or a fragment from a folk song, but I haven't really got anything to say about it. So and I won't sing it because we all know what happens when I try to sing, but I'll just recite this folk song, tele where it's from. And maybe you can then go and do some further research and find out more for yourself chavela chavela What do you shuffle? I'm shuffling the muck outside your hovel. shuffler shoveler please desist. I love my mark. It will be much missed. peasant, oh, peasant, the muck is not yours. I'm shoveling it off for a greater cause. The cause of the princeling who owns your muck, as he owns you, your hovel and your duck, and your pot and your pan and your hay and your straw. The princeling needs your muck for the war. chavela chavela. What war is that? It is the War of the princelings hat. And as I say, that's a fragment from an old folk song. And the song is called the War of the princelings hat. Personally, I don't know anything about that particular war, but maybe you can find out some more. If you do, send me an email and I'll share that with listeners next week. That's all for this week. Bye bye.
