Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. We're continuing this week with the reading of the entire work obsequies for last tauk, struck by lightning, which was originally published in 1994. And has never been reprinted. So yes, we're onto chapter eight. On the morning of the second Tuesday in July, as last town was passing along the avenue act towards the scientifico Medical club, a mighty thunderstorm was blasting the heavens, booming in Gong sound. The lightning was very slender and nimble, and as if playing very near, flashes lysing two clouds above or a cloud and the earth started upon the eyes in live veins of rinsing or riddling liquid white instant jagad as if it was shivering have a bright ribbon string, which had once been kept bound round the blade and danced back into its pleating. Several strong thrills of light followed each flash, but a gray smother of finished darkness blotted the eyes. If they had seen the fork, and Tao fairy second scapes of it, were left in them. 14 minutes past nine, hire Bob last talc, a cloud charged with positive electricity unleashed a bolt of lightning towards the negatively charged Earth upon which he trod. The lightning flew from side to side, forking through the thinnest air and sought near the ground, a splendid conductor was found in a wee sliver of tungsten or Wolfram embedded by buke. In the bony core of the talismanic horn which talc carried in the breast pocket of his dashing blazer. From there, the lightning bolt zipped across town chest through one of his metal buttons down to the buckle of his belt, shot through his right leg, ankle and foot and crashed into the waiting Earth. Moments later tower to toppled to the ground. His eyes were bulging his brain was a fuzzing jelly. his limbs were at once numbed, yet quivering, twitching spastic burns stray on his flesh sizzled Hopley, his gaze fixed upon the finish heavens, he thought of musketry tickets bunny rabbit, a well fueled EEG many ping pong buke the horn marsay his songbook Chod angels adjutant penk a motorboat dappled things dim things destruction, defiance, dollar war, dust and death. He expired 14 and a half minutes past nine in the morning on the second Tuesday in July. struck by lightning on the avenue act on his way to a scientific and medical club he had joined by dint of intrigue.

Chapter nine The Undertaker was a retired football referee named Aloysius battlin, who doubled as a fishmonger. unable to afford the rent for separate premises. He ran both businesses from a single property in the town's commercial district. He collected the body of last talc before rigor mortis had set in and deposited. It deposited it on a counter at the back of the shop, where it jostle for space with a recent capture of herring, a dozen bream, a palette of blubber, knives, boning implements, wicker baskets filled with fish bones, and a platter of sturgeons in it. During the following hour, there were eight visits. Sorry. During the following hour, there were eight visitors to battleships Emporium One doctor hoist last touts general practitioner. precise details of finished health care provision at the time of these events are beyond the compass of this work, which in some ways is a pity, as it would make for fascinating reading. Dr. hoist surgery was two minutes walk from the funeral parlor, which itself stood just a few yards from the spot where talc had fallen. Aloysius battlin, who had witnessed the tragedy had himself transyl the corpse in a shop in a fish Barrow. A passing in grade was sent speeding to Dr. hoist who came at once. Medical implementer deployed, Dr. hoist pronounced his patient dead. backflip covered the body with sailcloth and suggested a prayer. He was not a religious man, said the doctor gagging on the overpowering stink of fish. But I am, replied the undertaker, and he mumbled a few words of spiritual consolation. I have an urgent case of the dropsy to attend to said Dr. hoist hurrying away, I will send you the necessary papers tomorrow to sing linate, an employee of the post office and passing acquaintance of talc, who had also witnessed his death. He entered the shop as Dr. Boyce left a typist. He unleashed from a roomy pocket in his tunic, a set of antique wooden rosary beads, and proceeded to Bray his hectically over the body, battling whose face was more gritty, muscular and northern and who feared that such a racket would deter his pissed gun customers pleaded with linnet to cease. Eyes lambent with tears linnet apologized, but explained that he was grief stricken and inconsolable. You're acting like an Italian widow's said the fishmonger Did you know The man well? heaven forfend screech linate Do you not know who you have here? He lifted the sail cloth. This is Professor Lars tauk battleship had defective vision and an unsympathetic competition. He hands on so many cadavers. He'd not thought to examine this one closely. Now he learned the identity of his charge. He was distraught. One of the finest minds in all Finland. he exclaimed. Now, perhaps you are sensible of my Whoa, settled in it. Before battleship could reply his fishmonger he assistant called him to the front of the shop, where the third visitor had appeared. Three was Baldo, Shaughnessy restaurateur, and one of battleships most valued customers. He called daily and enjoyed discussing his gastronomic schemes with the shopkeeper. Dear friend, he said, planting a trio of kisses on the fishmongers moon like tricks. To tonight,

I intend to lay on a fine meal the papal nuncio has reserved for tables, imagine I will make a fine trout pie. First, I will remove the skin and bone from a half dozen medium sized trout and cut them into small pieces. Then I will put the pieces together with a tea cup full of bland sauce for hard boiled eggs, a teaspoon full of chopped pignut pepper, salt and trimmings into a mighty iron basin. Mix the light up and place it into a thorough pastry case. I will wet the edges with goat's milk. Fold the pastry up like an envelope. Brush the top with glue, put it onto a greased tin and bake it in my piping hot oven until the pie is virtually black. Over the top I will pour syrup of herring. Oh my power is your mouth watering as mine is. It was not for slops karpin, a member of the electromagnetic operators museum committee who lived but a straightaway. He arrived some minutes after battlin had managed to bundle o Shaughnessy out of the shop. thrusting a parcel of trout under his arm. karpin came merely to gloat and did not stay long. Five poor mini she had been alerted by linate she swept through into the funeral parlor backlit and made room for her sweeping buckets of jelly mackerel head mallet and Tench bands out of the way. I would stay with you. But I must prepare the chapel of rest he said many was silent. She sat by touts bodies, scribbling notes into her commonplace book, chewing the end of her pencil each time if you paused briefly for thought, did you write a valediction to talc? a torrent of memories fire and longing. Ah, that would not be many. No, she sat by the corpse of the man with whom she had shared her life, and in her crabbed hand, wrote about chemical barometer remedies. adulterations of cocoa, I washes the time for hanging chickens, the uses of sulfuric ether, stamped document, the distance of the visible horizon furniture for invalids how to render linen bags in combustible, mangy in dogs, irritating vegetable poisons, the return of deliveries by dismissed servants, and the gutting of wigeons. Six Baptist a rich knob, a journalist, written or had bumped into Dr. hoist near the tram stop and had been apprised of talc death. She arrived panting, pumped back lip and his assistant for details, was granted a cursory sight of the corpse and scooted back to her office to file a stop press report. Professor last out the great finished polymath, was struck by lightning and killed this morning. He was 94 witnesses stated that tauk was walking along the avenue act on his way to an important meeting, when a bolt of lightning struck him down. A full of victory will appear in later editions. Seven flail plon an aeronautical engineer, he called into the shop to buy a brace of lampreys. Eight Chod his behavior was extraordinary given that he held talc in contempt. child had fallen on hard times his position as ill paid henchmen of the museum committee, belying the fact that he had once Oh, long ago, had a glittering career as a bassoonist in Java, that Ireland's finest composers had written works especially for him. One thinks of gryb Gabs wheelchair variations, dribs three winter turnips, and inevitably, the filthiest of the churns that clamorous masterpiece by lug. It had all gone horribly wrong, following a mysterious incident of the annual Jarvan bassoonists picnic in the summer of the Lugg premiere. The truth of what happened at the duck pond has never come to light, the fact hidden in moldering police files, but child's career was effectively over and as the decades passed, he became ever more embittered.

It rankled him to say a man like talc, whom he considered me Adela tant, held in such high esteem, child's loathing of talc stem from a radio broadcast given by the latter, in which he disparaged bassoonists particularly those from Java, Sumatra and Borneo as mewling gusta Snipes. The words were intemperate, the opinion indefensible, but music has long been considered as touts glaring weakness. his views were universally ridiculed, and his own works. Primarily the 114 pieces in his songbook were passed over in embarrassed silence by the musical community, except in tone deaf England, which held talks songs in curious regard. But Charles never forgave him. And when by chance, the two were brought together by the electromagnetic operators museum committee, the ex bassoonist relished every opportunity to scorn talc to his face. All the more remarkable than the vision of Chod stamping into the funeral parlor in his 10 boots, laying a bouquet of delphiniums on the sail cloth shroud, muttering console Avery nothings at the heedless scribbling Mini, and joining Aloysius battleship in the chapel of rest, offering what help he could. Working silently to men emptied out barrels of whelks, mussels and crayfish into an ion bath, which like shoved into a corner and covered with an old curtain shoulder removed oozing tubs of sprat oil from the shelves and stack them away in a cupboard battlin bundle his knives axes slices, choppers, hooks, spikes, whittles, scissors, razors, cutters and cleavers into a canvas sack, which we lowered into the cellar. Between them, they managed to hose down the slab Chod gathered handfuls of vegetation from the small plot at the back of the shop and deck the room with them, while battlin nailed a few fish crates together into a coffin shape, and placed it next to the slab ready to receive tax carcass.

obstacles for lost tax struck by lightning chapter 10. In 17, four, excuse me. We'll start again chapter 10. In 1742, jack Benny in Winslow published a book entitled, the uncertainty of the signs of death. Allah wishes battleship owned a pirated finished edition of this important work, to which you referred each time a corpse lay sprawled on the mortuary slab. It was his practice. Sorry, it was his practice not to allow weeping relatives into the chapel of rest, until he was quite sure that the body was beyond all hope of resuscitation.

Hence, he followed Winslow's advice to pour vinegar, pepper and fresh warm urine into the supposedly deceased mouth. But this was merely the first of a battery of tests he carried out. touts cadaver was subject to a panoply of often ferocious indignities backlit tweets tweaked the professor's nipples with Dr. Joe SATs formidably sharp metal pincers, shock disease with hideous shrieks and excessive noises, applied Astana tamata to his rectum. Ram burning tapers up his nostrils, melted sealing wax upon his chest depth to hammer into boiling water and pressed it into a hollow of touts abdomen, plunged Mosier, middle, Dorf, flag capric needle into his heart, stuck one of talc fingers into his ear to listen for rolling noises, carried out snarky anal sphincter test, dusted the groin with Quinton powder and injected a solution of dungaree into the spinal cord. Finally, he was satisfied and with trolled still acting as his helper, he prepared the courts for display. cleanse the body showed he said handing his assistant, a bar of soap and a mop. I will gather the substances and equipment battlin was justly proud of his embalming skills, and on one many cups and trophies from the Institute of finished sepulcher as Chod. Having completed his task wrung out the mop and a bucket, that lip plunged a trocar into taupes abdomen, just above the navel, and thrusted in all directions, until he had pierced the stomach, intestines, rectum, bladder, and liver, sucking out bits of tissue, blood clot food faces intestinal gases and urine. He then pushed the trocar through the diaphragm and into the chest lacerating and sucking as it went. pausing only just snack on a conga eel sandwich. He pumped preserving fluids into the cadaver and turned his attention to the face. When you die, your lower jaw falls downwards and backwards and the mouth hangs open giving you the look of adult or a dunda paid with childhood. His side battleship, past a needle and thread from the inner surface of touts lower lip up in front of his gums, through into one nostril, across to the other nostril and back again into his mouth behind the upper lip. When the thread was drawn tightly by a fascinated child, the lower jaw was pulled upwards and forwards. Tout looked pensive and wise and would remain so for a week or two, until his flesh began to rot. They dressed him in a winding sheet embroidered with backlit monogram leaving only his face uncovered. Then they transferred him to the coffin and lifted it onto the slab, having first covered it with a cloth of bays. And there for the next few days the great professor talc lay in state

we might just have time to pack in chapter 11. Let's see how we get on. On the day after my death the exercise book in which I have written my last will and testament will be taken to a desolate Spinney there, its contents will be screeched by my embalmer, whomsoever that may be. Those gathered to hear it will accompany the embalmer shrieks by plucking on primitive wooden stringed instruments. All those present will wear cotton hoods and go barefoot. This I command. Last town had written these words some 20 years before and published them in a small compendium of his scribblings entitled shuddering and brilliant time. Many underline the paragraph and handed a dog eared copy of the book to battlin, who read the woods with dismay. He was a fiercely shy man on the prospect unnerved him with talc in his coffin, and as he Inchon rinsed off the embalming equipment and rub their hands with finished swore fieger. He confessed his terror to his helpmeet. I cannot do it, Shawn, I'm a deeply religious man, and I have no wish to ride roughshod over these sincere wishes of the deceased, especially so eminent or thin as Professor Lars talc. But look already I am incontinent with fear Chod dabbed, backlit trousers with a cloth Thank you Chod Oh, how I shiver with apprehension at the thought of public speaking. Two years ago, when I was awarded the all Finland embalming medal, I was forced to mount the days to make an acceptance speech. sepulchral noteworthy is from throughout the land were gathered before me sitting on benches, a gong to hear my every word. The president of the Institute loop the medal around my neck, and they all cheered and applauded and through their funeral hats into the air. I was led to the microphone like a villain to the firing squad. Do not chuckle I'm serious. My mouth opened and closed repeatedly without a word issuing forth. Sweat glisten from every pore. I shattered my pantaloons, and then I swooned trolled gawped, you see, continued battlin I simply cannot do it. I would disgrace the memory of a towering Finn. I would Sally his name, there is only one answer. You will have to play my part. You will be the embalmer. After all you've given me Sterling assistance on this sad day, I asked this favor of you out of your proper respect for the departed. So it was that at noon the following day Chod sporting a false moustache and smelling appropriately of fish arrived in the desert Spinney with towels exercise books stuffed into his pocket. There were 26 souls gathered to hear touts last words, many of course, the 10 surviving members of the scientific medical club with big in tow, a bone setter named karg linnet and his wife, Allah wishes battlin heavily disguised a trio of mountain banks with whom tout could have locks his neighbor pill chain, a cat marginally widow, name unknown who was passing the spinny and stop to ponder the scene. Poor fearful Bruno slops kerbin detailed to attend by the electromagnetic netic operators museum committee, Horst vank, an old begrimed friend of touts from their student days, the journalist written up and inboard tog, a blind and foul mouthed army captain who he kept telling everybody had known tout for years, though he was Unknown to all those present, including many who deliberately crashed his toes under her black boot to stop his incessant babbling. Charles distributed the little cotton hoods which he had found next to the exercise book in talc cast iron cabinet, and at full screech all of the assembled company to remove their footwear. Mini handed out the musical instruments. Then standing atop a makeshift plank, trod thumped, summed open the exercise book and proceeded to shriek This is the last will and testament of last talc, ai Professor last talc, a thin, a polymath, author of numberless books on topics as diverse as an orthopaedic bell ringing cramp death ectoplasm fireworks, galley slaves, hat blog, roughy, Iceland jam, knuckle dusters,

With the torch of truth clutched in my fist, I lost talc, Professor of pandemonium moral exemplar I who would reek of saintliness, where there are such things as saints, which there are not, I hereby give, devise and bestow absolutely and forever in perpetuity, until the last pale flicker of animal life is stilled.
