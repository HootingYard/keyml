Come on. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank Kay. This is hooting out on the air. I realized that last month we I failed to think of us here I failed to celebrate the 14th anniversary of holding out on the air. You can listen to the first show on YouTube, actually, if you got a heating yard, there's a link to a YouTube channel in which I've grown, I'm gradually going to be posting lots of very old hooting yard on the episodes. And so far I've uploaded many, many shows that seem to survive from 2004. So should you wish to listen to them? Go to the heating yard website at hooting your.org or just go to YouTube and ask YouTube and this is called absent minded window gazing. What are we to do with the spring days that are now fast coming on? I have not thought I wouldn't need to do anything. When I arrived home I fully expected to find waiting for me on the desk in my study the traditional bottle of whiskey and loaded revolver. Together, they would take care of the immediate future, after which I need no longer concern myself with the travails of this mundane world. But I came home to find instead that control had left for me a can have sculpture and a pencil sharpener. And so now I'm sitting at my desk and gazing absentmindedly out of the window. I see the sky across which clouds ly splattered. It is many years since I read Luke Howard. And I can no longer recall all that stuff I once learned about Kimi honinbo, cirrostratus, or whatever it is, et cetera. I see grass upon which birds are hopping and slouching and preening ornithology has always confounded me. I could not tell you what manner of birds they are. I see the backs of buildings made of brick and their roofs or is it roofs. Some of the birds move in flight between the grass and the roofs or between the roofs and the grass on some of them fly away never to be seen again. And others comes to looping in possibly after exceedingly lengthy flights from distant continents. That's one thing I know about ornithology that certain birds undertake flights, the length of which we can barely imagine. Now I see lolloping along the line, old Hallam, the all too real coach and mentor of fictional athletes Bob net to evolve. He is wearing his trademark Macintosh and Homburg hat, and smoking one of his filthy cigarettes crammed with accurate Serbian tobacco in one hand is his stopwatch, which he uses when timing the fictional athlete as he runs round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round a fictional running track. I would have on the other hand is holding the hand of his walking companion or rather limping companion, the club footed plucky fascist, tot tiny Enid. She is a polka dot dressed girl of many adventures. I did not know she was in cahoots with old how old What are they up to? They stopped by a puddle, release each other's hands and stand there, like a pair of vases on a mantel piece. I gaze out of the window at them. They appear to be gazing back at me, though I cannot be sure, because I am myopic, and the window is covered in the grime of umpteen weathers. I remember reading somewhere that most birds are frightened of tiny Enid and this is borne out by the fact that all the birds that were pootling about on the grass have now flown away. Old drops the bus of his cigarette, crushes it under foot takes another gospel from the packet in his pocket, lighted and puffs.

Frank Key  05:12
This then is what we do with the spring days that are now fast coming on. We gaze out of the window vacantly fictional characters of our own imagining, we hallucinate because of course, the man is not old, how old and the girl is not tiny Enid. These are just figments in my brain with no purchase in brute reality. Outside on either side of the puzzle. The man is just any man, the girl, just any girl. And then the man has passed by, and those little girls faces quite bright. The first sentence and the last were translated from the German by women Edwin knew everything in between was not.

pansy cradle drew who you've heard on this show? Quite a few times now. Anyway, pansy. didn't believe me. When I told her that there was a film called Billy two hats. She insisted that I must be making up for my own amusement. But the researcher film a Western, made in 1974. Directed by Ted Kopp, Jeff, and starring Gregory Peck and Desi Arnaz, Jr. Ted Cod, Jeff is half Bulgarian half Canadian, and his birth name is Veliko Todd cover of Top Chef Gregory Peck you will be familiar with. His surname is the same word we use for what a bird does with its beak. When given millet, for example. The one thing I know about Desi Arnaz, Jr. is that before becoming an actor, he worked as a birdcage cleaner. I learned this from a popular best seller of the 1970s called the book of lists. While I mentioned barely two hats in conversation with pansy I have never actually seen the film. I've always thought it was the story of a cowboy with two heads, hence his two hats. There is much that a skilled screenwriter could do with such a character. His two heads could prompt either comedy or tragedy. He could be played by two actors, or using special effect by one, he might very well frighten his own horse. If the two hats barely wore a top, his two heads were wide bring cowboy hats, as in a Western, they surely would be then of necessity he would have. Sorry, then of necessity, he would have to crane each neck one significantly to the left, the other to the right, in order to avoid hat brim crash Ridge, brim crash Ridge, or worth one hat, dislodging the other hat, leaving it fallen and stranded in the dust as he rides off on his horse across the sweeping buffalo riddled plains into the sunset. As tends to happen in westerns, particularly just before the closing credits. I have often wondered if there is an autobiographical element to the film. Did Ted cod Jeff feel compelled to make it because he himself has two heads? One Bulgarian and one Canadian. I've never seen a photograph of him. So this must remain conjecture. But it would be no surprise if this were the case. There remains the question of casting. Was it intentional to have as the two lead actors who by name and past employment cannot help but make us think of birds. It's a great shame that a role was not found in the screenplay for Tippi Hedren. Tippie has only one head as far as I know, but she's a dab hand acting with birds. Belly to hat is almost certainly available on DVD which As any fool now stands for Dick Van Dyke, the cheerful chimney sweep do not appear in either belly to hat or the birds, but in a better, more charming world he would have. Perhaps he was not cast in the western, because like to be Hedren, he is a model head.

This is called fellowship. We are five friends one day we came out of the house, one after the other. First one came and placed himself beside the gate. Then the second came, or rather, he glided through the gates like a little ball of Quicksilver, and placed himself near the first one. Then came the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. We were like a five sided die. Most dice have six sides or faces I think. But we were like one of those five sided dice. You used to be able to buy it Mr. Fat sews unseemly joke shop. There is an old canard that a five sided die is a geometric impossibility. Well tried telling Matt to Mr. fatso, he will spit on your shoes and push one of his novelty spiders up your nose. We did not come out of the house voluntarily. We were turfed out, one by one by it paterfamilias several hours earlier, shortly after the Risen sun bought a blush of golden loveliness to the burgeoning de dnz. We had barged into the house purporting to proselytize. We claimed to be adept of the order of subordinate RAM and esoteric order devoted to esoteric spiritual perfection and robbery. on the pretext of converting the occupants to our cause. We hoped to Snapple items, such as kettles, cushions and coat hangers. They were a very wholesome family of four part Amar and little gas and little Gertrude. We kept them in trounced by Kate chalking and esoteric design upon the carpet, babbling incoherent yet strangely compelling gibberish and summoning from a plume of smoke, the jewel encrusted Toad god outh everything was going swimmingly until one of us I can't say who got carried away and pushed one of Mr. fats, those novelty spiders up little gasses nose is par became enraged. He was wholesome but also a champion wrestler, as big and broad as a big broad bear. See, color plate 14 in snipped picture book of bears, that will give you an idea of who we were dealing with. Or not dealing with. One by one picked us up by the scruff of the neck and kept us out of the house. We came away with nothing. Now we're gathered at the gate, the five of us like a five sided die, wondering what to do next. Let's repair to an ice cream parlor cries ringgo. I ought to explain that we are each named after a beetle. That means four of us have fixed names, while the fifth is known variously as Stu or Brian or George, the other one, or Mao or Yoko, depending upon wick lengthy and pointless bit of conjecture, gleaned from a half centuries worth of so called rock journalism is uppermost in our minds at any one time. Usually, we like to engage in lengthy and pointless arguments, particularly when it is ringgo calling the shots. But this morning, we all agree that ice cream sounds like a capital idea. After all, was it not Perkins who wrote a choc ice is always a constellation. So off, we toggle the five of us towards the nearest ice cream parlor, as the hands of the clock creep inexorably towards that position where they're both pointing in an identical decisive vertical. There is a name for that precise alignment. You can look it up in hard pangs, the positions of clock hands and their implications. As we pass a splurge of benzie poplars, one of us, I won't say who looks back and sees, springing along the line in pursuit, the jewel encrusted Toad God out. He is such a nuisance. years ago we hired him from Mr. Fat souls unseemly joke shop, thinking he would add a dash of panache to our order of Subodh Ned web capers. And he did, but he never leaves alone. When, for example, we want to go and eat choc ices. We stopped paying Mr fatto his rental fee long ago, but the toad God still follows us about. Is he a toad God, or a toad demon? No matter how much he packed his lips.

Frank Key  15:47
We push him away with our elbows. But however much we push him away. back he comes. The first sentence and the last were translated from the German by Tanja and James burn, everything in between was not.

Frank Key  16:35
There's a bulging postbag here, hooting yard. And today, nearly all the letters contained therein are asking the same question. Is there any relation between belly to hats, the girl headed cowboy I told you about a few minutes ago, and belly with the high speed cartoon character whose capers were chronicled in The Beano. Country country anxious as ever, I have looked into this matter on your behalf, and I can now present my findings. There are important differences between the two characters. Being a cowboy Billy two hats is to a large extent horse bound, whereas Billy Wiz is not. He whizzes about on his legs, though so rapidly does he make his progress through the streets and alleys and boulevards of whiskeytown that those legs are sometimes rendered barely visible. Nonetheless, it is clear that he is not sitting astride a horse. Also, in all known port rates. Belly whizzes neck supports just a single head never to. On the other hand, they have several things in common quite apart from being believed. To give one example, neither of them is ever transformed temporarily or permanently. After an encounter with a wand waving wizard dusk by the edge of an eerie Marsh into a magic chicken. Or to be piercingly accurate, there is at least no surviving record of such a poultry transformation or pulp formation, as it is termed in the literature. Believe me, I've scoured the records and come up with nothing. One of the wrestlers in the postbag asks, Can you be quite sure, Mr. Key to the umpteenth degree of certainty that neither Barry two hats nor ways on horseback Sorry, can you be quite sure Mr. Key to the umpteenth degree of certainty that neither two hats Norway's on horseback or at high speed was aboard the airship l Zed 129. Hindenburg when it burst into flames during its attempt to dock with its moring mast Naval Air Station lakehurst. in Manchester Township, New Jersey, on the sixth of may 1937. To withdraw I must confess that no, I cannot be 100% certain, because I've not studied in detail, the passenger manifest. I will say, however, that I think it most unlikely received nearly a summary of my findings. For the full report bulked out with footnotes, illustrations, diagrams, dependencies, and a bit of sandpaper sent 10 shillings and sixpence to me at the usual address. Mark your envelope with an unseemly stain roughly the same shape as a matter of Uruguay or any other South American country of your choosing or any other country. One of the other continents alliterative which can be obtained by sending me even more money in the form of non transferable gilt bonds drawn on an important International Bank.

Frank Key  20:32
So, you're probably sitting there thinking obsessively about Billy to hats and Barry weighs so to take your mind off them. Here is a riddle. My first is in Blenkinsop, but not in Xavi a cougar. My second is increased greater, but not in thurible. My third is in collapsed lung but not in owl. By fourth is in Petula Clark, but not in puff pastry. My whole past is beyond all human understanding. What am I

Frank Key  21:41
she's cold advocate. I was not at all certain whether I had any advocate. I could not find anything definite about it. Every face was unfriendly. Most people who came towards me and whom I kept meeting in the corridors looked like fat old women. They had huge blue and white striped aprons covering their entire bodies kept stroking their stomachs and swaying awkward awkwardly to and fro. I had been told that at least three advocates would be assigned to represent me, but if so, where were they? And could the case proceed without them? I wondered if I had somehow come to the wrong building. Perhaps this was not the law court, but some other branch of some other institution or some other regime in some other country or some other continent. After all, there was a blank period of several hours between my waking up on my pallet of straw in the barn annex, and my arrival here, several hours of which I could remember nothing save for the plaintive cry of a curfew, and a smashed saucer on the linoleum. dizzy in the head, I sat down on a bench and lit my pipe. People continued to mince and waddle along the corridor, seemingly with purpose. None of them spared me a glance. None of them announced themselves as my advocate. Perhaps I was in the right building, but on the wrong floor. I had noticed as I entered from the street, that the building was impossibly tall. The top of it was invisible, engulfed by clouds puffing on my pipe ought to have car my nerves, but like pour neddie in brand upon the brain guy Matt in 2006. I was a bundle of ticks. The case if I were ever if it were ever heard and judged upon, could spell my ruin. I had been accused of plagiarism by the publishers of the weekly children's comic, the hammer of Christ. Among the most popular strips in that Penny woeful was that recounting the adventures of busta and red board, I was deemed to have stolen these characters when I began to issue my own weekly children's comic, Busta and red board. It was true that in all particulars, my Buster was identical to the original buster, my red board to the original red board, and that some Well, all of the adventures I related in my comic deferred not a drop from adventures pursued by Buster and red board in the hammer of Christ. But apart from those wildly improbable coincidences, and is it not a feature of coincidences that they're wild and improbable? there really was no parison the paper size and pagination of the comics was different. My drawings were somewhat cack handed, and the sale price of my publication was four times the price of the dreadful rag I was accused of copying. In spite of this, and of my protestations of innocence, I had been summoned to the Court to face the full Wrath of the law. But how could I mount Marshall a defense without my promised advocates slumped on the bench. It dawned on me that my predicament was not dissimilar to a situation faced by busta and redboard and one of their adventures, which had appeared in the hammer of Christ, volume 44 number eight, and coincidentally, in busta and redboard Volume One number one. What happened was that the frolicsome guru was summoned to the law court, an impossibly tall building, the top of which vanished in the clouds. They had to answer a charge brought against them, the essence of which was that they were false replicas or doppelgangers of the purported real Buster and real rad board. It is a stupendously exciting and suspenseful story, as the pair roam the corridors on the many, many, many floors of the building, knowing that at any moment, they may come face to face with themselves. Particularly enthralling and psychologically complex for children's comic strip is Buster and ride Bob's grubbing realisation, that they may not be real, may be simply fictional two dimensional simulacra complexity piled on paradox, because of course, neither Buster nor ride bodies real that comic strip characters, but so are the so called real Buster and red board they will encounter at some point in the story in the building in a corridor on a floor.

Frank Key  26:45
Somehow, these reflections made my own situation less fraught. I tapped out my pipe rose from the bench and went in search of my advocates, it seemed to me now that I would be able to spot them easily among the teaming throng, they would look identical to me, all three of them, I handed them along the corridors on the floor, and then I tried the other corridors on the other floors, one by one. But before I found my advocates, I noticed a curious thing about the many steep and crowded staircases in this building. As long as you don't stop climbing the stairs. As long as you don't stop climbing, the stairs will end under your climbing feet, they will go on growing upwards. And in that case, the first sentence and the last word translated from the German by Tammy and James Stern, and everything in between was not. And that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week, possibly with pansy cradle group possibly to talk about belly to hats again. Bye bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:19
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans of nerds who wanted to touch my kids. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
