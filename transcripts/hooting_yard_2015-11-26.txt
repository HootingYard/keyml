Good evening. This is resonance follow 4.4 FM My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. London's most fabulous art radio stations. most fabulous spoken word, pros. Berg Billings program. It's lovely, isn't it? I haven't been here for a couple of weeks I've been either in Cornwall or ill. You decide. I don't know if you heard that john doe said basically the same thing. Being in Cornwall and being ill, basically Anyway, you decide. I'm going to start reading something instead of burbling. Ordinarily, when we think of harpies, we think of Aiello, Aussie Pete and caviar, no. I've probably pronounced those wrong. I'm going to start again, and I'll probably pronounce him in the same way, but I really don't know how they're pronounced properly. Ordinarily, when we think of harpies, we think of as co authored patay. And Severiano, or actually is sometimes known Paul Dodge, the three sisters of Greek myth, Byrd women, who kept stealing and befouling food from Phineas, and were generally vicious, violent and cruel. Tennyson called them, these prodigies of myriad naked nurses, and twisted shapes of last unspeakable abominable, strangers at my heart, not welcome, harpies. miring every dish, but that may be more a reflection of the poet, fevered mental state than of the destructive wind spirits themselves.

the rim of cooking vessels in ancient Greece, by DAX blieb, the notorious children's writer and historian who wrote from his cell in a big forbidding prison, perched on a promontory, where he was incarcerated for life after causing a series of railway disasters. The book spurred the tiny girl's imagination, but it was not as if hers was a humdrum childhood. both of her parents were vampires, or be it were fairly nondescript variety. Not for them remote castles and sweeping black capes and glistening crystal decanters from which to pour the blood they drank. Mr. And Mrs. kamboj were lowly sought, reduced on occasion to squeezing the last drop of gore from a fly or a blue bottle Thrax with a rolled up periodical, something of a wash strong bitrix his father tried to put it about that he was the eponymous fiend in Charles Ives is Psalm slugging a vampire 1902. So, this was clearly twaddle. His only tenuous connection with the composer being a brief tenure, Hawking pencils and pencil sharpeners on the ferry, across the whose atonic Stockbridge. By the time Beatrix was born, the cam Rogers had moved far, far from the Housatonic fetching up in a village that was scarcely more than a clump of unsightly wooden shed a village so remote and dilapidated, that it did not even have a name. There is a surprising number of employment opportunities in such a godforsaken spot for a while strolling his wife, who would shrivel to dust at the first ray of sunlight come the door, although I can't for the life of me think what they might be. I puzzled over this, and a kind friend suggested to me that perhaps the Cambodia's made a living by creeping around at night laying traps for moles and badges and weaseled. So let us assume that that is what they did. And that farmers they're about paid them well for their exertions that would at least explain how they came to be able to afford to send the young bitrix to a finishing school somewhere in the Habsburg Empire, where she first encountered the works of DAX blieb and set her heart on becoming a harpy. She had wanted to be a bird, she learned that as the child of vampires, she could never ever be transformed into a Starling, or a limit, or a night jar or a gnat patch, nor even into a bufflehead or a crow. It was a cruel lesson, but she did not let it crush her spirit. Instead, she spent hours with the finishing school seamstress up in that weird, cold, crooked, beamed dusty style attic, stitching and stitching. Until she had fashioned for herself, a pair of bright resplendent wings, with a span so wide when fully unfold that the old seamstress gave a gasp and swooned clattering to the floor, more like a pile of dry sticks than a body of flesh and blood. And in her heart, the heart bitrix exalted at her power. She would have liked to fly away from the school by launching herself from the rooftops, but she was a sensible girl. She removed her wings and folded them up and stuck them in a pity bag and carried on with the day through lessons in department and watercolor and Piccolo and pastry finesse and recital of 20 verses by back blieb and only when the time came for the afternoon embroidery lesson. Did she flit away through a side door and off into the mountains, while the staff and pupils went scurrying in search of their seamstress, now stumbling, stunned and blinded about the attic, bashing into mannequins and tearing her paper taut skin On scattered Needles and Pins she could no longer see.

And Beatrix wondered in the mountains, stretching her taffeta and organdy wings striking fear into cow herds and their cows. Stories of the flightless bird woman circulated in the taverns. to persuade her Roth offerings of food were left for her in huts and shelters and hermitages. Sometimes reckless young pups armed themselves with their father's rifles, and strode up into the foothills, trying not to choke on the tobacco pipes they clenched between their immaculate drawers or bluster and braggadocio, hot for hobby hunting. Beatrix, by now had perfected a shriek of such ferocity, the blood of those who heard it could have provided her vampire parents with plenty of ice popsicles, experimenting on the cows and cow herds. She had learned that a few energetic flapping of her wings, accompanied by her shriek could keep her safe from harm. Each and every gun toting young fool who came in her pursuit, returned to his village shriveled and slobbering and deranged. Most of them had to be locked away in gloomy cellars, their families shameful secret, quietly fed on slops for years and years, and never spoken of again. Perhaps they were the lucky ones for their village pals, who were strewed the Harpy hunt for one reason or another, was soon to perish in the trenches, the Great War doing for them what it did for the Habsburg Empire in which they had grown. And it was the end of that terrible conflict, that biktrix kamboj at last came down from the mountains, and made her way vaguely and without any real purpose across war torn lands, until one bright day in 1921. She fetched up on the key side of hooligans Wharf, and there she stayed.

We'll continue with the story of Beatrix cambodge the key side harpy. Beatrix realized soon enough that she inspired not one whit of terror in the rattled and retired old sea dogs who haunted the key side. These were ancient and crusty mariners who chewed fish heads when they were not downing tankards of salt, water and Grog, and most, and most of them had seen things far more terrifying than bitrix in their years upon the high seas. pegleg Pinsent for example, over 100 years old, with Brian for blood, who now slumped, collapsed and crapped in a key side kiosk, were thought to have seen so many ship ghosts, that he shook still, as he'd been shaking for 90 years or more. Ever since, as a callow cabin boy, he had clambered into the crow's nest of the HMS corrugated cardboard to be confronted with a sea soaked ghoul, which intoned a dreadful litany of in comprehensible maritime twaddle into his innocent ear. The goal was spindly, it pulsated like a jellyfish. It gave off an odor of barnacles and rotten death, and it loomed above the tiny boy. It's boneless yet bony seeming fingers clutching at his sleeve, leaving a trail of slime, which no amount of soaking in pile after pile of borax Boiling water would ever expand. At the end of that first voyage, the young Pinsent took the tunic home to his mom, supposing her laundry skills equal to any and every stain, Google smeared or otherwise, and that good woman let for a shirt with a shriek or shriek compared to which bitrix is harpy How was like the song of the nightingale she had as an infant wanted to be. I Young Miss croaked pegleg Pinsent as bitrix sheltered in his kiosk, during a rainstorm on her first day on the key side, I saw many airship ghosts, and I saw ghost ships to I saw shapes in the night sky that should not have been there, and heard wailings and screams emerging from the depth, and I smell things no sailor or to ever smell and touched what no sailor ought ever tuck. And all of that on my very first voyage missed nine years old, and plying the foul lotions on the corrugated cardboard. Now then, Mr. Pinsent, said Beatrix, balancing a dainty cup tea cup on her lap. For harpy Vogue, she was she had not forgotten her Habsburg finishing school manners. You have spoken of eldritch experiences involving four of the senses. But what of the fifth? Did you ever taste something no sailor or ever taste as you would put it, actually pose this question. She unfold one winner little just to see if it had any effect on the Ancient Mariner, whose beard seemed to be alive with tiny crawling forms of marine life, not easy to identify. He did not pay her wing any attention, as he replied, hard tack biscuit riddled with worms myth. That was my diet, then as it is my diet now, he said. So the answer to your question has to be no, I suppose. I see, said Beatrix demurely sweeping from her lap. The crumbs of a cake he had bought at a neighboring kiosk actually did so she flapped her one unfold wing with a certain eerie menace, and prepared to display the second pegleg Pinsent took no notice. Failure was lost and shaking in Google reverie, occasionally slurping from a tin tumbler of ROM or brine, or ROM and Brian, he could not tell anymore.

The interview petered out polite beer tricked thank the old sea dog for his time and shelter, and must his filthy hair before striding out onto the key side, deep in thought. Clearly hoppy dumb had failed to discombobulate the grizzled marine person. It was true, she had not sad shriek at him, but with his long experience of sea shrieking she demised that his composure would have remained on rattled. night fell on Oh hooligans Wharf on that Wednesday, and a fact shimmering stars bitrix huddled down under a greasy green tarpaulins she found abandoned as a stretch of the key side where orcs and skewers gathered. Far from the hectic Tavern raucous with shanties. She took off her wings and folded them into her Pipi bag and placed it as a pillow and lay down among birds lulled to sleep, by the waves lapping against the rotting and crooked timber of the jetty. She dreamed harpy dreams, ferocious and merciless and demented. She stole food from kings who are displeased their gods. descending into the infernal regions, she sank her savage talents into the bellies of suicides. She tormented, unhappy sinners bound for Tartarus. She luxuriated in the filth and stench of her Island nest. And when she woke up on Thursday morning, the orcs and skewers had flown away, and she was alone on the key side, her wings packed in her pants. She jumped into the sea and swam elegantly as she had been taught to do at finishing school. And then she climbed out and shook herself and preened like a sea bird on a rock. And you retrieved her TV bag and put on her wings and shrieked and shrieked, and then she parted off along the key side towards the crumbling ruinous heart, where a signboard promised breakfast, and she sat down at a rickety wooden table, its surface smeared with the slime of a ship's ghoul, surrounded by sea dogs in tatty. unraveling sweaters, stiff with wax, their rubber boots squelching and leaking, and she tapped into a breakfast of cockles and mussels and herring, and lobster and squid boiled water from a tide pool. Her cup alive with tiny wriggling marine beings, somehow happier at home here so far from her finishing school in the mountains of what once had been the Habsburg Empire.

I'm what should they know of potatoes who only potatoes No, asks Dobson in the title of one of his pamphlet, which is sadly out of print. It's a dazzling tour de force noted for containing an eerily accurate description of crinkle cut oven chips written before such things existed. It is worth noting that the dazzling nature of the pamphlet is less to do with the quality of Dobson's prose, which might better be described in this instance as hysterical and incoherent. And more to do with the then fashionable far out groovy psychedelic typeface, employed by marigold to when setting the text. Indeed, so dazzling is the appearance of the multicolored swirly miles drum of type. That one is advised to wear sunglasses when reading it or attempting to read it. Peter Hitchens has claimed not without reason that marigold crew was probably high on pot when producing the pamphlet. But she also may have thought that it's far out groovy psychedelic look would increase sales in headshops and free festivals and other such excrescences of the era. If so, she was horribly mistaken for the potato pamphlet, as it's commonly known, sold only half a dozen copies in toto. And three of those went to a wandering proto crusty, who pitched his tent in Dobson's back garden for the duration of the Summer of Love. The pamphleteer himself might also have been high on pot when he wrote the text for as I said, his prose is hysterical and incoherent. We the wannabe Dobson just would have tossed the pamphlet aside or even set it on fire, but I'm adamantine in my devotion to the great man, so I enrolled in a special study group. each weekday evening for three whole years, we met in an abandoned pavilion to pour over the pamphlet eight of us, trying as best we could to eke some sense from it. What follows their noses much to the contributions of Messrs clapper shrub black in spirit squelch. Dale Winton, Boggess and gloob. As to my own insights Dobson seems to have conceived of the idea of the crinkle cut oven trip as the knight Plus Ultra of space age food. This he says, describing event imaginary frozen sliver of reconstituted potato based mush shaped with some sort of wiggly shaped drinks slicer will be the staple food store. Have spiced tribalism, cosmonauts, as they venture through galaxies yet unknown. He asks if any alien beings they might meet would comprehend that the crinkle cut oven clip and the ordinary potato, a tuberous vegetable buried in soil back on planet Earth, were in any way related to each other. And he answers no to that question. No matter he said how advanced and hyper intelligent the beings were, they would never be able to grasp the human ingenuity that turned one into the other. Dobson posits the idea that it's the potato that has evolved from the crinkle cut oven chip, rather than vice versa. And in a prescient passage, written some years before Stanley Kubrick's film 2001 A Space Odyssey, he invents a scene where a primitive ape picks up a crinkle cut oven chip and toss it into the air where it is suddenly transformed into a potato. annoyingly Dobson does not specify the variety of potato, or perhaps he does, and we were simply incapable of deciphering a particularly far out groovy psychedelic section of the text. Quite what point is trying to make with this topsy turvy toggle is unclear, even when one is high on pot. I speak not in my own experience, but that of Messrs squelch and glob, who often huddled together in the corner of the abandoned pavilion before our study group meetings, indulging in what I think is in some circles known as reefer madness, for all that, and what should they know of potatoes, who only potatoes know, is a fascinating Curio. Dobson does actually answer the question posed in the title, but in doing so, raises a blizzard of further questions, the answers to which perhaps will not become apparent until the true space age is upon us.

And that little ones is the end of today's show. I'll leave you with a very short extract from Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives the book which you can buy in all good book shops, and a copy of which I have it on very good authority, unimpeachable authority. Rest as we speak on the coffee table of no less a person than now will Edmunds. How he got a copy. I know not why he got a copy. I know not when maybe because he's a bit upset that he's not in the book. Someone who is in the book is Robert Francis Kennedy, American politician 1925 to 1968. Bobby Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy's household pets included three dogs, plus ponies, horses, geese, a Burro, a Ceylon, Hungarian pigeons, 20, goldfish, rabbit, turtles, and a salamander. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
