Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I'd like to begin this week. Join me if you would, in a brief thought for world peace. Thank you. We did that to celebrate as our as our hooting yard. birthday gift for Yoko Ono. 77 years old today. And sure, Yoko will be very pleased with that plea for world peace. Anyway, happy birthday Yo, Colin. Now we can put that particular utopian wishful thinking on the back burner for another year and get on with the show. This is to statements of particulars from William Tell. My name is William Tell and I am an archer of repute. Like Caspar Badr at the hotelier who pioneered winter sports. I am a man of Switzerland, country of chocolates, which role and neutrality. My son Walter has a large head, and as he lopped along the mountain path, it tilted upon his neck and swung from side to side, he had become an object of ridicule among the goat herds. My wife, Coco delved into ancient books to see if she could discover a spell to shrink Walters head. I was fully supportive of this strategy, and entered many crossbow tournament, the idea being to win prize monies, so Coco could afford to buy more and more ancient books. Though I won contests in every canton of Switzerland, and even abroad in Italy, where they called me Guglielmo, and our chalet was piled high with ancient books. Cocoa failed to discover an effective spell. Walter became low spirited and unusually cantankerous. I feared for my coop of hens, towards which my son began to matter animate versions, he was projecting his inner turmoil against harmless poultry, a psychological commonplace, goat herds are larger and violent when threatened. Desperate, I sought advice from the Swiss Institute of deportment, I was told that the muscles in Walters neck could be strengthened rather than his head shrunk. The way to do this was to make him carried pieces of fruit balanced atop his crown. That goes some way to explaining why Walter had an apple on his head when her man gessler, the Austrian Volk of altdorf, came riding by on his horse by every alpin, Switzerland, how I hated the Volk. I shot the apple off Walter's head with my crossbow to show gessler that I was not a man he should mess with. I had a pomegranate in my pocket, and was about to balance it on guestlist head when I was apprehended by his henchmen. To his credit, my quick thinking some unlatch the hens from the coop and set the fear of God into them. He pointed at the henchmen and yelled, kill, they immediately unhandled me and fled alongside their vocht of altdorf. Inside the chalet, Coco had brewed a potion from a recipe in one of the ancient books. Walter took a sip and spat it out, but I drank an entire goblet full. Shortly afterwards, I lost touch with reality. My name is William towel, and that is my statement. I cannot vouch for its accuracy, as the potion is still coursing through my veins. I must now go and tell everything I know about Switzerland to a man named Ruskin, who says he is writing a book about this fair country. second statement of particulars of William Tell

Frank Key  04:37
my name, excuse me, my name is William towel, and I am an archer of repute. much of my time is spent hiking the 26 cantons of my Swiss homeland, firing arrows from my crossbow, that which presents itself to me as an appropriate target in a single morning to give an example between breakfast First and 11th is I might shoot it a rampaging wild Swiss bore a hench person of the Austrian vocht of outdoors or an orchard fruit. So accurate is my marksmanship. I have been known to balance on Apple on my son's head, take a considerable number of paces away from him, turn, aim and splice the apple into with a lethal wood and metal missile without harming a hair on Walters abnormally large head. Walter is my son's name. Despite the size of his head, I have not yet tried to balance either a wild Swiss boar or hench person on it. That sort of thing would probably delight a circus crowd between turns by clowns and performing seals and that times of harvest failure. When the tail chalet is short of food. I have considered it. Walter would have to be persuaded to wear some kind of brace of metal and leather to support his neck and his back. And I can foresee problems in so persuading him for his very fashion conscious quite a dandy In fact, though, just now it has occurred to me that slaying the United States President JFK or a back brace throughout his 1000 days in office, without the citizenry being aware of the fact I must point that out to Walter as reassurance Should I decide to go down the circus performing route next time the tells go hungry. Over the years, I have fired arrows for my crossbow in all 26 Swiss cantons, including those which were once officially half cantons, but I have not shorted orchard fruit, whether balanced on Walters large bonds or not in each and every one. consulting my records I see that no fruit has been in my crossbow site in ob vowden zog solothurn or Segovia, I must rectify these emissions from a determined Archer and a completist. I still remember the afternoon I was finally able to place an X against Ticino in my handwritten can't on list. There I was in the market square bellinzona the capital my heart swelling with pride as a hardy band of my Italian speaking countrymen cheered their gugliotta motel to the rafters. The rafters were those of a temporary wooden structure, erected for my display of archery skills for wild Swiss balls had been captured in net by tough and fearless hunters. One bore tied to each wooden corner post and I had shot them with my crossbow, one after another spinning around with the grace of a ballerina. Walter was a babe in arms at the time, the arms being those of my wife, Coco, who watched my feet of bull slaughter with crossbow from a safe distance, sitting on a bench at the edge of the market square outside a butcher shop selling spicy Italian eight sausages. When my third statement of particulars is do I plan to say a few words about sausages in Switzerland, my son Walter will be a great help for he his apprentice to a butcher in our home village in the canton of Arry the butcher was at first alarmed by Walters gigantic head, but when he learned that his papaya was the legendary Archer William Tell, his ecstasy was such that it rival that of the woodcarver diner, as documented in Verner Hertzog in 1974 film. Steiner, of course, is a man of Switzerland, a skiing Ace, and his first name is Walter. I like to think he was named after my son, but I have not had an opportunity to question his parents on the matter. But as I said, I'm a determined Archer and I will Winkle out the truth even if I have to tie the woodcarver steiners papa and mama to the corner posts of a temporary wooden structure in the market square like Canton capital, and take aim at them with my crossbow primed and ready to fire.

It's not I think, generally known that the notorious killer babinski was also a man of letters. So the imminent publication of the complete and staggeringly voluminous correspondence of the tour. As killer babinski in no fewer than 40 volumes is to be welcomed babinski It seems when he could tear himself away from the committal of blood drenched enormities wrote dozens upon dozens of letters every day to a bewildering number of correspondents, some of whom actually replied. An unexpectedly high proportion of his letters are on the subject of moles, and are scant interest as a general reader. Although no doubt those as mole dazed as babinski will find much to interest them. But the great fascination of these huge fat volumes lies in the very occasional letters written by babinski, which address wider topics. Those of us who've long wanted to know more about the lumbering murderous walrus mustache psychopaths are well served by this excellent collection can consider this for example, dearest Todd, or possibly Tad or Ted, that Minsky's handwriting was atrocious. I'm currently hiding in a cave by the mighty pitiless sea. Can you do me a favor and bring me a goat so I can slaughter it with my bare hands and eat it raw? The very next day before he has received a reply bubinski rights to Todd again. Beloved Todd, is there such a thing as a goat suitable for vegans, one made out of marzipan or no egg and sewage substitute. It clear slipped my mind when I wrote to you yesterday that I have decided to issue all animal products. While I take a distinct pleasure and act of sickening violence, such as the blister lane post office horror of a few months ago, I would not wish to hurt her hair on a fly's head. I am not entomologist enough to know whether flies actually have any hair on their head. But my point I hope is clear. When I am brought before the tribunal of beasts in a dingley Dell like something out of a hex painting, I want to be able to hold my head high and pre my walrus mustache and cry. I vowed when hiding in a cave by the sea never again to harm a single animal nor each one and I have kept my promise obese and survived on lettuce and radishes and many types of fruit and marzipan goats. I will be very grateful if you can sort something out toward because the night is drawing in and the waves are crashing on the rocks and I'm getting quite peckish. Elsewhere bubinski can strike a supply a surprisingly plaintive tone. Did this spleen Boy, you will probably be surprised at my plaintive tone, but I have been sobbing quite bitterly. I have had to take refuge in a layer in the blue forgotten hills because I learned that the coppers wanted to have a word with me about the gruesome slayings at sawdust bridge. I am woebegone and emotional and have pins and needles in various limbs as I have all here in the darkness, listening to the grunting and Hollings of creatures of the night, some of which might discover my layer and attack your poor tearful babinski what is to become of me? Fortunately, we know from other sources what became a babinski after that, even if we did not a letter he wrote some Three weeks later, shed some light hyzer.by now you might have heard about the coppers who were found dead in a pit in the blue forgotten hills, they had turned inside out by some inexplicable act of violence. Well, when they do the forensics, it will be my great grubby thumbprint they'll find, but what do I care? I fled the scene as a gas bear last, and I'm now quite safe holed up in a seaside boarding house plotting an enormity at the docks. If you could see your waiter stuffing some flies into an envelope and sending them to me that would be grand babinski does not state why he wants an envelope stuffed with flies. It may form part of his plot or perhaps he's just being enigmatic as he is in this later letter also addressed to dot

Frank Key  14:24
dear dot, I've been thinking for some time now that you have signally failed to realize just how enigmatic I am. This grieves me. You really need to appreciate that when I'm not committing gore splattered killings or keeping up with my mole correspondence. I'm just about the most enigmatic person you're ever likely to receive a letter from. Note for instance, this exquisite note paper its edges trimmed with pinking shears it's lavender and cauliflower scent and the way I have folded it so that if you cut along the creases, you will have 16 pieces which could be formed into a lifelike paper model of David Blunkett guide dog, complete with harness, PS, many thanks for sending the envelopes stuffed with flies so promptly. I made very very enigmatic use of it so enigmatic I'm not going to tell you in order to preserve my considerable Mystique. At other times babinski was more forthcoming about his activities. In a letter to David Blunkett, he wrote, Dear Mr. Blunkett, I would have you know that recently, I think creating lifelike paper models of your guide dog complete with harness. If you would, like one, please let me know and I will send the template by return of post unless of course I'm forced to flee for my current hidey hole deep in the woods, sheltered by Stark pines and majestic Kala Burnham's Everything is fine at the moment. But there is always the possibility that I might betray my presence to the wisdom of old woodcutter who dwells in a hovel a few yards away. And he looks like the sort who would summon the coppers. They think I had something to do with the unspeakable strangling in pointy town last October, which I did, of course, but who's to know I keep it on the hat Mr. Blunkett if you have a hat, which I'm sure you do, being a man of style and substance. That Minsky's own style and substance were occasionally to be found in foreign parts now and then he sailed across the mighty and pitiless sea when say, the police were hot on his trail, or he had in mind to carry out some foreign killings, or he wish to familiarize himself with the ways of foreign moles. at these times, he kept up his correspondence with gusto, although he had to make use of airmail and therefore of thin air mail note paper, of which he did not approve. My darling blood when I'm sure you will agree that this airmail paper is far too thin. I have a good mind a scrunchie, topping my big hairy fist and then to calm myself down by going out and setting upon a foreign person and visiting upon them an unimaginably horrible and violent death, possibly involving pincers and bleach. Why can't they make the aeroplanes bigger so they can carry thicker paper. If I wasn't lying low from the pilot sigh I would march into a larger important building and demand something was done. But I need to keep out of sight and the snowdrift outside this remote chalet so deep that I would leave telltale tracks. Even if I just pop down to the jolly goat herds hat to abduct one of his goats. thank Christ I put all that vegan nonsense behind me. I will have some explaining to do when I'm hauled before the tribunal of beasts, but I will hope to distract them by allowing the gentle breeze in the dingley Dell to waft wine walrus mustache to startling effect that worked for me before when I was about to be arrested for the cuxhaven poisonings, those cuxhaven coppers were so bowled over by the elegant quivering of my moustache that I was able to make my way make my getaway across the sandbanks. babinski did not always escape arrest of course, and an entire volume of the collected correspondence is entitled letters from prison. Here is one of them. Dear Yoko, I was born free, but now I am in chains. Please take out full page advertisement in all the major newspapers demanding my immediate release alongside whatever else you might wish for, such as world peace or no possessions. We both know that you have global influence, and it will be a terrific boost to your moral fiber to use that influence on behalf of a wretched prisoner like me. So get with the program this is this was not the only letter in which babinski babbled about the boosting of fiber. It is a topic he returned to again and again.

Frank Key  19:17
Dearest Ludovico, I've got some fiber here, and I'm going to give it a boost. If you want to watch meet me behind the gasworks dead of night, you will be able to recognize recognize me by dint of my walrus mustache, lumbering gait, the blood of a freshly slaughtered goat dribbling down my chin, and my general air of seizing psychopathic violence. Don't tell anybody you're coming and don't make any plans for tomorrow or indeed for the rest of your life, which I can assure you is going to be particularly nasty, brutish, and short. PS Give my regards to your delightful wife and seven lovely children. It is not often babinski allows himself as here to show his tender sentimental side. One of the pleasures of this extraordinary collection is that we get to see the notorious killer in the round, wat more warts and even more warts. The warts Of course were usually hidden under that majestic mustache, as he wrote to the TED or Todd or Tad we met earlier. Dear Todd, I feel I must let you know that my warts are mostly hidden under my majestic walrus mustache forever yours babinski. Somehow, those words can serve as an epitaph of sorts.

The trustage just gone was Shrove Tuesday, Pancake Day Of course. Dobson adored Pancake Day. Every year in the weeks leading up to Shrove Tuesday. He grew ever more hot brained and excitable gathering sacks of flour, carrying out repeated or William egg counts and begging old farmer frack for turns of milk from the Mad old rustic cow collection every year to he revised polished embroidered and sometimes even rewrote from scratch his pamphlet, pancakes, food of the gods out of print. In the complete Dobson bibliography, this title appears both with and without a question mark. Like Sidney and Beatrice Webb's factory was Soviet communism, a new civilization, written in 1935 at the height of Stalin's terror, which lost its question mark between its first and second editions. Why Dobson ever phrased his title as a query in the first place is unfathomable, for he was absolutely convinced that all divine beings subsisted on pancakes and nothing else. a glance at any sacred text or compendium of myths quickly disproves the pamphlet is theory, if we can call it that, though, delusional Day Fix would express it better. Dobson spent a preposterous amount of time working his way through the foundational texts of all major religions. Tip maxing out all mentions of foodstuffs, and as soon as the tip X was dry, scribbling in the word pancakes at one point, the commission Rex tint, the noted mezzotint is to create a mezzotint, showing the Greek gods atop Mount Olympus, stuffing their faces with pancakes. Their work was never completed, or even began, because Dobson wanted to pay the mezzotint just in eggs, flour and milk. And Rex tinned famously was a cash only mezzotint test. It comes as something of a surprise to learn that in spite of his enthusiasm, Dobson was a hopeless pancake maker. He could never get the mixture quite right, and his tossing technique was laughable. He tried to divert attention from his pancake ineptitude, sort of a combination of bluster, weeping and pointing out of the window at an imaginary flock of calf injuries, only late in his life to be face up to the truth in the remarkable pamphlet, my pancake ineptitude, a heart rending confession in 16 burst of hallucinatory prose out of print. In the 16th, and final text, Dobson makes his most compelling case for the divine nature of this simple element. Though the prose is so hallucinatory, that not even the most diligent pancake focused reader can work out what in heaven's name he is babbling on about. In some cultures is traditional, for uncaged day to take place shortly after Pancake Day, on uncaged day, sacks of flour a hidden away behind wooden partitions. Egg remain uncounted and ignored in their nests and cartons and milk from cows is used instead to make pap or slops for the benefit of bedridden invalid. No pan may be used for the making of a cake on pain of excommunication from whichever face one professors or execution By the severing of one's head, or the ripping of one's heart, bloody and throbbing from one's chest, depending on the savagery of that faith. It has been said by clunk among others, that the savagery of a religious tradition is in direct correlation to its cake dogmas, worldly minded cardigan wearing followers of we the milk soft face will have few if any prohibitions on the eating of cake, including the pancake that most panni of all cakes. Such vapid belief systems also use cases or celebrate every foodstuff at every opportunity, rather than acknowledging its numinous quality by restricting cakey joy to one or two days a year, as the barbaric and blood drenched religions do. In a certain light when cooked just so a pancake resembles a miniature edible sum. That surely tells us all we need to know.

Very briefly, this week, something I learned from a book by Rebecca Jenkins about the London Olympics. Nowadays, if I understand these things correctly, long distance runners rehydrate themselves by glugging lots of water during a race. Such namby pamby methods were alien to the Dowty amateurs who ran the 26 mile marathon at the 1980 Olympic Games in London. Among their refreshments along the route, were muscatel grapes carves foot jelly with lemon, new laid eggs soaked in tea, orange segments, Brandy, champagne, and small doses of strychnine. And I'll leave you with that thought. back next week. Bye, bye. Oh, one last thing. This show was dedicated to Eric. So Eric, I'm not sure if Eric was listening. But apart from being Yoko Ono's birthday, the show is also especially dedicated to Eric. Yes, so that's it. I remember to do that. And that's, that is now the end. Bye bye.
