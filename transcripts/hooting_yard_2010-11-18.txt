Good evening. This is indeed resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And Monday this coming Monday marks the 47th anniversary of the assassination of john F. Kennedy. So, here is a craft project to keep you occupied over the weekend. Hello, listeners. I'm going to show you how to make a lovely scale model of Dealey Plaza, the site in Dallas, Texas, of the Kennedy assassination on the 22nd of November 1963. First, get some plasticine. Before removing the packaging, wash your hands thoroughly in warm water. If your hands are really grubby, for instance, if you have been doing grubby things use swore fieger I'm making no moral judgment on your indulgence in grubby practices. Merely noting that warm water by itself will not suffice to cleanse the pollution from your fleshly extremities. As for your immortal soul, Fabius for me to pronounce upon the peril in which it is placed by your unconscionable grumpiness. After all, I am no saint. That being said, I aboard the kind of Grubin as to which you have fallen prey, or be it I do not make it my business to go about declaring my own rectitude, for that would be to boast and thus itself sinful. Once or twice, maybe I have dipped my toe in the slimy puddle of moral turpitude and that was quite enough for me. Now to the second stage of this exciting project, with your prayer book or catechism resting upon the work surface in easy reach, open the packet of plasticine. In tone, three Hail Marys, break off some plasticine and begin to molded into the shape of the grassy knoll. It is advisable at this point to go and fetch your rosary beads. Before completing the grassy knoll part of the model, open up that tin of small finger and clean your hands again, you can never be too careful when you've made a possible model of the grassy knoll, take some matchsticks and press them into the plasticine to represent the white picket fence. Say a novena. Now, grab another trunk of plasticine, and fashion a miniature version of the Texas School Book Depository. Remember to tweak a tiny tubular shape poking out of the sixth floor window to show assassin Lee Harvey Oswald mailorder mannlicher carcano rifle with which he shot the president. Some people would insert the word allegedly into that sentence, but not me. I have read CASE CLOSED by Gerald Posner so I know when I speak. A pink blob of plasticine will do for Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hat. The underpass over the stemmons freeway is quite tricky to make out of plasticine. So you may wish to use a few bits of cardboard. Your local supermarket probably has packaging and boxes piled up somewhere for customers to take away. Go and get sufficient boxes to cut enough cardboard for the underpass. And while you're out and about drop into your nearest Catholic Church and make your confession to father flirty. If your priest has a different name, don't worry. If you don't have a priest to worry for you will burn in hell. However skillfully you manage to complete your plasticine and cardboard model of Dealey Plaza. When you return home, your soul now washed clean of all disgusting filth. Put the finishing touches to your model by curving a rectangle of plasticine into the shape of the pergola from where these pruder footage was shot. If you have exhausted your tin of swore fieger, plunge your hands into a basin of piping hot soapy water while contemplating the martyrdom of your favorite saint.

Frank Key  04:53
Play to toy Dealey Plaza in a suitable location for example on the mantle piece display cabinet or kitchen table. Next time Father ofl. RT drops in for a cup of tea. Ask him to bless your model by sprinkling it with holy water. He will be happy to oblige. I am sure.

Frank Key  05:32
Continuing with our vaguely American theme, I suppose you could call that yes. I mean, it was an American American Plaza, continuing with our vaguely American theme, and I was asked by the travel cast, which is a United States pod weekly podcast, which occasionally in the past is featured some of my stories next month, or this month, or anyway, sometime in the very near future is going to be a sort of hooting yard sponsored series of travel costs. So you will have to look out for those I'll post details links on the hooting yard website. Anyway, among the things that I attempted to do was to do a slight rewrite of the American national anthem, the Star Spangled Banner, and to sing it for us now and accompanied, unfortunately, but to sing it for us. And it's my son, Edward. And he's gonna sing it for us. So take it away.

Unknown Speaker  06:45
Oh, say can you see only indistinct pillars, as you squelch through the marsh on your way to the pigsty in the cold and misty dawn, you are poked at with twigs by the sprites of the marsh who are strident and captious. You're not wearing your specs, you're disorientated, you sink to your knees in the vapors of Marsh gas, the sprites Harry you, and they Hector you to us spill all the pig feed out of yours in pale, such adorning as this on a wet Wednesday morning. It does make you wonder why you were born.

Frank Key  08:08
Round of applause they're brilliantly Sung. And apparently when it's on the drabblecast, it will have musical backing. So that's something to look forward to. And Ed will be back with us later in the show, playing the part of the bird. Now they are the first in a series of scenes from the lives of the great composers. And this is entirely true by the way. It's a Thursday afternoon in Rome. In a house on the Via del babuino. Princess Caroline Vaughn the same vidkun Stein is sitting at her escrow. tois scribbling furiously, a tonsured Abbe enters the room. But not just any tonsured Abbe, it is Princess Caroline for lover, the famous composer Franz Liszt, darling she cries Yes, sweetie it is I shout to this impassioned as you can see, I have crumbled in the face of your energetic persuasions. This very day. Cardinal whoa henlow has shaved my scalp and admitted me into Holy Orders. That is wonderful news cries the princess her bosom heaving. Indeed it is replies the list we must go out and celebrate. Suddenly, the princesses countenance takes on a look of deep religious solemnity, and she pouts. I'm afraid that will not be possible, darling. She murmurs for I have decided to retreat into a state of seclusion, such that if I live for another 27 years, I shall leave this house only once for people Have 24 hours really asks list nonplussed really replies the princess. And what on earth are you going to do with yourself sweetie cooped up in here for the best part of three decades until you're felled by a case of the dropsy? The princess gestures towards the pages and pages of scribblings on her Eskridge wall. Oh, you know how gregorius says I fairly sputter spirituality. I will devote my time to my book, interior causes of the exterior weakness of the church, which by the time I finish it, probably just a few days before I die will run I expect to 24 ponderous volumes. Well, you know, best sweetie says list. In that case, I may pop back to Weimar for a bit. I'm a bit worried that my granddaughter may one day become engaged to a man with the ominous sounding name foad. Cheerio then darling, says the princess. And don't forget to write me an enormous number of letters. I shall, sweetie and they shall often be hysterical in tone. I laugh to attempt a quotation from those letters would be like proffering a spoonful of brine and saying here is an idea of the ocean.

Frank Key  11:54
I my source for that. The gritty realism of that picture of 19th century Roman life in via Dell, but that was with a book by Rupert Hughes called the love affairs of great musicians. Volume Two, published in 1903. And well worth reading. You can find it online but very, very good book. Anyway, I'm now a play, which because I've got Ed with me I'm able to we've got the two voices we can do is play for two voices. I shall be playing Senor Placido a man of parts and ad will be Ambrose, a bird. And it's actually a plane verse. And it's called Ambrose and palapa.

Unknown Speaker  13:00
Bring me a jar of lemon curd. Can

Frank Key  13:03
such things be a talking bird? Why for the sow one lemon curd.

Unknown Speaker  13:11
perchance this day my loins too, too good.

Frank Key  13:15
I did not know that birds have loins. However, if you give me some coins, I will go and buy a jar. There is a Kurd shop not so far.

Unknown Speaker  13:25
I beg these in your use your own cash. Should I praise his fine mustache? your mustache is really great. Now hurry before it is too late.

Frank Key  13:36
Free or not the code shop never shopped, but,

Unknown Speaker  13:40
but me No buts. Go and buy my lemon curd or I shall be a distraught bird.

Frank Key  13:46
I loathe the prospect of a bird distraught. It goes against everything I was taught. My parents put it very well be good to birds, or your go to hell.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
If I had hands, I'd clap with glee this sin. The senior fears upsetting me. His childhood guilted haunts him yet. Make sure the lemon curds thick set I cannot bear it thin and runny. Are you quite sure you have no money? As sure as eggs is eggs in your now do not tarry any more. Go to the shop and buy me curd or I shall be a loin limp bird.

Frank Key  14:23
I will do as you ask and pay for your snack. Exit plot bow.

Unknown Speaker  14:30
The next scene is called when birds attack.

Frank Key  14:54
The currently there are plans to do a full proper performance Have Ambrose and plop out a very large theater? Possibly the national with? I don't know. So Ian McKellen is plopper I don't know what I'm talking about Anyway, I'm gonna read something instead. This is a recipe for bubble and squeak but not just a recipe for bubble and squeak but a recipe for bubble and squeak written by Christopher smart. Yes, Christopher smart, who wrote of course, Cuba latte agno. The extremely long time of which there is a three hour recording of it being read by me and germander speedwell Anyway, here is Christopher smart recipe for bubble and squeak. Take off beef, mutton, or lamb or veal or any other meat two pounds and then half or any other quantity, let it lay in salt till we Cylon particles have locked up all the juices of the animal and rendered the fibers too hard to be digested. then boil it over a turf or peat fire in a brass kettle covered with a copper lid till it is much done. Then take cabbage that which is most windy and capable of producing the greatest report and boil it in a bell metal pot till it is done enough or if you think it proper till it is done too much. Then slice the beef and Sue's that and the cabbage both in a frying pan together and let it bubble and squeak over a charcoal fire for half an hour, three minutes and two seconds. Then he's a quantum sophisticate, or two pounds and a half. And after it drinks 16 pints of fat, I'll smoke sleep snore Belk and forget your book.

Frank Key  17:12
I got that recipe via a very good blog called mustard plaster, there's a link to it on the hooting yard website. Anyways, worth a look anyway. I mentioned earlier or I may I can't remember whether Sorry, I can't remember whether I mentioned or not the new hooting yard paperback is now out. It's called impugned by a peasant and other stories. It's available via the hooting out website. If you go to hooting yard.org. On the on the right hand side of the screen, you'll see a little picture of the cover. And we got to do is click on that and click something else. And within about four and a half hours, you'll find yourself able to go and buy a copy of the book. So I would recommend that you do that for Christmas presents and all that sort of stuff. Oh dear any anyway. Yes. So do do that. While you're at the website, you may you can buy other books, you can make a donation, you can subscribe, all of these things are most welcome. And if everyone who listened to the podcast of this show, sent me a pound or $1 I could retire to pointy town. As a sort of advert for the paperback here is a piece that appears in it. It's called hoof print advice. upon waking the sight of hoof prints on the ceiling who've prints that were not there when you fell asleep can be worrisome. The regime has now issued a helpful step by step guide setting out precisely what to do in the circumstances. One, remain lying in bed quite still staring at the ceiling. Try to recall any dreams you may have had while you were asleep. Did any hooved beasts such as goats or horses feature in these dreams? If so, they were probably not dreams at all. And that's you have a preliminary explanation for the hoof prints on your ceiling. report this immediately to your local nocturnal hoof print investigating officer to if you did not dream of hooved beasts or cannot recall doing so you're left without a satisfactory explanation for the hoofprints This will not do get out of bed please Your head into a pile of icy water thrice and look again at the ceiling. If the hoof prints are no longer visible, bury the memory of ever having seen them. Three. If on the other hand, the hoof prints are still there, clamber onto a stepladder, and try to obliterate them with a rag and a proprietary cleansing spray, such as hoof begone. If you are able to eradicate the hoof prints entirely, fold up your stepladder, return the spray to your cupboard and wash the rag in warm soapy water. For it may be that the hoof prints on your ceiling are impossible to remove. Do not even think about painting over them with whitewash. Instead, get dressed in something fettering and pay a visit to the local nocturnal hoof print investigation office. Make an appointment to say a ceiling hoofprints specialist five at the subsequent interview. before you're tied to a chair in the cellar, provide the specialist with any snapshots you've taken of your ceiling. When asked to describe the hoofprints and any other phenomena that may be pertinent. Give full and Frank answers before the hood is pulled over your head. Six. When you recover consciousness in a ditch in a remote part of the country dressed in a paper suit, make your way to the border. report to the gods on another account say a word about the hoofprints. Submit willingly when one of the gods points a sort of magnetic raid gamma your brain.

Frank Key  22:01
Seven as a sleeper agent in the neighboring statelet, obtain a menial job and await further instructions. Note that the suckers on your hands and newly behooved feet should be kept free of dust and grime. Avoid podiatrists even in social settings such as cocktail parties and petanque tournament's.

Frank Key  23:03
That's almost the end of this week's show. But I thought on a whim, I thought it would be a really good idea if Ed and I together did a duet on Oh say can you see Oh say can you see only in this think blurs as you scrolled through the marshal on your way to the pigsty in the code misty dawn. You are poked at with twigs by the sprites of Marsh who are strident and captious. You're not wearing your specs, you're disorientated, you sink to your knees in the vapors of gas. The sides Harry you and they Hector you to use spare low pig feed out of your kin pile. Such adorning as this on a wet Wednesday morning. It does make you wonder why you were born. Gosh, that's the end of the show for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. And if not, boy, I certainly did. God, right carve down Mr. Key. That's the end of this week's shooting out on the air to come back next week when there'll be more similar material. Bye bye.
