Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. Coming to you live from the Science Museum. And this is hooting out on the air with me, Frank key. I'm going to begin this week by reading another story from the distant past from the previous century. A couple of stories actually. This was written so long ago, Margaret Thatcher was in power. And I didn't have any gray hair. This is called some Pons, a hotel. The Holly Hawks. won some pawns. There are seven poems. Their names are brink, cramped, dribble, Lamont presumption, ravenous, and I'm wholly in a lead box at the bottom of one of the ponds, an Icelandic fun tune wise sealed against the elements. But which palmed the fun tune is made of titanium, and it has a long history. A number of learned tomes has been devoted to pondering, pondering its existence, vocation, significance, color, smell, in controvert ability and malevolence. Its value is incalculable. A facsimile made of petrified dough was sold by the Museum at Hoon, for an undisclosed sum. The identity of the buyer was also undisclosed at the time. Now this shadowy figure has the true form tune almost in his classes. He is booked in to a hotel just 400 yards away from the pond to a hotel. The major Damo the hotel stared out of the dining room window, the sky was overcast. Soon the drizzle would begin. It always did. He hooted once and once only. He was afraid of shape, baffled by corkage continually muttering about the gasworks defiant in the face of adversity, elegantly ragged Folsom in his loading of snow, grotesquely carnivorous, helpless when confronted by Stark ignobly sodden just dying to shake hands with a lion tamer, kept waiting for hours by guests late for breakfast. List of ears yet death mistakenly shot at by poachers, nerve racked overcoated palpably grieving, quite likely to Hoot for a second time, reasonably be masked, still awaiting a voyage around the world tempestuous every Thursday, unbelievably festooned with old sacking and netting vigilant week. Zero fellas, despite the rain, young enough to know better, and zest for the prospect of nightfall nobody knew his name. He hooted for a second time, much louder. The hotel was fully occupied. Among the guests were anthropomorphic beings, bauxite, miners, cartographers, dribbling thugs, elk fancies from tune Hamza's, genuflecting, dolt, heroic chefs, idiot savons juggalos kailyn quarry workers, lopsided people, Marionette nortek nautical commodians old besmirched grave diggers, pond draggers, quicklime spreaders, ruthenians sink backers talong, maniacs, untidy throwbacks, vinegar brewers wax and image igniters xylophone construction experts Yellow Belly burglars and zinc inspectors watching them gobbling down their breakfast porridge, the major Damo tried to guess who was who an altercation was brewing the center table. An aged couple white haired and with frenzied gleans in their eyes We're raising their voices as a sallow wreck dressed entirely in foul smelling rags.

This man was Professor last talc, implacable seeker after the Icelandic farm tune. His antagonists were a cartographer and an idiot Sappho. Their names were respectively, Eileen and Wolfgang hollyhock. Three, the hollyhocks Professor Tao did not realize that for over 40 years the holly hawks had also been on the trail of the Icelandic farm tune. their interest had been ignited by Ireland's discovery of a tiny zinc from tune in the Serengeti in the 1940s. It appeared to have talismanic properties. Wolfgang had Catholic catalog these properties, dividing them into seven main groupings, elemental disheveled, yellow, crimped, congruent, dismal and vagabond. amongst their luggage the hollyhocks carried the fruits of years of research 100 Ledger's and a voluminous card index system contained information on all manner of fun tunes voiles westney old slabs, forensic triumphs and strobes. A parallel compendium of enticing facts about flags pennants and bunting had fallen over the edge of their raft some years ago, all been lost in a gigantic swamp. After the altercation at the breakfast table, the hollyhocks realized that Professor talc was like them on the verge of discovering the sunken lead box containing the Icelandic form tune. They were filled with consternation and immediately set out in the drizzle to drag the ponds that were by war horrifying. macintoshes. When they reached brink, the nearest of the pond town was already there, equipped with a thrilling collection of net poles, metal detectors, rotating Sarbanes crimping irons and bait. The major domos stood at the dining room window, piercing out through the drizzle towards the seven pounds. A fight had broken out among three of the guests mcintoshes had been removed and boxing gloves dawned. At first, only noses were bloodied. Then an array of weaponry came into use. There were gunshots there was wailing. Before long, all three guests had managed to drown each other and all in the same pond. But which pond and was it the same pond which contained the lead box and the Icelandic fun tune? The major Damo turned away. hooting quietly he trudged into the kitchen and made a start on the porridge and crusted bowls. He had work to do.

This is a another story from the same period a completely different story. This one's called some hotels or hollyhock. The poems won some hotels. There are seven hotels. Their names are Crone, crustacean flask in foot, sorry. I'm going to start again, there are seven hotels. Their names are Chrome, crustacean, flask, infection, miasma, unbearable, and vagabond. Each is built of cheap and rusty metal and is perched on the edge of a precipice. There are seven precipices either, each of which a scientist of note has plunged to a watery death during the last two weeks. in chronological order, those who plummeted were a botanist, a physicist, a phrenologist and our ologists a laboratory get a bacteriologist, and an uproariously mustachioed vivisection Ernest. He had been a paying guest at one of the hotels, though none of them have hustled over the precipice upon which their own hotel teetered the phrenologist for example, breakfast did upon porridge in the hotel miasma, then threw herself from the pocket and crumbling cliff face adjacent to the Crone hotel. or was she pushed? It is in hope of answering this question that the indefatigable Hungarian detective Buland held bag has trudged on to the same. He is seven feet tall sports a raffish wind treater, and has booked into all seven hotels within the space of half an hour, using a variety of aliases and disguises. The infection hotel He is known to the staff was Broderick magoon, a Scottish safety engineer of sober mean and modest wealth is only luggage, a small tote bag, the hotel vagabond he has them convinced that he is barren glob avant glubb a ferocious watersports enthusiast lewd and boisterous, who displays a vast array of bobsled championship medals upon his turquoise tunic. For these and for his five other identities, Detective hell bag has all the necessary documentation, forged passports and letters of transit doctored photographs and other seemingly personal memorabilia at 4pm, firmly established in all seven hotels, he is to be found pasting a piece of blotting paper head height to the outside wall of the crustacean hotel laundry room. Such attention to detail is the mark of the great detective, and hell bag is in no doubt as to the sheer magnitude of his own genius. As ever, he has imposed upon himself a strict timetable for solving the case. He is confident that he can wrap it up within 48 hours. Indeed, such is his arrogance that he has overlooked one startling fact the major Domo, the unbearable, bearable hotel is held bags brother Rolfe, whom he has not seen from 10 years. The last time they met in vegetation and in or they made a handshake last for hours. Then, two days later, Roth was sentenced to hang for the brutal slaying of a Greenland ship's captain who scowl he smashed to pieces with a windy go

to a hollyhock. The most luxurious of the hotels is the one beginning with B. It's tremendous garden, festooned with foliage, where was until recently tended by a retired sea captain, whose glaucoma and rickets gave him increasing drip. Following a series of incidents involving his shark or his cardigan, he was I'm sorry, none of the hotels has a name beginning with B. I'll have to start that chapter again. To a hollyhock. The least repugnant of the hotels is the one beginning with F. Its gardens another tremendous folio dribbled North tended by a half blind shark owning old salt. Indeed, it can hardly be said to have a garden at all. The floor of the lobby is covered in sand, soil or mud, and ridiculous chaffinches Witter from the rooftops but the only foliage to be seen in the flask Kotel. There's a huge cement hollyhock in the dining room, place there at the behest of a permanent resident saved by name, who's often tremendous, who's often truculent gob, Ill Buffett, a man of the cloth, cleverly concealed a top the very pinnacle of the cement hollyhock is a sliver of bitumen imbued with monstrous properties. It is at once refulgent and Cal serious, dismaying and arcane. In years past, those who sought to possess it had had their heads boiled. Three weeks ago, the surly Sage implanted the hollyhock in the house. Tell which had become his home and proceeded to paint it with thick coats of gaudy colors. He had stolen this paint from a wooden heart next to one of the nearby palms, not realizing that in doing so, he was burgling the nerve center of Rolf held bags, frantic and unholy schemes. Within days of sedges theft, a stench of vinegar hung in the air about his head, and his tongue grew furry. Free the palms.

We've been marking these shows from the Science Museum with opposite readings from further science book 20 by Norman Davis. pamphlet published in 2001. So here is some more of Norman Davis his insights into science. And I should point out but I'm reading them absolutely. As they're, as they're printed or published in this little book. It has a yellow cover in case you're interested a plain yellow cover. This is Norman Davis's further science book 20 on Alaskan birds. Wow. That analysis of Alaskan birds gives insight into bird evolution.

That was almost like the resonance you know and love, wasn't it. So I'm babbling on about the United States and capitalism and that sort of thing. Not the usual hooting out material. But as I say that was Norman Davis from further science, which is one of the great books of our time. And there'll be more of that next week. I think when we're doing our last show from the Science Museum. speaking through Big Horn, and finally on this week show what to do on a winter's day in tanta arobin. I know it's not winter and you're not in tanta or been but nevermind. Just remember this for a few months time. This handy guide has been produced by the Tampa Bay Tourist Board, a body riddled with corruption from top to toe. Although its internal politics need not concern the innocent listener, and merely wishes to spend a few joyous hours in the bailiwick of tan Tara beam on a cold and blustery winter's day, swaddled in woolen garments against the elements. Let's start again. This is a handy guide to the sort of activities you and your family can enjoy in tan tower BIM during the winter months. Should you be unlucky enough to have your plane maker fourth landing there due to storminess? Surely the only reason to go anywhere near tan tower beam in the first place, given how frightening it is. Having said that, for the tourist who does not mind discomfort and privations. tantau erbin can be a source of much entertainment and interest if the words are used loosely. So put on your hat and come with me now. As we creep past the gore splattered beasts with venomous fangs which guard all approaches to the town and I shall list at least five things you can do when stuck in tan tower beam during a blizzard. One plummet helplessly down one of the many hidden shoots which deliver you into a flaming pit to be poked at with pointed sticks by cloven hooved intps, spitting sulfur, you will have lots of fun trying to shake them off, but we guarantee you won't succeed. Three take a guided tour of the Kroc ice factory. The price of entry includes the opportunity to taste their wares for become embroiled in a fight to the death with bonecrusher Jim and untimed Python which has been deprived of food for months. Five spend a night in one of 10 Tara beams many ins where you will be entranced by the primitive Gaslight, inexplicable nighttime banging and crashing noises, swarms of Phantom locusts, and walls and ceilings that seemed to move when you're not looking. Most things do not charge for children under 16 probably because they're likely to be abducted by strange amphibious monsters and dragged into the vast and pitiless sea.

That's almost the end of this week's show. But there's time for one last brief life for my forthcoming book of brief, brief lives. And this is the life of Sylvester Patridge, an English astrologer of the I think of the 18th century. patridge took space in poor Robin's Almanac in 1733 to advertise his services, which were as follows the best time to cut hair, how moles and dreams are to be interpreted when most people will season to bleed under what aspect of the moon best to draw teeth and cut corns. pairing of males on what they unlucky what the kindness sign to graft or inoculate is to open beehives and kill swine.
