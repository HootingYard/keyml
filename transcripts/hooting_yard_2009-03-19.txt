Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM as you've just heard, my name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And this is a story called boiled black broth and cornets. I paid a visit to my friend Becca by the bigs in her fortress in the mountains. We had known each other since childhood, growing up on a post war housing estate, a workaday world of compactness and convention. But Becca was always a single minded girl who followed her own strange star. And while the rest of us went off to polytechnics and office jobs and became fodder for a peculiarly dull witted type of English fiction, Becca decamped to the mountains and built herself a fortress with her bare hands. I had no idea where she picked up the skills to do this. And in truth, when I visited I was astonished to find how solid and immense and impregnable her fortress appeared, a massive edifice perched upon a bluff, as forbidding in its aspect as the Schloss Adler in where Eagles dare, but without the Nazi connotations for Becker was the most apolitical person I have ever known. When she greeted me at the gate, she was holding a corn it in her hand. Hello, Dennis, she said, planting a peck on my cheek. As you can see, I have taken up the corn it like my near namesake big spider Becker, the original young man with a horn and perhaps the greatest jazz man of the 1920s. From fortress building to Cornett playing you never cease to amaze me, Becker replied, dumping my weekend luggage in a corner of the green brick vestibule. As you're well aware, Dennis, I follow my own strange star, she said, staring me into the canteen of the fortress, where she ladled soup out of a tureen into a pair of bowls. This is my homemade soup she announced, for in addition to building the fortress and learning to play the kornet I have taken a correspondence course in devising original soup recipes. In your bowl, you have what I have dubbed Becca by the bricks is boiled black broth, in which every single ingredient begins with the letter B. As you can see, it's a black soup of a black, so black, that if you stare at it, instead of spooning it into your mouth, you will become entranced pretty much like a voodoo zombie person and be entirely within my power. Then I shall shut my eyes while I drain the bowl Becker. I said, Yes, I was about to recommend you do just that, Dennis, she replied. The soup proved to be bland and without even a hint of taste, but it warmed my innards and stop the gurgling in my belly. Now that your belly has stopped gurgling Dennis, I shall take you to see my workshop said Becca, and I followed her into the bowels of the fortress to a room with 1000 padlocks and reinforced walls and sputtering candles. I half expected to see a gibbering hunchback named mango. But it seems Becca worked without assistance. Well now, I said you have many towering piles of metal Tapping Machine directories from all around the world, much thumb through and dog eared as if you've been poring over them with terrific diligence Becker that I have Dennis, she replied, It is drudgery To be sure, but necessary to the success of my project. Of course, I asked her what the project was, and her reply shocked me to the marrow. For all that has started was a strange one. It had never occurred to me that Becca was capable of the abduction and incarceration in dungeons beneath her fortress of eight completely innocent souls. She had gone through those directories searching for names, and when she lit upon an app name, she tracked the person down wheresoever they might be and she crept up on them and shoved a rag soaked in chloroform over their breathing channels and shoved them into the back of her van and drove like the devil himself at Tip Top speed until back in her mountain fastness. And then she dragged the abductee down into one of her dungeons and slammed the heavy iron door shut up on them and made

an Every day thereafter, she took them a bowl of her black black soup and made them stare into its blackness until it was lukewarm. So they were pretty much like Voodoo zombie persons entirely within her power. And then she commanded them to drink the soup until the gurgling in their bellies ceased. But why Becca? Why? I shrieked as if taking part in a melodrama, wondering how the sensible, resourceful woman I had known had become quite loopy. Oh, this is only part one of the plan, Denis, she said, it will all make perfect sense now that I have an abductee in each of my eight dungeons. You will not believe how long it's taken me to work my way through those confounded directories to find the names I need. And then, of course, to travel hither and yon to wherever they are, and do the bit with the chloroform which has its own risks. You gape at me Gaga lied, Dennis, as if I've taken leave my senses, and I would agree with you, but not that all this is merely a preparation for a grander scheme. I did not discover over that weekend what the grander scheme was, Becca showed me a few other things in her workshop, including some mysterious small trunks, then insisted that we head on up to her rooftop ping pong area and play ping pong for hours and hours. Every so often, she took a break to visit the dungeon, and left me to lie on my back exhausted staring at the bitter sky, trying not to think about what in heaven's name was going on far below in the subterranean depths of the fortress. I made my farewell on the Sunday evening, after being given a bowl of a different homemade soup which I could suck without shutting my eyes. It was as bland as the black zombie soup, but extremely welcome after all that ping pong. Becca waved at me as I trudged down the mountainside towards the bus stop. I looked back and there she stood, her fortress gate, and above her in the now darkening sky on a single star. I couldn't help but smile. She may have become bonkers, but she would always be my power. a year or so past. I was too busy with my halibut research to give much thought to Becca and her eight abductees, I sent her the occasional metal Tapping Machine message to which we always replied, although she never said much about what she was up to confining herself to remarks about general fortress maintenance. And then one day, passing through pointy town, some kind of woolly hat student in need of pin money handed me a leaflet. I shoved it into my pocket and forgot about it. And only later as I was rummaging through my jacket for scrunched up halibut research notes, did I come upon it and read it? pointy town hepcat jazz club it said is pleased to announce a concert by a thrilling new combo.

That story was I sold that story to a podcast called the drabble cast, which apparently has nothing to do with Margaret drabble. And it was given a reading the other week by the guy who runs the podcast called normal German, normal is American. And so it's a completely different delivery. It was quite interesting to listen to it because he's very, very dramatic when he reads and someone commented on that, that he sounds very dramatic, whereas others Why sound in different? So I'm quite interesting that people think certain listeners to gravel casts think I sound in different, maybe I do. And this is called boiling my lady Kent pudding. I was looking through a 19th century book called Thor muttered Jia or elucidations of the marvelous the other day, and I came across a quotation which I very much enjoy. I'll read it to you. We shall conclude our astrological strictures with the following advertisement, which offered which affords us find a satirical specimen of quackery as is to be met with. It is extracted from poor Robin's Almanac for 1773 and may not be without it use too many at the present day. We will vouch for it being harmless, but as we're not in the secret of all that it contains our readers must endeavor to get the information that may be wanted on certain important points from other quarters. advertisement the best time to cut hair, how moles and dreams are to be interpreted when most proper season to bleed under what aspect of the moon best to draw teeth and cut corns. pairing of nails on what day unlucky? What are the kindest sign to graft or inoculate in to open beehives and kill swine? How many hours boiling my lady Kent pudding requires, with other notable questions fully and faithfully resolved by me Sylvester Patridge, student in physic and astrology near the gun in more fields, of whom likewise may be had at reasonable rates, trusses antidote elecsys love powders washes for freckles plumpers glass eyes false calves and noses ivory drawers and a new receipt to turn red hair into black. Now, one man who knew a thing or two about boiling my lady can pudding apart from Sylvester Patrick was Blodgett. Blodgett first came upon the recipe when he was under the color nary tutelage of the so called culinary King of cuxhaven benzi poplars. poplars himself on earth the pudding details during his researches in an archive of pudding recipes at the Texas Recipe Book Depository in Dallas, bang next door to the more famous or infamous Texas School Book Depository from a sixth floor window, which on a November day in 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald shot president john Fitzgerald Kennedy with a mailorder mannlicher carcano rifle. Some would add allegedly after that statement, but not me. I've read my Posner nobody so far as we know ever shot anyone from a window of the recipe book depository next door, not even benzi poplars, who, when he was not rummaging through old recipe books, could himself be impelled to act of senseless violence. He wants broke Blodgett legs for example, quite deliberately with blows from a tent peg mallet. poplars called this Merritt his hammer of pedagogy, which was something of a misnomer, as he also used it to crack eggs to bash out dents in his pans and to hammer tent pegs into campsite mud. He was fond of taking students on camping trips to the outskirts of cuxhaven and having them forage or starve.

It was on one such escapade when Blodgett was still on crutches, that teacher and student fell into a lengthy conversation about puddings. The culinary King had only recently returned from his Texas trip, and His head was full of the recipes he had discovered in the pudding archive. The countryside around cuxhaven was at the mercy of roaring winds that weekend, and poplars and his students were huddled in their tents. It was not foraging, whether the pedagogue made a point of sharing his tent with any student whose bones he had broken in a fit of tempo. And so it was Blodgett on this occasion, who sprawl got his master's feet. As far as puddings went, Blodgett knew almost as much as benzi poplars. He had immersed himself in the world of puddings since infancy, and it was this enthusiasm that it led him to sign up to the culinary kings crash course in the first place. For though Blodgett could tell you about thousands of different puddings, he had no idea how to make a single one of them In the tents as Gail's house and canvas flapped populism Blodgett talked about puddings for hours, of course, said benzi poppers pompously. Sylvester patridge claimed to know the correct boiling time for my lady Kent pudding. But the man was a charlatan and a fool. And if you boil it for the time he recommended, you will end up with a pretty sorry excuse for a pudding. Tell me more said Blodgett all ears because he was a pudding that remarkably he had never heard of. And as his tutor prattled on, Blodgett, scraped shorthand notes onto one of his crutches with a sharpened twig. Years later, far from cuxhaven, restored in limb, and now a dab hand cooking the puddings he had once merely salivated over, Blodgett stumbled upon his old crotch and decipher the scrapings he had made upon it. He turned he transcribed them into a notebook, embellished them and published them as part of which fittingly was acquired by the trustees of the pudding archive, the Texas Recipe Book Depository on way is the pudding named after my lady Kent. Should it be steamed before boiling or afterwards? Should it indeed be steamed at all? Or should one just get on and boil it? What's the best type of pan in which to chuck for putting ingredients prior to boiling? Does the pan matter? If the pan is dented? Should one bashed out the dense with the hammer of pedagogy beforehand? If one neglects to do so. Will any indentations in the finished pudding caused by the dense add to it savor? Or will I detract from it? Is there a place in the contemporary world for dented puddings? Or should we be aiming for clean lines and smooth entries? Can a modern version of my lady Kent pudding compete with the original? Should we allow indentations irrespective of their effect simply because in all likelihood, give him the rough and tumble of the times my lady can't own pans would have been outrageously dented. Rare was the pan in those days that did not get bashed about and suffer because of that bashing. That may be one reason for the popularity of puddings for their a cogent argument claiming that the final shape of a pudding, particularly a boiled pudding matters not a jot to the eater of the pudding. Are there any cases we can advert to where a pudding has been sent back from table with the complaint? I cannot eat this pudding. It is dented. Such reservations are likely with other things one might eat a duck of the wrong shape. Likewise, a pig's head or a pie full of misshapen blackbirds will cause revulsion for the eater may think rightly that they are being fobbed off with abominations of nature. But there is no such thing as the correct shape of a pudding, not even of my lady Kent pudding. And yet to make one that is succulent and lipsmacking remains a challenge and takes years of study, sometimes in a tent on the outskirts of cuxhaven while Canvas is buffeted and fierce winds blow. Well, it doesn't escape the readers notice that Blodgett fails to answer many of the questions he or benzi poplars before him raises and nor does he provide a workable recipe for the pudding he's so enthused about. That's Blodgett a rover Of course, infuriating and exasperating, yet strangely adorable for all that.

Incidentally, it said that The Dressmaker, Abraham Zapruder, who filmed the famous footage of the Kennedy assassination on his top of the range model four one for PD eight millimeter Belen house Zoo Matic director series movie camera was planning to spend the afternoon following the passing of the presidential motorcade in the Texas Recipe Book Depository, specifically to consult Blodgett book. Whether he was intending to boil my lady Kent pudding and was looking for helpful hints. We do not know. And now we never will, for history took a fateful turn on that sunny day in Dallas, and the dressmakers boiled pudding thoughts were wiped clean from his brain, but not from yours or mine.

A number of listeners have asked me asked me to tell them about my pellets. So here goes. Some of the pellets were regurgitated by cats, some were gobbled up by owls, and some are made of metal to be fired from a shotgun. All of my pellets fall into one of these three categories. I think, if I think some more, which I'm not going to do, it might occur to me that some of my Pellets have a provenance other than those three. But I can always issue a corrective at a later date. After I've thought some more even if I recall some other type of pellet, it remains the case that the vast majority of my pellet arrived or those vomited up by cats, or by owls, or those made of metal meant to be shot at something such as a crow or a scarecrow, or an irritating person. Yes, I have been known to fire metal pellets from a shotgun that person to irritate me. I'm sure that's lamentable, even criminal behavior. But we all have our breaking points. And if you start to moralize with me and suggest that I flipped my lid a little too readily. I might well agree with you. That you and I have now not sat on the same buses, no. traipse the same retail facility aisles, so you'd be better off holding your tongue. of more interest than my metal pellets and my cat and owl pellets, which are of course organic, and often contain the barely recognizable remains of small mammals, such as mice and field mice, or of the tinier birds. Some of these Pellets have been dropped in my doorway as gift, and some I have collected on crawling expeditions in the forest. It's an extensive forest and home to many owls, like perch on the branches of trees and Hoot As night falls. And in the darkness, they swoop upon mice and field mice. And in the morning, they gobble up pellet and there is me with my sack wandering the forest but dawn on the lookout. I wear a charm bracelet when I wander in the forest to keep me safe from kelpies. It's unfortunate that my cam bracelet doesn't protect me from irritating persons. I did try to modify it by adding hooks up pellets from a bird of prey from a hawk, in fact, but still I was beset on buses and in retail facilities. But the rude and the gormless that's it was that I added to my collection of metal pellets for the firing of them from a shotgun as necessity demanded. Watching a cat Hawk up a pellet from its innards is an educative experience. There often appears to be much undigested grass from lawns impacted in the pellet. And yet I can never recall seeing a cat feeding upon grass much as if it were a cow, which we're used to seeing eat grass. At least I'm used to such a site for I often watch cows, it's my hobby. If I've been put somewhere where cows are scarce or non existent, I'll travel to find them so I can watch them have an afternoon or have a morning or even a bloody day if I'm in a cow watching mood. Cows become the soul. And yet as far as I know, they don't regurgitate pellets as Captain owls do. I do not watch owls. I simply trace their presence in the forest armed with my sack and collect the pellets like gobbled up. I do not think it would become me to watch out. while wearing night vision goggles in the depths of the forest. I would always be on my guard against kelpies. Even when wearing my charm bracelet, my heart would be hammering. irritating persons are of course the opposite of becoming an impervious to the magic of my charm bracelet. That's why they have to be dealt with by metal pellets from a shotgun. peppered with pellets they run away screeching. Before I wore my charm bracelet I used to run away screaming from kelpies. I would hoist my sack upon my back and go wandering into the forest at night to collect pellets hooked up by owls. And very often I'd be pursued or set upon or threatened or menaced by kelpies and with an empty sack rung screeching until I was safely back in whatever hat I'd been put by the authorities.

My cat and metal pellets outnumbered by owl pellets to a great degree. There was a terrible imbalance and it was my recognition of this that led me To make the charm bracelet, I followed instructions from a pamphlet written by a man whose life had been blighted by kelpies, but who had been able to deter them by wearing a bracelet of beads and baubles and pellets and bones and teeth and feathers and sugar cubes. It was for me, always an awful temptation to suck upon and crunch the sugar cubes on my charm bracelet. For I have a very sweet tooth. But I enrolled in a 12 step program run by sugar cube suckers and crunches anonymous, and that's sorted out my head. You have to sort out your head sooner or later, wherever the authorities have put you be at a heart or a shade, shade, hut or a shade or an outbuilding. I found that developing an interest in my palette collection was the thing that rescued me from a hopeless pilotless existence. Season. My palettes all aligned and cataloged in my cabinet, the cat and the Owl and the metal and not a kelpie within 100 yards of my heart. I'm a happy man.

Finally this week and very briefly, here's some stuff about elk in snow. Ah, there was snow, so much snow snow falling without pours until the world was white and cold, so very cold. We shivered in our hovels. And there were Elks in the snow massive and elegant and stamping their hooves. That's what else do in snow. They stamp their hooves. See them nostrils flared stamping their hooves in the snow, see them from your hovel where you're shivering. Your chromosomes are anomalous, and your head is misshapen, and you have no hat and you wish you have a hat. you've pulled over catalogs of hat, yet never had the cash to buy a hat, not even the cheapest of hat. The God knows some hat so cheap. It's a shame to put one on your misshapen head. Public shame for seeing the trip hat atop your misshapen head. There will be many interxion and a ragamuffin who will delve deep into their store of abusive words and spout them at you safe in the knowledge that you will not retaliate for they know you for a milk SOP, a milk toast, a man of misshapen head and a cheap hat, who would not dare to crack them around their ears. Even if after their cruel words. They picked up pebbles, pebbles from the snow and threw the pebbles at you hitting you on the arms and on the legs on on the torso and on the trip hat you wore on your misshapen head, your head, your head, Your Head Head Head Head Head that misshapen head you have on top of your neck or head you can't change can't swap swap for another another more shapely head ahead you might prefer a majestic Imperial head, one deserving of or from the proletariat ahead to be bowed down to ahead copied thousands if not millions of times in the yellow on medals, your head yes your head, but it will never be your head because your head is misshapen, and you do not even have a hat to put upon it. Not even the creepiest hat from a discount Hatters. No. All you have is your bare misshapen head resting upon an uncultivated neck, a head that will never be bad down to nor neoload in metals ahead, misshapen and wet bearing a Buffon that invite ridicule from stylish trendy, trendy to our cozy in their cabins somewhere else, somewhere far away, remote remote somewhere other than your hovel in the snow, where you skulk while Elks flare their nostrils and stamp their hooves as elk do elegantly in snow from time to time on Wednesdays on Wednesday, potato nights
