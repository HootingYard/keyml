Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. So, so here is that was a good start, wasn't it? Nice to get out the intro. And as soon as I started saying something else, a coughing fit. Let's try again. Hi, this is resonance fm.com or resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank Kay. And this is hooting yard on the air. Right? onwards. So actually, I really hate that habit people have a beginning sentences with so it really really annoys me. Yeah, so

Frank Key  01:11
john, what? What was the weather like outside?

Unknown Speaker  01:16
Say? It is so

Frank Key  01:19
annoying. It is so annoying. And I only realized when I start reading this that this piece I'm about to read you begin to read so which is very annoying. I'm very sorry. I apologize. Cannot get rid of the so I think I can I'm gonna get rid of it. Here is Dobson reclining in an arbor on a bright fresh morning. The grasses do dappled Dobson has an air of latitude. In his right hand. He holds a slim volume of twee verse, but he is not reading. He is gazing into the middle distance wrapped in thought. little birds are perched on a bow above him and they are singing sweet and mellifluous as I'm sorry, that's wholly inaccurate. Let's start again. It's pouring with rain. Dobson wind swept and dejected, is trudging along the muddy toe path of the canal. He has a scowl on his face. Suddenly he stops appears at something floating in the canal something fetid and rotting and quite an identifiable. so fascinating. Does Dobson find this soggy? Nothing that he does not notice the approach of popsy shadrack, the notorious floozy. You were absorbed in thought Dobson observes the wanton planting herself in front of him and twirling some taffeta frippery through her long fingers, the nails of which are painted Crimson or scarlet, or some other garish color suitable for a floozies manicure. I was indeed replies the pamphleteer after clearing his throat and spitting into the canal. There is a slim volume of twee verse by Dennis beer pond poking out of the pocket of his grubby jacket, and it does not go unremarked by popsie. You were thinking of her you love I would wager she says and size. It is a startlingly impassioned sigh, but Dobson appears not to take a blind bit of notice. Instead, he begins trying to dislodge a shred of cabbage from these teeth, first by probing with his tongue, and then by shoving a callus finger into his gold. Dobson's nails are unpainted, in fact, they are hideously Nord popsy shadrack size again, languidly this time. You are beloved in return. Yes, Dobson, most charming of out of print pamphleteers You are indeed Beloved, she says. There is a tremulous in her voice of throbbing in her breast, and a fleeting shudder as Dobson finally manages to extract the shred of cabbage and inadvertently flicked it into her face. She blinks but regains her composure sultriness and edges closer to the pamphleteer Are you certain he replies? Eventually, though, he is still appearing at the decaying matter which is bobbing in the water. Oh, I am back to certain you are beloved. Oh, how madly by me Cross popsie and she flings herself at his feet carrying not a jot that her gaudy red dress is now covered in muck by you popsy shadrack notorious floozy that you are, you dressed Surely, rise rise, I beseech you from your unbecoming posture unbecoming towards me, shouts Dobson, turning to look at popsy for the first time, as he does so, a maniac crow flies past very close to his head, attracted perhaps by The Beatles, which crawl through his unkempt hair. Oh dogs and I love you, I adore you. Spam me not then I Condrey you for I cannot cannot conquer the fatal passion with which you have inspired me implores the Tories floozy clutching at the hem of Dobson's filthy jacket and pulling on it so violently that the sort of volume of 20 verse by Dennis bear pond falls from his pocket into a puddle. Dobson stamps his big boot onto the rug ruined paperback squelching it on the foot.

Frank Key  06:21
This dress shadrach you strike me with horror. It is marigold to my muse, amanuensis and typesetter that I love, he smiles on the other side of the canal. The Greenbrier pig emerges from a clump of trees. It has roamed far from its sky and is quite lost. What and you will never love me pamphleteer babble popsie No, never while I have breath never yells Dobson slightly distracted by the appearance of the pig and wondering whether or not to report it citing to the nearest lost and abandoned pig reporting station. Allow me if possible to respect you. He adds, but he has no intention of doing so. popsy shadrach claws at his jacket rises to feet and takes a melodramatic step backwards, almost toppling into the canal. She flailed her arms alarmingly, and declares in a screech curses then sees the miscreant. I will live to blast the for this. The pig disappears back into the crease, but not before Dobson has taken out his notepad and pencil and jotted down a memorandum popsy shadrach awaits his response frozen in an attitude of boiling rage. most infamous of women says Dobson once he is satisfied that he will be able to make an accurate report of the last pig adding as he returns his pattern, pencil to his inside pocket. Let me fly from my loathed presence. Let me in the wide world seek a refuge from infamy and shame. For infamy It is to be the object of divine love. Batting popsie aside the pamphleteer trudges off along the towpath, there is a cloudburst overhead and the rain splatters down relentlessly. popsie scampers back to the carpark and rest and revs a souped up jalopy thundering offered reckless speed towards a gin joint. We do not know whether Dobson will actually seized by her curses, nor whether he she succeeded in blasting him. But it may be pertinent that when he went to the lost and abandoned pig reporting station later that day, to report his sighting of the lugubrious pig, he found it shot. With a few minor adjustments, all of the lines of dialogue in that piece was stolen from xof lawyer or the more by Charlotte Dacre published in 1806.

There is or there may have been an old superstition that every farm yard has its own themed It is said that the elephant I personally allotted eat fiend to its farmyard and ratcheted up the fiendish pneus of his dastardly plan by making the themes extremely hard to identify. So for example, neighboring farmyards might have very, very different resident themed. A pig here, an old rusty iron pale. They're a one legged ham in one farm yard, and a big bright red tractor belching smoke in another. exorcising a farm yard of its themed is thus fraught with difficulty. For the average countryside Exorcist, stepping through the gate of a farm yard, for the first time does not know where to begin to look. There is a great disparity in the fiendish pneus of farm yard fiends and some diabliss have argued that bales about treated the whole matter with an uncharacteristic lack of diabolic concentration. For every farmer that is stricken by an energetic field, there are many more that can pass for years, even decades in untroubled, bucolic peace. But of course, it's the former that gain attention, Who can forget the ruination visited upon screwin hunahpu farm yard in the 1950s all those crop failures, diseases, fires, murders, contaminations, and inexplicable bugs bomb collapses, which ceased only when a marauding nighttime squirrel was captured in a net by Father Dermot Boggess and subjected to the full rigor of his holy Roth. It took six months for the exorcist to expel every last vestige of fiendish pneus from the squirrel, leaving the poor bushy tail mammal thin and shriveled and exhausted and close to death. And yet, as it was slowly revived by the coddling of old mob purgative at Verdun verdant squirrel sanctuary, so too did the farm yard flourish are new, with majestic fields of golden wheat, gleaming new buckets, replacing the old rusty pails and happy happy pigs. You would be forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard fiends is precisely the kind of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed, marigold to often pressed him to tackle the topic, supplying the out of print pamphleteer with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations of an agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the once popular monthly magazine, glimpses of farmyard ruin, and wrote many letters to the editor, some of which were published and one of which October 1954 was selected as letter of the month, for which marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize was a very large hog with a brain disease, which went on wild rampages through the house. mischievously, the editor of the magazine who had his own farm yard regularly used the monthly prize to rid himself of his farm yard fiends. I you yes notes the plural. What happens you will ask when a thing of the farmyard is identified and destroyed, whether by slaughter exorcism or being given away as a prize in a raffle tombola or by some other means, as happened with marigold to did screwin hoon, pooch farmyard stay fiend free, wanted sinister squirrel had its demons cast out how attentive was Beelzebub, to the welfare of those he had sent to wreak havoc in our boschi rural domains, where new fiends recruited and trained to carry out various infernal farmyard acts of fiendish pneus. These and other questions were answered by Father Dermot Boggess himself. In his deathbed ravings, carefully transcribed by his wrinkled old helpmeet, the widow popsicle. among the thousands of pages to scribbled, we find this startling passage.

Frank Key  14:47
God, God, inexplicably torment of the devils among poking fork. There's legal Cataclysm of shuttering a basement in the pit and when you do last See your potatoes. God have the fields been hold. I see hundreds of cows, thousands of cows, millions of cows, brutes, the flames of the fiery furnace, a crew on the crow on the branch of a dead tree blasts of lightning. No diesel for the tractor, blight prolite worms eating the flesh of resurrected horses. Never record never resurrect a horse never, never resurrect a horse never passed me that feeble lamp, puddles of slight good slop and constant rainfall 40 days and 40 nights flooded fields that we ruined, got poisoning a gruesome figure in the shroud of death. Find me a lonely cave remote from humankind, dark as the midnight grave and dismal as my mind gap. And with that last brief flash of lucidity, the remembered words of john Eccles, circa 1688. To 1735 father bogguss relapsed into inanimate inanity 400 pages worth of the widow popsicles, palsy pencils scroll. The clues of the farmyard fiends damnable resilience is, I think, in that reference to the crow perched on the branch of a dead tree. Dawn is near the sun will soon be writing your path to the far flung field. Go until you go and tell and plough and Harrow. Feed your horses and your cows and your happy happy pig pigs. You may spit upon your farmyard fiend, it will pass to you no more. It was only ever a superstition, or it might have been

kinda divey fanatical adherents of trebizond Oh Cal pepper smashed their way by main force through the huge iron gates of Fort hoity. They were both astonished and disappointed to find the fort deserted, safe for a tethered goat in the courtyard. The gods have extended far enough for it to be able to reach your flower bed by one foot wall. So it was a well nourished goat as well as a tethered goat. That goat said the fanatical trebizond Oh Cal pepper adherents they called dim as eaten half the flowers in that flower bed, and has not even begun on the weeds. His companions jotted this observation down in their logbooks under B for BIM. They each use the spidery handwriting they had learned that their feet of crab is on local peppers penciling Master, the nameless gravel voiced Peruvian laundry basket man who had inadvertently sent them to Fort hoity in the first place. replacing their log books in that pocket. The adherence gathered about BIM who was now lolling by a brazier in which hot coal burns still, clearly, the fort had not long been abandoned. This fort has not long been abandoned, said BIM for the cold in this brazier burns still, but how did the fought people flee? If they had left barbecue Dr. Gates, we would have seen them when we were standing on the hill as dawn broke and we ate our breakfasts, the plans of the fourth which we have studied so conscientiously show no other exits. This then is a highly perplexing circumstance. I wonder if that goat In addition to being tethered and well fed is also a talking goat. The fanatical adherents known as BAM slapped his forehead. For crying out loud beam, he shouted, have you taken leave of your senses? There is no such thing under the heavens as a goat that speaks human language. That is the stuff of fairy tales. The other fanatical adherents mumbles together as a group, both bear man BAM had them confused now, for they had expected to rent a fort hoity through main force and to be chopping and slashing and unleashing Madcap havoc. Instead, they were standing around mumbling and pondering the connection if there was one between fairies, elves, sprites and goats. The fanatical adherents named Diocletian, much mustachioed, raised the topic of tethering, if one could tether a goat as the fort hoity goat had been tethered, could one tether a fairy? Would a fairy not be nimble enough to slip it bonds to this? Pembroke it suggested that a fairy could surely be tethered by using gossamer thin, magical thread. The mumbling grew louder time was passing, Ben made an announcement. Not many leagues yonder is fought toity. I know in my bones that is where the 40 people have gone. I know not how they got there, but that is where they must be. We shall leave a team here to secure the place and the rest of us will march like the clappers to Fort toity, and we shall untether the goat and take it with us. And so bear man his big dragon gang of fanatical crevice on dough cold pepper adherents set out to traipse across the plane whistling as they marched. Those who had not undergone whistling training popped Hooters instead, or imitated crows corncrakes and loons. Every so often, they would stop and sit and eat from their bags of confectionery and bear more bandwidth make pronouncements and the band of fanatical adherents would drop down there at their Sue's all sorts of subjects related to the teachings of trebizond bo Cole pepper were covered from his dishwater, and clanging noises to oil slicks, and the bossa nova from freckles and optometry to caddy and tack. They tied a colorful and perfume rag to one ear of the untethered goat

Frank Key  22:55
and let it lead the way across the plane towards fort toity. So Werber who, so who were they the people they pursued, who had fled from 40 to 40, toity, and who were now being born down upon, slowly but surely by the fanatical adherents of trebizond, local paper and an untethered goat. First, like with the people who made miniature cardboard hens, and place them on the sides of path. Second, they executed the very name of creber zondo. Culpepper regularly every night, in fact, as they sat around their brazier of hot coals, staring at the moon, if it was visible through the clouds, if the moon was not visible, they shut their eyes. They would sit quite still, for so long, the birds would nest in their hair and Moss grow up on their feet. There were more than 100 of them, and they worship nothing, not even the tethered goat. They had so cruelly abandoned backup fought hoity. Why did they not take the goat with them as they fled? This is the kind of question the out of print pamphleteer Dobson would have addressed hadn't been alive at the time of which I speak. But he was yet to be born. It is hard for us to imagine a world without Dobson a world where inexplicable things could happen did happen, and there was no hastily scribbled pamphlet issued within days or weeks to make sense of events. how one would have longed for even a few precious pages entitled, why those who fled fought hoity for fought toity to escape the fanatical adherents of crabbers on both Culpepper cruelly abandoned that tethered guilt with footnotes and a map. A map could certainly have been abused to the pursuers the beginning lottery lost on that barren plain. Try as they might they could not find fort toity. They wandered for months led by the goat until their confectionery bags were empty and the batteries on bins portable metal Tapping Machine were dead. They were far from home, exhausted and hungry, and increasingly rancorous. Pembroke cat in particular, was thoroughly frazzled and Doctor poking his fellows with a pointy stick until I took it away from him and stamped on his toes until he promised to desist and desist. He did. They fell victim to an aid you sweating and shaking and in babbling, incoherent gibberish, bam accused him of having a spurious, a you to elicit sympathy. Diocletian said, This is not the first time you have made an accusation of spurious au bam. Do you have an A Day Fix? Bam replied, Yes, I do. Is that so wrong? But Pembroke it Aigoo was all too real. And it was on the Thursday morning he expired out on that plane, that the fanatical adherents of credit on Bo Culpepper were plunged into despair. One by one night perished, and Wyndham perished the cult of trebizond, called pepper.

Frank Key  26:56
And I'd like to end this week, and the show this week with a quotation from lectures on language by William S. bouche. It will be absurd and ridiculous to suppose that any person, however great or learned, or wise, could employ the language correctly, without a knowledge of the things expressed by that language. It would not be like the sweet notes of the coral songsters of the grove for a warble hymns of gratitude to God, not like the boding of the distant owl, for that tells the profound solemnity of night, not like the hungry lion roaring for his prey, for that tells of death and plunder. Not like the distant notes of the Clarion for that tells of blood and Carnage, of tears and anguish, of widowhood and orphanage. It can be compared to nothing but a Bible of confusion in which their own folly is worth confounded. Well, that's telling them whoever they are. Maybe person to me as well. What babbling anyway, that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I should be back next week. Whether coughing or not, and I'll read some more stuff to you. Bye bye.
