Good evening, my name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com if you're listening on a computer, or similar device, and I hadn't knowingly been to a freakout, but having listened to that crack, john played Barlow, my surgery, I think, I think I'd like to go to a freak out. So if you could arrange that for me, john, will be most desire. I'll need a time machine I think. Okay. Well, I'm sure but not beyond your wit. So yes, this is hunting yard. And, as usual, I'm going to read to you for about 20 minutes or so. And I'd like to begin this week with an extract or nursery rhyme, which is from the 1956 bump book of anti communist Nursery Rhymes published in the United States. In that year, sorry, 60 years old. Lawson Maude went up the hill To fetch a pail of water last fell down on clunked, his crown and mod came tumbling after they rolled and tumbled further down, tumbling pell mell till they came bumping to a halt down in the dingley Dell. In the Dell worked the grumpy man who carried them off to his cave, but fear not tinies for laws was bold and Maude was very brave. They shook their little fists and Borg and rent the sky asunder and made the grunty man commit a very foolish blunder. He dropped them at the cave mouth while he went to have a fight and illegal boxing match under the cover of the night. The grumpy man was pitted against an awful dreadful fall. None other than this peep, affectionately known as little bow. She looked so pale and timorous, actually packed a hefty punch, and often bashed a dozen ogres before she had her lunch. So when the grunty man stalked off to meet his nemesis lauzon mod ran off into the arms of Alger Hiss. Yes, our jaw hit the communists spy from Washington DC, Bane and Roland, stylish, dressed up to a tee. He took the top to a meeting of his fellow traveling reds, where Stalinist propaganda turned their pointy little heads. They went back to the cave and found the grumpy man covered in Gore. Little Bo Peep had backed him up, then backed him up some more. They recruited him to their cause to overthrow the state said laws or mod, we must act before it is too late. So laws and more than the grantee man went back to the dingley Dell and hid some microfilm secrets at the bottom of the well. But they were caught by Nixon, indefatigable in his zest to places many reds as possible under house arrest. He can find them to a house or top of the hill, then climbed by climbed from water, a solid and a sturdy house well built from bricks and mortar, like the house of the three little pigs that withstood lupine huff and puff, but laws and more than the grumpy man were communists. Sure enough, so when the big bad wolf hoeve interview from over hills, they sang in praise of Stalin, and then swallowed their cyanide pills. And so the state was safe once more from communist infiltration, and Nixon was bathed in the praise of a relieved and grateful nation. The grantee man and Lars and Maude were buried and forgot that Richard Milhouse Nixon, he is not.

Yes, a reminder that in two days time on Saturday, February, the third attains the resonance annual fundraiser begins and runs until the 21st of February, featuring nine days of large events, a spectacular online auction, as well as a whole host of special broadcasts, one of which will be the opera hour, pull the plug and hooting out on the air, all backed into one, two hours of fun and frolic with me and john and Richard, something to look forward to that this time next week. And remember, resonance relies on the support of our listeners. So help us make more amazing programming by heading to resonance FM to make a contribution. They'll also be I think, in fact, it's already live on online is the fundraising option, which has many exciting, exciting things that you can bid for. One of which is to come and sit in and enjoy the hooting yard show in the studio, and then go for a cup of tea with me afterwards. Worth several thousand pounds of anyone that money I would have thought I suppose I better get on with it Really? and redo something else. So just bear with me. Yes, here it is. This is an old favorite. It's about eight years old actually, but I think I'd like to read it to you. Once upon a time, I was scrambling down the lower reaches of a mountainside through Shing Dylan's Gumball and Bracken. When I chanced upon a tosspot bivouac. It was a surprisingly well made bivouac using branches from large and beach and bladder, nut and sycamore trees to form a roof upon which sufficient foliage had been impacted to provide Sterling shelter from hail storms and tempests. Although the weather was in fact spectacularly, Clement Clement to was the name of the tosspot. As I soon learned, for I immediately struck up a conversation with him, as is my habit. When I encounter mountainside people learned that he had taken to his bivouac after fleeing, fleeing from what I asked, but he seemed reluctant to tell me someone with a less acute insight into human nature than I might have put this down to coyness. But I spent many years studying and Gladion Dempster. So I know, I knew there was more than simple shyness behind his diffident mutterings, and I determined to Winkle the full story out of him.

Frank Key  08:01
So, I grabbed the top spot around the neck with one of my huge bear like hands, lifted him off his feet, and shook my other huge bear like hand made into a fist, in front of his face, as dance to taught by attuning ones fist shaking to a very precise rhythm. The half strangled subject is quickly placed in what gladly termed a confessional brain zone, akin to having been injected with a truth serum. As I suggested, it took years of training to perfect the technique, and I'm afraid a large number of fully strangled hamsters and stoats like buried in the ground of the Institute. Five minutes later, I was fully apprised of the reasons why the tosspot had fled to his mountainside bivouac. He had been employed as an extra in a heist film set on a submarine. Sterling Hayden may have been involved in the production, but this was not entirely clear. What came shining through the tosspot account, however, was the claustrophobic atmosphere on the set, which was actually a real decommissioned submarine. The tenebrous leaking interior had been slightly refurbished to include heist movie essentials, like an intricate security system, and a safe full of gold bullion, but otherwise it remained cramped and hot and riddled with cranking machinery. After six days filming, during which time he had to lean against a damaged pump looking more than the tosspot had cracked, tearing off his sub Marla's green tunic and cap. He stumbled out of the submarine swam to the surface of the tank in which it was docked, scrambled up a ladder to the studio canteen and fled until he reached the mountainside where With unaccustomed competence, he constructed his bivouac using already fallen branches from large and beach and bladder knot and sycamore trees and the foliage there of where I bumped into him as I scrambled down from the mountain peak, upon which I had been making an invaluable study of the nesting habits of the mountain fuckwit. Later, I was to discover that the continuity person on the film set distraught at the vanishing of Clement to the tosspot, and unable to find anyone of a similar physiognomy to lean against the damage pump looking more than advise the producer to abandon the project. It remained unclear whether this producer was Sterling Hayden, or possibly Hume Cronin. Either way, the film was never finished. I put down the top bottom gave him a look of reproach and then I carried on down the mountainside in sadness and sorrow.

Yeah, before we go on just one other another date for your diary, if you've got any money left by the end of the end of the resonance fundraiser, which you probably won't have, when all things are considered. But if you've got a spare five or leftover that you haven't given to a resonance, which is unlikely, but possible, you could come to a brewers bar at a 77 shackle well, lane, Dalston, London eight, at eight o'clock on Wednesday, I think it's Wednesday, the ninth of March, not a march breath bar shacklewell line where you'll have a rare opportunity to see me reading stuff in a live context as opposed to on the radio. I'll be joined by Jonathan Bowman and Richard Thomas. And yeah, so that's March the ninth brewers bar shacklewell line, Dalston, eight o'clock, five pounds. I really don't know what else to say. Apart from that, I should point out that it's a one in a series or a monthly series of spoken word events, organized by Jonathan Bowman and Richard Thomas. So there's one at around the same time every month, and in March, I will feature me so do come along. And if you'd like to hear me reading various bits and pieces I may or may not read this. I was commissioned to write a fat book in titled meetings with remarkable buntings. by row poised I was about to set to work. When it occurred to me that I didn't know whether I was meant to be writing about birds, or those decorative strings of triangular flags for student festive occasions, such as gala days. I rang the publishers to find out. The person I spoke to sounded about 12 years old and was brimming with confidence in spite of being clueless. As soon as I uttered the word bird, she started to babble excitedly about something called Twitter. I slammed the phone down. I was able to do this because I was using a proper telephone, one with a receiver resting on a cradle. With these newfangled mobile horrors, one cannot slam them down in a satisfying spat of ill temper without risking breakage. I decided my best bet was to write about both types of bunting. And with the twittery inanities of the publishers sloshing in my ears, took up my borrow to write about the bird. But then I paused the title of the book spoke of meetings. With buntings, I would have to go and find a bunting and commune with it. Now my all of the logic of ignorance is staggering. And frankly, I wouldn't know a bunting from a nut hat or a puppet or a Starling or wagtail. So I rang the emergency bird information hotline. The person who answered the phone sounded about 12 years old and was brimming with avian confidence. I told her I wanted to know all there was to know about buntings. Do you mean the bird or the decorative strings of triangular flags for student at festive occasions, such as gala days? she asked. Well, you'll be emergency bird information hotline, I said. So I mean, the bird obviously. It might seem obvious to you, she said, but you'd be surprised how many inquiries we receive about the decorative strings of triangular flags. We're a very festive organization forever holding fates and gardeners. And so we have bunting hanging permanently outside our headquarters. I think that's why people call us when they want to know about non bird bonding, as well as about bonding the bird. Well, I want to know about the bird I said, but she was prattling on regardless. Actually, we're having a little garden party this afternoon. She said in celebration of the common chaffing would you like to come you'll be able to see our display of bunting the decorative strings of triangular flags that is rather than the birds. But there will be a couple of stuffed chaffinches for you to look at if you want to know more about them.

Frank Key  16:48
I want to know about the bunting, not the chaffinch, I shouted, and I slammed the phone down again. In my rather satisfying stateville temper. I went for a walk by the pond and chucked pebbles at swans. Then it occurred to me that I ought to attend the garden party so I could commune with the non bird banding. Then at least I would have something to write about. I promised home and rang the emergency bird information hotline again. A robotic voice in for me, but the line had been disconnected. I prepared I repaired to my SP tra and picked up my borrow. Over the course of my life. I have met many remarkable buntings I wrote lying shamelessly. But who would ever know? none more so perhaps, Van bunting, the Swedish half breeds gimel horse which became a filmstar. Bunting played Pippi Longstocking horse, Lila Gabon in a series of films directed by Allah Herod bomb. Of course, I had never actually met panting and my knowledge of horses is as patchy as my knowledge of birds. But I felt I was getting to grips with my material, birds and those decorative strings of triangle of flags for stoned festive occasions such as gala days and emergency bird information hotline garden parties in celebration of the common cabbage could take a backseat for the time being. By the time I'd finished with bunting, the film star horse, we would be firm friends and boon companions, at least within my head. I made a mental note to ring the publisher and suggest we amend the title of my book to meetings with remarkable buntings inside my head. Then I carried on writing Dalio, like a man possessed of unfathomable horse based inventive genius.

I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I think I have the makings of a lecture when the singing teacher I am to pedagogy as a duck to water. There is nothing that cannot be taught by ferocious spittle. flecked shouting accompanied by thumps on the head with a big stick. It is true that my field of expertise is ornithology, not singing. But I have taught even the most recalcitrant dimwit do identify four different types of bird with as near as dammit, a 25% success rate. The birds were a swan, an owl, a Wren, and an ostrich. I'd like to teach the world to sing. And the world is rather larger than the classroom in the cellar of Pang Hill orphanage, where I currently teach. In fact, I've never taught anywhere else as far as I can recall. And I have rarely taught anything other than bird identification skills, apart from occasional occasions, sorry.

Frank Key  21:03
Excuse me. In fact, I've never taught anywhere else as far as I can recall. And I have rarely taught anything other than bird identification skills. Apart from occasional sessions of boot scrubbing, mucking about with source burns, and guttural German. But pedagogic courses through my veins like blood. The more recalcitrant dimwits among the orphans often develop nosebleeds after my thumping, so I know what blood looks like, even though it's not my field of expertise. Another reason I'm well suited to the task of teaching the world to sing is that I awake every morning with a song in my heart. Often it's a tuneless and monotonous dirge, which is the best I can muster when I wake in a foul temper, as I usually do. My attic bedroom at Pang Hill orphanage is dark and dismal and icy cold, even at the height of summer. I've been told this has something to do with local atmospheric conditions. But such conditions are out with my field of expertise, so I cannot judge the truth of the claim. Sometimes, a frail and freezing Robin will come and perch on my window sill of a morning. I think it's a Robin, though it's difficult to tell through the grease and grind the smeared window, but at the site or be blurred of a feathered friend. The song in my heart is a cheerier and more up tempo one, such as withered and died by Richard and Linda Thompson. Before I teach the world the sing then I will make a start by teaching the orphans to sing. But before I teach the orphans to sing, I will hone my singing teacher techniques shouting big stick by teaching monkeys to sing. There is a monkey house at Pang hills Zoo over on the other side of the hill beyond the viaduct. Through bribery and threats, I obtained a key to the monkey house. I think the janitor who passed me the key assumed I wanted to gain access to the monkeys for unseemly purposes. Well, let him think what he likes. I will betray him to the zoo authorities in any case, and he will languish in a prison cell while I teach the monkeys to sing. uptight. I have discovered that most of the monkeys in the monkey house at Pang hills Zoo are howler monkeys. They can already how their little heads off like nobody's business. My work is done.

Finally, this week, I'm in for blood Delson, the 2007 Danish TV crime thriller, which is not pronounced like that, but God knows how the Danes pronounce it. Anyway, it was known here as the killing. There was a minor character appearing in just three of the 20 episodes named canoed pad. I confess that I've forgotten pretty much everything about the character but for his name, but what a name, nude pad or short Tie of his own spin off series. I can imagine him dapper in his Danish dad's as one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Alongside Lars and Bengt and Eric, a quartet of impossibly sophisticated Scandinavians, Nobel of brow and fond of herring. I'm assuming, of course, that North men can refer to any old Scandinavian, not exclusively those from Norway. But if we had to export canoed pad and his fellows from Denmark to Norway, then so be it. We could, after all, put them on the banks of a few word. What would the apocalypse look like? viewed from a few word? I asked. fueled and apocalypse expert towels and bookbinder phase thoughts. He never called me back. I think he was taking a very long bath in his tub, listening to a cassette tape of inspirational speeches by Patricia Fripp, sister of the guitarist Robert husband of pop strong toyah Wilcox toys big it was it's a mystery, and I think the canoed pad TV series ought to have a mystery element. The mystery could be some unspoken horror in canoed pads past, or in louses past or banked past or Eric's past, or perhaps in the past have all four of them. The unspoken horror that brought the four of them together in the first place, on the banks of a fjord in a high an icy wind, noble of brow, and fond of herring. And that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. If you've got any, if you'd like to make any script suggestions for canoed pad, the TV show, do send them in. You can Yeah, come talk to them. You can bid on bid at the resonance auction already. Even though the fundraiser starts on Saturday. You can come and see me and live performance on March the ninth and go to the routing yard website to read all this stuff yourself. That's all I have time for this week. See you next week. For the whatever we're going to call it the opera our pull the plug hooting yard special Bye bye.
