Hello campus, I'm sure someone must be listening while sitting in a tent on a windswept hillside with the canvas flapping in the wind. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. I have a dislike of inappropriate buttons, whether it's buttons for decoration, clothes with too many buttons for the function required, or just all buttons. They leave me feeling uncomfortable like clowns or Victorian medical equipment. That that was that was me speaking but that wasn't late. That was a letter in yesterday's Guardian from someone called Cameron Smith of Barcelona. And what's all about anyway, Mr. Smith will be pleased to know that hooting yards inappropriate buttons helpline should be up and running in the near future. Once we our staff have fully trained counselors have been through their full training session in this important field of mental and emotional well being. But enough of buttons. The last couple of weeks I've begun the show with a song and I thought I should do the same thing again. This is a Brechtian see Shanti used to be sung in music halls in the golden age of the music hall. So best really imagined in a in a sort of chirpy, crappy cockney accent or the you know, the kind of accent David Bowie used to use in the in the 60s. There's a blighter eating bloaters He won't have no mayonnaise. He hates continental sources and continental ways. He never wears a berry nor string and nor strings onions around his neck. He's a bloater eating blighter dancing hornpipes on the deck for his assailing blighter on the good ship Marmaduke. He ate so many bloaters that soon he starts to puke. He vomits on the orlok deck and again upon the poop. The other sailors pick him up and track him in the soup. By soup of course I mean the sea The kerning broiling sea and the blighter eating bloaters while in truth, that man was me, I puke two more and then I swam until I reached the shore. It was a continental shore I lummi. gov, a law. Now I must eat mayonnaise and continental sources. But now at last are mindful of globalizing forces. So give me sauces and condiments to accompany my bloaters and I will explain all about socio economic motors, the engines of commerce and exchange and all sorts of trades. Give me my breakfast floaters and don't stint on mayonnaise.

That's probably gonna be some more about mayonnaise. later in the show for the mayonnaise rivals Manju. This mean but before Ben, this is called Adventures of the pointy head detectives. The pointy head detectives had very few adventures. much of their time was spent reclining upon demands code rotating an activity not conducive to venturesome antics. And we're not code rotating directed most of their energies towards the precise disposition of the demand within their so called deduction chamber, and Illa pointed room offer remote corridor on an otherwise deserted story of the police headquarters annex on the far side of town. Sometimes they determined that the vans were best placed in regular geometric formation at other times that they were best scattered Higgledy Piggledy in the available space. On Easter Sundays and other Christian festivals. The pointy head detectives experimented with divan arrangement somewhere between orderly and chaotic. They had never been able to settle upon an optimum disposition. For they were only too aware that some crimes were best solved with the demands lined up in a row or in a stellar pattern, while other crimes were cracked when the demands were arranged haphazardly. But one thing they all agreed upon was the effectiveness of their cerebral approach as pointy headed detectives reclining upon demands smoking their pipes looking to the untrained eye, as if they were half asleep and lost in latitude. So when a Cubs Scribbler from, let's out to wit, brainy criminals magazine was dispatched to police headquarters to interview the pointy head detectives and to write up their adventures for a feature article. He was rapidly plunged into despair. There were only so many ways of describing a pointy head detective reclining upon a divan, cogitating before repeating oneself. Even discussions about the disposition of the demands were carried out quietly and thoughtfully and without rancor or fistfights. The Scribbler slumped in a corner of the deduction chamber and wept salt tears. He went unnoticed by the pointy head detectives who were sprawled on their divan cogitating about the latest enormity, they were set to solve the case of the poisoned well, that poison well. The poor weeping Scribbler was terrified that unable to craft an exciting piece of prose from such an exciting material, he would be dismissed from his position in those parts that time, it was the lot of dismissed scribblers to be sent to the frontier to dig drainage ditches. What could save him from such a fate? He had but one recourse and that was to rely on the power of his imagination. The Scribbler hurried back to his Cubby, and wrote a wholly fictional account of the point he had detectives. fighter jets screamed across the sky as the point he had detectives teetered on the edge of the erupting volcano. He scribbled boiling hot lava lapping up their stylish Winkle pickers. The Dowty threesome no foursome no fivesome did Dowty daring doings with much shouting and screaming and you relating but always with a purpose. Evil wrongdoers trembled in their hideaways. As the pointy head detectives came crashing down from the volcano but in human speed, armed with magnetic Ray guns. The wind howled and the sun bashed the earth with brilliance. That Captain at clear off guard and the team commandeered a fantastically fast sports car and sped across the plains towards the scene of criminality. Not even the cataclysms of earthquake monsoon and the coming to pass of ancient biblical prophecy could stop them. swatting aside the locusts storms, the pointy head detectives descended upon poison well, and Nam to the perb just as he tried to escape in his rocket ship.

Your neck, cried Lieutenant tetes pivac strewing the bureaucratically approved verbal rigmarole of less venturesome detectives. Fly, exclaimed the poison well, poet well poisoner caught red handed. It's a fair cop, a no mistake.

There was much more in this vein, and the editor of left out with brainy criminals magazine was delighted sales of the magazine sword, and in both fashionable salons and sordid middens. All anybody could talk about was the brave, charismatic pointy head detectives. There was gossip about a feature film and a television series. The cub Scribbler was commissioned to write further adventures, and he did not disappoint. Week after week, he recounted entirely fictional thrills and spills about the threesome. No foursome, no fivesome Careful to slip in just enough real world fact to give his yarns an air of verisimilitude. The fervor reached such a pitch that eventually came to the attention of the notoriously dim chief of police. This big medaled fellow built like a walrus with a moustache to match, decided to pay a visit to his crack crime fighting team in their ill appointed room of a remote corridor on an otherwise deserted story of the police headquarters annex on the far side of town. He was astonished on that rain last Thursday morning to find the supposedly heroic pointy head detectives reclining on demands code rotating. Where is the doubt in us? Where the derring do he wailed his Captain at clear off guard. We're in the middle of solving the despicable slaughter of the Innocents down by sawdust bridge. The chief of police flailed his arms to disperse the fog of pipe smoke and shouted his head off. You ought to be down at sawdust bridge then to the teeth, sniffing out clues and ready to snap the cuffs on the perp after a spot of sickening violence, preferably at the very same time as a sea monster emerges dripping from the river and wreaks havoc in the vicinity as would happen in those popular magazine reports. He cried. So cerebral where the pointy head detectives so removed from the petty concerns of the workaday world, they remained quite ignorant of their newfound fame. They had no idea what their chief was talking about. furrowing their brows even deeper, they sank further into the plush upholstery of the demands, and code rotated more furiously. Now the chief of police, like many a dim walrus mustache official in both fact and fiction was not given to considered reflection. Considered reflection, he made snap decisions and blended on regardless. So it was that he set a climax on roaring hustled the point he had detectives out into the rain, set fire to the demands, and had the deduction chamber locked and bolted placing scary has kept the signage out sided for good measure. Get the hens to sawdust bridge he screamed and solved the crime in an exciting and blood curdling manner. Or I'll have your guts for garters. perplexed and befuddled, the fivesome trudged away. As soon as they were out of sight of the truth, they lay down on a sopping wet lawn reignited their pipes and resumed their code rotations. They were still code rotating A few hours later, when the rains ceased, and a sharp and a shaft of brilliant sunlight broke through the clouds illuminating just behind them. A terrible scene. The cubs Scribbler now grown rich and preening by dint of his success was strolling across the lawn, dressed to the nines in a top hat, and a brand new silken boffo splendido Italianate suit, when he was set upon by a whirling tangle of ruffians, who beat him senseless with bludgeons and robbed him and stripped him of clothes and cash and chucked him into the swollen roaring river, and cackle evil cackles as they did so, and then went further marauding, attacking nearby orphans and puppies and glorying in their criminality.

Code rotating upon the wet lawn, the pointy head detectives remained utterly oblivious to the enormity is taking place just yards away. The clouds dispersed on Thursday afternoon was sunny with a light breeze.

beckoned me I answered it summons I followed it towards the drains there by the gutter next to the drains. It began to drool. I shuddered as one shudders when confronted by a goal. The drains stank. The ghoul stank to from the sprig in my fist, I handed it a chrysanthemum. It took the flower in its ghostly claw and trapped it into the drains. Oh, in great ghoul in great ghoul. I turned my back on the stinking Phantom and pranced away contemptuous, like a flop. It does not do to show contempt to a ghoul from behind, it cracked me and it's cold, spindly arms, and 12 be round and flung me into the drains. I dropped my sprig of chrysanthemums. Oh, scattered sprig, scattered sprig sprawled in the drains. I saw the ghoul shimmer and vibrate and shapeshift before my eyes, it was become a pig. It grunted once and trotted away towards its die. I lay in the drains and stared up at the sky. Immense and blue and blank. I know birds sing

as promised. Another thing about mayonnaise, which includes mayonnaise. On Thursday last while crossing through the park, the parson was unhorsed and fell into a haha. torrential rainfall during the previous week had filled the ditch with puddles. And when he clambered out, the parson was sopping wet. his horse had galloped away and was nowhere to be seen. So the parson faced the prospect of having to walk the many miles back to his parsonage. The weather remained inclement, although it was no longer raining. At this juncture, the person felt the presence of the uncanny just behind him. He spun around and saw an angel. its wings were fold, its locks were golden, in one hand, held a jar of mayonnaise in the other a bottle of bleach. The Parson was surprised to note that it will black leather gloves. Take this jar, and take this bottle, said the angel. So mellifluous was it to voice that the passen near swooned, he reached out and took the mayonnaise and the bleach, and as soon as he did so, the angel vanished, where it had stood, there was a haze of gaseous mist. The possum was so perplexed. Just then, as astronomers had foretold, there was a partial eclipse of the sun. And as seismologists had foretold, a minor earthquake shook the ground on which the past and stood he nearly toppled over, and would have fallen back into the haha and possibly smashed the jar on the bottle, both of which were glass, but he was a parcel of stupendous balance. All the more surprising that he had been unhorsed. The partial eclipse made the park dark, but in its jar, the mayonnaise had a Creamy Glow. The possum held it aloft, and it lit him on his way as he began his long journey home.

having read the piece aloud to your class, posits the following questions allow the time indicated in each case for the tinies to scratch their answers upon their slides. Why do you think the parson was unhorsed? 30 seconds what kind of angels would wear gloves 30 seconds How likely is it that an Eclipse and an earthquake would happen at the same time? 15 seconds. Why did the angel present the possum with a bottle of bleach? 90 seconds. Do you think the horse found its own way back to the parsonage 30 seconds of which noble gases would the haze of mist be composed 120 seconds. Now, get the class to retell the story in such a way that the parson and the angel and the horse all swap roles, six hours

to what noble cause kind of man devoted energies and talents and the bafflement of clothings to the pursuit both noble and perilous, but then do not all noble deeds contain at least a trace element of peril. That, perhaps is an inquiry for another time, when the moon is high and fires are late and the cocoa has been poured into the cocoa cups and stirred stirred well with the cocoa spoon. The peril inherent in the battlement of clothings Genis lies in the brute fact that the source of most clothings is high up in towers, and towers, even the strongest of them, however solidly they are built, will crumble in time crumble to ruin. Once ruin has come, all clothings cease. We are concerned with that period before after ruination when the tower still stands just about when it teeters in high winds, when masonry is dislodged, by the frantic of crows and bat, when crumble, mint is slow, but certain, then you will hear still be atrocious. clothings then you are called noble valiant in the face of peril to be muffled as best you can. Wait Dennis, wait, your agility is admirable, but it will not do to go skittering up the side of that crumbling tower speedy as a spider in just your fair isle sweater and ski jumpers, leggings and chelsea boots and equipped with what do you intend to be muffle the clothings Ah, now you realize the drawbacks of your impact us and then come, we shall repair to the hanger wherein is kept a startling array of this and that. See, here there is cotton wool and wool and large blankets and either down or to lagging meant for hot pipes, costumers maths and much similar material. All of it just the ticket for the achievement of your noble pursuit. improvised a sling around your shoulders, Dennis with string or ribbons. You must keep your arms free to clamber yet you must carry up stuffings for the battlement and if God help you, you should lose your footing and plunge to Earth before you reach the top of the tower. Such stuffings will soften the impact. bruising there will be but no broken bones no groaning on a pallet in a clinic on a hill.

It was a high tower, ancient and crumbling. I thought it was for Dennis and I to Don hats of hardness as we knelt down in it to looming to weigh a prayer before he climbed. Then we stood and shook hands the noble impetuous young kid, and he's no less noble Parson, and he was up defying gravity impervious to peril. Oh, so valiant. So misty was the morn he was soon out of sight. I shoved marshmallows into my ears against the awful clothings and lists a cigarette high above at the very top of the tower, mango weighted mango, maddened by clothings definitely hunchbacked distressingly twisted and shriveled and vile, leaping about possessive in human strength and the savagery of a bird of prey, mango waited. I ground the butt of my cigarette beneath my boots and turned away and walked jaunty and carefree and lascivious off along the towpath of the canal towards Dennis's dilapidated, but homely heart to pay my respects to his widow.
