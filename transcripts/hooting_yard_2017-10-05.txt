Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting out on the air. The other day, I was scuttling as one does across the floors of silent sees. There is no light down there and it was cold and very wet. But that's the bottom of the sea for you. It's no picnic. Though I've had my fair share of picnics in the cold and wet. I recall one particular childhood picnic where the lid was left off the marmalade jar, and soon enough it contained half marmalade, half rainwater, I was an inquisitive child, I screwed the lid back on the jar, and shook it violently. Until the two substances, the marmalade and the rainwater were mixed together. Years later, I wrote a book about this experiment called marmalade and rainwater. Some of you may know of it, it was a best seller and won several prestigious awards, including the pre poo bell. With the money I received for that I was able to buy an Alpine chalet with its own private funicular railway. Success prompted the idea that I could mind my memories of childhood picnics for further books. I began work on a fictionalized account of one such picnic, provisionally entitled sausages and wasps, but I couldn't make it work. After every few pages, I would grow exasperated and despairing, and scrunch up what I'd written and toss it down on waste shoot, I realized that I was temperamentally incapable of writing about this picnic, even in the guise of fiction, because it had taken place on a hot, dry, sunny day. Whereas what spoke to my imagination was the cold wet picnic. It seemed as though that readers prefer their literary picnics dry and sunny. My second book, more marmalade, and further rainwater was a complete flop, selling fewer than a dozen copies and winning no prizes whatsoever. It did not take long before I faced financial ruin, so I decided to sell up and move elsewhere. But I made the foolish mistake of selling the funicular railway first. This meant I was unable to go to and from the Alpine chalet without paying a hefty fare for each journey to the new owners, a family of goat herds, unparalleled in their capacity. How then, did I get from my high Alpine home to where I am now, lingering in the chambers of the sea. Ah, that will be the subject of my next book, a non picnic based memoir. I am taking my time over it. There will be time, there will be time for 100 visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea. And I shall spread my toast with a mixture of marmalade and rainwater.

If you could talk among yourselves for a moment or stare into space or whatever. I'm having a bit of difficulty finding the next thing I wanted to read to you. But if you if you wait a little while, it will certainly crop up sooner or later. But listen to the music for a bit.

right sorry about that we're back on course. Um, the I mentioned the other day a family of God not the other day I mentioned in the piece I just read a family of goat herds unparalleled in their capacity. So let me tell you a bit more about them. There is a song about her buying the goat herd with which I'm sure many of you are familiar. The goat herd is usually represented by a puppet. We're fortunate to have a picture indeed film of the lonely goat herd puppet. For there are other noteworthy goat herd puppets of which no images exist, are referred to the blocks a family of goat herds unparalleled in their capacity. shadow puppets of whom were devised by the shadow puppeteer dressed by Wiens wings told the story of the blocks through the medium of shadow puppetry, versus retell it here using words. The blocks had been goat herds in the Swiss Alps for generations. Their lives were and always had been narrow, pinched and poor. Then one day in 1964, the current patriarch of the family, Hans blot, came upon a newspaper report of a meeting of British Labour Party politicians. One of their number George Brown had apparently made reference to the gnomes of Zurich. His interest piqued, hands blocked read further, and learn that these gnomes residing in Switzerland's largest city were exceedingly wealthy. Hands blood, who was a goat herd unparalleled in his rapacity saw an opportunity to turn around his family's fortunes. Instead of scraping a living herding goats. The bots could borrow money from the gnomes of Zurich, and well, he did not immediately form a plan, but he felt sure that he could turn a modest loan from the gnomes into an enormous pile of cash, somehow or other given his unparalleled capacity. Block did not set off for Zurich right away. First, he drove the family in the tenets of anthroposophy as expounded by Rudolf Steiner. This was necessary blocked thought, because he assumed the gnomes of Zurich were the invisible gnomes, who live among men but cannot be perceived by the common riffraff, such as goat herd, only becoming visible to those on a higher plane of human existence, such as Rudolf Steiner himself. But blot driven by their unparalleled rapacity studied hard, and before long, believing they might now be able to perceive the invisible knowns set off the Zurich. Upon arrival, they trooped into the first bank they saw and were delighted when they realized they could see the gnomes with absolute clarity. Hans blot proceeded to ask for a loan of money. Vova gnomes of Zurich who were of course, not Rudolph Stein area knowns at all and were visible to everybody. And no, they did not lend money out willy nilly. They recognize the great the gleam of greed in Hans blot eyes. Such unparalleled rapacity they felt was worthy of their regard. The blocks left Zurich with pockets full of cash. As winter drew in, they spent long evenings huddled in their noise, some goat herders hovel, trying to think up ways to use the loan to, in the words of an accountant, generate a regular revenue stream. Then, on a blizzard rock night, one of the younger blots host to the Hansi story, as well patriots so grandfather had a brainwave you know, just up the mountain, she babbled in excitement, there is a chalet there is the chalet of the pre poo Belle winning writer and Kay freaky. He has his own private funicular railway. We could buy it from him and then gouge oodles of cash by charging exorbitant funicular railway fares.

All the blocks agreed this was a brilliant idea. And over the next five years by bought more and more funicular railways, not only in the Swiss Alps, but in the Austrian and Italian Alps, too, and the Carpathians and they charge their passengers ever increasing fares, for journeys up and down those sublines no top peaks. But santra their unparalleled rapacity. The blocks were reluctant ever depart with a pfennig when it came time to repay their loan to the gnomes of Zurich. The blot simply ignored the demands that plopped through the letterbox of their Alpine hovel. Eventually, the gnomes of Zurich lost patience. After a secretive conference in a secret chamber in their secretive bank, the gnomes of Zurich fastened upon a terrible resolution by hired a gang of invisible Rudolf Steiner Aria knowns, who one night, burst unperceived into the blots hovel, and slaughtered them in their bed, it can everyone from hand to hand see. The foregoing cannot, of course, do justice to the vivid shadow puppetry of Jasper Wiens shadow puppet version of this story of the blood family, but I hope it's afforded you a modicum of entertainment.

We take our text with today's lesson, the Gospel of Matthew chapter 10. First 29 are not two sparrows sold for a fathering and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father. Sometimes it so happens that you will go to a sparrow seller to make purchase of a pair of sparrows, only them to state an asking price of more than a fathering. Or he might charge a fathering for a single Sparrow. But throw in a second Sparrow, with a buy one get one free offer, in which case you will pay a farthing for two sparrows, even if the ones borrow cost of filing in itself. There again, you might find yourself being offered a free Sparrow, by a seller of sight. partridges or limits who has an unwanted stock of sparrows, and cannot wait to be rid of them. For they are greedily eating up his grain and millet that he would rather feed his partridges all in it. So when we asked the question as we must, are not two sparrows sold for a fathering? The answer is no, not always. Not in all circumstances Come what may, for there may be times and places where we will be asked to pay more or less for a pair of sparrows. And from this, we can learn much about the ways of God and man. Yes, the honest Sparrow seller will heart will hand us to sparrows upon receipt of a farthing. But not all Sparrow sellers are honest, while some Sparrow sellers are too honest, for their own good. And as with Sparrow sellers, so to those from whom we buy other birds, not just partridges a minute, but starlings and kitty wakes and seagulls. But what is the second part of the verse from Matthew 10? That one? Sorry, but what are the second part of the verse from Matthew 10, that one of them that is the sparrows, that one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father? The first part of the verse is a question. The second part is not it states quite vehemently and unchallengeable. Lee that without your father, one of the sparrows will not fall to the ground. But which of the sparrows Is it that shall not fall, one of them will and one of them will remain in the air in flight and birdie swooping until your father appears, at which point we must assume it will plunge towards the earth just because your father has arrived. The more one studies this passage, and I have studied it for years and years, the more problems it raises. Why does one Sparrow fall on the ground without your father? Why does the other Sparrow fall on the ground when your father appears? Is your father armed with a shotgun or a catapult? Does his mere presence in goose in the tiny frail Sparrow a heart attack? And if he can have that effect on a sparrow, one of other birds, partridges say, or linnets, or starlings or kittiwakes, or sea goals, or Robbins, or Rennes, or even hummingbirds? These are profound questions and we must dig deep to answer them deeper certainly then a sparrow may need to dig to light upon old fat, juicy earthworm for its morning snack. My own experience has taught me that all that digging will be as Nord unless one has first found a sparrow seller to sell one a pair of sparrows for a filing. I've asked in this day and age more leaden than golden. Such Sparrow sellers are rare indeed. rarer even than the proverbial hen's teeth. But the hand is quite another class of bird from a sparrow, as you will know, if you have ever kept poultry. Thus saith the LORD

Tra la la diddily diddily. De, I've misread that. I'm sorry, my eyesight is not very good. So I have difficulty reading. Even big type. I'll start again, tra la ma Diddley dip CD book, there goes a person of unhinged mean, but does an unhinged mean be token and unhinged mind? Let us find out. Let us follow him on his way better follow him to the ends of the earth. But the earth has no end. It is a globe and one can go round and round and round and round and round forever. Or until one drops panting with exhaustion without ever reaching an end. Yes, yes I no one can come to a strand or for land or a cliff and be faced with the sea. So vast, so wet, so merciless, but one simply hops into a boat, any old tub will do and sooner or later, there will be more land upon which to proceed. There are no end. So let us follow this person of unhinged mean wherever he should roam. And if he hops into a boat Well, we too shall hop into a boat. But not the same boat boat. It would not sit well with our sense of safety to be alone aboard a boat with a person of unhinged mean is unhinged by be of maniacal bent and under that cloak of his he may be armed with weaponry. lethal weaponry, think a sharp sword or perhaps a loaded blunderbuss think upon that, though it does not bear thinking about for we could end up with fatal wounds, toppling from the boat into the sea there to flail helplessly and drown if he is indeed a maniac better by far to hop into a second different boat and follow. We need not even navigate simply stay the same course as is being stared by the person of unhinged mean his cloak now swapped for the blazer of a yachtsman. It's fitted to trim to conceal that sword or blunderbuss but he may still be armed. A Dirk in his pocket or a shift tucked up his sleeve ready for the wielding and the blood and the toppling and the flailing and the drowning in that damn knowable sea. Right as follow them as a safe distance until such time as he and we spy land Ahoy and disembark upon it. Mike and this embark upon it might be Golden Sands or it might be wet impacted mud. He swaps his blazer for a Macintosh like Hitler's is he Lola, not dead after all, but on the lam heading for a villa hidden in the mangrove swamps of South America. Of course not. I'm running away with myself. Perhaps I too, am becoming unhinged in mind if not in mean it would not be the first time there was that big bleak sort of black building high on a hill, Pang Hill bow and iron gate, doubly no Tripoli padlocked, where I was kept for years among persons given the raving and gibbering and warders done up in starched white tunics, who patted me on the head and gave me fizzy pop in a plastic beaker, which I slump slurped with gratitude, though, through vote, burn. I'm sorry, I'm having difficulty reading this. I'm going to start that sentence again. Well, that paragraph it would not be the first time there was that big bleak, black building high on a hill, Pang hill behind iron gate, doubly no Tripoli padlocked, where I was kept for years among persons given the riving and gibbering out of waters Dan up in starched white tunics, who patted me on the head and gave me fizzy pop in a plastic beaker, which I slurped with gratitude, though a large portion of pop dribbled down my chinny chin chin, the waters dabbling at it with rags. sometimes at night change to my iron cot. I have fantastic dreams in which I imagine I'm still there, behind high walls on high Pang Hill and not in some faraway land across the vast merciless sea in dogged pursuit of the ends of the earth. of a person of unhinged mean tralala deadly dip CD.

I've mentioned shadow puppetry on this show already. But let's have some guff puppetry equally unsuitable for the radio. And Tuesday well goes berserk is the title of a puppet show created by the noted glove puppeteer.gov pup acts as a companion piece to her earlier award winning show googie withers goes haywire and that's proved equally controversial. Both shows are clearly indebted so the traditional Punch and Judy format with squeaky braying voices and demented violence doctor.gov pup has been forced in both cases to add a prominent program note declaring that any resemblance to actual actresses living or dead is purely coincidental. Tuesday well goes berserk is divided into three acts. In the first, the Tuesday well, glove puppet is presented as calm, placid and peaceable. Indeed, one could say that she is wholly inert. The Better to contrast with the going Berzerk, which follows this opening scene lasts anywhere between four and 14 seconds, depending according to the glove puppeteer on the mood of the audience. enact to Tuesday well gets married to the British pianist actor and comedian Dudley Moore. She then goes berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled with pellets of lead, and then shoving him down and well. Immediately afterwards. Tuesday Weld marries the Israeli violinist and conductor pink acid Zuckerman. She proceeds to go berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled with wet impacted sand and then shoving him down a mineshaft. In Act Three, a police officer attempts to arrest Tuesday Weld, but she scampers away and dressed in a pink duffle coat goes cavorting at nightfall on the beach at deal, skipping about and waving her arms before mincing along the pier and vomiting into the sea. An obvious reference to the haunting image of carry on actor Charles Hawtrey described in the closing pages of all the devil they're here by David Seabrook, Granta 2002. Critics have questioned the absence from the public Show Tuesday Weld first husband clawed hearts.gov pup interview to the magazine. Characters ignored in glove puppet shows weekly hinted that he may appear in a planned prequel glove puppet show, featuring both Tuesday Weld and googie withers. Tuesday Weld goes berserk is currently showing at a temporary kiosk at the end of the pier deal. Admission is free to those wearing pink duffle coats. In the text, just read any resemblance to actual persons living or dead is purely coincidental, except for the reference to Charles Hawtrey, which is from the book on said it was from

that's, that's nearly the end of this week's show. There's that I thought I might read you. Well, I'm going to try and write to you something else before we before we close. If I can find it, I'm having a bit of thick. I'm having difficulty reading this week and also finding the things I want to read, which is quite annoying, but you'll just have to put up with it. And I know you will. Because I'm about to find what I wanted to read to you. I've often mentioned on this show, the poet Dennis beer pint. I'm the only person who actually knows anything about web, Dennis Pierpont who lives and breathes and has his being and but I'm very glad to note that he just had a new book of poetry out and I thought I would read it to you. Well, not the whole book, obviously. But to close to close this week show. A new poem or a bit of verse by Dennis beer point. Oh cloak of night, in shroud my hub on which I boil in a pan, a gruul sin to feed my flock. When morning breaks, and they line up, each with his coupon snipped or torn from Christ in extremists magazine brought from the kiosk by the pond, past the crumbling viaduct. Beyond the hen coops and the sump, over the hills, and far away. It's the usual twaddle from Dennis bear pint who way seems to manage to work out some way of mentioning Christ in extremists magazine, which is I thought it was a children's comic, but apparently is a magazine for all ages. Anyway, that's the end of hooting art for this week. I will be back next week. But if you've been keeping an eye on the hooting yard website, shooting yard.org you will know that I came upon a trove of old old stuff like pamphlet on pamphlets, etc, from the last century. And so, I've been reprinting some of that stuff for archival purposes, because very few people actually own the original pamphlet. And yes, so I'll be I'll be reading some of that in the in the weeks to come. And I have big plans to devote a couple of shows, two, possibly three or four shows to one of the rarest hooting yd texts in existence. But you will have to wait for that. So that's all from me for this week. Thank you very much to Sarah for engineering it because john went off to galavanting although he's now Well again, which is good. So well he galavanting. Anyway, Sara produced today's show. Thanks, and I'll be back next week. Bye.
