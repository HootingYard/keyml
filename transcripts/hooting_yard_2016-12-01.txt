Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. It's hard to believe that it's almost exactly 10 years since Hazel Blears says the days of pulling the central lever are behind us. listeners of a certain age will remember the leavers there was a row of them color coded black and pink and orange and Cerise and yellow and golden and Dan and red and lavender and green and Motovun coffee and blue and wheat and white. They had to be pulled in a precise order of course, which changed from hour to hour. It was not well paid work being a lever pulling person, but it was dignified and responsible and important work and those who pulled the levers were accorded due respect. And none gained as much respect as the puller of the central lever. The only one which changed color, or rather, was wrapped in burlap sheath to different colors, hour by hour, and sometimes minute by minute by identifier scheme so abstruse so utterly bewildering, that those responsible for it rarely lasted more than a couple of months in the job before they had to be retired off to a seaside resort. pebble heads best selling paper back, they selected the burlap sheath for the central lever. True Stories of her Robic color coding is a useful if failed attempt to demystify the whole shenanigans in words of one syllable. It is sometimes hard to comprehend just how important the leavers were. Nowadays were able to live happy and fulfilling lives without them. Without the relentless pulling of them, or salad seems. I have my doubts. It's not man, the astrologer that makes me hanker for the days when the pulling of the leavers, and particularly the pulling of the central lever was uppermost in people's mind, drawing us together, binding us, giving a sense of common purpose. Blodgett always remembered his time as the puller of the central lever as the happiest period of his life. His enemies said still say that he only did the job for the free toffee apples, and normally one would agree. I've had stern words to say about blood jetty and gluttony myself, but for once I think his motives were pure. After an apprenticeship on the golden and pink leavers, he stepped up to the central lever pulling position on some gertrudes day in 1952. A man who saw it will ever forget the beam of fantastic glory on his pockmarked and greasy face, as he stood there on his plinth, as the duty cadet, swapped blue for a slightly different shade of blue dyed burlap trees on the central lever. The flock of trained nightingales on the railings burst into joy, a song, fiery stars flamed in the sky. Blodgett waited for the part of a Cournot, which would be his signal to pull the central lever for the first time. Just thinking about it makes me want to weep. So please forgive my smart feelings, as I forgive those who snuffled before me. Who would have thought that Blodgett would be the last person ever to pull a central lever. He did so for many, many years, of course, with gusto and vim to the applause of those who were very occasionally allowed past the railings to watch. But came the day that the pulling of the leavers, the black and pink and orange and Cerise and yellow and golden and Dan and red and lavender and green and Mo, and coffee and blue and wheat and white ones, as well as the central lever became somehow irrelevant to our town mocked, even seen as an antiquated and idiotic ritual. Blodgett and the others were paid off with a crate of toffee apples given three cabins in the hills, and the leavers rusted, the burlap sheets were left to rot. The nightingale trainer was taken to a quarry and shocked by the new regime. And one day, gigantic bellowing engines came and flattened the square where the leavers and the railings that stood for 100 years, and it was all gone.

There are some people who will remember the central lever, but there is no one left alive who witnessed the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin Bob's, nor do we have any written record of that time. The pitiful smidgen of information we do have has come down to us in the form of incomprehensible pictograms, and a pair of 78 RPM shellacked discs. And these are locked away in a concrete bunker, far far underground, beneath the Museum at or near ACC. The bunker is only accessible through heavily padlocked Orrin Hatch, one of the very few such hatches ever manufactured, based upon a patented hatch design, which, despite what you may have read in the sorts of magazines, beloved of the conspiracy fixated, has absolutely no connection with us senator orrin hatch, Republican Utah those of you with even a smattering of knowledge about hatches and bunkers will understand how hard it is to get anywhere near those pictograms. Those 78. When last one of our investigators examine the hat, she reported back that it showed no signs of having been opened since the notorious blockman incident of 1956. The reckless idiocy of blackmun's intervention has been thoroughly dissected in pebble heads best selling paper back a man and his shovels so I need not rehearse it here. Our investigator codename hortensia reported something else. She said that the metal ladder which forms the final stage of the approach to the bunker was rife with scratches and dents, buckled in a few places. This is new, the ladder has until now been kept in pristine condition by the maintenance team at or near act, whose rigorous training is well attested. hortensia was unable to posit a convincing explanation for the ladder damage. And for the time being the file has been put aside. When I say aside, I mean literally that placed on the right hand side of my desk next to the pot with the bond side punkten and the framed photograph of being Crosby embracing a howler monkey. Had I classed it as an active file, it would be in the wire tray on the left hand side alongside my important stationary buzzer message funnel and metal Tapping Machine. The area of the desk immediately in front of me is cat bear, so I can think clearly. I know this sounds as if I've fallen victim to the fad for Feng Shui, but that's not the case. In fact, I am minded to say that Mr. Crosby's howler monkey would benefit more from feng shui than I would. Incidentally, you may have been told by some earnest network that the correct pronunciation of feng shui is fun. Why not so it is actually found the shoe or possibly finger shot of what I was thinking clearly about at the moment was not hortensis report on the damaged metal ladder, but a more urgent matter. That very morning, the post he had brought me a package Excuse me that very morning the poster you had brought me a package containing a miniature shellacked disc. Wrapped in greaseproof paper. There was also a letter obviously written by a mad person, claiming that the disc was a copy of one of the two discs locked in the bunker. And if I listened to it with care, I would learn many many interesting things about the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin Bob. Now you must understand that in all my years of service to the commission, I have never heard even a whisper such a copy existed. My first impulse was to smash the shack into smithereens for I have a short fuse. And I'm not to be dallied with bipolar croons. Why is a council with provided by a 10th, who offered to listen to the tiny 78 on her Mickey phone and to appraise it to content with an unorthodox yet piercing intellect.

Frank Key  11:07
I gave her the Go ahead, and as I so often do, sat contemplating the blue eyes have been Crosby and the black eyes of the howler monkey pondering on the ineffable mysteries of existence. I was snapped out of my reverie when hortensia came dashing breathlessly into my sanctum, her face twisted into a Richter's of lovecraftian terror. Throughout my life, I have been plagued by nosebleed and the one that began to flow the instant or tense crashed in was the big potato, as they say. I was far too busy flapping around trying to find a cloth to staunch the gold pouring out of my nose to listen to my investigators gibbering by the time I'd recovered myself, or tense wound, and in so doing, she banged her head, causing, as we've later discovered complete memory loss. She never did remember what she heard on that shellback disk, or nor was she able to recall which railway station she had rented a luggage locker in which to put the disk for safekeeping. I remonstrated with her Of course, but with a faint heart. For despite my ferocious temper. I'm a complete softie in the presence of amnesiacs. So now I sit at my desk, looking into the eyes of the crooner, and the Howler and hortensia reclines on a sofa somewhere far away, having her brain massaged by nuns. The truth is, she was the only investigator I had all the others having been taken away from me by the brother in fact, heads upstairs and now hortensis gone on hortensis memories gone. And I wonder if the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin Bob's is also gone. irretrievably vanishing into the past, it's splendors never to be rekindled in the minds of men and women in this baffling age of pap.

The following recipe is an effective remedy for a common malady. All you have to do is to use your skills, judgment and pulsating brain flashes to work out what the malady is. So here is the recipe for the effective remedy. one pint of new grool one gram of tincture of green acorns, half a gram of hypo, one 16th of a gram of castor sugar, three clove kernels, half a pound of coffee essence, three quarters of a pound of sugar of zinc, two grams of by sulfate of LED one pint of spirits of sulfur, five grams of bicarbonate of salt Peter, and one ounce of table salt. I recommend making up a big pot of the lovely guru and the guru and using it to try to a variety of record and while inducing medical conditions. I'll tell you the answer to which malady specifically remedies next week.

Dobson lived in the era before mobile phones, of course. So when he found himself in peril in an isolated spot, he had to harness every last scrap of ingenuity to summon help. You were I would simply make a call on our mobile. Well, you would, but I wouldn't, because I do not own a mobile phone and never shall fall. They are an abomination unto me. But this was not an option for Dobson. So what did he do? Let's take a closer look at the circumstances. It was it Tuesday in February, football fans were grieving the loss of the Busby Babes in the Munich air disaster, Pope Pius the 12th and declared that St. Claire was to be the patron saint of television, and little blind David Blunkett was just 11 years old. Meanwhile, Dobson got lost on ill advised hiking expedition and found himself exhausted in a spinny menaced by feral goats. The out of print pamphleteer had also managed to get himself hopelessly entangled in the thicket of thorny, rambley creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles. That's the kind of spinny it was at least 20 miles from the nearest village, and we no path no country lanes, leaving anywhere close to it. There was it it's true, a big pylon a couple of dozen yards away, but it was alone pile and unconnected to any kind of electrical grid or other wiring system, a pylon, the purpose of which was unknown, and it was a pylon of rust suggestive of abandonment and diffuse. This was not the first time Dobson had been in a hiking pickle, and it would not be the last. Indeed late in life. He had enough material to furnish a pamphlet entitled an anthology of disastrous hiking mishaps cobbled together from a lifetime of ill starred rustic pursuit out of print. What was significant about this particular pickle was the manner in which Dobson succeeded and extricating himself from it. This was the period during which he had joined an experimental knitting circle. And as luck would have it, he had in his body bag that day, his latest project, it was an interpretation in wool of the wreck of the Deutschland by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Dobson realized that when fully unraveled, the yarn would stretch for miles. He sat down in the brambles lit his pipe, took the scrunched up woolen masterpiece out of his body bag, and unrivaled unrivaled, unrivaled. Two hours later, he was still unraveling. The sun was setting by the time he was done, but Dobson had no fear of the night for he was sanguine. frequently asked question, why didn't the pamphleteer uses portable metal Tapping Machine to call for help? Answer, he was unable to use his portable metal Tapping Machine because there was no ground level pneumatic hub within reach. The wall fully unraveled Dobson tapped out his pipe on a stone and back into one of the feral toggenburg the goats were still gathered in a gang on the edge of the spinny and it's a mystery why they had not attacked the Bramble trap pamphleteer. In the anthology. Dobson suggested that a combination of accurate pipe smoke unraveled wall and his sanguine nature had deterred the goats. But it seems that for once he was being modest. Almost certainly, the decisive factor was Dobson's eerie ability to mesmerize goats, especially toggenburg. It is a skill which has not been much remarked upon, possibly because Dobson himself made light of it, and Curiously, never devoted a pamphlet to it. But he had been practicing goat mesmerize ation since he was a baby in arms. And now he's expertise paid off, beckoning. toggenburg as I said, Dobson tied one end of the length of wall around one of its satanic horns, then whispered goat language into its ear. We do not know what he said, but presumably it was something like scamper away goat in a straight line, and do not stop until you reach a populated village.

Frank Key  20:56
It was not a village that the goat scampered to, however, three hours after being entranced it came to a wire fence, chewed its way through, and in so doing set over hideous caterwauling alarm system. The night was filled with noise, and the toggenburg was caught in the white glare of a Clyde light. Within seconds, it was surrounded by a clumping troupe of visored commandos armed with Simon and Garfunkel rifles. inadvertently, the mesmerized Capricorn had stumbled into a top secret military intelligence compound. A commando with a captain's badge bundled the goat onto a book site cradled chained to a winch, while a second Commando. This one with a cadet badge untied the wall from it torn miles away. Dobson was smoking his pipe and lackadaisically paying out the wall hand over hand. Suddenly, he felt a jerk and held on tight, and then he was yanked free of the thorny, rambley creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles and dragged across a wasteland of fields and gravel pits and swamps and countryside filth until he fetched up at the feet of the commandos who really mean just as Midnight's truck. valleys how Dobson got out of a hiking pickle, only to find himself in a very alarming dilemma indeed, slap bang in the middle of a military intelligence compound. That was top secret for very good reasons. reasons which, even at the distance of 50 years, I'm far too terrified to dive out. He was placed in a holding cell with the feral goat and interrogated at length. The Wall was returned to him, and they asked for and was given a pair of knitting needles. Between interrogations, he was able to reenact the wreck of the Deutschland. Although much of his woolen reimagining of the lines about the tall man was gnawed into scritti by the toggenburg. By the time the commandos released the pamphlet here, having scrambled his brain pan so thoroughly that he remembered nothing after the spinny Richard Milhouse Nixon had published his book six crises, Pluto and Neptune were in alignment for the first time in 403 years, and little blind. David Blunkett was no longer so little. Dobson returned home even more sanguine than before the hiking pickle. As for the feral goat, it stayed with the commandos. They adopted this as a pet and called it Flopsy.

a modicum of sense from the pubescent noodle head to run the television schedules. I wonder if their ranks have been infiltrated by a Dobson list. Apparently, there is a forthcoming TV series called strictly pamphleteering, in which contestants will write pamphlets and declaim them on live television. week by week, the panel of judges and the public will out the most hopeless would be pamphleteer. Until the end of the series. The winner is crowned strictly pamphleteering pamphleteer of the year. Now, details have yet emerged of who will be on the judging panel. Though names such as Dale Winton, Yoko Ono, vs Naipaul and Leo Sayer have been touted. The panel will also decide on each week pamphlet topic, with subject ranging from Ospreys to goat husbandry to the astronomical innovations of Tyco Bri, we can be sure that the eventual winner will have shown a splendid ability to declaim a mighty pamphleteering pros about pretty much anything under the sun. Could the show bring us a 21st century Dobson? I live in hope.

I'd like to bring you a quotation from Simona, my nimi and Simona My name is or was the Los Angeles Zoo feng shui consultant. And she said once we don't have any books on feng shui from monkeys.

minutes to go, but I'm not actually feeling very well. I battled through last week, when I wasn't here. I was in Amsterdam. And I had a nice time in Amsterdam, except that I wasn't feeling very well, for part of the time there. And in fact, I spent an entire day in the bed in in my hotel, which is not the really the best way to spend time in Amsterdam. And it was it wasn't it wasn't good bed time. Like with john and Yoko in Toronto. It was bad beer. I was lying there. whimpering actually, I think john and Yoko mala spent time in a bed in Amsterdam as well. Anyone know? I think they did. I think anyway, I spent time I had a bed in in Amsterdam, but it was not a good bedding. It was a bad bedding. And

But now I am Anyway, I'm not going back drives around next week. I'll be here. So all else being equal. I'll read the stuff and I'll also tell you about that group recipe and what it's a cure for. And yeah, that's really about it for this week, I'm afraid do go to the hooting od website. And you can read lots of stuff and look at pictures and buy books and all sorts of things or you could just send me some money for Christmas. That would be nice. Bye bye.
