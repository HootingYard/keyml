Good evening, my name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. Imagine the scene on Christmas morning. little clip off guard, wakes up in her attic bedroom in her iron cot and wonders what's in the stocking hanging on the end. She's hoping for a piece of citrus fruit perhaps and a toy hydroelectric power station. She rummages in the stocking and pulls out a single package. That's all Where is she scrambles it open with her bitten fingernails and immediately begins weeping with joy.

That was an advert obviously, so we'd better start the show again. This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. I'm Frankie This is hooting out on the air. As an advanced stage, the gunk is scraped off with a tallow knife collected in a pot reduced by steaming and fed to see horses. After several days to see horses begin to display intricate and abnormal behavior patterns. These patterns can be traced on graph paper with propelling pencils and a ruler. Comparison with earlier graphs down under a double blind tests have proved immensely illuminating. So illuminating, so lustrous indeed, that copied out onto onion skin paper and crumpled up they can be inserted into glass bulbs and lighter long corridor in a large building for upwards of four days. By the fourth day, they are dimming there is a dying of the light and sensitive persons mourn as mourn they might. Having disposed of the gunk as described, the main bulk is fed through a sieve. The most effective safe to use is one with so called Sweden bourgie and Angel holes. These are not generally available at the shops, but can be ordered direct by post from the manufacturers, thus keeping costs surprisingly low. You might want to purchase two or three at one time. The fragile nature of the Save means that it will not alas survive much use is easily distressed, especially when you try to force stuff through the holes as certain boisterous and reckless persons tend to do. If you have such a person on your team, it's a good idea to keep them away from the sibs by telling them to go and keep an eye on the seahorses. Other pesky or exasperating team members can be usefully employed and kept out of your hair by laying the plumb line. This should consist of this should consist of tent pegs and butcher string and stretch as far as the eye can see. The line should ideally be at the height of an average hollyhock. The calculation being made can by consulting the tables at the back of the annual hollyhock height register. A copy of this ought to be in your local reference library, but will usually not be available for borrowing. So illiterate and some and numerous member of the team with a valid library ticket should be delegated to copy out the required data dials that can use the back of the graph paper on which the behavior patterns of the seahorses have earlier been inscribed in majestic sweeping lines and arcs of unsurpassed beauty. Meanwhile, having said the main bulk through the sieve into a bucket, the bucket can now be ferried to the platform. They should stand on sturdy props, the sturdy the better. Do not on any account, use balsa wood. You're probably familiar with the case of Tarleton and what transpired with his balsa wood props. If necessary, test the sturdiness using the standard tests of sturdiness which appear as appendix seven in your pamphlet. Otherwise, proceed directly to the siphon and funnel pallava. siphon this stuff out of the bucket working slowly and methodically and seamlessly. as it passes through the funnel. take snapshots at one minute intervals from the designated angles. These not need these need not be full color snapshots unless they have been explicitly explicitly specified in the contract. That's certainly an unusual clause nowadays. And if it does appear, it's worth checking. The contract might after all have been drawn up by a half wit. Try to ensure that no seahorses are visible in the background of the snapshots. The whole lot safer. The scraped off gunk should now have been transferred into beakers without spillage. Align the beakers along the plumb line. Once they're in place, and only when they're in place. Attach the snap on snap off lids. Using a thick bold black indelible marker pen. Draw identifying symbols on the lids. For examples of apt symbols, see appendix nine.

Make sure each one is different. There is often a temptation to repeat the seahorse symbol because it's so factoring. Fight against this temptation with all your might like Christ in the wilderness. In case of rainfall, it will be necessary to cover both beakers and plumb line with tarpaulins. The approved color is almost transparent, light blue, any other color is likely to result in fewer points being awarded without the right of appeal. Again, the case of towels and should give you pause. If you're thinking of using black or yellow tarpaulin, or God forbid a particularly opaque one. It was not amusing when Tarleton had to account for himself before the panel. The seahorses tiny brains will by now be utterly ravaged, scooped them from the tank with a standard anglers net and deposit them on the slab one by one using a very sharp kitchen knife. Remove the brain from each seahorse. If you feel pangs of pity in your soul, you're pursuing the wrong hobby, and would be better off taking up ping pong. Place the brains in a brown paper bag, twist the top of the bag to seal it and then swing it around your head several times while usually lighting and incantation. It is important to note that this step is essentially meaningless. So you need not put a great deal of effort into it. But it's always a good idea to show willing, you do not know who is watching. holding the bag in your right hand walk the length of the plumb line. pausing at each speaker added paws gaze mournfully into the middle distance, your lips trembling, some of the feathers in your head dress may fall to the ground, you should disregard them, while at the same time being very careful not to tread on them as you resume your walk towards the next speaker along the line. That is unless they're Sparrow feathers, in which case you should pick them up and put them in your pocket. But that of course should go without saying as it is blindingly obvious. If you have read this far. That was an extract from the book of significant tomfoolery. By the master

Writers of science fiction are fond of the invisible force field, an unseen barrier which unexpectedly stops a Spaceman or the evil fargen in his tracks. Landscape gardeners of the 18th century had much the same idea with the invention of the haha this is a sunken wall, it's topped at ground level and bounded on the other side by a ditch from even a short distance then it cannot be seen and the sweeping view of the gorgeous grounds is uninterrupted. It is an invisible force field. Haha would seem to be a variant of the original fringe, ah, in which form It first appeared in English. Clearly, it expresses the element of surprise, no different for the 18th century person strolling in the gardens of a stately home than for the Spaceman or the evil far gone, battering up against an invisible force field in a distant galaxy in the 46th century. One such stroller on an 18th century afternoon with Ned slop, a factotum in the service of Baron Plunkett of Plunkett Hall. SWAT swap had been instructed to prune a filbert hedge and was making his way towards it. Armed with a pair of shears when his course took him for a time along one side of the haha as a factotum have some at winters slop new every inch of Plunkett Hall and it's magnificent Parkland, it's har halls and filbert hedges. So as he reached the Haha, he had no grounds to be surprised. Nonetheless, on this particular afternoon, he didn't. He did indeed cry. Ah, upon arriving at the Ha ha, I think dropped his shares and hurried at once back to Plunkett Hall. True hurry was not within slops gift, however, for he was an ancient and creaking factotum whose movements were akin to those of a beckettian cramp. Indeed, it was almost dusk before he staggered into the library, where he found Baron Plunkett. The Baron was a scholarly Baron, and on this 18th century dusk he had his head buried in a huge leather bound copy of palm Toppy Dan's explanations. He looked up as slots to panting in the doorway. What is it slop? Other filbert hedges Julie pruned, said the Baron. pant pant pant, panted slop not yet, sir. If it please your baronial magnificence for before I was able to prune the filbert hedges I came upon something untoward that the haha prey be more explicit. Good slop, said the Baron. I don't rightly know how to describe it, sir. except to say there was a bit of a brouhaha. It is not the first time there has been a brouhaha. The Haha, said the Baron. I expect it is merely an intoxicated peasant, or toppled poacher now pray leave me to my pontoppidan this neither peasant nor poacher so far as I can describe, said slop. I know full well the sorts of brouhaha as they cause what were their intoxication and illegal rabbits and so forth. No, sir. This is a brouhaha of quite another kidney. And one I feel duty bound as a loyal factotum of some 80 winters to report to you that you may take whatever steps you deem necessary to address it. Baron Plunkett sighed and put down his pontoppidan on a side table and he used himself to his gout ridden feet. Very well swap fetch my stick, would you And so, in the den dusk, the Baron and his factotum went to hobbling on. creaking across the majestic lawns towards the haha. Christ's wounds, cried the Baron, when eventually they reached the spot. This is more than a mere brouhaha flop. This is an inexplicable calamity. You did well to alert me to it.

Frank Key  15:21
For before their eyes, the haha was littered with the dead distorted bodies of several peasants and poachers and widow women. He twisted beyond recognition and horribly descend granulated. So inexplicably a calamity, continued the Baron that I dare say not even my revered pontoppidan could explain it in his explanations. or, excuse me. choke slop, all tie high back to the library to effect your Toma, Sir, he said. No, no good slop that will not be necessary for cast your eyes to the and Baron Plunkett pointed to the ground some yards away to the left were from the haha a trail of noise some green translucent found bubbling slime stretched across the lawns towards the fill but hedges. Let us follow the trail slop, said the Baron, and we shall discover who or what has wrought such hideous horror and descend rank elation. But but but but will we not suffer the same fate as the peasants and poachers and widow women vast sprawl dead in the Haha, wild slop? Fear not, slop said the barren I am a barren and a gentleman, and I am armed with a stick. No one dust tangle with me to do so would be socially unthinkable in this our 18th century. So the Baron and his factotum followed the trail, and that is how they came face to face with the evil Sargon, whose time travelling voyage had suddenly and unexpectedly come clunk to a halt. The space creature had hit an invisible force field in the shape of the Plunkett Hall haha. As Ned slop coward and pedaled in his pants, the barons strode forward and waved his stick at the vile shapeless jelly like pulsating green and yellow and most monocular repellent many antennas squelchy throbbing sucking and seizing blob that was the evil thug on Get off my land at once. cried the Baron, and he whacked the space monster with his stick, whereupon it dissolved in a disgusting Belkin vapor. Come slop, let's return to the hall. I shall read further in pontoppidan. And you may spend the rest of the evening scrubbing books and doing other tasks appropriate to your lowly station. And far, far away, distant in both time and space, the populations of several planetoids rejoiced the defeat of the evil.

What kind of madness is it that would prompt a person to make up a duck? This was the question I asked myself after consulting a list of fictional ducks and discovering with something akin to terror that it contained over 150 non existent ducks. Let us allow those words to penetrate over 150 non existent ducks. That's no small number. line them all up in a row and it would take a while to walk from one end to the other. And imagine the den if they all cracked at the same time. You'd have to stuff your ears with cotton wall. But of course, they cannot be lined up and they cannot crack because they do not exist and never have existed. They are wholly imaginary semi aquatic beings born in the minds of flawed humanity. It is not that the world lacks real flesh and feather and blood ducks. Go to any duck pond or lake and the chances are, you will see more than a few ducks. You might even toss some scraps of stale bread from a brown paper bag. If you're that way inclined, you might appear at distant duck through a pair of binoculars. But it's a far cry from that jennison pursuit to unleash from within the throbbing jelly of your brain a made up duck. Yet clearly, that's what's happened in the past, with a number of people, though fewer than 150. Tragically, some among these poor duck haunted souls have invented more than one fictional duck. You'd think, wouldn't you that having made up a non existent duck, the duck maker would mock their brow and retire from the fray, perhaps clear their head by going on a long hiking holiday in an area of few ponds and fewer lakes. The last thing you would expect is that they would immediately set about inventing another duck. But some have done just that. Now you see why I use the word madness. Our difficulty lies in trying to grasp the lineaments of a mentality that can spark the thought. There are millions of ducks in the world, but and so I'm going to make up another one. And not only to have a thought but to act upon it. Perhaps that's the crucial distinction between mere eccentricity and full blown madness. Casting back up on my own mental history, I wonder if it's ever occurred to me to make up a duck. I wonder too, if that's a rather common thought, one shared by thousands if not millions of persons past and present. Yet how few of us have taken the fateful next step, the actual invention of a non existent duck. There's something of the Frankenstein about it, isn't there. derangement, delusion and mania all focused horribly on an ID a fix, but the duck makers have no need of lightning blasted laboratories high end castles, nor have hunchbacked assistance named mango, nor have the various paraphernalia ascribed to Victor Frankenstein in this or that recounting of his blasphemous doings. To make up a duck, one may need merely a pencil or a typewriter, or some cloth the company by basic skills in needle work. That being so we must not lose sight of the fact that the same mad impulses at work in both the crazed scientist and the creator of fictional ducks. It's an impulse to tame or control nature to play God. This is nowhere more evident than in the unnerving fact that the majority of fictional ducks are blessed or damned with the gift of human speech. And just as I'm quite clear in my use of the word madness, so too, with nerving I suspect if you were ever to come upon a real duck that instead of cracking spoke to you in a familiar tongue, you would be unnerved. I dreamed of such a duck once, and I woke up screaming. It was a hideous nightmare rather than a dream. But the important thing to state here is that the talking duck was the sole source of my terror. Nothing else that occurred in the nightmare was frightening or gruesome, or I'm wholly the same was unremarkable, even humdrum. I was in my childhood home. The house I grew up in.

Frank Key  24:15
My parents were there peripherally, in that there was a sense of their presence. I entered the living room and sat in an armchair and looked across and they're perched on the seat of the matching armchair was a duck. It engaged me in conversation. At first I felt no sense of alarm. Dream logic was at work and all seemed well. But as the duck continued to speak, its voice grew more grating and menacing. And it spoke of things I shudder to recall slowly dawned on me that it was an evil duck, and Lucifer or Beelzebub, duck, fathomless an awful in its pure an unalloyed malevolence. That's when I woke up screaming It's a nightmare I've never been able to forget. That duck remains for me the epitome of all fictional ducks. And it's why I cannot shake the feeling that every other non existent duck aspires to its state of sheer evil. We're the makers of made up ducks took heed. What I haven't mentioned in the foregoing, is the second category of fictional ducks. One's far more numerous than the 150 or so given in the list. These are decoyed ducks usually carved from wood, Pinocchio ducks, if you will. They are even more terrifying than the non existent ducks we've already considered. But my nerves are shattered now, and I cannot bring myself to write about them until I've eased my overheated brain. But give me time, and I shall summon up the mental and moral resources to address the subject. And to explain why, whenever you encounter a decoyed duck, you should be very, very afraid.

Those three pieces I read to you were all taken from the funny mountain, which is the new paperback, which you heard the advert for the beginning of the show is available from Lulu press. Go to the hooting yard website, you will see a picture of the cover designed by Ruthie Bosh, and if you click on that, it'll tell you where to go to go and order your copy. I do recommend that you do this quickly so you can get your copy in time for Christmas. It's a fine book. And while I would say that, wouldn't I but anyway, I think you'll enjoy it. I see ice hooting yard paperback, the funny mountain, so buy that and that's the end of the show for this week is the penultimate hooting yard on the air of 2014. I'll be back next week for the final hooting yard of 2014. And I'll have more blather to Bulava. Bye bye
