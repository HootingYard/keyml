Hello, people, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. Live from London and this is hooting out on the air with me, Frank key. And about five years ago, five and a half years ago, a story appeared on the hooting yard website and probably was read on the radio around the same time. Which I'm going to read again today because what happened was that over the years, literally a handful of people have asked for a sequel, and I have at last written a sequel, The sequel will come later in the show, but to begin with, here is the story from about five years ago. Will you come with me to Bell shadows feast? asked agneta I didn't know you'd been invited. I'll have to ask Bjorn said Benny. Benny strode off into the mountains to find Bjorn agneta stayed at the hotel, sipping her alcohol free absence. Wild winds were howling and storm clouds gathered. Benny found Beaune sheltering in a declivity he was burning charcoal. agneta wants me to go with her to Belle shows as feast, said Benny, after tipping his hat to be worn in greeting. What do you think? The gods may throw a dice said be on their mind as cold as ice. He stared off into the mist and shrouded distance towards the fireworks factory and the abandoned tennis courts. I shall reflect on what you have said and come to a decision then said Benny, thank you. On the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on the mountain path by Annie Fred. She was dressed like a Gaucho and looked as if he had been weeping. Any fruit, whatever is the matter. Ask Benny. Any fruit dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel, her upper lip curled in a sneer, discomforted by her silence, Benny began to gamble. agneta asked me to accompany her to Bell shows as feast, he said and I asked Bjorn for his advice. He's up there in a declivity burning charcoal. man a man a tech owl. you fasten said any fried and she promised a way into the midst.

So as promised, the exciting sequel for that story will be later in the show. But for now, it's been a while since we paid a visit to the groov lab high in the Swiss Alps, where tireless boffins attempt to isolate the essential core of hooting yards grooviness, but we may have to pack our Pipi bags and hike over there again. For it appears that objections have been raised to the very practice of grooving itself. Our dulcet voiced South African correspondent letter my Bulu has found herself leaping to the defense of all things groovy by asking in the form of song, the cogent question. What is wrong with grooving? Actually, mizmor Bulu asked what is wrong with grooving, but I fear will not encourage the use of a pocket patient. Otherwise, we start getting into hootin yard territory, at which point civilization begins to crumble. I pause here briefly to note that mizmor Bulu His name is an anagram of oma loud belt, which is as we know the name given to a far far distant string of glittering stars and planets somewhere in this or another galaxy. dubbed as such by a fearsome Teutonic astronomer, greater beard and brain alike. His own name Alas, I cannot quite recall. It's not even on the tip of my tongue. It's as if it's been utterly expunged from my memory, possibly by a bash on the bonds received when negotiating an out in Germany on my way to Switzerland, there to visit the groove lab boffins. I had my puppy bag and my hiking apparel, and I had a handful of feed for any goats that might cross my path as I went did my way. The sky was blue and I sort of rock skin. Well, in truth, I thought of both Ruskin and let him a Bulu. I wondered as I often have, if Ruskin would have got down with the hooting yard groove having been born in a different era. We tend not to associate Ruskin with grooviness of any kidney. But that's a mistake. I think it's not escaped my notice that his very name suggests a Bulu esque apoc a patient What is wrong with Ruskin? Indeed. Had I had my portable metal Tapping Machine upon my person upon that out, I may well have prank the message to mizmor Bulu, insisting that she make a new recording of her song substituting Ruskin for grooving not that this would have gone down to well with the boffins in the groove lab, who I know consider mizmor Bulu their staunch champion and her song their anthem. When you're working day consists of exhausting hours of experimental groovy research. It must be a terrific dampener to learn that sama calling into question the practice of grooviness itself, its tenets and ethics and its drip cut. I was keen to speak with the boffins to see how they were bearing up to spread some Pep, though I'm often of lagu breus mean, I'm not averse to dispersing Pep where and when I can, particularly among boffins confined to their fastness in the Swiss Alps. I had gifts for them to stuffed into my puppy bag, with samizdat copies of some of the more inspiring letters from Ruskin's falls clever Gera. So there I was, toiling up on Alpine slope on the lookout for goats thinking about roschin and let them abou and nary a thought in my head regarding the baby, brainy tonic astronomer, who would name the homeland belt. Perhaps Had it been night rather than day had the broad sweep of the heavenly firmament glittered in darkness above me, rather than the bronze and battering some, I might have thought about stars and planets and astronomers old and new, to tonic and otherwise. And that name I cannot now remember would have come to me around it. I could have framed that piece of Anak dotage to beguile the boffins over lunchtime sandwiches in their canteen, chalet. I would draw together their singing heroine let them a Bulu with the stars in a distant galaxy, somehow working Mr. Ruskin and then la flip for my tippy bag, the copies of fours clever jera to boost their pet. Alas, it was not to be.

As I have indicated, I was well prepared Should I meet with any goats who crossed my path. I had handfuls of goat feed, chiefly nettles and genetically modified Sal Tamas and bran flakes with which to assuage them. What had not occurred to me was that being Alpine goats, they would be clumping about above the path, and in a frisky moment, dislodge a rock or two, which rolling unstoppably down the slope, would you land upon my bonds and knock me out? It was night when I came to, above me the mighty firmament the stars in their courses glittering against a cloudless black expands out there somewhere, possibly visible if I have a powerful telescope was the omelette belt. What was it Dobson had written. Of all the belts in all the galaxies, the cloud belt can lay claim to being the grooviest belt imaginable. I wonder if the boffins in the groove lab knew that try as I might, I could not remember the name of that long dead to tonic astronomer. I got to my feet. strewn on the path, I saw the untouched goat feed. alongside it, my open Pipi bag, and the few remaining shreds of my copies of Ruskin's fours clever Jarrah chewed up and munched by the Alpine goats, which, like the rocks that had been designed to me had descended from the slopes. The goats were gone now and my boffin gift was gone, too. I could hardly present them with the sorry tatters which In any case, a mounting wind would soon disperse into the night to arrive at the groove lab without a gift to pet. The boffins would be unforgivably on groovy. Sadly, I turned around and began the long hike back to my homeland. I was in no mood for grooving paps. I never would be ever again.

Frank Key  13:09
so there you had let them were Bulu singing What is wrong with Ruskin? Sorry, what is wrong with grooving and followed by the hooting yard chant. That was a version of the chant for two voices. Ideally, it should be chanted by a cast of thousands from a topper, Hill, or a mountain. If you would like to take part in the project to gather that thousand people together to translate the 15 second hooting out count, please let me know. It's quite extraordinary, but I had no idea when I posted a while ago, on the hooting yard website the first in a projected series of photographs of notable authors sitting on swans, Raymond Roussel that it would prove to be the most popular item to appear anywhere on the internet ever. According to the statistics turned out by my bots manometer attached to the computer via pneumatic funnel, that one blog postage has been viewed by billions of people in every nation on Earth, as well as by further billions of beings on far flung planetoids these obviously which have interweb connection infrastructure in place. Clearly, there's something about a notable authors sitting on a swan, which speaks to people with deepest yearnings. The picture is more popular Even then, other such internet hitters are video of a cat behaving foolishly an amateur diva belting out a song glut, or the ebook download of the anatomy of melancholy. And now, my postbox every day is crammed full of photographs, many quite brazenly counterfeit of other authors sitting on other swans. Many of these seem to have been sent by the writers themselves, keen to jump on the bandwagon. Note to Jeanette Winterson, please desist In any case, by the look of it. That's not a real swan. Others are crude Photoshop fabrications showing I presume the sender's favorite writer superimposed on a swan. I must admit, I never realized just how many fans as Byatt has. So what I've done is I've taken on a team of otherwise unemployable ragamuffins to sift through the mountain of pictures, and to pick out the ones that appear genuine. Also, I've drummed into this scruffy little head that the series title is notable authors sitting on swans to make sure they discard the Zadie Smith and Adam thermowells of this benighted world. And it goes without saying that I'm doing my utmost to track down a photograph of the 20th century's Titanic pamphleteer Dobson sitting on a swan. I'm not holding out much hope, though, for Dobson was notoriously camera shy. Indeed, he usually attacked with a hammer anybody trying to take a snap of him with their box camera. He was that kind of pamphleteer.

Here is a passage from an 1817 book by Sir Richard Phillips, in titled A morning's walk from London to Q.

Frank Key  16:59
In considering this subject with the attention that is Drew to it, it does appear to me that all the stories of ghosts and super or unnatural appearances may be referred to some of the following causes. One, to the augmentation produced by fear in any effect on the senses. Thus, the air of a terrified man will convert the smallest noise into the report of thunder or his I will change the stump of a tree into a monster 20 feet high. As the center's are furnished for their protection, their irritability under the impression of fear is part of their economy as the means of preserving our being. But it is absurd to refer back the effect thus augmented to external causes, which might be capable of producing the augmentation. to such an error of the senses and of reasoning is, however, to be referred half the ghosts and supernaturals of which we hear in village ale houses in nurseries and schools. To to diseased organs of sensation. As an inflamed I producing the effect of flashes of light in the dark, or fullness of blood producing a ringing or singing in the ears. Sometimes, diseases of the visual organs are accompanied by hallucinations of mind, and persons ill in fevers often see successions of figures and object flicked before their eyes tell where disease has been removed. The workings of conscience or nervous affections will also produce diseases of the senses, and such hallucinations of mind as to occasion a person to fancy he sees another or to be haunted by him. But there is nothing supernatural in always, it is sometimes a local disease, sometimes an effect of fever, sometimes and nervous affection, and sometimes partial insanity. Three to natural causes not understood by the parties, thus anciently the northern lights were mistaken for armies fighting meteors and comets for flaming swords, portending destruction or pestilence, the electrified points of swords, to the favor of heaven, the motions of the planets to attractive effluvia and all the effects of the coal mixture of the gases to benign or diabolical agency as they happen to produce on the parties good or evil. So, in the like manner, old houses are generally said to be haunted, owing to the noises which arise from the cracking and yielding of their walls and timbers and from the protection and easy passage, which in the course of time, they afford to rat mice, weasels, etc, who's actually tivity in the nighttime affords the foundation of numerous apprehensions and fancies of the credulous for, to spontaneous combustions, or destinations, which produce occasional lights and noises or under unchanged circumstances, recurring lights and noises, chiefly claiming attention in the night. Thus, houses shut up and on Ed are wrapped from the petrification of animal and vegetable matter to generate hydrogen gas. The Accidental combustion of which by contact with phosphoric matter, naturally generated in the same situation will produce those effects of lights and noises heard in empty houses. So churchyards churches in which the dead are buried cemeteries and ruins of old buildings must frequently give out large quantities of these gases. And consequently, from exactly similar causes, they are likely to produce the very effect which we witness in the willow the Wisp or in hydrogen gas when inflamed during calm weather in marshy situations. Five to the prevailing belief that effect which cannot readily be accounted for, or which are caused by the contact of the invisible fluids, or media, always in action in the great laboratory of nature, are produced by the agency of spirits or demons, which belief concurring with the unknown causes of the effects and affording a steady ready solution of difficulties prevents further inquiry, silences, reasoning, and tending consequence to sustain the prevailing errors and superstitions.

Frank Key  21:50
Such other general causes of ghosts spirits, charms, miracles, and supernatural appearances. They all arise either from hallucinations of the mind or senses, from the mutual action of the natural though invisible powers of gaseous and the theory of fluid from the delusions of ignorance, implicit faith, or the absence of all reasoning. And those were the thoughts of Sir Richard Phillips, on a morning's walk from London to cue nearly 200 years ago.

Now, as promised, the sequel to the exciting story of agneta and Annie freed and Benny and Bjorn returning from Bell shows as feast agneta and Benny grew increasingly despondent, and by the time they reached the hotel, both of them were staggering under the oppressive weight of grim Scandinavian misery. If Fernando were here, groaned Benny, he would brighten things up, he could draw some beans from a cucumber. You forget that Fernando is but a fictional character in a song lit Benny snapped agneta tears were rolling down her cheeks. Oh, said Benny staring out of the hotel window. He saw me Fred flipped past like a phantom agneta was beating her fist upon a piece of pine furniture. At least here there is no mysterious writing upon the wall, as there was at the feast, added Benny trying to open a crack in the gloom. All of a sudden, Bjorn came striding manfully into the hotel lobby, his hair and beard and face and clothing were blackened from the charcoal he had been burning. I am looking for Annie fried, he said. Have you seen her? No, said Benny lying through his teeth. But had he really seen her? Or were his eyes playing tricks on him again, as they had in Uppsala tracks the abandoned cow buyer, said agneta she went there earlier to clean her rifle. Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in her hand, said beyond, he dashed outside into the mist that engulfed the hotel grounds. agneta and Benny slumped in the lobby armchairs expecting to hear a rifle shot in the distance, but none came. The only sound was the whirring of the fan above their heads and outside the strange cries of sight Scandinavian birds as had not flown south for the winter. Anyway, how would Fernando draw some beams from a cucumber? asked agneta eventually. But Benny had fallen asleep, lost in dreams of Belshazzar.

Frank Key  25:50
You might be wondering, where the business about sunbeams and cucumbers comes from. It In fact comes from life in the sickroom essays of an invalid by Harriet martineau. Published in 1844. She writes, I would recommend the project of drawing some beams from cucumbers as a solace on the rack. Another solace on the rack is listening to the hooting yard chant

Frank Key  26:35
hooting haha and cozy bow. We will vanquish photos where all the flowers gone. Hootie, Hootie Yeah. And that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to tune into resonance over the weekend for the fundraising marathon. I will be on at 130 on Sunday 130 in the afternoon to two o'clock on Sunday. And I will be auctioning some very exciting items a copy of Derek's the dust particle and a copy of Bring me the head of Derek's the dust particle. Sadly, the third title in the trilogy, the bitter tears of Derrick the dust particle was never actually written or illustrated. Those are two books by written by Perry Natal and with illustrations by me. And I will also have to for you to bid for a set of the five issues of massacre magazine, which appeared between 1988 to 1993. Or possibly 1989 and 1994. Yeah, fantastic. opportunity to get your hands on the very rare, complete set of massacre. More details about that on Sunday. That will be Sunday the second of may from 130 to two but obviously you will be listening from noon to midnight on both Saturday and Sunday, won't you? Yes. So we'll find out what happens next week by which time we may find out find out even more about Agnes or and Benny and Annie fried and beautiful bye for now.
