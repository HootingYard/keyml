Good evening, this is halting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. With me, Frank key. And I've kind of got myself together rather late in the day, but with a bit of luck. I should be reading to you any second. If I can remember what I meant to be doing. I do apologize for the less than fantastic beginning to the show. But that's just how it goes, you know? Anyway, let us imagine you're sitting at home in an armchair with your feet up, listening to Scriabin on the radio perhaps? or reading Martin Amos is very sensible new novel, Lionel as Bo state of England, or simply gazing vacantly into space like a dimwit or a simpleton. So you need to actually be a dimwit or a simpleton. Maybe dozing, half asleep at the border of the land of nod. Then imagine that your puppet rushes into the room from the front garden, crying, Dennis, Dennis, come and see. Whatever you have been doing or not doing, you sit bolt upright and ask, what is it come and see the shoveler Christ he or puppet, it is important to note. And indeed, it's the very crux of my argument, that while still sat in your armchair before following your puppet out to the front garden, you do not know what she is talking about. Note to that I didn't say you have no idea what she's talking about. There is a difference and a critical one. It's not the case, that at this stage, you have no idea. On the contrary, you have a very good idea. You know that once you're in the front garden, in response to your puppet urgent beckoning, you will see one of two things, but because you do not know which it's fair to say that you do not know what she's talking about. Last, may we calibrate to the efficacy of human communication through words. Let's just leave you in your armchair for a moment and examine what you know. You know that from the vantage point of your front garden, a shovel can be seen, but what kind of shovel there are, as I have indicated to type the shovel or maybe a person with a shovel, or it may be a duck. Before hoisting yourself out of the armchair and making your slow creaking exhausted way into the front garden. You might want to ascertain the type of shovel or your puppet is eager for you to see. You can ask, Is it a person with a shovel or a duck? But it may be that your puppet has already rushed back out and is out of earshot, in which case you might make an educated guess.

Frank Key  03:33
For example, which type of shoveler is likely to spark your puppet excitement, and spark it sufficiently that she wishes to share it with you? If you will show you both are fanatical ornithologist. It's a near certainty so she's talking about a duck. But what if ornithology plays Another important part in either of your lives? astonishingly, such people do exist? In that case, guesswork will avail you little conversely, your home might be slap bang next to important roadworks on the blister line bypass the racket of which has been causing you grief while listening to Scriabin or reading Martin Amos or dropping off to sleep. In that case, in all likelihood, your puppet has seen a person with a shovel. But why would that spark her excitement, so much so that she rushes in to tell you about it and rushes out again to see even if we grant the possibility that you or she or both are fanatical civil engineers, there will be shovelers that is persons with shovels are plenty to be seen for the duration of the roadworks which being important will be a period of weeks or even months on balance and irrespective of your fanaticism or lack of it in the field of civil engineering. You may you might decide that the duck is the more probable shoveler based on the information thus far available, even if neither you nor your puppet are fanatical ornithologist, she may have been struck by a sense of wonder out of the blue, as sometimes people are at the sight of a bird. There is literature on such as Tiffany's. With you still in your armchair, we have been able to weigh the likelihood of the type of shovel your puppet wants you to see. We cannot say for certain it's a duck. But the chances are that it is narrowing it further to a red shoveler Cape shoveler Australasian shoveler or Northern shoveler we'll have to wait until you make it to the front garden and see for yourself and less impatient, your puppet rushes back in to implore you to hurry in which case you can ask. Of the four types of dabbling ducks with long, broad spatula shaped beaks known as shovelers, which is it? Beware, however, that you will only get a sensible answer to this question if a your puppet is a fanatical ornithologist, and be if the shoveler she has seen is indeed a duck and not a person with a shovel. For less let's not forget the type of traveller is not yet settled beyond all doubt. by deciding on the balance of probabilities that your puppet is talking about a duck does not mean we can airily dismiss the possibility and it's no more than that. Though she's talking about a person with a shovel. We can briefly examine the circumstances, which makes that actually more likely than the duck. What if we ask? And it's often the prefix to a question which can yield significant if unexpected results. What is the shoveler your puppet spotted was a person with a shovel who was not engaged in important roadworks on the blister lane bypass, but was a grave digger the side of a person with a shovel digging a grave just out with your front garden would be cause for surprise and alarm, would it not, it could be considered a portent, even a supernatural vision. Key to deciding if this could be the cause of your puppet excited rushing in would be her tone of voice and her countenance. Innocent excitement as occasioned by a bird epiphany can easily be confused with fright or terror. It may be that your puppet is on the verge of hysteria and nervous collapse. Having seen a sinister figure digging a grave just outside your front garden, a grave vasse intended as in a vision for you or your puppet, or both. We might argue that she would have said Grave Digger, not shoveler. But it's worth remembering that when on the verge of history or nervous collapse language can become skewed or fractured or otherwise dislodged from the norm.

To know beyond all doubt what your puppet is talking about language itself is not enough, you are going to have to hoist yourself out of your armchair and see for yourself. That is the basis of all science.

This page is dedicated to a person who I just saw poking their head through the studio door. I hope he's listening. facecloth which some people continue to insist on calling Facebook in spite of my cajoling grows ever more ubiquitous. At times, it really does seem to have taken over the world efforts by others to supplant it. Google Plus, for example, have only limited success. And I think this might be because the alternative so far are too similar to face cloth. There's also the fact that Zuckerberg and his minions adapt their monolith to ape the best features They're competitors. What this suggests to me is that if there is to be a social networking site that can consign facecloth to the dustbin of history, it will have to be so far in advance of the original. That little mark will take one look at it burst into tears, dismantle his entire operation and retire from the fray. I think I have now come up with the goods daddio. My insight was granted by going back to basics, and considering the original name facecloth sorry, face book. As far as I'm aware, this refers to the practice of American higher education colleges have issuing yearbooks containing snapshots and potted biographies of their students. Little Mark Zuckerberg took that very simple format as the building block for world domination. But they are in I realized, like the seeds of his destruction. Break the word into face, cloth, sorry, book face book. It's also damn two dimensional photographs of faces gathered in a book of flat pages with printed words. It's just not good enough, even when modified and complicated and transformed into a global phenomenon on the internet, it seems clear to me that the whole thing needs to be shifted up in just three dimensions. And that is the beauty of head bag. Just think, Why be satisfied with the face when you could have the whole head? And what kind of nincompoop would be happy with a book of flat paper pages when they could have a bag packed with solid objects? It's so blindingly obvious, I'm surprised nobody's thought of it before. But perhaps they have and have raised objections. After all, if you're gonna stuff a bag full of head, where are you going to get the heads from? We don't want to encourage those Islamised. nutcases whose greatest joy in life we're not persecuting women, is to chop off the heads of infidels. But using the kind of lateral thinking espoused by Grenier says like Edward six hat de Bono, we need not cram our bag with human heads. Instead, we can use cabbages as a substitute. Carefully picked cabbage heads are about the weight, size and shape of human heads. And if you're pernickety, you can always draw facial features on the cabbage with a magic marker and apply a variety of superb and exciting hairstyles with cotton wool and glue. It is then a simple case of shopping say half a dozen or even a baker's dozen of cabbages into a burlap sack of the appropriate size. And voila, you have signed up to head bag. You will receive a complimentary metal Tapping Machine message to which you should respond using a special code to demonstrate that you are a real person toting a real bag filled with real cabbages. Once that's received and processed and filed away in a filing cabinet drawer. Head bag IQ you're often away. What we found in our preliminary research was that the best way to network with other head bag users was to find a suitable three dimensional real world location and to gather their ecoview with your burlap sack of cabbages,

caves, particularly caves by the seaside proved to be the best spots of all. A particular advantage is that they tend not to be haunted by anybody else. vagrants, drunks and riffraff are all more likely to be found slumped in municipal parks and on the outskirts of leisure and retail facilities, whereas the caves we recognize were empty. Occasionally, there might be a small creeping creature of dubious provenance scuffling about, but they can always be stamped on or if of a somewhat larger bulk sprayed with a canister of some death delivering chemical compound. When the cave is properly vacant, it makes for a splendid meeting place for head bag users. You might want to take along a torch or a Telly lamp and a packed lunch. There are all sorts of rewarding ways that a group of persons each with a bag full of cabbages can interact. You probably don't need me to tell you what they are. In fact, doing so would fatally undermined the sheer beauty of the head bag experience which is posited on Users full control. There is none of that sneaky shenanigans going on in the background that you get with facecloth none of your details will be passed to sinister multinational corporations, you will not find the data trail linking you to unseemly or criminal activities. Know, with head bag, you can be sure your privacy is safe. You sit in a cave by the sea with other users clutching your sack of cabbages and do whatever you want to do without head back to interfering in any way. All we ask is that you'd be very careful to Scarpa before the tide comes in, flooding the cave, as tides tend to do. One question that often crops up at our marketing seminars is how we will make sufficient money from head back to reduce the little Mark Zuckerberg to comparative penury, and have him come groveling to our door with a begging bowl. In the interest of robust transparency and transparent robustness. I should point out that your burlap sack will carry advertising stencilled on using luminous ink or paint which will be visible in the dank darkness of your cave. That is our only concession to the commercial realm. Please do not believe any stories you read in the press that we have plans to force users to rent their cabbages from us. You're free to buy them from your local greengrocers or hypermarket, or even to grow them yourself on your allotment out beyond the viaduct by the railway tracks. That is the head bag way like it or lump it.

I am weary writing down a list. So little has my last one to do with it, which alone could be its interest for me. I believe I could stop short. The London years are not definite or fertile in disengaged remembrances like the scotch ones, dusty dam, and beautiful they still seem to me in comparison, and my poor genies problem is so mixed with confusing intricacies to me that I cannot sort it out into clear articulation at all, or give the features of it as before. The general type of it is shining Lee clear to me a noble fight at my side, a valiant strangling of serpents day after day Don Gailey by her for most part, as I had to do it angrily and gloomily. Thus we went on together, either me, either me. That was Thomas Carlyle recalling his wife Jane Welsh in his reminiscences published in 1881. It was a rain swept gloomy afternoon in Chelsea when the doorbell clanged at the house on train walk. Sparky chatterbox, and letter writer Jane Welsh went to answer it herself, for she had given all the servants of day off to enjoy the rain and gloom. She opened the door to reveal standing on the step at all, Angular, dusty creaking, tatty, bristly fellow, whose eyes were like fathomless whirlpools. Excuse me? He might have been a chimney sweep. Had he been dustier? And the dust blacker? As it was? She recognized him immediately. Not surprisingly, as he called it the house at about this time, every single day. All snaky, she cried, you're a tad early. Yes, Mrs. Carlisle. So I am I hope not inconveniently so I'm afraid my appointment because absolutely trucker at the moment. So I've had to squeeze you in today as best I can. Well, I'm indebted to you for fitting us in. You know your way to the parlor, go silver. Why My life at Mr. Carlisle and while old snakey made his way to the parlor, Jane Welsh Carlisle climbed halfway up the stairs towards the attic, where her husband sat scribbling away at his interminable biography of Frederick the Great old Thomas Thomas, she cried, but it was no use. The attic was soundproofed to blot out the sound of the next door neighbor's rackety hens and a train whistles, both of which drove the Scottish Sage crackers. Drain climb further up the stairs until she was at the door of the attic, flung it open and announced in a bright and cheerful voice. Thomas, you must come down at once. I'm so happy the snake charmer is here isn't a tad early ground the irascible Scottish polymath. Oh, don't get all grumpy Thomas, pleaded Jane. She was in high spirits ever since the arrival of old snaky. The pair of them made their way down to the parlor, Jane skipping with glee, Thomas glowering with anger. What will always carry on I'm never going to finish my life of Frederick the Great, he moaned. Oh, I'm sure you will Thomas, even if it takes you 13 years of ultimately worthless toil, said drain while having a happy ditty. In the parlor, old snake, he was sitting in an armchair, getting himself into what generations yet to come would call the zone. You too can make idle chitchat while I fetch the tall and four shaped wicker baskets from the seller, said Jane in high frolic. But the snake charmer and the proto fascist sat in silence until Jane returned, lugging the two tall and four shaped wicker baskets she had fetched from the seller. Do you have any preferences today? asked old snaky. I'd like a boa constrictor, please, shouted Jane with unrestrained glee. And what about you, Thomas? A Python, a viper, a borrowing ASP. But Thomas merely granted Oh, you're such an all misery. Guts said giggly and Jane. Give him a surprise then old sneaky, she added,

which the snake charmer took from his pocket a flute or pipe of mysterious oriental origin, and proceeded to play upon it a mesmerizing melody of mysterious oriental origin. And as he played, so the lids of the tool and four shaped wicker baskets was dislodged from within, and out of each came crawling a serpent, a boa constrictor, and a diamond back rattlesnake. Ooh, how unbearably thrilling. cried Jane. We haven't had a diamond back. rattlesnake before. Isn't that exciting Thomas. But Thomas Carlyle, his head still stuffed with what he called Prussian blockhead. ism, was hardly listening. Well, said old snakey, replacing his mysterious oriental flute or pipe in his pocket. I have much to do. So I shall take your leave. I'll let myself out. See you tomorrow. And he left the room, leaving the Carlisle's and the serpent alone together. No sooner had he gone. Then drain sprang upon the boa constrictor laughing her head off and strangled it with her bare hands. Your turn Thomas, come on, cheer up. But Carlisle loomed but as Carlisle loomed above the diamond back rattlesnake with murder in his eyes. There was no lightning is the craigan patak savants mood. He was angry. He was as gloomy as the Chelsea weather. He fell upon the serpent, with all his bottle that ferocity and gripped its throat in his big hairy fist, and squeezed and squeezed and squeezed, until the serpent sank, limp and dead upon the carpet. Beside him, Jane Carlisle clapped her hands like an overexcited child. Tip Top Southern strangling Thomas. She yelled, well, that's that done for another day. You can go back to your attic and write more guff about Frederick the Great, I will throw the corpses of the serpent over the fence into next door garden. I expect that's why his damned hens make so much damn noise. shouted Thomas Carlyle. And he putted up the stairs. Outside, it was still rain swept and gloomy. It was another 19th century afternoon in train walk in Chelsea. Hi, Dan the item the

got time for on hooting yard for this week. I hope you've enjoyed the show. I should point out that the details of the Carlisle's in that last piece were all absolutely true. Carlisle did have a soundproofed attic, particularly to guard him against the noise of the next door hens and railway whistles and, and Hooters, which really upset him. And he did spend 13 years writing an interminable biography of Frederick regrade, which even he thought that no one would ever read. I don't know if anyone listening has ever read it. If you have, please do contact me at the usual address, hooting yado tree gmail.com because it will be nice to know that someone has read Carlisle's life of Frederick the Great upon which he toiled while his wife was happily strangling serpents. Yeah. Okay, that's it back next week with more stuff. Bye bye.
