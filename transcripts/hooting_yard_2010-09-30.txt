Good evening, this is indeed resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. And my name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Last week we began are going through the alphabet. I'm currently posting on the hooting yard website alphabetically, and decided to repeat the experience on the air. So that's what we're doing. So before we continue halfway through, ah, just a couple of couple of other things. I mentioned the website do visit hooting yard.org. And the other thing is that on Sunday, eight o'clock, or 730, at the jellyfish theater, of Union Street on Union Street, and the resonance radio orchestra is having an evening of music and you should be there and part of it will be me and the great lepke key be collaborating on a piece. So I recommend that you turn up for that cost five pounds. And if you're not sure where the jellyfish theater is, Google it, it's in London. So those of you listening elsewhere in the world will have to make your travel plans anyway. Ah, we were at age and it was the the the H section in our alphabet is a quotation from an essay called the mind snatchers by Frederick crews in a in his collection follies of the wise, and we ended with a horrifying image of alien abductee Katharina Wilson, who apparently had an experience with an alien masquerading as Al Gore. Fredrik Cruz goes on to say once recollections of this kind of taken to be authentic guesswork as to the aliens true nature and purpose becomes irresistible. What if, for example, Katharina Wilson's visitor wasn't just masquerading as Al Gore, but was Al Gore. The hybrid or body snatcher has already replaced the man from Tennessee. And if so, the alien takeover of our executive branch surely wouldn't have stopped at the second in command. Consider this provocative observation by the renowned abduction expert David M. Jacobs. Because the light state hybrid IDs are mainly human, they have strong sexual drives, but little conscience. It's as if they have human attributes but lack human controls. Even if they do have a conscience. They know that the human victim will immediately forget what happened to her. The hybrid might assume there is no lasting effect upon the human and he can therefore do and say anything he pleases with impunity. And Frederick Cruz adds could the space creature who assumed the form of Bill Clinton had been hideously mocking us when it kept invoking executive privilege

on the song, insurance company man from the album up Murphy Street, Father orchestra Murphy, there's a great line Oh, is he an angel? Or the great god Pan? My insurance company man. And I you know alphabet is for insurance company men. If you'd set your sights on becoming a Titan of modernism. There was a time early in the last century, where a career in the insurance industry must have seemed dairy girls. Forget all that twaddle about the starving artist in the garrote. The insurance office was clearly the place to be. Consider the man who began his career with Charles H. Raymond and CO and in 1907 formed Ives and Myrick with offices in New York City. And the man who after a series of insurance jobs in New York joined the Hartford accident and indemnity company in Connecticut in 1916. And on the other side of the Atlantic, the man whose career began as a large Italian insurance company, but who in 1988 took up a post at the workers' Accident Insurance Institute for the kingdom of Bohemia. The three were Charles Ives 1874, to 1954 Wallace Stevens 1879 to 1955 and Franz Kafka 1883 to 1924. in their daily lives, it was the insurance business that consumed their time and energies, recognition as artists came late to both Ives and Stevens, and was of course for catholica posthumous what would have happened if the three had met if say, in 1928, had been a delegate at some kind of joint United States Kingdom of Bohemia insurance convention, would their talk has been of actuarial tables and acts of God sitting down together at the convention dinner, might they have passed the time without one's divulging that one was a composer, one a poet, one a writer. The dinner may have been something of a trial for Casco was an enthusiastic flat jurist chewing each mouthful 32 times and his table manners were disgusting. Wallace Stevens may have got into an argument about something and broken his fist on Charles Ives his jaw, just as he once did when he punched Ernest Hemingway at a party. Charles Ives in his turn, may have risen from his seat and shouted, sit down pinback your ears and listen to like a man, as he once did at a rare public performance of one of his compositions. All my any altercation had been calmed by Kapha suggesting to his fellows that after dinner, they walked down to the river clamber into rowing boats and engage in his favorite form of strenuous exercise. I like to think of the three of them heads buzzing with insurance matters, rolling down the river after dinner. And then perhaps, but the protagonists of Charles Ives, his second string quartet, climbing up a mountain to view the boundless firmament.

The OECD defines jiggery pokery as deceitful or dishonest manipulation, Hocus Pocus, humbug by Ed, I'm in the Oxford English Dictionary, of course, the common reference of that abbreviation, the out of print pamphleteer Dobson however, tried to foist upon the world another Oh, ed. The Omnia on the Encyclopedia daab. Sonia, we must be careful when plowing through the works of the pamphleteer not to mistake one OED for the other. If we look up jiggery pokery in Dobson's own OED, we're told simply see pamphlet. In fact, pretty much anything we look up in Dobson's OLED carries the same advice or instruction. It's difficult to see the point of this so called reference work, which consumed many many hours of the pamphleteers time. Even if we consider it as a sort of universal index to the contents of his pamphlet. It is by and large, worthless as he never Dane's to inform us which particular pamphlet he's in joining us to see. In the case of jiggery pokery, though, we're on firm ground. The pamphlet to which the Omni encyclopedia dot Sonia refers must be the history theory and practice of jiggery pokery from ancient times up to yesterday morning with practical tips and cutouts and keep cardboard display models for your mental peace out of print. Barely a dozen pages. The pamphlet is distressingly brief, and nowhere does Dobson grant us a definition. So we're never entirely clear what he means or understand by the term jiggery pokery. There is one lengthy paragraph which seeks to describe in mind numbing detail, a series of manipulations, passing movements, flummery and gesticulations. And hoo ha. Which the pamphleteer watched being performed by a man he describes as a shattered ship's captain on board a boat playing an unidentified sound on New Year's Eve 1949. If we accept this to be a description of jiggery pokery, when none the wiser regarding its purpose, as Dobson does not bother to tell us one suspects he had no idea what he was looking at. The pamphlets title makes great claims which only the most charitable reader could consider a med. History. Well, Dobson has a couple of sentences in which he makes glancing reference to well known instances of jiggery pokery by laws pause on clues, and one eyed her ratios. Copley's and does that funny business involving a certain Frankish King, but we're left scratching our heads wondering what on earth is talking about? I just scratched my head Incidentally, and a beetle fell out of my Buffon time to wash my hair with a proprietary shampoo, white there.

I've returned cleaned and primed and ready to proceed. Where we are Yes, if the history element of the pamphlets title is scarcely justifiable. What about theory? on page five Dobson announces with quiet menace, the time has come to consider jiggery pokery in the abstract. This is menacing because anybody who's even a passing acquaintance with the pamphlet his work knows that when he embarks upon passages of abstraction, the best thing to do is to bash one's head repeatedly against the surface of adamantine hardness, until one loses consciousness. There was a time when I was foolishly attempting to write a magazine article entitled abstract Dobson when I actually installed a rectangular panel of granite next to my writing desk, so I could do the bashing without having to get up from my chair. If you fear your cranium cannot withstand repeated bashing, it's important to find an alternative method of dealing with the all too potent horrors of Dobson in abstract mode. Some illegal pharmacists with pharmacies tucked away down sordid alleyways may be able to procure for you the kinds of powdered tranquilizers that can stand an entire herd of cattle, but ingesting them even in a burger Mater scented to same has its own risks. Some more experienced Dobson have tried the trick of simply flipping past the awful pages and resuming their reading. When the pamphleteer gets some sense back into his head. Do what you have to do. For now, all I will say about Dobson's theory of jiggery pokery is glob glob glob glob. Some of you will recognize that as the telephone call made by a terrifying semi aquatic creature in the thing on the doorstep by HP Lovecraft warning enough, I think. And so we come to practice, which I suppose Dobson addresses in that interminable paragraph about the shattered ship's captain. But as we've seen, whether what he witnessed was jiggery pokery, or some kind of maritime ballet is by no means clear. Over the years, I have watched various crew members of ships from rear admirals to barnacle scrapers perform all sorts of baffling physical maneuvers, and not once have I thought any of it fitted the definition of jiggery pokery except on one occasion, when I was aboard a very sinister ship, which sailed into a clammy mist, in which all sorts of ugly shenanigans took place until at the last I was marooned with several other paying passengers upon a remote at all, populated only by squelchy creeping things and bereft of paper and pencils, and writing desks and panels of adamantine hardness. Luckily, the one brine soaked Dobson pamphlet I managed to salvage from the ship was written in his more familiar, majestic sweeping paragraphs, with Nereus pipit of abstraction within it. It's titled by the way with popular games and pastimes, suitable for those marooned on remote atolls pending rescue by a ship of fools out of print. Returning to the pamphlet under discussion, my copy of the history theory and practice of jiggery pokery from ancient times up to yesterday morning with practical tips and cutouts and keep cardboard Display models for your mantel piece contains neither practical tips nor cutout and keep cardboard display models for my mantle piece. Not that I have a mental piece in my chalet for architectural reasons. I suspect Dobson upended these items in his title to woo a wider readership, attracting the kinds of people who like practical tips and the construction of cardboard display models. I once cut out from a Kellogg's cornflakes carton and constructed and kept a cardboard display model of the head, just the head of Henry the Eighth. But that was long ago, when I was young and tiny. And almost as long ago it was last. Both the last the time of my youth and the cardboard head last to one suspect the Wits of Dobson when he sat down to write his jiggery pokery pamphlet. Perhaps that was his own kind of jiggery pokery. As a pamphleteer, to convince us he was a sensible man writing sensible prose, when more often than not, he was a nincompoop.

I decided that k in our alphabetic shedule stands for knowledge, more specifically, the status of knowledge, how we know what we know, and how we can know things which we know are untrue. Actually, the reason k stands for knowledge is for the simple reason that I wanted to mention a splendid blog posted by the blogger backwaters, man. Now the title of this postage was Napoleon's last words, colon, weasel trappers may be lurking in your area. Having just read the title, and been astounded, I know that I now know that the last words of the Emperor Napoleon were weasel trappers may be lurking in your area, alas and alack. I then continued to read the full postage on the blog site. And though I was mightily entertained and learned a thing or two, I was shattered to discover that these were not Napoleon's last words, nor had anybody ever claimed to be. But to look on the bright side, there's a part of my brain that will always have the comfort of once very briefly on that day, having known that they were

L stands for both letters and leaks. And you may actually need to visit the website to get the full impact of this particular letter because it depends on a couple of pictures. The first was that According to the BBC, there was much amusement recently, when police in Hampshire released an E fit picture of a burglary suspect who appeared to be wearing a lettuce on his head. You can see that picture on the hooting yard website. But what's gone unremarked is the possibility that the image may be devastatingly accurate, and it's the habit of burglars and other near do wells in the Hampshire area to sport the makings of salads upon their boxes. It would not surprise me if some urban folklorist attached perhaps to a Polytechnic was at this very moment preparing a monograph on say the radish wearing footpad of Gosport or the Winchester watercress rascal. a wider range of vegetables has been used by miscreants camps in the past, of course, though, for hiding behind rather than wearing openly upon the head. Six long years ago, hooting yard, we dealt in passing with the case of the chap who sculpt on the cover of a salaried array of leaks dangling from the ceiling. And you can see that picture on the website too. We move on to M for which you don't need any visual aids. M is for me, that is Dr. Richard mead 1673 to 1754 and also for his medica Sacra, or a commentary on the most remarkable diseases mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. 1748 posthumously reprinted 1755. Here you can read about the diseases of job jehoram, Judas, Herod and others, also have palsy demoniacs and the bloody sweat of Christ. The full text of the book is online, but to whet your appetite, here is part of me each chapter on the disease of our old pal, King Nebuchadnezzar. Those things which are related of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, appear so surprising and contrary to nature, that some interpreters have imagined that he was really transformed into a beast for being driven from the company of men for seven years. His dwelling was with the beasts of the field, he fed on grass as oxen, his body was wetted with a Jew of heaven. His hair and nails were grown like those of birds. At length of the end of that space of time, his understanding was restored to him, and he was established in His Kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto him. Now his crime was pride and the contempt of God. See the book of Daniel, chapters four and five. All the circumstances agree so perfectly well with hypochondriac or madness, that to me, it appears evident that Nebuchadnezzar was seized with this distemper and under its influence, ran wild into the fields, and that fancying himself transformed into an ox, he fed on grass, in the manner of cattle, that every sort of madness is, as I shall specify more particularly here after a disease of a disturbed imagination, which this unhappy man labored under for seven years, and through neglect of taking proper care of himself. His hair and nails grew to excessive the length, whereby the latter growing sticker and crooked resembled the claws of birds. Now, the ancients called persons affected with this species of madness, like cancer boy, or kind anthropoid because they went abroad in the night, imitating wolves or dogs, particularly intent upon opening the sepal because of the dead and had their legs much also rated either by frequent falls, or the bites of dogs. I posted that on Saturday and given the day, I wondered that maybe Pat m ought to have stood for Miliband. But there again, if we were going to have a m a denden. I prefer that it was this quotation from Charles Darwin from one of his letters. Would anyone trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind

we enter the second half of our alphabet with n, which could have been for Nebuchadnezzar had we not dealt with that kings wild manias and the M for need, and medica Sacra that being so n is fun, nothing. Oh, what horror to bite on nothing sang Peter Blake that once upon a time, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Our next letter, oh, could be taken for nothing, too. If it were to be misread as zero, which it can be if you're not looking carefully and give a damn about context. Iggy Pop claims that his band The Stooges has the best band name ever, simply because of that EU in the middle. But the EU sound written down can also be interpreted as a double zero, a double nothingness. As in, for example, the surname of the poet Rupert Brooke, propelled into the nothingness as death by a gnat bite to his lip as he sailed towards the Dardanelles. And again, literally. Edgar Allan Poe has just the one Oh, the center of his surname, the out of a mile strong, such as the miles strong that lies in wait for Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, as he vanishes into a white nothingness. He has a central Oh in his surname coupled by the owner of his real surname, Osterberg, but I will not be babbling about always owes now when we're speaking of n, when we're speaking of nothing. Oh, actually is for O's in man DS. My name is Jose Mandy at King of kings. Look on my works ye mighty and despair now As it happens, I am mighty. And I was hanging around once Thursday morning on the boundless and bear lone and level sands. And I took the opportunity to look on the works of the King of kings, and I did not despair. What I did was guff for, well, first I benched for I just finished eating a big pie. Two dozen blackbirds baked in puff pastry with a side helping of spring onions and marmalade. I Belgian and then I guffawed. Not everyone is able to admit a full throated guffaw in all its glory, but I can. I used to be a chocolate, but that was before I embraced my mightiness and developed a guffaw to go with it. I was taught it by a mountebank on a seaside Pier, far away from the sands on which I was prancing on that Thursday morning. I had been sent to inspect the works of Mandy as by one mightier than myself, if you can imagine such a percentage. This unbelievably mighty White was so mighty, he would have flicked those amandus from his mighty presence, as if the King of kings were a mere fly or a blue bottle. He my mighty employer had not had a moment to spare to go and see the works of those Amanda's but you've heard reports and was aware of the accepted wisdom that looking on them could plunge him into despair. Such a prospect confounded his mighty brain. So he took me on as a sort of surveyor emissary at a handsome salary. Go there and look upon the works of Rosa Mandy as King of kings. He boomed in his mighty baritone at the conclusion of my interview, and make haste to return to my mighty office on the top floor of this mighty skyscraper, and tell me of your findings. Though you are a mere speck of weakness in comparison to me, you are yet sufficiently mighty to be in a position to test the authenticity of ozone Mandi acids claim. Before leaving the skyscraper, I called into the PX to collect a wardrobe pie coupons as I was counting them and calculating how many Blackbird pies I would be able to devour during my survey. It so happened that the mountebank who had taught me to guff or popped in I hear you're going to look on the works of Rosa Mandy as King of kings. He said, Gosh, news travels mighty fast in this skyscraper. I replied that it does set the mountebank but remember, this skyscraper mighty as it is will one day topple or be toppled and be naught but dust and ashes. In fact, I have it on good authority that such top element may well occur before you have time to return from the boundless and bear lone and level sands from which you are headed. Really? I asked. The mountebank tapped a finger on the side of his nose and the universal jet conspiratorial celebratory and they slipped away his cape billowing behind him with controlled urgency and stylish land.

Frank Key  28:04
And that is why on that Thursday morning, some weeks later, I guffawed as I looked on the works of Mandy as King of Kings for the mighty skyscraper toppled and in its top moment, my mighty employer had perished. I had my fat salary and half my wardrobe pie coupons and a belly full of black both pie and spring onions and marmalade, and I'd never returned from the boundless and belling level sands. Here I could build my own mighty works and guff for the universe. Now, there was none mightier than me. That's the end of this week's show. We'll carry on next week, beginning with
