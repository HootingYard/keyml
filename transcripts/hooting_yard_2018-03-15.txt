Out on the air and my name is Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM. I've really enjoyed last week's show which was presented in its entirety by pansy cradle Jew. And I have to say I'm a bit miffed that isn't a word miffed? Yeah. I'm a bit miffed that I actually have to do the show myself this week. I think the idea of getting different people in to present the show is a great idea. And I should do it more often. And then you wouldn't have to listen to me. However, you stuck with me for this week. And I Easter is almost upon us. And I was disconcerted. I crawled back through the hooting yard archives all what 1415 years of them online. And I noticed that every single Easter has passed, without the appearance of what one would have thought was the central the hunting yard Easter Gift Guide. God alone knows how you lot have coped anyway, following an exclusive commercial tie in with the most gorgeous department store in the known universe, who Berman's I am now. I'm now I can now rectify this terrible omission. So here are five su purgative gifts for Easter. Available at bargain bin prices from a bin outside the bargain bin basement at Huberman beacon store in pointy town. gumbo sack of agricultural waste matter. The perfect gift for the peasant in your life. And mind numbingly gigantic burlap sack absolutely crammed packed with noise some summary and farm filth. Or you could get a wandering mendicants collapsed lung preserved in jelly surgically removed by top doctors from the corpse of a wandering mendicant. This collapsed lung has been expertly preserved in special jelly is what it says on the jar. Or you could get a two in one Marionette made from old coat hangers rags and solidified puff pastry. This fascinating puppet looks just like Yoko Ono, until you turn it round and tweak it a bit when voila, you have a lifelike Bernard Cribbins doll hours of fun with two of your favorite nonfiction characters. Note provide your own string what you could get Grow Your Own marsh. Transform your living room into an airy Marsh complete with muffit vapors in explicable darting light and pipe smoking Marsh bright. Simply sprinkle the contents of the sachet onto your carpet and watch it dissolve before sinking up to your armpits and flailing hopelessly, just like say bon baring Gould. And finally, perhaps the most wonderful Easter present of all the radiating mounds of St. Papa. If you have any Belgian Catholics in your family, they will treasure this miniature plastic toy lands radiating fire from heaven, just like the lands of St poppo 879 77 to 1048 one of the first Flemish pilgrims to the Holy Land.

Frank Key  04:50
Of course, I have many Belgian Catholics in my family some of them are lapsed not Latin. Belgium's lapsed Catholics. Many In fact, I could list them for you. Maybe one day I'll tell you that my uncle is there, who was a fine man. No longer with us, unfortunately, but a splendid splendid family uncle and a Belgian lapsed Catholic. The emblems of inanity are vivid blindingly So, gold leaf is used sparingly. Most but not all other work of ferdinando do dargle banchi and Mukherjee ifoam little is known and that little spurious bird motifs is used sparingly, but not as sparingly as gold leaf. Tremendous splattering is de rigueur. The viewers headaches, thump and throb. ferdinando do dargle banchi and mkaradjis own headaches are one of the few non spurious things we know of him. There are documents the gulf between head and eight was sometimes as wide as one of those big expansive sees one finds in the wet part of the earth. Dust covered some but not all of the emblems. One thinks of adjusters Captain bells hanging where they do or tucked up with metal tags, or tacked up with metal tags. The emblems of inanity gain moral heft. Several ditches were emptied of mud that crocus scented one has particular significance that it is one of the emblems Mukherjee denied molding, it lacks gold leaf, a bird motif, even dust always wiped with the same rag frostbitten the maker or molder, or what you will was bitten by more than frost, one need only examine the pins under a microscope. The apron was a blaze and bore tremendous splatter rings. In sorry, the apron was babies and bore tremendous splattering. Big difference in strings might have been those of mocha dreams dead mother bobbed hair preserved in a jar on a shelf and unsettling momentum. When horsemen came roaring across the plains, these emblems were their purchase, rough Dunn's belt and plenty of hammers to pound, we can discern in certain emblems. pox the guttering of a type of vibrational practice or the devilment This is what cu gap was referring to. On the on the lectures now last, swollen blobs of poor ink lupine howling or or as a response preclude proper digestion. Mukherjee had a special basin for Christ's sake. Can content and context fly at each other fangs bed, one thinks of the Barbarian horseman in only one case is the bird motif done in Golden LEAF? A pretty little chaffinch, a worm dangling from its beak, its beak golden, the worm or pink that nauseate. Sometimes lamps dazzle rather than illuminate the viewers eyes scrunch and the headaches return. The Gulf widens. That sea is wetter than ever, shoes that had been laced with boggling expertise, trade on golden slabs. The cumulative effect is sub Rosa and not just Rosa. The deeper the delving the shabbiness baffles, a talk might be an improvement on the lamp. What Mukherjee saw was arguably not without effortlessness, he may have grown to manhood in an iron lung. There are more documents beneath the innocent straights run mile upon mile of tunnels for lawn and unmapped, mkaradjis longings or not detain the more somber student of his work, cut to the quick he had a pet mole.

Frank Key  09:50
As we're pound, right somewhere, have swore test night stretched over wretched men there. And it is that there that these emblems Both their best and worst and middling to inhabit, more frankly middling than otherwise. None is Swart, unless at a stretch, fixed to a torture as rack with metal tax, but could be stretched if one insisted upon it. Mukherjee did not. There are times when all was grown in the water like living things, suffering is a given. It may be that the nauseating pink worm gnaws at the emblems core hunter and hunted in sand or snow. There is a pyramid cast to those who shuffle in circles in the prison gang. Look carefully at the more vivid of the emblems and blindness wears a tricksters hat. In the end, inanity, Brooks no lump.

Frank Key  11:19
There's going to be a slight intermission now where while I attempt to find on my handheld electronic thing, the next piece I want to read to you. It's not very professional approach, but that's how it goes. Oh, here is something I've been recently I decided to rewrite the entire complete stories of Franz Kafka. Entire and complete the complete stories of Franz Kafka, the short stories, and I decided the way to do this would be to take the first and last sentence from each story and then decode everything in the middle. So, in all of the Caprica, stories I've been writing, the first sentence is, as translated from the German by one of the main translators, usually Willa and Edwin Moore, sometimes Tandy and James stern. So the first sentence is translated from the German from the original Kapha as is the last sentence. Everything in between are made up. So here is the first of my rewritings of Kapha and its wedding preparations in the country. When Edward Rabanne coming along the passage, walked into the open doorway, he saw that it was raining. The morning drizzle had become a lunchtime downpour, so teeming with the rain, that Rabanne could barely see the milk bar across the street, crushed by whether he turned abruptly returned along the passage and up the stairs, and into his rented room and flung himself onto the bed and promptly fell asleep. Shortly afterwards, without waking he rose from the bed, put on a pair of galoshes and went back out of the room and down the stairs and along the passage and into the open doorway. But this time, being fast asleep, he did not stop to consider the rain, but continued out, splashing across the puddles, splattered Street and into the milk bar. He sat at the communal table and still huddled unconscious, waved his arm in other language, foppish manner to attract the attention of the milk bar serving urging a tiny lad no more than four foot tall, with a with a leg and a pointy hat. Unlike Rabanne, this urgent boy was wide awake, almost uncannily so vividly aware of everything going on around him. From the language and foppish gestures of unconscious customers, to the scaffolding of tiny beetles across the sawdust floor of the milk bar. Now, in the ringing words of blockman, admittedly wrenched out of context, forget the somnambulist and concentrate instead, upon the urging for it is this week the milkbar factotum who played a decisive part in the history of the century, of which I Right. This tiny lad, was none other than Gus Vaughn vague inventor, or perhaps one should say discoverer of the milk mustache. It was a fashion craze that swept across the continent as relentlessly as the plague riddle rats of an earlier century. And it was more than a fad. Oh, much more. One. These only study photographs taken during the decades when the milk mustache was de rigueur. scarcely an upper lip is unadorned by a stripe of dried or drying milk. Because he was employed as a milk bar serving urging, it was long believed that Gus Vaughn Vig vis upon the milk mustache in the course of his duties, recent and fantastically in rigorous research by a Polish fashion historian popsy up to it has demonstrated beyond argument that On the contrary, unexpectedly, von Vig first gave the milk mustache a public outing, dozens of miles away from the milk bar out in the country when he attended a wedding.

Frank Key  16:18
He had been invited. The Lord only knows why, to the nuptials of babinski to the idiot half brother of the lumbering walrus, not milk mustache serial killer bubinski and his bride, the equally dim witted Babs glint Daughter of countryside folk. The wedding took place in some godforsaken rustic hellhole, a half day's train journey away from the bustling modern city, replete with street lighting and majestic boulevards and sodium flares and milk bars, where Gus Vaughn Vig, had lived all his life while he sat in locomotives, waiting for the train to chug out of the station, far away in the countryside, mama and papa grinned when making preparations for their daughter's wedding. There was a tent there were trestle tables. There were cat candidly embroidered cloth covering the tables upon each cloth with place to potato, one per table. There was every chance that pitting the wedding guests against each other in games of the often brutal peasant sport of grab of a potato would lead to unbridled violence. But both mama and papa glint were British and given to unbridled violence, as what almost all the wedding guests, as indeed was the Blushing Bride dim witted Babs. also preparing for the wedding was the local man of the cloth, the Reverend clivias man cloth, urbane hirsute, vengeful cantankerous, Petty, gassy, ferocious, dismal, harebrained hair lipped, lascivious, erudite, appalling nuts, rubicund, sordid, wintry, butter fingered, holy, brittle, bitter, blessed of the fruit of our lady's womb Jesus, half full of grace rotting from the inside, creaky blind, the Reverend man cloth was also brutish, and given to unbridled violence, but only towards puppies and kittens. His flock of peasant churchgoers, he appeared addled and incompetent, if somewhat greasy, and yet he was loved by them with a deep spiritual peasant love, akin to the love of farmer field for his favorite pig. It was appropriate then, that the vicar prepared for the wedding by wallowing among pigs in the muck in this die. What nobody could have foreseen with this squalid countryside wedding of babinski to to Babs glint would witness the public debut of the greatest upper lip fashion craze of the century. For as his train chugged slowly towards the rustic hellholes dilapidated railway station, Gus Vaughn Vig crew thirsty, he determined that the first thing he would do upon disembarking from the train was to beg a farmer for a tumbler of milk. As luck would have it, there was just such a farmer loitering on the station platform. He was on the lookout for the rail white cat for which each day he would pour a tumbler full of milk into And watch a lap. When Gus Vaughn Vig came mincing along the platform, the milk had not yet been poured into the bowl. It was still in the tumbler held in the farmers muscular and grubby peasant hand, gas bagged. The farmer explained about the cap. gasp begged further, but the farmer would not yield. Then Gus realized he had in his jacket pocket a persuasive theological tract, which, if he were to recite the more vivid passages to the farmer might change his mind. Coincidentally, this tract entitled why cats must suffer, had been written by the Reverend pluvial man cloth. It certainly proved persuasive, for no sooner had he heard four or five words of it. Then the farmer handed the tumbler of milk to Gus Vaughn vague, who dumped it down greedily, inadvertently leaving the telltale stripe of a milk mustache on his upper lip.

Frank Key  21:11
And it was last adorned that he attended the wedding. Not a single peasant expressed admiration of his milk mustache. But at the reception, when the games have grabbed the potato descended into unbridled violence, we the Vaughn Vig, sought refuge from the brutality by fleeing to a nearby newsagent kiosk. Also, at the kiosk, buying a bundle of the latest fashion magazines with the internationally celebrated Italian fashion Easter. Giuseppe Baba, Baba glance fell on the milk mustache upon vault vigs upper lip, and so great was his ecstasy that he swooned, the rest is history. A question that has always plagued those plagued by questions is precisely why bahco was so taken with the milk mustache. Sachi was influenced that within a week of the wedding, it was on the upper lips of the most fashionable people in every important city across the continent. In her research paper, policy up lip provides a simple explanation. When she writes he's instantly ecstatic about everything beautiful.

Frank Key  22:43
I think we've just got time for this. This is not a catholica story. The Compendium ruined picnics gives accounts of 1000 ruin picnics between 1959 and 2017. An unsurprising number of ruminations are caused by rainfall and wasps, but there is only one recorded picnic ruined by a panic stricken goose. This picnic took place on the 14th of January 1987, in a field hemmed by large and Sycamore not far from a farm, or better farmstead, yes, a farmstead where many geese were kept. It was a sort of goose farm state if you can imagine such a thing. The bulk or majority of the geese were content and planted, but one of their number was thrown into a state of panic by something strange and grubby and intercalate. At this distance in time, we cannot know for certain what it was precisely, or even vaguely, this thing, all it can be said for certain is that it induced panic in a single goose, which, maddened broke out of the farmstead by hurling itself repeatedly against a portion of fencing weakened by rust and metal fatigue, until it had created a gap large enough for it to go goose stepping away from the farmstead in a direct line to the field, hemmed by large and Sycamore where a picnic was on that afternoon in January, taking place. This was one of the so called picnics of piety organized by the pious and puritanical Reverend Ringo Starr, not to be confused that he often was with the drumming Beatle of the same name, though we would do well to remember that the latter adopted it as a pseudonym or stage name, whereas for the Reverend It was his real name. At least, he claimed as much, though was curiously reluctant ever to produce his birth certificate when asked, for example, by petty bureaucrats working for petty bureaucracies and similar curses upon humanity. picture them on a freezing January afternoon in a field a picnic of piety, with sausage rolls and cream crackers and marmalade and buns and digestive biscuits and reconstituted meat style Gaya teas, accompanied by flasks of spigot water. Fast or fast ish. Approaching the picnic blanket is the panic stricken goose. Nobody at the picnic sees it coming for the Reverend Ringo Starr has commanded the picnickers to shut their eyes and think pious thoughts while chewing their sausage rolls and cream crackers and marmalade and buns and digestive biscuits and reconstituted meat style gaieties and slurping this spigot water. The scene is set for the ruination of a picnic by a maddened and panic stricken goose. And that is precisely what happened. Tupperware was strewn everywhere. valuable, some might say invaluable as the Compendium is we might cement the fact that it neglects to give any details of what occurred in the aftermath of the 1000 room, picnics it covers last were left in the dark about for example, whether the January 1987 picnic of piety was able to resume after its goose visitation, or whether it was abandoned, or whether the picnickers were their eyes shut and their mind wholly concerned on pious thought, even noticed that their picnic had been ruined. We might lament these emissions and we do by weeping and singing dodges or humming them if we cannot sing in tune. There is weeping and wailing all over the nation at untold picnic ruination. untold until now. Now the tally is cold, and it makes our blood run cold.

Frank Key  27:25
do listen listeners as the end of this week shooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. I might have some more. Franz Kafka stories on gutted Franz Kafka stories for you next week. I've written 15 or 16 of them so far. You can read them all on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org each of them you can tell which ones are the Kefka stories because each of them ends by telling you that the first and last sentences were translated from German and everything in between was not so yes, end of show for this week. I will be back next week. Unless I can persuade pansy cradled you to come and read for me again. In which case I can just stay home and have a nap. Bye bye
