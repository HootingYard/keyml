Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. And my name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air, the last hooting yard of 2015 and the last one before Christmas, which I had not really prepared for. So this isn't really a Christmas edition of the show. It's just the usual stuff anymore so I was riding through the desert on a horse with no name. This was asking for trouble. And sure enough, after passing plants and birds and rocks and things and sand and hills and rings, we arrived at a horse registration station. A cow poking a poncho bit us to stop, so I pulled on the reins and patted my horse on it horsey head. Before you go any further on this register your horse, said the cow punk. Register away I said blindly, I hoped i'd practiced blindness of speech at drama school, but only now did I understand the yawning gulf between strutting upon stage the stage and negotiating the real world of deserts and course registration stations manned by in Poncho cowpokes. First, I will need the name of your horse, he said. And what will you need? Second, I asked playing for time. Second, I will need any aliases or pseudonyms by which your horse is known. I wondered what would happen if I cried up kayo Kai a and dug my spurs into the horses horse the flanks and galloped away, leaving the cowpoke in a cloud of dust. Don't get any funny ideas about galloping off on an unregistered horse said the cowpoke, adding you won't get far with an air of menace. I'm unusually alert to threat of menace by dint of hard experience, and I don't mean merely staged menace, as met within certain plays by certain dramatists. No, I mean real menace in the real world of plants and birds and rocks and things and sand and hills and rings. For one wild moment, I considered lying, plucking a name for my nameless horse from within the dark, ignorant recesses of my cranium integuments but the cow poke again for stormy was here, clairvoyant cowpoke and don't just make up a name. He warned. I will know if you're buying and by the martyred sinews of st blood West, you will not want to suffer the consequences of trying to pull the wool over my eyes. I did not doubt him. He spoke with the kind of effortless authority of a character I had once played to no little acclaim in a stage production of something or other by one of the Norwegian playwrights. I had little option but to blurt out the truth. My horse has no name. I blurted. The cowpoke did not react immediately. Then he fixed me with a gaze that would have killed the blood. Were we not broiling in the heat of the desert. He looked at me and then he looked at the horse. He rummaged in his Poncho. He hummed a snack of light Opera in grab Thea teeny atony a puppy a puppy, I think. Then he took from within his Poncho a pebble, and with sudden and devastating accurately, threw it up into the sky, and clonked a bird, which plummeted to the earth, stone dead at his feet. Each time a nameless horse tries to pass this station, he said, a bird must die. So it is written. learn that lesson. Well, stranger, now turn around and do not return. Where is it written? I asked. But the cowpoke had taken for a wind in his Poncho a shovel and was busy burying the bird in the desert sand. I turned my horse about dog in my spurs. And we got up to way back whence we had come all the way across the desert, all the way back to the eastern seaboard and the theater on the pier. At point punk taleo whether tattered posters, we're still just about legible. The posters that advertised are critically panned performance of the tragedy of Trump draw a battle lone rider and his horse, a horse with no name.

Um, those of you who remember the song, a horse with no name by America, and I'm sure that all of you, it's just one of those songs, isn't it? Everyone knows a horse with no name by America. And America. We're an American band. But I have it on and obviously the song is about the American desert. But I have it on very good authority from my old pal Max desharnais. tractor. A horse with no name by America was recorded in a studio in Willesden. So there you go. Here's something else. Nothing to do with horses. The offering of nifty was a terrible, terrible thing. calamitous according to some. Listen, for example, to what Monsignor pivot had to say, Oh, this is good. I thought I had a tape recording or at least a transcript of that good man's peroration delivered after Nicky was off. But before all the papers were signed and registered and copied and placed on the public notice boards, but where I thought it was in my desk drawer. Now there's only dust dust on the detached leg of a beetle dust on the leg of a beetle and a single paperclip. I find myself wondering about the beetle and the paperclip to the exclusion of cadet nitti. Yes, cadet, for before his offing, he had been stripped of his captaincy. His bad could been crushed and his epaulettes burned. But he went to his offing, with all his arms and legs intact. Unlike the poor Beagle, how had its leg become detached and fetched up in my desk drawer. Where was the rest of the Beatle? Did it live lame, or had it died? And what did the paperclip have to do with anything? Have it clipped together papers which, like the incomplete beetle has since gone missing? Would Monsignor pivot ever deliver a para ration upon the Beagle and the paperclip? Now, of course he wouldn't. He's not that kind of man. And it's not that kind of world. Instead, it's a world where nity has been oft good and proper, never to return. That saddens me Of course it does. But somehow it's not so sad as a main beetle and an abandoned paperclip. I do not set the priorities. I simply feel them and terrible as it is. I know in my bosom that cadet nitti will be forgotten and sooner rather than later, perhaps even before the cows are driven into their buyer for the night. I've said nothing of the dust in the desk drawer. What should I say dust is dust nitti will be dust soon. If the procedures are followed correctly. As I recall in his para ration, Monsignor pivot took pains to stress his hope that they would be it would only add to the tragedy of Nicky's offing if in its aftermath correct procedures were neglected or fact with that can happen sometimes shamefully, though it's nobody's fault. Say it the system and have done with it. At the end of the day, the cows will still be driven into their buyer. Now Mitty is no more on the world or at least a small corner of it is reduced to a Beatles leg and a paperclip. The more one examines them, the more they sing of something, something motley and intangible, as intangible as the Monsignor was the last para ration. Now that I have mislaid, the tape recording and the transcript. I have somewhere some glue. If and when I can find it. I will glue them back of the Beagle to the paperclip. While they're still sticky, I will sprinkled when we dust so that the Dustin hears it is said that the dude abides and likewise the dust adheres. nit he would have known that and perhaps wherever he is, may know it still. I push the desk drawer shot and light my pipe and gaze out of the window that the crows on the lawn. If the crows know anything, they know there will be both the harrowing and a reckoning. My gumboots I'm going to the dormitory of monkeys.

I'd like to begin with a quotation. Many people will have a prejudice against goat's milk, thinking it has a peculiarly goatee flavor. This misapprehension has probably arisen from the experience of tourists in Switzerland and Italy, where goat's milk is in common use and frequently offered in mugs or glasses, which have not been properly cleaned. That's from an article called goalkeeping by HHS Holmes Pegler, which appeared in the listener, volume six Volume One number 16, first of May 1929. That's the kind of thing I read. The engine gave a horse shriek we heard arrived at pin potting or potting pan. The black coaches of the train waited a minute in the silvery light of the mountain, disgorging a miscellaneous collection of people and swallowing others. peppery voices could be heard up and down the platform. Then the weezy engine at the front squeaked again and drew the black chain rattling away into the cavernous tunnel. The broad sweep of country like pure and peaceful once more, with its sharply etched back cloth scoured bright and clean by the damp wind. It was good to breathe the air. I was one of those who would disembark from the train, and I stood waiting on the platform until it was empty but for the guard, who soon vanished into his heart. I had come to this mountain village with my peg leg and my religious hysteria. On the advice even the orders of the family physician in his twinkly, shouting guttural manner, Dr. Garbo insisted that a six month stay in the clean mountain air would restore to me the gusto I had lost. From my part, though I did is he suggested I was unconvinced. My life thus far had been a catalogue of maladies, mishaps and calamities. I had an au shortly after I was born, and then at about three or four years old, I had a grievous au. I've vomited for 12 hours every fortnight for years. This sickness, nipped my strength in the bud. At eight years old, I had an issue in the coronal assuta of my head, which continued running until I was 21. One October I had a violent fever. It was like to have carried me off towards the most dangerous sickness that ever I had. At 15 or 16. I had the measles, but that was nothing. I was hardly sick. I had a dangerous fall from my uncle's horse. The following year, I had smallpox. When I was 20. I had a fall and broke one of my ribs and was afraid it might cause on a posture nation. Much later, coming back from abroad, I was like to be shipwrecked, but no hurt down. The following year, I had a terrible fit of the spleen and piles. Then I received Luiza in testicular which was like to have been fatal. After that my affairs ran kin cam. There was treacheries against me, a couple of years later and in costume broke in my head. Also, I was in danger of being run through with a sword and in danger of being drowned twice. That year, I was in great danger of being killed by a drunkard in the street, but one of his companions hindered his thrust. Now standing on the deserted railway station platform, I mumbled a prayer to several saints, asking them to protect me from further harm. Perhaps Dr. Gobbo was correct.

I set off towards my hotel, a mile or two distant on the banks of the smen. Seldom had I seen a river side teeming with fish. I hope to find upon arrival at the hotel that my room overlooks the river that I might be able to spear fish from the comfort of my balcony. I have brought those Spears with me, but could spend many happy hours whistling sticks gathered in the gorgeous woodland, I would need to obtain some string to attach to my whittled Spears in order to be able to hold them back to the balcony, which I hoped with, I hoped a bream or garden impaled upon them. I was confident from my knowledge of middle European mountain village hotels glean from various encyclopedias. That string would be the sort of item available in a little shop attached to the hotel, much like a church repository. From my perch up on the balcony of my room with string and sticks with Linda spears. I might well be able to provide myself with enough fish for my dinner each day. And that's and that's be spared the ordeal of mucking in with the other guests in the dining room with whom I feared might snigger to my pegleg and be dismissive of my religious hysteria. I knew only too well that Satan can work even in the bosom of the most innocent seeming middle European mountain village hotel guest. These thoughts of succulent and private fish dinners made me peckish as I followed the path along the bank of the smen there was as yet no sign of the hotel. So as I approached a peasant hat, I decided to stop and ask if I might be given a snack. I had not had the opportunity to change my bank draft into the corner of this country, assuming I could do some at the hotel. Last I readied myself to bestow grand and holy Denison's upon the peasant through the power of my voice, and by swinging us by swinging attend center from my unweathered hand. pausing by a clump of Edelweiss I lit the center with my world war one platoon sergeants pump gas lighter, then clunked up through the door of the heart and hammered upon it. The peasant who appeared in answer to my knocking was unafraid to say, an irreligious lout who stank of goat the sacred smoke from my swing center have absolutely no effect upon his morals. As I'm sure you can appreciate, I was thoroughly perplexed at his immunity, and the consequent knotting of my tongue and clogging of my throat, meant that I had much difficulty making myself understood. What ought to have been a simple snack request came out as a strangulated cry of spiritual desolation. To my surprise, however, he gestured for me to follow him into the gloom of his heart. Within all was filth and grease and squalor. Until now, I had harbored a hopelessly romantic view of the lives and habitations of middle European mountain village peasantry base to some extent, upon my musings upon genre john Ruskin's magnificent, yet sadly unwritten study of Swiss towns and villages. I had also watched the sound of music on more than one occasion, which explains why, despite being a botanical ignoramus, I was able correctly to identify the clump of Edelweiss. Next to which I had paused just a moment earlier. The peasant was blundering about in the corner of his disgusting parlor, and now he emerged bearing a beaker of milk. Though he was a sinful man, it was clear he was offering it to me as refreshment. What I wanted was something more substantial, involving pastry and salted fish and black cherries, but I suppose that some solid sweetmeats might follow. So I took the beaker and gulped down the content in one go to show my appreciation. Yuck, I was immediately reminded of those childhood days of fortnightly vomiting. The milk has a peculiarly goatee flavor, which I ascribe to the fact that the beaker in which it came was like everything else in the heart. The peasant included unwashed, it would have been rude of me to

suggest to the peasants that he and his beaker and each of his other appurtenances could benefit from the sponge and soap. So I held my tongue, now thickly coated with milk residue. I still hoped for food, even though whatever I was offered wood, I suppose, the grubby and big grind, but the peasant snatched back the beaker and flail his arms as if shooing me away like one of his goats. I gave the center a dissolve very little swing to waft and sanctity into the mid and gagged on the aftertaste of the goatee milk and backed out of the door, which was immediately slammed shot. I've not even learned the peasants name. I looked up at the mountains. These were the steep snow covered slopes that fictional athlete bob bennett tavole had sprinted up and down for hours at a time, as part of the rigorous training regime devised by his coach, how long in the early years before he won all those medals, peg legs, I could never hope to emulate the spindly. rostral. try as I might. I allowed myself to weep. And then I gathered myself and turned and headed off towards the hotel, and the worst horror of all.

I got a letter in the post today, signed with a flourish by someone who wanted only to be known as processed cheese enthusiastic. Then this The key is said, You are rightly regarded as a fount of all wisdom and unacknowledged authority on just about any subject, one can shake a stick at least that's what I've been told by an acquaintance of mine. Well, not an acquaintance Exactly. rather a fellow I bumped into on a canal towpath when I was out walking my dog it's not a real dog, more of an imaginary one made out of paper, like the adopted children of Arthur Craven and Mina Loy, but by God, it's a faithful hound. Anyway, the point is that I wasn't looking where I was going, and I collided with this chap, who bore a striking resemblance to one of the fingers on the periphery of a piano painted by one of the Renaissance painters, but I can't remember which one. Following our collision, he toppled into the canal. And after I pulled him back onto the path, we fell into conversation. At first, this mainly consisted of recriminations and dark threats of violence. But things soon settle down, and we strolled amicably along, chattering away, like a couple of chattering birds. I'd give you the name of the birds, but I know nothing of Ornithology. Before we parted near a telephone kiosk, the man mentioned out of the blue that you missed a key are rightly regarded as a fount of all wisdom, and an acknowledged authority on just about any subject one can shake a stick at. I wondered for a moment if he had taken leave of his senses. So I rattled off the standard questions. What year is this? What's the current prime minister who is the current prime minister? How much is that doggy in the window, and he seemed kompass mentors. I made a note of your name in my pocket book for future reference. The future has now arrived. When I sprang out of bed this morning, I had a burning question in my head, to which I did not know the answer. As I shoveled my breakfast down my God, I record my encounter with the man on the canal towpath and that he had recommended you as a peerless source of information on everything under the sun. So as soon as I had completed my post breakfast digestive exercises, I rummaged about in the various pockets My various jackets until I found the pocket book in which I had written down your name. Now, you will be a gogue wondering what it is I wish to ask you. Well, Mr. Key, it's this as you know, sorry. As you know everything there is to know, I can safely assume that you're familiar with the laughing cow brand of processed trees triangles, of which I am a great enthusiast. Just in case I've enclosed with this letter, a sample of packaging. You will note that the cow on the laughing cow container is indeed laughing. You will also note that it's not strictly relevant that the cow is sporting a pair of earrings, which unlikely as it seemed a formed of a couple of packets of laughing cow processed trees triangles. That's not something you see every day. Is it? The question that's been raging in my brain since I woke up this morning is this? What is the cow laughing at? I feel sure you will know the answer. Because the man on the canal towpath who were accidentally knocked into the canal told me that you know pretty much everything about everything and willingly share your knowledge with anybody. So please put me out of my misery. And for God's sake enlighten me. What is it that Salamis is the cow? Anyway, that was a lecture I received and I'll be replying privately to processed trees enthusiasts shortly. If any other listeners have queries about cow related matters, or indeed cow unrelated matters, please feel free to drop me a line.

Finally for 2015 as ever, I'll end with a plug for Mr. Keys, shorter, potted brief, brief lives, a wonderful collection of over 500 potted biographies. And this week, I'll leave you with Dre Henry Mowbray, an American writer of the 20th century, who was the author of a book published in 1912. And I will give you the full title of that book. sinking of the Titanic most appalling ocean horror, with graphic descriptions of hundreds swept to eternity beneath the waves, panic stricken multitude facing shore death and thrilling stories of this most overwhelming catastrophe to which is added vivid accounts of heart rending scenes when hundreds were doomed to watery grave compiled from soul sir at stirring stories told by eyewitnesses of this terrible horror of the briny deep. Give books titles like that anymore, and I think they should, I think my next book, I think we'll have a title with a longer than that. And maybe it'll take the entire show to read it out to you. I'll go now and leave you with Henry Ervin and thank john Fey's Sterling work behind the behind the behind the behind the faders Yeah, bye
