As we recall some of the enticing act, who appeared at the bodgers spinny variety theater during its golden age. Not be Park, the human wind sock. Bells claimed whenever Nabil Park appeared on stage for 10 awful days in the summer of 1907. He was held incommunicado by a gang of papacy fanatics. He escaped by means of a clever poison gas device, which he kept tucked inside his vest and made his way back to Badr Spinney, just in time to do his wind sock act at the annual Chambery maybe cron log and her trailing bandage.

The affair was never satisfactorily resolved. More's the pity. magnet boy the boy magnet. magnet boy. The boy magnet was the brainchild of one Horst preen a disheveled tugboat Captain from tantaran them on a birthday frolic in a disused, Fun Factory. He caught by chance discovered a matchless talent for disguise and physical agility. Apart from the famous magnet boy, the boy magnet act, he throws two continents with his wonderful ability to kill himself up into a ball and bounce across wide canals. The highly infectious Renshaw family, the highly infectious wrench or family were fond of butter, crocus's and financially was astonishingly hard hearted.

For one thing, he had a wood nose following a youthful pole vaulting accident. He kept his nose carefully varnished, and at nightfall, he placed it in a little titanium jar at his bedside. His Tea strainers wrote a skim Childers drove me crackers. Ingmar and Hetty, the burst appendix twins.

Ingmar and Hattie, who were not actually twins and whose real names were in Matt Baskerville and magnesium flower dewdrop hailed from a small island in the North Sea, from which they were expelled for reasons are known, adept at plunging metal objects into basins of salt water. They were killed in 1924 while picnicking near ostriches.

He was taken to the top of a big, shiny plastic and tin attended hovercraft, like Helter Skelter had his library ticket removed from the pocket of his tunic, and was pushed by his parents down the spiraling vortex of the ride halfway down which he was yanked by the scruff of his neck up into the illimitable heavens by an agency unknown and unthinkable, only to be deposited four hours later, on top of the belfry tower at the great Cathedral of St frac in the piping hot town of act on the vog. Captain snap the cheery bird straggler. Captain snap was a proper caution plagued by a chesty, cough wit, lows and varicose veins. It was nevertheless the finest bird strangler of his generation. within his bailiwick, he adopted an air of unflappability. At his command, little children would happily to their conquerors and polish their hat. EDS o Shaughnessy, the woman with the small plasticine badger was eds. O.

Because quite simply, he tapped a deep vein of what the tongue decides to call tongue. That's why

those 12 pin port traits of a variety theatre act. We're a company we're originally a company by 12 black and white drawings. And they appeared I think, almost 20 years ago, in the hooting yard calendar fact more than 20 years ago. I think that was the hooting yard calendar for 1993. Any of you lucky enough to own such a wonderful thing should be pleased With yourselves. I think there were only 50 or 100 copies ever made. And it retailed for a fiver as far as I can recall. Yes, they were putting out calendars in 1992 9394 and 1997. And there hasn't been one sense. Anyway, yes. So I thought I'd read those read those 12 little potted biographies. And if you'd like to read them again, they will be in tomorrow's edition of the dabbler which is the dabbler.co.uk online, and every Friday, there's a feature called keys cupboard, which contains every week something or other by me. This, on the other hand, has not appeared in the dabbler. Everyone has their favorite type of duck, and for prudence foxglove it was the bufflehead in the summer of 1894, the unsung Victorian dreaminess took a break from writing her daring Lee modernist plays, and compiled a fat volume in titled a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and song. It was illustrated where with her own cack handed pencil drawings, which has to be said, look much more like teal or mergansers than buffleheads. The dramatist had thousands of copies of the book printed at her own expense, a cost she could easily afford, after the astonishing success of her plays, such as see how the intoxicated Bruce wallows in a swamp of moral turpitude until his ravaged soul is uplifted by muscular Christianity in the person who have a pugilist Vica 1894 the closing scene in that fine play, in which the Reverend Nabil Attenborough rains, his boxing gloved fist down upon the head of the intoxicated brute, is unforgettable. prudence foxglove had been collecting snippets about buffleheads from books, periodicals and food packaging since childhood. Most girls of that era would have pasted their cuttings into a scrapbook, but prudence disliked both taste and scrapbooks. And instead, she stuffed her snipping into an ever burgeoning accumulation of burlap Gunny sacks. When a sack was plump and full, she stitched it up using exemplary needle work skills, and then trusted it to the keeping of one of her many gardeners for use as a pillow. The Fox glove family estate have extensive grounds grown wild over generations of neglect, and it was prudent his mother hepzibah improbably green fingered, who determined to tame them, employing hundreds of snaggletooth peasants from the surrounding hovels, to dig and prune and hoe and Harrow. under the spell of the social reformer, Rufus cranked hepzibah foxglove built on model village gardeners to live in each of their own hut with guttering and drainage on a spigot and a sink, and a pallet with a mattress and a shelf of improving cracks and prayer books and a picture nailed to the wall of Christ commanding the woman to throw the sack full of beetles and locusts and flies and snakes and Hornets and wasps into the sea. It was unusual in those days for gardeners and other servants to have pillows. So, prudence is Gunny sacks were particularly welcome. At her mother's insistence, she had taken the precaution of seeking approval from Rufus crank himself.

By then over 90, the reformer wrote back to her in the famous pillows for gardeners letter, in which he laid out a set of principles we would do well to abide by today. If that is we still had gardeners in hearts in the grounds of our estate. Be warned, he wrote that a gardener plucked from his hovel and given a heart with modern appurtenances, such as a sink and a spigot may get hoity toity, if allowed to rest is oddly shaped head on a pillow. Yet krisztian compassion tells us he must be given the chance to do so. The risk of hoity toity pianists can be tempered, if not wholly eradicated, by observing some general principles, rent the pillow to your gardener, rather than giving it to him outright. stuff it not with Kpop nor duck feathers nor soft downy and padman but with gravel or pebbles or sand, paper and cardboard cuttings on the subject of bufflehead are an acceptable stuffing in extremists. Use burlap Gunny sacks or other rough fabric forbid pillowcases. Young prudence got herself into a tizzy when trying to decide how to charge the gardener's for pillow rental. For they were unfamiliar with coinage being peasants. Then one of her mother's regular soirees, she met the so called potato economist Hicks, an extraordinary man whose theories ought to have resounded down the ages, but did not possibly because he expounded them in prose so dense and cluttered and awash with spelling errors than it was and still is mistaken for gibberish. When he spoke, however, Hicks was a model of clarity. And as he stood next to a blazing half at the soiree, his massive Victorian beard at risk of catching fire. He told prudence to accept payment of pelo rent in potatoes. It was advice she took to heart so much so that As the years passed, and she grew to adulthood, and found worldly success as a playwright, spill she found time each week to Potter from heart to heart, in the grounds of the state of which she was now the mistress, demanding and receiving a potato from each of the increasingly creaky gardeners, who at night rested their heads on pillows stuffed with her collection of bufflehead clippings. Many of these potatoes were destined for the grubby lodgings, where Hicks moved in penury. Every Thursday morning, prudence foxglove and parcel the potato of took a horse and cart down to the village post office, where a new fangled pneumatic funnel system sent packages whizzing across the land. What Hicks did with all these potatoes, is an enduring mystery phase diary is, if anything even less comprehensible than his published writings. At one point, it was thought a small clue was to be found in the startlingly fat book Table Talk of bearded Victorian intellectuals. Were in Nestle the report of a figure thought to be Hicks standing next to a blazing half, making canny observations upon the dietary habits of impecunious bearded Victorian intellectuals in which the potato features prominently. But Hicks famously viewed the potato as a currency, and he is unlikely ever to have eaten one. He was in any case, an unrepentant carnivore, having trained his stomach to digest liver and gravy in huge quantities, as recommended by the nutritionist Bristow another bearded Victorian intellectual, but one who had never so far as we know, been invited to one of hepes about foxgloves soirees

after her mother was killed as a result of a cartographic mishap. prudence foxglove, first continued with the soirees Hicks, Jetsam Baxter, cough drop fig and fig be what all regular visitors trudging across the filthy fields to the estate in all weathers, keen to propound, their various nostrums and being plied with hibiscus syrup, and water biscuits, while prudence is sister Drusilla tinkled sentimental songs at the piano. Crew said his repertoire was small, but she compensated for it by devising hectic improvisational passages, so that a mournful dirge such as bring me your winding sheet, or mother of mine, which lasts about two minutes when played straight, could last up to 16 or 17 hours, by which time the assorted bearded Victorian intellectuals had often become so argumentative. That shouting and fisticuffs were not uncommon. Prince's drudge complained about forever having to mop up blood stains from the rug adjacent to the blazing hot blazing hearth, and threatened to seek drudgery elsewhere. petrified of losing so tireless or mapa prudence decided to call a halt to the soirees. This left Drusilla a total loose end until she was persuaded to transcribe her piano pieces for a chorus of voices. And on their afternoons off, she trained and rehearsed the gardener's leading them on loud and lusty sing songs roaming across the fields and hills, and alarming cows and pigs and ponies. Without a drawing room full of pontificating, bearded Victorian intellectuals, prudence foxglove, to buy have found herself in won't have anything to occupy her. But instead, she relished the solitude and took her first faltering steps towards writing. The plays which would make her rich and famous lay in the future, and her early efforts were inverse and prose. She tried her hand at detective stories, ballads, nonfiction, a history of eggs, and a pistol array and a pistol literary novel and automatic writing dictated from the spirit world. For that matter, she had her arm hoist. She had her arm hoist, in a canvas sling, her hand grasping a steel pen, and stunned herself with laudanum. Publishers rejected everything she sent to them. With the single exception of the magazine mawkish chaff, which accepted her poem, the hopeless hollyhocks. Her excitement was somewhat dimmed when it turned out that the editor was a hicksite and paid for her poem in potatoes. Nevertheless, inspired by her appearance in the public prints, or be it in a magazine with a tiny circulation, prudence fired off a series of similar pieces, including the Magoo Bria salute pins, the dismal diaries and a spinny choked with Marsh land weeds, and impress the editor with her industry. He invited her to visit his office in a grim northern mill town, and so it was that prudent found herself taking her first ever railway journey. The trip itself was an eventful, but not so her arrival at the grim northern Milltown railway station, the editor of mawkish craft came to meet her in person. It was a dashing CAD with exquisite manners and the morals of the sewer, and actually disembarked from her train. He swept her into his arms, protested his undying passion for her cross the platform to bundle her onto a small branch line train and carried her away with him to a boarding house in a shabby seaside resort for a week of sinful debauch.

Initially smitten prudence soon came to her senses, on the pretext of popping out of the boarding house to buy a couple of truck ices from the seafront kiosk. She went straight to the police station, and shocked us to do sir, as the CAD was carted off to clink by a team of roses. She took the train back to the grim northern Milltown let herself into the offices of mawkish craft, with a key she had secretly had cut and set about running the magazine herself. prudence foxglove proved to be an edit tricks of genius. Pages once filled with sentimental pap now played host to extraordinary talents, as she called on all those bearded Victorian intellectuals, or attended the soirees to penned essays and manifestos and epic poems, and novellas, and vision, rebirth Billings, and occasionally automatic writing dictated from the spirit world while their arms were hoisting Canvas slings. Hicks himself was given three entire issues to expand his theories of potato economics, and then a further three when he decided he's not quite finished, followed by a couple of supplementary issues to tie up a few loose ends, and a Christmas special to repeat the more pertinent point. prudence was the first to publish both figs, hallucinate re ravings, and fig bees tweet nature notes. It was in mawkish craft that cough drop predicted In the coming century, the appearance upon the world stage of a pamphleteer he mistakenly identified as bahnsen. Throughout this blizzard of editorial activity, prudence continued to cut out clippings about buffleheads and to send them to Drusilla, who had been charged with stuffing them into a burlap gunny sack and collecting the pillow rent from the gardeners. Is it curious that not a single cutting was ever taken from prudent his own magazine, one can search through the bound volumes, and never once find the word bufflehead. Whereas the names of other types of ducks turn up frequently. Particularly Sheldrake, which were an obsessional interest of Baxter's no matter what he was meant to be writing about. And I'm not sure I have time to finish reading this story, which is actually longer than I had thought it was. We've only got about four minutes left or three, if we include time for me hand over to the next show. So I'm not going to carry on and I will continue to, to the end of that story. In next week's show, I hope you've been enjoying it. It's entitled a celebration of the bufflehead in prison song. And that's what you've got to look forward to next week, sometimes I do these overlaps, it's a good incentive for you to tune in, turn on and drop out next week. And it's also a good reminder to me, I don't have to think about what I'm going to start the show with. But you don't want to hear about the complicated code rotations which take place in Mr. Keys head as he prepares valiantly each show with which to entertain you. Or perhaps you do I don't know. Maybe I should write about that. How I get into the zone to Well, I say record of course the show goes out live. So don't record it. Come up with I mean, I am reading. I've never gone through a show making everything up as I go along. That might be interesting to do that one day. Maybe I will come unprepared. And just babble. I'll just Babble Babble Babble Babble. And you know what, you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. But that's it for this week. It's hot. Bye bye.
