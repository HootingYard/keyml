Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air now in its 13th year of broadcasting even longer ago than the first hooting out on the air show was the malice of forethought press, which was a 20th century press. run by me and Max desharnais. And I was rummaging among loads of old stuff the other day, when I came upon a mint condition copy of Tales of Hoon, and tales of Hoon, as it says on the, on the on the copyright page is copyright Frankie 1987. This is a limited first edition of 25 copies, numbered and signed by the author. This is number three. And it's a tales of Hoon, which on the title page says, crumpled yams by Frank key with three maps and an exciting diagram. And there are four stories in here, tales of Hoon, and at the back. There's a fantastic a, a far three, a three fold out diagram handcoloured. And it actually contains a piece of sandpaper. It's a fantastic thing. The dot that the diagram found its way into the paperback, twitching and shattered two years later. But this is the original and colored copy. So amazing. And it's a great little booklet. Even though I say so myself, it's kind of weird for me to look at it and think this is something I did in my 20s it's a very long time ago, 29 years ago to be precise. I mean, why I thought I thought I might sell it on eBay, but if anyone's listening and we'd like to offer me a price for a mint, signed, hand colored hand sandpapered with gold, golden golden lettering on the cover. Yeah, if anyone would like to offer me some money for it, I'll send it to them. But meanwhile, I could read you a tale of Hoon, and this is the ascent of the mountain at hoon. There were 400 of us. Last carried the water in a shallow basin, spilling a small quantity of our vital supply. Each time he stumbled over conceal heaps of bauxite, and other points of geological interest. Helga was able to top up the basin by melting patches of snow with a Bunsen burner. But there was very little snow on the lower slopes, and what there was had inevitably been shat on by hogs will the beast geese and backed by the second day, laws had managed not only to spill the entire water supply, but it also cracked the basin in half by accidentally banging it against a rogue shard of bazel. The rest of us were furious. Venables wanted to hold us over a precipice, Van gob brandished his rifle in a menacing fashion, muttering low threat. Laws merely soaked, squatting, and the Bracken and whittling away at a small piece of wood, which he had painted Crimson some years earlier. The tension mounted

then hosts discovered some strange blueish flecks in a piece of rock. gritting his teeth, he set about it with his iron hammers. And we were astonished to watch incandescent liquids but fourth, forming a miraculous arc over the ramshackle encampments of pitched tents we called home. Grab was the first drink the liquid phase thirst was the stuff of legend. collected some in a battered tin cup and drank it at a gulp. moment later, just as we were lighting a bonfire, his eyes glazed over and he stamped his feet in a demented rhythm. He began to speak in a loud declamatory manner. He said, I have seen read shelves stacked with 1000 corks. The corks have teeth marks in them, as if they had been ignored by a billy goat or other beast of the field. Then and only then, a vision of mud. I have listened to the sounds made by chaffinches and walked 100 miles in driving rain, burning clay until it explodes, tying endless knots in brown Canvas flags. My breath is the breath of a man who has the gift of tongues, a man who has spoken with corncrakes gemstones have IFA ears and potty for a hat wrapped me in chrysanthemums inveigle me with truncated Proverbs, I shall not hear, for I hear only the clanking of broken church bells, sets, swinging high and towers, when the air is still from the sky has vanished. I say to you, that I am as of act that which has a luminosity no not under you, nor shall it ever be known unto you, for you also the eyes and ears of pebbles lying scattered on the ocean floor. I have a lavish view with ice and wood and AK. And now I must be gone from your site farewell. So saying glob marched away up hill towards the summit. He did not look back. We never saw him again. The next morning last was detailed to return to the sordid village at the foot of the mountain to get a new supply of water and a new basin in which to carry it. Lips attempt to glue the cracked basin back into one piece had met with dismal failure, waving farewell to laws and leaving rip to extricate his left arm from a narrow vertical crevice in the mountainside. We pressed on browband took photographs of us along various stages of the climb. I treasure particularly one of Helga making final adjustments to her snorkeling equipment before diving to the bottom of the imaginary lake of Hoon, which has enticed so many earlier pilgrims on this route. The photograph outdoors I think the one shown on a commercial postcard issued by me and CO in 18 x x browband himself was heroic, urging us onward whenever we became this consonant or morose. He lavished us with biscuits made to his own highly secret recipe. They tasted of chalk yet had a nutritional value that came to certain root vegetables on the eighth day, while the rest of us slept browband shaved off his massive walrus mustache. When we awoke, not one of us recognized him charming drapes like this capitas cheerful. It was only on the 11th day that we became worried about laws, who would still not rejoin the party, Venables Piccolo and kazoo ball volunteered to go back and search for him before they left father Todd Crawford mass lips refusal of the communion wafer caused a stir until we were distracted by a thunderclap and the rains began. Were sheltered under the limestone outcrop, which seemed worrying the crumbly Van gobert did Sterling work shoring it up with zinc and titanium rods which he carried in his rucksack for just such an emergency. The only sour note occurred when Dennis spotting a lame horse through his 10 telescope foolishly left the shelter in order to parlay with it.

He was immediately struck by lightning and incinerated, the horse will lead and limped away out of sight. Some days later, the rains at last stopped delaying our need to bury what was left of Dennis. We made rapid progress towards the summit. Cannon Kanan is Vanna carried my wheelchair over ravines and galleys. At the bottom of one of which I noticed an enormous pile of cutlery. I was puzzled for rust had not yet stricken it either it had been deposited very recently, perhaps by our missing colleague glob, or the air this high up had restless properties. I was intrigued. Over the next few days I filled over a dozen notebooks with arcane and fearsome calculations. I measured the angle of the sun rays as they struck barely visible veins of bitumen in the rock face. Using my blunt vane stroke clock, I've timed the cracking of dry seal eyes. I reduce the editing of the Marist breeze to a universally applicable algebraic equation, nonsensical to all but myself. Yet I was unable to reach a definitive conclusion. This question of restlessness we'll have to wait until our expedition is over. When I can spend long hours in the great libraries of the world poring over obscured gibberish. As we climbed higher, a yellow foul smelling mist descended, and its flask fell victim to corrosion on the 14th day broadbands head took on the appearance of a singularly repulsive turnip. It was he who announced that we had not brought enough oxygen 10th I began to knit furiously, doling out scarves, balaclavas and wooly leggings to the company as fast as I was able, but we all realize that things could not continue for much longer without a radical reappraisal. When we estimated that we were four days from the summit, we gathered in strawbs big tent for a meeting. Templates were frayed and minis attempts to draw us along by singing selections from light opera, but only with venomous irritation, with crude what was left of the pickle supply and tried to iron out a strategy. After some aimless discussions, Venables announced that he had carried out an inventory a deranged gleam in his eyes, he said, I have divided the inventory into three distinct categories as follows. Category A supplies we have exhausted, Category B supplies, which we will doubtless exhaust in the next day or two, and category c supplies of which we have a huge and unwarranted surplus. My inventory gives the following results a, asbestos bales, crimping irons, doilies, electric shoes, febrifuge, gray bags and hailstone, repellent, B IP, Gumball coal and large s. c. Mark nose cones, operating tables, pole vaulting equipment, questions, rosary beads, starch, talc urns, varnish whisks expropriated, honey, Yesh, Max and dissolve. You will look rather surprised. I don't know I don't blame you. It will be true to say that we have not been sensible of our peril. We cannot. He was interrupted by a commotion at the entrance flap. We all look round and was startled to see last heavily bearded broken sunglasses hanging off one year struggling into the tent. He was carrying a giant roll of sail cloth which appeared to be threaded with gold. ashen faced, Lars lurched to the podium and began to speak. We could hardly hear him, but he was close to death, and his words were near gasps. It was only later that I realized that he was revealing to us the knowledge he had hidden all along, thus consigning us to almost certain death on the icy mountain. Why had he not told us before? as it was, none of us caught his meaning at the time, we heard only inarticulate wheezing, which we dismissed as the ravings of a dying imbecile had we paid attention, things might have ended differently.

Frank Key  14:29
We buried laws in a shallow grave and proceeded to unroll the sail cloth. The thread was indeed spun of gold, but if the cloth was any other had any other significance It was not apparent. Using Helga as a scimitar we cut it into sections to make hoods, blanket bandages and turn a case. The next day before continuing boldly on Kerwin Callen tossed to a wrestling match. A rivalry had been brewing between them for the past week, occasioned by a brouhaha over pythons were gathered about them forming two groups of opposing. The manuscript breaks off at this point, we are indebted to Professor wildomar known for this translation from the original Hungarian. Unlike earlier translators, Professor nog had access to the actual woodblocks, on which the narrator carved his journal. It is now over 40 years since the discovery of the woodblocks encased in ice and wrapped in sail cloth wedged in a crevasse halfway up the mountain at hoon. The site of the discovery has led some commentators to suggest that the expedition did reach the summit, and that the party was on its way down before it vanished without trace. Professor nog, having thoroughly examined this theory remains convinced that the campuses and altimeters were askew all along, and that the expedition never got anywhere near the summit. The case of glob is a separate issue, and has not yet been fully researched. Although Professor nog hopes to shed new light on the matter next year, when his secondment to a polar station in Greenland comes to an end. It should be noted that the woodblocks mentioned above now reside in the blank Museum, where they're guarded by a surly curator named mango. Gifts of raw meat and insect repellent are likely to melt mangoes formidable countenance should one wish to examine the woodblocks at leisure.

Let's have another title of who'd funny to think that I was writing there about something that happened 40 years ago, and it's nearly 30 years since I wrote about it. Sorry, it's now gonna be 70 years since whatever happened 40 years ago happened. This is the second title of whom this one is called an anecdote about the baton. Now let's try that again. This is hooting yelled on the air. I am reading to you from a 29 year old out of print pamphlet called tales of Hoon, and this is a second tale of Hoon and it's called an anecdote about the botanical garden at home. Ruthin sucks that piece of coal thoughtfully. He would have to be careful, spitting out the coal. He untied the cement block from his ankle and bobbed to the surface. It was just as he thought. Looking about him. He realized that yet again, he was in the fountain pond of the Botanical Gardens, easing himself out of the water. He stood for a moment on the gritty path, before heading off towards this brightly clump of Aspen's some yards ahead. In the midst of the trees, lying scattered on the ground, he found his clothing, a vast pink towel, a battery operated hairdryer, and a thermos flask, rapidly drying and dressing. He opened the flask and Swigged its content, some sort of an identifiable high in alcohol, and with an admirable warming quality. shriveled up at the bottom of the flask soaked in the booze by a shred of cotton, gossamer thin, and seemingly stuck fast inside. rufen attended the flask and whacked its base with the flat of his hand, but he was unable to dislodge the fabric. Then he noticed a long tin fork lying on the ground nearby, poking about with this he extracted the cloth and unfolding it was able to read the message he suspected he would find printed upon it. Good Morrow, we do apologize that we have had to submerge you in the pond yet again. How many times is it now? 12. Rest assured, it won't happen again. I know we said that last time, but this time we promise. Definitely never again. Sorry about the lump of coal. That was a mistake. The message printed in 12 point, Baskerville was unsigned rufen bunched up the fabric in his fist and replaced it in the flask. At least this time, he, at least this time as a misprint, at least this time had been left on his own clothing. It should be he had been left on his own clothing. The first time, all he had found was a fireman's helmet and a Jesuit su time. on subsequent occasions, he had been left either similarly ridiculous combinations, or only selected items of his own, stuffing the flask into his pocket, but abandoning the hairdryer where it lay, he stumbled out of the Aspen clump and headed towards the fountain pond, circling it with huge strides, gazing straight ahead, he waited for the sound of distant church bells. before going any further, he was disturbed to note that the breast pocket of his jacket had been coated with tar. His Sonata for bassoon sincerity cipher and walkie talkie was nearly finished. He was happy with the first eight seconds of the final movement, I don't know and had only three more seconds to go. According to the schema he had grown up two decades previously. This schema took the form of a gigantic chart, or map pinned up in his attic. The devilishly complex color coding was beginning to fade and the paper itself with yellowing and curling around the edges. The basic idea was that each of the Sonata is 4000 movements, acted as a musical representation of a square yard of hoon. Editing his ideas down to 11 second burst was the difficult part. And some movements have given him more trouble than others, piecing together a coherent sound assemblage to represent the westernmost corner of hooting yard and almost broken his health.

It had taken him 18 months. It has taken him 18 months with stops and starts, including six weeks in a rather disgusting sanatorium. Until now, he thought that had been the most nightmarish period. But ever since he had embarked upon this last movement. Based upon the fountain pond in the Botanical Gardens, things have taken a very sinister turn. Suddenly, at this crucial stage, his work was being sabotaged. That night, once he was safely tucked up in bed, roof and attached a set of electrodes to his mosquito net, if any maligned finger wanted to enter bathroom unconscious, and immerse him in a pond three miles away, if I would do so, only at the risk of receiving a massive electric shock rufen pleased so cunning a defense mechanism tackle hideously before falling asleep. Two hours later, without waking, he died. ruffians personal physician, Dr. Park no lip walked up the head of the funeral cortege, sobbing into his upturned hat. In shaking hands, he cradled the grimy sour Westar filled with blossoms to be sprinkled over the grave. For the first time in his career, Dr. Park no lip had been unable to diagnose the cause of death. His patient appeared to have simply conked out, casting his crawl as wide as possible. The famous surgeon contacted a network of medical experts in and around Hoon, all of whom expressed equal puzzlement. But Wiley Karna pronounced an open verdict. Ruth Finn's death remained a mystery. He was interred in the hangman's garden section of the cemetery. The unfinished Sonata rearranged for xylophones on Martino and plastic bags received its first public performance on the 10th anniversary of Ruth Flynn's death. The score had been pieced together by the composer's nice taking a break from our own work as a bandage designer. The concept tent pitched perhaps ironically, in the Botanical Gardens was packed out It seemed that all of whom was there. In a review written for the who lanten critic transom purge wrote refunds last unfinished work is by turns agonizing these Estoril boisterously yearning cantankerous Li czar office damn plea wins Some extremely vainglorious ferociously unnecessary. durably truncated hermetically Savage ignobly rapacious jarringly quaint. kaleidoscopically palpable lewdly otiose murderously numinous numbingly magnificent, ugly blank, possibly not need quietly jubaland rustaveli imponderable sordid, Lehigh erratic, tremendously grating, unimaginably fierce, valiantly emblematic. woodenly, dreadful xeno, glossy, ugly crumpled, youthfully bumptious and zealous and zealously arresting. And yet it is more than this. It is perhaps that most precious of things, the musical equivalent of a particularly demented firing squad, aiming with cack handed Glee at everything accepted target. Dr. Park no lip died of the plague The day after the concert, and was buried next is patient and power, the composer. His tractor, volleyball net and rhinoplasty diagrams were buried with him. A public subscription was organized to be administered by Ruth Evans nice and Dr. Park no lip gambling cronies, in order to erect a suitable monument to these two worthies of Hoon, some 14 years after the doctor's demise. A lavish monstrosity constructed out of twigs, crampons, dubbin and bays, was unveiled in the Botanical Gardens sited between the fountain con and the clump of Aspen's an inscription was thought unnecessary.

So that was two tales of Hoon, the ascent of the mountain at Hoon, and an anecdote about the botanical gardens at Hoon, and next week, I'll read to you the other two tales, which are a lecture delivered in the big tent at home and massacre of the innocence at hoon. And in addition to the text and the maps, and the big foldout diagram, this this little pamphlet, tiles of home contains on page 35, which is the penultimate page, an index of characters to be found in the stories. I won't read the page numbers, but I can give you a list of all the characters you'll find. So they'll be the characters you've heard of, in the two stories I've read. And also the characters who will appear in the two stories. I shall read next week. And they are in alphabetical order by surname. Ned vials Helga big.
