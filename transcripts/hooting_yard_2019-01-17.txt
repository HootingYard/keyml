Boy. This is the golden half hour of decrepitude, otherwise known as hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And I'll be joined this week by pansy cradle drew again. So that's a little treat for you all. The first show of 2019 in a few months time we will celebrate this one still on air. We'll celebrate the 15th anniversary of hooting yard on the air. have to think of some way of celebrating anyway, like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, I know the misery of being inconvenienced by a person from poor luck. It happened Thus, it was a Wednesday I recall, teeming with hooting yards most tremendous rainfall for 40 years. I was sat at the kitchen table, attempting to insert a new pair of laces into my gleaming big black rubber boots. Many was at her spinet as usual. idli tinkling, I suspected that soon the tinkling would cease and she would launch into an impassioned performance of run of her 10,022 songs. I hope she would play my favorite the anthem for a brutish haberdasher or perhaps, mangled sea chantey bring me your winding feet over Mother of mine. As I fiddled ineptly with the laces, our door crashed open, and a hirsute and drenched individual burst into the room. In an instant, a puddle formed at his feet. Many continued to tinkle I come, announced the stranger in the telemetry roar, as if he were addressing a vast crowd of huddled petitioners. I come not from haunts of coot and Hearn, nor do I come in response to your whistle my lad. I was not whistling, I replied. Precisely, he continued. I come from poor luck, and I'm going to confiscate your aglets so saying he withdrew from the pocket of his bright yellow wind treater, a pair of garden sequiturs, swiftly cut the aglets off the ends of my brand new laces, and charged out into the downpour. He did not close the door behind him. I held my head in my hands and began to weep, merely played the pounding, opening chords of dismal corncrakes.

Frederica segars entertainments for home, church and school. 1914 is packed with unbearably exciting diversions. Here, for example, is lighting the candle. This feat is a very amusing one, and is performed as follows. Two persons kneel on the ground facing each other. He holds in his left hand, a candle in a candlestick at the same time, grasping his right foot in his right hand. This position compels him to balance himself on his left knee. One of the candles is lighted, the other is not. The holders are required to light to the unlighted candle from the lighted one. The conditions are simple enough, but one would hardly believe how often the performers will roll over on the floor before they succeed in lighting the candle. It will be found desirable to spread a newspaper on the floor between the combatants. Maybe spots of candle grease will thus be intercepted and the peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately spared

Frank Key  05:05
I myself have noticed through long experience that only ladies in houses worry about candle grease on floors. It men just don't even notice it. Interesting that before we move on with something from pansy cradle Joe, I just like to read you a quotation from lm Belloc, who wrote upon another occasion, I went to a little Norman, the market town up among the hills. were one of the smallest squares was called the place of the three mad nuns. Are you a mad nun pansy?

Unknown Speaker  05:50
Not that I'm aware of. Are you a mad nun?

Frank Key  05:55
Only only in me in my dreams?

Unknown Speaker  06:02
Well, for those of you who like me have always been curious. This is how to get to hooting yard. Turn around, head for the door. Turn left past the baths, the chemist shop, the town hall, the pigeon loss and the owl sanctuary. Along blister lane. Go right at the duck pond. Then up Pang Hill until you reach the gasworks now strike off down amnesiac lane towards the graveyard. Hop over the fences and head west to Barger. spinny. Dip your cup in the stream and rest while make your way to the mysterious village where the dandelions are blue and the air is thick with a stench of vinegar. dither in the square until you spot the newspaper kiosk, or you will be able to buy a gadgeteer of the village and its hinterland. study this carefully whisk yourself along the towpath of the canal and cross it at sawdust bridge following there after the course of the great frightening river campout on the Knoll and eat up your sausages. There are many butterflies to be seen there. Do not net them. hair up on past the big fireworks factory and the dental Institute. You will notice that the crossbar is missing from the tee. So it reads the denial Institute until you find yourself in the thicket of nettles for yourself with the aid of secretaries, then you must catch the funicular way away up to the very top of pill garlic tour and hurry down the other side on foot splashing through puddles until you reach the infected pig farmers house. Hide in his orchard and snooze. Now stride with Giant Steps across the fields of barley, turnips, Bracken and first Yes, Bracken and Bracken and furs, and Javelin, we'd passed the abandoned quarry and on through a knot of allotments finding shelter in a hut empty but for the rusted remnants of a lawnmower, the skull of a badger and a smashed and unreadable instruction manual for a pencil sharpener. As the sun rises trudge south, skirting the shabby limekilns and the serried Belvedere is of hemoglobin towers, until you hit upon an astonishing tract of rhubarb fields. At the far end of which, nestled behind beside the alleyway leading off to Plunkett Hall, you will find hooting yard where you will be made most welcome.

Frank Key  09:22
Could I just ask you a question about what you've just read, please?

Unknown Speaker  09:26
Yes.

Frank Key  09:27
Well, you talked about an infected pig farmers hop?

Unknown Speaker  09:31
Yes.

Frank Key  09:32
Was it which is infected the pig or the pig farmer?

Unknown Speaker  09:39
That is unclear.

Frank Key  09:41
Or is it an infected pig? farmer a farmer of infected pigs or is it a pig farmer who's infected?

Unknown Speaker  09:53
I don't know. But we are approaching the beginning of the year of the pig. I will maybe we'll know then.

Frank Key  10:00
Sorry john it could be the heart It

Unknown Speaker  10:05

Frank Key  10:16

Unknown Speaker  10:19
or some combination thereof.

Frank Key  10:23

Frank Key  11:11
Here is a sad story. And there was a man named durveys bird lip resident at that time they knew Takata he hailed originally from Helsinki, or Helsing force, where his parents used to polish shields with old rags. Bird had lived for many years birdly How? Sorry. Bird lip, had for many years lived in a caravan on the outskirts of Helsinki, or Helsing fours. It was a dilapidated caravan. Nobody knew why he had moved to you toxic. Nobody knew whether or not his papers were in order. Nobody knew for how many years he'd been alive on this terrifying and miraculous planet. Nobody knew why his teapot leaked. Nobody knew why his left shoulder blade was emblazoned with a magnificent tattoo of a cormorant. Nobody knew why his death build was so preposterous. Nobody knew that he was ashamed of his clubfoot. Nobody knew that he sculpt about in the orchard. Nobody knew what he tapped in that mysterious iron pail. Nobody knew the angle of his hat. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. If it's a sad story.

The windows in the villa, the Wind in the Willows, the windows. I'll start again. The windows in the Vela The Wind in the Willows. The wind in the windows, the will in the windows, the wills in the window goop. The executor saw that the will had been lodged in the casement window.

Now Captain cake had gone to seed. He looked as if he had been cursed by some bright fanged as tech God. I think it might be called abraxis. Either that or Myrna Loy, whose face loomed huge when he had shut his eyes racked by palsy, His hands were withered and all his timbers had been shivered.

Frank Key  19:49
Before I forget, I know that we're kind of two weeks or so into the new year. But as I wasn't here last week, this is the first hooting yard of the new year which leads me to give you two quotations about the new year, which I'm very fond of. The first is from Arthur Rambo's mother. In a letter to her daughter in 1906. My dad, Madame Rambo wrote, I am not writing to wish you a good New Year. It's futile actions are everything. And perhaps even better than that is Peter Hitchens. Famous remark from about 10 or so years ago. I am actively hostile to the new year, which I think is a splendid attitude to take.

Unknown Speaker  21:16
Watching pigs scrabbling around is thought to be a splendid cure for melancholy. Although it is not mentioned in Burton's anatomy. Perhaps the effectiveness of this as a cure lies in Robert Wyatt's observation that barnyard animals don't follow a career plan. R is for reader. Most writers, I think, have an image of their ideal reader. I'd like to introduce you to mine. I call him Mr. Katie after his wife. He is very tall, looks not unlike an old sea dog. And when he stands to speak, he sways alarmingly, as if lashed to his mast in a Maelstrom. His speech is incoherent. And while I listen to him, I hold my hand over my paper cup to stop him, spitting crumbs into my glutinous pear juice, while my gaze is transfixed by the piece of greenery, lettuce, spinach on his upper lip. Perhaps he is telling me all about the freudenstein crate. Which begs the question, Mr. K, what listener Do you envisage when you read hooting your heart

Frank Key  22:36
right now?

Unknown Speaker  22:37
You did indeed.

Frank Key  22:40
I'm sure it's not attributed to someone else.

Unknown Speaker  22:44
I think not.

Frank Key  22:46
Okay, well, he sounds whoever that man is. He sounds a bit like Captain flask of the HMS corrugated cardboard, who was a bad and dangerous man. He never washed his hair. And he was fond of tormenting badges. his ship was falling apart, because whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something, but the rigging or a focus or, or even the whole all up deck, he would fly into a rage, like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed and go back down below decks to their scrimshaw and Grog. Every day, all day, and every night All night, Captain flass converged around the deck, shouting at the sky in the pocket of his Westgate, where he's fun watch ought to have been, he kept a supply of Tim baubles, and he would throw these any birds that came within his range, particularly given malts which he loved and cormorants, which he did not understand. But his aim was not good, and he usually missed. One of his arms was withered from scrofula.

Frank Key  24:08
His farm watch by abandoned in the untidy drawer of is ask rich while hidden among old pencils, bits of Calico drawing pins, bottled tops cornflakes and dust. Every morning at six o'clock, or whatever it was time it was in the mall in marathon parlance. Captain flask, drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia Oh, he was such a bad man. He was such a dangerous man.

Frank Key  25:03
I'd like to read to you now a very short extract from Jared Manley Hopkins his journal from 1863. grind, grind, read great. Grote. Great, great crash crush Creek croak crate. crack. Dracula's crackle.

Unknown Speaker  25:41
J is for jars. It is vitally important to keep all your substances in separate labeled jars. Nothing good can come from mistaking your terps for your suid or vice versa. It can also help to arrange your jars in alphabetical order to it, blubber crusts, curd, do grease or its pips, spume. ollege vapor way. This of course is only an example and you may own an entirely different set of substances.

Frank Key  26:33
To end this week show a quotation from William Beckford Manor, William Beckford, from dreams, waking thoughts and incidents in a series of letters from various parts of Europe. And this is from letter one, written on June 19 1780. I fancy the sepulchral voice exclaiming, worship my toe at Ghent, my ribs Florence, my scowl at belanja Sienna and Rome. Be aware how you neglect this order for my bones as well as my spirit have the miraculous property of being here, there and everywhere and hurrying into the open air. I was world away in the dark to Margate

Unknown Speaker  28:01
a few more minutes so let's finish with Ruth pastries latest research project, which is to tabulate the ways in which people reply to the question How are you most of which begin from an assumption that we live in a veil of tears thus you may respond not too bad really bearing up considering not so bad. Oh well could be worse could net can complain really followed by complaint mustn't grumble, followed by a grumble. A related remark and when we hear a tooting yard recommend for detailed analysis is worse things happen at sea.

Frank Key  29:00
A quick update on the hooting yard website is still under reconstruction. After being attacked by cyber Gremlins and fiends have the fiends of the information superhighway. But hopefully it will be back soon. Fighting fit and ready to go again. But the moment is still still under repair. But as I say, I should be back soon. And when it is you can visit it at hooting yard.org and I think that's it for this week. Eventually filled out with lots of bits and bobs. Rami did at random from the hooting yard archives. Hope you've enjoyed it and if you haven't when you finish writing your
