Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM This is hooting yard on the air. And my name is Frank K. I ought to mention, you've just heard the thing about the fundraiser the weekend after next among the items being auctioned at that fundraiser will be extremely rare copies of the 20 year old books, Derrick, the dust particle and bring me the head of Derek's the dust particle, illustrated by me, written by Perry Natal. So they'll be up for auction live at about one o'clock on in the afternoon on Sunday, as far as I recall. Anyway, so don't forget that. That's the weekend after next. Now, onwards with the show, I learned the other day. That apparently, on what in Flemish is known as het internet, there are sites other than hooting yard. Apparently, there's all sorts of other stuff available other than my my website, and I can't quite I'm quite bewildered at the idea that anyone would use the information superhighway to do anything other than to read my work. But apparently it is so amazing, isn't it? What will they think of next? Anyway, I was looking around some of these other sites. And one of the great things is that there's a fantastic number of out of print books available out of print out of copyright books available to read online. And one of the ones I discovered was by Marjorie Verner read and it's called futurist stories written in, written and published in 1919. I don't think Marjorie Verna Reed was one of the Italian futurists the book was published in the United States. But it's extraordinary work. I can't find out anything about her. But I I'm going to read on today's show, a couple of Marjorie Verner reads futurists stories. So here's the first one this is called the dream math. And it is to ik MK f one more day of hora had ended for Russia. This hour once the lamps along there never would have been lighted, the laughter of sleigh riders would have resounded over the snow. But now the streets were dark, deserted, saved by some wandering homeless people seeking refuge in the night. No one seemed to know exactly what had happened or the cause. There was no ruler, no order, darkness and chaos. A girl perhaps of 12 sat huddled in a ragged shawl on the steps of a closed church. There had been a time when a fire burned a mother, a father, brothers, they had gone. No one knew where the mother was royalist she used to so for a great lady, a princess. Perhaps the jailers of a prison could tell where she was. Once in the life that was only a memory. Was it real, or was the biting cold? Was the hunger what had always been her mother had taken her to the house of the great lady. Her eyes had opened in childish wonder as the princess took her from room to room on a great couch of palest blue among cushions that were all lace and blue and pink. A math it had been carelessly thrown down. She had loved it. her greatest desire had been to touch it to feel the soft gray fell on her face. A piercing wind blew from the frozen river. The math, it would come it would keep her warm. She would put her hand in it and hold it to her heart. Through half closed lids, she saw the math curving and swaying in the air, like a gray bird.

It was looking for her. There were so many freezing children in the streets. She was small for her age. how warm? How kind of the princess to send the math. Maybe mother will soon be home from work. We can have supper, Boris will come from school. But Boris lay dying prisoner in the enemy's land. When a pale sons struggle to shine down on the dirty streets, on the confusion and sorrow of that Russian city, an old priest dying with all the rest of sorrow for his land, found the frozen body of a little girl with hands clasped over her heart, a faint smile on her upturned face.

Film review time now. The hair bells are in bloom and there is a man prancing along waving a stick. There is flocks and flax, campion's, Pink's, hollyhocks, and B borage chrysanthemums and veck. Daily is higher since and delphiniums and all the colors seem reflected in the man's cravat. It is silken and embroidered with fantastic skill. One admires the casual yet stylish way he has knotted it about his neck. his hat to with its elegant angles is pleasing to the eye. He rounds a pond still waving his stick. The pond is home to mergansers, teal and some ferocious swans. The sun emerges from behind an impossibly fluffy cloud and Bay's the scene in light so bright it bleaches the color from things the man makes a pause and dips his hand into a pocket of his blazer from whence he plucks a pair of sunglasses, and in one easy movement slides them behind his ears and onto his nose while still managing that rhythmic wave of the stick with his other hand. a flock of swallows swoops across the sky, the man continues walking now past the large stone edifice quite a wonder of masonry. It looks as if it has been plumped down here in this field that random long ago for imparted is crumbling, and it is tilted where the ground has subsided slightly beneath it. Much writing is carved upon one face of it and the man stops and stops waving his stick and reads the words.

Here lie the mortal bones of the mighty king and champion vog lob thrust by sword and fire into the ethereal gray mist beyond who in his time smashed all on earth that had to be smashed, and in his reign spoke with birds, and in His Kingdom did let grow towering hollyhocks and trees of quince he undid his foes and spies and scum. His head was huge. His cranium solid is the rock of bed. So from which this tomb has been hewn, to mark the spot where he fell on that awful day when puny rankers through leisure domain and conjuring tricked his majestic person and brought his realm to ruin. his bones rot and his flesh be eaten by worms, his memory held in the beaks of the birds and the pips and buds and petals of the fruits and flowers. Oh, Mighty vagal up, let thine enemy shrivel up in terror at your magnificence this day, and all days hence until your kingdom is built again with stone and sweat, then balloons and big flying machine trillions will soar across the sky proclaiming on banners to all Earth Your glory. It shall be. All of this is in Latin or possibly go to Latin, but we're given subtitles. having read it, the man spits upon the masonry and strolls on again waving his stick. Suddenly in the harsh sunlight from nowhere comes a trio of grunting toughs, who Maul and manhandle him to the ground and drag him into a pit. The light grows brighter until the screen is completely white, and then appear in a lovely font, bold and black, the words I profaned at King's tomb. Peter devries, the mackerel Plaza, MC NLV I that's the opening of horse ghacks new film, ooh berliet of Fox, the follow up to his award winning hat on to bite where that earlier masterpiece limited itself to a small group of Belgians eating breakfast in a cafeteria. This latest work operates on a much broader Canvas, at least in terms of ambition. Granted, after the opening scene, the bulk of the action, if we can call it that takes place in the EU berliet have the title, a tenebrous hellholes scarcely more expansive than the breakfast cafeteria, in which various semi visible Fox and Bravo's grown and languish but this is primarily a film of ideas, ideas, hatched not by horse gag, but by his wife and collaborator, actrix Primrose dent, international woman of mystery. So what we have over three or more hours is a series of meditations upon kingship, temporal power, being eaten by worms, and the desperate quandary of Fox consigned to an EU berliet for profaning, a king long dead. If we live, we live to trade on dead kings, go the words of the song, and this perhaps was the refrain running through Primrose dense head, a she wrote the screenplay while jetting between important capital cities, staying in expensive hotels, and sipping cocktails on terraces, which not so long ago, or not too far in the future ran or would yet run with the blood spilled by revolutionaries or counter revolutionaries, and in some cases by irredentist. It is this context which makes the film so rich so appealing, and it certainly compensates for Horst ghacks trademark cack handed camera work and those infuriating long girls of which he seems so fond. Or perhaps as the critic Giles lap point has asserted more than once, the prize winning director is simply a hapless incompetent. Oddly enough, lapwing himself actually has a walk on part in the film. In a piece of bravura Hyper Realism host gak shows him being abducted from his pointy town, Pierre de terre bungled onto a rickety cart and driven by wild horses across a desolate and unspeakable landscape before being thrown by the same trio of toughs into the EU berliet.

What are horse gak and mysterious Primrose dent trying to tell us here? For if there is one thing the world knows about Giles lapwing, it is that he is the most unfair picture of men. Indeed, such as the general shabbiness of his appearance and demeanor that he has on countless occasions been ejected from sophisticated soirees much like the Emerald Isle crooner Van Morrison. Sometimes the pair of them have been kicked into the streets in tandem memorably when trying to gain access to their own joint birthday party, the grand Metropolitan palace, oh, Fox and dandies on the key side regeneration zone, so hooligans Wharf, by all accounts, lapwing, and Morrison were pursued by outrage palace habituate to the end of the pier, whereupon they toppled into the sea and had to swim out to a barnacle encrusted rock. voobly at a fox is certainly a challenging piece of cinema, and it will be interesting to see what the critics make of it, if indeed any of them. Get it. chance to see it. Word has it that while Horst gak is printing himself ready for the festival circuit, Primrose dent is keeping all existing prints of the film under lock and key in one of her mysterious secret cavernous subterranean secure storage facilities. There are at least four of these on each continent. Their exact locations of course, known only to the international woman of mystery herself. Horse gak is apparently ignorant of their existence, happily accepting his wife's increasingly no MC pronouncements issued in the form of scribbled notes passed over the breakfast table. It is all very reminiscent of this scene in het ont bite, where the husband and wife at the cafeterias corner table pass coded tea bags to each other. There are at present no plans to release ooh berliet of Fox in 3d, though apparently a smell o vision version is on the cards. The smells will be those of lemon verbena, turpentine and snack barf fog.

So here they are, then the sinus chambers. Not as you might think inside somebody's head, but out in the open in a field enormous built of some tough metal with rivets. They can be seen for miles around for this is a flat country, part of it below sea level, though we're far from the coast, though so easily visible. Lots and lots of people have come to the fields to get a closer look. There are picnics taking place, Sam in the shadow cast by the mighty sinus chambers beneath the sun glittering in a cloudless blue, or struck tinies gasp as do their parents who forget the picnic sausages and lemonade as they gaze up at the giant construction. it being a field we have field officers stationed here and there to keep order. We have people on the ground to lying flat at regular intervals all the way from the Coach Park to the ground just yards from weather sinus chambers tower over us. Both the field officers and the people on the ground have been issued with badges as identification. The badges are enamel and have upon them a device showing the signers chambers in miniature and an arrow pointing up towards their own inside the head sinus chambers. Everybody has had to be very careful when pinning on their badges to ensure they are correctly aligned. Imagine the rumpus if an arrow pointed in the wrong direction. during the afternoon, the huge metal sinus chambers slowly fill up with liquid. It has been specially prepared by boffins using a formula they have kept secret from rival boffins some foreign some bad. When the fluid reaches a level marked upon the side of each sinus chamber in fluorescent Zaremba, a hooter will be sounded and the draining will begin. The piping and the siphons and the funnels and the nozzles have been checked and rechecked by a specialist team flown in from a far off country of which we know little. picnic hampers are packed away and the shrieks of delight and frolic die in the throats of the Chinese and their parents. In the Coach Park. The drivers huddled by the kiosk stubbed out their cigarette and gaze towards the field. Those who hold to their Catholicism like hurried signs of the cross. Even the birds perched in the trees are silenced. There is a deafening metallic Giada and Clank. And then the gurgling begins

There is a second futurists story by Marjorie Verner read from 1919. I can't remember if I told you that the one I read earlier was called the math. This one is called, in Algiers. Moonlight, the still waters of the ocean, the deck of a ship, romance and beauty. The great liner sail near the northern coast of Africa. On the deck, they had become engaged. The moonlight shone on them dusk and bitter cold, a young woman paced up and down in the snow, waiting the coming of a train. It was a small town in the interior of Russia, of the Russia torn by wars and rebellions at home, a sorrow stricken land. The mystery, the romance of the night, the distant shores of Africa seemed still upon her. She could almost feel the murmur of the water as it splashed against the boat. And the next day, Algiers, the quaint streets, the mosques, flowers and white robed Arabs. very quietly they had been married in the cathedral, which bears the name of a whole continent, not throw down that leak. The sun had smiled as it shone on the city by the sea. It grew colder. A train came into sight on the vast field of snow. on that train, the man she loved and had married was coming to her. That in chanted period in Algiers. He was returning, perhaps a wreck of his once splendid self, a cripple war shattered homes brought skeletons were once children laughed, brought famine. Once birds had eaten crumbs, war, horror, dismay, she waited. His eyes were aghast, eyes that had seen death, murder, horror, side by side. There was no more laughter. He took Anna into his arms. Then the report was not true. He had not given his right arm. Anna, he whispered. My brave Anna. I have been thinking of Algiers, she murmured. We planned to have sunshine and roses, even among the snows of our country. But we faced blood, blood on the snows of our forests. Ivan, it is bitter cold. Do not go out into the night to Africa, the moon will be making golden streaks upon the water. A rose will be blooming in our garden. His eyes were vacant. Then it was not his arm he had given for Russia. It was a cry pierced the cold air. The weight of a dead body resounded. I wonder what that was? Ivan mused, which is the shortest way to the cathedral. These Arab streets are so steep.

It's absolutely fantastic stuff. You can find a link to the whole book on the hooting yard website. And I might read some more of them next week or the week after. But I'll leave you with this quotation from amphetamines book ex libris Confessions of a common reader who bet an Englishman the legendary sir john Franklin could have managed to die of starvation and scurvy along with all 129 of his Men in a region of the Canadian Arctic whose game had supported an Eskimo colony for centuries, when the corpses of some of Franklin's officers and crew were later discovered miles from their ships, the men were found to have left behind their guns, but lugs such essentials as monogrammed silver cutlery, a backgammon board, a cigar case, a close brush, a 10 of button polish, and a copy of the vicar of Wakefield. These men may have been incompetent bunglers, but by God, they were gentlemen. As Am I as am I hope you've enjoyed the show. Go to the hooting yard website for your hooting yard needs apparently is the most popular site on the entire information superhighway According to figures that I have, which may or may not be correct. Anyway, yes, that's it. Bye bye back next week.
