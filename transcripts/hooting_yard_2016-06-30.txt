Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank Kay and this is hooting out on the air. Last week, I read to you two tales of Hoon, taken from tales of Hoon, which is an out of print pamphlet published in 1987 by the malice aforethought press tales of Hoon crumpled yarns by Frank key with three maps and an exciting diagram. I can't show you the maps or the diagram, but I can read you the stories. And last week we had the ascent of the mountain at Hoon, and an anecdote about the botanical gardens at Hoon, and we'll start this week with a lecture delivered in the big tent at hoon. If I can find it.

Good evening, I find it difficult to express how enormously pleased I am to see so many of you gathered here squatting on rough hewn wooden stalls and have gladdening it is that most of you have managed to bring along a fine selection of farm implements. By it may well come in useful as illustrative material later on, if I managed to fit in the audience participation segment of my lecture. But there may not be time, we have to be out of here of the tent by 930 as apparently it's needed for a big display of pencil crushing equipment. Still, we have until when so let me waste no more time. verbling preliminaries clears throat seldom have criminality and wickedness been better personified than by karpin and flub the evil guru whose careers I wish to discuss this evening. Let me begin by outlining the pangeran drums. I'm sorry, that doesn't mean anything. shuffles papers. winces Let me begin by reading from the judges summing up but Karpinski trial karpin has suffered tortures best left to the imagination, drawn his breath in shaking salt, turned the animals loose, and has a power that men no not. He held the boards for seven terrible week, he burned fish, approaching the startled cellist. He was seen grinding the pressure ridges, smashing great blocks of ice. He did not have time to rest. The corral under some sheaves of outs, and very snugly wrapped, he dropped his biscuit. Soon, he was dismissed, he was dreaming of all sorts of extraordinary things. I saw him lift a man by the seat of government, rub down his horse and feed him apples. He even went so far as to hire hop rig buggy to take a little spin along the banks of foreign streams, procuring big booty, and professing to be a detective. It was indeed a wild Sabbath night. karpin was furious with rage, one foot upon the iron rail and enormous net of steel, and his pack pony became visible. The time of winter, dog travel was now approaching the earth, gritty and metallic could have bitten a gondola living room is flanked the peristyle and webs of incandescent creepy lamps. Shawna head of the damp gray relics, curtain tracks down reports of locusts warms, he hoped twice slipped beneath the sea, went to work on a huge pile of food and tore up the lettuce. This pouch on folding is rattling became a sizzling even the nearby gravel crushes were keenly aware of terpenes bone fingering embedded in mud. Gently in order not to raise clouds of ooze. He blocked it incredible ropes from agent ox hoof caught in official curve or pump Pretend to the expensive bicycle crate. He touched up the junior facade deck is troublesome horse and tampered no more with the tin roof. in fear and chaos under a bridge or a water tower, he became dusty blue with raid. Clear clears throat with age, like a sheet, like rugs, like concrete piles driven and steals strong. Drying hazelnuts, this evil man on a screened porch with a syrup bottle provided by his hostess, punched, drilled and reached a fine convenient perch. He clapped a boat to one's whistle to his lips, strangling the opposition throat, but his heart was seized by poisonous timber in a modest salt box structure of bedded casements he brought a big kettle of Quaker Quahog berry candles safely passed rocks made in Congress by a regatta in a dying wind. They're examples of restoration one wouldn't farm with left foot thrust forward and in summer often charmless

to converse with distant sheep. karpin thundered past burning However, he liked it better than merely Primrose, blown by an icy blizzard. He had been trying out hemp and its byproduct, twine, matting and sacks. On the room, the seeming anachronism of curtains indigenous cable plate politely softened, the blue invalid jetty. He placed the wire cone with its point aimed strewn torrents and a rack and pinion Railway, harder rarefied tremendous. On the Seminole formidable enough for karpin it was the end significant polls I think that speaks for itself as evidence of corruptions monstrous calumny. Of course, there was the usual small detachment of wishy washy polled prunes, who said that the judges sentence was too harsh. But what on earth do you do with a man like that except put him into a big iron pot and send it catapulting into the stratosphere?

Excuse me. We come then to his wily accomplice. flub. In the public mind flub one greater sympathies and karpin were caught up in was seen to be fairly riddled with infestations of abominable wickedness. flub was perhaps merely a cretinous apprentice. But is this true? Well, let's take a look at the catalogue of crimes which flood committed before that fateful meeting with Kirpan, the base works. Once again, my source is the trial transcript. Be it known that the said flub has confessed to the following stupendously wicked deeds, abnormal behavior in the Botanical Gardens bamboozlement of the grossest kind, clutching a bag of wheat husks in his sweaty fist, dental irregularities, employment of minors for the purpose of illicit girdling forging railway timetables, driving in the dark. hooting at elderly farmyard animals, implacable dribbling, jumping off wooden crates, nicking a quite disgusting balaclava leaning against a zoo malfeasance in a charlo house, not paying corkage oddly laced boots, pouring forth incandescent light in a public place. quietude when surfing, rib cage or booth, skulking about very suspiciously, Tara diddle, and erg got up routing foliage with his teeth, very ill and horseplay wiggling unnecessarily in a lab. x raying entire continent without permission. yodeling aboard a tractor zest for crumpled briefly things. The list goes on, but time is tight. We must continue a pace. It is obvious then the flood was as much juvenile offenders is partner, if not more. So, indeed a careful examination of his brain tissue. Suddenly hoists aloft plastic bag full of glue would show us. I do apologize. replace his bag in pocket. Sorry about that. Wipe hands on sleeves. Sorry. A careful examination of the diaries kept by the two men during their reign of terror would show us that if anything, flub was the real mastermind, karpin merely doing his bidding in exchange for a boiled sweet a pencil case or some other little token of appreciation. Is it possible then, that the public image the public perception of the two fields is awry that a monstrous injustice has occurred? You will recall that flub was not sentenced to be put into a big iron pot, etc, etc. No, the judge decided that he was a poor misled Ergin who deserved a second chance that it was that he was banished to a pompous land thousands of miles away to dawn flags and buff up ceremonial shields with a frayed rag. So far as any of us know, he remains there, doubtless continuing to plot inordinately foul crimes or does he? I am now able to confirm what some of us have long suspected that flub has decamped from his banishment and is even as I speak here among us in Hoon flourishes grubby piece of paper. I hold in my hand, a letter from this Hound of hell. Allow me to read it to you. Dale wildomar it begins. I never cease to be astonished by the head rows of hoon. Where else can one see topiary? So enigmatic, so imperious? Ah, how I missed them in that pompous land of my exile, where the hedges were dappled with pinks, foxgloves, and many other flowers I knew not beauteous as they were, I yearned to see the hedgerows of my home in all their magnificence. I have at last began work on my magnum opus, topiary and miscegenation, sorting out 10 years worth of scribbled,

jottings, Notes and references. It is tough work but rewarding for a lot. I eat only little drink even less and can hardly bear to sleep. My mind is on fire with incalculably evil schemes of iniquity and mayhem, most of which I hope to put into practice within the next fortnight, God willing, as I write the evening like shimmers around me, and tiny winged things flutter about my head. I feel that I am enveloped by a transcendent stillness, as if someone had bashed in my skull with an ads light. incandescence, Grace, I may yet find grace. But I've actually signed passionately yours flub an intriguing document. Naturally, I submitted it to a battery of forensic tests to confirm its authenticity. It appears to be genuine, although I have yet to subjected to the final test, perhaps the most trustworthy one. I speak of course of the bales Frampton experiment, only recently developed. It is visually most attractive, so I thought it might be a rather stimulating climax to my lecture. Please Don your goggles. You will find them nestling and he will still consider construct immense panoply of esoteric Bakelite equipment on dice, Don's goggles, equipment was harmed, shoot sparks etc. carried out bales Frampton experiment on grabbing a sheet of paper, removed goggles. Apparently this is a genuine document. In other words, flub has eluded peacekeepers and returned to Hoon, a criminal genius lurks once again in our midst means you may remove your goggles. That appears to be all we have time for, I'm afraid. peers, peers towards back of 10 I am being quest, gesticulated that by the janitor. Thank you so much. Are there any questions very quickly, member of audience poses a question. Thank you. Indeed. Pat jacket pocket melodramatically. What is this bag of goo in my pocket, which I suggested was the vial. jelly your brain. Haha. I am still being just stipulate to that by the janitor. And most pertinent question if I may say so. The janitor is still gesticulating, I'm afraid we will have to make way for those damn pencil crushing people. Thank you again, very much, and good night.

And then finally, here is the fourth and final title of hoon. Although I think from memory and we're going back 29 years but I think from memory this was the second one to be written. This called massacre of the innocence at home, and it's my favorite, I think. splattered with seagull droppings. The woman of twigs stood at the very edge of the cliff, her back to the sea. barefoot, she rocks gently back and forth on her impromptu podium, made of lightweight cork. The villagers were gathered about her record and snuggling. Some carried picked forks or little tin boxes full of bit by what all is as they waited for the woman of twigs to speak. She had blindfolded herself with a threadbare bandage, bound her hair into tufts with flax and yarn and route and held in her hands, a narrow ribbon of bloody silk. precisely the moment that the thousandth wave of the day crashed against the rocks below. The woman of twigs seest her rocking, cast the silk ribbon to the wind and shouting to make herself heard over the screeching goals began. You asked me to save the village from doom. I have communed with a variety of weird and rather tiresome shades in order to seek guidance. You are right you're really is imperiled. There is only one way to rescue it from the coming agony. Three of your number must travel many miles distant to the town of hoon. There they must find a turn, possibly broken occurred which has had engraved upon it, or rather fetching the rightness of myself. Do not ask why. Having scoured Hoon for this churn and found in Hoon, this churn, it must be brought back here with Drew haste, and hold off the cliff at this very spot. That task complete your village will once again no glory I have left. I have left one or two crucial. I have left one crucial point and mentioned. The three who will venture to whom they're to find and return the churn must all be called nade. That is all. Work began at once on building the chariot. In the kitchens the villagers boiled up huge giant pans full of mud, and silt dried from the riverbed. trees were felled. In the Spinney. The Smithy and his Advil beat out a vast number of rails spikes and very sharp hooks. Within a week, the foul smelling but indestructible vehicle was ready. Volunteers fanned out across the countryside to crap a suitable beast of burden. Horses, oxen, even a crippled reindeer of great elegance were cited and stalked, but another week elapsed without success. Eventually, it was decided that the three Ned's would have to travel under their own steam pulling the chariot themselves. Ned, Ned and Ned agreed, drooling with excitement in their eagerness to set out on Gloria said jurnee

left the religion at Gallup in the middle of the night without maps by relied entirely on local lore and superstition. from infancy, Ned, Ned and Ned had been imbued with a long Catechism of saws and Proverbs. Now he had especially engraved on his skull, a different couplet handed down through generations. If you wish to go to Hoon, spit three times and follow the moon hoons beyond Yon crumpled head, hemmed around by gorse, and said, when you see eight pebbles strewn, your eight days and nights from whom they traveled without pools to dragging the stinking chariot while one lay bundled in it, sleeping or feeding from a polythene bag for the curdled slot. At first, they followed the course of the river until suddenly wormed its way underground. For 18 months, they traveled through a desert landscape, flat, gray, and curiously regiment of shirred. But as I approach tunes hinterland, things changed. in rapid succession they passed and asbestos works. a barrel of rainwater, a customs post, damp Hector's an epidemic of scrofula fence posts, grotesque carvings, horrifying shrubbery, improbable water tables, Jerry built huts, a kailyn quarry lumps of disgust monstrous gulches nebulous stretches of pointed Bramley things, ornithologist hideaways, parakeet enclosures, quarantine sheds, Rusk markets, strange gobbets of sludge, a tremendous farm yard. Earn burials are vacuum wrestling pythons extravagant bank to the yellow fog, yeast traffickers and zipper cracking factory. Ned said to Ned and Ned. Soon we shall enter Hoon, I feel it in my bones. He was not mistaken. The great South Gate of Hoon was over 1000 years old and completely overgrown by clumps of hideous fleshy foliage using poisonous SAP. All attempts to destroy this abominable vegetation had met with failure, and had been impossible to open the gate for at least two centuries. Rather than blasting a hole in the town wall, a ramshackle lift system had been knocked up close by two wooden platforms, one either side of the Great Wall were raised and lowered by an intricate system of pulleys and winches, operated by a team of gatekeepers wearing boa constrictor masks. In return for their labors they expected they exact at a hefty price. Unfortunately, Ned Ned and Ned were utterly penniless, muttering among themselves, they decided to proffer gifts as payment in kind. Ned offered the gatekeepers his cap, which was made of rusted whisks. Ned presented them with a sick Toad he had been pampering for the last month. Lastly, Ned gave them a hand full of silt scraped from the underside of the chariot. The gatekeepers were well pleased with these enticing presence, and allowed the exhausted crio to clamber onto the lift. Two days later, the three meds were eventually lowered to the ground on the other side of the wall. At last, they were in Hoon itself. Finding the possibly broken Kern could only be a matter of time, they would be implacable ferreting into every corner of the ancient town. As soon as they had disembark from the wooden platform, however, they were set upon by a whirling tangle of ruffians, who bashed them senseless, stole the shirts off their backs, empty their polythene bags of slops into the gutter, holy dismantled the chariot had at them with ferocious scimitars and left them for dead. And indeed, Ned ended with dead Ned planted his last breath Two hours later, having been carried off by passing stretcher bearers. Although they were not aware of it,

the 19 brutes who slew Ned Ned and Ned were distantly related, and that they shared a common ancestor, the medieval troubadour, quack apothecary, and alchemists. Slava damn gubbins. 1213 1342 1398 goblins traveled in and around the hinterland of Hoon, all his life, competing in archery tournament, whaling his true list urges, and pedaling heretical tracks and MP MPs GUI appointments, summon tahune in 1386 by the ecclesiastical court, gubbins gathered about him an army of vagabonds and laid the town under siege, circumnavigating the town walls astride his to book your horse, he kept up the spirits of his gruesome band, by smearing their scouts with ambergris key and teaching them simple conjuring tricks. He had his command, a vast array of weaponry, all of it of his own invention, far bins, Pan purges gobs, a small Fram, and many handheld weapons including a Forbes hooter. I'll leave the latter is still in use. Although in its modern version, it is hardly recognizable. diagrams and specifications for the majority of gubbins is ingenious engines are in the strong room of the museum at hoon. Despite his superior firepower, gubbins was unable to secure a victory. After 12 years, the burgers of who'd eventually lost patience. gubbins was viewed to a cave on the coast, believing that the papal nuncio would be there to parlay with him. He went alone, leaving his army under the command of his Latter Day henchmen and Lieutenant impuesto Von Erich. Entering the dismal cave, gubbins was arrested and dragged off in trains. He was put aboard a raft and towed far out to sea before being abandoned his fate. parish records of the time indicate that there may well have been the occasional sighting from coastal outcrops. Over the next few months, and stories began to circulate that gubbins had been transformed into a rumba semi aquatic beast of malign intent, luring seaborne divines to a hideous watery doom. Most commentators now agree, however, that he must have perished shortly after being cast adrift. thrown into disarray by their leaders disappearance, and distrustful of impuesto Von Erich, the vagabond army dispersed. Wozniak himself made peace with the townspeople and became a well loved citizen of whom he served a brief prison sentence for his part in the seed, but was later instrumental in establishing both the House of terps and the ink factory. Until recently, a granite statue of impugn ovonic stood in a leafy square near the South Gate. Sadly, it vanished one day in inexplicable puff of rosy eight vapor, and has not been seen since. The ruffians were unaware of their shared history. Nevertheless, nevertheless, they were thrown together by a bond of hectic brutality and violence, together with a predilection for long hikes. Having pounded Ned Ned and Ned into the dust, they scampered off as one leaving Hoon by the western gate and making for the mountain. They stopped for a rest at the kailyn quarry, devouring their packed lunches with gusto. them as night came down, they strode up the mountainside to view the boundless firmament.
