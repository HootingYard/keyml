This is resonance while I 4.4 fm. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air with a bit of shoma docs. The story goes that she went out hiking one morning and never came home. Some said she had a crisp with a Tinker and ran away with him to his Glen. Others spoke of a mysterious hot, hot air balloon spotted in the sky above the goatee place around noon. The parish priest insisted he saw her waving from its basket, but he was an old and foolish man, and had had sundry hallucinations. There were those who mattered in the shadows of dark and desperate deeds. Before she left the bent of shell murdochs ate an egg on toast and drank half a bottle of gin. She took the time to wash her dishes and place them on the drainer but she left her purse and keys and past bought an engagement ring upon the kitchen table next to a sauce so she used as an ashtray. Had she planned her disappearance? Or had she not? The bench fiance the really Dressler with much distraught in the market square by the horse trough he beloved like a baby as night fell and there was no sign of her. The Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman collected his tears in a cup and boiled them that she might see in the cloud of steam or vision of the bent and her present were about but the steam vouchsafed naught but unreadable swellings. So the Whoo hoo hoo hoo, the woman next visca rated a few hens and read their hot, bloody and trails, again to no avail. The bent of shoma docs had vanished off the face of the earth. On the first anniversary, the village folk gathered in a barn and sang songs for her. They would have lit candles to had the parish priest not eating them all in his madness. The songs they sang were the current popular hits of the village and its hinterland with newly minted lyrics, some penned by the village wrestler who still wept every day. Oh, where is she now my show Murdoch's bent, I dabit my tears with a poor scrap of lint, if only the gods would let drop a hint of where she has gone to my show Murdoch's bent the parish priest whose chain was lengthened so he could just about reached the doorway of the bomb, tried to offer up a prayer for the immortal soul of the bent, but he forgot why he was there and blessed a couple of cows instead, the names of the cows were pushed Ghassan distefano. They were terrific cows, the pride of the village, and the bent had oftentimes patted their heads and whispered in their ears in that sozzled way of hers. The commemoration was repeated in subsequent years, always with new songs from the village wrestler still weeping copiously and with haphazard blessings from the parish priest. One time he managed a spark of lucidity, and actually prayed for the bent vote. Usually his benediction fell upon the cows, or a patch of blue pins, or even the train that In short, he did not stray beyond the village. The Whoo hoo hoo the woman refused to attend any of these ceremonies. But she had not forgotten about the bent of Shama docks, within her hovel among her dried up poisonous plants and toads and beetles and pins and pokey sticks. She carried on her eldritch flummery in secret. She had somehow got hold of the bent passport, abandoned on the kitchen table, and made dozens upon dozens of copies of the photograph. They're in on the photo. The machine in the village post office and plastered the walls of her hovel with them. The bent stared out at her sour gin soaked and half asleep. The Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo the woman became fixated upon the bent smudge lipstick, convinced the eerily shifting contours of the smudge in the passport photograph held the key to her vanishing.

In some copies, the smudge resemble the subtropical peninsula. In others it looked like a Heron. On the ninth anniversary, the villages eschewed the barn and gathered instead at the goatee place. The parish priests chain had been shortened after he frightens and swans in the summer just gone, and he stayed in his presbytery, sucking on lettuce leaves for their moisture. The really Dressler dabbed at his tear stained eyes with his filthy scrap of lint and sang us threnody. my broken heart has the weight of lead. I can barely talk her out of bed. How many more servings must I shared? My bent is gone, she must be dead. According to the villages ad hoc legal system, these words counted as a binding declaration of the death of the child the dog bent, her home and her remaining personnel effect could now be burned entire, all trace of her expunged and fireworks launched from the village green. The Wrestler could stop crying and seek a new enamorado even with a bent to reappear miraculously alive, she would be invisible to the villages fated to roam among them as a ghost. Which oddly is precisely what happened. At the very moment the final firework fizzled out under squelched underfoot by the village posty. drunken bedraggled and moth eaten the Shama doc bent, emerged from a shrub clump, and staggered across the field into the village. She scares me. She smashed the wind out of the off licence and hiked a bottle of vagabond ruin from the display. But now she was dead to the villages, and nobody saw her. Nobody safer the Whoo hoo hoo hoo Dee woman who inhabited a different lopsided plane. She back into the bent and took her into her hovel, with a pair of them drank their fill, and babbled about the bench lipstick smudge long into the night, When morning came, like charged army unarmed to the bomb, and whispered into the ears of gas and distefano and when the pinch of Sharma docks, and the Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo, the woman and the two terrific cows headed out of the village across the fields, and into the hills and up into the mountains up where the oxygen groups in and they passed. Oh, so happy beyond human can forevermore.

Conquistador your stallion stands in need of company for an adventurer and conqueror, especially one who led the Spanish conquest of Mexico and Peru in the 16th century. This is a lapse on your part. You should never leave your horse alone and abandoned, for it is likely to become fractious. And the last thing you want to have to deal with either in the jungles or the mountains. It's a fractious horse. You might argue that a native Peruvian firing poisonous darts that you throw a blowpipe would cause you more concern than a horse in a bad mood. But there you would be wrong. Let's say that the native Peruvians name is impeccable and his poisoned Dart plunges into your neck. It is true that you would be surprised and have 30 minutes to live as the toxins ravaged your innards. But it's a simple enough matter to pluck the dot out of your flesh and have one of your fellow Conquistadores immediately suck on the puncture, drawing every last drop of poison into his mouth before spitting it out. Apply a medicinal poultice to the tiny hole in your neck and job done. You will be as right as rain and ready to carry on adventuring and conquering. By contrast, if after abandoning your stallion while you clanked off on foot on an errand of death, you return to it to find it lonely, fractious, and temperamental, you may have some difficulty getting back into your saddle, your horse may rear up on its hind legs and make terrifying bellowing noises. If you are not careful, you could end up being crushed under its mighty hooves. a flock of horses spittle might land in your eye, blurring your vision. The rest of your Conquistador troop may have written on ahead, leaving you behind without food or water or a campus. You will know from your training back in Toledo, that it can take hours to become a fractious horse, by which time your chances of catching up with your fellow adventuring conquerors before nightfall are remote. Unless the Conquistador who suck the poison out of your neck has stayed with you. You will now be all alone in a strange, exotic landscape. famished you do not know which fruits and berries are safe to eat. And in any case, there will only be fruits and berries available to you if you are in the jungle. As I pointed out earlier, you might be up in the mountains and there will be little to eat but impacted snow which you will have to melt and soften before trying to shove it down your throat. Bear in mind that the air is very thin up in the higher reaches of the Andes and you will become exhausted quite rapidly, especially if you are expending energy hacking at a patch of snow to make it more easily meltable. Added to these impairments your horse will be hungry too. And it's fractiousness may return with a vengeance. You will have to find a way to locate it a second time, and by now it will be wise to do your tricks, if it is a clever horse would get probably is having been chosen out of so many other horses to go on a conquista dorial campaign. It is also much more difficult to become a frightened horse in the dark and the Peruvian night is far more eerie than the night in Toledo with which both you and your stallion are familiar. A further problem will present itself if a nocturnal Peruvian native fires a second poisonous Dart into your neck through a blowpipe Yes, it is simple enough for you to remove the dot. But without a fellow Conquistador. to suck out the venom, you will have to instruct your horse to do the deed. Not many horses are skilled in such an art. Apart from everything else, their mouths are much bigger than the average conquistador's mouth and their teeth are huge, so it's exceedingly difficult for them to get sufficient purchase on your neck to suck with any conviction. Of course, if you have a vampire horse, it will suck away quite happily. But after draining the poison it will continue to suck your blood until you topple over pale and dead. All things

is a better horse to buy a different horse

He was exceedingly pale, and he sat astride a horse. He was the Pale Horse man. The horse was an elegant nutbrown something or other with splendid fetlocks and a terrific mane. I use the word terrific, because it was terrifying that mean on that horse, it certainly terrified the horse man. Why do you think he was so pale? clip clop along the line went the horse through dense forest, and the horse man sat tall in the saddle, like the best of heroes in a cowboy film. Here it is worth noting that though there are cowboys that are no boy cows, all cows wherever in the world you roam a girl's. As for the horse, be it a girl horse or a boy who was that does not matter to us, and nor did it matter to the horse man, who shuddered as he contemplated it's terrific Maine. But he pulled himself together and clip clop onwards, or rather the horse clip clop while the horsemen sat lanes stretch from pointy town at one end to tan tower a beam at the other. If you are familiar with the geography of this land, and if you are only half educated, you damn well ought to be, you will know it was a very long line indeed. The point where we met the pale horseman deep in the dense forest was roughly halfway along the vein. He was on his way from pointy town to tan tower of him. There were many ins on or just off the lane, which travelers such as the Pale Horse man and his horse could spend the night. Each in was named after an album by Jethro towel, except one known as exotic birds and fruit. Rich shared its name with an album by Procol Harum. This anomaly was occasioned by muddled thinking on the part of the nomenclature of ins purse Weaver and it was a costly Miss attribution, he was taken out and shot. As it happened, the clearing in the forest where the execution took place, was just yards away from where the Pale Horse man stopped his horse that morning. He was intent on paying homage to the purse Weaver and at the spot where he had fallen while his horse scratched innocent behind on a tree. The Pale Horse man stood with head bowed in the clearing, muttering a few words under his breath. Then as a mark of devotion to the departed, he placed on the ground, a piece of fruit taken from his pocket. It was a toughy apple. returning to his horse, the Pale Horse man saw that it was disconcerted and fractious, at Main even more terrific, although he was already deathly pale, such as his terror that the Pale Horse man visibly blanched. In the dense forest, he was surrounded by wood, so had a French person been present. They could have described him as Blanche DuBois. He remounted his horse and set it off at a clip clop towards the seaside Belvedere as of 10 Tara been that night they stayed at the cat fish rising in it was home to a cat, but not to any fish unless one counted a few blennies dead on a slab in the kitchen, ready to be served for supper. The pale horseman was not fond of fish, and opted instead for drugged hair with a side helping of smokers pop tarts. These vittles did nothing to alter his power. And then the in in its stables. The horse was fed and watered from a cement trough. Somewhere in the night. owls hooted and swooped upon small, terrified, scurrying mammals. Usually whenever I recite this story, I pause at this point and invite questions from the audience if there is one. Sometimes there is not. I have told this story while standing on a dice in an empty barn. But if one or two were gathered to hear it, the questions most often asked are Why is the Pale Horse man going from pointy town to tan Tara been and please level with us is the Pale Horse man a personification of death.

very occasionally, someone will ask me to explain what was so terrifying about the horses mane. But nobody nobody has ever asked what was the horse's name? Or did the horse become fractious? Because it's thought it was going to be given the toffee apple as a snack. Whatever questions I'm asked, I like to give full and detailed answers at great length. Last, for example, I might find myself listing every single album released by Jethro Tull. Not only do I give the album titles in chronological order, but I will add the tracklisting and full credits I showed on the sleeve of the original release. If in puckish mood, I will also recite from memory any liner notes, which in the case of thick as a brick 1972 can take up most of the afternoon. If, if an even more packaged mood. I will do the same for the complete Procol harem discography my knowledge of horse men and horses is equally encyclopedic encyclopedic. So, by the time I'm done answering questions, any audience members still awake will almost certainly have forgotten the story so far. They may even have had the pale horseman on his horse and the lane from pointy town to town Tara been wiped from their puny brains, while they fixate upon say, the precise pattern upon the headband habitually worn by stout nimble Glen kornek, bass guitarist of Jethro Tull from 1968 to 1970. When I resume my tail therefore, they barely notice that the Pale Horse man on his horse, a clip clopping slowly slowly along the lane in the opposite direction from tan tower beam to pointy town. When I have them stop around halfway at the clearing, whether nomenclature of ins per suivent was shot, and the pale horseman retrieves the votive toffee apple removes it cellophane wrapping and feed it as a snack to his horse. Some in the audience put up their hands to ask how in the name of heaven the pale horsemen knew the toffee apple was there, lying on the ground in the clearing a few yards off the line, but I shift them and tell them the time for questions is over. And services that they never get to hear how death was visited upon tan tower babe, how every last 10 terabit might from aged krones to toxin tinies toppled over a died at sight of the pale horseman, as drew punishment for some ancient sin, and how for 100 years or more, it was home only to swarms of flies and maggots, and nobody dead after its name.

Last night, I drempt I went to the nocturnal pig observatory again. But it was one of those dreams where everything happens in brightened battering sunlight. This made it particularly disturbing because with the exception of the unfamiliar light, everything else in the dream matched my memories of those times. I sat at the console twiddling the knobs. I made adjustments to the pig scanner with a pair of pliers. I gazed out through the pig proof Plexiglas observation panel while making indentations in my tally stick. One other detail that jarred was the presence within the observatory of an albino chicken. I think it may have been a vanbrugh chicken. It was so white and the sun It's so glaring that the Qin seem to shimmer, like one imagines and angel of the Lord come to Earth upon a visitation. I saw no pigs. So in that sense again, the dream had an error of brute reality. Not once in all my years of Guti at the nocturnal pig Observatory, did I ever spot a real pig? Sham ones? Yes, of course, and puppet pigs and ghosts of pigs, but never a real solid porker. The flat wild, bleak, desolate, windswept top pooter is inimical to pigs Thank heaven, but we must always be on the watch. Or at least we used to back in the days when we were pig ignorant. Now things have changed many safer, the better. Much of the top Kuta is no longer as flat and wild and bleak and desolate and windswept, as once it was, there are ice cream kiosks and miniature zoos and an aerodrome. There is a huge cement statue on a plinth of star of stage and screen googie withers 1917 to 2011. There is even mischievously, an extensive modern state of the art pigsty, though it is of course empty of pigs, including Sham and puppet and ghost pigs. Or is it one would have to creep up to the edge of the pigsty in darkness on a moonless night and train one's portable pigs Ghana upon the most likely ghost haunting parts of the sky and wait in silence and or for a sighting to be duly recorded in one ghost pig log with a notch indented on one's tally stick. Who among us can say we're truly prepared for such a task? Since I awoke I've been thinking like a man obsessed about that shimmering albino chicken. What did its dream presence portend? I can wring no sense from it, as I promised like a ninny across the top pooter. On my way to buy a truck is from the kiosk until my a bouquet of gladiola upon the cement feet of googie withers, that will make my first day complete. And when I settled down to sleep, we're like dream of the nocturnal pig observatory again, will repass home me spill? Do I dare to eat a peach? Is there honey still for tea? Where have all the flowers gone? What's so funny that pigs love and understanding
