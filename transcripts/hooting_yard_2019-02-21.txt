resonance 104 point four f m resonance fm.com that's the station ident My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. And as I announced a few minutes ago, towards the end of pull the plug, I'm going to be reading some stories from a book a book of mine called gravitas, punk teleo, or rectitude, and Pipi bags. If you haven't got a copy of this book. Shame on you. If you'd like to buy a copy, go to the hooting yard website. Look down the right hand side for the cover of the book. Click on that and follow me instructions. Thereafter well worth well worth buying. I think this is tugboat tales. Number one. I want to read a story I can't remember where about a dyspeptic tugboat captain, who wore sinister black gloves and struck fear into his crew. I remember that his name was Captain Bagshaw or shore bag, and that his tugboat was ancient and Rusty and rotten. I think I read the story in a newspaper, which would suggest that it was factual rather than some made up fiction, but I can't be sure. The captain's black gloves were made of wool, and often became tattered and frayed. And I recall a phrase in the story where we were told that he used to dam them with malevolence. I've done a lot of darling in my time for I'm handy with needle and thread and crochet and knitting needles and such like I've done socks and jumpers and balaclavas and mittens though not admittedly gloves that cannot for the life of me think how I might do down something malevolently by God knows I tried to in the weeks and months after reading the story of Captain Bagshaw or shore bag in that newspaper, if it wasn't newspaper, it might have been a periodical eye on you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take off my huge magnifying spectacles and just wipe the lenses because I'm having a bit of a problem seeing as as regular listeners will know I'm pitifully sighted. But hopefully, with a bit of a wipe I should be able to see properly. It might have been a periodical I tried snarling or spitting passing puppy dogs as I damned, but it came across as churlish and bad tempered rather than malevolent. And I felt like a fool. When the captain smiled, he made a sound like the calling of 1000 crows. And when he spat he spat sulfur. There were no puppies on the tugboat, of course, but there was a badger. The captain did not smile at it because it was his creature is familiar. At one point, I think it's described as a demonic backdrop, whatever that may be. I think we were meant to see the captain as a kind of Ahab figure, obsessed and mad as well as sinister. But for me, this effect was floored by the fact that it was a rented tugboat back your shore bag did not own it. Every week, he had to ship some slips and coinage into the waiting palm of a seaside bureaucrat representative of a Dao organization stuffed with accountants and administrators. Their main business seemed to be cific coastline management, and prettifying with renting out a tugboat to a sinister gloved madman as an afterthought. Somehow, that made him less than master of his vessel for me, and I remember touching ruefully as I read the paragraph in which this was explained. whoever wrote this Story clearly felt it was important for it was a very long paragraph leaden with detail and I skipped past it on my subsequent readings

so there was Captain Bagshaw or shore bag on his rented tugboat with his demonic badger and the terror stricken crew. And then there was the radio cabin, a tiny cubby hole squeezed under the earlobe deck. I am no expert on maritime who ha, but I suspect it's unusual for a tugboat to have an all up deck, let alone a radio cabin. Now, illustrations accompany the story and the writer is vague on details about the tugboat specifications. I have to say that this did not bother me when I read it. And it was only years later when I talked about the tugboat with a rattled and Brian soaked old sea dog while on holiday at Oh hooligans Wharf. But I learned of these anomalies. I put them out of mind However, I'm sure there are all sorts of different designs of tugboat plying the harbors of the world, big ones and tiny ones, rotting ones and dreaming ones. Ones that fly flags and ones that don't, and ones with and without all objects and radio cabins. It's only just occurred to me that we're never told the name of the tugboat. The captain's handwriting with spidery but surprisingly legible, given that he never removed his sinister black woolen gloves, even when wielding his fashionable fat fountain pen. It was a sturdy pen and it needed to be because one of the captains enigmatic little ways was the next is ink with glue. He used it to keep these log of course, but was also given to scrawling commands and directives and warnings and decrees on sheets of foolscap and pasting up all over the tugboat. One such Sun was on the door of the radio cabin, forbidding any of the crew to enter in any circumstances at any time ever. The punishment for doing so was not made explicit, but it did not need to be. For as we have seen, Captain baggage or showbag kept the tugboat is in a permanent state of stomach churning terror. As a youth if one could imagine him as a youth. He had studied the methods of tyrants and dictators and megalomaniacs from Joseph Stalin to Paul nabo Heusen and once he stepped aboard his tugboat, even though it was rented, his self belief carried him through. As I have indicated, I may not be convinced of his power, but the crew certainly were. Except that is for the latest recruit a plug ugly, loose limbs, lantern jawed feather hatted, scented and perfumed dimity deckhand who cut his teeth in the Puffin club. I think the writer gives his name, but I can't remember it. Let's pluck a name out of the ether and call him say, Siegfried Sassoon, for the sake of convenience. No, let's not, let's call him Puffin boy. Now, Puffin boy, in addition to being plugged ugly and loose limbed and lanten, Jordan feather hatted and scented and perfumed and dimity was functionally illiterate. He could he could just about manage simple three letter words like Orban lip and jog. But anything more complicated was beyond him, and Captain Bagshaw or showbag like to write his brutish decrees in long winded flowery sentences, such as not to waste even a speck of his foolscap. Plus, it was the Puffin boy blundered into the radio cabin, quite unaware that it was off limits to such as he. Although most of the captain's commands were senseless and deranged, he had good reason to keep his crew away from the radio. He wanted to ensure that no one twiddle the dial away from important seafaring information channels, and instead tuned into a program very popular at that time, called tugboat crew play time. This was a music show,

Frank Key  09:37
which was bound to distract tugboat crews from the tugboat duties, for it featured a roster of presenters with mellifluous voices, who played tunes requested by tugboat crew members from near and far. A typical show would include works by glazunov borodin they burn Hines cow Gruber bailius Petula Clark Conway Twitty Scriabin, the Memphis jug band, our boly letter my Bulu sleater Kinney Sylvester a rave with us. Big Bill broonzy bucks phase Augustus Pablo Bama Bartok, Cliff Richard and the shadows. Morton Feldman, Charles Ives, pragmatic Peter blagoevgrad, Paul Hindemith, George Formby, Mercedes Sosa Jacques Brel, Schubert, Schumann, Monte Verde, Ned Rorem, Quicksilver messenger service, Cassiopeia, Cab Calloway, Fort McCoy Memorial dump mobilia Bell, Burning Spear, Peter Warlock, Kyle Ruggles, the strawberry alarm clock. Joan Baez have a Gao Brian Dennis brain can calm Neutral Milk hotel, and the carpenters. Not only did Puffin boy retune the radio to tugboat crew playtime. Baby managed to jam both the tuner dial and the volume knob. This was not done by design for Puffin boy was an innocent done the pate upon me all up deck Captain Bagshaw or shore bag was stalking around with his demonic badger in tow, when his eardrums were assailed by Janacek the glagolitic mass blaring from down below. As expected, he flew into a rage. What was unexpected was that he did so literally, his feet left the deck, He flaps his arms, and he found himself soaring 40 feet above his rented tugboat. a gust of wind took him then, and he was carried off over the glistening sea into the blue. Months later, an intrepid ornithologist was clambering around on a rocky outcrop, buffeted by wind and waves. peering through his botsman scope, he observed a sea bird's nest that an orc or a skewer I can't recall. And there was the captain in his sinister black gloves, scribbling on a sheet of foolscap with his fashionable fat fountain pen, and the birds were gathered around him screeching madly and trembling with terror. I wish I could tell you what became of the tugboat and its crew, particularly Puffin boy, but the writer confesses he does not know. Perhaps one day I will remember where I read the story and crack down a copy and find that whether it's truth or fiction and tell it to you properly.

It was pale and fierce gulping down a bowl of soup. I wonder if it was jar come to deliver me from Babylon, but I have a very shaky grasp of rastafarianism.

Frank Key  13:29
So I cost that thought until the winds, not that there was much in the way of wind that day. In fact, the air was eerily still. I held off the feather of a carrion Crow, and it did not sound much as tremble. I discarded the feather on the edge of some scrub rife with gorse, and returned my gaze to the pale fifth thing. It was licking the last dregs of soup from its bowl. For as long as I can remember, I've had a deep interest in soup, and I was intrigued to know what had been in that bowl. As always seen the great pity to me that Dobson abandoned what would surely have been his magnum opus, a compendium of all known soup recipes, from a way around the world throughout history. Before taking a step towards the pale face thing, I reached into the pocket of my Paraguayan man of destiny trousers, and took out a box of Swan investors. It would be useful to know if the thing was frightened of the fire before getting any closer. bunching three or four matches together. I struck them across the sandpapery side of the box, and as soon as they lit I flung them across the deck which ran between me and the pale, fierce thing. With no scrub or gauze to ignite for a fell on a patch of bare Earth. The matches sputtered out quickly, but not the For the tiny flames have attracted the things attention with dramatic result that for the now empty soup bowl and scampered away towards the cops or spinny. This is not the place to go into detail about the difference between a cops and a spinny which would involve giving dictionary definitions. So be content with the idea that the pail fish thing was making off with surprising agility towards a clump of trees. They were a mix of punkten and simnel trees, and I worried that once it was within their shelter, excuse me. I worried that once it was within their shelter, I would lose sight of the thing, for they were heavy with buddings spring foliage, fat leaves and dripping pods, all in meshed within a knot of twisting twining tendrils. Earlier in the week on the Tuesday, I'd won a tin cup excellence in pole vaulting at a magnificent sports stadium in pointy town.

Frank Key  16:15
Although a few days have passed without any further jumping about, I will still fit as a fiddle, and I ought to have been able to vote the deck with ease. As it was, I trod on a pebble during my run up and discombobulated, somehow managed to topple over, landing with a squelch at the bottom of the muddy trench, as we've copses and spinneys. So with ditches and trenches, just keep listening. The ditch was deeper than I thought. When eventually I clambered to my feet, I saw the rope that I saw that the mud walls loomed up much higher than my head, and days upon days of rainfall had worn them smooth. I'm very good at sizing up situations rapidly unless dutifully, for I had been a tantaran cadet, and had the captain the captain badges to prove it. Not that I was wearing them. Now of course. I trudge through the mud for at least a mile in both directions, and was astonished at the uniformity of the victories depth and featureless pneus. Nowhere did I come up on a place where I might gain a foothold on some dragon shard or clump of roots. Returning to the spot where I had first fallen, which I had marked cadet fashion by scraping tea for 10 Tara them into the muck with a pointed stick. I reached into another trouser pocket, took out my whistle and popped a shrill blast on it. This would I hope, summon the pail fish thing back from its sanctuary in the spinny. Already you see I had worked out but if I was going to escape this deck, I would need to help. While I waited for it to come to me. My thoughts turn once again to draw Rastafari. I wondered if my predicament was a sufferer ation imposed on me by jar for purposes only he knew. This was so dispiriting that I was in danger of betraying my tantaran cadetship and succumbing to tears. Indeed, I even sniffled once or twice I wanted something to smite, to map me back to my usual gusto. But all I could see was a dick beetle in a puddle up my feet. It was beyond smiting for it had already drowned. I popped on my whistle again. All I knew of the pale, fierce thing other than that it's other than that it's paleness and fierceness with a bit with keen on soup, and frightened by fire. These were the facts I had to work with. As far as I knew it might be deaf and my whistling was in vain. What then I could read chrome to my steps along the ditch going further than a mile in each direction, hoping to find that elusive clump or shard or even on a ladder. But not with falling and I would be blundering about in the dark. Better to remain here. only yards away from the spinny or cops. I did not know what kind of creature

Frank Key  19:42
Excuse me. Yes, I did not know what kind of creature the pale face thing was. But it had a head and arms and legs and possibly a tail. Though of that I was not certain and I had to persuade Myself, so they also have a sense of compassion, surely would want to rescue a pole vaulting tin cup winner, who was also an ex tanto arobin cadet, it might even know something of jar, though that was unlikely, who truly knows jar that can be comforting, theological speculation. Even for a sinner such as me. I gave the whistle a third longer pop and turn my mind to the Divinity or otherwise of Haile Selassie. As if on cue, the head of the pail fears thing. peeks down at me from the edge of the ditch, had shockingly huge bright eyes, like those of a tamarind, but otherwise there was nothing monkey like about that head. Somehow I knew speech would be useless. I merely gazed up at it imploringly. Its head swiveled, left and right with insect speed, and then returned to look at me again. In the mud, I stood to one side and pointed at my tea for 10 power been scraping, did I see a flicker of understanding in those big eyes, it was hard to tell. A carrion crow swooped in to land and perched on the dictators edge, a little away from the pale face thing. It might have been the same crow from which I had plucked a feather to test the wind. But bird and thing looked at each other, and I was aware of an intensity in the space between them mesmerizing icy alien, utterly beyond anything I could comprehend. I squelch my boots in the mud. What would Haile Selassie do? What would job do? What apart from squelching? would I do? I dredged up all I had learned as a tan Tara been cadet, testing the wind with the feather of a carrion Crow, always carrying a box of Swan Vestas and knowing how to strike them three or four time daily pole vaulting practice, with rest periods, never bringing a pan of soup to the boil and transferring the soup to the bowl with death elegance, never tried to eat soup with a fork. The carrion Crow and the pale fair thing we're still gazing one to the other in an uncanny compact. Always buying soup bowls from Huberman collecting the discount vouchers and tucking them neatly into the little Huberman discount voucher wallet provided being Spry and sprightly through the waking hours and on one's palate buying splayed out, checking the mercury six times a day, never using the same sorry, never using. Never using the string that ties one 10th pegs into a bundle as a leash for a dog. the naming of dogs to be restricted to patch or rags or spot praising jar Rastafari discarding the PIP from fruit with care, never making soup with fruit. The sky was black now, but in the faints starlight, I could see silhouetted, the carrion Crow and the pale, fierce thing utterly still, utterly in wrapped by each other. knowing the difference between a Spinney and a cops knowing addict from a trench not being reliant on maps, marking one spot by scraping tea for tan Tara been in the mud with a pointed stick, always carrying a pointed stick. Having the pointed stick threaded through one's dreadlocks to keep the hands free, using the hands to smite things to revive gusto. not smiling that witches drowned, tying knots, keeping one's cadet kept clean and dry. Daily polishing one's badges with a rags steeped in cadet bad Polish from humans, speculating upon the Divinity or otherwise of Haile Selassie regular study of Ethiopian history, a string frippery where air it raises its unseemly had.

Frank Key  24:33
I had been taught that these tantaran cadetship skills would stand me in good stead throughout my days in Babylon, but now to unseemly heads turned to look down at me in the ditch in my ditch, the carrion Crow and the pale, fierce thing and I knew I was the last

We've only got about five minutes left, so I haven't got a lot of time really. I'd like to thank whoever it was who bought the resonance fundraiser auction item, which was a very small colored drawing. painting, I suppose, I think I used crayons with a little poem on it, or couplet, which, as far as I recall was, if you wish to go to Hoon, spec three times and follow the moon. It sold for 50 pounds, which is 50 pounds well spent. And all of that money has gone into the coffers of resonance, to continue to bring you shows like this, unlike pull the plug shows that make your week I think, I hope. Yes, so thanks to whoever bought that. I didn't bother to find out. What In other news, the hooting yard website is back online. But I haven't actually updated it since December. But now it's now it's germ free. I show how to go back to it. You'll probably realize that during the show we've had live knitting from pansy cradle Joe How is the second sock pansy? The second sock is fine. Is that what you're knitting? Now? It is it is what I'm getting. Now. This is the the cuff of the second sock. Sock handcuffs. Who knew who knew that socks have cuffs? The socks have cufflinks. No, but there was the first time for everything. Would I be called cufflinks or sock links? Got spots. Now that's something else. Um Yeah, well anyway, before we go from the hooting yard with live knitting experience. Here's his his Mr. Verse. There was a horrific bus driver. And his name was Kim fat goose. He drove his bus through puddles. He drove it straight and true that he swerved if he saw a doc or a pig or an infant cumin, tiny, or a succubus, or an Incubus. As he stared towards the briny. He drove his bus across pointy town, heading for the sea. At the beach, he stopped to let passengers off, and he drank a flask of tea. Oh, Kim fat goose, he drained his flask and he took the dregs in the sand, and he eyes all the while on the promenade, and he watched a spaceship planned outpoured a gaggle of alien beings with flippers and then Kanye and claws and flagrant disregard for the rubric of pointy town laws. We are an invasion force from the planet of contaminated wheat. We are starveling spacemen and we need something to eat. I will drive you to the pie shop, said fearless Kim fat guru, get on the bus and sit quietly till we reach the pie shop Q. But he drove his bus up into the hills to a hermits abandoned hut and he lured the inviting spacemen in and sealed the doorway shot. So Kim fat guru the bus driver was the savior of pointy town, and that is why his name rings out with imperishable renown.

Bye bye see you next week.
