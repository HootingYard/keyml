Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air half an hour of exciting prose. And that was Valentino the engineer coughing which makes a change for me coughing I suppose. onwards. It occurred to me the other day that I've neglected the subject of pots and Potter's. This is about to change for I've been immersing myself in the study of the pots and Potter's of Subodh Ned Webb, and I'm so enthralled that I can't actually think about anything else. You're more likely to have heard of Subodh Ned Webb in the context of blebs and pustules than Potter's and pots. So Bob NetWare pimple is the common name for a particularly distressing dermatological condition. So called because the medico boffin who first identified it was at the time tackling an outbreak in and around that British Township. It's a big and unsightly pimple, often found erupting on the forehead, where throbs and glows like a third eye. Many subordinate web potters show the scars of past pimple gum, and also sometimes known as the pimple potters. anglepoise refers to them as such in his magisterial, but unpublished survey of their pots and fragments. That so many Subodh med web Potter's pots survive only as shards and fragments is due to the ferocious bombardment of the township by unhinged aggressors every day. For the past 40 years, the township has been subjected to attack. untold tons of pebbles have been catapulted from out with its walls, and every so often a flock of trained swallows flies over dropping other pebbles. So many subordinated web pots have been smashed that the historic township glue factory cannot manufacture enough glue to gum them all back together. The pebble is are motivated by fear of the subordinated web pimple, which they mistakenly believe is contagious. They're also said to hold that the pimple actually is a third eye and that it makes visible rays and beams and lights of such horror that they drive men mad. This is of course a primitive superstition. But then the pebble is are a primitive and stupid people, not one of whom has ever had the wit to fashion a pot. They can't even need dough with any finesse the bats and bands they bake to peddle by the sides of major traffic routes, and not of a consistency or manliness to tempt the major traffic group user who's made the error of purchasing a bag full in the past. anglepoise rightly laments the fragmentary status of much subordinate web pottery, but that doesn't stop him cataloguing it no singing the praises of the pimple Potter's he rescues from obscurity, some of the key figures among them bink bunk, snap tag wims Hearst Ngoc, flam hig blegh zahnd de Havilland shad mufe Tang kuch waec BIP Fang rack ik snit, puck, cherry babe belch cracker font flip sank bark, Dodd woke, jam, pulp, cousins and llamando not all of them were literally pimpled Dodd, for example, was born with a head upon which pimples and pustules and other blebs never grew. But then he was something of a medical anomaly and other ways, ways that confounded his carers, the home for startling young Potter's where he spent his childhood. All That Remains of Dodd's work is a single shard. But what a shard it is. anglepoise gives drew attention over 20 pages of his unpublished manuscript, and tries heroically to extrapolate from the shard a vision of the whole pot. It was he concludes, the sort of pot you would have displayed on a mantel piece, rather than one you might have put to use for holding your grain or your millet. Struck by dozens of pebbles on a single day in the summer of 1969. It was smashed to smithereens all but one of those smithereens was then lost in a flood. There are similar stories of the fate of pots by other named Potter's and of course, there are many fragments and indeed, some surviving whole pots whose potters names we know not.

What is it about sibbald Ned Webb we may ask that makes it such fecund ground for Potter's it's a township built upon clay Of course, but then so many other townships, including the ones where many of the hinged pebble ears were born and raised. The clay itself does not explain things. It's true that clay was mined there long before mines of any kind existed anywhere else. And the township fathers passed an ordinance that there must be at least two working kilns for every habitable dwelling. It's equally true that virtually every other activity in the plastic arts is forbidden. But these can be seen as a response to pot mania rather than its source. sensibly. anglepoise does not get bogged down in sterile academic argument. He says a work of celebration and cataloguing. I found it intriguing to learn from a postscript that he's blind as were a number of the sybok NET web Potter's some like math rack and cracker were born blind, but others lost their sight when their eyes were put out by catapulted pebbles. That PostScript is at times unbearably moving for in it anglepoise describes the many hours he spent in an underground bunker where the shards and fragments are gathered, cutting his hands to ribbons while handling as delicately as he could the often drag it and razor sharp remnants of the potters art. In the end, he had to wear special mittens with sensory devices sewn into them. Now in a game, he would drop a fragment re smashing it as he did so when jumping out of his skin, that's a sudden onslaught of pebbles up above. The roof of the bunker was pocked and pitted with holes were one of the larger train swallows and dropped the big pebble from a great height. Thankfully, netting strung up across the ceiling meant that few if any pebbles ever landed upon the floor of the bunker itself. If anyone has the stomach for it, there's probably a monograph to be written on the unhinged and irrational pebble is themselves. That's a type of pimple a pimple understood and neutralized by medical boffins could provoke such violence over such a period of time is on the face of it extraordinary. Even when we take full measure of the pebble is stupidity. Still we shake our heads in disbelief. There have been calls for brave Potter's to go incognito among the pebble is to teach them how better to need their dough. The thinking being that if they sold more backs and bounds by the sides of major traffic groups, their sense of grievance and their fear of the third eye pimple would be lessened as they grew wealthier. Rare is the potter though willing to take the risk after what happened to hygge hygge it was who volunteered when first The idea was mooted to go among the pebble is freely offering to share his kneading skills. Like DOD, he had never fallen victim to the sibbald Ned web pimple his forehead remaining as smooth and unblemished as a baby's butt is patos jargon betrayed him to the clever of pebble ears, and they broke him on a wheel. anglepoise is so busy extolling and cataloguing that he does not address the curious matter of the pebble his undoubted ability in wheel building, catapult making and the training of swallows. For unfathomably stupid people pray to ridiculous pimple superstitions in these three areas and in the collection of pebbles. They show ingenuity and energy. Perhaps all that's needed is for an enlightened chieftain to emerge in their midst. But alas, the roll call of their chieftains is a litany of thick, heavy brutes and ignorant hotheads that they can show such patience and tenderness when schooling their swallows makes it all the more perplexing. They remains the mystery of why anglepoise cannot find a publisher of his magnificent work. Let's leave aside the bigoted conglomerate which refuses to handle any work by blind authors.

A decision based it seems solely on the poor sales of David Blunkett memoirs, one would think a book that combines a catalogue of pots and pottery fragments, the potted biographies of numberless Potter's some with pimples and some without, and then elegiac pro style would be snapped up by the kinds of punters who buy their books along with sausages and eggs and washing up liquid at out of township supermarket, as it is the manuscript languishes as it has done since its author perished on a blizzard racked mountainside on a shelf in the deepest basement of the Subodh Ned Webb, pimple puncturing and disinfecting, and swabbing and sewing up Treatment Center in the heart of the township. So, subterranean is the basement that no pebbles ever penetrated vaulted ceilings, yet the shelf upon which the manuscript rest is rickety and wormy. And liable to collapse at any moment. If and when it does so, anglepoise his work will topple to the earth and be trodden upon repeatedly by the big stomping boots of the miners, who even today are still opening up a new seams of clay to supply the potter's the endless onslaught of pebbles has failed to stop their potting, and even if their pots last but 10 minutes before being smashed a bit. We can but praise their industry and their tireless podman ship.

Every now and then I get letters from listeners asking me to give some account of the geography of hooting yard and its hinterland. I have a standard reply to such request, which is to say that through diligent study of my work, you could draw a map yourself. It would involve very close reading and listening, being on the alert for clues and pointers. But all the information any half competent cartographer needs is present in the text, which you can read on the website or listen to here. But today, I'm going to make things a little easier for aspiring mappers by saying a few words about the train journey from hooting yards to that Ill starred fishing village Oh hooligans Wharf last week, it would have been fairly pointless to do so. But the exciting news is that the branch line long fallen into disuse attitude is running again, using the proceeds from a winning raffle ticket. Number 666. beige. A team of volunteers is reopened the line as a cross between a countryside heritage family leisure facility and cutting edge art practice installation. I've taken those two phrases from their brochure, a shabby piece of work duplicated on a guest stettner machine designed perhaps to look like one of Dobson's out of print pamphlets. Someone's gone to the trouble of hand coloring all the covers though, which shows the fanatical devotion of these enthusiasts. I'm not one of those nutters myself, but I know the journey as well as I know the first three books of Paradise Lost. So take my hand encased in a butcher's mitten, and I shall lead you along the way. Our thrilling railway excursion begins naturally enough hooting yard. What was once a gigantic Terminus alive with hubbub is now a ruin, which serves mostly as a roost for sparrows. However, the volunteers have recreated a very convincing facsimile of one of the original platforms. And it's from here that the decrepit steam engine creaks into gear. It is, of course, the Civic Platform. It had been hoped to place a commemorative copy of the central lever at one end. But Hazel Blears put the kibosh on that with a series of threatening letters. diminutive and bumptious she may be but she or her officials can certainly write poisonous prose. The branch line volunteer who opens the post has been admitted to a clinic than numerous Phoenix and let's take into wandering the grounds in a daze like Ronald Coleman at the beginning of random harvest without the military uniform, of course, but with the pencil moustache. Anyway, off we go. The first stop some five hours down the line on a good day is blister lane. When I say on a good day, I mean on a day when the train doesn't sponsor to a halt about 20 yards out of hooting yard because the track is blocked by cows. This can happen distressingly often, for the field here about a teeming with cows, thousands of cows, and those they may be content to stand still staring at nothing. The likelihood is that mad old farmer frack will come bellowing and waving his stick and drive them back and forth across the railway line for his own no doubt profound purposes. He is not a farmer who can be bribed. So if he's doing his thing with the cows, the train just has to wait. For from blister lane we head on to Hoon, there are many who contend that Hoon is a place of myth like Atlantis or Lemuria even if they're right, and remember, there's no definitive evidence either way. That's no reason Hoon cannot have its own railway station. The station itself shimmers as if it missed even on a clear day and eerie sounds echo about its turrets and crenellations for the station building is both parroted and crenelated if blurry it is not advisable to disembark from the train at Hoon nor is it a good idea to alight at the next stop the horrible cave unless you're an emboldened spelunker Actually, there is a reasonable chance you may be so for last time we did a listenership survey. It turned out that almost three quarters of hooting yard listeners have survived terrifying impairment in caves, though not of course in the horrible cave itself. And it has to be said that the horrible cave is so horrible that it makes every other cave in any given subterranean system seemed like a prudence foxglove Sunday school.

The branch lawn volunteers refuse to place any health and safety notices at the stations, even here. So you'll have to keep your wits about you and use that unfashionable tool common sense. But if you're a regular listener to hooting yard, you will of course have plenty of that. And so we steam on still creaking to the macabre village. Please note that this is not the macabre yet goofy village you may have read about in the works of john Claude Enugu nor the same writers goofy but mccobb village, those are fictional. This is just a macabre village. With no goofiness to be found, however hard you might search. If you jump off the train here, try not to go too close to any of the buildings and take a torch with you, the more powerful the better. In fact, take a torch and a bag of pebbles. You can throw the pebbles at anything macabre that looms out of the shadows intent upon attacking you. Anybody with any sense will have stayed on the train and be rewarded by arriving some hours later at the ponds. This used to be a popular destination for picnicking parties, particularly the pond known as stagnant, Inky, black fathomless spooky pond, where generations of tinies cavorted and capered some of them even made it home alive. From the pons, it's a short hop to Pang Hill, where the famous orphanage graveyard is well worth a visit. Take a cotton napkin to mop up your tears. Various mawkish pamphlets are available from the graveyard gift shop, including some insufferably dreary collections of verse by Dennis beer pint penned, as he would say, before his reinvention as a 21st century beatnik. On that point, it appears that our cherished poet has disavowed his earlier work. He issued some kind of manifesto the other day, declaring that he intends to rewrite each and every one of his pre beatnik poems in the beatnik style. Whether or not that's something to look forward to. I'm not sure, it might be a good idea to snap up as many of his tweet verses as you can while you're at Pang Hill, if you can seat sobbing and do a Winslow t gather. The next stop is pointy town. The station is of course magnificent and very pointy. Indeed, it's thought to be the point here first railway station on the planet. Before reopening the branch line, the volunteers made a special effort to eradicate any blunt bits on the station concourse using a sort of anti sandpaper supplies of which they found untouched in a basement storeroom of hoomans, the gorgeous department store and so finally to the benighted fishing village itself, oh hooligans Wharf. For obvious reasons, the timetables are less act less than accurate, but you should arrive within two or three weeks of setting out from hooting yard. You will be exhausted and your head will be enveloped in steam, but you will I hope, experience I love crafty and shudder as you step onto the platform with the sudden hideous realization that there is no way back and you will spend the rest of your days trudging up and down the rotting jetty befouled sea water sloshing against your boots and squalls blowing in from the west.

Um, The following is a is a letter that I posted on the hooting aisle website that are received after that piece about the branch line appeared and it's a letter from Vladimir Elliot foxglove In his piece on the hooting yards that oh hula hoops, Wharf branch lawn, Mr. Key at one point tries to emphasize the horribleness of the horrible cave by suggesting that quote, it makes every other cave seem like a prudent foxglove Sunday school. Unquote. were meant I think to gasp and gore, but the fourth of the contrast Well, I for one, do not. I am prudence foxgloves grandson, I was both a pupil and later an instructor in her Sunday schools. What I know which Mr. Key clearly does not is that each and every one of my grandma's religious and moral education hubs were situated in a deep and dark and dank and damp and gloomy cave. This makes a nonsense of Mr. Keyes attempted a vivid contrast. My grandma decided to set up a network of Sunday schools because she was much troubled by the moral dereliction she witnessed all around her. In a letter to the football Ace, known as the daisy cutter Steve bloomer 1874 to 1938 she listed some of the things she had seen on a weekend outing. I saw a grave digger with an unwaxed moustache, a butcher without a hat, a tiny cadet loitering near a bordello an urchin with rickets whistling in the presence of a widow, a tippity fellow manipulating things, a wrench in the gutter, a paper just on the loose, and I saw much else besides. convinced that the nation's moral resurgence could only be affected by brainwashing every five year old in the land, prudence foxglove fell under the spell of the pedagogue Walter mad. Mad is best known today fears involvement in a curious postage stamp scandal, but it ought not be forgotten that he was the author of dozens and dozens of tracks. The one that compelled my grandmother's sent attention being an essay upon the brainwashing of five year olds through a system of pedagogy conducted within the confines of dank and gloomy caves. My grandma went to meet Walter mad to discuss his ideas. The man was an athletic and obviously a most powerful reflection. on his face, he carried more than one large glazed cicatrix that assisted the savage expression of malignity, impressed by nature upon his features, and his matted black hair, with its elf locks, completed the picturesque effect of a face that proclaimed in every lineament a reckless abandonment to cruelty and ferocious passions. prudence herself for familiar as she was with the faces of pedagogical Mad Men, in the dreadful hours of sack and Carnage, recoiled for one instance, from this hideous ravine, who had not even the palliation of youth in his favor, for he seemed 50 at the least. But appearances as we know can be deceptive. And Walter mad was all bonhomie and good cheer, or beard of a stern Protestant kidney, and not remotely, the Rafi and reminiscent of a minor character in Thomas de Quincey cluster Haim or the mask 1832, who so strongly if not exactly resembled my grandma was astonished at the scale of the pedagogues ambition. They had a vision of a vast network of caves, where tinies would be entrapped from their fifth birthday is onwards, learning by rote a curriculum of decisive moral rectitude. She fretted, however, that Walter mad seemed quite oblivious of the impracticality of his project. She fired questions at him, to which we had no answers save an airy wave of his arrestingly hairy hand. Had he sent out a scouting party of spelunkers to identify caves suitable for his purpose? conversely, was it his intention to employ a gang of geologists familiar with explosives? to blast brand new caves were now stood on a grim forbidding rock. How would he propel the Chinese into his caves? Did he see himself acting as a sort of Pied Piper of Hamelin figure? Was he not concerned that so prolong the stay in the capitalist gloom would ruin the sight of the Chinese and render many of them almost blind?

Frank Key  24:36
prudence swept away from their meeting convinced that Walter mad was a nutcase and a sinister one that she wondered if he had more in common with the cluster, Haim Rafi, and then she had at first supposed, I'm not sure if you ever learned of his later involvement in that postage stamp business, but had she done so she would have felt to some extent vindicated in her decision when she already arrived home to make a wax and doll of Walter mad and to stick it with pins with many, many pins. But my Grandma, grandma saw too that beneath all the weirdness, there was a grain of sense in his cave based education hub scheme. His plans were too lavish too grandiose, but reined in and properly organized. They could she thought, usher in a transformation in civic life. It was this insight that made her rather than Walter mad, the true visionary. She wrote her own version of Matt's tract entitled an essay upon the brainwashing of five year old through a system of pedagogy conducted within the confines of dank and gloomy caves, but only on Sundays, and threw herself into making it a reality. She took on an assistant, a man even more like the close to home, Rafi, and then Walter mad. This fellow's name was Ed Balls. Incidentally, though, as far as I know, he was unrelated to the current government minister. Balls sought out apt caves, kitted them out with Sunday school furniture and equipment and appointed Tweedy, bespectacled types to teach the tinies allowing prudence foxglove to concentrate on devising the curriculum, much of which was devoted to the more alarming passages in the Old Testament with a leavening of tweed drivel about fluffy animals and pretty flowers and submarine warfare. two generations of five year olds were brainwashed at my grandma's Sunday schools, and it's an experience none of them for God. Ed Balls, as we know, turned out to be a less than competent Judge of caves. For one by one they suffered collapses or flooding or seismological trauma until no trace of prudence foxgloves magnificent obsession remained. In closing, my eyes say what a fantastic time I've had writing this piece for hooting yard. And should I be invited to contribute again, I have a cupboard full of articles ready to publish, including several about beatniks one about the shoveling of agricultural waste materials and a potted biography of a balls. Not my grandma's assistant, but the new one, the government minister.

Frank Key  27:52
That's the end of this week shooting on the air. I do hope you've enjoyed it three pieces of morally uplifting prose. If Ed Balls is listening, I do think you're a very very astounding government minister and supremely talented, just like Andy Burnham bye bye
