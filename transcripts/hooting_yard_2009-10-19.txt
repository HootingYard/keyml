is indeed time for hooting yard. Welcome listeners. My name is Frankie. And this is The Ballad of Sopwith Tim. He came in asop with his goggles were tight. He landed among us in dawn's early light. Oh say can you see him in the airfield canteen, telling us of all the places he's been witness and Wivenhoe a village called splat the latter's in Cornwall, but I'm sure you know that top nasm top German snodland and Lu places without proper airfields to his goggles are still fastened to tight around his head as we hang on to every word he has said. We wonder how long he is going to stay in our pitiful village. So out of the way, he is trumping his breakfast with gusto and vim. He tells us that his name is Tim. Whatever became of Sopwith Tim, not a trace remains of him. Tragically, his fate was sealed when he came down in that airfield. How could he have known of the villagers last for burying under soil and mark and dust the corpses of strangers who ate their fill in the sinister canteen on top of the hill. He landed in the airfield and walked up the tour. In his goggles he passed through the canteen door. He told them his tales of venturesome flight until the poisonous breakfast put out his lights, like chopped into pieces and buried his bones and covered his grave with mysterious cones. Then they smashed up the software and sold it for scrap. You won't find that village on any known map.

My mother had a 10 year and a voice like a corncrake. In spite of these shortcomings, she saw it as her maternal duty to teach me a number of songs. I don't think she hoped that one day I might have bouquets thrown at me as I took a bow upon the Opera House stage, it was merely that she felt the ability to sing songs was a necessary social accomplishment, like having good table manners, or making small talk with riffraff. It was on the day after my sixth birthday that mark announced her intentions. I was happily sprawled on the floor, playing with a steak and a lump of coal, when she switched into my nursery through the butcher's drapes, grabbed me by the wrist and hold me off to what she henceforth called the music room. This was actually one of the pantries in which she had cleared space for her spinette. She began in appropriately by teaching me the four last songs of Richard Strauss. These were quite a challenge for a six year old who spoke no German and was accompanied not by an orchestra, but by a cat candidly, tinkled spinette and much aggression. For Christ's sake Arpad Mar would shout, try harder, or I will set the grumpy man on you. The precise nature of the grantee man had never been explained to me. But like all six year olds, I was terrified often, Mark did let slip that his awful rages could be soothed by song, and I believed her. Indeed, I still do so many years later. Mar has long been in her grave, and her little art pad has grown old and frail. But I never crawl into my bed at night without putting out a saucer of sewage and marzipan to placate the grantee man should he smashed his way into my chalet as midnight strikes. When he removes the treats from the saucer, the pressure knob concealed beneath it will click up an activated gramophone player and the fearsome creature will be lowered by the dulcet tones of Dame Nellie Melba crackling from a 78 when I had mastered the four last songs to Mars satisfaction, we moved on to Dr. Bogan broom. This is a 1971 song by Jethro towel, not one of their better known pieces, and one which Curiously, I found far harder to learn than this. Strouse. Much of the difficulty was due to the fact that Maher was now accompanying me on a Wheezy and Mathieson sack but an instrument with which she showed even less proficiency than the spinet. Our family factotum mango of car Pacey and peasant stock had grown fearful of the sound of the spinet after a series of nightmares and had thrown it down a well, my resolve to change the locks on all the pantry doors and to banish mango to the garden. He made himself a yogurt as shelter against the snow, for this was a time of great howling blizzards. In the evenings from my nursery window, I would hear mango singing away. He had a deep and booming voice and sang the car piscean ditties remembered from his childhood, but Maher said they were abominations and nailed fast the shutters on my windows there after the silence was broken only by my own relentless practicing over and over again of Dr. Bogan broom. It took me many months to crack it, but I did. As a reward. Mark gave me a new lump of coal to play with the other one had crumbled, so I've been tapping my stick upon the floor or upon the shell of mangoes taught us I did not have much play time though, because my insisted I next learn essays on pigs by Hans Verner, hence, difficult, brutal and shouty. These five settings of the poem by gassed on Salvatore suited me perfectly. And in a matter of days I had them down pat. In fact, I learned them before mango had finished repairing the spinet Mar had pushed him down the well and made him fetch the various broken fragments then locked him in a linen cupboard with a hammer and pliers and nails until he put the instrument back in one piece. She hated the sack but

as did I and we both looked forward to the day she could bash out her witlessly arranged accompaniments upon the spinet once more, but mango was a slow worker and almost a year passed before he was done. During this time, it was my job to feed his tortoise and I became very familiar with curly kale and lettuce to my measurable benefit in later life. I fear I'm gonna pass in silence over the next stage in my song singing education. For it's too painful to recollect. Maher somehow got it into her head to teach me drink tea everyone the waters of his own system until I come and take you away. The single and singular song written by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson I learned it. I sang it. I can still sing it. But it gives me no pleasure to do so. And it frightens even the cricket in my heart. I'll tell you about them another time by the way. Her spinet now restored Marta pedagogic impulses were about. By the time since bibley, babe day came around. She had taught me Keiko leader Nina roll along covered wagon, all 114 songs in the collection published by Charles Ives in 1922. And the light pours out of me by magazine Kenya's I was to crack right on. It was on the eve of my patron saints day that I was felled by an au I lost the use of my limbs was rendered half blind and could only croak pitifully. Now ma had no truck with the medical profession, relying instead on mangoes befuddled and I suspect inaccurate memories of car piscean peasant nostrums. most if not all of these seemed to involve gunkan fluid drain from the gallbladder of his tortoise and the chanting of jibberish at my bedside. I cannot say it for how it contributed to my recovery from the AU. But the chanting certainly had a profound effect on Ma. I have said that she had a voice like a corncrake. Now if you began to behave like one, after listening wrapped to Mongo, she would lop off across the fields, so the edge of screwin hunahpu farm and hide in the wheat, gobbling down insects and seeds and chutes and frogs. As I got better, and my sight returned. I noted that when sitting at my bedside, she was furiously missing herself a pair of woolen wings. By the time of my seventh birthday, I was fit as a fiddle. I jumped out of bed and scampered to the pantry, keen to begin work on this Have investment capital overseas by the art bears and more than a feeling by Boston, MA had given me to understand that these two songs would complete my repertoire, and with them under my belt, I would never be at a loss to entertain sophisticated people at cocktail parties for the rest of my life. But when I pushed open the pantry door, I was met with a sight so traumatic that it meant I would never become the sort of person with easy manners and social dash, who received invitations to cocktail parties. Mango was keening his definition Carpathian peasant chant, and applying a poultice made from his tortoise, his gallbladder Guru tomorr, who was in case from head to toe in a corncrake suit made of wool. She in her turn, was calling cracks, cracks, cracks, over and over again. of the spinet there was no sign. I never did learn to sing those two songs. Over the following year, Mar tried all in her power to turn me into a corncrake chick. I was forbidden to sing anything at all, even the essay on pigs. My stick and my lump of coal were cast into a dustbin and my time was split between hiding in the wheat and being counted out by mango in the pantry. God knows what would have happened had fate not intervened. Shortly before my eighth birthday, mango was called up by the Carpathian peasant Army Reserve and returned to his homeland. We waved him off from the station. He left his taught us with me for safekeeping. It lives with me still, and I feed it on curly kale and lettuce. But I have never drained a drop of fluid from its gallbladder. Ma eventually came to her senses and shed her corncrake ways. But she never taught me any more songs.

Every now and then, I come across a piece of writing so magnificent that I consider packing in this whole business. You know, I get this feeling WHY, WHY continue tapping away and reading this stuff out when, when true genius stalks the land. And it can crop up in the most unexpected places. A few weeks ago, in the observer, the observer magazine or one of the one of the sections in the observer, Mariella Frostrup does a sort of agony armed column. And this is one of the letters that were sent her. Of course being an agony and seeing it's unsigned, so you don't know who wrote it, but whoever wrote this, the man is a genius. Dear Mariela, I have had a long time interest in beekeeping. Unfortunately, I have a mortal fear of bees, and similar stinging insects, and neither my partner nor I enjoy the taste of honey, rendering the material benefit of keeping bees somewhat moot. I have read a great deal of books on the subject, and have yet to determine just why I am so fascinated by this most peculiar hobby, though I do quite enjoy watching beekeepers remove the honeycomb frame from an apiary as I find it quite relaxing. It has got to the point where it's affecting my marriage, as my partner is entirely unsympathetic to what she describes as an obsession. I tend to spend most evenings reading a theorist manuals and commenting on beekeeping forums on the internet, to the detriment of our sex life. I am interested in sex, but at this point, I'm more interested in bees. Is this kind of relationship normal? How can I bring my partner around to enjoying my interest in beekeeping with me

Frank Key  15:02
So I, whether that letter was meant seriously or not, I do think it's genius. I'm interested in sex, but at the moment I'm more interested in bees. When ghouls attack, there are certain precautions the sensible householder can take to avoid permanent dis arrangement of the senses. ghouls will oftentimes take you into their kill, embrace and grip ghastly Ecto plasm from their extremities. This can be such a disgusting experience that your nerves will be designed before you even have time to shout. Allahu Akbar, or some similar appeal to a deity. Not that calling upon any god. Not even some of the Aztec ones will do you much good with a ghoul on the attack. By and large ghouls are godless and have no concept of spiritual fervor or fear. Being semi transparent and insubstantial. They're also regrettably impervious to being beaten with shovels or fire tongs. How then, can you defend yourself and your loved ones against their malign implacability? And I'm going to read you now some tips from a pamphlet recently issued by the government's newly appointed Google's are a flamboyant ping pong technique unnerves most ghouls. Practice relentlessly even on the day of rest. ghouls hate syrup, keep plenty of tinge in your pantry. A lopsided cake stand artfully placed on the dresser will throw a ghoul into a quandary. If you have a pond, keep a pet Swan recital of Sylvia Plath poems can send goals back to the netherworld from which they emerged. But never ever whisper a word from the works of Ted huge in their presence. slack jawed farmhands can be positioned between you and a ghoul to stave it off. If you're staying in a Google haunted guesthouse insist on having a trapdoor in your room. Spray the air with essence of toffee apple, or Nate stippled. Either duck decor baffles the keenest guru and anxious demeanor will behove you well. Bear in mind that there is no known defense against the Brechtian goal. Like right horses, ghouls can be nobbled this prevent any mystery in the first place. And I posted that on the hooting yard website and in return I received from keen hooting yard reader out a Spaceman sent me a photograph of a packet of toffee apples sausages, and asked will they protect me when goals attack? Indeed they will. To be more precise, they will actually deter any attack. The last point in the government ghouls RS handy checklist refer to the preventative measure of Nobbling a ghoul so it's incapacitated from launching an attack in the first place. toffee apples sausages are absolutely perfect for this purpose. I need hardly explain why ghouls are similar simultaneously attracted and repelled by this combinatory foodstuff. You don't even need to open the packet. Simply take a source from your crockery cupboard and place it on the floor as you might do if intending to treat your cat to some milk. Instead of pouring milk into the salsa however, just place the packet of toffee apples, sausages on it on opened and go about your business, whatever that business might be. Whether it's pickling the tiny bones of a rain or rearranging your collection of vendors soccer coupons in their leather band our leather bound album. When a ghoul comes a shimmering and a groaning into your homestead, it will be lured by the toffee apple sausages and hunka over the saucer befuddled one cannot speak of its brain being discombobulated for goals do not have brains as such. Whatever that hideous insubstantial blob nestling within it ghastly head may be, it is not a brain. But the blob will throb in the presence of toffee apples sausages, and if the goal lingers long enough over the saucer, its head blob will either shrivel or explode, depending on what category of google it is. The one thing it will not be able to do is to summon the wherewithal to launch an attack. will have been successfully nobbled

there is much else that can be said about the commingling of sausage and toffee apple quite irrespective of goals, but now I have to go and make a few changes to my exquisite hand drawn map of blanket by the Blears.

Having crossed sawdust bridge follow black pudding basin lane until it Peters out into a dirt track. Carry on past the clump of Aspen's and the inevitable cows and as the land suddenly slopes down towards the sea, veer slightly to the right. If there is no mist you may you may be able to see the crag but there is usually a mist when you get to the crag clamber up to the top of it. This is where the king sat either looking out to sea or looking back at his kingdom from its edge. It hardly mattered in which direction he looked for the mist was usually so thick that he could hardly see beyond his nose when he sat on the crag. Where is the king? The Chamberlain used to cry sweeping from room to room through the palace. Terrifying his underlings. The king is on his crag. One would eventually reply. The Chamberlain cursed and kicked things and threw pebbles at furniture, and then he sent a page to control the king down from the crag. There were one or two pages who had dazzling persuasive skills. One it was said could coax a leech off a leg as easily as he might puff draft from a cell. But the king could cling to his crag with the strength of 20 kings. In the midst it was easy enough for a page to lose his footing and to topple into the sea. Often within the boom and seas of waves upon the rocks might be heard the thud and splash of a fallen page. The Chamberlain employed a gang to mop blood from the rocks, the sea would have washed the gore away in time, but the trembling was a pernickety and deficient man. That was why he had been chosen. Sometimes, a mop man might be promoted to page. Ooh, you can see what's coming. And so of course, did the mop man turned page I have mocked the blood of pages from the rocks will soon enough have my own blood mock from the rocks, wrote one the day before the Chamberlain sent him to persuade the king to leave his crag and return to the palace and rain. The King though, rained from his crag, engulfed in sea mist as gold shrieked.

Mango was the name of the family factotum in songs my mother taught me. But there's also Uber Mongo hooting yards terrifically lifelike, artificial brain built out of dough and string and wax and coat hangers and process trees triangles and Fig Newtons and titanium. And every week from now on, it will answer listeners questions. Dear Uber mango, I am a flapper. When I flap with two great enthusiasm my cloth hat becomes dislodged. What advice would you give? That's from poopy clean, clean? Well, poopy if you glue your hat to your head with a proprietary hat headed he says future dislodgement will be rarer than our Beano Stalinists and you can flap the night away to your heart's content. Dear Uber Mongo, whatever the name of God is a new Tube Rank PV babe wait while my interview process the question PV do Uber mango yesterday. I tied a yellow ribbon round on old oak tree. Today I'm searching for the hero inside myself. Tomorrow I'm thinking it might be a good idea to find out if my friends are electric. Are any of these activities valid? Stephen Fry? Stephen No, they're not go and boil your head. There Uber mango, who won the FA Cup Final in 1968 Bathsheba gubbins misses. My innards are still worrying and buzzing away at PV bibs question Mrs gubbins, but the answer is something like West Bromwich nopalea you may wish to check that did Uber mango, shortly after taking part in the Tet Offensive, I was sitting on a balcony in a foreign capital city where my attention was drawn ineluctably to a toad sitting on a neighboring balcony. Like many toads, it had a jewel embedded in its head, a jewel that glittered so brightly, it was visible through the toads, translucent green skin. My balcony was covered with an awning. So when a violent rainstorm began, I was untroubled, but the toads balcony had no warning. And despite it amphibious nature, the toad appeared disconcerted by the rain, and it hopped away out of my sight. The thing is, in the years that followed, I've been haunted by that brief vision, and more particularly unmoored from peace and reason, by my ignorance of precisely what sort of precious stone was lodged in the head of the toad. If I were to draw with a pencil from memory, a sketch showing the way the soon to be expanded sunlight glisten through the skin upon the jewel, the angles it cast, the tints and textures of the light, do you think you might be able to ascertain whether it was, say, a Ruby or an emerald or an amethyst? That's from Phnom Penh vet, the vet all would depend on the skill with which you will the pencil, you should also bear in mind that I am a mere artificial brain and have no eyes and thus cannot see. And that's the end of this week's hooting yard. Those questions if you have any questions for Uber, mango, the artificial brain, send them in. And I'm not going to be here for the next two weeks. I'm taking a rare, a rare holiday, very rare holiday, but I'll be away for two weeks. So there'll be repeats. And I'll be back in three weeks. So yeah, bye
