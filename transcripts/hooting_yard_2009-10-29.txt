Good evening resonance 104 point four FM or online at www dot resonance fm.com I think. And this is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key. I had a hammer. I hammered in the morning, I hammered in the evening all over this land. I hammered out danger. I hammered out a warning. I hammered out love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land. Like should have seen that coming. As I said, before I hammered the love out of them. I hammered out a warning, it was hardly my fault if they saw God wishes for locking about. Personally, if I had seen one of my siblings roaring towards me at dusk armed with a hammer, I'd have made a run for it. Particularly when it was clear, I had been hammering things all day, all over this land. Anyway, I had a good night's sleep. And the next day I continued hammering, there was not much left to hammer in this land. So I crossed the border. I hammered the fence and the border guards. And then I had a happy day hammering everything that lay in my path in this new country. Bang, bang, bang. That was me with the occasional doll thump if I hammered something soft and squishy. I didn't discriminate if I saw it, I hammered it. It really was as simple as that. But then I was fortunate to have such a good hammer. When my hammering was still in the planning stages. It was suggested to me that I should obtain a silver hammer from Maxwell's for sure, I said, I actually said sure, like a character in a bad play from the interwar years. But I was right to do so. Maxwell's silver hammer was fashionable enough in its time. But the kind of hammering I intended to do required something sturdier a real Thumper. So I got my hammer from Huberman. I was so pleased with it that I hammered my way out of the shop and didn't stop hammering until I got home. It was the following day that I started to hammer all over this land. Then, the day after that, I hammered my way halfway across the neighboring land. It was much bigger and much more densely packed with people and things. So I had a lot more hammering to do than in my own land. But eventually, I got to the frontier, having hammered pretty much everything in sight. As I nestled down for the night in a border chalet. I inspected my hammer, and was pleased to see that it was almost as good as new. There were a couple of scuff marks and quite a lot of blood. But otherwise, it looked as if it would serve me well for as long as I continued hammering all over as many lands as I descended upon like an angel of death with my hammer.

Pete Seeger didn't write that apparently. Excuse me. The other day, I popped into the town hall to find out a bit about bins, park benches, signage, flowerbeds and civic statuary. I think it's time to engage more fully with the maintenance of my bailiwick, and the municipal doings there in. This impulse was prompted when sitting on a park bench next to a civic statue of the much missed alderman Spandau, alongside which was a been in which weeds hold from a flower bed had been chucked. I read a sign placed there by the Council, which implored me and I suppose anybody else who read it to refrain from smoking within the precinct of the park to tidy up after my dog, though I did not have a dog as such, to ensure I paid my Council Tax promptly, and to place any litter I wish to discard in the been provided. Each of these instructions or pieces of advice or commands, or whatever we might call them, was translated into several languages. It was a bloody big piece of signage. Incidentally, for those of you attune to the resonances of the color spectrum, the bench was brown, the statue was gray with patches of green, the bin was black, and the weeds weirdly were gash, golden million, I wouldn't have put them in the bin, I would have taken them home and arranged them in a vase and placed it on my mantle piece. If I had a mantle piece, the sign itself was beige with the writing in red. If I had to be more precise, I would say it was blood red. I did not at the time understand why this might be significant. If I had either a dog or a mantel piece, I might not have been so quick to visit the town hall. Both would have claims on my attention. I would have to take the dog for walkies and shop for biscuits and give it bath and possibly take it to the vet for injections from time to time. As for a mantel piece that would need dusting I suppose. And minor upkeep such as the patching up of crumbly bits if it was rotting, and also much time spent in judicious contemplation of items to display upon it, and the arrangement there of those two would have to be dusted in addition to the mantel piece itself if I were to avoid becoming engulfed by dust, and thus have trouble with my breathing apparatus one day, but unencumbered as I was by both dog and mantlepiece. When I held myself out of bed that morning, I was free to go along to the town hall without other duties to distract me.

I know nothing of architecture, but by God I recognize municipal pride expressed in brick and concrete when I see it. I must have walked past the town hall numberless times without paying any attention. Now I stopped on the steps to take in its majestic frontage. Gosh, feeling somewhat belittled, I entered through the grand doorway. I did not have an appointment with anybody. So when I presented myself at the reception desk, I was treated with a certain disdain. Perhaps I was mistaken for a mendicant I suppose I ought to have washed my hair and worn or less grubby cravat for what I considered a pretty momentous visit. I was pointed towards a row of plastic chairs and told to sit and wait. Before taking my seat. I browse through a rack of leaflets affixed to the wall and took a few of them to pass the time. Coincidentally, the very first one I read, concerned alderman Spandau, whose statue I had sat beside in the park, I learned that his title of alderman had no civic significance. But they that he had been so cool, because he was an expert, albeit an amateur one on the subject of all the trees with which the park was riddled. I learned too, that an enthusiasm for trees ran in the family, and that he had a cousin who also bought the name of a German prison, who was known as Sycamore man. Fascinating as always was it had nothing to tell me of bins and park benches and signage and flower beds, or civic statuary in general. So I took the leaflet into an inner pocket for safekeeping and turned my attention to the next one in my clutch. It was all about food poisoning. Again, not my immediate concern, though I noted it managed to work in a mention of alderman Spandau claiming his death had been due to the unwise ingestion of several contaminated eggs on toast. There was no reference to his cousin, although yet another German prison was alluded to, for reasons which I could not quite pin down. I replaced this leaflet in the rack. As I was doing so a council person emerged from behind a panel and approached me his hand held out in greeting.

Seldom have I bet held such glistening buttons. This council person gave off a powerful reek of spam and hair oil, but I was impressed by his politics. As he led me up staircases and along corridors towards his office. He explained that following a rash of complaints about surliness and the grumps, the municipal authorities had trained their entire workforce in the manners and morals of the Imperial Court of Austria Hungary, circa 1844. This had worked wonders in what he nevertheless termed the public interface skill set. I couldn't help thinking what alderman Spandau would have made of it all. But then I remembered that he was merely a tree enthusiast rather than a civic dignitary. I haven't looked into the matter, but I assume that the word dignitary comes from the same route as dignity. This was a quality singularly lacking, I'm afraid to say, among the members of the current council administration, a framed photograph of who was prominently displayed on the wall of the office into which I was led. They were pictured together in a field lined up as if they were a sports team, and each had a glassy eyed stare. Each of the more unfortunate Cagoule, I noticed there was a dog mercifully unka Gould in the front row, and asked joshing Li it's to was a counselor, or just a mascot. To my surprise, the council person replied that the dog Skippy by name was actually the mayor of our bailiwick, it had won more votes than all the other councillors put together. The rest of them are a complete shower, he said brightly, but needs must when the devil drives. I observed that Skippy apart, they all looked as if they had had their brains removed, let us say, modified, he replied. intriguing as this revelation was, I didn't want to waste time talking about the councillors. I put it to the council person, that I was ready and willing to contribute manfully, and with gusto, to all matters pertaining to bins and park benches and signage and flower beds and civic statuary. But before I could do so I needed to know more about them all. He made a great show of buffing his buttons with a silken corsetry and said, Oh, I wouldn't worry your little potato shaped head about such things. Skippy has everything under control. Though reassured in terms of the maintenance of civic order, I was somewhat deflated, was there no way I protested that I could play the part of an active citizen. I passed over the comment about the shape of my head, for I did not think it had been meant unkindly. And after all, my head is on the small side, and it resembles a potato. This is often remarked upon by people, but usually at times when conversation has fallen flat, and they're desperately trying to think of something to say, the council person had no such problem. Indeed, he began babbling a stream of what I took to be boilerplate municipal jargon. It was unremittingly opaque, and he must have noticed my eyes glazing over for suddenly he grabbed me by the elbow and ushered me towards the window. There, he shouted, pointing. That's what I'm talking about the municipal monkey pound. I looked, and sure enough, just past the carpark and the clump of all the trees, there was a pound and it was full of monkeys. at ground level, you would never have recognized it. But from a high window up here in the Civic Imperium. There was no mistaking it. I was wrapped. Explain it to me again. This time without the jargon. I said. This, it seemed It was too much to ask. He insisted I would get the hang of things, plopped a cap on my head and pinned a badge to my lapel. Five minutes later, we were outside at the electronic gate of the monkey pound and he was pressing a buzzer. Ah, Sheva mix. He said as a civic functionary emerged from a heart to open the gate. Here is our new volunteer. And I was in I was doing my bit for the council, not as I had hoped to in the realm of bins and park benches and signage and flowerbeds and civic statuary. But nonetheless, I had my foot in the door. I was an active civically minded citizen. chevin X, the monkey pound supervisor

proved to be the most unfailingly helpful person I have ever met in any capacity. He gave me a brush to read my volunteers cat have accumulated filth, and a rag to polish my volunteers badge. And he took me on a guided tour of the monkey pound and told me more about it than any sane person could wish to know. Quite unbeknown to me, our baileywick had been plagued for some years by monkeys, and not just any monkeys, but monkey vampires. These were qualitatively different from vampire monkeys I was given to understand, but I'm hazy on the details, and Sheva Nick's soon passed on to other matters. The monkey vampires had all been rounded up from their nests and hiding places in kennels and deer vents and pavilions. And were impounded here in the pound behind the carpark and the clump of all the trees pending a decision on whether or not they should be subject to extraordinary risks. addition, Skippy was mulling it over, but it was low on his list of priorities. Some of those in the note wanted all the monkey vampires to be put in a sealed train, like Lenin and take them to the Carpathians. Others prefer the idea of ferrying the monkey vampires one by one to havens. There was even a body of opinion suggesting they be kept in the municipal monkey pound in perpetuity. chevin ex did not divulge to me which, if any of these opinions had his backing, I suppose that as a functionary, he had to remain neutral. The monkey vampires themselves were fascinating, at least when visible. The Pound was constructed with many Trump lay gardenia, bushes, mazes, baffles and cubbies. And it was possible to walk round and round for hours without seeing a single customer, as the council insisted on calling the impounded monkey vampires. Sam, I was told we're velveteen and thrashed about in the darkness, others through pickle jars over the fence. When the moon was full, there was cleaning. The smell was a mixture of gnats, blood and marzipan and bilgewater crocus's real ones grew in patches here and there, and sometimes very tiny, almost transparent monkey vampires could be seen sucking moisture from the band's chevin x had a sack stuffed with aerosol sprays, which he made judicious use of several of the monkey vampires had learned to count and were reportedly devising their own calendar. It could be noticed that no birds ever flew over the pound, with the exception of startled chaffinches. On a log, a pot of paint with a much dented lid acted as a newer. One of my fellow volunteers, a bedraggled harpy of advancing years was in charge of Brazil nuts. I have to be given my own little sphere of influence one day, I have not been home since I got here. I sleep in a hammock in the corner of one of the mazes and do my ablutions in the paddling pool. I feed on Brazil nuts left unattended by the Harpy and suck moisture from crocus's. One thing shevin x did not tell me was that the municipal monkey pound was built on the side of a pauper's graveyard. I discovered this for myself by a combination of sharp wits and cemetery area addition, I have noticed unseemly traffic between the monkey vampires and the spirits of long dead paupers. It's going on all the time at a lopsided angle for common perception. My quandary is whether to tell chevin X or the council person, or even Skippy

there was very briefly mention of the car pisceans in that piece. And on that subject, car pisceans stick potato and sausage soup is a delicious soup from the car pisceans perfect for those long winter evenings. As darkness falls and the temperature plummets and a chill set into your bones. It is very simple to make. Basically, you just boil up a pan of potatoes and sausages and add a suitable coagulant when it's thick enough for your iron spoon to stand up in it unsupported. Tip the whole lot into a bowl and garnish with the horns of a goat or two that added crunch. In the past entire Carpathian families lived off this soup for years on end. It's true that in some cases they suffered from nutritional difficulties and had many ructions with the Carpathian goat herding community. But we live in a different age and can put such unpleasantness behind us. There is no benefit whatsoever in reviving ancient Carpathian blood feuds, although of course, to do so can enliven and otherwise dull week if you are worried by the prospect of a gang of Carpathian peasants Hoving interview, armed with flaming torches and pitchforks call our helpline our staff has been fully well adequately trained in Carpathians tech potato and sausage soup dispute resolution techniques, and they will not hang up if they hear you screaming for mercy.

quite some time ago, a year or so, maybe I did a piece about the folk song all around my hat. There's a famous version by steeleye span, but it's it's an old English folk song all around my hand. Anyway, today I want to attend to its close cousin, all around somebody else's hat. Strictly speaking, this is not a song so much it's a dance with chanting. The basic idea is that the participants first have to steal somebody's hat. any old tip for will do though Personally, I would recommend the sombrero or the trilby. Having picked the person whose hat they intend to use. The celebrants surround the victim and stun him or her with poisoned darts. They should be blowing through pipes or straws from close range, aim for the head, being careful of course, not to puncture the hat. Occasionally, when obtaining the hat on a busy street in an important metropolis, the collapse of the hat wear onto the pavement and their accompanying groans and feverish, panting as the toxins course through their veins can attract the attentions not only of passers by, but of police officers or community hub support patrol wardens. If this happens, dissemble, it can be helpful to point a flock of carrion crows in the sky, or to start up by loud and hideous collective jabbering both pointing at birds in the sky, while jabbering usually distract bumptious persons in uniform in most cities. Next, the gaggle of jabbering maniacs should carry these stolen hat off to their layer. This layer can be sited in a cave, or somewhere up in the hills, or at a pinch down on insalubrious alleyway within the city itself. How sulfur bombs at any interfering busybodies dim enough to give trace. Once in the layer, weeping with frenzy and festooned with feathers and necklaces of bones and teeth and in garden golden cloth. The dancers placed the hat in a puddle of brimstone surround it with stinky her bushes, clumps aligned in a pattern of esoteric significance, and begin to dance around it while chanting. The chant itself can vary, which makes it rather more interesting than the frankly solipsistic all around my hat. recent examples observed in the field, as they say, have included the incomprehensible hooba hooba goober nuber. The elitist ad price ends over crass Polish sons Melly ora add Kwame add quad and the riveting. partic sisal three Stenhouse meal, one after three or four days a night to van interrupted dancing and chanting. glimpses of the ineffable should swim into vision. These will be branded upon the brain. Later, when everybody has calmed down and taken influence, the hat can be plucked from its puddle and returned to its owner, who will almost certainly be found tied to a bed in the nearest clinic shaking uncontrollably and babbling inanities

proof at last they hope that that but, but even better, right, I'll start again, I'm going to have a tea. You talk among yourselves. Right. Let's begin again. Proof at last that hooting yards eco credentials are second to none. It's two and a half years since this program first raised the important issue of carbon hoofprints with reference article to vagrant goat God. Well, we were scorned and ridiculed. But now eventually, as I suspected would happen, the world has caught up with our visionary eco consciousness. And I was directed the other day to a new report, which I think is from some Swedish scientists. Anyway, want a quote from this report? new report says, Now I'm quoting from a real report here. The eco poor print of a pet dog is twice that of a 4.6 liter Land Cruiser, driven 10,000 kilometres a year, researchers have found I think the the general idea was that if you were going to keep a pet, it shouldn't be a dog. It should be a chicken or something like that. Anyway, our tireless endeavors to be the most eco superduper radio program in the universe continue our pace, even as I ride, Ernest, even as I speak, Ernest bitty bit sandaled Cassandra's are hard at work in the hooting yard eco pod tallying up stats on the carbon Talon prints of a crow, the flipper prints of sea lions and thrillingly the Eco sucker prints of various squelchy aquatic life forms.

Finally, this week, we've just got time for a quotation from the expedition of Humphry clinker by Tobias Smollett, published in 1771. My swooning was entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetida flew via upon nerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people's nerves are constructed, but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials to stand the shock of such a horrid assault. It was indeed a compound of villainous smells, in which the most violence stinks, and the most powerful perfumes contended for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a High Exalted essence of mingled odors arising from putrid gums, imposter mated lungs, sour flatulence ease rank armpits, sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments and embro cations, Hungary water spirit of lavender, Assa Fertitta drops, Musk hearts on and sour volatile. Besides 1000 frowny steams, which I could not analyze. Such Oh dick is the fragrant ether we breathe in the polite assemblies of bath, such as the atmosphere I have exchanged for the pure elastic animating air of the Welsh mountains. And that's all for this week. Bye bye
