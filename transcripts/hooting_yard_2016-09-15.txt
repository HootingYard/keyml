Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key This is hooting out on the air. And this week we're going to begin the show with some further science. Regular listeners will know that I like to read extracts from further science book 20 by Norman Davis, published in 2001, a spineless and quite possibly out of print pamphlet, my request my my my repeated requests for someone somewhere to send me copies of further science book one to 19 has so far fallen on deaf ears. I keep expecting to get a little package through the post, but I never do. If anyone listening knows where I can obtain further, further science books, please do let me know. Anyway, this is from further science book 20 by Norman Davis. And it's world flag psychology. One that stars occur mainly in Equatorial areas to the all read of the Soviet Union, China, Turkey, Morocco, is complimentary to the old desert area green of Africa, Arabia and North sorry, North Central Africa, Arabia and Brazil. Three, that Ethiopia equals Bolivia, for that Mexico equals Italy. Five. Now from the North Central African green access circle, to the south west and south east, there is green, red, yellow, six, while to the far southwest and Southeast is red and white. Seven, to the Western east of it is the red and yellow cross stripe, eight to the close Northwest and Northeast, they all read nine to the far northwest and northeast of it the black, red, white 10 to the semi northeast and northwest of it, the green, white, red 11 And likewise, from the Soviet China red core 12 to the northwest and northeast of it, the red and white to the southwest and southeast of it, the green, white, orange, etc, etc. 13 so that flags are not random choices at all, but follow strict color patterns directions. 14, which means the human psychology a base strict psychological laws with no deviance from such regardless of race, surely an important proof of human behavior. And we move from flag psychology to fly psychology. One, that when a rapid approach is made towards a settled fly, it will zoom off in ample time on every occasion, having a brain geared to the very fastest responses to but if a fly is settled on a dining table and a blade be held 18 inches above it, it remains settled. Three now if that blade gradually reduces height, it can come to only one inch above the neck of the fly without the house fly moving. For then a sudden movement of the blade will cut off the head of the fly without it stirring a muscle. ie a fly has no brain conception of slow motion.

Frank Key  04:53
Now I've got all the time in the world for Norman Davis. I think the man is all perhaps was a genius for writing 20 books or further science like that, but did he really cut the head off or fly with a knife? I mean, that seems a bit of a tall order. Anyway, if you'd like to try that at home, get a fly. Put it on your dining table, hold the blind 18 inches above its neck, and then gradually bring the knife down to within an inch of its neck. JOHN just said thorax, Norman Davis says it's a neck so I'm quite happy to go with Norman Davis. I still found the concept of cutting my head over fly. Very, very difficult to believe. But who knows? Anyway, something else now. The Legend of the smothered chicken of Greece elbow has been told and retold for over 1000 years. The core details seldom vary. In the rustic backwater of Greece elbow, a child, usually but not always and often is settling into its caught one wild and windy night when it senses an unusual lump under its pillow. Lifting the pillow that child finds a chicken often but not always a vanbrugh Chicken which has expired due to smothering the child picks up the chicken by one of its feet and caps it out of the bedroom window. The instant it is let go. The kickin springs to life are such a shrill squawk and hurtles heavenward. When the child returns to bed, it finds the pillow vanished, replaced by a large egg. But child climbs into the egg somehow, and the shell then closes around it. interpretations of the legend by folklorist have tended to concentrate on the egg and the child but have more interest is the smothered chicken. That is particularly the case if one has a penchant for poultry. And which of us does not. Well, you might counter there are plenty of people who don't give a fig about poultry. Even teen egg eaters who rarely let a breakfast go by without scuffing an egg or two might be utterly uninterested in the provenance of their egg. It asked poultry of one kind or another. This is a lamentable state of affairs. And is the reason I carry a pillow with me whenever I'm in the vicinity of someone eating eggs. Always I shout where did those eggs come from? Unless I receive a full and Frank reply, acknowledging the eggs origins. I bundle the egg eater to the ground and smother them with the pillow. Oh Lord, save us and protect us for weed No, not what we do. That was a Thought for the Day by the Reverend Cousteau Fandango Brack Victor pretenders of sudden Liberty did did.

Frank Key  08:39
That's actually a true legend. The Legend of the smothered chicken of Greece elbow. If you don't believe me look it up. As a child, I was rule never to sprinkle too many hundreds and thousands upon a fairy cake. Doing so I was told risked suffocating the fairies who invisibly skated upon the icing on top of the cake. For this reason, my infant nightmares were filled with desperate gasping fairies, gagging on tiny slivers of colored sugar before collapsing in the stillness of death. It seems obvious to me that the big fairy would seek to avenge the slaughter of the innocence because I was forever helping out in the kitchen, putting the finishing touches to the fairy cake baked by my mom. I was last in constant fear of the big fairy. My terror was increased by my presumption that like it young, the big fairy was invisible. How was I to know if it was lurking by the larder door armed with a fairy axe about to strike. Mark could not stop making fairy cakes. She had a sort of mamia it was encouraged by my pa who had an insatiable appetite. ravenously gobbling down the fairy cakes straight from the baking tray often before they had cooled as his teeth rotted and he grew ever fatter. I could not help thinking about all those dead fairies. He was interesting. He was a walking fairy graveyard. This thought at least helped me to deal with the threat of the big fairy. I assumed it would stay close to par, mourning its progeny, perhaps too emotionally distressed to summon the strength to wheel this fairy axe on might remain safe from the big fairy if I kept well away from par. This was easier said than done as we lived during my early childhood in a cramped hovel. Then one day, in a shaft of unaccountably bright sunlight creaming through the one Hubble window, I caught a glimpse of the big fairy. It was much bigger and more dhoti than I had suspected, and it was looming overpower a look of ravaged grief on it goatee countenance. There was no sign of the fairy axe. passing clouds obliterated the Sunbeam and the big fairy was once again invisible. But from that day, I felt pity for it not fear. Mark continue to bake fairy cake and park continue to scuff them until the inevitable happened. Past succumbed to a surfeit. It was a dismal first day when, by now toothless and impossibly fat he keeled over and lay prostrate on the kitchen floor. I knelt down next to him and took his hand. He opened his mouth, trying to utter his last words, but no sound came instead, fluttering out of his mouth, and crowding the air, poured a throng of ghost fairies, visible embossed my heart saying, then ma went to work with a flyswatter.

A couple of weeks ago, I received a request from the great Norman Sherman of the drabblecast, you may recall his voice normally produces the strange fiction podcast from somewhere somewhere in the east of the US. And apparently the drabblecast speaking of the drabblecast for years, I thought it had something to do with modern travel. And I wonder if there was also an as Biet cast produced by her sister, but neither of those things is true. Anyway, the drabblecast is shortly going to be doing an HP Lovecraft special fact they apparently they do one of these every year. And this year, norm asked me to contribute with a kind of lovecraftian story. So in order to do that, I kind of reminded I immersed myself for a while in reading HP Lovecraft before then writing my lovecraftian piece, and which hasn't been broadcast yet. I'm not sure when the drama cast is doing the podcast, but I will make sure you know, so you can listen to the story which is called Mr. Key goes to in the mouth. And anyway, so I bought some immersed in HP Lovecraft after this little kind of days of reading and writing that I found it very difficult to snap out of it. It kind of gets to you after a while you're sucked in by the nameless miasma ik hora so I decided I needed to get out of it by writing a tweet story about pop See the pony in a butter cup splattered metal or somesuch. winsome talk. And and so I did and here is that story The Tale of poxy the pony Hello tinies are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin. Once upon a time there was a lovely little pony named Topsy popsy the pony lived in a meadow splattered with buttercups. It was a lovely meadow. The sun was always shining, the weather was always bow me and the other animals in the meadow, birds and insects and borrowing moles were happy and contented. Of course, it was a completely artificial and unnatural meadow. quite unlike real nature, which is bloody and gruesome and utterly horrifying, full of violence and pain and death. Just ask a sheep sheep. No. That's why they barely get a wink of sleep. They're so frightened and fretful. Anyway, tiny one day pop, see the pony was having a lovely time in the lovely metal, when all of a sudden this pastoral ideal was shattered by the intrusion of reality. No, let me rephrase that. This pastoral ideal was shattered by the intrusion of the hidden lovecraftian true reality beyond our puny human comprehension, and poxy the pony was slobbering Li devoured by an enormous squid from the black pit of hellish nothingness, slobber, slobber, slobber, eek. The end now tinies you may run away screaming and blabbing like farington Thomas

Frank Key  17:18
and after a while, that was at the suggestion, the slobbering Li being slobbering Li devoured by the giant squid, from the pit of hellish nothingness was suggested to me by Max desharnais. And then when I published that story on hunting yard, pansy cradle Jude commented in her comment, she berated me for failing to give the name of the squid. She thought it was a bit unfair that the squid should be the villain of the piece given that poxy the pony seem so dim witted and foolish. And I accept it was an unforgiving unforgiveable a mission to not name the squid and fatally undermined what might otherwise have been a classic text destined to be read and reread and reread throughout the ages. So I'm more than happy to inform this cradle Zoo and other listeners, if there are any, that the slobbering squid is named nevel mossop nevel is quite a common name in the squid population. mossop less so. Neville masa also happens to be the name of the young scamp Singh chasing a swan on a new piece of signage in St. James's Park. He was chosen from a pool of over 1000 applicants to appear on the sign. You can see this sign on the hooting yard website because a photograph of it shows a scamp called nevel masa chasing a swan with a big x or big line through it as if it's forbidden to do so. Anyway, Neville mustard was chosen from a pool of over 1000 applicants to appear on the side. And there is some evidence that the pool was the very same pool into which never Mater the squid slithered after devouring popsie the pony, but this has yet to be confirmed. Incidentally, never must have also turned up in a new collection by tweet poet Dennis beer pint. Here's the poem. There was a young fellow from glossip, whose name was nevel mossop. He frightened swans. This is one of the so called truncated limericks in the beer pint book, entitled truncated limericks by Dennis beer pint danio. Towards the end of the book, there are no Have what the Winston diversifier calls severely truncated limericks such as they're in the review of this slim volume critic stock odd owl head right? Dennis beer pod is an utter nitwit. Do you have any exciting nevel mossop information, do not on any account share it. Just keep it to yourself you pimpled popping dry

Frank Key  20:55
and after that appeared on hooting yard at hunting yard.org I received a letter from Neville mosop. It read as follows Dear Mr. Kay, my name is Neville masa. The licensed outpouring on your foolish website was brought to my attention by my dentist. I have to say that I do not take kindly to having my name bandied about by the likes of you purely for the purpose of amusing your readers and listeners. If there are any apart from my dentist. You did not even bother to seek my permission. If you knew anything about me, I doubt you would be so Cavalier. I have had a very difficult life. As a child. I was teased incessantly by my playmates, on account of my inability to punctuate sentences after my opening sallied, they treated me cruelly. Oh, so Crawley. In fact, one day when I went to have a go on the swings. A boy whose name coincidentally was also never muscle, took a bowl of milk slops, and attended it over my head, then poked at me with a twig while reciting and a singsong voice some deceit he had learned from a book of insulting ditties. I cannot recall the exact words, but they pissed me like spikes, and I began to blab like a ninny, which only made things worse, particularly when I arrived home and saw that my mom was cooking swordfish for supper again, even though she knew quite well, that swordfish played havoc with my innards. I will spay the details, because they're too monstrous to repeat. Suffice to say, I had to be carted off to a clinic and missed the whole term of school. I think the one where they talk punctuation of sentences after the first few, so you can appreciate that I've had a terrible time and have become a self pitying whiner. Rather than the international man of mystery with a Peter winguard style mustache. I always yearned to be and still do. But I fear it's too late, as I am now 92 years of age, and very few if any agencies employ international man of mystery of such advanced years, and I would say I live in hope, but I do not. I'm thoroughly pessimistic to the point where I wake up every morning groaning and cursing the memory of nevel muscle, my childhood acquaintance who caused me such grief. And now I have to put up with you, causing me grief to as well as my dentist, who told me not to waste his time making an appointment to see him when I haven't got any teeth left in mind, God being so old and women, unlike the young scamp with the same name as me, who chases swans in parks, I never chased a swan but you should know that the only reason I left the clinic after that bout of swordfish poisoning with because I was chased out of it by swans, a whole gaggle of them honking horribly, they chased me out of my bed, and out of the ward, and along the corridor, and down the stairs, and out of the door and into the ground and out of the gate, and I was still in my hospital gown. And still swans came after me, savage and relentless, and then I developed a massive nosebleed, which was the last thing I needed. Well, I suppose not the last thing because the last thing would be death, and it's rare to die from a nosebleed. But I expect you would die from one if the flow is not staunched. I stone mine that day with some rags I found in a bin. You can find all sorts of things in bins if you rummage, for example. Just the other day, I found some pages torn out of a book by Dennis Pierpont that someone had obviously found so stupid that they rip them out and threw them away while I kept them and took them home and read them very carefully again and again over the next few days, until I realized they were after twaddle, at which point I crumbled them up and Took them back to the same bin to throw them away, but the other person had done, but the beam was gone. It had been removed by municipal bin removers, one of whom I later learned was also called Neff or mossop, as were two of his colleague, which is quite a series of coincidences, or maybe not, perhaps it was a deliberate

Frank Key  25:21
recruitment policy pursued by a madcap Town Hall bureaucrat whose name might also have been Neville mustard for all I know, and I suppose I could find out by going to the town hall and banging my fist on the reception desk until someone gave me a list of all the bureaucrats in the town hall. But when you get to the age of 92, the prospect of making the bus journey to the town hall is a bit too much to cope with, and it seems far more enticing to say sprawl in your bed, cursing the young scamp. nevel mossop and swans and swordfish. And people like you, Mr. Key who think it's amusing to write poppycock about someone you've never met, and who might take umbrage at having his name besmirched. You're sincerely nevel mossop.

Frank Key  26:27
That's the end of this week's show. I could read you some more further science, but I can't find one short enough, brief enough to fit into our limited time. Although there is a double page spread in the middle of the booklet of cloud art, figuring out manga lizard, Crone, Abraham Hummingbird, Turkish beggar pondering inshore lifeboat, Swiss Lake, child, Bishop and wake color photocopies of cloud formations. I have to say the I'm not sure if any of them actually look like what Norland Davis says they look like but I just also realized that that's a rather foolish thing to read on the radio, which is not a museum, best designed for discussion of cloud formations. I think I better go. I'll be back next week. Bye. Bye.

Unknown Speaker  28:21
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers. They wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
