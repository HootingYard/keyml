Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. We've got a lot to get through this week. So let's get on with it. And life size marzipan wolf makes a splendid Tea Time treat at gatherings of the extended family. For smaller kinship group clips, it can be portioned up and served piecemeal after supper over several days, or even weeks, depending on the portion sizes. The first thing to do is to commandeer the kitchen together with any adjacent pantries, ladders and ice houses. If you employ skivvies drive them out with a broom if necessary. They can busy themselves or while in an outbuilding or annex or you can just dismiss them with or without character references. Bear in mind, however, that when you finished making your life size, marzipan Wolf, you will probably want the skivvies back in the kitchen, toiling through all the hours God sends. So whatever you decide to do, treat them with kindness, or at least what passes for kindness in your bleak, forbidding grim, authoritarian household. Next, acquire a large glob of marzipan, it should be at least the size if not the shape of an average adult wolf. If you're not sure what that is, make study of wolves. For example, by combing through reference books, preferably illustrated by watching informative documentary films at the local flea pit or by stalking the heats and malls that dead of night. Remember that in moonlight it can be difficult to judge distance, so get as close to any pack of Heath or more land wolves as you possibly can wear dark clothing and night vision goggles if they're available in your neck of the woods. Once you're alone in the kitchen with a wolf sized glob of marzipan on the countertop, you can proceed to mold it into the shape of a wolf. The basic idea is to go for absolute verisimilitude so that the members of your extended family or smaller kinship group blood do a double take. Mio my What on earth is a wolf doing sitting there without a care in the world on an enormous cake stand in the middle of the dining table? They will exclaim before blinking a couple of times and adding Oh, silly me. Look, it's all yellow and made out of marzipan. It can be a very tricky effect to pull off successfully, especially if you're cack handed. nor should you even begin the project if you're suffering from delirium tremens, or from any other condition which causes you to shake uncontrollably, such as having recently spent five hours or top of vibrating platform or watched a terrifying non documentary film about spooks and ghosties and monsters at the local flea pit. Steady handed then mould the marzipan accordingly and place it on the aforementioned enormous cake stand in the middle of your dining table. You're now ready to throw open the doors of the dining room and beckon your extended family or smaller kinship grouplet. Who will be lounging around in the parlor, glugging Sherry and exchanging anecdotes, or if puritanical, as they probably are, given the bleak, forbidding grim, authoritarian nature of your household, sipping from tumblers of tap water, and frowning in silence bonati

on a frosty winter's morning in the middle of the 20th century, legendary athletics coach, old halabi stood at the side of a running track stopwatch in hand, Homburg on head, racked with guitar and puffing a cigarette. He was much perturbed his protege, fictional athlete Bob net to vol was pounding round and round The track at ever higher speeds, but old how Rob's brain was a whirling chaos. He had not slept for weeks, and he was even more bad tempered than usual. The spindly fictional sprinter whizzing past him, was causing the one time secret policeman, much vexation. He was running faster than ever, and when pole vaulting he was pole vaulting higher than ever. He was winning medals and cups in all sorts of fictional athletics and meetings, not least the gloriously shining medallion of gak awarded to the champ of champs in the pointy town auxiliary substandard, jumping about league reserve heat, but for old hallowed all this was as ignored for what he most desired for Bob net tavole was fame and fame eluded him. In the narrow enclosed world of fictional athletics, Bob net to vol was, of course unnamed to be reckoned with. Yet in the wider world, he remained unknown. It had long been the dream of all halab that his protege be the sinoder of all eyes, a titan worshiped not just by fictional athletics fans, but by all and sundry the great and good and the hoi polloi. It may be as some cynics like to snigger that the wily old coach wished to exploit to the sprinter for financial gain. worldwide fame would bring the money pouring in, whether it be for hiring out his image to be emblazoned on cardboard breakfast cereal packets, or for personal appearances at the opening of fairgrounds. Nowadays were used to such commercial shenanigans, but half a century ago, they were almost unheard of. I will have remained an old fashioned figure in many ways, but he always saw himself as a man oh the future and in pursuit of that vision is strained every sinew slow rhotic though his sinews may have been if there is such a thing as a slow rhotic sinew. So on that frosty icy morning, old halabi took one last path on his accurate Serbian cigarette and barking a command to the fictional athlete to keep sprinting faster and faster around the running track until his return. He trudged away. He headed for an insalubrious part of town, where he might find solace in rotgut, hooch and squalor and it was as about and it was as he was about to turn down a particularly dismal alleyway that he was accosted by an Austrian Hawking grubby where's all he mister? I'm European if you need some spent matches or tattered boot laces or chewed up dog biscuits or leaking batteries or contaminated sausages or poisoned cans of squelch show, or regurgitated hairballs, or back copies of the Reader's Digest. Everything's a half crown. your wares are preposterously expensive, said old Halbe. But here is a half crown for a bad copy of the Reader's Digest. I shall want something to read while I've been numb my brain with rotgut hooch later, sitting in the dingy of an ill starred Tavern glugging from a bottle of 90% proof mon seniors spasm old hollub flick through the pages of the magazine hoping to find something that might take his mind off his woes. There was an article entitled, I am John's head, which diverted him briefly, as did a piece about a heroic anti communist housewife.

He made a stab at a quiz based on anagrams of Ayn Rand. Then he came upon a picture spread of artworks by Sir Frederick Leighton 1830 to 1896 and saw something that made fireworks go off in his brain. It was a photograph of a sculpture by Leighton from 1877 entitled, athlete wrestling with a Python. Old hollub was transfixed. He ordered another bottle of hooch and began to formulate a scheme. lightens sculpture had been a great popular success in its day. Why then, if old Hello were to create a modern adaptation, fictional athlete wrestling with a real Python, would that not equally astound the public? What could better propel fictional athletes Bob net to evolve to universal acclaim than the side of him doing battle with an all too real Python and winning. draining his second bottle and reeling out of the tavern into the ghastly streets. Old hollub decided to leave his spindly protege herring around the track for the time being. While he set off to find a Python. There was a zoo and a number of menageries in the town, but they were all shot it being a Thursday, tacked up on a lamp post. He saw a notice about a newly opened snake pit and boarded a tram to take him there. But the tram crashed into a parade of horses. And old Hello was among a number of tram passengers and equestrians who were ferried to a clinic on stretchers. It was nightfall before he was released, bloody and bandaged. And he made his way to the running track where in dusk and drizzle fictional athlete Bob Nick devall, as close to exhaustion as a fictional athlete can be, we're still zooming round and round and round. Old hollub popped his whistle, and young bob bennett collapsed in a fictional heap upon the cinders. Great news, shouted old hallowed tomorrow, you shall wrestle a real Python and the world will be a gogue gak panted Bob narrative all collapsing still further. The next day adorned with more frost and ice and drizzle. Old Halloween dragged his fictional protege to the pole vaulting practice pit and told him to practice pole vaulting until such time as he returned, bearing a Python. The Qatar wracked coach then trudged off to the zoo to find that it was shot being a Friday. He soon discovered the menageries were likewise shot, and that following the tram crash of the day before no trams were running, passing the lamppost where he had seen the sign announcing the opening of the snake pit. He saw that it had been altered the opening having been canceled by dint of civic pomposity. Were aware I might have find a Python wailed old hollub. at once, from the gloom of a gruesome nook, a thicker appeared like Harry lime in the third man, Carol read 1949 but he looked nothing like Orson Welles. His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness. But these luxury lenses only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost the same color as the Dan white socket in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and his straight black lips. His voice, when it last he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. You will find no pythons here, he boomed. But hi the to the bottomless Viper pit of Gar. There you will find Vipers. And with that, the gruesome knock was again engulfed in gloom, and the finger vanished

as he projects to the railway station to catch the stopping train to go old Hello, I wondered if perhaps from time to time, a Python might stray into the bottomless Viper pit. Failing that he supposed he could obtain a viper and disguise it as a Python or in Extremis rely upon the oath theological stupidity of the great unwashed, spitting into a Bramble Bush, old how old reflected that the masses presented with the fantastic spectacle of a fictional athlete wrestling with a real snake would be Likely to worry their pointy little heads about precisely what kind of snake it was. He would say it was a Python and lo, Python it would be. It happened that the stopping train to gas stopped not only at every single damn station along the branch line, but also repeatedly in sidings for hours and even days at a time. The delay that's caused was to prove fatal to old halabi otherwise flawless plan. And flawless indeed, did it seem when arriving eventually at the bottomless Vita paid, the man in the Homburg hat was greeted by the duty Viper wrist brandishing a net in which rived a living Python what Whoa, said this fellow who bore a striking resemblance to Orson Welles. I've just indebted a Python that had somehow strayed into the bottomless Viper pit. Luckily, I spotted it while it was still near the top of the bottomless pit. Otherwise, who knows what manner of slithery hissy funny business model transpired down towards the earth molten core. And ASP got down there once and cause quite a kerfuffle among the Vipers. But Tusk Tusk here's me carrying on like a guerriers bond with good and proper How may I help you on this frosty it drizzly day in Gar give the Python to me, wrapped old halb I really return it to the nesto rising pythons just down a ways past the viaduct said the Viper wrist, but I've just had my breakfast and I'm mad with cornflakes. So here the Python is yours. On the way back to pointy town, the stopping train stopped even more often than it had on the outward journey. But it last long overdue. It chugged into the railway station. Old halab retrieved the Python from where he had started in the goods carriage and trudged off in frost and Dyson drizzle to the pole vaulting practice pit. He was pleased to see that fictional athletes Bob Nick tavole was still relentlessly pole vaulting, ever higher and higher. he popped his whistle and the spindly youngster collapsed in a heap in the fictional sandpit. Later today, announced old hallowed Your name will ring out from sea to shining sea and beyond, possibly even to planets and world let's yet Uncharted in the immensity of the boundless universe. Yes, fictional athlete Bob negitive all you are to wrestle with Python I have here slung around my shoulders. At the moment, it is in an induced coma, but I shall awaken it as soon as I have rented a large Canvas tent and a wrestling ring and put up posters and sounded a klaxon to bring the greater good and the hoi polloi, in their teeming masses to witness a spectacle. unlike anything the world has seen since 1877 went to Frederick Leighton unveiled his sculpture athlete wrestling with a Python. Think of the fame that will accrue to your spindly frame as you overpower the vicious serpent and crush it beneath your fictional running spikes. I feel sure your image will appear on cardboard breakfast cereal packets, and you will be invited to open fairgrounds before this day is done. gak panted Bob needs to vole collapsing still further.

Half a century later, we might still be babbling excitedly about old halabi vision redo dar the 10th and ring were rented. The posters put up the klaxon sounded, the Python was woken from its coma and placed in a ringside Python holding unit of netting and bamboo. Fictional athletes Bob lit to volt was limbering up in his fictional ringside limber arium puffing on his high tax cigarette old hollub looked out from the 10th flap, expecting to see the teaming throngs come hurrying across the field and excited hubbub. Yet the fields were deserted, apart from a few dejected and immobile cows. Sad Could have been the delays occasioned by the stopping train to go on it. wheezing journeys there and back. That frosty icy January had turned to frosty icy February. And today, it was the sixth of February 1958. And the news had swept across town of the Munich air disaster, and the death of the Busby Babes. And all of pointy town was in mourning. On such a black day for sport. The last thing anybody wanted to see was a fictional athlete wrestling with a real Python.

Now, last week on the show, I announced the publication of the latest hooting yard paperback porpoises rescued Dick Van Dyke. Apparently, there are one or two listeners in some far flung corners of the world who haven't yet bought their copies. So may I suggest that while you're listening or as soon as you finish listening, you go to the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org and click on the picture of the cover of the book over to your right, and go and buy it. Now. Anyway, in my column in the dabbler last Friday, I wrote a very enlightening piece about the how the book came to be the gestation of the of the paperback. And I'll read that to you now. It was an order it burned the I'll cry and read it to you now if I can remain coherent. It was an ordinary day in November last year. by consulting my records, I can see that I made no attempt to log the rainfall, temperature or other weather phenomena. Nor did I list the birds seen swooping in the sky nor the ingredients of my breakfast. I didn't even make a note of the number of eggs counted by George Orwell on that day, 70 years before. One thing I did do, however, was to read bits and bobs in a Berliner format rag called The Guardian, and one particular bit or Bob caught my attention. It began as follows purposes rescue Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins star feared death after apparently falling asleep on his surfboard, but friendly sea creatures pushed him to shore. And the story told the tale with references to not only Mary Poppins, but Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Now like everyone throughout Western civilization, I was aware of the film roles alluded to in the story. I knew that Dick Van Dyke had amassed a massive fortune by registering his initials, so that he received 50 cents for every DVD bought or rented anywhere in the world. And I had read and reread his 1970 book, faith, hope and hilarity many times. In fact, I keep a copy on my bedside table in the event that I'm jolted awake in the middle of the night by a spiritual panic attack. What was new to me, however, was the revelation that the octogenarian actor was given to paddling on his surfboard out into the vast and merciless Pacific Ocean. Had no one ever told him that worse things happen at sea. The more I thought about the story, the more I felt it cried out for some kind of treatment, a novel a stage musical, a low budget arthouse film, a Wagnerian doesn't come back. Obviously, I could turn my hand to any of these with practice these, but I couldn't for the life of me work out the best way to approach it. The elements of the tail, elderly screen icon impairment on the high seas, porpoises made for a heady brew indeed, how could I do it justice? As ever, when faced with such a quandary, I sought the advice of a Jesuit but on this occasion my old father confessor, Ninian tongue lash SJ could not help me with typically jG rhetorical casuistry. He claimed not to know who Dick Van Dyke was, at the same time as condemning his performance as a sweeper of chimneys in Mary Poppins, Robert Stevenson 1964 as unholy and abominable, and very likely the work of Beelzebub. Winter closed in the nights were long, I wore buffalo wings to stave off the cold, and still the key to the tail eluded me. Eventually, I gave up the ghost gather together a ragbag of yarns from my radio show on resonance, FM and cobbled those into a paperback instead. Kim Kim Carew.

And that's the end of this week's heating yard on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to go and buy the book. And I'll be back next week with more stuff. Including hopefully the promised the promised recording of someone else reading the cruel See, not the famous adventure novel by can't remember who wrote it now. Neville shoots No, anyway, not that cruel See, but a cruel see that I wrote. And there'll be a recording of that next week, hopefully. Bye bye.
