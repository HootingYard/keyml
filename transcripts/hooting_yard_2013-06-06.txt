Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And I must admit I'm quite tempted to cast aside the material I had prepared for this show. And continue reading to you from the Gary Glitter annual for 1974 75 or 74. Marvelous stuff I've just read just before coming on air, I read a sentence in there, which I think we can all agree on. into each life a little rain must fall. Apparently. I didn't carry on reading so I don't know what relevance that has or had to dairy anyway, but I'm not gonna read that I think john will possibly devote his entire show next week to reading extracts from it. My Uncle Tom was a wine snob. He was also a swan knob, knob, of course, being shorthand for noble Uncle Tom's Cabin, where he spent the summer months as also those of autumn winter and spring was next to a pigsty. And he was just sort of Lord of the pigs, similar in some ways to the Lord of the Flies, but with pigs rather than flies, which is not to say there were no flies in his realm. For God knows they were Legion. But whereas the pigs were devoted to Uncle Tom, and considered him their Lord and Savior, the flies showed no such reasons. Why would they? underneath Uncle Tom's Cabin was his wine cellar. Bottle off the bottle after bottle after bottle after bottle in serried horizontal ranks on his subterranean shelving racks. He was particularly fond of Cabernet Sauvignon, which had a couple of shelves all to itself. None of the pigs ever got to go down the island's spiral staircase into the cellar. Uncle Tom did not want any of his bottles accidentally smashed by a clumsy, lumbering, and perhaps terrified pig. Uncle Tom was a great friend of the legendary Russian goalkeeper lev Yashin. They had formed a close bond one day in the 1950s. My uncle never betrayed any of leves confidences, no matter how much I badgered him, and boy did I badger him. Whenever he felt my badgering became too much. He pushed me into the pigsty and locked the gate so I could not get out. You would think I would have learned my lesson, and ceased being such a pest about liveaction. But that would be to impute a semblance of sense to me as a child, but I had none. And there are those who say I still don't

was one of those times when the pause in the Caucasian lullaby was longer than the music bit that I allowed to continue. I just wanted to carry on really, and then I thought, I'd probably come in before the music started again. But no. I should point out that that piece I just read was called Uncle Tom's Cabernet Sauvignon. See, there's a little little joke there. I'm not sure joke is the word anyway, I think I better get on. We now have picked the elder and Pitt the younger, but what have picked the middling history has neglected him, presumably because he did not exist. But what if he had, well then we might write a thumping fat biography of the middle inpit middling in stature, middling in importance, fair to middling in his accomplishments. This biography we could make up from whole cloth, or if we preferred, we could cobble it together from snatches from the true biographies of the other pit, the elder and the younger and casting further afield from the biographies of any number of not pit contemporaries, co evils and peers judiciously constructed such a book might tell us more much more about the world and the age of the pitch than any existing biography of either one of them, or of any of the many not Pitt, whose lives we would got to tell of the middling pit. Our pit would be a sort of invisible man, one whose presence however vivid is nowhere attested to in the in the available historical record, an invisible man, and also a Frankenstein's monster, into whom we breathe the spark of life. Vampire to for never having really lived, he can never really die. He stalks the earth and still pet the middling. If you glimpse a shadow, prancing down the street, tip your hat to him, toss him a coin he deserves.

Well, as you can tell from the last couple of pieces, I have continued with my habit of writing shorter pieces inspired by Lydia Davis. If you remember the last week's show, and it's a great idea this this short piece things. So here's another very short piece, but I'm going to follow it with a slightly longer one without a without a music break. So because it's very short, Allahu Akhbar. I shout as I did had the roses. I am and I bet it's very short, but I can't seem to read it properly. I'm going to start all over again. Allahu Akbar, I shout as I deadhead the roses. I am an Islamic gardener. The gardens I attend are based upon Islamic principles, and contained not a whiff of cafe filth. No woman shall ever besmirch the gravel path between the flower beds. And whenever a bloom sprouts atop a green stalk, I take my combination seminar and sequiturs and lopped off in praise of Allah. The only plants I allowed to flourish are varieties of old man's beard, including key and answers virginica, a tree both medicinal and ornamental, clematis aristata, an Australian climbing power plant called Martha's Alba, another climbing plant tillandsias whose Neo DS or Spanish moss a bromeliad and as Nia, a type of lichen. Because they is that lichen resident. I've never known lishan lichen because they vaguely resemble an old man's beard. All his plants are suitably Islamic. Occasionally, I'm mistaken for a hippie gardener, Steve hillage have gone with a spade in place of a guitar. I have been told we're like two peas in a pod. But there are no peas in my gardens because people do not have beards. So that was a short piece but this one now is a longer one. And it's a story in titled I can get to the beginning of it. Dim wit under the trellis. There's more gardens in this. That morning I strode out into the grounds of my country pile whacking my stick at lupins and at crocus's and in one instance at a swan passing between one pond and another followed The path towards the ha ha. I was startled to spot a dimwit standing under the trellis. He was a still grubby, plump dimwit. I asked him What in the name of all the angels in heaven he was doing and the grounds of my pile. His answer was incoherent, perhaps because he was a foreign dimwit whose language was not known to me. I took him by the hand and led him like a fat puppy away from the trellis, all along the path into the house. I was wearing a pair of goatskin gloves, so I did not fear picking up any germs from his grubby hands.

I Bade the den with sit at the banqueting table, and rang for snippet, my factotum to fetch him a beaker of water snippet took an unconscionably long time to respond to my call, which was unlike him, it was turning into a very odd day. First, the dim wit under the trellis, then a queerly delayed snippet. It was while I waited for him that I reflected on an additional oddity where I had that Swan popped up from I'd never seen a swan on my estate before. When snippets eventually arrived in the banqueting Hall, he was breathless and disheveled and wreaked of malt vinegar. I sent him off to get a beaker of water for the dimwit and then record that he slippage was a was a foreign parentage. Either his mother or his father, or both had come from a land so distant, and was not even on the same continent, but far, far away on the other side of one of the oceans, Indian Atlantic Pacific. I can't remember the names of the others offhand. It occurred to me that given his parental provenance, snip edge might be able to communicate with the dimwit better than I could. While we awaited his return, I removed my goat skin gloves, and thrummed my fingertips impatiently on the banqueting table. The den wet sat still and grubby and plump, staring vacantly ahead of him. an hour past and there was no sign of snippet. I was concerned that the dimwit would think me uncivil. Having brought him into my castle and promised him water and then left him to sit there, possibly dying of thirst. While i'd thrummed and thrummed words would be useless. I rang for my under factotum snippet, his nephew, and when he came clumping into the banqueting Hall, his usual lopsided self on account of his corrective boot, I sent him in search of his uncle. The nephew was something of a dimwit himself, but he was always eager to follow simple instructions. He returned, panting not 10 minutes later, slippage he explained in his curiously high pitched voice was standing under the trellis, clasping to his chest, the swan, which had been strangled, presumably by snippets himself. What a pallava I thought I asked the youngster if In addition, snippet was in possession of a beaker of water. No, was the response. I apologize to the dimwit at the table. In spite of the fact that he was taking no notice of me whatsoever. He was still gazing blankly at nothing. I began to wonder if he was a blind dimwit. But when I waved one of my goatskin gloves in front of his face, I saw his eyes flicker or bead briefly, I commanded young snippets to remain with our guests to guard him from my dogs and rats and the mad woman in the attic, who might choose this of all days to break loose and career about the castle causing havoc. And I strode out again, past the beds of lupins and crocus's towards the haha and found snip edge precisely as his nephew had described him under the trellis clutching a strangled swarm. I asked him in an exasperated voice, why he had not fetched a beaker of water for the dimwit he did not answer and when I looked closer, I saw that he had been turned into one pillar of salt, like Lot's wife are named in the Bible, but known as our do, or Edith in some Jewish traditions. What in Hell's name was going on under my trellis. When I went back to the banqueting Hall, I found the dim Witten young snippet deep in conversation. They were babbling and roaring and giggling together as if drunk in a language I did not understand. I cleared my throat in a melodramatic manner to announce my presence. They fell immediately silent, and turn their heads to look at me. And then they both burst into laughter. It was the most terrifying laughter I ever heard,

and I can still hear it ringing in my ears. I turned and fled. I hardly knew where I was going. I only knew that I must not go anywhere near the trellis. I ran and stumbled and ran and limped and ran for mile after mile until I dropped from exhaustion into a dick. When I came to the sky was darkling looming above me on one side of the deck was a swarm. And on the other side, the dimwit both were gazing at me with glares of unbridled savagery. I called out the young snipping edge, he came clumping into view. From further along the ditch, bearing a beaker of water. I glide down and asked him to hoist me on his shoulders and carry me home. by midnight, I was back in the banqueting Hall slumped in a chair, my head resting on the table. 17 years have passed since that awful day, 17 years in which I have not set foot outside the castle. And all that time, young snipping edge, now nearly as old as his salt uncle was then has been extending the trellis, bit by bit. Until now it covers almost all of the state. In a few days more, it will reach the castle wall, and there will be no escape. The dimwit will come for me, capturing a swan living or dead. And I will be I'm done.

Now, I think it's time for a hunting yard competition. And we're actually going to have a prize I've just decided this in the last few seconds. So this is the this is the competition. In that last piece. I read dim wit under the trellis. There was a quotation from a song by Robert wired and in order to win the prize, you have to be the first person to email me at hooting dot yard@gmail.com with the exact quotation, exact quotation, the name of the song from which it is taken and the name of the album that the SOT The LP in fact that the song originally appeared on So, Robert white quotation, exact wording name of the song name of the album, and the first email I receive will win a hooting yard lapel accoutrement, a little badge with the hooting yard emblem on it. So it's first first cup or maybe maybe the first two. The first two entries, I'm feeling generous. The first two entries will win a lapel accoutrement. So that's what you need to do to enter the competition, hooting dot yard@gmail.com. Excuse me. Right onwards. Our survey of artworks which we've been running now for several years continues with plenipotentiary with cornflakes carton and night jar. This is a large painting, though I have not measured it, showing as its title indicates a planet century with the traditional attributes of his office, a cornflakes carton, and a night jar. executed in scumbled dorbz of emotion on a sheet of corrugated cardboard the planet potentially is shown leaning insouciantly against the mantle piece holding in his right hand the cornflakes carton. While a night job purchase or top his head staples of what looks like grass has been stippled, his and scissor about the composition to add airline. There is an unseemly smudge at the bottom left above which the painters signature has been scribbled with a biros, seemingly so hurriedly that it's illegible. The overall style is a combination of primitivist classical Rococo expressionist work when some cack handed and gorgeous This is probably the most important painting in the collection of the toffee, Apple entrepreneur, archivist bone scrape, who refuses all permission to reproduce it in any form. That doesn't really matter on the radio when you wouldn't be able to see it anyway. But I've been unable to reproduce it on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org so don't bother going there to look. Up work she might also enjoy, borrow scribble without unseemly smudge, nice job with plenipotentiary and do ash staples and cornflakes carton number 17. The latter is a conceptual artwork and does not actually consist of a cornflakes carton in any form whatsoever, other than as an idea nestling in the artists brain. We have no current information regarding cornflakes, cartons, numbers one to 16 which may not even exist. If you would like further information on nightjars please consult an authoritative reference work on ornithology.

And following on from our series on important artworks. Here's the latest in our series on the origins of common phrases. And this week, the phrases to blindly go What do we what do we mean when we say to blindly go it is superficially similar to to boldly go, a phrase commonly used when describing the forward motion of the USS Enterprise, a spaceship on a five year mission to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations far in the future. And I have to tell you, wholly fictional in nature. By contrast, to blindly go is a way of describing the forward motion of one whose progress is accompanied by a soundtrack of Coons by the beat group Baldwin pig. Unlike boldly going, there are various circumstances in which one may be blogged legally. And these can be both fictional and non fictional. That is real. Dammit, as real as the large stone kicked by Dr. Johnson in order to refute Bishop Berkeley. But to consider fictional blog Li going first, we might imagine a cinema tech film or television program in which your character is seen in forward motion from point A to point B. While on the soundtrack we hear say the modern alchemists or backwash from blood when pigs debut album, a head rings out 1969 in terms of all too real blindly going, this would be seen when a person is Lola painting along the street with inserted into their lug holes. The pods attached to a digital musical reproduction device such as an mp3 player, unless they have the volume turned up to a barbarous pitch, we would not necessarily know they were listening to for example, the squirrelling master Go on from Baldwin pigs second album getting to this 1970 we may therefore not know blindly going when we see it. Similarly, a person might be driving a car or coach and be listening to a blonde wind pig recording on their onboard sound system. If the volume is not too loud, and they whizzed past us as we stand at a bus stop waiting hopelessly the sick, sick, sick, then we will be all unawares. That's such whizzing is bloodedly. But it is, it is. One of the main differences between boldly going and blindly going is of course, that in the former case, Captain Kirk and his crew zipping across galaxies with an attitude of boldness. These are people, these people are not shrinking violence, who would hardly dare say boo to a goose, or indeed a spice goose. wherever they go at whatever walk factor, they go there boldly. But with blindly going, the go has much more latitude. Going blindly, might mean creeping gabbing prancing, zooming, limping, skulking, zipping, careering, stalking, plotting, staggering or any number of other forms of locomotion. The blog leanness of the Act lies in the accompanying soundtrack. And we've had a competition rooting out competition. So we're also going to have a survey about that piece. Was this piece helpful? Choose the statement below which best describes your response? Yes, very helpful. No, not very helpful. I have no idea what you're talking about. I have always been a great fan of blood winged pig and think the best move Mick Abraham's ever made was to leave Jethro Tull. Or Finally, I am Ian Anderson, and I stand on one leg to play my flute. What can Mick Abrahams do to compare with that I

finally this weekend very quickly, here is the official hooting our bird forecast for southeast England. Today's guest forecaster is Dame Vera Lynn. There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover tomorrow. Please note that hooting God is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the bird forecasts provided by our guests. And quite frankly, Diane Veera has been trotting out precisely the same forecast at regular intervals for the past seven decades. As far as we're aware, nobody has ever thought to carry out a statistical analysis of the accuracy or otherwise of her claims. Nor is her methodology at all clear. Certainly, it's grotesque to think that she makes her pronouncements after reading these still throbbing hot end trails of freshly slaughtered bluebirds, a theory propounded by some irresponsible scallywags in the Dover based organization, Cliff watch. Those people wouldn't know a Harris Beck's if one came up and Biff them in the trot. Next week bird forecast will be presented by a special guest, Dame Vera Lynn. That's all we have time for this week. Don't forget to enter the exciting competition for your chance to win a hooting yard lapel a person or accoutrement. Can't remember which is which. And that's it. Bye bye.
