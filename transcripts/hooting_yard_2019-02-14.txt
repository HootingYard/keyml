Good evening This is resonance while Oh 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. Now in its nearing the end of its 14th year I've got a little note here saying, don't forget to mention ball. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I've read the note out so I've done my duty. Anyway, reports reached me of dismal doings at the pointy town Tourist Board. In an attempt to drum up visitor numbers, a faction on the board is engaged in not just the rewriting of history, but its wholesale invention. The latest brochure invites me and thousands like me to take part in the so called pointy town pilgrimage, trail, experience experiencing, quote, the sights and sounds and tastes and smells that greeted those ancient wayfarers who embarked upon the pilgrimage to pointy town in days of yore. Unquote. This is shameless twaddle. In the ancient days, to which the brochure refers pointed town itself did not exist. All a wayfarer of your would have found with an area of curiously pointy ground with a few pawns. On which ancient ducks and swans clamored. It's true that the pointedness of the land led later to the erection of a town. But in ancient days, there were not even any waterland daub dwellings there, and the area has no caves to speak of in which ancestral pointing towners could have sheltered from the filthy weather. The Tourist Board wants us to believe if I'm interpreting the illustrations correctly, that thousands of years ago saucy pilgrims' with terrific hairstyles, fetched up pointy town, from all over the land, and even from lands beyond and celebrated the General pointedness of things by holding strange ancient ceremonies, traces of which can be found today. For example, there is a gaping pit around the corner from the present day post office. And this is meant to be evidence not of botched contemporary roadworks but of a right involving herons and Vipers and bees and hairy men were always herons and Vipers and bees and hairy men are meant to have come from and how they gathered around the pit. And what they did once they're gathered, is all left a bit vague, as To be frank is the claim that the post office itself stands on the side of the pointy town thing, an ancient parliament on the Icelandic model and predating the Icelanders own thing by a good few centuries. I am assured that next time I make the reverse of a postage stamp at the post office counter. I'm doing so the very spot where an ancient point de Towner named an axe kratt Akdag. Let me read that again. I am assured that next time I will make the reverse of a postage stamp at the post office counter. I'm doing so at the very spot where an ancient pointy Towner named an axe a corrector graft proclaimed the brings whatever they are meant to be. They cite an accent correct agrax is supposedly related how we are not told to a tasa the imperious Mother of Xerxes, which gets the Tourist Board into all sorts of chronological and geographical knots. Indeed, there are so many knots vagaries and plain implausibilities in this invented history that Only a fool would be taken in that meeting. So, there has to be said that there are plenty of foolish people around for the pointy town pilgrimage tour is proving to be a thunderous success.

Frank Key  05:41
Last week, I decided to hide over there for the first time in years to see what was going on. I didn't bother taking the brochure with me, for I had dropped it into a puddle, and it was not yet dry. I will galoshes on the hat of a peasant for my trip, and rather overdid breakfast in the dining carriage of the pneumatic railway train, which we used with many splattering holes, through the horrible countryside towards pointy town, the pointy bits of which were visible long before we finally hissed into the station. Having memorized the tourist brochure, as best I could, I was aware that the station was part of the pilgrimage trail. It was there apparently, the counting of birds took place. The tally posted on a flag hoisted high. What numeric system was used, what material the flag was woven from and with what instrument the flag was marked. None of this was made clear. These ancient folk may have had a sort of hemp, but we know for a fact that they had no ink. And in any case, how did they get all the birds to stand still to be counted. I was already thoroughly exasperated as I made my way to the station canteen. For one last plate of sausages and treacle and a bowl of cornflakes and a beaker of tea. Imagine my disgust when I saw that the beaker was stamped with a pilgrimage emblem. And then the accompanying refill. It informed me that it was a reproduction of the beakers used by pointy town pilgrims celebrating the feast on the eve of the docking hack. my temper did not improve as I lumbered slowly into town. There seemed to be not a single street building a lamppost or duck pond that had not been hijacked by the Tourist Board for its counterfeit history. Even when I popped into a snack bar for elevenses, I could not escape. Sitting down to a hearty pan of pig haunches and Sue it. I was joined immediately by a local person sporting the hat of an indigent, who barely took time to introduce himself, before regaling me with his theory that the ancient pointy town pilgrims were not freeboard. Well, freeborn men and women, but abductees yoked together like farmyard creatures, driven to the town by brutish captors, for purposes we modern sophisticates could only get that he had drawings of course, which he took from an inner pocket of indescribable Grubbiness and spread out on the snack bar table, almost knocking over my tumbler of fermenting berry slops as he did so. He talked me through each drawing with some excitement, explaining that the sketches had come to him in fits of entranced lucidity. I was not surprised to see spaceships patrolling the sky in about half of these scribbles, but Curiously, he made no reference to them in his babble. He was insistent that I go along with him to see one of the most pointy bits of pointy town, where he promised he would show me incontrovertibly evidence of his abduction theory in the form of fragments of yoke, and train embedded in ancient shards of bitumen, but I was having none of it. When I'd finished my snack, I knocked his hat off his head and swept his drawings off the table, stamping them into the floor as I left. Back on the street, I checked my bearings by the eerie light morning light and headed towards the town center, where I wanted to visit the Tourist Board office. No one seemed who's willing to call into question before falsification of pointy town history. emboldened by my breakfasts and deliverances I determined to give them buyers a piece of my mind. It was unlikely that single handed I could dismantle the rash of a historical poop in golfing what had been my favorite town, but at least my spleen would be vented as spleens require venting, preferably after a good lunch.

Frank Key  10:29
As I promised alongside the graveyard wall, I reflected on the disservice these bumptious numbskulls were doing to the true heroes of pointy town past men like Fairbank push gas, the legendary Hungarian football Ace, who, though he had no connection with the place whatsoever, and indeed, had never even heard of pointy town, let alone ever visited in life was nonetheless a numinous presence in every Park and garden and patch of mud, at least as far as I was concerned. It mattered not to me that the pointy towers themselves were blind to his ethereal dash and Verve. Push gas for me, was as much a presiding spirit of pointy town, as was the medieval chieftain, Bruno lapu. Bell, who laid out the winding pathways of the old town, planted the grassy knoll, built the pergola on the school Book Depository, and made some of the pointy bits even point here than nature intended. But where was lapu bell to be found in this new dispensation? It looked to me as if the Tourist Board had erased him. And it was with a sick heart and a sick brain that I crashed into the cafe spigot next door to the Tourist Board office to have my lunch. Talking into a gigantic helping of drugged hair, lobster and bran flakes. I rehearsed the uninvited lecture, I plan to give to the rectory to the getters of the pilgrimage trail. I was assuming that they would all be there next door skulking about inventing fresh idiocies, counting the cash they'd fleeced from the ignorant. Only during the cheese, sponge and nuts course, didn't occur to me that today was a public holiday, and the office was likely to be shot. Yet by now I felt impelled to make the buying gifts feel the latter of my tongue. I would uphold the glory of the ghosts of push gas and lapu Bell and dash their pasteboard calf aside, or squash it under foot, on the foot, or crumple it in the palm of my hand, or whatever one does with Catherine pointy town. As I took dainty sips from my postprandial cup of soup, I remembered that pebble head had written a best selling paperback called a basic survey of methods of pasteboard chaff disposer in pointy town, and resolved to break and enter the library to consult a copy. Armed with pebble heads techniques, perhaps I could destroy the heritage, Horace, disfiguring the town, and unwrap it once again in the protective blankets of Bruno lapu Bell and fedlink push gas. The library was out beyond the seven tiny warehouses and the fairground, which meant that I had to negotiate my way past the dole hospital, the most frightening place in pointy town ever since I had first visited it decades ago, as an ambitious cub reporter sniffing out a story of gruesomeness treachery and dole related fruitfulness. It had been the focus of my nightmares. I never did write up the story and resigned from the pointy town Herald and thunderclap soon afterwards. Thus began my long exile from the town of my birth, my estrangement from all I held dear. The intervening decades have been hard on me. But as I swept along major your Boulevard, I realized that time had been harder on the town itself. All I had cherished seemed to be either vanished or in decay, and even the pointy bits of the approach to the warehouses seemed blunt, blunter and less pointy. Was the Tourist Board solely responsible for the ruin, or were there other wider, more sinister forces at work? I pulled my wind tree to tighten around my tooth. popped into a roadside Tea Room for a mug of tea and a jumbo packet of arrowroot biscuits. The tea room I burned was annexed to the pointy town badger sanctuary and impose a surcharge on each biscuit sold to fund it bad your work. admirable as this initiative was, it made for a tremendously expensive snack. And I began to worry that I would not have cash enough

Frank Key  15:36
in my puppy bag, to attend Sapa, to afford supper before catching the train home, I also needed to drop into an ironmongery to buy or rent the tools necessary to affect my breaking into the library. I was counting out my remaining coins on the tea room for mica table top when I mustachioed old timer sidled over to me. He wore the hat of an ingrate, and gave off a distinct aura of bit a goal. I was in no mood for another snack bar conversation with a conspiracy theorist. So without a word, I turned the oldsters hat from his head, scooped my coinage back into my Pipi bag, and made for the door. I was halfway towards the ironmongery. Merchant, when I realized that the elderly in great now hatless was following me, but making another attempt to catch up. I stopped and he stopped to. I took one pace forward, and he took two. This was because I have a long, moping stride, whereas my pursuer took more cautious, rickety steps. I was surprised he did not topple over. Using binoculars, I scanned his face, to which I had paid little attention in the tea room. So bushy and magnificent was his moustache, that it was difficult to see beyond it, but it struck me that there was something familiar about him. He tugged at a corner of my memory, but I could not yet place him talking the molecules back into their pouch. I walked on, occasionally checking to see if the if he still trailed me, and he did. The afternoon sun blazed high in the sky as I reached the spot near the municipal flowerbed where I expected to find the iron mangry many years have passed since last I was in pointy town, but I hardly expected to find this landmark Emporium gone. It was after all, the most inspiring ironmongery in the whole province, a magnet for bulk cutting enthusiasts near and far. Yet no trace of it survived. In its place, stood up plinth, a top which was a hideous cement statue of a saucy pilgrim with a terrific hairstyle, holding a cement placard announcing that this was the end of the pointy town pilgrim trail. It was ugly, it was spurious and a magnificent ironmongery shop had been bulldozed by the Philistines on the Tourist Board to make way for it. I was livid. I was also dashed in my plan to buy or rent tools with which to me the lock of the library door. What now? I leaned against the railings surrounding the plinth and took from my pocket a bag of brisket and toffee. munching on these would study my nerves and allow me time to think just as a bit of a mouthful of brisket. I was overcome by an aura of bit a goal. And the engrade, who had been trailing me suddenly materialized at my side in a manner I was unable to comprehend and cannot describe. He simply stood there, Magoo, breus and mournful with flies circling his hapless head. He was close enough that I had no need of binoculars to examine his face, and I forced my eyes to pay him behind the mustache, trying to recall where I where I had seen him before. I grew up in pointy town, and had an idyllic childhood. I remember tense and swans and dramatic hiking incidents. I remember flag days and sing songs and buying my first child size bolt cutters and other ironmongery items. I remember toads and pastries and gutta percha. I remember hearing the name first. Put gas on the radio, and the sound of thousands cheering. And I remember lolloping home from the library cluttering my favorite book, A lavishly Illustrated History of pointy town for pointy town tinies. And I remember the frontispiece of the book, a mezzotint by mezzotint is Rex tint of the medieval pointy town Clifton bruto lap belt, with his fantastically bushy mustache.

Frank Key  20:31
He it was or his race who stood beside me now. No wonder he was engulfed in an aura of bit a goal. witnessing the desecration of the town he raised from a patch of pointy ground. I gaped at him, Popeye died, nearly choking on my brisket. Then the sky so sunny a moment ago, with plunged into an uncanny blackness. And I felt Bruno lukou bells hands upon my shoulders, shriveled yet firm, and I felt the rustle of his mighty moustache upon my forehead. And then I too, was enveloped in his aura of bit a goal. But I felt most intensely and ennoblement of My Spirit, and the startled recognition that with the potency of my brain alone, I could smash to smithereens every vile Tourist Board pilgrimage trail Bubo, throbbing with venom in the pointy town I loved I could obliterate them. In an instant if I wished. The blackness evaporated. The sun blazed again, as it always did on this blessing town, and I dipped my hand into my bag of brisket and toffee, ready to offer a bite to Bruno lap boo Belle, but the apparition had vanished. I was alone by the railings, beneath the cement statue of the spurious saucy pilgrim, with the terrific hairstyle. I have the power to dash it to dust. How would I choose? I retrace my steps to the town center, beaming as I pass the ducks and swans clamoring on the pond, and tipping my peasants hat to the demonstrators from George Galloway's respect parties who were marking against something or other or in favor of something else. A Beatle brown university lecturer dodged out of the demo and pressed a shoddy newspaper upon me. So I tossed out my new pet tested out my new powers by swatting him aside merely by raising an eyebrow. I was pleased to note that as he hurtled over the horizon at Inhumans speed, his pile of newspapers burst into flames. I went back to the cafe spigot and ordered a dish of bloaters and spam and goose grease and fudge sundae. And as I sat waiting, I decided that I would let me evening train leave without me. I had come back to pointy town, and now I had work to do.

Frank Key  23:57
I didn't realize that that taken up nearly the whole show. But there you go. I hope you enjoyed it. It was all about pointy tan. This isn't there might not be time to read the whole thing. But it doesn't matter because it's one of those things that can end anywhere. If you know what I mean. Not well, we're coordinates of the rubbish dump. lantern handheld visibility hat. Sorry, say it's gonna I'm gonna be able to read the rest of it. Now. Note Well, the coordinates of the rubbish dump. Red Lantern handheld visibility, Stygian pebbles underfoot. Buck color snag up the neck. distant, incomprehensible keening? The Mighty pyramids of ancient Egypt. satirically cavorting the forest, a galumphing peasant with a pale. The rubbish dump would appear to be not far from the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. arrows fly there on the our timetable, clack, clack, clack, rapid clacks that kind of timetable rain on the pebbles and often choir singing a song. Bob crow Bob crow made out of dough, eat him up with salt and herring. A bit in the chops from an unknown assailant, fleeing in the gutter on All Hallows Eve, pictures of jack girls in synthesis, the seven wonders of another world. resurrection is scary in the night spades at the ready. Bob Crow, Bob crow. So bailius was a terrible drunkard, a dog sniffing a ditch, frisky carrier lumbering hound, two dogs then the Colossus of Rhodes, young marble giants wind in the rigging a front with a towel in a doorway like Harry lime in postwar Viana wheels within wheels, the windmills of someone else's mind. mind how you go, sir. There's room for one more inside. There's room for one more skip at the rubbish dump, Babylon or sharp, Sing sing in a cathedral choir nunc Dimittis and he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord Bob's Barrow Bob Lark Ryan in the gutters and filth on the stairs, I hear the sound of mandolins now the orphans sing Bob crow Bob Lark Bob bobolink call for another round of drinks. We are teetering on the brink, Let's fall into the abyss. Visibility nail in the abyss. Can I get a witness? Is there honey? Is there tea? No, you've drained your cup, you could not make it up. And that was that was called the rubbish dump. That's the end of this week's show. I haven't been much in it, but it's still half an hour. So apparently, the hooting yd website is now germ free, and can be visited without your computer being infected by Horace that said, I haven't actually updated it since December when all this stuff began. But I will be updating it soon. So keep an eye on it. And there's millions of words to read there. And lots of pictures and books to buy. That's always a good thing to do. Buy, you can buy hooting yard stories in paperback form, which I recommend and read them to yourself or read them to you all and if you have any little tinies you can read them as bedtime stories to your to your infants. That's the end of this week's show. And before I go, just a reminder that an anagram of Milton Keynes is silent monkey. Goodbye.

Life's like that, isn't it? me the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers who wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
