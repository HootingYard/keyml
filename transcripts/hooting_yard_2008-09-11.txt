Good evening, my name is Frank Keith is on the air. I'd like to pin a medal on the person who first realized that the blog format was a perfect way to republish notable diaries of the dead. Now we can read Samuel peeps, Gilbert white and George Orwell, among many others, day by day, often with annotations. I know it's entirely possible to do this with a paper edition but the experience isn't quite the same. Somehow reading a long ago diary as a contemporary blog, gives it a new life. Incidentally, in a related move, an admirable maniac is currently posting Moby Dick or the whale by Herman Melville line by line hour by hour on Twitter. One day to diary yet to appear online is the Journal of Dobson the out of print pamphleteer who bestrode the 20th century like a Colossus as one of the most indefatigable Dobson estates of the day, I've often been approached by people asking if I will undertake such a project. Sometimes these please come in the form of polite emails, sometimes as mad screeds scribbled in blood over dozens of tatty pages. And once I was set upon by men wielding candles, as I sat up on a picnic rug at a Mendips picnic spot, eating a picnic. No sooner had I popped a saucy jet into my mouth. Then a group of Dobson fixated fanatics Hove interview for my top men debt pill and bogged down upon me screaming their heads off and demanding that I transcribe the journals and post them on a dedicated website on a daily basis. In view of such continued increases, let me explain why I have neglected to do so. On the face of it, the pamphlet is mostly unpublished journal would be a magnificent addition to the interweb. When you consider the seething mass of clotted twaddle that does appear online, the absence of Dobson seemed somehow insane. And just How hard would it be for me, or for anybody to type up a few lines of dogs Sonia every day and to share them with the world. However, as I said to the casual wielding nutcases at my Mendips picnic spot as they rained blows upon my thankfully, well, cushioned balaclava. Things are not as simple as that. The great attraction of the dead diary as blog is what I could dub, calendrical integrity. So what x scribbled in his diary on September the 11th 1847, is posted online on September the 11th 2008. We're always aware that we're reading a snapshot of ex's life on precisely this day, many years ago. There's no Express requirement for it to be this way, but that's how it is and how we want it to be. Of course, few transcribers will take account of anomalies, such as the change in Britain from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1750 to when September the second was followed immediately by September the 14th. Unfortunately, the anomalies thrown up by Dobson's journal are far more complicated. Dobson you see us neither the Julian norther Gregorian calendar, but one of his own devising, This in itself will not be problematic for the calendar itself not ludicrous, absurd and senseless. Even the pointy heads at the pointy town School of Dobson studies Dobson calendar study group have thus far been defeated in their exhausting efforts to elucidate it. Indeed, the leader of the study group, a ferociously intelligent bluestocking with a brain the size of several planets, has been seen wandering the hills around pointy town, drooling and mumbling, glassy eyed and chewing on sticks, and will soon be carted off to a house of befuddlement far away. Those of her team who remained working at their benches, deploying their slide rules and Astro lathes and weird tungsten algebraic rolling pins of fast losing their width. It's worth looking at Dobson's calendar very briefly to see what has driven these poor souls to the brink of mental ruin. To begin with the Dobson year is divided either into 15 or 16 months and those months have a variable number of weeks. from three to 20

Frank Key  05:01
and the weeks themselves may be of 717 or 40 days. The names of the months and weeks and days follow no identifiable pattern. And one wag has even suggested that Dobson was making the whole thing up at whim. For example, in the year he insisted was 1967 in the month of topple, there were three weeks named barn owl biscuit, potting shed and Ray mill and the latter was a week of seven days. Lamont, pepinster, Hopton, Baxter, preen, flap, and tentacle. Quite one How is meant quite how one is meant to correlate this Farago of drivel to the standard calendar is a mystery, which I suppose was Dobson's point, it would appear that he did not want later readers to know on which particular day he clumped along the canal towpath in his ill fitting Ivory Coast Postal Service boots on his way to an ice cream kiosk stopping along the way to pluck a Petunia for his buttonhole. Nor did he wish history to know the exact date on which he inadvertently dropped a handful of pebbles onto the head of the infant Sarah Pailin. During that mysterious day trip to Alaska, he wrote about in his pamphlet, my mysterious day trip to Alaska, and what I did with a handful of pebbles while I was there, out of print. One looks in vain in the journals for mention of any newsworthy events, which may help us identify specific dates. In any case, such a fine would be of limited use, as the journals millions of words were scrolled by Dobson with a blunt pencil on the backs of cardboard sheets torn savagely from cartons of Kellogg's cornflakes. The sheets were stuffed Higgledy Piggledy into filthy greaseproof paper bags, and the bags themselves tossed into a series of sheds and outbuildings. The idea that it's possible ever to arrange the extant sheets into any kind of coherent order is preposterous. an intriguing addendum to the whole sorry business recently came to light in a tape recorded interview with a reporter from the bonkers spinny Peston bugle. Given shortly before her death, marigold Chu denied emphatically that Dobson had ever kept a journal. Every word he ever wrote, she insisted, was destined for his pamphlets. If that is indeed the case, who wrote the oodles and oodles of words on those torn cereal packets in those teeming thousands of bags that are stored now in a temperature controlled sanctum in the lead line seller of a monstrous building in the very heart of pointy town. Residents.

That was an exciting bit of different music there, just to keep you on your toes. This is called the nightingale board. For most of us, the world's Nightingale board call to mind that and paneled panel of eminent persons who devote valuable time to the counting and measuring and tallying and calculating of nightingales and Nightingale populations, their habitats, flight patterns, wingspans song variations, and much else that is Nightingale related sometimes tangente Lee, I've been meaning to write about the nightingale board for some time now. And I regret the distractions of Voodoo pig husbandry, ditch digging, aimless lower paying about and despair, which prevented me from doing so. what I had in mind was to do a comparative study of the nightingale board and the hummingbird board, the latter an equally tireless band of impaneled, persons who count and measure and tally and calculate all things Hummingbird related. I had in fact set aside this morning to attack the project with vim, and Verve. Having farmed out the Voodoo pig husbandry and ditch digging to a paid companion, made a promise to myself, not to lop aimlessly or otherwise, and countered despair by drinking an infusion of Baxter's perky up x spectrum fluid. After vomiting into an iron pail. I planned to sit down and bash out thousands of words on both the nightingale board The Hummingbird board. Last, as I wiped my chin with a rag the post he brought a letter from hooting yard listener Roland Claire, drawing my attention to a completely different Nightingale board. Mr. Clair has borrowed from his brother, a book entitled small homes, and how to furnish them by Mrs. valdemar Levitan published in London in 1903. By see Arthur Pearson limited. With great diligence, Mr. Clair has executed some photo realist pencil drawings of selected paragraphs from the book, the first of which tells us about this other Nightingale board. And I'd like to quote from that now, the nightingale board, should the architect of your house have failed to supply the Orthodox inlet tubes. The best substitute is the nightingale board, which any Carpenter can easily fix to the ordinary sash windows. The construction is of the simplest description merely a piece of wood about four or five inches wide and of the same length as the width of the lower sash. The thickness also being the same as the sash. It rests on the wooden sill and is held in position by fitting into the grooves in which the sash is held. By raising the sash and putting the board in the position described and shutting the sash down on the board. A space will be left at the meeting rails of the upper and lower sashes through which the external air can find its way in with an upward current in such a manner that the occupants of the room will feel no draft whatever, while they will be supplied with the necessary amount of oxygen. Elsewhere in the book, there's a splendid passage which I'd like to read to you now, which instructs the reader on the important matter of toy owl construction. A useful Ottoman place it so that the opening comes towards the room and there is a nice receptacle for music etc. Now make a cushion to fit the top, nail it on firmly and cover it with the material that drapes the piano allowing a valance of the same order around thus covering the music store place then you will have a very comfortable seat. A stand with a tool palm placed at one side will complete the arrangement as you will see by the sketch. And I do which will appeal to those who have a rooted aversion to superstition and a love for things uncanny is to have a center panel of velveteen red for preference and eight yards of silk either orange or a bright green. In and out among the folds of the drapery twist several Japanese snakes with a spider and beetle here and there to break the monotony. On the upper portion of the velvet panel. Arrange a guilt horseshoe with a cluster of Peacock Feathers twisted through it. Next, get a bear black bow as lightweight as possible and on one of the branches fix an owl. If you cannot obtain a Japanese feathered one, it's quite easy to make one out of crinkled paper stuffed with wadding and painted to taste the chief thing necessary being a pair of fine glittering eyes. It should be

about six or nine inches high. At the bottom of the velvet panel. Arrange a few lizards. In every case it's advisable to have a narrow strip of silk or velvet across the top. It prevents the piano being scratched by the photo frames etc which are placed upon it. According to Mr. Clair, who sent this to me, it's thought that Mrs. valdemar Levitan is a pseudonym, an anagram of the name of the true author of this excellent book, The Reverend lowland stammer, intriguingly, that godly man was a founding member of the very first Nightingale boards to be impaneled in his bailiwick. He may also have been involved in the hummingbird board, so my researches into that must sadly be postponed yet again, for I must Lola aimlessly now in this spare well my paid companion husband's Voodoo pigs and digs a ditch

I received a part from Roland Claire sending me the thing about the nightingale board I got another entertaining letter from the United States headed the hooting yard effect, and it sounds a cautionary note for listeners to the hooting of podcasts. The letter I'm going to read the letter as it as it turned up in my postbox. Dear Mr. Key. In late May of this year, I was pointed toward hooting yard, in the metaphorical sense of having the hooting yard podcast suggested to me as an enjoyable listening experience, as opposed to the more literal sense of being given directions to the physical location of hooting yard. After listening to a few shows and being introduced to the works of Dobson Blodgett and pebble head, learning about bonkers Maisie marigold, true fictional athletes Bob net to vault Mrs. gubbins and diminutive, adventurous tiny Enid and being exposed to some highly suspect or bit scrupulously alphabetical soup recipes, I felt a bit lost and resolved that perhaps if I listened to the complete archive of hooting yard shows I might gain a more thorough understanding of the world of hooting, yd and possibly even learn how to spell bibley bib dibbs. I have now completed my task and in the space of little more than two months, I've listened to all 140 shows that I was able to find on the internet. Whether or not this effort has noticeably improved my understanding of hooting yard, it's on Veterans and inhabitants is a matter open for debate. However, I have noticed an unusual side effect of absorbing so much hooting yard over so little time, I find that my internal voice when applied to odd bits of prose I come across in the course of the day. Now sounds exactly like Frank key. For example, I was recently in San Diego, California, in want of something to do wondering the old town section. I happened across an old restored cemetery. Most of the graves were marked by blank wooden crosses, with small interpretive signs made of deteriorating photocopied text sandwiched between glass plates. One of these signs read as best as I can recall, the unknown German. This grave marks the resting place of the unknown German. This man came to San Diego from Germany in 18. Terminal digits illegible. Very little is known about his life here, how and why he came to San Diego, as well as how he died is unknown. I read this silently to myself, but the voice I heard was plainly Frank keys. This doesn't happen with newspaper articles, magazine stories, street signs, short stories or novels. It occurs only when I read unusual bits of prose like that above. I would caution any other hooting out listener contemplating ingesting a large amount of your shows in a short period of time. The effect while not unpleasant, is unusual. Thank you for the hours of entertainment you've provided very respectfully, Dr. Jeffrey Chilton. And now of course, if he listens to this show, when it's podcast, Dr. Jeffrey Chilton is going to hear his own letter in my voice, so it may well become extremely befuddled.

I'm gonna read two short pieces now one after another. They're both very short or short ish. The first one is called off at a tangent. I had to go and see a man about it. But he was at a tangent. He suggested I take a wafer. I have written elsewhere at some length about wafers and I do not intend to repeat that pretty little escapade. Not when I'm standing at the bottom of the staircase down which I fully expect a Google to traipse upon the descent of the goon, or she'll climb the staircase myself and enter the chamber from which it has been expelled. my arrival may well cause consternation, a ghoul leaves and almost immediately afterwards, a chubby man wearing filthy gloves appears. When I use the word chubby, I'm referring to my inner chubby man you understand my shadow self, the man I would be in my dreams. I do not know who awaits me in the upper chamber. Although I now know that whoever it is will half expect me to be carrying a wafer. I can use the filthiness of my gloves as an excuse for not doing so. It's an excuse. I have flourished on many occasions, not always successfully, like the gong. I have been expelled from chambers and attics and parlors, and even from cow sheds. But I will not be expelled from the chamber at the top of the staircase. For it is written that I shall dwell there in unto the last trump. I am waiting for the ghoul to be thrust out all dignity rinsed out of it out, out out, and then I shall rise up a crabby man puffing up the staircase, and I shall take possession of my final chamber.

And the second piece is called simply called bonfire. When I spat I spat into the fire that fire over there, the bonfire the one with the effigy engulfed in it blazing the effigy of the plotter, who plotted the downfall of the regime. The dastardly plotter he whose plot collapse by dint of our highly efficient spying methods, for we had uncovered his plot and it's very birth, when the plotter and his plotting cronies were huddled in a tent out on the month flats, where they thought they would be safe from our spies. They pick so remote a spot out on the mud flats in so featureless and expansive, flat mud that they thought they would know if they were being spied upon. But Whoa, whoa, whoa, they didn't. They had no idea that our methods was so advanced, and that we had learned how to place a tiny camera and a tiny a tape recorder inside a robot styling and calibrated the tiny devices so that they worked in unison. Saw that later in the lab. We could match Sound and Vision, the plotters, hateful, guttural gambling, and the X ray film of them huddled in their tent wrapped up in their car ghouls. We had everything on record. So when we put them on trial, all they could do was to look sheepish and terrified. Good. So they should, because they had sin in their hearts, the sin of plotting to topple the regime for which they were burned on bonfires, bonfires, just like that one over there were an effigy burns, crackling and fizzing on the anniversary of the plot, collapse the bonfire on which I spit and spit and keep on spitting until my mouth is dry, and I returned to my balcony and raise my hand in a salute to the teeming crowds who cheer as the effigy is consumed in flames, while the robot styling flies above their heads, filming and taping unremarked, just as it was unremarked by the plotters, those see the fellows who were rightly burned on a bonfire just like this A year ago today.

And then to end this week's show, I'd like to say a few words about propulsion tables. Should I say anything unexpected in five minutes is because we have a month in the studio. You can tell this is an exciting live program because I'm telling you about the math and the fact that it may a light on my nose for example. Anyway, if it does, and you hear me go, Oh, no Why? So about propulsion tables, then, when consulting propulsion tables, it's extremely important that you know exactly what you're looking at. This is all the more so since there are two different sets of propulsion tables, inside collation, the popular botsman, propulsion tables, and the somewhat arcane, non blocky and propulsion tables. Both sets are widely available either as booklets or as loose leaf plastic sheets, which can be propped on our little hands free propulsion table holding tripod. Of course, both the blocky and non botsman tables give pretty much the same results, depending on the precise nature of your experiment. And even some of our most top drawer propulsion ists have gone on record to say that they do not give two pins, which set of propulsion tables they use. But there's slightly more to it than that. It's hardly surprising that blocky man himself executed the non botsman tables in rather fruity language. I would quote him directly. We're not there. My upbringing makes me prefer the thought of throwing myself into the path of a speeding train rather than uttering some of the fruity words in Boltzmann's lexicon. sheltered it may have been and riddled with priests, but I make no apologies for the way I was brought up. Yes, I my blush when I read language like that spat from the mouth of botsman. But that doesn't make me a bad person. Merely I would have one who does not wish to be solid and besmirched. The blocky bones of this world may scoff at one of my refined sensibilities, and God knows they do. But I shall not waver. That's why I will not repeat the verbal abuse botsman poured down upon the begetter of the non Boltzmann propulsion tables. You'll just have to take my word that he condemned them absolutely. Given the popularity and effectiveness of Boltzmann's own propulsion tables in calculating all kinds of propulsion matters, it's common to find people asking why the non botsman set was ever devised in the first place. Oh, I don't mean that you'll be asked such a question while waiting at a bus stop or trudging along the high street or when you pop into the newsagent to buy a packet of cheap Lithuanian cigarettes. But at any gathering of propulsion lists, for example, at a cocktail party held to celebrate the publication in an important academic journal of a new paper on a Nazi propulsion problem. Or in the queue for the toilets at an award ceremony for a propulsion is tues one ribbon or a metal, you can bet that someone present will pipe up with the old question of why on earth, the non botsman propulsion tables were not only created but published in great quantities in innumerable editions and formats, and often included a picture of botsman on the cover, which was deliberately scribbled upon or otherwise defaced. It's as if he's some kind of starlin figure wielding limitless power who must be deposed for the greater good. And perhaps there's an element of truth in that. After all, botsman was a commanding figure in the world of propulsion with deafeningly loud voice the Constitution of a bison and the tendency at conferences to wear dazzling suits dotted with batteries made from semi precious metals. He had a curious way of carrying himself such that even when sprawled half asleep in a chaise long, his belly full of cognac, he looked as he was standing upon a plinth gazing into a brighter future. And of course, since his death in that unfortunate picnicking accident, statues of him have sprung up wherever one looks, or at least wherever one looks in propulsion, earnest circles, and it cannot be denied as a sort of personality cult has arisen in his wake.

Frank Key  28:45
Is it also true that the person or persons who devised the non botsman propulsion tables remained to this day completely anonymous. I had hoped when I sat down to write this article to reveal to the world their identity, then we could at least refer along with the botsman propulsion tables to say the Huffington or Whittaker more blanket Blears propulsion tables, instead of having to use that frankly irritating, non botsman formulation. It saddens me in measurably so that I cannot make good on my intention. I have you see been got at by dark and sinister forces within the propulsion earnest community. Tomorrow morning at dawn, I begin work in the salt mines. It will, I suppose, be something of a novelty to give lectures on propulsion to salt miners as they hack away with their picks and shovels. Although I'm fearful that the language deployed by salt miners is a sight more fruity than the language used by botsman in his denunciation of the non botsman propulsion tables. Why is I think to pack a pair of earplugs in my puppy bag to protect my delicate sensibilities for which I repeat, I refuse To apologize.

That's all from hooting yard for this week for me and the moss. Bye bye back next week.
