So that was the annual hooting yard bird quiz. I'd be interested to know how listeners did. If you've kept a tally of your results, you may wish to send an honest summary of your score to me at hooting dot yard at Google mail.com. Be pleased to hear from you. What else? Oh yes, my quote of the week this week is actually bang up to date more like current affairs than an old an old quotation. But before I tell you that, of course I'm before I forget, I really need to acknowledge that most of the bird fact in the bird quiz I got from a great book called flights of fancy by Peter Tate, which I thoroughly recommend. Yes, so I needed to acknowledge that the quote of the week and why he's alley is on trial at the moment as one of the alleged alleged bomb plotters before the bombs in July 2005, and it was being questioned At his trial on his visit to London in December 2004. And a part of this he said that on one day, he and his friends visited the London Eye and the London aquarium and of the latter the lung on aquarium he said I'd give it one out of 10 it was just fish swimming around. That's a fantastic quotation really, because what did he expect to see in an aquarium? anyway? There are no fish swimming around here in the gleaming city skyscraper where resonance lives and breathes and has its being. But that's all for me for this week. I hope you enjoyed the annual bird quiz. We had a few engineering problems this week, which may be why I sound quite know what I'm doing and but it's all been all been live as ever. Yes, end of the show, then I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
