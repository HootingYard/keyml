It is something to shout about in these days of rising prices when a firm can offer a better product at a lower price. But how is this possible? The answer lies in the ever growing demand for the gadget annual bigger sales mean lower prices. When the 1951 gadget Daniel appeared, it was praised by press and radio, the length and breadth of the land, and we received shoals of letters from enthusiastic readers for Never before had such a unique book appeared. The 1952 edition followed and was eagerly awaited by those who had now become familiar with just what a gadget Daniel is really like. Well, the 1953 edition is here with a mammoth collection of over 400 fascinating gadgets, novelties, hobby, AIDS, toys, labor, saving devices, home improvement, and miscellaneous things to make and do. No matter what your interest may be. models, radio, motoring, gardening, woodwork, photography, drawing, collecting, home decorating and repairs. The 1953 gadget Daniel will give you stacks of novel notions that will make your hobbies more interesting than ever before. And if you have no special hobby, but just love to puffer about with tools, like gadgets, Daniel will give you hundreds of ideas on what to make from the odds and ends of scrap material that can be found about the house. That's the gadget keynote making something useful from discarded bits and pieces and doing so without special skill or elaborate tools. Many a crisp pound or to have been made by handymen who have put some of the gadget Daniel ideas to commercial use. And we will go so far as to say that a good regular income can be made from home produced gadgets, gifts and novelties. Yes, the 1953. gadget Daniel with its stacks of ideas and it hundreds of pictures and diagrams is our most worthy successor to the additions that have gone before.

I'm going to be reading you more bits from the homemade gadgets magazine later in the show or possibly next week as well. But of course there are other kind of amusements other than making things with discarding discarded bits and pieces. For example, in his wonderful curiosities of literature collection, Isaac Disraeli has one essay entitled amusements of the learned in which we are told that when Porteous was employed in his dogma theologiae, a work of the most profound and extensive erudition, the great recreation of the learned father was at the end of every second hour to twirl his chair for five minutes. twirling around in a seated position wasn't good enough for Cardinal reseller. He preferred violent exercises, and he was once discovered jumping with his servant to try who could reach the highest side of a wall. most amusing perhaps, is the manner in which the great philosopher Baruch Spinoza like to unwind from his philosophical labors. After protracted studies, Spinoza would unbend his mind by setting spiders to fight each other. He observed their combat with so much interest that he was often seized with a moderate fits of laughter.

If you're not interested in making, making things out of discarded bits and pieces, you could always jump about or set spiders to fight each other. whiter spend your time. I've been spending my time on the other hand, embarking on a massive new work which basically, it doesn't have a title yet, but the subtitle would be something like the origins of the great poems, or how some of the great classics of English poetry came to be written. And the first essay in my series is about the tiger by William Blake. Ah, Mr. Blake, so glad you could make it do come in. The man ushering William Blake and his opulent townhouse was a natural philosopher, an alchemist and the owner of a splendid private Menagerie. I better make sure you have a right to Mr. Blake he gambled as he steered Blake into the lobby. You are the poet and engraver and Angel spotter and occasional nudist William Blake nodded in affirmation. Good good, said his host. Let us go then you and I come into the garden mod Haha, to quote a pair of poems yet unwritten. Blake's eyes boggled as he entered the garden at the back of the townhouse, it was a teeming profusion of vegetation, wild and uncultivated. It is like a forest he said. It is not like a forest, Mr. Blake. It is a forest, said the other. And when he spoke from somewhere in the garden, came the howling of monkeys, and the coining of strange exotic birds. But this is what I have brought you to see Mr. Blake, and he pointed towards a great stone slabs surrounded by choking weeds, upon which was heaped a pile of kindling. If Mr. Blake you are thinking that it looks like a funeral pyre, you are correct, but we must wait for nightfall. Come, let us repair to the gazebo and drink lemonade. And as William Blake drank from a pewter tankard of lemonade in the gazebo, his companion told him a startling thing. In the course of my alchemical researches, Mr. Blake, I had occasion to discover an elec seer of possible gold and several other ingredients. The drinking of wick unlike this lemonade has conferred upon me eternal youth. I cannot die. I am immortal. William Blake could only go up. The sun sank below the horizon. At last it is nighttime said his host Come, let us return to The great stone slab, my assistant mango should be waiting for us there. As indeed he was a shriveled and hunchbacked monstrosity with one mad eye. William Blake noticed that he was holding a length of chain, the other end of which was concealed in the shrubbery. The time has come, cried the alchemist, Paul mango. within human strength, mango tugged at the train, and William Blake saw to his horror and amazement of Tiger dragged from it to there in the loop pins and hollyhocks and Petit spurge, the hunchback somehow managed to pull the tiger up onto the pyre, and once it was there, he shortened the crane and bolted it to the slab. Thanks excellent work mungo said the alchemist. Now go to the gazebo and have a refreshing drink of lemonade. Then come back with the swan investors. Mango lurched off and as he did so, the alchemists turned again to William Blake, who was still gulping. Do you notice something curious about that tiger, Mr. Blake, look carefully. Do you see it is entirely symmetrical. In one of my experiments, I set out to breed symmetrical cats big and small. I'm convinced that the sight of such creatures will strike fear into those who observe them. Well.

Frank Key  11:41
Are you fearful Mr. Blake? He was such was his terror that William Blake ran screaming from the garden back through the opulent townhouse. Wait, Mr. Blake, wait, cried the alchemist. You will miss the burning of the symmetrical tiger, the culmination of my mad cap schemes. But William Blake had fled wandering through each chartered Street near where the Chartered Thames does flow.

Another thing I've been doing recently, apart from revealing the origins of classics of English poetry is writing some memoirs. It was suggested to me that I have to write my autobiography. And although I haven't actually done that, I have began a series of memoirs. And here is here is a childhood memoir. There is a phrase I recall from my childhood, regularly used by my mother when I Dippy and dreamy, was getting ready for school in the mornings. One of these days, she would say in her Flemish accent, you would go out without your own head. pitch. I thought, that's alarmist talk. But then, one winter's morning, my mother's prediction came true. I set up for school in the wind and snow, having left my head snoozing on the pillow. I suspect the people I passed in the street must have been astonished at the sight of a boy without a head. But I cannot say for sure, because of course, I was completely unaware of them. My ears and eyes launched as they were in my head warm and snug and still a bed. Sound familiar? Was I with the route to school along the lane and pass the duck pond and the fireworks factory and through the tunnel under the motorway and then along the canal towpath and past the aerodrome and the vinegar works, that I had no need of my head to get me there. It was only when I sat down at my desk in the classroom, that things went awry. In those days, you see we were taught such piffle as reading and writing and arithmetic and Latin and history. So my not having a head sent the teachers into a kerfuffle. I'm told there was some kind of emergency meeting in the staffroom a fog of pipe smoke then of course, and I was put in isolation in the sick room while they worked out what to do. How much more enlightened would things be today? head or no head? I'm sure there would be no attempt to exclude me from the diversity and self esteem lessons. Indeed, my headless presence would be seen as a benefit both to myself and to my fellow pupils, and to the teachers themselves. In fact, I probably get a prize just for not having a head. On the rare occasions, prizes were dished out in those far off days. They were invariably book tokens. And I'd certainly not have gone out. Certainly not have got one for not having a head. Nowadays, I could expect something useful, like a new app for my iPad app, or a voucher for kebab cabin. But back then I was kept locked in the sick room excluded, and with my self esteem crushed all because I'd come to school without my head. I would like to say that I sat there, reflecting ruefully that my mother had been right all along, but any reflection rueful or otherwise wasn't possible without my head, resting happily on the pillow back home. What happened was that the school called in a local doctor who made a snap diagnosis. After looking at me for about three seconds. He didn't even use this stethoscope puffing on his pipe. He informed the headmaster in a grave Dr. Lee voice that I showed all the symptoms of not having a head and the best treatment was brisk exercise in the open air. So they sent me running round and round the athletics track all day until the bell rang at home time. I got a ticking off from the gym teacher, to which I was thankfully oblivious. And then I was pointed in the direction of the canal towpath and told not to forget my head again. or they'd be ramifications. Yes, they used to use long words like ramifications even with headless time ease. What a different world it was. I trudged home in the wind and snow, went up to my bedroom, plopped my head back onto my neck, and sat down to warm myself in front of the gas fire. How could it be I wondered that the school was even open in such inclement weather. Soon it was time for tea. We had sausages and mash. It was only as I sat down at the table and tucked my serviette under my chin that I realized I put my head on back to front

I may or may not have mentioned before on the show that I recently read a splendid biography of the artist, Austin Osman spare by Phil Baker, highly recommended. And one of the great things in this book is, it's full of anecdotes and asides and nuggets of information such as this. In the 1960s, Ted Hughes and Peter Brook attempted to develop a language called Auguste effect effectively a magical language where words would have, quote, a more inevitable relationship to reality. Unquote. For example, the AUG for darkness opens its womb, staple of any phrase book as a cynic. Right, is Borlaug on my lawn drawer. I'd like to learn and become fluent in August. Apparently, it has a vocabulary of some 2000 words. But of these only about 50 counters real or gassed, according to Ted Hughes, and he should know. I wonder what the August is for by x. Silvia, when you first guess me You drew blood. Anyway, I hope when I've mastered the 50 magic words, that I don't have to have the dismissive attitude of Reiner heppenstall towards another invented language heppenstall memorably wrote, I had never thought highly of Esperanto. My father had once tried to make me learn it. But when I found that the word for bird was burdo, I could no longer take it seriously.

Now we've had a sort of theme in some of the items this week with some homemade gadgets, as ways of indulging your hobbies and to make things out of discarded bits and pieces, and then we have the amusement of the learned, such as Cardinal Richelieu jumping about and Baruch Spinoza, setting spiders to fight each other. But of course, another way of amusing yourself is to exercise your cranial integuments and that's what we're going to do. Now. You may need pen and paper to note these questions down, you will exercise your brain if a thing is made of chocolate, comes from Switzerland, and is shaped like onto a roll, could it reasonably be anything other than a chocolate swiss roll? So asks, after a while Pat Tom kings in his runaway bestseller, mind bending brain teasers for the cranium integuments a collection of hundreds of equally diverting thought experiments. It's a fat book as fat as the Bible, but not black like the Bible. In fact, its cover comes in a variety of hues, shades of Tomkins, own devising, created from pigments on operable another of his food and drink based cuisines is if it looks like an egg, and has its own nog, why is it not an egg nog? Best way to read this book is one question at a time. I found in foolishly trying to read a whole page worth of queries at one sitting that my brain overheated and vapors history out of my ears and I had to go and lie flat on my back in a pitch black room. Pick black like the Bible for umpteen hours. And 13 Incidentally, is a number that crops up umpteen times in the book, for example, in this brain teaser if he man tosses I'm pretty medicine balls into our waiting bin. How big must have been be to gather unto itself all those empty medicine balls tossed into it by the he-man. You can see what I mean about the overheating and the vapors and they're lying flat on ones back in the pitch black and the Bible

I'm finally this week. news from pointy town in pointy town. When they bury a dead pointy Towner in the pointy town cemetery, they dig a pointy grave using a pointy shovel. The grave diggers have pointy spades too, but they're not as pointy as the shovels. The shovels could not be more pointy. There is a price to be paid for all this pointedness is a price paid sometimes in blood, sometimes in coinage and sometimes in toads. pointy towners will roam the marsh flats outside pointy town, collecting in baskets, the toads that live there. Most of the toads have pointy bits, though perhaps they are more knobby than pointy. pointy towns genetic engineers are working hard to breed a point here, toad. If and when they succeed, the knobby Toads will become worthless as currency and will be left to go about their toady business in the marsh flats undisturbed.
