Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting odd on the air. Those of you who've been listening carefully to previous shows and taking notes and approach I recommend, by the way, taking notes, because you'd be surprised how much you can learn from this program. Anyway, those of you who've been listening carefully will remember that the best place in which to store your collection of gold eggs is a fubu it tongue in Cuba tably useful to know that. But what if you have no girls eggs to store away? What then? Oh, well is me. For I have not two girls eggs to rub together. This is the plaintive cry of the otherwise happy fellow whose fuku lies empty. It's a cry that however often heard, never fails to tug at the heartstrings. For those of us whose hearts have toggleable strings, which is most of us, or so I like to think for I believe in the inherent goodness of humanity, despite all the evidence to the contrary. And goodness knows that it's contrary evidence of plenty. I think it was Molesworth to who observed reality is so unspeakably sorted. It makes me shudder. And even I can see the truth of that. So perhaps it's fair to say there is a measure of unreality about my belief in goodness, real or unreal, however, I know that when I hear a poor benighted soul bear wailing, his utter lack of goals eggs, I weep. I'd like to think that you would weep too. But what can we do about it? Now that I have copious and salty are tears, tears alone will not drum up a clock of goals eggs to give to the fellow bereft? Imagine if they did. If as each tear rolled down our Creek law, we could pluck from the air a fresh gold egg and hand it with great care so as not to crush it to the tenant of a gold eggless fuku. Perhaps that's not so improbable as you may think. Sophocles, for example, believes that the tears of the birds known as the Melih, Agra DS solidified into Amber. Yes, yes, I know it's something of a stretch to conclude from that that the tears of good hearted humans could solidify into goals eggs, but it's at least worth holding in our heads for a little while. For where it so we could solve the whole problem of the poor fellow and his fuku and his lack of goals eggs. You will say that there are more urgent matters to be addressed in this veil of tears, war, pestilence, famine, disease, rust, inclement weather. All these it's true may place a greater strain on our heartstrings than the man without goals eggs ever could. Are we then to cast him aside like so much chaff? I have heard it said by those who might suspect subscribe to Molesworth two's tragic vision that the man would be better off filling his fuku with chaff and have done with it. reluctant as I am to admit as much there's some merit in this few. chaff is easily gathered. One need not go clambering about on remote coastal promontory ease or at risk of toppling onto the sea smash rocks far below to ride the nest of a goal for its complement of eggs. that quite frankly, is going to be how you're going to get hold of some goals eggs, because never in a million years in Molesworth twos unspeakably sorted reality. Will your tears solidify in some implausible Sophocles and fashion into goals eggs, marches on might wish such a happenstance to occur. There will have to come a point where the man ceases his plaintive wailing and settles for a food group full of crap rather than have goals eggs. But the worst thing we can do is to slap him around the head and tell him to pull himself together and to go off track gathering. No, we must break it to him gently solicitously tenderly let him dabit his tears with a rag and lie on a law and perform breathing exercises recommended by the most wise gurus from the mystic orient. Then, when he's becalmed, we can begin slowly to turn his mind away from golden eggs and towards

chaff. One way to do this is to plant the idea in his brain, that there is no such thing as a golden egg. How might we accomplish this? Well, if I may be permitted to interject a personal anecdote here, I think I can point the way towards a successful outcome. A few years ago, I fell in with a wizard, a mind bender type of person who managed to convince me and I'm not making this up, that there was no such thing as an egg. Not just a golden egg, but an egg, plain and simple. He did this by cleverly planting in my path wherever I roamed wherever I looked at all times of day and night, cartons of the proprietary product known as no egg. Thus assailed by the words at every turn, no egg, no egg, no egg. Within a matter of hours, I could no longer even imagine such an object as an egg. Thus, we can obtain dozens or hundreds of cartons of no egg and modify them using a magic marker pen or a crayon to read no goals, egg, scatter them, wherever the fellow might roam, wherever he might look at all hours of day or night, and he will not long have dried his tears before he can no longer conceive of the existence of gulls eggs, and he will happily cram his fuku with chaff.

There's something terribly dispiriting about a clunk any clunk. Have you ever known a clunk to Harvey Jonathan majestic and life enhancing? I do realize by the way that Harbinger, as a verb derived from the noun, Harbinger is not in the dictionary, but it damn well ought to be. clunks spell disrepair, floors, ruination even doom. Imagine for example, that you are an avid bell ringer. It's Wednesday evening, the time of your weekly bell ringing practice and some biblique did. can't even get that word right. It is a Wednesday evening, the time of your weekly bell ringing practice at St. bibley. Babe Dibs church, that lovely old church with its magnificent Belfry. Excuse me. It's the kind of Belfry in which bats are said to hang upside down resting between their nocturnal sweepings in search of tiny scurrying things to eat. Or depending on the type of bat fruit, but you can also drop for the bat, you think only of the bells and they're peeling. Tonight, you will be rehearsing an Angeles with your fellow bell ringers, Matt and Nat and Trevor all and chlorine in your parlor, you look at the clock. It is time to get ready. You scamper up the stairs two at a time and throw open the bedroom wardrobe in which you keep your bell ringing gear. Heart already thumping with the sheer excitement of the practice session to come. You put on your bell ringers tunic and your bell ringers, gloves and your bell ringers pointy cap. you swallow a vitamin pill. You look at your reflection in your gleaming bell ringers boots. You head down the stairs and you leave a bowl of food for your pet cat David carpenter. David Carpenter is out and about chasing in vain squirrels or birds or otherwise making a fool of himself. But when the time comes for his return home, he will shimmy through the cat flap. You take one last Preen in the whole white mirror and then you leave the house locking the door behind you. There are several bells dangling at the top of the bell tower of St. Beverly babe Dibs. They are still and silent, awaiting you and your comms. It is a windy evening, you pull your pointy cap down snug against your cranium out through the gate and along the lane you prance buffeted yet Spry. ahead of you looms the light gate of the lovely old church. Sometimes the top of the roof of the gate. You have seen appropriately, I like child or screech owl perched. But there is no owl bear this evening. Perhaps it was chased away by David carpenter, who you see now sprawled out on the churchyard wall, taking a nap. I think the word I've pronounced light is pronounced to Mick. So, from here on in our final lecture instead of light. You click open the electric gate and enter the big burly big Dibs. churchyard, or we're familiar mossy, toppling gravestones are there and you glanced at the one that reads drawn una nuku who departed this life? Wondering if long last somebody might have scrubbed the filth of centuries from it to reveal john una new goos dates of birth and death. But no. The gravestone has not been touched since you were last here on the previous Wednesday evening for bell ringing practice. on a bench by the church Dorset's sec, Trevor all smoking his pipe. He too is wearing his bell ringers tunic and his bell ringers, gloves and his bell ringers pointy cap. He is wearing his bell ringers boots too, but they do not gleam as yours do. They are scuffed and grubby. For several as a stranger to boot polish. you greet each other. So Trevor all indicates that matter Nat and chlorine have already arrived and are inside St. bibbity big Deb's presumably undertaking various pre bell ringing activities.

He knocks out his pipe on the side of the bench, inadvertently killing an ant. Many more ants will die later tonight in the darkness swooped upon and gobbled up by bats. The pair of you enter the church there in the gloom, Matt and Nat and chlorine are faffing about. This is for you always a thrilling moment just before you go into the bell chamber and set the bells are appealing. You are not quite breathless with excitement. But there is a definite quaver in your voice as you say hello to your drums. And then you're ready to rehearse the Angeles. Each of you grasps there, Sally. NAT is the first to pull on his Bell rope, and he sets his jaw determinately as he does so. But instead of the clang you all expected there comes a clunk. At some point. During the past week, a crack has appeared in the bell by dint either of your bows or metal fatigue. There will be no Angeles this evening. That is an example of one particularly dispiriting clunk, I'm sure you can think of many more.

Skippy the bush kangaroo might so easily have been called googie. The eponymous marsupial hero of the Australian television series, which ran from 1966 to 1968, and is still shown regularly on Iranian state television was the brainchild of john McCallum. 1918 to 2010, the husband of the late lamented googie withers 1917 to 2011. I'm not for a moment suggesting that McCallum compared his wife to a kangaroo. But surely, when he was casting around in his mind for a name, phase bouncy out back hero, heroine, and he was thinking of something ending in an E sound. He must have considered goofy. I don't know this for sure, but it seems at least plausible, doesn't it? It may be that at breakfast one morning. The successful Theatre and Film actor and television producer who served in the Australian Imperial force in New Guinea during World War Two, looked over at his wife and said something along the lines of, you know, darling, this intelligent kangaroo that will be the heroine of my television series for children. How about calling it googie googie, whose birth name was Georgette may has been amused and chuckled, or alternately irritated and trapped the pale of her grapefruit across the breakfast table husband, we do not know. And Alas, they're both now cold in their graves, so we cannot ask them. But a scene like this may well have been played out in the breakfast room of their beautifully appointed Sydney home one morning in the 1960s. I'm assuming it was a beautifully appointed home. I'd like to think it was. If Gucci had been amused and chuckled, it might be that later, she had second thoughts and told her husband not to go ahead with googie, the bush kangaroo, but to choose a different name. If on the other hand, she had been irritated and track the peel of her grapefruit at him, he would probably have said something like I was only kidding darling, and reassured her whether you storyist kiss, depending on the size of the withers McCallum breakfast table, he may have been able to accomplish this by raising himself slightly from his chair and leaning forwards. It's more likely I think, for a successful couple living in a beautifully appointed home in Sydney, that their breakfast table would have been a tad too large for such a maneuver. And john McCallum would have had to stand up and walk a few paces towards where googie withers sad. But this is mere conjecture. As is I have to say the possibility that Skippy the bush kangaroo at the center of this domestic miles drum had already been named Skippy by her keepers at the KU ring guy chase National Park, where the series was mostly filmed, if that was indeed where she lived when not working. Having cast the kangaroo or wild female, East and gray for whatever qualities she had that made her suitable McCallum are more likely a member of the production team delegated to the task. One of us the keepers the name of the marsupial Skippy, they would have said, not of course googy that's the series title may have been a fait accompli I'm sure there's documentation in the archives of the Australia nine network television channel, or indeed among the paperwork of the widows McCallum, the state, which could shed some light on this. Skippy does seem to be a fortuitously telegenic name for a marsupial harrowing, and it's equally likely that the kangaroo was specially renamed for the series, hence the possibility of that breakfast table conversation. On a personal note, I should add that though I have no memory of ever watching an episode of Skippy the bush kangaroo, I'm certain that I must have done so at least once or twice when it was shown on British television Long, long ago.

The same goes for fleta about a dolphin and Dak Tari, which I recall feature the lion or lions. Clearly there was a 60s fad for children's television shows about wild animals of both land and sea. One wonders if anybody john McCallum googie withers ever had the idea of bringing Skippy and flipper and the factory line together in a special show, a crime vert of beasts, setting the world to write like a trio of superheroes.

day as I was wending my way along the city streets, I saw on the back of a passing bus, an advert for a product called Pharaoh globin I've since learned that this is an iron supplement for the formation of hemoglobin. But it seems to me that a moving vehicle is not an advisable place to advertise it. For one glances at the poster, and before one has a chance to read it properly, or why he growls, the bus out of the range of one's vision, or at least of my myopic vision, I would have liked more time to scrutinize the advertisement for on that first glance on this Reddit as Pharaoh Goblin. I then spent rather a lot of time wondering a What in the name of heaven a pharaoh Goblin might be and be why it was advertising itself on the back of a bus. My mind reeled. our listeners may recall that almost exactly a year ago, I did a piece about the official color coding system for goblins. To recap briefly, the agreed categories are as follows. Red hobgoblins orange, fat goblins yellow, pilfering goblins green. Teutonic forest goblins, blue goblins found under sinks, indigo, wet goblins, violet, all other goblins not classified above. According to that list, Ferro goblins, which I take to be a contraction of feral goblins must be included in the all other goblins not classified above subset. Unless of course there are goblins which are both feral and hub or feral and fat or feral and given to pilfering or feral and dwelling in cratonic forest, or feral and found under sinks, or feral and wet. I suppose such goblins might well exist. But for the sake of the argument, and because it's tied here, let us assume there is a discrete type of Goblin known as the feral or Pharaoh Goblin. Logically then it must fall within the all other goblins category, which would mean code violet. Yeah, surely intuition and indeed, common sense tells us that violence is not at all the most suitable color for a feral Goblin. In fact, it seems utterly inappropriate. The sort of color one might only apply to a feral Goblin in a world turned upside down a topsy turvy world of chaos and confusion. This insight leads us to the startling conclusion that feral goblins must therefore be somehow out with the known color spectrum. Imagine that I told you that my mind was already reeling, and now it really even more. It perhaps also accounts for their feral nature, that they may be untamed and prone to havoc on account of being set apart from the normal run of goblins. Such alienation can cause low self esteem, as we have learned from many adult brain social psychologists in recent decades. What could be more damaging to a sense of Goblin selfhood than to be forever banished by one's very nature from the visible color spectrum. It is a harsh fate indeed. So no wonder they turn feral. However, I was clearly thinking along the right tracks because so terrible a social stigma could well account for feral goblins advertising their existence on the backs of buses. It's one way to get yourself noticed, as the producers have several dire West End musicals have discovered but an advert on the back of a bus does not come cheap. And one wonders how the feral goblins raised unnecessary cash.

Frank Key  24:43
My guess is that they were in cahoots with the pilfering goblins. Code yellow who diverted a proportion of their ill gotten gains to the feral goblins in return for the Lord knows what magnificent fire beavers being feral. The feral goblins may have agreed to, for example, Knorr and slash atten. Scratch and screech at innocent passers by terrorizing them into a state of paralyzing fear so that the pilfering goblins could come leaping down from the rooftops and make away with their wallets and purses and cash boxes. No doubt the two groups would then meet in a secluded goblins nest to divvy up the proceeds. This does raise the question of the bus operators willingness to accept advertising on the backs of its buses from such nefarious clients. Or let us say it would raise that question. Were it not the case that I miss read the advertisement, which turned out to have not a job to do with goblins whatsoever. It was Pharaoh globin, not Pharaoh Goblin you live in learn.

So that's four pieces for this week four essays which have appeared on the website. And listeners may recall that I'm attempting this year to write a daily essay of around 1000 words, give or take 100 or so on either side on a daily basis, and I've been reading most of them to you on the show. And we've got a huge backlog. I mean, coming up on first encounters on tin foil on apps on control of the fiscal leavers on babinski idiot half brother on the Goliath bird eating spider on Dickensian characters on True Grit on barking up the wrong tree on government controlled origami on porridge Island, on the devil in the detail, and the latest essay which appeared earlier today on speed, speed referring to the 1994 film starring Keanu Reeves, and Sandra Bullock, and an amusing read it is to that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to go and visit the website where you can read all those essays including the the ones that have appeared previously, since the first of January. I shall be back next week. reading some more of those that I've just just recited the titles of and in the meantime, have a have a nice time and I will too, I hope Bye bye.
