That was Henry Cowen, slap happy for 1975 doing the Caucasian lullaby. This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. This is hooting yard on the air. And my name is Frank key.

I'll give you some straw. I'll lean on the fence. Like the peasant I am on my filthy farm where the pigs are all sick, and the horses all limp through the mud and the muck, as the rain pours in sheets, relentless on wet, like rain usually is when it falls from the clouds, like the clouds in my brain inside my glum head, the color of curd under my woolly hat that soaking and drenched like my waterlogged boots tied with frayed length of string, which are spattered with blood from the butcher shop where I stole them for you to wrap up your gift to high end the straw. But used instead to tie up my booth when you went away when you went away when you went away.

And that was as close as I get to singing on this show. You will be pleased to hear. Of course that was a variation on a theme by Jacques Brel. On Thursday morning, bam, bam, went haywire. That's all I'm prepared to say on the subject. You might have questions such as who or what is bam, bam. What is the etymology of the word haywire, and so on. But quite frankly, it's not up to me to spoon feed you. 1000 see why you should not do your own research into these matters, thus freeing me for more important tasks, such as taking a well earned nap, smoking a gasp or while gazing out of the window, or stuffing My God with a pile of smokers pop tarts. Any of those choices would be a better use of my time than telling you about bam bam, going haywire. Oh please, please miss the key. I hear you wild do tell us more. To which I reply? Certainly not. Most, I might give you some pointers to help you conduct your own research. For the etymology of the word haywire. I can think of no better reference source than the Oxford English Dictionary. I write. I can't think of a better source Dobson's pamphlet, everything you ought to know about hay and words beginning with hay out of print. In fact, I'm surprised not to have recommended this pamphlet to you before. It's the most highly centric of all Dobson's works, and its first edition of 10 getestet nerd copies actually had a cover to which strand of real hyper affixed with glue. This had the unfortunate effect of partly obscuring the title, with the result that the pamphlet sold even fewer copies than was usually the case. If you do your research thoroughly, you'll probably be exhausted by the time you're fully conversant with the word haywire. Your head will be so crammed with new and exciting information that there will be no room left to add anything at all. That being so it seems rather pointless for me to tell you where you could discover further information about bam bam. Nevertheless, they'll always be two or three steps Have a Wags who don't know when to stop, who will plow on regardless, such persons are very exasperating like hyperactive tots and should not be encouraged. By find the best way to deal with them is to administer a dose of ox Stan, a proprietary tranquilizer more commonly used to stun oxygen at such times as one needs oxygen, which depending on circumstances can be every Thursday morning, or once in a blue moon.

It's just occurred to me. As I read that I thought I've already read this on the show, haven't I? The the bam bam thing. And that doesn't get that sometimes repeats are intentional, sometimes unintentional, that was an unintentional repeat. But nevermind, it didn't take us only a few minutes of your life. And who knows, you know, part of my intonation and phrasing may have been slightly different. So you can think of it as a slightly different version. This I almost certainly haven't read on the show before. During my long life, one thing I've learned is that whenever one experiences a triumph, it's a capital idea to erect an arch in commemoration. That's to give but one example, when I had a playground spat with a roughing child, as a mere child, myself, and I came out on top by bashing the little get on the head with a shovel. I proceeded to build an arch out of cement and straw and pipe cleaners, which I put up in a corner of the playground. So but none would ever forget that on that spot on a hot may mourn. I triumphed over Perkins, or whatever his name was. Well, I'm being disingenuous Of course. Sorry, I'm being disingenuous. Of course, his name was Perkins. I remember it well, for I built the Arch of Triumph. specifically to commemorate my victory. It was to be the first of many archers of triumph in my life. As it happened, Perkins prompted a second art many years later, when the pair of us longest strange method by chance one winter's day. I had no idea who he was, but he recognized me, probably because I was wearing the insignia of goose haven. He began to berate me with words, and then with fists until I grabbed hold of a nearby shovel, and bashed him on the head with it again, and he crumbled. The second Perkins esque arch of krylov was constructed from concrete and brick and pebbles, and the saliva of otters. It stands next to a river a river, in the vicinity of goose haven itself. I'm often asked whether I like to pass underneath my arches of triumph, either on foot or born by a suitably resplendent carriage. My answer invariably, is long winded, and pompous, and orotund. And I leave my listeners in some doubt as to whether I was saying, in essence, yes or no. This is a quite deliberate ruse on my part. I do not wish to be tied down to certainties. They're such a bore. The one certainty I will allow is that I am a man of goose Haven, born and bred. a surprising number of people find this either exasperating or deplorable, or both, and do not stent in letting me know their feelings. My usual response is to bash such persons on the head with a shovel, and then to erect upon the spot, an Arch of Triumph. It keeps me busy, which is a boon for we all know, the devil finds work for idle hands to do, or at least so I was told my mother's knee when I was taught in the goose haven of your long ago, buried under car parks and supermarkets, and so called retail and leisure complexes. There are ghosts they're now parading in their thousands Born on resplendent Phantom care. Reggie's passing under my arches of crime.

There is a scene in the second series of the Game of Thrones TV series, where denarius Targaryen and her raggle taggle band of Dothraki followers, having struggled across the vast and desolate red waste, their food and water supplies exhausted, seek entrance to the walled city of Cath by a mat outside the gates by the 13. The ruling council, whose only address spokesman refuses to let them enter. As the Mother of Dragons points out, not unreasonably this dooms them to certain death. The spokesman is unmoved. How to resolve the impasse at this point, another member of the 13, who has been working the back of the group steps forward, when his own arguments in favor of allowing the travelers in fail, he announces, I invoke through my he then unsheathed his dagger and slices are nasty cat in his own hand. But now, the gates of cars are thrown open and denarius Targaryen and her band of Dothraki savages are ushered in, and saved from death. I was going to praise the writer George RR Martin for this touch of brilliant until I learned from one of the terrifyingly erudite websites devoted to the minutiae of the Game of Thrones universe, that the scene is absent from the original books, and was devised for the television series. No explanation is ever offered for su by, or what precisely it's in vocation might mean in any other circumstances. And nobody ever refers to it again. So I'm lost in admiration for as a narrative technique just to keep the story chugging along. I shall use it myself and commend it to any other writer who reaches a sticking point in their story. The bit with the dagger in the blood can be modified or left out entirely. But is there a single work of fiction that could not be improved by having a character at some point? declaiming portentously? I invoked through my I think not. So I've prepared a supply of slips of paper on which is typed, I invoke through my said, dot dot dot followed by a blank space. I intend shortly to work my way systematically through the volumes of fiction on my bookshelves. A fixing with glue, a slip at the point in a book, where the narrative threatens to get stuck in a cul de sac, and then writing in an app character name. The effect would be jarring if the phrase would be spoken invariably by rogue member of the 13 zaros ln doc sauce far better than it put into the mouth of a character with whom we've grown familiar in each particular novel. Say for example, Humbert Humbert, or Elizabeth Bennet, or Joseph K, or Bartleby the Scrivener invoking sumaya may also come in handy in real life. I'm sure there are times for example, when you're leaning insouciantly against a mantel piece at a sophisticated cocktail party, when the conversation polls and you're lost for words. Now, all you need to do to revert social discomfort is to announce I invoke through my the ice will be broken and stay broken. If I'm correct.

After I posted that piece on the hooting yard website, I was asked by a couple of readers to give some examples of the way in which invoking soumaya can liven up even the most tedious of evenings. So here is an example. Country Road, a tree. Evening. Astra gone. Sitting on a low mound is trying to take off his boat. He pulls at it with both hands, panting he gives up exhausted rest. tries again. As before, enter Vladimir. Estragon giving up again. Nothing to be done.

I recently wrote a book about a cold in fact the Was it the the founders of Yeah, the founders of Psychical Research, by Alan gold. And one of the great founders of Psychical Research, was Frederick Myers. And there was a little paragraph about him in the book, which I found very amusing, so I'll read it to you. This is by Alan gold, from founders of Psychical Research. To a man of Frederick Myers, eager temperament restrained indifference was not possible. His pent up enthusiasm was sooner or later shorter, find some line of discharge. And it so happened that already line of discharge was at that point presented to him. Hang on, I've lost my place. I'm very sorry. And, and it so happened that already, line of discharge was at that point presented to him by the crusading Christianity of Mrs. Josephine Butler, the still young and beautiful wife of George Butler, Vice Principal of Cheltenham College, and later principal of Liverpool college. Mrs. Butler later, of course, became famous for her work among prostitutes and her campaign against the contagious diseases act. This time, however, she was chiefly engaged in what might be described as the spiritual seduction of promising young men. Her religion was emotional rather than dogmatic, and her methods of conversion was simple. Having aroused her query by her exciting concerned for his welfare, she would flatter him with an earnest account of her own inner trials and victories, and account delivered perhaps at twilight, while she lay with her slim form stretched out upon a sofa and at large capture him by a well staged denouement. She might, for instance, call him into her room to find her kneeling in pale beauty before her mirror devoutly praying for his salvation. Only men with the coolest heads could resist such an appeal, and Myers was not one of them. During the next few years, he met or visited Mrs. Butler repeatedly, and his way of life changed so much that his friends hardly knew him. One of them Richard Jeb, noted in his journal for the 26th of February 1866. miles devotes himself to self discipline, he never goes anywhere.

how like the home life of our own Dear Mr. Key you know, apart from the spiritual seduction, that's pretty, pretty accurate about my life anyway. Last night, I dreamed I went to dripping trellis again, dripping trellis where fresh raindrops dripped from the trellises in its many gardens, dripping trellis, where we were where we woke each dawn to the clink of the milkman bottles, and his morning song that odd strangulated cleaning the words never quite decipherable dripping trellis, through which in the afternoons the mobile library would putter before parking by a dripping trellis. And we would return our books. overdue, overdue and damp from lying on read on lawns in summer rainfall. It was a big colic hamlet of my infancy, where I lived until the age of six. It's a diluted memory. There's not a grain of truth in it. In my dream, I was skipping and gambling across a lawn, a huge lawn, in a garden rife with pee whips and starlings and lupins and hollyhocks, and the Vietcong. The milkman was there with much milk, but the milk was pink and gold, like the sky at sunset. He was singing, and the mobile librarian was accompanying him on a sack, but there may have been elves I pronounced towards the Grodd and peered within and saw lanterns and caged birds and my PA, then, Tish Tosh Tish Tosh Blunkett of j goes peek. raindrops dripped off the thousands of trellises in dripping trellis. A man with a klaxon made an announcement about a wolf and waved a flag. And I knew that we did not see that the flag had been dammed by a convict in a distant pompous land. I had toast and marmalade. There was a Nissen hut, on its roof, perched an owl and the owl hooted. And I woke. Outside, the rain was pouring down, and a bitter wind was howling across the desert with expansive cement and concrete and tar, where I was born, where I have always lived, where there's not a single trellis, from which the rain drops my drip.

I apologized. I apologize in advance for returning to the topic of Game of Thrones. But, I mean, you know, everyone's seen it by now, haven't they? And if you're one of those people who think oh, that's not my kind of thing. It is. I didn't think it would be my kind of thing, but it is so get with the program and watch Game of Thrones anyway. You probably don't even need to have seen it to appreciate this next little piece. Sometimes I find myself fretting about things, which common sense tells me absolutely not worth fretting about. Yet still, I Fred, think of it as idiotic fretting. The latest matter to consume my stupid attention is as follows. I was struck when watching Danish television dramas such as borgen and the killing by the immense politeness of the Danes. In both shows, the characters are forever saying, tack, thank you, certainly more so than the average British or American person would do. I'm not familiar with real life in Denmark, but I assume that the writers of the series are making every effort to reproduce the actual speak of contemporary Danes, tak tak tak girl saying thank you all the time. In Game of Thrones by contrast, we are told by Sir Jorah Mormont, that there is no word for thank you and Dothraki given that the Dothraki are a savage and barbaric, right whose idea of a square meal is to consume a whole horse heart raw, the absence of an expression of gratitude is not surprising. But what's bothering me is this when Danish dramas showed on Dothraki television, how in heaven's name was subtitled writers cope with a low tax. He needs to be sure a proper quandary, if an idiotic one.

And I don't think there's time to begin reading anything else, because there's nearly the nearly time for the end of the show on the beginning of the next. So that's the end of this week's shooting out on the air. do go to the hurting yard website at hooting yard.org where you can read, you can probably read for the next.

But over the years, everyone has realized was a masterpiece. Anyway, Peter has compiled a book of stuff about Q. Roan, including the including contributions from a number of writers and artists in response to it. And I'm very proud to say that I'm one of the writers in there.
