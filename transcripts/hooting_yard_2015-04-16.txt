And this is hooting yard on the air, which I'm not going to bother spelling because it would take too long. But it wouldn't take that long. But anyway, Yes, hello, resonance 104 point four FM Frankie hooting out on the air with you live from London and the end of last week show I promised you that this week I would read you some further directions from further science book 20 by Norman Davis published in 2001.

So did he mean knob or did he mean not? If Norman Davis is listening, which I sincerely hope he is, although somehow I doubt it. I'd like him to get in touch immediately.

It strikes me that if you study that list, you could look at any picture depiction of a person or person in closed from any time in English history and be able to pin it down to exactly when it was how you know, in other words, if you say a picture of someone with a big head, it must be from 1716 1719 because that's the era of big heads. Although with an old person, it could be 1603 to 1625. Or it could be 1880 to 1900. So, you know, it's not all not all simple. Anyway, I think we'll probably have some more from Norman Davis, later in the show. I mean, I'm tempted just to read his book entire to you think what an education that would be, but we'll have something else briefly. According to Hargrave Jennings, in curious things of the visible world. Sorry, curious things of the outside world. Last fire, written and published in 1861. He wrote, there are moments in the history of the busiest man when his life seems a masquerade. There are a period in the story of the most engrossed and most worldly minded man. When this strong fear will come like a cloud over him,

Frank Key  10:25
when this conviction will start athwart his horizon, like a flash from outer cloud, he will look up to the sunshine someday, and in the midst of the business clutter by which he may be surrounded, a man will, in a moment's glance, seem to see the whole jostle of human interests and city bustle or any stir as so much empty show. Like the sick person, he will sometimes raise his head and out of the midst of his distractions, and out of the grasp, which that thing business always has of him, he will ask himself the question, what does all this mean? Is the whole world awake? And am I asleep and dreaming a dream? Or is it that the whole world is the dream and that I, in this single moment, have alone awakened? That great 20th century pamphleteer. Dobson woke up in this state of mind every single morning of his adult life. And that was not the end of his confusion for Dobson was a great one for naps. He took a nap daily, very often more than one chloral naps as it were, and each time he woke from his naps, he likewise asked himself the questions posed by Hargrave Jennings, as he had already done on the morning of the day when first hear woke. Do you have the slightest idea? asked marigold to one blustery Blizzard Monday in the late 1950s. Have TAs in today's to have you lumbering about the place like a Dippy person, asking the kinds of questions most sensible people stop posing. When they outgrow their years of teenage Dum. Dobbs Dobson's reply to this perfectly reasonable query was most annoying. Are you really speaking marigold? Or am I just imagining this conversation within the wispy mysterious mist of wisps of mystery? marigold true was holding a handful of pebbles and proceeded to throw one at the pamphleteer. No, that's not right. marigold true was holding a pebble head paperback, and it was this that she threw across the room. The book was pebble heads latest best selling pop Borla the interpretation of DRI of Breen's a guide to foretelling the future using a combination of fish and recordings of lute music. Luckily, the book Mr. Dobson's head by an inch. I am going to go about my business in the real palpable world. Dobson announced marigold ku. If you choose to walk about the place in Moonstruck days, that is up to you, but it won't get any pamphlets written. And she's swept out of the house into the blizzard bent upon her real and palpable business. Whatever it might have been that day. Dobson picked up the pebble head paper back from the floor and leafed through it distractedly. He read a few lines here in there, and decided to go out to the fishmongers and the record shop. But he got no further than the chair on which he sat to Don and to lace up his Canadian snowplow mechanic boots, for yet admired in his dreamy days. He wondered if the chair the laces, the boots, were but figments figments made him think of figs and then of Fig Newtons, a type of biscuit of which this period he was inordinately fond, and with his right foot encased in a boot, the laces of which were not yet tied on his left foot merely and socked. He rose from the chair and made for the cupboard where in the biscuits and similar snack items were stored. When he stood he was in boot and sock necessarily lopsided. And this being so Dobson must what balance he had and toppled, bashing his bonds on the wind Scott. He was unconscious for some minutes in which he really did dream of the glove of aid and of his weak bomba, whatever that might mean. And of course, when he awoke sprawled on the floor, the pamphlet his swimming brain was yet again prompted to ask the Hargrave Jennings questions. Round and round we go in an endless cycle akin to the orbit of the planets around the sun.

marigold crew was still out and about so Dobson was alone in his days. Now wide awake, but still unable to gain a foothold in the real palpable world. He moved about the house as a person might blunder about in a thick fog, what they used to call p super. Because of the suppose similarity of the cloudy density of the air to the consistency of soup made from peas. Not to be confused with peas pudding, which is, as its name suggests, a pudding, not a soup. Dobson was thinking neither of soup, nor of Fig Newtons, which he had actually forgotten. He was doing things such as tapping the walls with his fingertips, peering carefully at the curtains, opening and then closing doors, or in some cases, leaving them ajar. As he tried to grasp what was real and what was not. stumbling past an a, an airing cupboard into the bathroom. It was astonished in a blurry way to come face to face with a monster of the deep wallowing in the tub. It was bloated, lascivious, coarse and repulsive. rather like Gertrude advertence virsh vision of Oscar Wilde accept that it had fins and hideous trailing tendrils like those of a jellyfish. One such tendril now lashed out and struck Dobson across the face, leaving not just a vivid Crimson stripe, but droplets of unbelievably aggressive toxin, which seeped in second through his pores and began ravaging his innards. The pamphleteer toppled once again to the floor, this time of his of his bathroom rather than a kitchen, still wearing one boot. But now he was convulsed by fit, as if he were Voltaire's officer with pinks in his chamber, alluded to, in another passage from Hargrave Jennings is very sensible book, and, like the officer Dobson lost his senses. In the tub, the sea monster now began to gurgle and splash about suddenly through the bathroom window crashed father Ninian tongue lash, the Jesuit priest and self styled soutine attire, nemesis of sea monsters, crackling in one gloved hand a harpoon and in the other a crucifix, then,

Unknown Speaker  18:12
then,

Frank Key  18:16
then I awoke. And I realized that all I have just written was a dream. Of course it was. Dobson did not become the Titanic pamphleteer he was by faffing about the place or muddle headed. When he woke up every day of his adult life. He knew exactly where he was. And if perchance, there was a smidgen of doubt in the matter, he would, in any case, plunge his head into a bucket of ice water, just to be on the safe side. How foolish of me to confuse the hallucinations of my sleeping pea sized brain with the iron truth.

Frank Key  19:23
Father Ninian tongue lash, the Jesuit priest and self styled soutine, a tired nemesis of sea monsters who appeared in that dream was I would have, you know, a real historical figure. He's often thought to be fictional, probably because the only reliable biography we have of him. By pebble head pair, was published in the form of a series of short episodes between the covers of pulp magazines, such as mildly alarming stories. yawns that might raise your blood pressure just a tad and vaguely disquieting tales, that the various scattered pieces were never brought together as a proper book is one of literature's indeed, life's great tragedies. And the blame must be lie squarely with pebble head pair himself. For all his learning and wisdom and panache as a biographer, he was a very bewildering person. Even just walking down the street, he left a swathe of goggle eyed bewilderment in his wake, and the captains of ships, whatever reluctant to have him aboard their pleasure steamers, but will bring to his his treatment of the life of father and tongue lash, quite apart from it being broken up into bit, and published in magazines, designed for a readership of the semi literate, and the timid and the nerve be jangled. Although what research has been done seems to confirm that pebble head pairs accounts are historically accurate, indeed, devastatingly so. Each episode is written as written is almost identical. The general schema is as follows. One, Father Ninian tongue rash has just finished saying mass when an earthquake in sprint panting into the vestry to announce that a sea monster has been cited. Either a ship or a boat, or a coastal Hamlet is imperiled. To without stopping to ask any questions, even something as basic as in which direction he should speed. Father tongue rash grabs the harpoon on a crucifix and charges out into the wild and windy shore land. It is invariably wild and windy. Three. After a little while of hair and the scarin scampering, the priest stops as Christ stopped at eberly. And all windswept and resolute takes from his pocket a volume of poems by his friend and colleague father, Gerard Manley Hopkins. He opens the book at random and declines a poem shouting into the wind. declaiming done, he returned the book to his pocket makes the sign of the cross and scampers onward. The panting Ergin who brought the message of sea monster peril, has now have time to catch up with the priest and stick close to his heels. For father Ninian arrives at the scene of impairment and confronts the sea monster. He is absolutely fearless. I am a tired in the suit tale of a Jesuit and I am your nemesis, he cries. At this point, the sea monster usually makes a gurgling sound, we are led to interpret as a plea for God's ineffable mercy. But father Ninian shows none. He hands the crucifix to the panting urging, telling the man to brandish it at the sea monster. Then he launches the harpoon with honoring accurately accuracy, felling the sea monster instantly. Five. It is an interesting point that all of the sea monsters harpooned by the Jesuit well over the kind of that, when struck, shrivel up and vanish in a puff of cloudy gaseous green vapor. Six father tongue rash reels in his harpoon, Pat's the panting Ergin on the head, retrieves his crucifix and acknowledges the groveling gratitude of those whose impairment he has quashed, be they the crew of a ship or a boat, or the peasant inhabitants of a coastal Hamlet.

Seven. As the priest went his way back to his vestry pebble head pear does three things. He makes note based upon what sources he never revealed, of all the types of birds in the sky and perched upon branches, which the Jesuit were he looking with see upon his journey. He makes some attempt, not always successfully to elucidate various sea monster references cleverly hidden in the text of the Gerard Manley Hopkins poem, claimed by Father tongue earlier in the episode. Lastly in characteristically he ends each piece with a flourish of distinctively bewildering prose as a taut pebble head fee The best selling paperback guest was taught this seven point plan of literary composition as his Ted dubbed it. Careful, readers will still find traces of the technique and some of the potboilers that pour out of the chalet, oh prose day after day. Consider for example, even so recent to blockbuster as the Jesuit and the sea serpent, which follows the pattern almost exactly despite being over 1000 pages fat with a gold embossed cover, making it suitable for airport book kiosks.
