Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frankie and I'm sucking Apollo moment. Other mints are available. This is hooting out on the air. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour or so bit less than that. And we'll also have pansy cradled, you will be reading some excerpts from an extremely important reference work. And if you were listening to pull the plug, you will already know what that is. And if you weren't, you should have been, but you'll find out what the book is. later on in the show after I've read this. This is the story. This is me having a coughing fit. I've still got the mint in my mouth.

Frank Key  01:24
Right. Mint swallowed. This is a story about a bit of a kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn, and one man's search for the truth. Last week, there was a bit of a kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn. This was very shocking. Those of us who keep an eye on such things I used to the seemingly endless series of kerfuffles taking place at the bins by the docks. But for the bins outside the band to be targeted by the agencies of kerfuffle them was a frightening development. I had more reason than most to be concerned. I know that my reaction to the kerfuffle would be watched very closely that judgments would be made upon me. And if I did not acquit myself, Well, I might as well give up any hope I had of wallowing like a jury in the hot embrace of the bins board. Plastic was that as soon as I heard about this unexpected kerfuffle, I grabbed a rag and buffed my badge and I pinned the buff badge to my cap, and I placed the cap firmly upon my head, and I held my head erect in a manner that gave me an air of crew grit. And I clamped my pipe between my teeth, drafted my jaw and did a sort of botsman exercise, my sorry and did a set of blockman exercises, my favorite ones from the second Handbook, before jumping into my jalopy and barreling along the lines at tremendous speed, pumping my horn to scatter the various infants and small domestic animals in my path. Truly, it could be said on that October morning, with it sense of collapse. That urgency was my middle name, rather than Lembit, which was the middle name my parents, God rest their souls gave me weeks before my birth, before they knew whether I would be a boy or a girl. I was only too aware you see that the bins board was due to meet in the ceremonial chamber of the big jagad Castle that very evening on that I would be held to account. Just past sawdust bridge I swerved off into the fields, cranking the gears to no apparent purpose watch by a clump of disconsolate cows. If cows could talk, they might be able to tell me something about the kerfuffle there are lands where cows are intelligent and valuable. So I'm told, but this was not one of them. The first time I heard about such cows, I was frankly incredulous, even though I was at my mother's knee, and I had no reason to distrust that saintly woman. Later, as I accepted that she told me only that which was true, I was stricken with a sense of menace. I did not know what talking Taos talked about. But I was and remained convinced that such knowledge would shatter my brain and believe me, gibbering and twitching. Best not even to think about it. To be on the safe side, I waved a hail fellow well met greeting the nearest cow in the clump and sped onwards. Within minutes, I was pulling up at the edge of the compound where in the bins were in the band stood numinous like a monomyth.

Frank Key  05:06
Here I must make a confession. You're probably sitting there thinking how fab I am by selfless devotion to the doings of the bins board evidence of a remarkable sense of civic responsibility. Even now, you may be planning to pin up a big poster of me in the vicinity of your infant cot, or its playpen, the better to inculcated tiny cranium with my example of how to lead a valuable life in this land of worthless cows. The grammar of that last sentence might be askew, but Forgive me put it down to the attack of the vapors for you must put the drawing pins back in the drawer and never think of holding me up as an exemplar of anything but petty ambition. You say it's within the gift of the bins board to award the tenancy of a building next to the bomb and thus within the compound. And for as long as I can remember, I have been besotted by the idea of living in a compound like the Kennedys, with their famous Kennedy compound, Hyannis port or Kennebunkport or wherever the hell it is. The building next to the barn had been vacant for months. Ever since the last tenant, old man Widdecombe had been convicted of the toffee apple rapid slayings and banged up for the rest of his sordid life in a prison Hulk of a hooligans Wharf. I knew that Ben's board was struggling to agree on who was worthy to take on the tenancy. Just as I knew that this might be my last chance to live in a compound. That is why I bought my bag with such vigor and why I held my head so decisive and so decisive an angle. In truth, the prospect of winning that award was the motivation for everything I did in all my waking hours. Gorgeous lanterns hung on the perimeter fence of the compound, all filigree and glitter and stripes, adding much needed glamour to the scene. I did not. I did not have my own key, of course. And so hectic had been my dashboards the bomb, that I'd not given a thought to what faced me Now, before I could examine the site of the shocking kerfuffle by the bins, I would have to get past the bloated janitor who controlled access to the compound. I have the right of entry, the buffed bag on my cap signal that much, but the janitor was a notoriously difficult man. The two things everybody noticed about him was that he was bloated and that he was difficult. His name was Ajax, and his patrimony was squalid. To his credit, he had shaken off the sins of his fathers, and not even the faintest whiff of squalor hung around his bloated frame. Indeed, he dreamed with a climate illness that in any other janitor would have been suspicious, and his teeth were impeccable. Once I had tried to prize from him the identity of his dentist, who I was sure was a practitioner of the so called New dentistry, but he folded in upon himself in a surprisingly graceful way for so bloated a janitor and I learned nothing, nothing at all. Now, many years later, I had to hope that he would let me into the compound without any fuss, for I could not afford any delay. urgency was still my middle name. On foot justice behind the wheel of my jalopy which I had parked skillfully under the bowels of Titanic Sycamore. The sun was not shining. But if it emerged from behind the fluffy clouds, it would not shine upon my jalopy except intermittently as breezes blue, the sycamore bows, and it was important to me that this was so I'm not suggesting that there was anything vampiric about my jalopy. Or perhaps I am simply that it performs better in the dark or in the shade. I Jack's detained me at his little janitorial bunker for over an hour. He was in a garrulous mood, babbling away about a potato bass toothpaste, among other things. He was clearly taunting me for my decade ago inquiries about his dentist, but I was not amenable to his drawing, biting my lip so hard, I drew blood. I felt as if I'd been kissed by Sylvia Plath or by Ted Hughes. But both of them, I cannot remember whose fangs gouged who at their first meeting.

Frank Key  10:07
When he had had his fun with me, the bloated janitor finally allowed me to pass and I hurried over to the bins outside the barn where the kerfuffle had occurred. Post kerfuffle forensics is an inexact science. And it could fairly be said that I was flailing around in a morass of uncertainty. It would not be the first time that could be said about me. And that was why I was so tormented. I was desperate to have something concrete to present to the bins board at the meeting, which was due to begin in a few hours time. For something to do. I took a tape measure from my pocket and worked out how far from the wall of the barn the bins were. Then I walked widdershins around the barn twice, peering intently, but ignorantly the muck on the ground. Was there evidence of squirrels or a mouse or a gigantic, grotesque mutations thereof? It was hard to tell. I remember the time when one of my lungs have collapsed and I lay stricken in a clinic and with my head twisted to one side, spent hour upon hour staring out of the window, the many different types of birds that appeared in my little corner of the sky, and how very slowly, I learned to distinguish one from another and to marvel at their vibe valiant mastery of the Imperium, and that their savagery, particularly the savagery of ouled. These thoughts came sloshing through my brain. As I completed my second circuit of the bomb, and back at the bins, I tore my eyes from the mark and looked up, up into the in measure immensity of the sky. Suddenly, I was convinced beyond a smidgen of doubt, that it was up there, up in the boundless firmament that I would discover the secret of the kerfuffle by the bins outside the barn. owls might be more likely some kind of gold, ferocious gold with razor sharp beaks and talents that could tear the planet to shreds. Given that my jalopy had been seized by a subset of the ne'er do wells who looted by the compound, and who I had completely forgotten about in my urgency, and given that I thus had to catch a bus along the impossibly winding lanes to Pang Hill hot air balloon station, there to take a hot air balloon for an inspection of the sky above the barn at close quarters. It's remarkable that I managed to present myself before the bins board that evening on the dot. But I did, and I was not even disheveled. If anything, my cap was set at an even more punctilious angle than it had been earlier. And the undoing guru I had applied to my bloody lip, gave him a healthy gloss. I swear that the bins board went collectively weak at the knees, as I promised into the ceremonial chamber. Soft Light from the chandelier is falling upon me, like a sprinkling of fairy dust. I knew I was in for hard and even merciless questioning, but I felt like a champion. As the members of the bins board shuffled the papers and clear their throats. I reflected that this was my fictional athlete, bob bennett tavole moment, my triumph I fancied that I could smell the entrance porch of the building next to the barn in the compound, my compound, never again, would I be taunted by a jack the bloated janitor. I stepped onto the blue woolen mat and presented my findings to the bins board such a picture of emotion. There was a catch in my throat as I began, but I quickly recovered and delivered a masterpiece of oratory, like an ancient god booming the law. They had a few questions for me, all of which are handled within a plum that would have astonished my mother, who feared during my infancy that I would be as inarticulate as one of the cows of this precious land.

Frank Key  14:38
This morning was a torture. I fretted and jumped about waiting, waiting. The bins board announced that today, a week after the meeting, I would be informed of their adjudication in the matter of the kerfuffle down by the bend outside the barn. Cold reason told me this was their perfect opportunity to reward me the tenant See the building next to the bar. That was always how these things were done. And so I fretted and jumped about and waited and waited for posty to come skipping up the path. He was late when eventually he appeared on the far horizon, I sprinted to meet him gibbering like a Dunder pate. I snatched the bins board communique from his puny grip, sliced it open with the fiercest blade on my very fierce military knife. And I read following the unexpected and shocking kerfuffle down by the bins outside the barn, and the hot blooded and exciting report we received there upon it is our unanimous and typically Sparky decision in the matter to order the immediate demolition down to dust of the entire compound and all the buildings within it in the interest of both public safety and have a Drax the bloated janitors whim that he wants to retire to a gloomy seaside resort. Bit inactive this very day. And God bless you each and everyone.

Unknown Speaker  16:44
Hello, a few excerpts now, as promised, from a books book by a man named Rex, he bills This is a classic apparently of astrological reference books. It's called the rulership book. It was done I believe in the 1970s and Rex bless him collected astrological attributions from all over to compile this Compendium. So let's look at air air Uranus, mercury, Neptune, air compressed Uranus air hot and humid Leo air and the body and its circulation mercury air pure and clear. Libra air conditioning Jupiter Capricorn Neptune air conditioning technicians Neptune Aquarius Air Force's see Armed Forces, airline flight attendants ninth house, Moon Sagittarius

Frank Key  18:24
who knew that air conditioning technicians had their very own planetary influences or astrological Kubrick but they do in panga. You can recognize the SAT tribes because they were were plumed hat, or so I'm told in guma by contrast, perhaps of the satraps are unclaimed, and like any other hats sported by a million other humans, the sap traps can be distinguished by their tattoos. pangan satraps is true tattooing, which is reserved for their shaman, but there are no shaman in guma. If one flies over the mountains into Gar, one finds that the satraps wear plumed hats and sport tattoos, and the chief method of voting to their satrap dumb is their habit of always carrying a bundle of tally sticks. The shaman of Gar have both plumed hats and tattoos, but they do not carry tally sticks by Tiger Heron complex stylized not this much I have learned and I'm grateful to have learned from a fascinating periodical entitled satraps and shaman of panga and guma, and Gar. It is published on the first Thursday of each month, and it's packed with articles and photographs and quizzes and competitions. Since I picked up a copy at a newsagent in an Esplanade On a mezzanine level at an airport a short while ago, it has become my absolute favorite periodical ever. Even though I had no previous interest in either satraps, or shaman, whether they were from panga or goomer, or Gar or any other country you care to mention. I've been won over by the magazine's excellence in all particulars, but mostly by its vividness. It is the most vivid of periodicals more vivid even than the Reader's Digest, and punga the satraps hold councils which are discussed important meteorological issues, the pondan shaman consider the weather to fall within their purview, and this can lead to clashes between satraps and shaman. Such clashes are conducted at a strictly verbal level, and give rise to some fascinating linguistic quirks. Because there are no shaman in guma the guman satraps have the weather alter themselves and face and no clashes. In Gar, the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized not. I have said that Gar is on the other side of the mountains from panga and guma. But I have yet to learn what these mountains are called, or indeed, where they are. vivid as the periodicals is, I have to say that it's unforthcoming on matters geographical. And that's an understatement. I've been toying with the idea of writing a letter to the editor, suggesting that a future issue might include some maps. When I was a little chap, I had a passion for maps, just like the narrator of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I am no longer a little trap at all. But I would like to see maps, colorful ones of panga and guma and Gar they would make the periodical even more vivid than it already is. In panga the satraps have dominion over the birds of the air, or at least they act as if they do. They devise many laws to which the birds of the air subject flightless birds fall within the remit of the shaman of panga. They do not create laws, but they consider flightless birds to be sacred and count them often. The satraps count the birds of the air also with different purposes in mind. In guma, all known birds are poultry. In Gar, the satraps carry tally sticks are the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots.

Frank Key  22:49
I stumbled upon my first copy of the periodical in that newsagents in an Esplanade on a mezzanine level at an airport quite by accident. I was due to board a flight to a remote Prison Island, where I had been asked to sleep without the convict brains with an exciting and dangerous new fluid. I had a few minutes to spare before my flight and went to pick up the latest Reader's Digest. repair work was being done to the news agents frontage, so I had to squeeze in through a side panel, thus entering a part of the shop I would normally not have explored. Most of the racks here was stacked with fruit pastels, and pastry snacks, and I have no need of these things. For when traveling. I always bring my own food. A single copy of the September issue of satraps and shaman of panga and guma and Gar lay atop a tinderbox on the floor next to a display of packets of jammy teardrops. I picked it up out of curiosity, and was struck at once by vividness. In panga the sack draps have a counting system of astonishing complexity. It is possible what their brains are wired in a way unique to them. The shaman count as you will I would count although as you would expect they use different words for numbers. The satraps do not even use words when they count nor satraps in guba. But that is because they do not count at all. The guman satraps pipe and harm in place of counting by manufacture spikes and nails and do a lot of purposeless hammering. In Gar the satraps carry tally sticks.

Frank Key  24:46
The publishers do not make a binder available in which to keep copies of their vivid periodical. And this is another matter I planned to rise to raise in my letter to the editor recommending the company Have colorful maps. I'm extremely keen on binders for periodicals, whether or not they're vivid. It is true that I have quite a number of loose unbound periodicals in my collection. And that pains me. I numb the pain with prayer for that is what the Bishop of Southern told me to do. When some of the more excuse me,

Frank Key  25:30
when some of the more promising convict had had their brains serviced with my exciting and dangerous new fluid, I set them a project to make binders from my unbound periodicals, including satraps and shaman of panga and Goomba, and Gar, they made an excellent Fist of it with limited resources. And I like to think that the servicing had much to do with that. And panga the satraps make regular changes to the plumes in their hats according to the phases of the moon. The shaman take no notice of the moon, for they owe fealty to the sun in guma the satraps believe that the health of their poultry is dependent upon the stars. In Gar, the satraps carry tally sticks, and the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots. I have counted all my binders, and I'm carrying a tally stick. And later today, after I have watched the news bulletin and weather forecast on television, and had a little chat with the Bishop of Suffolk, I'm going to tie my hair in complex stylized knots.

Unknown Speaker  27:04
Just a few more astrological attributions to end our show tonight. Let's begin with gardens, gardeners, garden implements, Jupiter, Capricorn, fourth house, cancer, Venus, Virgo garden furniture, Venus, gardening, market, Moon Cancer, Scorpio gardens, low Scorpio, gardens public, Venus, and finally roof gardens, Libra. And that, as they say, is that

Frank Key  27:55
really is there no more.

Unknown Speaker  27:57
Or there's much much more, but I think we should save some for the future.

Frank Key  28:01
Yes, we could ponder one of the first ones there seemed to have about seven or eight different attributions. I was beginning to think that you might continue through the entire Zodiac. If that's the correct word.

Unknown Speaker  28:17
Yes, yes, it was it was getting to that point. It was getting to that point, but that was also gardens, gardeners and garden implements. Oh, I

Unknown Speaker  28:25
switch them all up and

Frank Key  28:26
learn about knitting.

Unknown Speaker  28:29
Ah, I'm sure there is one for knitting. I would have thought you'd have

Frank Key  28:33
known that already.

Unknown Speaker  28:35
You'd think I would. But I don't. Let's see if I can find it. As we speak. This is all happening live on air, which is pretty exciting. It's just

Unknown Speaker  28:45
it's a

Frank Key  28:47
reference work. Who needs explanation? Now how could it be explained? Now how could it be explained? There's nothing to explain.

Unknown Speaker  28:58
Sadly, there is nothing for knitting however, we are told that King's Lynn the city in Norfolk is it Norfolk?

Frank Key  29:06
It's a town

Unknown Speaker  29:07
it's a town in Norfolk. That's a Pisces? Apparently, it is. It's piscean

Frank Key  29:13
Have you got any other pearls of wisdom

Unknown Speaker  29:19
could be babies I think maybe that's why and as I also mentioned are they are on London of course is a Gemini.

Frank Key  29:30
What about Sydney, Australia

Unknown Speaker  29:36
looked at I'm actually looking up things this is being looked up live on air seldom happens, folks. And we've got 10 seconds. I have no idea. Let's wait and see you next time a

Okay, so that's the end of this week's show. Thanks to pansy cradle jus for that reading that very informative book. By
