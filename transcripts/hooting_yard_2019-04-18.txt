Good evening I'm resonance while I 4.4 FM resonance fm.com. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frankie. And this is more or less the 15th Anniversary Show. The first the first ever hooting yard on the air was in April, mid April 2004. And we've been on the air ever since. With gaps but no No, no kind of holiday gap just occasional gaps when I've been the worst aware or debilitated locker walls for the last couple of weeks. But continuously running now on resonance, your favorite radio station for 15. long years. amazing to think. And john sounded a bit I don't know, dubious there about the Ico nitwits. Personally, I think that the I think they're right, the only way to stop millions of people dying in the next six months is to glue yourself to Jeremy Corbyn fence. So when I finish the show, I'll be making my way in my private jet to North London, to glue myself to Jeremy Corbyn fence. And while we're there, me and the other and the other glue people will no doubt discuss the fact that one of the I like the fact that one of the organizers of whatever is called eco nitwit rebellion. What was it he said that no one should be able to allow to fly and only the only flights available should be in an emergency. And then it transpired his Instagram feed is full of pig photographs of him in various foreign locations on holiday. nylon. No doubt he no doubt he swam. Anyway, anyway, eco networks I think it Yes, me and pansy cradle drew who's with me today got here, in spite of in spite of them, and very glad to be here and I'm not going to read you a story called fiends of the farm yard. That is or might have been an old superstition that every farm yard has its own fiend. It is said that Beelzebub personally allotted each fiend to a farm yard and ratcheted up the fiendish pneus of his dastardly plan by making the fields extremely hard to identify. So for example, neighboring farmyard may have very different resident fiend, a pig here, an old rusty iron pail there, a one legged hand in one farm yard, and a big bright red tractor belching smoke in another. exorcising a farm yard of its feet. This is fraught with difficulty. For the average countryside Exorcist, stepping through the gate of a farm yard for the first time does not know where to begin to look. There is a great disparity in the fiendish pneus of farmyard fiends and some diabolist have argued that Beelzebub treated the whole matter with an uncharacteristic lack of diabolic concentration. For every farmyard, that is stricken by an energetic field. There are many more that can pass for years, even decades in untroubled, bucolic peace. But of course, it's the form of that gain attention. Who can forget the ruination visited upon screwin hoon, Puj farmyard in the 1930s all those crop failures, diseases, fires, murders, contaminations, and inextricable bond collapses, which ceased only when a marauding nighttime squirrel was captured in a net by Father Dermot Boggess and subjected to the full rigor of his holy rough

Frank Key  05:00
It took six months for the exorcist to expel every last vestige of fiendish pneus from the squirrel, leaving the poor, bushy tailed mammal thin and shriveled and exhausted and close to death. And yet, as it was slowly revived by the coddling of alma purgative at her verdant squirrel sanctuary, so too, did the farm yard. flourish a new with majestic fields of golden wheat, gleaming new buckets, replacing the old rusty pails and the happy pigs. You would be forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard fiends is precisely the kind of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed, marigold to often pressed him to tackle a topic, supplying the out of print pamphleteer with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations of an agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the One popular monthly magazine, glimpses of farmyard ruin, and write many letters to the editor, some of which were published, and one of which October 1954 was selected as letter of the month, for which marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize was a very large hog with a brain disease, which went on wild rampages through the house. mischievously, the editor of the magazine, who had his own farm yard regularly used the monthly prize to rid himself of his farm yard fiends is yes, note the plural. What happens you will ask when a fiend of the farmyard is identified and destroyed, whether by slaughter, exorcisms or being given away as a prize in a raffle tombola or by some other means, as happened with marigold dudes, Gruen hunahpu farmyard, stay fiend free. Once it's sinister squirrel habits demons cast out how attentive was BLT Bob, to the welfare of those he had sent to wreak havoc in our buskey rural domains. Were new fiends recruited and trained to carry out various infernal farmyard acts of fiendish pneus. These and other questions were answered by Father Dermot Boggess himself. In his deathbed ravings, carefully transcribed by his wrinkled old help meet the widow popsicle. among the thousands of pages she scribbled, we find this startling passage. God, God, inexplicable torment of the devil's long poking fork, is the legal Cataclysm of shuttering a basement in the pit. And when did you last see your potatoes? God? Have the fields been hold? I see hundreds of cows, thousands of cows, millions of cows, brutes, the flames of the fiery furnace, a crow on the branch of a dead tree blast of lightning, no diesel from the tractor, blight blight. Worms eating the flesh of resurrected horses. Never resurrect a horse never pass me that feeble lamp puzzles of Slotkin, slop and constant rainfall 40 days and 40 nights flooded fields, the wheat ruined ergot poisoning a gruesome finger in the shroud of death. Find me a lonely Cove remote from humankind. Dark as the midnight grave and dismal as my mind guy, and is there honey still for tea? And with that last brief flash of lucidity, the remembered words of john Eccles. 1665 to 1757 father bogguss relapsed into inanity 400 pages worth of the widow popsicles. palsy pencils scroll the clue to the farmyard fiends danabol resilience is, I think, in that reference to the CRO perched on the branch of a dead tree. Dawn is near the sun will soon be lighting your path to the far flung fields. Go and tail and plow and herro feed your horses and your cows and you're happy happy pigs. You might spit upon your farmyard fiend it will pass to you no more. It was only ever a superstition or it might have been

Club footed taught winds heroism cup Come on footed taught wind heroism cup. This was the headline on the front page of the daily brouhaha, which first brought tiny Enid to national attention. Until then, heroic exploits were no nine new to a few. Her intervention in the case of the gormless Nipa changed all that, at least for a while, until the fad or frippery came along to divert the fickle public. Yet some of us have not forgotten the heroic infant, and is important, but a new generation be reminded of her deeds. The gormless Nipa was roughly the same age as tiny Enid and have roughly the same diminutive stature, but otherwise the pair of the modern inhabited different planets were tiny Enid was heroic. The Nipa was gormless were tiny. Enid showed valor, gusto and lashing and and were tiny Enid showed valla gusto and dash the nipper with gormless gormless gormless? The nipper was raised in an orphanage, not unlike Pang Hill orphanage. It was a monstrous black brick building, rock crumbling upon a hillside. One winter's day the gormless nipper was leaning out of a window, gazing gormlessly at the sky when he fell, landing in a gormless heap in the snow. Instead of trudging back to the huge iron door of the orphanage, and wrapping his tiny fists upon it until the kindly matron met him back in. But gormless Nipa wandered off, away from his grim black brick home ever further away until he was quite lost. Thus began a series of accidents and misadventures, which befell him due to his gormless pneus, stopping to rest at eye level crossing is cravat was singed by sparked from a passing locomotive. When he made to undo the Corvette to look more closely at the singeing. He half strangled himself and lost consciousness. swooning, he fell forward so that the very top of his head almost touched the railway track. And when a second locomotive thundered past seconds later, he received an inadvertent haircut, his locks torn out by the screeching metal train wheels. Had he had a mirror when he woke from his swoon, the gormless Nipa would have seen that he now had the appearance of a tonsured friar. He roamed onwards, crossing the tracks and fell into a pond. miniscule aquatic beings within the pond, attached themselves to his skin and borrowed through to his innards were like fed upon his tissue and squirted out pond venom. They were microscopic beings, actual size, so the gormless nipper was unaware of their parasitic sucking and squirting and the amounts of pond venom was so infinitesimally small that even the most advanced scientific apparatus would be unable to detect them. Nevertheless, he began to feel off color, and when eventually the venom reached his brain, it had the effect of increasing or rather, alleviating, is gormless illness,

Frank Key  14:16
increasing rather than alleviating his normlessness. Then if I slept that night in a Baya surrounded by cows, discovered dawn by a florid faced farmer, it was set to work pulling a plow through a field. The winter sun blazed on his tonsor and turned to snow to slash. And by the time he was done plowing the Nipa socks was soaking wet. He took them off and hung them up to dry on what he thought was a washing line. Alas, it was an electricity cable running from the farmer's generator to a new fangled power spade, and the gormless nipper was jolted by a shock. have sufficient voltage to make him queasy. So when shortly afterwards, the farmer fed him a bowl of soup. He vomited it up all over the freshly laundered farm yard kitchen table cloth, an heirloom embroidered with unbelievable delicacy by the farmers great great grandmother. Understandably furious, the farmer, the gormless netta, all the way down the line into the village square at screwin hunahpu and abandoned him they're dazed and sore, still queasy, and with the pond venom coursing through his vitals. The gormless Nipa slumped against the plinth, the village beetle found in their tonsils and sockless and weed sick on his sleeve, and accused him of defiling the statue of frizzy head minstrel Leo Sayer atop the plains, which was the pride of the village thrown into a dungeon that never slept fitfully that night in the company of mice and beetles. The next morning, the beetle had the beetle handed the gormless Nipa over to a brute to whom he would be apprenticed for the next six months. day in day out, the brute sent Magneto to the bottom of the sea and his bat escape from where he had to plunge into deep sea trenches and collect bio luminescent organism organisms. The goggles of his diving suit did not fit snugly, and the gormless netta gradually began to lose his sight. When he was almost blind. He the brute wrote him out to sea and left him marooned on a welcome crusted rock. And there he may have perished were it not for tiny Enid. One day eager to do a heroic deed, She sailed aloft in her hot air balloon and spotted the gormless Nipa weekly trying to prize the very vast wealth from the rock. Rightly judging that he was far too puny and famished to hoist himself up and the rope he might dangle down to him. Timing Enid set her burners roaring and ascended high enough to snap to snap accumulate. tying a quickly scribbled message to the birds leg, she propelled it in the direction of the air Sea Rescue station, sent bibley did did, then descended again until she was in shouting distance of the gormless Nipa. See anok gormless nipper, she cried. I am tiny Enid and I have alerted the air Sea Rescue station at some bibbity babe to your sorry plight. By attaching a message to the leg of accumulate, the bird is flying its little heart out even as we speak. And soon a lovely big lifeboat will scatter across the waves to rescue you. preserve your energy and stop trying to prize that last welke from the rock. For soon you will be sitting at my kitchen table wolfing down a slap up hot dinner of non seafood items.

And sorry, it was that nine months to the day since he had fallen from the orphanage window into the snow. The gormless nipper returned is grim black brick home. He was driven there by tiny Enid herself in a higher Ciara bank on the day after she was awarded a 10 cap for heroism. The gormless nipper had managed not to be sick all over time, the Enid tablecloth and a few eyedrops from her mysterious cabinet had restored his sight. The hair had grown back roads been ripped out by the locomotive, and his heroic rescuer selflessly gave him a pair of her own socks to replace the ones still hanging neglected from the farmers electricity cable had tiny indeed known that the Nipa was riddled with microscopic aquatic parasites, squirting pond venom, no doubt she would have found a way of exterminating them. She was that kind of girl.

One Christmas I know this is unseasonal, but one Christmas channel for all the BBC broadcasts The so called Liverpool network Presumably a wretched attempt at making the story of the birth of the Christ relevant to today's feckless Britons or at least to their northern segment. hooting yard we have no such track with such total, but that you would not have watched. But no you would not have watched the Liverpool Nativity, you might be diverted by a brief account of the pointy town Nativity, an annual jamhuri which has nothing to do with the Christ as such, the birth is celebrated is that of a pig, the firstborn pig on screen who pood farmyard after the feast of Saint loopy and known throughout the succeeding year as the new pig. Much to the consternation of the pointed founders, adherents of various religions have taken offense that there be no those big but let's face it with books, the Bible, the Torah and the Quran. Each get into a bit of a flap about pigs, deriding them as unclean, abominable, cloven hooves, beasts of the country, pigs a charming, intelligent, lovable, and delightful animals. And it is well known that leaning over the fence of a pigsty and watching pigs for an hour a day is one of the most relaxing activities known to humankind. You would be astonished at the kerfuffle caused a year or so ago, when the new pig was given the name Muhammad, which was viewed and pointed out as a compliment. Any name attached to a pig is thereby raised above the level of everyday Dennis's and Edna's and Demi Lee's and Kylie's a similar but less violent reaction occurred when the new pig was named Jesus. But that's unlikely to be repeated due to the Gibbs sonian practice of dropping the J word and referring simply to the Christ. Pig nomenclature has become something of a minefield then, but that does not deter the good people have pointed town who have a healthy and positive attitude to their pigs. The celebration of the birth of the new pig being the proof of the pudding. I'm not entirely sure that last phrase means anything, or at least that it means what I intended to mean, but I would ask the listeners to get some companies some slack. Also loot these days itself the pregnant pigs have screwed whom food farmyard I gathered in a special piggery unit. Part of an enormous bond decorated for the occasion with flags and bunting and embroidered pork crates of st loopy. roaring sawtooth Jack's from pointing down aerodrome screech across the sky and a series of flight paths and dozens of dirigibles lube over the bomb. Meanwhile, the current soon to be displaced new pig is given a crate of crab apples and conference pears to feast upon. There is much worse Ireland drop commodity especially near the caves where the pointy town cave dwelling troglodytes curiosity is sparked barked, and they creep into the light for the only time in a 12 month. Outside the post office, a person upon a podium reads passages from the pointy town pig Chronicle, recalling past new pigs and their names from the controversial Mohammed and Jesus to less troublesome ones such as popsy who did breath kept out battle poopy Christopher Plummer durveys and winnifred A hopelessly overqualified veteran a resurgent keep the BVI on the pregnant pigs, ready to relay news of the first whelping via a pneumatic communications tube to the point your town pig Nativity announcer. There is danced by music, much crumpet tree, the eating of milk slops, conjuring tricks, chanting cattle, caterwauling hysteria and shamanistic fire dancing. over by the pointy town potato patch. Raw potatoes are carved into piggy shapes by trained potato carving experts. And when eventually the new pig is born, a hash descends upon the town from screwin hunahpu farmyard to the horrible caves, while the pointy town is wait to hear the chosen name. the naming of the new pig

Frank Key  24:44
is a solemn contrast of the rowdy celebrations which preceded so solemn indeed the the silence is broken now and then by the sounds of sobbing and weeping and the rending of garments. Eventually, a designated Often child will pluck a name out of thin air and painted with a dangerous lead based paint on the outside of the barn. And thus, the pointy town activity comes to a close as the new pig is given gifts, brandhub scrapings, and the old new pig is led away to an ordinary STI and the townspeople tragic back to their daily drudgery and the planet continues to spin up on its axis to no apparent purpose.

Frank Key  25:51
Well, I think that's gonna have to be the end of this week's show because there's only a few minutes left which is not long enough for me to read anything to you. So I could babble for for a while, or maybe pansy cradle drew could bring us up to date on her latest knitting project, which is being carried out live in the studio. Remember, hooting out is probably the only show which features alive and knitting nearly every week.

Unknown Speaker  26:22
I'm sure there are many other shows that feature live knitting almost every week.

Frank Key  26:26
I don't think you'd hear

Unknown Speaker  26:27
about them. We just

Frank Key  26:29
but we do hear about them either on resonance

Unknown Speaker  26:32
we do. And currently knitting a collar out of silk which is a good good fiber to use for summer. It's kind of cool or commerce cool.

Frank Key  26:43
Yes, collar for the pig cow.

Unknown Speaker  26:45
I suppose. I hadn't considered giving it to a pig but I might do that.

Frank Key  26:51
A dead pig that's had its brain cells reactivated four hours later. I have you heard about this?

Unknown Speaker  26:57
I have not.

Frank Key  26:58
Oh yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:59
that pig.

Frank Key  27:01
Franken pigs fine can be scientists. mad scientists often mad boffins have reactivated the brain of a pig in a fight in its head, which has been removed, which should be applauded, I think.

Unknown Speaker  27:22
So we're going to have to come up with a lot more pig names, I guess. Well, or the good people

Frank Key  27:29
of crew noon Puj farmyard,

Unknown Speaker  27:32
we'll have to do so. Yes. I'll settle for dressing.

Frank Key  27:36
You can give them knitted collars. And yeah, I learned more about I well come on the zombie pig overlords. Well, yeah. Is it still alive? No. It's just a bit of electrical activity. I was I was unclear why I had to decap excuse me, why I had to decapitate the pig before revitalizing it. Because if it did come back as a zombie, it might run after you.

Unknown Speaker  28:11
Got the walking dead pigs.

Frank Key  28:15
Yes. A new TV series. I think I was gonna suggest going back briefly. And while I was gonna suggest that zombie, dead zombie pigs could trace all the Eco nitwits away from Central London locations. But it did strike me that you know that one of the things has been that the police aren't arresting them because I haven't got enough cells to put them in. Well, I caught to make what they should do. You put them into vans, drive them out to the countryside and dump them in field. They'd be happier. They should be happy. Why should we give them a spade and a hoe? And they could stop. How they get back to Hampstead. Well, they wouldn't be about to confiscate their smart fund.

Unknown Speaker  29:16
They can raise zombie pigs.

Frank Key  29:18
Yeah. Yeah, give them something useful to do. And it might it might merely be time for this show to come to a merciful end. Yeah, there's only so anyway, so I hope you've enjoyed it. And it seemed to be a lot about pigs and farm yard in there. But I didn't realize that beforehand. But never mind. As I say it's the 15th anniversary of the show. So that's I'm being told to wind up wound up thank you to pansy Cray
