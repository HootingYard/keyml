Good evening and welcome to hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And this is the first show of 2008. So a new year, a new year for hooting yard. And traditionally the tanager is the new year bird of hooting yard. A small to medium sized member of the bird family threw up a dye. The tanager picks insects off branches often has a rather dull song and lives in a cup nest on a tree branch. Sometimes the cup can be almost globular, but that's a tanager for you. Because it's a tropical bird flocks of tanagers are incredibly rare in the sky around hemoglobin towers, so the majority of hooting yards New Year tanager birds are made of paper or cardboard. Well, all of them. The Making of paper or cardboard birds often very elaborate ones, but sometimes really quite shoddy and slapdash has long been found to be a splendid way of keeping the tinies of Pang Hill orphanage busy during the winter night, when other more fortunate children are fast asleep. Throughout the month of December, the orphanage attic open to the freezing and black night sky rings out with the jolly cries of infants competing with each other to craft the very best paper or cardboard tanager using shredded newspaper or crumpled cartons, or torn up popsy the pig annuals donated by a foundlings charity. These lads are eagerly grasped by the larger and more lumbering orphans. For the pretty colored pictures of poxy. The pig and her pals make for splendid plumage on the paper birds. On New Year's Eve, each tiny collapses with exhaustion on the floor of the attic, and a trio of worthies roams among their fallen little bodies, destroying all but one of the paper or cardboard tanagers with hammers and slices. The sole surviving paper bird is carried off for the hooting yard festivities that begin at dawn on New Year's Day, by which time the orphans have been bundled downstairs and locked into the filthy infested canteen for their breakfast of cauliflower, water and radishes.

And next up, we have a request. I'm reading this pieces of request because it was pointed out there's quite an old story, but it was pointed out it's never been available on a hooting yard podcast or not in its entirety. So I'm going to read it now. It's called gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, part one September 1894. I had been marooned on the island for 11 weeks when I discovered the drug antic Bolivian architectural diagrams, rolled into a metal canister and wedged in a narrow crevice between two rocks, taking a swig for my bag of turtles blood. I squatted on the ground and removed the diagrams from the canister. There were about a dozen large sheets rather frayed around the edges but perfectly legible. The top left corner of a sheet had been stamped with an official device of the Bolivian administration showing an escutcheon a ziggurat, the helmet of a Conquistador the hand of God and abbreviations and neat metallic lettering. The signature of what is supposed to be a petty official had been scratched across each of the stamps in move, ink munching or whelk, I turned my attention to the diagrams themselves. They were fearfully complicated. I am no architect, and at first all I could make outward mariadb lines meeting of angles and criss crossing each other seemingly at random. Most of the diagrams had been subjected to revision, and there was much evidence of erasure over printing and churlish emendation myself Saudis were interrupted by a sudden and ferocious thunderstorm, shoving the diagrams hastily back into the canister. Unfortunately tearing one of them. I hobbled back to my shelter, where my Viper was busy biting the head off an unidentified rodent. tossing my crutches into the corner. I lay back on my palate and spent a profitable hour mucking about with bits of wire and driftwood to make a trap for bat. The life of a maroon on an island such as this is not unpleasing food is plentiful and easily gathered or slaughtered. The vegetation is lush and the animals are slow witted and trusting. On my very first day, I was able to bash out the brains of a badger which traveled innocently towards me as I sat on the beach idling with my club. Quite what a badger was doing on the island is beyond me. I have not come across any others. But I am ever vigilant. I will not risk boring you by listing the stupendous array of equipment I managed to salvage from the wreck of the HMS Tata of magnesium. Suffice to say the club was not my only weapon, nor am I what I am is a loss for a change of trousers. I've told you that I'm not an architect. The truth is, I cannot remember what I am. What trade or business I followed on dry land. Perhaps I was a jolly jack tar, but I think it's unlikely. I like to think that I was aboard the top of magnesium as a supernumerary passenger, a merchant of salt my see that you can tell this is a live program because I was about to turn the page and I turned over two pages. So I'm going to begin that sentence again. I like to think that I was aboard the top of magnesium as a supernumerary passenger, a merchant of sorts. My cabin crammed with samples of tea or silk or mustard. In the final desperate moments as the ship pitched and rolled and smashed against gleaming rocks. I received a blow to the head which has impaired my memory. It was not the only injury I received. My right leg is only just recovering. I was thankful that among the first items from the ship washed up on the beach was a wooden box of sinner prisms from the surgeon's casket. In the first days of my marooning. The lifeless bodies of my shipmates were washed up on shore, white, puffed gruesome, I kicked off the dead in an impromptu ledger, which I have since mislaid the bodies did not lie there long, enormous birds swooped out of the sky, hooked the dead in their beaks and bought them off. their nests are not on this island. I have searched every inch of it. The gigantic Bolivian

architectural diagrams came to light on one of my earliest researches. For the first few weeks I was so sure of being rescued by a passing smack or schooner that I could barely bring myself to move. I sprawled on the beach, knocking out the brains of a variety of curious animals, applying syllogisms to my wounds, and gashes and covering myself with an old bit of sail cloth at night, or during rainfall. At last a ship Hove interview, I hopped about like a mad thing shouting and raving and Latin, following the advice of my Jesuit mentors. Eventually, I realized that the craft I was hailing was nothing other than what was left of the Tata of magnesium seen from an advantageous angle. If dear listener, you were expert in tides and currents in the pleasingly complex science of the movement of seeds. I would ask you how it was that there's broken record of a ship sailed about for nine or 10 weeks without sinking only returned to the spot where razor sharp rocks hidden beneath the waves had pierced its fabric and brought about it do that but I suspect you will not. It was at this stage that I conquered my indolence and set to work. In 48 hours I salvaged everything I could carry from the ship constructed a raft knocked up a shelter from planks and sail cloth knocked up another shelter when the first one collapsed on top of me, this time shoring up the sides with some sort of metal, killed eight turtles made a store for bucket dug some holes lost my death ledger, a typical rain I found in the surgeon's casket and hardly pulls for sleep. The next day I began my search of the island, I found a Mulberry Bush and some gemstones. On the second day I found bauxite deposit a waterfall, big grains of sand and what looked like the bones of a horse. On the third day, I found the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. On the fourth day I found a crushed encampment of beetles and a cave full of one full of the most loathsome bats I had ever seen. So it went on day after day. In two weeks, I had covered the island. All the while I had been making careful notes, and now I rested and spent my days drawing and it's quizzically detailed map. I tacked this up above my palate. As night fell in my blubber, candles spluttered. I lay back and considered my island home. With nary a smack or spoon insight. I could remain marooned here for years on end, my shelter might not last buffeted as it was by howling winds and freezing rain. I decided that the best place for me to live would be the cave. I declared war on the backs

gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, part two January 1911. I had been marooned on the island for just two days when I discovered the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. They were spattered with blood rolled up and jammed into a rotting wooden casket. I carried them back to my heart to examine them. There were about a dozen large sheets rather frayed around the edges but perfectly legible. The top left corner of each sheet had been stamped with an official device of the Bolivian administration showing in a sketch in a ziggurat, the helmet of a Conquistador the hand of God and abbreviations in neat metallic lettering. The signature of what are supposed to be a petty official had been scratched across each of the stamps in most ink. I could not understand why they were in such good condition. I tacked them up on the walls of my heart, where they rapidly grew so familiar that I no longer notice them. I'm no architect and I had more urgent matters to attend to. I have never forgiven myself for my stupidity. I have been warned not to roll my skiff into uncharted waters near the Antarctic Circle. Oh, but did I listen as Captain Peabody harangued me, You damned fool, he shouted his frosty whiskers twitching in the cold morning light. I turned for one last look at the ship as I guided my skiff into oblivion. I have not seen a human face since that day. Within minutes, I was overwhelmed by killing poisonous mist. The hideous stench of crocus's made me sick to my stomach. I left for the ores, the souls tampered with by my enemies, glob and muffin fell to pieces and the oars floated away out of reach. I drifted for hours. My anorak with its hood of reindeer hide froze solid in casing me so that I was unable to move an inch, an orc or some such February in great shat on me repeatedly hovering above my head like a malign shade. I could not move to shoo it away. Eventually, mercifully, I passed out. When I came to I was surrounded by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. One of them with icicles forming on the brim of his hat was solicitously offering me a tin mug of brandy. I took the Grateful swig, then noticed that his colleagues did not seem so friendly. They were glaring at me with a menace. One brandished a rather archaic halberd in a in the air and shouted horrifying words. All of a sudden, I became aware that I was aboard a huge shiny boat, its sales billowing its deck scrubbed clean. I turned to look again at the Mountie with the tin mug. For the first time I took in his features. It was mufon my deadly enemy. There were other hallucinations, other dreams. I shall not repeat them here. hours days, perhaps weeks after I'd set out in my skiff. I came at last to dry land again when I woke to find myself sprawled on the beach of this island. Was it yet another Phantasm there were a number of ways to find out. I tried three of them. First I beat my head upon some boulders. This caused what seemed like real pain. Then I shoveled handfuls of coarse sand into my mouth and attempted to swallow. This caused me to wreck uncontrollably for some minutes. Almost satisfied I conducted a third test. Taking from the breast pocket of my anorak a small file, I poured a miniscule quantity of a decoction of sandalwood, crease all gutta percha and pitch into the palm of my hand, held it aloft in the salty air and mumbled incantations and jibberish sparks crackled in my hair shot up into the sky and brought tiny jewels of hail pinging down around me. Within seconds, they evaporated and were gone. But now I knew for certain that I was working Wide awake, no longer prayed of visions and vapors. Being a resourceful sought, I managed to provide myself with adequate food, drink, warmth and shelter within a few hours, I began to search my temporary home and found the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. That was over a month ago. I found the remains of my skiff, crushed and broken swept up on some rocks on the northern coast, which seemed to be the wildest. I have been working hard at my Almanac, and that keeping my beacons late

last night as I held dried and matted vegetation upon my northern beacon, I was attacked by a swarm of bats. They swooped at me one after another, squealing horribly, pecking at my flesh. I fought them off with a burning stick, but I was shaken. I ran back to my heart and blocked up the doorway and some of the holes in the walls with mulberry paste. Tonight, the back to back chewing their way frenziedly through the walls. I have on my rickety homemade desk a small bag of sulfur bombs with which I hope to fight them off. But timing will be crucial. I do not intend to perish

gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams Part Three October 1928. We adopted our 800 hours. bingo card. linnet frac and pin mouth were detailed to search the northern half of the island while vieweg Shem drabber, Thorpe and myself took the South. I left wicket and bird whole aboard the ship with strict instructions. I cannot remember what the instructions were. But they were strict. Make no mistake about that. The five of us who comprise the southern party set out it rapidly became apparent that the boulders and rocks on the island we're giving off violent magnetic discharges, the tension was oppressive. We saw what looked like ball lightning far in the distance. I instructed buke to make sketches in his little pad, but he complained that his pencil was blunt. Between us we could not muster a pencil sharpener. I was loath to have vieweg return to the ship alone to fetch the required implement, so I instructed jabber to accompany him. I pressed on with Sherman thurb. The latter carefully scraping rock and mud samples into our canister path ahead was burned and scorched by what agency was not clear to us. At Oh 950 hours bird whole joined our party. She brought with her the ship's pencil sharpener. Apparently buke had suffered an attack of the seeds and was having a lie down in his cabin. I made a mental note to tick him off later. I remember that clearly. Because at the very moment i thought id and mighty crevasse opened in the ground directly in front of us. Ferb was swallowed up as the earth cracked apart. The rest of us staggered backwards. I'm glad that I had the presence of mind to tell bird hold to execute a quick sketch in buchs pad. She complained that she had not yet had a chance to sharpen the pencil, but I cut her short with a screech of blood curdling ferocity. One is taught to do that sort of thing at officer school. shim put down her accordion and made an impromptu bridge across the crevasse using all our footwear tied together. We clambered across and pressed on. Although not before birdhouse, had insisted upon holding a commemorative service for the sadly departed thurb why I allowed it I do not know. I can be a sentimental old buzzard. While bird hole was you Yulia lighting. We were joined by the northern party who had completed their investigations. Other than some extremely fascinating magnetic readings, ornithological discoveries, amateur geological observations, a net full of moths and a worm count. They had nothing to report. I commanded frac or PIN mouth, I never could tell them apart, to return to the ship, but I cannot remember why. whichever one it was sent drabber back to us. I had suspected her idling around like bude but she made haste to tell me that she had Castor, Mackenzie, baby From the ship, I patted her on the head, not without some misgivings, as I do not think she had ever washed her hair. That last birdhouse stopped howling and we pressed on, with past an enormous heap of skeletons, battened human. According to Bengals, eagle eyed diagnosis, and various other manifestations of what la mouche calls last FLAC de la more. I have jabber thank for that quotation. Berto wanted to delay further to give the two human skeletons a decent krisztian burial, but I kept her on the temples and now that the ground over which we passed became rough and spiky, and we had to tread carefully in our socks. We would retrieve our tough adventure as boots on our return trip, when we would be able to dismantle shim this bridge, frac or PIN mouth handed around some custard balls for sustenance. Then, as we hacked our way through some overhanging foliage, we suddenly came face to face with the building. It was smaller than we expected, like a scale model of a typical 19th century Bolivian civic Hall, and it had all the hallmarks of having been constructed out of bat droppings. I removed my hat in or the others did likewise, except for Shem, who was not wearing a hat linnet, whose hat had snagged on the branch of a Dunstable tree a few hundred yards back and bird hole, whose hadn't been glued to her head for the duration of the expedition for some obscure religious purpose. I had interrogated her on this point back at 10 Tara beam and will publish the documents separately. Of course, we could not stand around like a bunch of clots

all day. I've jammed my hat back on my head and commanded my team to get to work. I was heartened to see that they set to it with such gusto. Within minutes, the instrument had been unpacked the music standard setup sheet music distributed, and everyone was at their post ready to tune up. The band was as follows bingo on bugle card on bassoon, shame on accordion Jabba on sackbut linnet on harmonium, frac or PIN mouth on caster nets, and bird hold on handbells. I myself conducted and played the Cournot we ran through a few bars of bring me your winding sheet, oh mother of mine, before settling down to the concert proper mackerels shrieked, but we drowned them out. We played my arrangements of the seven last words from the cross, Haydn Salatin bureaucratic Satti and the anti abolitionist riots Ives for an uncle we performed a rousing version of the consumptive vest, jabber arranged bird Hall. Then we packed up I ordered bird hall to make some detailed sketches of the buildings in buchs little pad, and we also took measurements and poked about the place a bit. But night would soon be falling, and there was no let up in the magnetic magnetic magnetic activity of this a cursed Island. The sooner we returned to the ship, the better. The journey back passed without incident. We collected our boots after recrossing shims bridge over the chasm. Third body had fallen so far, it was not visible. We did not tarry, wicket and pin mouth or frac were on duty on the bridge. They had received warnings of volcanic activity over the radio. Before we set sail, I went into Butte cabin and told him I would Brook no further nonsense from him. I presented him with a rag and told him to go and polish everything on the ship. Back on deck I found linnet mucking about with the McKenzie beam. I let it pass. I was a tired woman. We weighed anchor and headed home at last. Only later did I discover that I had left my kornet on the island. I cannot bear to go back there to retrieve it.

So that was a special request. That was written many years ago. I can't remember how many years ago but sometime in the last century. This however, was written a couple of days ago. Blodgett decided he wanted to live in a Schloss. So he did the sensible thing and went to an estate agent who specialized in shorties or SRA, awesome. What I'm looking for he demanded in his demanding way, is somewhere bleak and forbidding and in accessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable food hotel or gondola lift. If you've seen the film, where Eagles dare, directed by Brian De Hatton and released in 1968, you will have a good idea of what I'm talking about a state agent. That is not a film I have seen, replied the estate agent and impossibly youthful and pimply person who was terrified of Goddard for reasons he was as yet only dimly aware of. I'm not much of a cinema goer at all. He continued, for I prefer to spend my leisure hours at the circus bloodroot had strong views on surfaces, but so intent was he on viewing at least a couple of schlossman with a view to purchasing one of them. Then he decided not to be right to the estate agent just yet. I pox upon circuses was all he said, and then asked the pimply person if there were any suitable schlossman on his books, at which point he was handed a big fat leather bound Lawson brochure and invited to thumb through it, which he did for about 15 minutes, occasionally making strange noises and thumping his fist on the estate agents desk. Outside birds landed on the branch of the tree and began to squawk and sing. The pimple youth was growing increasingly nervous of Blodgett, so he reached into his drawer for a can of pepper spray. He'd only used it once to disable a ruthian bent on criminality on a Wednesday morning. Now it was Wednesday morning again, and he was faced with this bad tempered giant of a man and a humbug hat and unseasonal galoshes, who was perhaps using Schloss purchase as a blind for some evil deed. Though what that deed might be the estate agent did not know in truth. Blodgett was perfectly serious in his intention to buy our Schloss. Although he had not worked out how in the name of heaven, he was going to pay for it. That was why he wanted it to be bleak and forbidding and inaccessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable food hotel or gondola lift for them. Once inside for viewing, he would simply stay put and pull up his ramparts, and defend himself against any bailiffs or law officers by pelting them with burning rags. It was not that he did not intend to pay the full Schloss purchase price eventually, for at heart he was an honest man, but he wanted to be in his floss, while devising our money making scheme which would allow him to pay for it. Meanwhile, as he gazed at the pages of the floss brochure with Greely eyes, he continued to thump his fist on the desk, because that's the sort of man he was. Outside the tree on the branches of which little birds squawked and sang was being chopped down by an inept municipal tree cropping man. Not only was he chopping down the wrong tree, but the direction of his chopping when the when it fell, it fell slap bang into the Schloss specialist, a state agency, and it fell, smashing the glass frontage at precisely the moment that the pimply youth, unnerved by yet another thump of Blodgett fist upon his desk, pointed the pepper spray at blogilates face and sprayed him, at which point also one of the thicker branches of the tree falling landed with a mighty bash upon the youths head, brining him into a daze. The birds had flown away to the branches of another tree and was squawking and singing still. Fast it was that bloodroot ended up at a clinic they have the pepper spray rinsed out of his eyes, while the estate agent lay in a bed elsewhere in the same clinic having his brain examined. It is hardly surprising then that Blodgett failed to buy a bleak and forbidding Schloss one inaccessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable food hotel or gondola lift on that Wednesday morning on squawk.

So that's the end of the first hooting out on the air of 2008. And I'll be back next week with with john o parafin, among other things, bye bye
