6:30pm on Thursday, it must be hooting out on the air. Unless of course you're listening to the repeat on Monday morning, or to the podcast at some unknown future date. Anyway, this is hooting album yet My name is Frankie, and I'm going to read you for approximately 28 and a half minutes. The town of throne is perhaps best known for its gorgeous sewers, with their chandeliers, rikako ironwork railings and jewel encrusted access ladders. In spite of the magnificence of their sewers, the throne persons fought hard to win that official designation as a town. It is after all, the size of a village with the atmosphere of a Hamlet and the public morals of a cluster of shabby huts. But town it now is at least on paper and bursting with civic pride. The mayor's train of office hangs around his neck and trails along the ground into the gutter where it drops through a brightly polished grating down deep down into the most subterranean of the sewers, where it is bolted to an adamantine slab of rock and bolted fast. It is a long train a train the mayor is proud to wear the end of his term. The soldiering person will come and unfastened it from around his neck. And it's at this time is 10 years jutti done and loosed from his train. The EX Mayor might make a trip to BOCES. Some have mistakenly dubbed BOCES, the Twin Town of throne. It is no such thing. It is neither town nor village, nor Hamlet, nor even a cluster of hearts. It certainly has no sewers to rival throng. It has no sewers at all, for it's the kind of place that though rained upon incessantly has always been shunned by drainage engineers. So To the untrained eye, boaters can look like a mere midden of modern filth and muck roosted upon by the occasional disoriented scavenger goal or vulture. This unseemly prospect conceals, however, the great attraction of boatus which draws throng persons to it week in week out through the winter month. BOCES is registered as a site of historical significance, for it was here at the dawn of time that the Lord appeared carrying an enormous burlap sack. There are many versions of the story, but the essential details of covered by Abby Farwell brown in her The Curious book of birds from 1903. And I quote, one day, the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all the beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, and locust grasshoppers and other creatures who fly or hop or crawl and shut them up in a huge sack. Well tide at the end. What a queer squirming, muffled buzzing bundle it made to be sure. Then the Lord called the woman to him and said, woman, I would have you take this sack and throw it into the sea. This Lord has been erroneously identified as the God of the Christians. But recent scholarship carried out at the BOCES Institute of insect history has put a pretty firm kibosh on that idea. It now seems certain that the Lord referred to was actually a native of throne, or what passed for throne in those distant days, and may have been the same Lord who dug the very first shaft of what was to become the fantastic sewage system. We know much more about the woman who was entrusted with the sack. She was a Bossa sight of the higher peasantry in rayment of turquoise with bells on her fingers and bells on her toes, and made fun of baffles and puffers and woad. Her name we think, was cloth guard.

Last is the close link between thrombosis explained. Although one puzzling aspect of the tale is that both town and midden a foreign land far far from the sea. It is possible that the Lord's brain was ravaged by the fumes released when he sank a shaft into the mud at throng, and he knew not what he did. We have clues that he performed some other things Curious deeds in Thrall and BOCES and further afield. Incidentally, given the foul and barely habitable nature of present day boatus the Institute of insect history hovers above it in an airship tethered to a sturdy wooden post. Should you wish to make the trip from thrombosis? Bear in mind that the recommended route is one of much squelching and watertight boots or advisable. One ex mayor of thrum did the journey in his socks for a wager and they found him in a ditch in the squelchy wasteland between town, shivering and gibbering and beset by flies and gnats and bugs and beetles and other escapees from the Lord's enormous squirming sack.

It was an exciting moment when Dennis beer pint publishes a new Opus, the poet of the beatnik and the tweet has a new book out next week. And what a very fat book it is. Those of you expecting a magisterial collection of epic beer, pine tea and versifying are likely to be disappointed. However, there is but a single poem nestled within it 600 pages and it's a very short poem, one might even call it no MC. The rest of the book is given over to what beer pints long suffering publishers dub hefty operators. This sounds like something you might find in a well appointed gymnasium, but is in fact a collection of what we literary types prefer to call weird hot headed ravings from Dennis bear point. There is an introductory essay of over 200 pages, which is neither introductory of anything nor really an essay as such. If one were to be kind, one might say it was an example of surrealist automatic writing. On the other hand, if we're if one were to be unkind, but honest, one would say it resembles the disjointed dribbling of an untethered brain gone to seed. This Farago of nonsense is accompanied by so many footnotes that Taken together, they're longer than the essay itself. If we're to believe the preface 49 pages in total, the footnotes were penned not by the poet, but by his all too real doppelganger, a sort of shadow Dennis beer pint who dogs is every step, like the familiar in the story by James Sheridan le fanu. Now listen, I've been following Dennis Pierpont to Korea from it fetal stages, and this is the first I have heard tell of a doppelganger. I'm assuming the poet is not referring to one of those fanatical acolytes who expressed their devotion by dressing like him, adopting the same hairstyles, eating and drinking an identical diet and languishing upon municipal park benches, clutching one of his flimsy poetry pamphlets to their bosoms, pretending to be morbidly ill. It pains me to say it, but I used to be one of their number. My bench was situated near the duck pond in the park, and I find tuberculosis. The point is that we were akin to the bodyguards employed by the film director George Lucas, who all look alarmingly like him, but we never pretended to be him, and we would certainly never have threatened be upon to mortal and poetic soul. Yet, these are the charges laid at the doppelgangers door in the preface, and indeed, by its own admission, in those interminable and frankly, Ill written footnotes. I have actually read the footnotes in my review copy with the aid of the magnifying glass. They're printed in very, very tiny type in a font called Uber ornate near illegible High German blanket Gothic. I have needed daily eyedrops ever since and spend much of my time lying down in a darkened room. All I'm willing to say is that the footnotes far from casting any light on the imbecilic ravings of beer pint si as themselves bereft of any sense whatsoever. It's like reading the pros of the more impenetrable ganache post modernist while being repeatedly beaten about the IRS with a farmer shovel and an experienced by the way, I have undergone More than one occasion, after accepting an offer to write a critique of lack CAD or the reader or one of those old frauds for the weekly magazine, farmers with shovels consider the left bank intellectual ferment. Despite my suffering, I recommend this publication as sort of Reader's Digest for the shoveling farmer's community, and one which contained in each issue, a goodly number of illustrations, by the noted hyper realist line Oh cutter, Rex hyper. But we're getting

away from beer pint, which will never do. In addition to the preface and the introductory essay, with its voluminous footnote, there's a lengthy section entitled mental pudding. I have read this half a dozen times and still have no idea what it's meant to be about, or what connection it has to the poem. Then there is a bibliography supposedly of books consulted by the poet during the writing of his new work. This actually has some interest, giving us a valuable insight into beer pints preoccupations, and influences. He has read widely, if haphazardly in almost as many languages as Antony Burgess could babbling. No doubt the preposterous Mancunian polymath, will be rolling in his grave that not a single one of his works, appears in this bibliography. But Ayn Rand is there why I like stamp collecting and pebble head and Robert Ludlum and Dick Van Dyke, faith, hope and hilarity a child's eyes view of religion. Beer pint seems also to know his onions when it comes to books about onions, bird seed, the box are rising lobsters, futurist Boy Scouts, dirigibles and hot air balloons, fish and trails, Ruby and Oswald, the Scharnhorst inexplicable flapping noises the life and death of Karen Carpenter, Bob slay flumes pigeons, gutta percha tectonic plate, anteaters, William Betty, the young rosiest tarpaulin, the SIMS II and Hollow Earth Theory, gloves, infections of the pituitary gland birds custard, but oddly no other custard green fly hobnailed spiders, vinegar kampot patterns soap, the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, various paps and slops and rules Gaslight heist, HL Mencken fruit pips, sledgehammer wit, the cottingley fairies, other fairies, non fairy life forms Geoff Hurst, bell shadows, feast, oil rigs, shrubbery, ness, herons, space travel, crests, Dorothy's car jacking toilet tissue bales of hay bales of straw bales, bales Baxters invigorating fluid and other bales it's important to acknowledge the breadth of knowledge be apparent is bringing to the table as it were, when one reads the poem. In the past, he's been accused, not least by me, of treating his readers with contempt, and knocking out verses willy nilly without care or thought, or even a proper pencil. I was particularly harsh in my review of his collection, the assassination of Andrew motion, which I described the vindictive, contemptuous and written without care or thought, or even a proper pencil. Beer pint hasn't spoken to me since. But I retain my superbly aloof critical detachment, and can therefore, with a foppish wave of my hand, announced with jus objectivity, that in spite of the ridiculous operators with which this new book is padded out, the poem itself is a masterpiece. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that it guarantees his place in the Pantheon for all time. I'm so damned impressed with it, that I'm gonna thumb my nose at the copyright laws and read it out on the air now, that will save you from having to buy the book. And if as a result, beer pint or his publishers get upset, then I'm perfectly willing to meet them in a field dorm with pistols. So here it is, then the new poem from Dennis beer pint in its entirety. Where Oh, where is the troglodyte Voltaire.

More than books, longer books than that one published in 1950 to the borrower's by Mary Norton was a children's book about a race of tiny people who live undetected among normal human beings. They're known as borrowers because they survive in part by taking or borrowing everyday objects from the human world and adapting them for their own use. The novel was critically acclaimed, and was followed by a series of sequels over the next 30 years. Its success, however, completely overshadowed a similar series of books written during the same period by flossy bent. The first of these also appearing in 1952 introduced us to the snugglers. The snugglers tells the story of a race of more or less human sized beings who live for the most part, undetected among normal people. They're known as snugglers because they go around snuggling without handkerchiefs. Sometimes they even whimper. They snuggle in a quite unselfconscious and morbidly annoying manner, day in, day out in all sorts of circumstances. Much of the fun of the books Well, not fun Exactly. Let's instead call it mild diversion, is that the normal humans, excuse me is that the normal humans seldom recognize the snugglers for what they are a parallel race of super snuggly handkerchief as beings consumed with self pity. The first book introduces us to a little family of snugglers the couple paub and who Bertie and their spirited teenager daughter, Agamemnon it. They snowball through over 400 pages in houses and barns and bungalows and sheds and shacks and chalets, upon pavements and thoroughfares on the see battered strand, and in fields and hills and frozen steps on weekdays and public holidays. In the cold and the rain or on hot, cloudless summer days. sniffle sniffle sniffle they go with a whimper here and there to vary the tone. undeterred by her debut, being comprehensively outsold by the borrower's philosophy bent followed up with a sequel in 1955. Alas, the snugglers in a sump was published in the very same week as Mary Norton's own second book, The borrow was a field, though once again overlooked by all but a few. It marks a huge development. For now the snugglers are joined by a gaggle of anthropomorphic animals, akin to those in the tails written by Beatrix Potter. We meet Jeffrey the Beaver, Bob the snail, Cynthia the horse and dagobert the puff adder as this jolly quartet scary and slither and canter and creep through the book, The snugglers sniffle sometimes rather noisily it's a tour de force. Several other snugglers books followed, barely selling enough to break even and actually aged Flossie bent became rancorous and sour and difficult. She eventually died in a crapped out boarding house at a ruined seaside resort. snuggling like one of her timeless characters without even a handkerchief to her name.

My mantelpiece where I keep my buttons, but where am I to put my unbuttons a bright six year old would put their hand up and cry in your unvalued But there's no such thing as an advance neither of 10 nor have Antin. Or if there is such a thing as an advance that which of ours is not, it would not be possible to put anything into it. Because it's the ability to hold things, buttons, and buttons, flowers, coinage, Treasury tags, that in part at least defines of ours. I'm particularly keen on tin vases because they're cheap and light and battery trouble. Bash, one with your fist while cursing the universe, and it will not smash into smithereens, it will merely receive a dent or two. As we say in my little group Haskell such dense can lend a tin vase character. Heaven knows what would happen if you bashed a tin anvils or even an untain on vase. That is assuming you could do so in the first place, which is by no means guaranteed. I suppose if you saved it so that you and the underbars were reflected in a judiciously placed mirror at the time of the bashing that might work. I might share that thought with the group has to kill when next we meet. Usually, we gathered a hot but we're keen to push envelopes. So we plan to hold our next meeting in an unhappy as yet we failed to locate one that bright six year old might say, well, a shed is a non hot being a shed instead of a hot, but that's not strictly true. A shared is sufficiently similar to a heart to be mistaken for one by most people on most days, in most circumstances. What a pallava. Another advantage of the tin vase is that when struck with say a pebble, it makes a tinny clang. There are antennae clangs and we can easily imagine an unclean, tinny or otherwise, for an unclean would be any noise that isn't not a clang. Or actually it might be silence, dead silence as one will find in the grave. When one is consigned there. Eventually, six feet under, pushing up the daisies. I have things so arranged that when my time comes, I'm hoping to push up and daisies I've circulated instructions to the members of the group Haskell in case they survive me if they might, some of them are young and hail. I can't I condescend to them. It's true, but they take it in good part. Perhaps they can see the shadow looming over my shoulder. The Grizzly worm eaten shadow that is a sort of an guardian angel or guardian an angel. isn't an angel or devil or is it something more horrifying? I have wondered from time to time in the bath or upon a balcony if an angel is the kind of being so unnaturally gruesome that when one tries to speak of it, one's tongue cleaves to the roof of one's mouth, and one can only make incoherent muffled noises like a small animal trapped in the sight of a larger one, and about to be torn to pieces with great savagery in bright battering sunlight. One of the reasons I keep my buttons in attend bars upon the mantle piece is to give my brain a distraction from these dark and debilitating thoughts. As soon as I sent my mind rolling along the cold iron rails towards bleakness and death and the triumph of an an angel over my soul, stamping it under foot, I hide on my mantelpiece and take my tin vase, and I spill the buttons out of it onto a platter and I count them or I polish them, rubbing them with a rag steeped in bleach or small finger, or I examine them closely through an optical aid, one by one holding each button between my forefinger and thumb in my left hand, squinting, piercing until I'm no longer conscious of the sounds in the garden, the awful sounds of large beasts, slaughtering small ones, and the sounds of the grave digger in his filthy overalls, forcing his spade into the muck again and again and tossing each spadeful onto a heap so slowly, relentlessly while he whistles at Troon, both sweet and unnerving, a tune I've heard somewhere before long ago, in my youth, when I played with Billy and perkin, and the idiot child in fields and hills all summer long. And when my whole head is numb, it's in. It's like Sue it.

I tip my buttons back into the 10 bars and replace it on the mantle piece. And I gathered the group past school, and I addressed them in a voice dripping with contempt or in a roar until like, clap. They clap. They clap. Like keep on clapping as if I was started. But I am uninstalling. Remember my name, engrave it on a piece of Patty and carry it with you wherever you roam.

Finally, finally, finally this week the pudding question. Whenever I come upon the phrase over egging the pudding, I want to know precisely what sort of pudding is being talked about, with a recipe where possible. I have been known to ask the question aloud, so keen Am I to know if I'm out and about on a bus, for example, or sitting on a municipal park bench? My Southern crier? Yes, yes, but what kind of pudding can disconcert those who overhear me? I have never in the circumstances received a satisfactory reply to my question, but that's hardly surprising. People just don't seem to know as much about puddings as they used to. I'm not sure why that is. It could be part of the same regrettable civilizational decline, which has seen Received Pronunciation disappear from our radio broadcasts and television programs. You can bet that a 1930s bus passenger or a 1950s Municipal park bench occupant would have turned to face me and said eggy pudding I expect old chap. Clearly enunciating every last syllable. I'll give eggy pudding merely as an example. Remember that the presence of eggs? Even too many eggs in a pudding does not necessarily indicate that the pudding itself is an eggy one. It might be a plum pudding, a suit pudding, or my lady Kent pudding, to name but a lovely trio of puddings. There are others. What bothers me what has me shouting my head off on a bus or a bench or elsewhere? Is the laziness of writers who trot out the phrase over egging the pudding. Without thinking. I would not for a moment dare compare myself with George Orwell. But he and I have one thing in common, which is that we like to keep count of our eggs. Indeed, I would go further than the author of shooting an elephant. I like to keep count not only of my own eggs, but other people's eggs, and of fictional eggs, and metaphorical eggs. I am Alfred Hitchcock's worst nightmare. The point is, if I'm told that a pudding has been over egged, I want to know by how many eggs the recipe has been exceeded and to know that I need to know the identity of the pudding. Is that a crime? In this day and age it probably is. After all, there are council officials who think egg might mean for example in Latin, they might well turfed me out of my bus seat or bench and take me away to a compulsory brain sloughing workshop, where I will learn that the counting of eggs is pernicious and the identification of puddings is anti social. Until that day, I shall continue to demand an answer to my question, because I want to know about the eggs and the puddings. And I make no excuses for being a seeker after knowledge and enlightenment. And that's the end of this week's show. And I'll be back next week with possibly more about eggs. Bye bye
