Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting out on the air. Unfortunately, I'm not in a supermarket. I thought John's show coming from Sainsbury's somewhere was absolutely fabulous. And I think I should do this. I think I need to record one of my shows in a supermarket. My they'll do that next week. Um, where were we? Yeah, well, soup in the beard, was a condition which affected many Victorian gentlemen possessive disgusting table manners. It commonly took the form of patches of beard hair becoming soaked in spilled soup, which then dried out, causing the hairs to become matted and malodorous. The Spirit would usually occur at the point where the Victorian gentleman wielding a spoonful of soup and aiming to transfer the full amount into his mouth would fall at the last hurdle, and send some or all of the spoonful dribbling down his beard. If the bowl of soup was a generous one, as it often was at Victorian banquets, repetitions of this maneuver could result in the beard being absolutely drenched with droplets of the spelled soup, dripping onto the elegantly embroidered tablecloth. Although we do not have precise figures, it's believed that a significant proportion of cases of soup in the beard were caused by uncontrollable tremors of the hand, symptoms of withdrawal from the gargantuan doses of opium favored by almost all Victorian gentlemen. This does not of course, excuse their disgusting table manners, which were disgusting, almost as disgusting as at another time in another place. The table manners of Franz Kafka. Contemporary written accounts of soup in the beard are surprisingly few, possibly because it was so prevalent, so much or commonplace that chroniclers of the time did not consider it worthy of remark. A vivid exception is contained in a letter written by the Tao Dowager Duchess Dipsy of pox Haven, dated 14th of January 1868. And I quote, last night, I attended a dinner to raise funds for the Society for the Promotion of sending working class orphans down mineshaft held it such blackened house. I was seated next to Walter mad, whose beard is prodigious. The poor man's hands were shaking badly, and he confessed to me that he had not had a dose of opium for a full half hour during the soup course mulligatawny to my horror, while so mad had a great deal of difficulty transferring the soup from bowl to mouth by means of a spoon, and after a minute or two, his beard was sopping wet, almost more soup than hair. I was amused to note that he summoned his valet, who proceeded to wring out the beard, much like a janitor with a mop. cleverly, Walter mad commanded him to do this directly over the bowl, so that the soup in the beard replenish the soup in the bowl. By this means, and by several further ringing out, Walter mad was still busy with his soup, while the rest of us had moved on to the jagged hair and the strangled weasel. His table manners are disgusting, but he gave 10 shillings to send urgence from the lower orders down the minds. So his cold black heart is in the right place. Next week, egg on the waistcoat

The paradox of Calvin's pebble is a famous or infamous conundrum. It was first posed not by Tarleton himself, but by his Valley, the dwarf Pasco. Legend has it that Keira Pascoe crept into the room where Tarleton was hosting a squishy and sophisticated cocktail party, attended by various mountain is polar explorers, flappers, Jesuit, Toad headed robbers, Quakers, conjurers, reprobate gas meter readers, spud face nippers fanatics, greaseproof, paper salesman, composer's dentist tapani heighten the tosspot grown GUI neuro performers, Chappaquiddick experts, football refs, tugboat captains, hedges and ditches. gondoliers minstrels, troubadours astronaut emboldened milk toast, rhubarb, barians, eel men, dabblers plotters, coppers, Tanner's Cooper's Fletcher's tailors, tinker's, opera Dan's, floozies, weathermen, mavens, bus conductors, out of town, pointy towners, painters, pimps and Potter's Yes, Potter's several Potter's indeed more Potter's than you could shake a stick at. Were you minded so to do not for the first time, Tarleton had got the precise balance of his swish sophisticated cocktail party guest list. A little askew things were nevertheless going with a swing in spite of the potter imbalance when in crept crab Pascoe, he silenced the hubbub in his usual manner. By holding aloft the gold painted head of an antique Italian ate the monkey doll through Richie ventriloquist. Then, in his horrible voice, raucous as a crow, he posed the conundrum, which became known as the paradox of Talton pebble. The effect was instantaneous. The puzzle does eat the brains of all those present, including Talton himself. It did pick their brains, and it also dizzy their bodies so that the room became a scene of chaos. The guest reeling about staggering, flailing, vomiting and groaning well satisfied crew, Pascoe crept out and returned to his pantry. He replaced the head of the monkey doll on it shrine, fixed himself a snack and sat in his rocking chair, rocking, creaking back and forth through the long winter evening, on the night before the Munich air disaster.

Once upon a time, there was a little Italian boy made out of wood, he wore a pointy hat also wooden. In this age of grand illusion, he walked into my life out of my dreams, and forced his way into my scheme of things. This was somewhat unnerving. For us, it's not an everyday occurrence to find oneself in Thrall to a wooden boy, but in Thrall die was to the point where the tables were turned, and I tried to fit in with his scheme of things. In order to do so, I felt I needed to gain a better understanding of what it was like to be made of wood. So I drove to the forest in a Japanese car. I parked at the edge by a pond, and then I walked deep into the forest and stood there pretending to be a tree, a pine or an Elm. First I was fidgety. But as the hours passed, I found it easier to stand perfectly still, as if I wouldn't. I swayed slightly in the breeze. The little Italian boy made of wood had not followed me to the forest for he could not drive. I wondered what he was up to back in my chalet perched on the edge of a glassier it was a wooden chalet, so it suited him well. Better. In fact, then it suited me. I felt so at home in the forest. Why so wanted to sprout leaves and buds. Several months passed before I was forced to admit that I could not fit into his scheme of things, and that I was not nor ever would be made out of wood. I trudged back through the forest towards the pond, where I park the Japanese car. It had been stolen. I sat on a tuffet next to the pond, and I've pondered, pondering by a pond, not made of wood. The sky was immense and immensely blue. It was a small mercy that I did not know that little wooden Italian boy was a delinquent rascal, and had burned down my chalet. The instant I screeched away in my Japanese car. And yet, the world keeps turning. That, after all, is in the scheme of things, whether one is wooden, or let's just be plain, not wooden, not wooden at all. Neither pine nor Elm, nor any of the other types of wood, they all burn.

saw this week, he seemed to be getting just almost uninterrupted bits of prose with no comment in between makes a bit of a change from last week, the three hour special of Paula opera, our hooting yard plug or whatever it was called. And it went on for three hours that show and I hope it raised vast amounts of money. But of course, it's not too late to go to the resonance FM website and donate even more money if you've got any left. And if you've got some money left and you've donated almost everything to resonance, then you can always donate some directly to me hooting yard. Otherwise helps go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org and you'll find a little PayPal button you'll find lots of books to buy. And you'll also find this flipping heck is a small village equidistant between pointy town and its Twin Town, pointy Twin Town. pointy town his point here oh so much point here than pointy Twin Town, which is itself point here than most comparable towns, and certainly oodles more pointy than flipping Heck, which is not pointing at all. The pointedness of pointing town until the latter yet significant extent of pointy Twin Town, or topics often remarked upon in the tavern at flipping heck. In fact, the flipping heck Tavern is rarely talk of anything else, unless it be their gutters and drains and sewers and subterranean catacombs and ossuaries and tunnels. When that is they talk about nothing at all. For much of the time in the tavern. They do not speak but cup their tankard in their big hairy religious hands, gazing morosely into the fog. Within the tavern, the fog is thick, but it's even thicker outside. It's very difficult to see where you're going and flipping Heck, quite apart from the thick fog. There are no signposts nor do the lanes have names, and nor do the hovels have numbers. There is a postman, but his comings and goings are shrouded in mystery, and nobody will swear on a Bible that they've ever seen him. There is one Bible in flipping heck and it is kept To a lectern in the village church, St. Bibi Bibi did. The Vicar is from overseas, far, far away overseas and speaks in his own strange guttural tongue, or rather shouts Oh, how he shouts. His Sunday morning sermons can be heard from miles around it, he said you can just about hear them from the western outskirts of pointy town, and from the eastern outskirts of pointy Twin Town. If the air is still and you prick up your ears. The ad is rarely still, for tremendous and terrifying wins how across the flat expanse of marshland between pointy town and flipping Heck, and between flipping heck and pointy Twin Town. It is the sort of marshland in which your fertile imagination will summon into being sprites and ghouls and occasionally escaped convict. It is said that the lumbering walrus mustache psychopath babinski lurks somewhere in the marshes, sharpening his axe and hi biding his time, until one night he will lumber into flipping Heck, and slaughter the firstborn. It is the thought of such a calamity that hangs in the air unspoken in the village tavern, along with the fog. The now dead Vicar who preceded the present incumbent of St. Beverly babe did letter campaign to make flipping heck more pointy, if not quite as pointy as pointy Twin Town, and certainly far less pointy than pointy town, but pointing Nevertheless, there is very little evidence of his efforts, save for his tombstone incident biblically bib Dibs churchyard, which is a little bit pointy when viewed from a certain angle in a certain light during certain phases of the moon.

The moon is a silver disc in the sky, such as the fog and flipping Heck, it is barely visible to the villagers, merely a blur of milky light, far far above their heads, but they rarely look up their thoughts such as they are directed down to their gutters and drains and sewers, and subterranean catacombs, and ossuaries and tunnels. Once it was possible to reach both pointy town and pointy Twin Town through the tunnels, but for more than a century now, they have been blocked off. Rumor has it that when he is not working in the marshes babinski prowls the tunnels, dragging his blood cringe backs behind him singing his horrible song.

When I do live readings, in other words, appearing before a paying audience or even a non paying audience doesn't happen very often, although it is happening in a couple of weeks time on the ninth of March at the Brewer's arms in shacklewell. Lane. I should really ought to have better detail here. There is actually details on the hooting yard website so you can go to that. It's in Dalston. It's on March the ninth, and I'll be appearing as a guest of Richard Thomas and Jonathan Bowman, who are doing a monthly series called in variety. Yeah, I think it's the Brewers arms is definitely on track or shacklewell lane or shacklewell. Something. It's definitely in Dalston. March the ninth further details next week, because it's not for two weeks. Anyway, what I was trying to say was I don't often do live gigs, but when I do, one of the things that seems to go down quite well is a piece I wrote called bind the 49 symphonies. I'm not going to read that to you. Instead, I'm going to read you symbol of peace corps binder, the 39 piano concertos. binders first Piano Concerto had no piano part and was not a concerto. There was a piano in the second Piano Concerto, but it was out of tune. The third Piano Concerto was definitely the fourth gave binder the heebie jeebies, binders fifth or the sixth, as it's usually called, excuse me, binders fifth, or the sixth as it is usually called, was performed in a submarine. Let us draw a veil over the sixth, by which I mean the sixth proper, rather than the fifth with which it is often confused, performed as it is in a submarine. The seventh is that rare thing a god awful din binders, eighth, ninth and 10th piano concertos are audible only to dogs, the 11th features and electronically modified cat. No animals were harmed in the composition of the 12th. But the score for the 13th Piano Concerto calls for the ritual slaughter of several otters. The 14th is pithy. The 15th is punchy, the 16th was dedicated to Starling. The 17th there's a carbon copy of the ninth Piano Concerto number 18 is so vivid, it makes grown men weep and grown women have an attack of the Vipers. The 19th Piano Concerto has the charm of a sausage, the seventh, the 20th the brilliant 20th is rudderless. rudderless. rodders snapped off boats are repeatedly and relentlessly bashed on the keyboard during the 21st. The 22nd is popular in prisons, the 23rd is full of grace. The 24th was used in a toothpaste advertisement. The 25th was written a top and important station remounting. The 26th is fishy binders 27th is the longest Piano Concerto a full performance lasting several years. The 28th consists of a single note of the performers choosing clinked twice and plunked once the 29th is the last The 30th is hidden. The 31st tugs at the heartstrings. The manuscript of the 32nd rolled up and stuffed into a jam jar and there is still jam in the jar. The 33rd is all that the 32nd is not the 34th, gallops along like a horse. The 35th slivers like a worm binder said of the 36th Piano Concerto de gustibus non si dispute tandem. raindrops kept falling on binders head while he was writing the 37th. The 38th is a biography of Christopher Plummer imagined as a Piano Concerto for 39th. Stairs its way through choppy waters towards an island where brutes Dysport themselves in wild abandon before sinking into the sea.

Oh, hang on, I can give you full details of the the event. It's on. It's it's in variety. Frank key Jonathan Bowman and Richard Thomas. It's eight o'clock. It costs five pounds. And there's a strictly limited capacity. I'm not sure what that is. is a brewers bar. 77 shacklewell line, Dalston, London, ie, eight to be on Wednesday, the ninth of March. So Be there or be square, as they say. Now, I'm not sure this is gonna work. But I'd like to play the song. I'm actually gonna, it's not. I don't know. We'll see if it'll work. it'll it'll work. So, I'll play the song. And then I'll tell you About the song. So hold on.

Frank Key  25:21
While we're waiting for it to happen, he says please wait. I'll tell you what I'm going to give up and try it a different way.

Frank Key  25:38
Bear with us. Doesn't seem to want to happen.

Frank Key  25:56
Not this isn't working, is it? I'm gonna have one more one more tribe before I give up entirely.

Frank Key  26:12
I'll go. No, it's not happening. what it was, is a shame you didn't get to hear it might actually I'm not going to tell you what it was because I think I'll work out a method of playing a different week. And then you'll get overexcited. How wonderful is just to reassure you, any of you that are worried? Don't worry, it's not me singing. How long have we got? We haven't really got any time left. We might have time for me to read. One. extract from I haven't read from this for quite a while. It's Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives. The book you should all have available in all good book shops. And right, let's see. Let's see who should we have. So Robin Lee Pemberton, who was the governor of the Bank of England during the 1980s. And this is what it says in my book. When he was governor of the Bank of England in the 1980s, Robin Lee Pemberton installed beehives on the roof of the Bank of England. One day when he was abroad, he received a frantic telephone call from a bank official telling him that the bees had swarmed into the offices below, and were causing chaos. asked for his advice, Lee Pemberton said, put them in a box and slammed down the phone. So that's what you do. If you've got a swarm of bees, you just put them in a box. It's as simple as that. I think you know, this. Robin Lee Pemberton is immediately followed in my book by john lennon and I can't really resist breathing. reading this the brief life of john lennon, English Beagle and husband Yoko Ono. 1942 1980. According to burn 11 there is nothing wrong with john lennon that could not be cured by standing him upside down and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls out. And with that thought, that's the end of the show for this week. Very many thanks to Charlotte for stepping in to do the second recording while john was off in a supermarket for some reason. Okay, bye bye.
