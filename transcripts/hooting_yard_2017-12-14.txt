This is resonance why 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. Or dab? Something. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. We're we're approaching the end of the year. And sometime in the new year we'll be approaching the end of the 13th year of hooting out on the air. And just quite a thought, I'd like to begin this week with a song and it's called the cuthberts sprang song. It's quite clueless. And well, we'll get there. I need to put my specs on Hang on. So, this is the cuff but sprang song. A one, two a 1234 casket sprang calf spraying sprang. He's the boss of the mayonnaise gang. He takes time color rights issues. He talks between males and pays and you came unglued on some Bumblebee big day. A car pulled up to take him away. He thought them off with pins and straw. Yes, pins and straw and nothing more. They say he's related to no BS styles, according to police station files, but he denies any links by blood to not be named memorably smeared with mud. At the end of that match in 66 cathode Spang loads Weetabix and coco pops and Special K he issues breakfast every day. But who's they still go with? Bang for he's a boss of the mayonnaise gang cough Bert Spang cough but sprang cough Bert sprang

I was joined I was joined for that sing song if that's a word that could be used for it by pansy cradle Drew, who sounds remarkably like Miss blossom Partridge who's been here in previous weeks with her knitting tips. If that pansy sitting next to me knitting, which is even more eerie. Let's see if we can hear any of the knitting. No, we can't. We can't hear anything. And I was gonna say what was I gonna say? I think we decided when we'd finished doing that, that we would have made a better Fist of singing alabaster crayon, which is our new favorite song. So maybe, maybe we can maybe we'll do that in a future show. In one of those beautiful duets that I'm sure you enjoyed. Anyway, we all know that God spelled backwards his dog. But it's not commonly pointed out that Ergo spelled backwards is Olga. This can lead us to I can't really see this is the problem. My eyesight has now got so bad that I have this kind of drug ganttic type on I'm reading from and I still can't see it properly. So I'm going to start again and meanwhile you can all feel pity for me for my bad eyesight and possibly even send me money to pay for bionic eyes. I don't know. Anyway, let's begin again. We all know that God's spelled backwards his dog, but it's not commonly pointed out that Ergo spelled backwards is Olga. This insight can lead us to faff about with Descartes famous dictum kognito ergo sum. So that instead of stating, I think therefore I am we say instead I think I am an ogre. It could be argued that this is actually a more profound statement than de cartes original. It could be and it has. In a new book the paperback is pebble head takes Cogito ergo sum up sorry takes Cogito ergo sum as his starting point, and weaves a tale staggering and its implications. I am known for my potboilers said pebble head speaking from his chalet, oh pros high in the Swiss Alps, smoking his pipe, fat paperbacks with garish covers sold in bulk airport bookstores and the like. With my new book, I'd like to think I've created an entirely new genre, which I have dubbed the pot boiler of profundity. This is a fat paperback with a garish cover sold in bulk airport bookstores, and the like. Which, in terms of deep mind numbing profundity, can stand alongside the deepest and most mind numbing and most profound works in the canon. bashed out in just two weeks of frantic typing, pebble heads potboiler of profundity tells the story of a man who thinks he is an ogre. it poses questions which delve into the core of the human soul. If I think I'm an ogre, am I an ogre? If I think I'm an ogre, but I'm not an ogre, what Then am I? Why would I think I'm an ogre in the first place? Am I hairy and brutish and savage? Do I grunt rather than speak articulate words? If so, how do I manage to narrate this potboiler of profundity in such punchy prose data to answer me that or I'll tear your head off with my bare hands or rather pause Yes, great, hairy pause suitable for an ogre. And when I turn your head off, I'll carry it back to my lair, a dark dank cave full of bat where I look grunting on slobbering Oh, garishly.

With your head torn off and tossed onto the pile of other torn off human heads in the corner of my cave. You won't be able to continue reading my fat paperback with a garish cover sold in bulk airport bookstores and the like Will you you won't be able to read and you won't be able to think. And if you can't read and you can't think Can you call yourself civilized? Or are you to now merely an ogre? Or be one without a head? Ultimately, are we not all of us wandering the world like headless ogres searching for are torn off heads tossed onto piles of other tone of heads in the corners of dark, dank caves is one of those caves Plato's cave with Plato to an ogre. And if Plato was an ogre, what have Rene Descartes and what have you. The latest news from pebble head is that his own brain has been so been designed by the writing of his potboiler of profundity that he's currently languishing exhausted on the balcony of a sanatorium even higher in the Swiss Alps than his chalet, oh pros. His book is available at all good airport bookstores. We wish him well.

Sorry, we do music master a bit longer than normal because I was showing john a piece of art that I made called Talmudic scholar with two pointy things. If you'd like to see that and appreciate it artistically, perhaps write a critique or interrogate it. You can a discourse in which you can interrogate the artwork. You can find it on the hooting yard website. Talmudic scholar with two pointy things is called. And it's always worth going to the hooting God website in anything case are might tell you a bit more about that later in the show. I'll tell you now, it's three. I've recently had some little updates to the, to the design of the site. So that some of the things in the in the links on the sidebar that were redundant or dead are now removed. And there's new things like, like the fact that some of the really old hooting out on the air shows from way back 13 years ago. There's currently a project underway to transfer all of those old codes on the YouTube. And so far, I think there are six episodes available. Just go to well, you can find a link to the YouTube, the YouTube hooting yard, cash or whatever it's called. Bag alano are on the hooting yard website. And of course, there's also lots of other things to do there like buy books and so on. Remember that when you buy books, I get a little bit of money for each book and that will help me to get my bionic eyes or strongest specs. This is called Dobson on an atoll. Dobson once found himself marooned on a remote at all the circumstances were inexplicable. He had a vague memory of toppling from the deck of a Barkan time, but could not recall what he was doing aboard the boat in the first place. Nor did he remember how he came to be washed up on a barren sea girt rock, but there he was, and he had to lump it. As I'm mostly desk bound pamphleteer, Dobson had never found cause to undergo rigorous training in basic survival skills. So the first few minutes on the at all were emotionally wrenching, to say the least. In fact, Dobson could not recall such an emotionally wrenching experience, since he had attended a performance of binders third Symphony. The conductor on that occasion was the psychotic Maestro Lothar preen and his approach to that Piccolo and glockenspiel business in the final movement course in Dobson the welling up of the most wrenching, emotional experience he had ever had. He remembered the music as he sat slumped on the atoll staring at the sea. Though the sound in his head was of an LP recording, conducted by binder himself with a piccolos and glockenspiel was slightly less emotionally wrenching than in preens hand. Dobson was not overly fond of what he considered binders, somewhat clinical treatment of his own Symphony. He once wrote an intemperate letter to the composer, insisting that he re record all the LPS of his music with more, but tore it up before sending it not from second thoughts, but because he did not have binders postal address, and did not at the time have the energy or wherewithal to punt it down. Energy and were with all However, what precisely what he needed to call upon if he were to survive his marooned on a remote at all. And to his credit, Dobson did not shilly shally first thought his first thought was a food and then a shot of his first thought was a food and then of water and then of shelter. It was almost as if he had undergone rigorous training in basic survival skills. He wondered briefly, briefly if he had attended a course of instruction in a dream. Dobson often had vivid dreams and wrote down the details upon waking, he fossick in the pockets of his overcoat for his notebook, thinking that perhaps he might find a list of hints and tips on basic survival skills, scribbled down one dorm before the dream faded.

As he rummaged his fingers fell upon something unfamiliar. And taking it from his pocket. He found he was clutching a packet of frozen crinkle cut oven chips. The food problem then was solved at least for the time being, or so Dobson thought he could either suck the chips as he would ice lollies or he could lay them out on the atoll and let them fall in the sunlight. stupidly, he decided on the latter. No sooner had he torn open the packet and laid the frozen chips out in neat rows upon the barren rock than a formidable flock of stairs. seagulls came swooping out of the sky and snatched every single clip up in their terrible beaks, vast dogs and experienced a third wrenching of the emotions, perhaps the most emotionally wrenching to date. Such was intensity, that Dobson leapt his feet and shook his fist at the sky and screamed his head off at the seagulls. But the seagulls had already flown far far away, perhaps to another at all, where they would put your while and scuff their crinkle cut oven trips, seagulls will eat anything. A little sprite within Dobson's head told him that he was wasting his energy. So he sat down and gazed about him. This was when he noticed that there were various creatures such as barnacles and limpets and muscles clinging to the rock. They were not frozen and did not need thawing. He wrote the word food in his notebook and placed a tick next to it. Thompson had read a number of books about at all Maroon mint. And it was the memory of these he now grew upon, he could collect rainwater in his upturned hat, for example, it was not raining, but Dobson was wearing a yachting cap. So he took this off and placed it upside down on a level of patch of rock as he could find. As he did so he felt a pang of great perplexity, for he could not remember ever seeing that yachting cat before. How did it come to be wearing it? It must be connected in some way to the bark and time from which we had a vague recollection of having toppled into the sea. It was not the sort of headgear he would normally choose to wear. He was a humbug man through and through, except for those occasions when he sported a floppy and shapeless thingy, or battered, rouladen crown. But stylish or not. The yachting cap would catch rainwater if and when rain fell. Dobson looked up at the sky and saw a cloud. It was quite white and very high above him. He totally bloomed for minutes, and then he looked up again vanished on the air. He took his notebook, wrote the word water and placed a question mark next to it. The master item on his agenda was shelter. It was a particularly wrenching emotional moment, when he admitted to himself that there was no sign either of foliage or of a tatty tarpaulin, abandoned by a previous Mulrooney. Dobson was at the mercy of the elements. He thought of that passage in binders 10th Symphony when the four elements are evoked by more than bassoon toots, and he began to weep. Then he remembered something else he had read in one of those books, that always sooner or later, a ship full of Jesuits would appear. And one need only dance and hop like a mad thing, waving one's arms, and they would sail into the rescue. Or perhaps it was the Jesuit who was marooned, and the ship's crew were just ordinary sailors. Whichever way round it was the dancing and hopping and waving was the important thing. And so he practiced those disciplines with great vim and vigor while munching thirstily on barnacles. Until a ship Hove interview on the horizon. It was the itms Gerard Manley Hopkins, and it took him home that's lost.

And let us never forget the time Dobson got into a pickle. Hold your horses you say? Dobson got into multiple pickles over the years. which particular pickle is it I'm enjoying never to forget. To which I would reply that I do not have any horses Kitto cannot hold horses as you would have me do. After scratching your head for a moment you suggest I go lolloping off across several fields to some kind of farmstead where I might encounter a flock of horses, some of which I could then corral together with a cowboy style suit, and that's hold them in place as you bid me do. I want of horses I asked in a tone which in part both amusement incredulity, a flock. You are modeling horses with birds to creatures which could not be more different. flock huddle gang murmuration you snap back. What does it matter? Too much is made of those bestie or collective nouns. They are linguistic fripperies and I Abdul fripperies of all kinds as is my want this point, enter Robert Fripp for Dorset born guitar placa. He takes umbrage at being in a good he flicks a plectrum at you, which strikes you on the creek causing you to cry out. I stand by saying nothing waiting for this altercation to play itself out for the time being the Dobson pickle is put on the back burner. Are you challenging me to a jewel sir? You few but Robert Fripp listening, likening his flick of the plectrum to the slap across the face of a glove or gauntlet, a common signal of challenge in the golden age of juuling. Long passed. By way of reply, Robert Fripp execute some intricate noodling on his guitar, employing a second plectrum he had tucked into the cuff of his shirt. You hoist a shovel, unnoticed until now, which had been leaning against the trunk of a mighty cedar. shovel held aloft, you run screaming at Robert Fripp in a manner akin to a blood drenched homicidal maniac. The terrified guitar blocker. ceases plucking turns on his heel and scampers away in the direction of Dorset. Now, where were we you ask? Kenya's I am to pursue the topic of Dobson's pickle, and not merely king but avid. I've remained so amused by the flock of horses who are that I cannot let it drop. accordingly. I cubicle and there is mockery in my chortle you mock me though I am armed with a shovel and quite prepared to use it as you have just witnessed you say giving me pause. I have been bashed with a shovel in the past on a number of occasions, and I have no wish to repeat the experience. My knees buckle and I struggled to remain upright. You reach out with your free hand the under shoveled one to help me steady myself. I am moved by this unexpected gesture of Amity and tears well up in my eyes, but I'm easily moved. One of my parents that poetic one observed that I was as easily moved as a mote of dust in an autumnal Gale. When I was old enough to think about this simile, I wondered why my poetic parent employed the image of a mote of dust rather than have a leaf for leaves of what we commonly see being moved and blown by gales in autumn time. This thought occasion in me an inferiority complex, or what would now be called low self esteem. Was I naught but a mote of dust in my parents eyes, or at least in my poetic parents eyes, or rather, I for ma had but one following a cocktail party calamity, or would your cocktail stick became detached from it sausage, and a succeeding series of events rendered her eyeless in one socket. Mas remaining I fortunately, was gimlet and it was said she could spot a mote of dust at 50 paces. This was said in my hearing by her opposition, and it served to assuage my self esteem. So I no longer suffered moping. We'd really in the shadows.

Frank Key  24:10
You invite me to further mock you and I exceed you invite me not to further mock you and I accede readily dabbling my tears with a rag from my pocket. You put down the shovel, leaning it against the trunk of a different tree, a benzi poplar. We have reached an accommodation. You no longer fear my mockery, and I no longer fear being bashed with the shovel. Now God willing, we can embark on an agreeable conversation regarding that pickle Dobson got himself into, which will never be forgotten. But all of a sudden, Robert Fripp reappears he is accompanied by his wife, the diminutive warbler, toyah Wilcox, you and I shift positions almost imperceptible So we are closer together, forming a united front. This is a standoff. Nobody knows how it will end. Then at precisely the same moment, you and toyah Wilcox lunged for the shovel top. Locks tongues in aspic played over the closing credits.

That's nearly the end of this week's show. Unfortunately, it's the last hooting yard on the air of 2017. As I will not be here next week. As I say, there is the the on the hurting odd website there are links to recent shows on the MCs cloud resonance archive. And what will become an ever growing corpus of work on YouTube. So your shooting yard needs will be met for the foreseeable future. If you sat and listened to everything, you probably know an ant could die in that time. The other thing I must mention which I keep forgetting to mention is that there is a new hooting yard book a new hooting yard paperback, but it's been out for a few weeks. And it's a it's a reprint of a piece a piece originally published as a pamphlet in the 1990s. It's called obsequies for last talc struck by lightning. It's it's Yeah, it's it's different to the kind of thing I write nowadays. Although some would argue that it's almost exactly the same. But anyway, yes, that's a new a new hooting yard book. So go to the website, click on the little picture of the cover, you can see there, and you can find out how you can order it online. And if you order it quickly, you get it in time for Christmas. And even though nobody took any notice of John's plea for Christmas cards. I know that I can rely on hooting yard listeners and I know that everyone now listening to this program, all seven of you, or however many there are, will immediately immediately go and buy copies of obsequies for last talc. I will check the sales figures later this evening. And I hope to see them increased by a great magnitude. And yeah, I think that's about it for 2017. I don't think I've got time to read anything else. Unless I read you a very short brief brief life from Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives. So let us I will in fact, because it's so short, I've got time to read this. This is the brief brief life of Benito Mussolini, the Italian statesman 1883 to 1945. Mussolini had a terror of moonlight touching his face when he was asleep. Apparently that's true, as is everything in that book. You can buy that too. There's a link links to all the books. So if you need Christmas gifts for your loved ones, or your hated ones, or all those in between, we will dog and you know where to go. Farewell for this year. And I'll be back in the new year I think Bye bye.
