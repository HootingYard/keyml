Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. It's live live from London and it's very hot so I'm a bit like a a wilting sunflower, or, or perhaps a Holly Hawk battered by the sun. So much so that I haven't prepared properly for this week's show because what I should have been able to do at this point is play you a little bit of music from Vril which is a band now a foursome used to be a trio drillers Chris Cutler Bob Drake lucasta monus and Pierre oma. Chris Cutler, of course, the CO writer of the Caucasian lullaby, which is the adopted seam tune of hooting yard. Anyway, um, the second rail album is out, it's called the fatal duck pond. And as with the previous release by the band, about five or six years ago, they very sensibly asked me to do the sleeve notes and do some drawings and make up the song titles or the track titles, because they're an instrumental band and give the album its name. So I did and I thought as a special treat, oh, before I go on, if you want to buy the album by direct from recommended records or the mega core, you know what it was like if you want to buy the album when you buy the album. And there's a link to it at hooting yard, the website or just go direct to the mega call. Just put that in Google and you'll find it. So go and buy the fatal duck pond by drill and when you buy the CD. These are the sleeve notes. These notes are reproduced with permission from beekeepers right about compact discs magazine, a weekly periodical. As far as I can ascertain, the second album by the band drill has been made without any be involvement whatsoever. These 18 new waxwings by the group now a quartet form the soundtrack to the European arthouse film classic, the fatal duck pond seven hours long, black and white and silent for large stretches apart from these musical numbers and sparse patches of dialogue, mumble in an incoherent and invented language. The film is a visionary reworking of the 1956 Hollywood Western the blood soaked Revenge of Escobar beppo itself an adaptation of a rare and little performed Jacobean drama, whose author was stabbed to death in a brawl, and whose corpse was flung into the vents stinking Thames. Importantly, rail have based their groovy sounds on three on all three sources. This does make it rather difficult to pinpoint exactly which bit of the plot or plot is being evoked in each piece. To take just one example, the fourth track baffling calcium Lenten light, could refer equally well to the barnyard scene in the new film, the Casa incognita episode in the western, or indeed, to the bit in the Jacobean drama, where the audience always shuddered. matches it would be helpful to summarize the plot of one or all of the sources, it has to be said that is a hopeless task. The original Jacobean tragedy is a scheme of untangle not the western is dense and brooding. And the latest film is frankly incoherent in the best sense of the word. How the director managed to pull the whole thing together without any bees or beekeepers is a triumph, albeit a strange one. Yes, the director. Rumor has it that behind the person who appears in the interminable credits looks the eerie finger of Horst jack. It was he who was really pulling the strings. He who took the play in the Western and decided to transform them into something quite unprecedented. It is said that he pored over all known texts of the drama for over a decade, and sat through thousands of screenings of the Western, sometimes alone and sometimes accompanied by his mysterious wife and collaborator, Primrose dent, it might even be that the whole thing is the brainchild of Primrose herself.

Certainly, It was she who got real on board to create the musical soundtrack. She tracked the band down to a squalid cafeteria in pointy town, where they had been retained as the regular afternoon entertainment. The cafeteria clientele an intriguing Gumball of metal clothes, Jesuits, pin cushion sales reps, mounted banks, Presti, digitated and yes, beekeepers, were so distraught when they learned that Primrose plan to whisk the band away to expensive rehearsal studios in a Swiss Canton, that they rioted. Wiley Primrose filmed the brouhaha and inserted the raw footage into the unfinished into the finished version of the fatal duck pond. Unfortunately for us, she shot without sound, so the band was unable to incorporate the Danish shouting, thumping, smashing and whatnot into the piece accompanying this section of the film. All in all, despite its perplexing boundlessness This is a tremendous album, even for those who have never seen the film to which acts as a soundtrack. And quite honestly, the listener is probably better off not having to sit through hours of bad acting, blurry visual effects, gruesome, smudgy, charcoal burnings blank screens, hectoring ranks from unseen crew members, and still shots of daffodils strewn fields.

This next piece begins with a weather forecast. But it's not a real weather forecast. So please don't take any notice of it in terms of how it will be tomorrow. rain clouds will sweep in from the west before lunchtime. Thunder will brew across parks and woodland stand unconscious squirrels will lie scattered upon the ground. In tall buildings, electrical wiring systems will fizz and pop tarnished silver will listen a new the pontiff will appear on his balcony. Watch the way he moves his arms. Solvay grinds tall in the saddle. He has had a shampoo and rinse so even applied subtle dyes to his hair. He has perfected the art of making an omelet without breaking any eggs. so vague has lost his good old mama and must have whiskey or you know why. He two moves his arms in that distinctively paced manner. In a copyist, one of the squirrels regained consciousness, it skitters up a tree, a large or a laburnum water coppice. From far off there is a rumble of thunder. looking west, the squirrel from its high vantage point sees solve eggs good old mama approaching across the fields, her arms are hidden in the folds of an old red shawl. tungsten manufacturer continues apace in the buena the plant is too noisy for the southern sheets of pelting rain to be heard hitting the roof. Magnus is in his cubicle, checking some paperwork. There is garlic on his breath and garlic to a whole clove encased in the ceramic pod slung around his neck on a lanyard. Behind him on the wall hangs a crucifix. The pinned Christ there on his dogged with red to mimic Gore. Magnus moves his arms restlessly at the foot of the mountain. So as a squalid village Solveig was born here. Today it has more goats than people. The people don't need a park, but they have got one a municipal park with lawns and flower beds and volleyball courts and a bandstand and a duck pond and a paddling pool for children. When it was laid out by prisoners of war, it had beacons status. Now it is overrun by goats. Truth of Christ in the center of one of the Lord's shows him with one arm raised in benediction. The other arm was snapped off long ago. In a crevice in a rock at the bottom of the sea, a demersal being opens one cold alien I hit the summons the rain clouds from the west. It summons the thunder.

In the park in the drained paddling pool, the goats run amok. You will find many many goats in the Bible, but no squirrels and no demersal blobs. One such blob clung like a barnacle to the submerged timber of the ark. And then it came loose and sank to the bottom of the sea. Arms are moved towards where the sea must be from far inland. lunchtime, the rain clouds burst.

One of the more startling works of Dobson was the text often called the joke pamphlet, dubbed such because it's opening lines are almost identical to one of those gags that begins there was an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. It's the least read of Dobson's pamphlets by a long chalk. Something this may be due to the work itself being sort of a joke perpetrated by an anti Dobson list. And that's not part of the canon. Equally it could be argued that the very rarity of the pamphlet has led to it being neglected. Most estimates conclude that only three copies were backed out on marigold tues stettner machine in her crumbling shed. The pamphlet begins last. There was a neto psychist a psychopath anarchist and an annihilationist and they were loitering in a graveyard. So neto psychist held that the souls of persons and beasts perish along with their physical bodies, and that both body and soul are resurrected at the Last Judgement. The psychopath anarchist believes that the soul sleeps in the grave to be awoken at the end. The annihilationist, as his name indicated, said that there was no resurrection at all for either the body or the soul. Clearly, any sensitive reader would not be expecting Dobson to follow this with a comic punch line. This is a serious pamphlet by a serious pamphleteer that follows a lengthy conversation between the trio written in stilted artificial and highly wrought prose, which Dobson disastrously tries to render in a variety of regional accents, choosing regions where he had never been out of which he knew nothing. Indeed, it may be that the pamphlet has attracted so few readers because it is virtually unreadable. But as ever with the out of print, pamphleteer, persistence pays off. Ted Kak has gone so far as to claim that it's Dobson's finest, bravest, most valiant work. But then he's probably just showing off. One might be forgiven for thinking that the conversation between the neto psychist the psychopath anarchist and the annihilationist, which makes up the bulk of the pamphlet consists of each arguing their case against the other, but it swiftly becomes apparent that this is not Dobson's purpose at all. Well, it becomes swiftly apparent once one gets to grips with the tortured pros, but if one has to struggle, it becomes slowly apparent. In my case, it took about seven years hard slog sitting up on Light reading by the light of tallow candles shivering in a blanket to reach a vague understanding of this mighty text. Rather than a standard mortar list debate about the fate of the body and soul after death, were treated to a sequence of what can only be called rants by the three protagonists upon familiar daab sonian themes, shipping timetables, foreign boot manufacture, breathtaking ornithological ignorance and so on, interspersed with passages in which ghouls rise from the tombs in the graveyard and dance a sort of Terran teller. Obviously, the pamphleteer is playing with his readers here, in a quite on Dobson ish manner, our moorings are loosened, and we're set adrift, we wonder, or at least I wondered by about page 44. If we're heading for a Maelstrom, like something out of Edgar Allan Poe. we cling on though, trusting in Dobson to rescue us and rescue us he does.

In the final pages of the pamphlet, the dancing ghouls Harry the stiletto psychist into one of the graves, chop up the psycho panic kissed with a ghoul axes and pushed the annihilationist up a gum tree, which just happens to be growing in a corner of the graveyard, and which we have glimpsed briefly earlier in the text. When one of the protagonists, it's not clear which given the stultifying density of the pros, shins up it and taps it for GM to make a point about tapping GM from GM trees. The goals then do a final little dance, more hopping about in truth before returning to their tombs. But of course, one tomb is newly occupied by the stricken neto psychist leaving a single goal with nowhere to rest. This goon wonders out of the graveyard through the grim iron gate, past the cake shop and the colonic irrigation theme park and the butchers and the performing pinhead person's plinth and then vanishes into a mist and mist reminiscent of the one that swallows up Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. The ghoul is bound we know not where and nor does Dobson tell us is in short, a tour de force, albeit one that's maddeningly difficult to make sense of. Oddly, not one of the giants of prog rock ever adapted it for a concept album. One can only imagine what a terrific gatefold sleeve would have been designed for the original vinyl release. And with what them adenoidal us would have carved Dobson's name into their school desks with a penknife. Is there one wonders, a parallel universe where such things came to be? And is there a piece of boffin re that could take us there a way away, away from the sludge and gristle of our hapless hell.

Excuse me more about Dobson now. On the Day Happy Drake's died. Dobson was slumped in the vestibule of a large and shabby hotel to which had been summoned by a captain of industry. The out of print pamphleteer was on the verge of his dotage, but was not quite there yet. If anything, his lucidity was terrifying. There were egg stains on his cravat. The captain of industry failed to turn up leaving Dobson in the lurch at a loose end and with barely a penny in his pocket. He slumped in the vestibule. The hotel did not have a commission air or indeed, anybody who cared that a pamphleteer was blocking the entrance smelling thankfully of egg haffi Drake's died of a heart attack on the sixth of October 1980. The captain of industry whom Dobson was expecting to meet had died a day earlier. Nobody thought to look in his appointments diary, even if they had it would have been flummoxed them. For the captain of industry used an unbreakable code. He did this to lend himself an air of it. importance of Norman wisdom with whom she appeared in the square peg and follower star. Hattie Drake's said he was, quote, difficult and self centered, unquote. The same could be said of Dobson. Indeed, he wrote as much in a pamphlet entitled why I can be difficult and self centered out of print, presenting an obstacle to anyone who wanted to enter or to leave the semi dilapidated hotel that afternoon, but was but one instance of this. A number of people stepped over the slumped pamphleteer that day. Some even trod on him, so frantic was their haste. Dobson did not complain that he was past comparing. He was composing an essay in his head, as he often did, so that when he returned eventually to his escrow, or he could scribble away at high speed. Sometimes he wrote so quickly that he scorched his note paper. The date captain of industry had arranged to meet Dobson because he wanted the pamphleteer to write his biography. As we have seen, he had a massive and delusional sense of his own importance, and felt that only a master of majestic sweeping pros such as Dobson could do justice to his life. By any objective measure, it had been a colorless and god awful life, devoted almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of buttons. Happy Drake's sported many buttons made by the capital of industries button company during the Second World War, when she worked as an arc welder. The company provided the welding factory with all its buttons and made its fortune in so doing. It was in the arc welding factory that Hattie Jake's nurtured her comic talents. Dobson had been apprised of the reason there's a board meeting and slumps in the vestibule was tussling with a title the life of a button near appeals to him. But there was already a book of that name and adventure story by the best selling paperback is pebble head set in Wivenhoe and cuxhaven. A rip roaring an emotionally wrenching roller coaster ride exclaimed the review in books reviews with lots of exclamation marks magazine. Like Hattie Drake's ex husband, john le measurer, the captain of industry had arranged his own death notice to appear in the newspaper. It read, decisively important maker of buttons is dead. keep buying his buttons, so his name lives on for thousands of years. One of the people who trod on Dobson in the hotel vestibule, dropped his newspaper as he did so and the page with the button his death notice came to rest upon the pamphlet, his egg stained cravat, he made no attempt to move it. Had he Jake's was buried in St Paul's churchyard in London. The captain of industries body light undiscovered in his capitani penthouse flat, where it was ignored by rats and mice. Eventually, it was tossed into a furnace by a feckless janitor. The shabby hotel vestibule was not Dobson's final resting place, thank God. At some point in the evening of that October day, he'd be stirred himself

scrunched up the newspaper that had fallen on him and shoved it into his pocket, finessed the cravat about his neck and plotted home difficult and self centered, like Norman wisdom along lamp lit streets. He had a while left before his dotage descended upon him.

Look over there, beyond the pond and the puddles and that ramshackle owl enclosure and the ditches. Now count the ditches. You see there are 123 of them. Take this telescope. Can you see why beyond the third ditch across the flat mark, there is another ditch. That is the last ditch. That is where we're headed. Give me back the telescope and take my hand. I have a polzeath hand and a withered arm unsightly scars hidden under my cloak the results of a botched medical procedure. It was both invasive and pointless. I sent further withering of other limbs and appendages. Call it guesswork or hypochondria, I feel it in my water. That's why I'm so keen to get to the last ditch. It's where I will wallow, pending the last trump. You must help me across the pond and through the puddles and pass the owl enclosure and then over 123 ditches and then through the flat Mark until we get to the last ditch. After that it's up to you. You can come on wallow with me or turn around and make your way back. Either way, keep hold of your first aid kit. It's of no use to me. It's interesting that the carrion crows are hovering over the pond on the puddles rather than over the ditches. I suppose. They have a completely different perspective up there, big winged and raucous. My wife became a crow, the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman cast the spell on her. And off she flew. I was standing by the pond in a puddle watching my crow wife soar through the sky. I took out my telescope to follow her until she vanished in the blue batch when I saw the last ditch for the first time. I thought it was just another ditch the fourth one after those three you can see from here. I suppose there were other ditches beyond it a fifth and sixth and so on as the flat marks stretches to the horizon. But one day, I put on my hiking boots and carried a stick and strode out that way for miles. This was before the witterings Of course, before the medical procedure. I had vim, I walked all day and all night, and I got as far as the mountains, but didn't come across any other ditches. That really is the last ditch. Do you remember his van? I heard that he carried on past the last ditch all the way to the mountains as I did. But instead of turning back he started climbing. Of course. He had grappling hooks and pylons and sturdy rope. So he was prepared. His vim may made mine seem like latitude. I received one postcard from him. It was ice cold to the touch after that, nothing

and that is the end of this week's hooting yard on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it various little stories to provoke thought and and Brian numbness and next week I'll be talking about slop in the pan, which some of you may know was a favorite Victorian treat from street street stalls in the East End, swapping the pan that'll be next week along with some other stuff. That's all from me. Bye bye.
