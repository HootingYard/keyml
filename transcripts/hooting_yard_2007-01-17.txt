Afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. It's time for hooting yard on the air with me, Frank key. I think before reading a story is to you, there's a piece of information I want to share. You know how you find things out every now and then and sometimes things that seem really interesting. Well, it's interesting to me. Did you know that one of the favorite activities of President Richard Nixon was mashing potatoes? True, strange, but true. President Nixon enjoyed mashing potatoes. This this is called Total Eclipse. One day after a huge breakfast, ignite fondo had a Total Eclipse of the Heart, just like that songstress whose name escapes me. What was her name? Bonnie Tyler. That's right. He did not look as if it was happening. Indeed, To the untrained eye, ignite fondo looked as if he was asleep, rather than than the throes of convulsive emotional turmoil accompanied by strident rock music. Adding to the disjuncture was the fact that ignite fondo resembled Clement Attlee down to the finicky moustache and an inadvisable line in hats. Nevertheless, when he went to his priest for confession the following Sunday, there could be no doubt about the upheavals of his passion. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. He pleaded as he knelt facing the grill behind which the priest sat cluttering his rosary beads and wishing he was Montgomery Clift in I confess, I have had a Total Eclipse of the Heart. Let me stop you there my child murmur to the priest. I have heard enough, say three our fathers for Hail Marys on one and evil cradling by Brian Keenan. Now get you gone. Ignite fan, though left the confessional. Soon afterwards, so did the priest his own heart not so much in total eclipse as heavy with the weight of the fat black since he had had to listen to all morning terrible, terrible Sins of impiety and vain glory and greed of abandonment and lust of twiddly Moog synthesizer, solos, Ray pine, pillage and rack. He imagined each seen as a lump of lead, and he stuffed them all into a sack. It was a burlap sack, tied up with a knot, and he hoisted it onto his back. His back was broad and his shoulders were strong, and he carried the sack through all day long, the sack of sins as black as his heart, and at nightfall, he tossed it onto a cart. he reigned up his horse in the Milky moons glow, And off he rode with the sack on the cart, ignite fondo tossed and turned in his attic of sin with his Total Eclipse of the Heart. Dawn came ignite found out I woke, refreshed. All sin washed away, a man who now was pure, far, far away on the road to the limekilns the priest with his horse and cart and sack full of sin had stopped to drink water from a stream. It was a pretty real, as if in a dream. The songstress Bali Tyler appeared standing in the long grass, dressed in no longer fashionable glam refinery. There was a sudden din Was it the music of the spheres as conceived in the mind of Brian May, the priest clapped his hands over his his, his horse reared up in terror, and the burlap sack exploded. It's incandescence, vaporizing the sun, the blast almost as loud as the songstress and her band belting out her anthem. This March have I seen this much have I heard

serpentine Claude had been in a gale. I asked him what sort of Gale it was. I've got a lot of time for serpentine Claude, howling he said, my my a howling Gale was the nubbin of my reply. Was there a snap? Claude, who is a Pluto kratt with a thing about Mary Pickford said there was a snap and it was cold. I was beginning to picture serpentine Claude in a howling Gale during a cold snap, but I was hungry for further details. Claude misinterpreted my expression, and handed me a pie. He is serpentine but generous, as well as plutocratic. It was a very tasty pie, and I ate it at once. It was a puff pastry pie with a filling of filberts and be barage. While I queued, Claude told me that the Gale during the snap was accompanied by rain. I did not want to speak with my mouth full of pie, and before I could ask Claude to describe the nature of the rain, he rushed away along that old canal towpath hectic with Fox gloves to a festival of Mary Pickford films being shown at the shipshape cinema in 10. Tara beam I swallowed the last of the pie, hoisted my binoculars and took careful note of a swallow perched on the bow of a sycamore over to the west. Or it might have been a Finch. I'm always getting the mixed up ever since the railway accident. I have a psychic premonition of it, just like the hundreds of people who foresaw in their dreams, the sinking of the Titanic in April 1912. There is a good book by George baihe, which catalogues them. One day, I may find out if anyone else shared my premonition of the railway accident, and I too might collect them into a book. Years later, I received a letter from serpentine, Claude, this is what he wrote, dear is van it has long been on my conscience through all the years that I ensnared the world in my Pluto cratic web, that I may have mistaken your look of fixated curiosity about the Gale during the snap for one of simple hunger. That is why I gave you the last of my puff pastry filbert and be borage pies, but I was wrong, wasn't I? I think I knew I was wrong, within minutes of stalking off along that foxglove strewn towpath, but to my shame, I did not turn back to rectify my error. I was so hot for Mary Pickford, that I gave you nary another thought. Please accept my apologies. And let me at long last tell you what your heart has burned to know through all the succeeding years through the rains on earth of a fair few pontiffs in the howling Gale, during the Cold Snap, the rain was torrential. It fell in Torrance, you will faithfully, serpentine Claude.

before reading the next story, which is called massacre of the innocence of Hoon, I just want to remind listeners that there is now a book available paperback book, the best of hooting yard on the air or not the best or 52 stories. And it's called befuddled by cormorants. And it's available online only. If you go to the resonance website and go to the shop, you can order it there or you can go to the hooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org and order it from there and I hope you do and this is called massacre of the innocence at Hoon splattered with see gold right droppings. The woman of twigs stood at the very edge of the cliff her back to the sea. barefoot, she rocked gently back and forth on her impromptu podium. The villagers were gathered about her wretched and snuggling. Some carried pitchforks or dainty little tin boxes for a bit. They were all ears as they waited for the woman of twigs to speak. She had blindfolded herself with a threadbare bandage, bound her hair into tuft with flax and the yarn and roots, and held in her hands a ribbon of bloody silk, precisely at the moment that the thousandth wave of the day crashed against the rocks below. The woman of twigs seest her rocking, cast the ribbon to the winds and shouting to make herself heard over the screeching goals began. You asked me to save the village from doom. I have communed with a variety of weird and tiresome shades to seek guidance. You are correct, your village is imperiled. There is only one way to rescue it from the coming agony. Three of your number must travel many miles distant to the town of Hoon, there, they must find a churn possibly broken the churn of Hoon, which has had engraved upon it, or rather factoring likeness of myself. Do not ask why, having scoured Hoon for this turn and found in Hoon, this churn of Hoon, it must be brought back here with Drew haste and hurled into the boiling sea from this very spot on the Cliff's edge. That task complete your village will once again no Glee, I have left on mentioned one crucial point, the three who will venture to whom they're to find and return the whom turn must all be called Ned. That is all. Work began at once on building the chariot. In the kitchens. The villagers boiled up huge iron pans full of mud and silt. Greg from the riverbed. trees were felled in the spinny. The Smitty at his Anvil beat out a goodly number of nails, spikes and very sharp hooks. Within a week, the foul smelling but indestructible vehicle was ready. Volunteers fanned out across the countryside to trap a suitable beast of burden. Horses, oxen, even a crippled reindeer of great elegance was sighted and stalked, but another week elapsed without success. Eventually, it was decided that the three Ned's would have to travel under their own steam pulling the chariot by themselves. Ned, Ned and Ned agreed, drooling with excitement in their eagerness to set out on so glorious a journey, one that would save the village and bring them renown. They left the village at a gallop in the middle of the night. Without maps they relied entirely on local law and superstition. from infancy each Ned had been imbued with a long Catechism of saws and Proverbs. Now, each had engraved upon his skull, a different couplet handed down through the generations. If you wish to go to Hoon, spit three times and follow the moon hoons beyond young crumpled hedge, hemmed around by gorse and said, when you see eight pebbles strewn, you're eight days and nights from a hoon.

They traveled without pools to dragging the stinking chariot, while the third lay bundled in it sleeping or feeding from a polythene bag full of curdled slops. At first they followed the course of the great frightening river until suddenly it wormed its way underground. For 18 months, they traveled through a desolate landscape flat gray and curiously redolent of shirred. But as they entered hoons hinterland, things changed. in rapid succession, they passed and asbestos works a barrel of rainwater accustoms post damp Hector's elk encampments, fence posts, grotesque wooden carvings, horrifying shrubbery, improbable water tables, Jerry built huts, a kailyn quarry lumps of disgust monsters gulches nebulous structures stretchers have pointed brambly things, ornithologists hideaways, parakeet enclosures, quarantines, sheds, Rusk markets strange garbage sludge, a tremendous farm yard and burials are vacuum wrestling pythons extravagant banks of yellow fog, yeast traffickers and a zipper crushing factory. Ned said tornado Ned soon we should all be in hoon. I can feel it in my water. He was not mistaken. The great South Gate of Hoon was over 1000 years old and completely overgrown by clumps of hideous fleshy foliage, oozing poisonous SAP. All attempts to destroy this abominable vegetation had met with failure, and it had not been possible to open the gate for at least two centuries. Rather than blasting a hole in the town wall, a ramshackle lift contraption was knocked up close by two wooden platforms. One other either side of the Great Wall were raised and lowered by an exciting system of pistons pulleys and winches, operated by a team of gatekeepers wearing boa constrictor masks. In return for their labors. They exacted a hefty price. Unfortunately, the three Ned's were utterly panelists. mattering among themselves are heroic trio decided to profit gifts in lieu of payment. Ned offered the gatekeepers his cap, which was made of rusted whisks. Ned presented them with a sick Toad he had been pampering for the past month, Ned gave them a handful of silt scraped from the underside of the chariot. well pleased with these gifts, the gatekeepers allowed the exhausted threesome to clamber onto the platform. Two days later, the three Ned's were lowered to the ground on the other side of the wall. At last they were in hoon. Finding the possibly broken churn of Hoon could only be a matter of time. They would be implacable ferreting into every corner of the ancient town. As soon as they disembark from the wooden platform, however, they were set upon by our whirling tangle of ruffians, who backed them senseless, stole our shirts off their backs, empty their polythene bags of slops into the gutter holy dismantled the chariot, had at them with ferocious scimitars and left them for dead. And indeed, Ned and Ned were dead. Ned was carted off by a passing stretcher patrol, but panted his last breath An hour later, by which time the rough Ian's at scampered away, heading for the mountains. They stopped by the kailyn quarry to eat their pack lunches, and then as night came down, they strode up the mountainside, these ruffins their gazes fixed on the sky above, to look at the number of stars to view the boundless firmament.

I mentioned the book befuddled by coumarins by me And now I'd like to do a book review of a different book, A thumping great tome lands on the reviews editor's desk. It is nothing less than the incredibly detailed report of the Commission of Inquiry into the provision of public transport services in and around hooting yard, as requested by civic functionaries many many years ago. It would one fields be a kindness simply to burn the thing. After all, is anyone ever going to read it apart from me? Did it not occur to its compilers that decades old research cannot simply be written up over the succeeding years with agonizing slowness, and retain any validity. One notes that the authors have opted to remain anonymous or semi anonymous, in that they've given their identities only in the form of cryptic crossword clues. Thus we have spigot in lane gets Plank with Dutch cheese for eight the general editor dad's pie on hinge six nine and P which churchgoer frantic with collapsed lung says monster eight seven, the associate editors tenebrous. elke, perhaps 1012 deputy editor sounds like miasma of clack on greubel holds sideways seven seven picture editor and not forgetting large pig on holiday Island six nine in turn, as the great Terry Thomas used to say, what an absolute shower. This enormous volume is basically a mishmash of reasonable twaddle. Take this for example, and I quote, the gorgeous evaporators which ply the canals of hooting yard are run by a forward thinking company, which emblazoned all its vessels with a startling logo of a budgerigar? unquote. It's difficult to conceive of a sentence of similar length, which contains so many errors. Or take this the bus route between blister lane and the dyeworks it's true pava has won many awards for its revolutionary approach to timetabling, not least the employment of little Severin, the mystic badger, a real badger, who predicts the timing of the buses by doing something or other with his paws. Little severine is kept in a hatch at the bus Depo and has become a star of local press and radio. He has also become the official sponsor of the annual cake show. And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, how is this for blithering inanity quote again, the infrastructure of the pneumatic railway system with its nerve center on Yoko Ono Boulevard was designed upon the territorial patterns of the funnel web spider, hence the breathtaking beauty of the interchanges, sightings and station tea rooms. Unquote. dismissing the text with a groan of disgust, the reader turns to the maps, charts, statistical tables and dependencies, hoping that here at least some sense maybe run from this preposterous book. All I can say is that it looks to me as if the work was farmed out to a gaggle of the younger inmates in the lunatic wing of Pang Hill orphanage. What we have here, and it takes up over a third of the book as a whole is a hideous collection of dorbz, blobs and scribbling, nor does it help that most of the pages appear to have been dusted with egg yolk and breadcrumbs. There are those who will say that this undoubtedly imposing publication is a bargain costing just eight pains 40 and then I am merely a cantankerous and grumpy reviewer with an axe to grind. Because my essay the psychic significance of a flat fare structure for all journeys on the fiendish pond, swivel engine gas powered sub Aqua taxi service was excised by the publishers at the last minute on the clearly ridiculous grounds that it was pompous and self interested, have they no shame. Overall writing bilge

first there was a flask of tea to be screwed shot and cloud patterns to be analyzed, with the aid of diagrams drawn on clear plastic from a pile kept in a locker by the boiler room, which was always locked even on Thursdays when inspectors came three of them driving up in a sort of van that looked like it had been built behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s but was remarkably almost brand new. As you could learn if you took a close look at it once it had been parked rather sloppily. Next to that incredible cedar tree on the branches of which dozens upon dozens of birds perched. Let us not catalog the birds there is not enough time for that, except to remark that the tree was innocent of owls and always had been for reasons known only to ornithologists, particularly the resident ornithologist, that insouciance man who always wore velvet there was talk that his only inheritance when his parents perished in a funicular railway accident in some distant mountain range or other was a bolt of mowed crushed velvet. But I don't know the truth of that. I don't know the truth of anything. I don't even know what time it is. I haven't slept for a week. I lie awake all night terrified of my familiar, the tiny invisible Goblin that scampers around. In my room and knows that the curtains and the wind Scott first there was a flask of tea to be screwed shot. And then the boisterous man went paddling and a fresh puddle, having kicked off his big boots and hung his socks on a fence. Well, I was that boisterous man. I was a happy splasher until my invisible Goblin came to stay.

Of course, hitting yard is is not just the work of me. I have a staff of many, many helpers. And we've hooting yard we've taken on a new member of staff to assist us in all matters ornithological the interview process was exhausting, possibly because our recruitment advert by some mishap appeared in be People Magazine instead of jobs for the bird obsessed, which was our publication of choice. That misunderstanding dealt with we questioned What in the name of heaven had persuaded us to hold the selection process in the annex of a house of sorted legend magic hard by the banks of a tempestuous river on the point of bursting its banks 14 miles from the nearest railway station. We eventually appointed Jim pond, a man with a blue hat and dozens of library tickets, who suggested that his first contribution ought to be some birdsongs, the lapwing the Curlew, and quite alarmingly, the carrion crow. So Jim went off to make recordings. But he's now apparently gone off to join the Richard Milhouse Nixon Memorial sweat lodge, and it's unclear if he's ever coming back. And this is a story to end today's program called with a Blenkinsop. More a question than a story with a Blenkinsop. It's a question I've asked myself Oh, dozens of times in the past fortnight. That was when I last saw him the Titanic blob of a man as he trundle away for me I bought his self constructed Space Age Uber tractor heading he said for the big disused radish cannery near crap wing. So far as anyone knows, he never arrived. his vehicle uncannily riddled with what looked like age old rust was found in a thicket, as if deliberately concealed by a malefactor. A boot which may have belonged to Blenkinsop late in the market a few yards away. There were signs that an attempt had been made to remove the boot lace which was splattered with stains of an unknown and possibly extraterrestrial substance. A fabulous blue mordant herons gathered in a clump nearby seem to be suffering the ill effects of this goo whatever it was. Then on Thursday, the night editor of The Daily spasm took delivery of a parcel. It had been in expertly wrapped in corrugated cardboard, and smelled of pig reluctant to divulge the content. The news hound handed it to the police who sent it to their Forensic Laboratory, which burned to the ground the next day, when a rookie lab assistant carelessly discarded or not quite spent Lucifer in a wastepaper basket containing a petri dish of something monstrous invisible and volatiles concocted by the evil experimental is Dr. turp, who had inveigled his way into the lab through a combination of Charmin coming. Now it is known that Dr. turp once belong to the same hat collecting club as Blenkinsop. For this reason alone, he was taken into custody by the Dowty, inspector Brazil, not on the day after the fire. This morning, I purchased a railway ticket, and in a few minutes, I shall board the train to crap ring, where I shall confront Dr. turb as he stands arraigned in the dock of the assizes and I shall blow his brains out with a fat and shiny pistol. And that brings us to the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. So I hope you've enjoyed it and I'll see you again next week. Bye bye.
