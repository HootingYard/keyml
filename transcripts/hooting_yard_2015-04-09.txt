now imagine the scene. It was shortly after breakfast time on a cold and storm tossed morning in the 1950s the home of the 20th century's most magnificent pamphleteer Dobson Dobson had eaten his bloaters marigold crew had something eggy they were still sitting at their breakfast table. Outside hailstones what pinging. marigold Oh my darling dear boomed Dobson. I have devised a marvelous plan. Listen carefully. You often comment upon what you consider to be my breathtaking ignorance of the natural world. And though I usually SWAT away your charges as a giant my swatter wild dwarf I have this day found within myself a reservoir of humility. And I must admit there is a certain truth in what you say. marigold true interrupted here to suggest she captured Dobson's words upon a tape recorder for the settling of any future contract on but the pamphleteer pressed on. That being so he said, My plan is to increase my knowledge in the best way possible and what method couldn't be more efficacious than to write a book about what I do not know. And not just any book, I shall take as my guide that great ancient encyclopedia by Pliny the Elder, the natural history and rewrite it in its entirety to ensure I cover the sweeping width and breadth of all natural phenomena, I shall follow slavish Lee the chapter and section headings of the great work, but sub joined to them, the text shall be my own. Is that not a fantastic plan and a superb way to extend my knowledge of that which you claim me to be ignorant of. Again, I think if I am to be grammatically sound Are you sure you mean subjoined Dobson asked marigold to who was in cackle some mood. I am not 100% certain No, but let that pass Oh my enamorado The thing is, I have decided to begin the project this very day, not at the beginning, but climbing straight into the 10th book of plenty, which you will recall is the one in which he addresses matters ornithological. That is an area in which you suggest my ignorance is boundless and unfathomable, so it will be the perfect test bed. And no, I'm not sure I mean, test bed, but let that pass to for the time being. I'm quite happy to do so. Said marigold true. For now my eggy breakfast is digested. I'm going off and out to a beekeeping banana Bonanza jamhuri get the two is Grimoire and when I return, I shall be happy to have you read to me the initial scribblings of your natural history. A book I'm sure will knock plenty from his Plymouth Dobson took this rep Artie in good part, scurried to his escrow trois, sharpen the pencil and flung open his dusty copy of Pliny the 10th book. The nature of birds wanted to the ostrich, the Phoenix he read, he closed his eyes and tried to summon a vision of an ostrich and a Phoenix. First separately, then together. He was determined not to cheat by reading what Pliny the Elder had had to say on the subject nearly 2000 years ago. Then, the pamphleteer shook his head, like a man waking from a jarring dream, opened his eyes and began to scribble with his sharpened pencil. On the first page of a brand new Notepad. Both the ostrich and the Phoenix he wrote a bird, the one real the other mythical. On the front of the head of the real bird, there is a beak, and lo, what did we find on the front of the head of the bird of myth? It two has a beak. And this is not the only feature they have in common for the bodies of both birds bear plumage in the form of feathers. Dobson looked upon what he had done and saw that it was good. No doubt there would be more to say about both the ostrich and the Phoenix, but he felt he had at the very least, cracked the method he planned to employ. Plenty would be his guide, but only his guide. The grand sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose would be Dobson's alone. He went to take a post breakfast nap.

Frank Key  18:47
When he woke the pamphlet, his brain was befuddled after a series of dreams. The details of which so vivid in sleep, vanished. The instant his head rose from the pillow. He opened a can of re vivifying sculpture and poured it into a tumbler, then sat again at his s Grimoire to consult his cleany eagles, vultures, hawks, owls, woodpeckers. It was a long, long list of things with beaks and feathers. Dobson threw his pencil across the room, donned his great coat and his Belgian post office inspectors boots and went out in the teeth of the hailstorm to trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal to clear his head. He saw a number of birds while on his trudge, not one of which was either an ostrich or a Phoenix. He threw a pebble at a swan. He stopped in our mar purgatives canalside lobster hatchery and winter sports togs bizarre, and browsed among the lobsters and the winter sports togs. But in spite of the old ma offering bargains galore in a special hailstorms I'll Dobson in mired in penury has ever bought nothing. Eventually, he trudged back home, passing the puddle in which the pebble had thrown at the swan had somehow fetched up as pebbles do. And as pamphleteers do, he returned to his escrow tois sharpened another pencil and draw setting determination cast his eye over the Pliny, peacocks, bastard swans who pose partridges, goat suckers. This last reminded Dobson thought he had a goat milk popsicle in the refrigerator, and he was about to go and fetch it for a mid morning snack when, towards the end of the content of Glenys 10s book, he read instances of affection between snakes and a bomb exploded inside his brain. Suddenly, Dobson recalled the dream from which he had awoken befuddled after his nap. He remembered it in every last detail for it with his recurring dream, the one that flickered in his sleeping cranium on so so many nights. And in so, so many daytime naps, and had done since infancy. He turned to refresh pager his notepad and began scribbling. When I was a taught, he wrote, I had a favorite bedtime story, which I implored my mom or Parr to read to me before I fell asleep. I drank my bedtime beaker of milk of magnesia and settled my little head on my little pillow, and listened, Night after night, to the tale which ever since has haunted my dreams, and about which it is in comprehensible that I have not written a pamphlet until today. Well, thanks to Pliny the Elder. Now I can address that admission. The story began as follows. Once upon a time, there was a boa constrictor named dagobert he was loitering on a verdant slope when he happened to spot a passing vole dagobert uncoiled himself, pounced, sank his fangs into the tiny roll, and gulped it down in one fangs a mouthful. But before his digestive juices could begin to reduce the paralyzed but yet living roll into nourishing pump, a long time of Viper named cloth guard. Mio my thought Daigo bird. What a lovely Viper she is. I feel a great pang of affection for her cloth God herself was a sore vexed Viper freshly had not eaten for many days. Oh boa constrictor loitering on the verdant slope. Can Steve help us all vexed Viper who has not eaten for many days? My name is cross guard hissed cross guard. So mighty were the pangs of affection felt by dagobert that he immediately regurgitated the role and offered it to the famished Viper. Why thank you, she hissed. You are quite the most charming Bella constrictor it has ever been my pleasure to meet. There was more to the story much more but it was always around this point that as a taught, I fell into my golden slumbers and Mark oppa place the storybook gently by my pillow and tiptoed away

Frank Key  23:48
that passage you will recognize I expect as the opening of Dobson's important pamphlet, the significance in my long ago infancy of an undyed jested vole out of print. He was still scribbling away furiously possessed by a pamphlet his demons. When marigold Chu arrived home, thinking he was at work on his revision of plenty. She did not interrupt him, but went straight into the back garden with the new bees she had bought back brought back from the Bonanza jam Berry. Not until a few days later, when she asked Dobson if he had yet written his chapter on the nature of puff eggs, adult eggs and winged eggs. did she learn that the pamphleteer had abandoned his plenty? Oh, that he said over breakfast. It's just one bird after an hour. I can't be doing with it.

I'm not quite a list, but almost another list or two Now, depending on how much time we have left. There's quite a while since I've read to you. Excuse me anything from further science book 20. by Norman Davis, longtime listeners will know this is actually my favorite book. It's a small, a six yellow covered spineless book with no publishing details whatsoever. Other than it is written by Norman Davis, in 2001 is called further science book 20. And I have never clapped eyes on books one to 19 matches I would love to. Here's Norman Davis on flower varieties. One, that there are two extremes of thick and thin flower stems to the thick stem has dry silvery foliage and woolly leaf on drier soils further north and east than the far southwest Devon Cornwall, wet or narrow stem type Malayan glands. Three, pointing to thick stems seeking to maximize water intake via salt for that old walls cause yellow flowers to become both purple and perennial. Five rhizomes increased flower size in wetter areas. The wetter the more granulate creeping in wet wind woods to cover a greater surface area. Six wet spurge leaves Ireland arounded pointed in drier southeast England purple to hotter South seven that white bed straws coagulate milk orchids orchids promised the flow of milk opposites of the wet chalk environment. Eight also bed straws and die are spindly, prickles, granular non parasitic, common climbers non gland sea cliffs, soft straw, nine orchids are non die, thick, fleshy, non prickles or glands or granules, rare inland SAP pro fight non climber no straw, etc. Opposite This is such a great book I could I could go on and on and on. I'm gonna read you some more of it next week. And like next week, I'm going to read you Maine's location and two birds psychologies. That's something to look forward to. Until then, I wish you farewell. Thanks again to Amanda Wilson for sending me one list. Thanks to Pliny the Elder for a second list. And Norman Davis for a third list. Ish, sort of numbered paragraphs almost a list. Bye bye.
