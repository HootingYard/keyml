If you're listening on your computer and it's six o'clock on Thursday the 19th of may if you're listening live, this is being broadcast live. My name is Frankie. This is hosting yard on the air, and this week's show is dedicated to Morty. And some people think surgeon's biscuit is the name of a town near caca dam. Others believe it's an old parlor game popular in the boarding houses of seaside resorts during the 1930s. There are those who suspect it to be the name of a racehorse, or perhaps a Racing Pigeon, or some other bird or beast of Swiftness. surgeon's biscuit is of course, none of these things. It is simply a biscuit that belonged to a surgeon. But what a biscuit and water surgeon as biscuits go It was the finest specimen the surgeon had ever seen two thirds of the way down a perfectly ordinary looking packet of digestive crumbly. There it nestled a numinous almost golden thing, some quirk in its baking, making operably different from its fellows in the back. He remembered when he first handled it. He was not a man to transfer his newly purchased biscuits into a so called biscuit, tin, or similar container. He's ate them straight from the packet, as he had been brought up to do by his rough tough parents in their rough, tough hovel who I'm sorry. Hold on a second. He was not a man to transfer his newly purchased biscuits into a so called biscuit, tin or similar container. He ate them straight from the packet, as he had been brought up to do buyers rough, tough parents in their rough, tough hovel who can never have expected little Vladimir to grow up to become an important surgeon. So on that day, during the last pathetic gasps of the Nixon administration, he took the next brisket from the packet without even looking at it. sitting at his large important desk in his large important consulting rooms. his attention was fixed on page 46 column two line 15 of the hemoglobin monitor were his name appeared misspelled yet again. Why was it he wandered slowly moving the fabulous biscuit from the open packet towards his mouth that despite being the country's most famous surgeon, despite being referred to in virtually every hemoglobin related article of note for the past three decades, not a single medical journal ever managed to spell his name correctly. He was about to bite his biscuit. When something stopped in. A black beetle crawled across the magazine page and came to a dead halt on his name. Vladimir shuddered as if this were some presentment of doom, which indeed it was, and ditched his biscuit eating plan. And it was then that he looked at the biscuit for the first time. He had been holding it for perhaps eight or nine seconds without paying the least attention. Now, as the black beetle sat still on his misspelled name, dying of a rare black beetle disease, he not only saw the biscuit but felted. Indeed, all his senses apprehended this majestic biscuit and a spark lit up in his brain. Just as the last spark in the black beetle brain was extinguished. And he said to himself, I am a great surgeon, and this is a great biscuit, rather than bite into it and chew it and digest this digestive crumbly. I'm going to put it in a box and preserve it, and it will forever be known as the surgeon's biscuit.

Some say the soul of the black beetle escaped its dead shell and imbued the biscuit at that very instant. But black beetles do not have souls, and the biscuit was just a biscuit. And Vladimir himself was only an average terjun albeit a surgeon of enormous learning in the field of hemoglobin, but a surgeon with a deluded and preposterous sense of self importance. And that is the real story of surgeon biscuit.

The following piece contains the word dakka dakka, which is a place where Russian Russian people live in the countryside, and I have no idea whether the correct pronunciation in English is Dhaka or Dhaka. So I'm going to say Dhaka, but it is dapto you can send me a corrective email. It's called stand starlings, pockmarked, mustachioed, and bonkers evil tyrant Uncle Joe Starling stepped out onto the balcony of his dacca he sat down in his deck a deck chair and peered in his bunkers on evil way at a flock of starlings. Stalin's soaring through the blue sky above him. Uncle Joe like curlews more than he liked starlings. And he had once ordered the firing squad for a bird hating apparatchik, who served him. Curlew soup at a ceremonial picnic lunch one summer's afternoon, buddy might Stalin's well enough, and his lips curled into a smile as the birds vanished behind some trees over by the Black Lake. There were bones at the bottom of the Black Lake, not only the bones of small animals which had inadvertently fallen into the lake, and being eaten by the carnivorous fish that swam there, but the bones of the soup maker whose bullet riddled corpse Uncle Joe Starling had had tossed into the burning, churning black water by his minions.

How old was a perfect minion from within his soul birthed an indestructible love for Uncle Joe styling? A love so pure that had been celebrated inverse by national poet Eagles zoo, a verse that was proclaimed now the marriage ceremonies of even the most feckless young peasant couples. There was a wedding taking place in a village near the Dhaka later today, and Uncle Joe had decided to attend as he watched the flock of starlings crossing the sky again, flying back from whence they came. He twisted the little red pneumatic knob on the arm of his Decker Decker to summon his minion have arrived on the balcony within seconds. creaking a little your bones Creek halb observed Starling. And then he cackled unlike the bones of the soup mica, which lie rotting at the bottom of the black like, have all cackled to he always cackled when Starling cackled By cackled together, often at least four or five times a day, whenever they record the number of victims of uncle Joe's firing squads. But they were cruel men, both of them, despite the purity of halabi love. I have decided to perform a song at the wedding this afternoon, said Uncle Joe. So get me the sheet music halb nodding and acknowledgement. How are we headed back inside the data to do as he was big. He did not need to ask which sheets music to fetch for his beloved for Starling only had one song in his repertoire. The song he liked to sing was the windmills of your mind, made famous by novel Harrison, son of the actor Rex Harrison. Rex had many wives both real and fictional. And though it would not be difficult to ascertain which of the wives was no or the mother, I cannot be bothered to find out. I can't however, tell you that Rex and Noah were watching a storm one evening, when a bolt of lightning utterly obliterated a tree directly in front of them.

What sort of tree it was, and whether this act of God was related in any way to the Lord's displeasure. Rex Harrison's performance as the pope in the agony and the ecstasy are both important matters, which require further investigation. The hooting yard Rex Harrison Research Institute is however understaffed present, so unless volunteers sidles up to the entrance flap of the institute's somewhat bedraggled tent in the near future, we're going to have to put this on hold. Now, listen carefully. On the afternoon of that country wedding when Uncle Joe Starling startled the feckless young peasants by striding into their reception, and then divided them by singing the windmills of your mind. He's minyan made a tape recording.

This is a quotation from brilliant orange, the neurotic genius of Dutch football by Michael Schwartz. Sorry, by David winner, but it's a quotation from Michael Schwartz quoted in that book. The political system is designed to be down. If anything exciting, interesting or dramatic ever happens in Dutch politics. It means that something's gone horribly wrong. And moving swiftly on from that, in frigging news from the world of letters, where we the poet Denis bear Ponte has turned his hand to a work of prose fiction. We have received a review copy of the novel entitled The unspeakable. Buddy squalid bit Crump element of tadeo Gobbo, presumably on the basis that we will give it a favorable notice. Last boost Mr. Beer pines bank balance will be flimsily and it means massive of clotted nonsense. That was the verdict of the magazine teachers world upon the first publication of Ulysses by James Joyce. And I'm tempted to say the same about this beer pint book and leave it at that. astonishingly, however, this thousand page tome has already been made a set book for schools, colleges and orphanages throughout the land, which means that you're taught if you have any, or you if you are a taught, will have to become familiar with it. When examination time comes around, everyone's knowledge of Dennis bear pods, fictional Farago will be tested to the full and so public spirited as ever, I'm going to try to save you from wasting your precious time actually having to read the damn thing by telling you what you need to know.

Taught tatio gobo there's a princeling and a fictional renascence City State, clearly meant to remind us of the setting of a Jacobean drama, such as the Korean tragedy by Richard Wolffe finger, as the novel opens, Gobbo is pristine, even an uncreased. If he were a piece of cardboard right behind, he would not be of the corrugated kind. chapter by chapter, we watch as the princeling becomes ever more bit crumbled in a variety of unspeakably squalid ways, until at the end, there is a deus ex machina, and he is unfolded and ironed out. Characters tadeo Gobbo is a crude self portrait of the author sharing his weakness, neurasthenia predilection for twee verse and hypochondria. Many of his big crumpled moments are accompanied by the onset of an imagined disease, such as yours, the bindings. Au flux, black bile, bitter colleague at the Strang Yuri. Bear pond attempts to play off a certain devil may care fishness but this is never convincing. In fact, it is laughably inept. There is a host of secondary characters, the most important being lugubrious, the princelings mad stiletto wielding uncle, bear Ponte is constantly harping on about his frantic black eyebrows, which soon becomes tiresome, lagu brios sole motive for all his actions from eating his breakfast to murdering a crippled beggar his revenge, but what or whom he is avenging, he's never made clear to the reader. Other characters in the novel are a mixture of fictional, legendary and real historical figures. Among the latter, Anthony Burgess, Edward G. Robinson, Emily Dickinson, L. Ron Hubbard and Veronica Lake. Bear Ponte thinks he's being clever by setting some of the scenes in a so called Scientology tent on the banks of Lake Veronica. But the effect is simply witless, and the reader will struggle not to throw the book into the fireplace. imagery. As a poet beer pod has been praised for his imagery, although I cannot think why. And the unspeakably squalid bit crumpled moment of tadeo Gabo is jam packed with all his old favorites. Crows, cows, burnt toast, pencil cases, weather systems, the blood spotted handkerchief with a to book your patient, chaffinches Hydros the horn of plenty in the garden of gift cemani mud chutes mudchute potato recipes and pastry fillings, starlings, pigs, more starlings, more pigs are nightmarish, albino hen, and the Munich air disaster are all evoked at one time or another in imagistic ways. As the princeling becomes ever further bit crumpled. Does the book have heft? Yes, it does. Structure The book is divided into 49 chapters fairly uniform in length. Each chapter ends with a reminder, as if the reader needed one that a further stage of unspeakably squalid bit krump element has taken place. Except for the last chapter to which I have already referred, bear pond is clearly fond of the practice found in the picaresque novel of summarizing the plot in his chapter headings. To take a random example, Chapter 26 is titled, in which the big crumpling of tadeo Gobbo proceed to pace as his mad uncle lagu briault unleashes a swarm of killer bees into the sports arena during a wrestling contest. And a fake eclipse of the sun leads to rioting and flux, together with some notes on the flocking of calf injuries and the nesting habits of starlings other side in which a missing punctuation mark spells Doom for an apothecary, and the reappearance of lagu brios lobster, plagiarism or quotations. certain passages in the book appear to have been copied verbatim from novels by Barbara Taylor Bradford, Elias Canetti, Dan Brown and the sociopathic act, jailbird Jeffrey Archer.

presumably considers this to be post modernist irony, a dangerous medical condition best treated by having one's brains released out with a violent purgative narrative sloppiness untold oodles of it, it is a sloppy flabby and slapdash book from first to last, as its core is a burning jewel of flummery and poppycock. brow, neither high middle nor low, not even know brow. This book brow is frantic and black. See above. bookcase location. Finding the right spot for this volume on your bookcase or bookshelf is likely to be fraught with difficulty. Dobson's invaluable pamphlet on the shelving of books, which he is sadly out of print will not help you, even if you managed to crack down a copy. For as the Titanic pamphleteer readily admit there are certain books, especially those written by twee pilot such as Dennis Pierpont, which resists proper shelving on even the most well ordered of bookcases, top left corner, no squeezed in among the driveline, tat on the bottom shelf, hardly shoved behind the collected works of Edward upward and quietly forgotten. Certainly not, because you will always remember that it's there, and it's hidden presence will reproach you every time you go anywhere near the bookcase. And you will be as the lowest worm or Beagle or that which creepeth on its belly, in the foulest mark upon the earth. maddeningly Dobson goes no further, he leaves us in the look. He refuses to say what I think he means set fire to the damn thing in your garden. Justice Anthony Burgess biographer Roger Lewis was tempted to do with a rival life of the absurd Mancunian polymath marketing ploy. Each copy of the unspeakably squatted bit Crump element of tadeo Gobbo comes with a free gift, there's a paper bag of badger food. For that reason alone, I recommend that you buy a copy at once.

Here's another quotation. This is from JD Barris foods book 19 impressions. As I searched feebly among the material transparencies that were knowing that were growing, sorry. As I searched feebly, among the material transparencies that were growing more and more evanescent. I saw a symbol of the little shabby figure from the road, staring in the window.

And he's author quiller couch from Noughts and Crosses. I see the children growing up, I see the girls droop and pine in this dreary parsonage, where the winds nip and the miasma from the cut job coax them. I see the handsome promising boy dulling to the devil slowly at first, then by strides, as their hope fades from his sister's faces, it drinks and takes the opium eating and worth. He comes home from a short absence, wrecked in body and soul. After this, there is no rest in the house. He sleeps in the room with that small persistent father of his and often there are sounds of horrible struggling with it. And the girls lie awake sick with fear listening to away is grow heavy and doll for the report of their father's pistol.

And finally, this week, his Dry Creek Fisher on piano tuning. Now, if the tuning hammer is placed upon the tuning pin, with the handle straight upward, and it is pulled backward from the tuner, just a little before it is turned to the right, the tension will be increased somewhat before the pin is turned. As this motion slight as it may seem, pulls the pin upward enough to draw the string through the upper bridge, and enough a teta Marie small distance, but enough to be perceptible to the air. Now, if the hammer were removed, the tendency of the pain would be to yield to the pull of the string. But if the pain is turned enough to take up such amount of string as was pulled through the bridge, and as it is turned, is allowed to yield downward toward the pull of the string. It will resume it balance and the string will stand at that pitch provided it has been rendered properly over the bridges. We set forth these details that you may have a thorough understanding of what is meant by setting the pins. And while it is not always advisable to follow this method, including there are some pianos that will stand more satisfactorily when created in this way. valuable advice? I think if you find yourself wanting to tune a piano in the next week, which some of you may well do. I don't know. That's been that's that's been hunting out on the air for this week. Yes, I have nothing else to say really go to visit the hooting our website, hooting odd.org while you're there, you can read vast amounts of stuff, including just posted information about an actor called park bench, which is possibly the finest name of any actor or indeed anyone in the world park bench.

And really that's it. Bye bye.
