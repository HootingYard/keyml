Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. This week I'm going to begin reading a story from 20 years ago, that has never been reissued. Since then, since 1992. All read on this show. It's a story called accidental deaths of 12. cartographers number eight, can buffer case, a couple of things to say about it. The title makes a suggestion that there are going to be another 11 accidental deaths of cartographers, but I never wrote numbers one to seven or nine to 12. This story appeared in a paperback anthology called massacre. It was the third annual issue of massacre which was published every Valentine's Day between, as I recall 1990 and 1994, edited by Roberta McCown or Roberta mock. And the issue number three from 1992 featured work by hacking by Peter Blake red, Maxim desharnais. Richard kostelanetz, Greg Lucas, and Ellis sharp and a number of other people, including me, also someone with the unlikely sounding name of Ed Baxter. Anyway, we were all in in massacre anthology three of which it was said by New Hope International, zany, surrealist, Anna kissed, I don't know, not my cup of tea. Well, I hope this is your cup of tea. This is going to be on the show for the next few weeks, I think judging by the length of it, but we'll have a little pauses here and there, where there is an asterisk in the text. So from 1992 I'm actually transcribing it exactly as it appeared 20 years ago, currently on the hooting yard website, on a daily basis. So you can read at least part of it online at the moment, and eventually the whole thing, but before then we'll get going. This is accidental deaths of 12 cartographers number eight Ken butter case. The parents of the great cartographer Ken Botha case, were employed by a small railway in a remote country. They lived in a wooden heart which served as a signal box. A threadbare curtain of rep divided the heart into two halves. In one half the batter cases ate and slept and baked and washed. The other half contained the signaling controls and was also used to store an ever changing collection of broken locomotive machinery. Once a day, at noon, or there abouts a cart will travel to the door of the heart to railway officials would deliver some broken bits and pieces and take others away. Mr. or Mrs. Butter case would sign one kit for the deliveries. Another check for the pieces removed and help the two officials, one of whom was to bug killer to load and offload the very the invariably rusty pieces of metal. their duties the left them little time to devote to their only child. Let's examine these duties in some detail. The railway itself was not busy. The one train pass the hat four times a day, heading north at 4am and 4pm and heading south at 10am and 10:15pm. Before its passing, the signals had to be set. The cranks, winches, leavers, pulleys, knobs, fulcrum and transistor motors all had to be adjusted with frightening precision. In order for this to be done, the broken locomotive parts had to be shoved out of the way into the other half of the heart. They could not be kept outside exposed to the elements, as the company regulations forbade such a practice nor could they be stored permanently on the other side of the rep curtain. As not only was this as we have seen the fabric He's living quarters. It also served as the workroom devoted to carrying out the many other tasks they had to perform, which we shall examine into course.

Once all the broken stuff had been moved out of the way, the signalling equipment could be set. readjustment back to the original coordinates took place once the train had passed, after which the day's conglomeration of broken bits and pieces could be shifted back to the other half of the heart. There was a great deal of paperwork. But the cases parents carried this out at the tiny wooden escrow while next to the oven. Every day and inventory had to be taken of the hetero clutch jumble of rubbish cluttered on the other side of the curtain. The railway provided pre printed forms to be completed for each item in the form of a questionnaire detailing such things as time of delivery to the minute, exact dimensions, percentage of surface area covered in rust, visual evidence of sabotage signs of unlawful hammering, pounding, twisting, or breakage, and so on. The forms had to be handed over to the officers on their daily visit, whether or not they removed the piece in question. multiple forms were therefore necessary if a thief remained in storage for more than 24 hours, but this was rare. Mrs. Butter case usually write the details out in rough. Then her husband copied the information onto the form in his best handwriting, which was rarely neat enough for the officers, particularly the tubercular one who lambasted Mr. bata case accordingly. There were other forms to be completed, it was necessary to count the number of passengers aboard the train each time it passed. It trundle along reasonably slowly which helped, but the windows were filthy with grease, which made it imperative to pair with great concentration. The accuracy of the fingers could always be checked by comparing the butter cases calculation with that made the neck hat along the line, although this was rarely if ever done, and it could always be argued that passengers had leaped or fallen off or jumped aboard between the signal box and the next heart. Not that this was likely, there's hardly any passengers ever used the railway anyway. The passenger count forms were collected on a monthly basis by another more important railway official who were a tall hat like a funeral directors and arrived at the heart of Strider gigantic horse, when he called the butter cases have to feed both the man and his steed with buttons and glucose syrup. other duties included buffing up ceremonial shields and brass work, making flags and pennants, procuring rainwater, cooking sausages for the company hound, sharpening the pencil sharpener, cleaning the rails, slaughtering the insects, which trespassed on the railway, keeping the paintwork up to scratch dismantling the signals on public holidays and carting huge amounts of sand and grit from one side of the track to the other. Little Ken was bitten to undertake only one task. Every day, a small amount of paraffin had to be collected from the paraffin shed, which was four hours walk away across the desert, bandit screw Moore's. He would leave mid morning, carrying a special tub on his back, supporting it with ropes crossed over his shoulders and under his arms. His parents gave him a flask of turnip soup for sustenance along the way. The bandits of that country were fierce and ruthless, but they were unforgivably careless, and had little idea of how to conduct an ambuscade. But a case was always able to spot them long before they would have been able to waylay him and he took the necessary precautions. Sometimes he hide behind a stone until they went away, or he'd wait for them to set upon a less observant traveler, perhaps a peddler or minstrel, and then dash swiftly past while they were otherwise engaged. His other alternative was to make long detours which he often did, approaching the paraffin shed by a bewildering variety of different routes. Was it this early familiarity with the highways and byways of his homeland, which stirred his first cartographic impulses?

The paraffin shed was the smallest of a cluster of buildings far from the railway itself but oh nevertheless by the company which charged pitiful rent to the tenant. Among the other buildings were a tavern, an ink factory, a menagerie, a cork shop, an igloo, a massive empty prison, and a warehouse full of bones. The paraffin shed was rented by a retired sea captain, whose name is unfortunately not recorded in later years, but a case remembered him as by turns gruff and amiable language and crusty, corrosive and vibrant, insensible and bereft. Although it may be thought that he spent long hours entertaining his small visitor with seafaring yarns, tales of exploration and derring do upon the high seas, rattling narratives of piracy and bilgewater there's no evidence that he ever did so. As far as we know, all whatever took place was that upon butter cases arrival, the boy unhitch the tub from his back, unscrewed the stopper, the sea captain poured a paltry amount of paraffin into it, demanded his money and held out his vast and hairy hand for the receipt of the coins. Were upon the land paid him, replace the stopper, hitch the refill tab onto his back, bid the old salt farewell until the morrow, and began the long trudge back towards his parents heart. Did he ever visit any of the other buildings he may have done? What would have happened had he encountered in the warehouse of bones. A slobbering giant racked with the dropsy or blundered into the Menagerie and come face to face with a starving bison or been lured into the ink factory and had his top of paraffins stolen from him by the snag to surf detailed to stand guard at the door, his mouth forever filled with sticky raspberry flavored confections, the juice of which dribbled down his chin and fell in droplets upon his outlandish pantaloons. What turn might have been taken in the life of the cartographer to be had these things happened. There is rich material here, but we must turn our backs upon it and follow the young batter case, back to the wreck divided heart, to which daily he returns, as Twilight descends upon the land, and how the herd far off in the distance, or perhaps the occasional spurt of gunfire, or a hoot from the rickety train trembling on its way, with or without passengers, with or without freight.

He was 16 years old when he was flung into prison, and 20 when he was released on a special license, having been recommended by the prison governor to accompany an Antarctic Expedition as General factotum accordionist and toothbrush maker up to the very minute the steam ship indescribable carved out of the harbor, Botha case was handcuffed to a prison guard. The two had become fast friends during the seven week journey from the prison to the small seaside town from which the expedition sailed. clump for God was a small flickering man who drew maps in his spare time. Never having set foot outside his homeland is exquisitely illuminated maps of far cafe beach, Xin Pargo Hoon and ichiko weatherpro product of a fevered imagination all too rare in men of his profession. But a case of course, was austrac he repeatedly badgered clump to make him a gift of one of his maps. But the prison guard refused for reasons we can only guess at not that we will bother. As they made their way on foot across the country for 49 days of that abominable winter camp nevertheless gave better case a far more valuable gift, a pencil. It must not be forgotten that in those days, convicted felons, even those released on license, were routinely deprived of pencils, as they were of pencils. pencil cases, pens, protractors rulers, campuses, crayons, set squares and many other items of stationery and graphic equipment. The king himself had renewed the ban. In the very year of butter cases release, Trump was taking a terrible risk. Perhaps he was in his cups when he hastily shoved the pencil into butter cases pocket. The great cartographer later recalled that the prison guard had tears in his eyes as he did so. On the deck of the indescribable clump removed the handcuffs from his young charges, puny wrist, the two embraced Dowty, explorers. Some already kitted out in their Antarctic first bustled clump off the ship. They were impatient for butter case to begin his accordion lessons. prisoner and God never saw each other again. klump came to a bad end. On his return to the prison. He had his pencils counted, and he's furious blushes confirm the governor's suspicions. dismissed from the service. He fell on evil days and died two years later, drunk out of his brain on the floor of a post office in cantara. BIM.

Well, lad, said the navigator to Botha cases, the two sat in the stifling squalor of the indescribable chart room. As you can see, I'm plotting our course on these Porto lands. It's exacting work. I am a very ancient craggy man, the sort you sometimes hear referred to as a sea dog or old salt. I have been at sea since I was much younger than you are now. First as a deckhand, then as a build boy, only in my 50s did I aspire to the position of navigator. It took 20 years of arduous study, for me to reach my present state of knowledge, where I can be entrusted single handed to take this mighty steamship across the world, issuing instructions to the louts on the bridge, to stare this way or that to correct the course by so many degrees to hold fast to portal, Star board, et cetera, et cetera. He spat into his mahogany spittoon. My training began when I became a second Deputy Assistant to the navigators made on a fine old wooden ship, the name of which escapes me. I, your memory plays some rum old tricks lad when you get to my age. Day and night I watched the chief navigator. bewildered at the subtlety of his art. I perched in a little hammock just above his left shoulder, making careful note of all he did in my notebook. I rarely slept. Eventually. It was a long, long time, I felt I had gained some semblance of understanding. Then disaster struck. At midnight on the fourth of June 18, dot dot. A storm blew up and that delicate ship was smashed asunder on some rocks. Only three of us survived. We managed to clamber into a dingey as the tempest howled around our ears. For 14 weeks. we drifted in the pitiless ocean, subsisting on Rotten biscuits pemmican and the occasional seahorse we were able to spear with our beignets. I passed the thirst, Christ days, I passed the thirst crazed days having frantic arguments with mustonen hairball by companions, who became steadily more and more enraged with me, because I kept winching about my notebook. I'd lost it in the very teeth of the storm, you see, and that's all my years of navigational study, whereas naught you can understand why are whimpered so can you not? Eventually, they grew so sick of my moaning that they held me over the side. In the middle of the night, they grabbed me muffin taking my legs and hairball my arms and they swung me overboard cackling like maniacs and I splashed into the freezing sea, helpless and alone. Luckily, I had secreted The remainder of the biscuit supply in my blazer pocket. There was no moon, I could see nothing. I tried water for hours, terrified that at any moment I would be attacked by all sorts of fiendish aquatic monsters. But none came. I managed the biscuits and moistened my parched lips with the last few dregs of my spittle. The silence was unendurable. I creaked out I croaked old hinze dredged up from memory. Sleep I knew would be fatal, even for a few seconds. Just as I was about to pass out, my luck came in an enormous crab clawed its way up onto my scalp. Were perched, tweaking my hair agonizingly in his pincers. The pain kept me awake, and I began to hallucinate. But the visions were so mundane, that I will not bore you with them. Suddenly, as dawn broke, I felt solid ground beneath my feet. peering around I saw that I had drifted onto an island. Crawling onto the strand I shoveled a few handfuls of nearby crustacea into my mouth, swallowed them, having hardly bothered to crunch them, and fell into an exhausted sleep. When I awoke, it was pouring with rain. For as long as I remained on the island, the rain never ceased. Bear that in mind, as I tell you the rest of my adventures, the old see dog took a plug of tobacco from behind his ear, and lodged it between his teeth.

The island on which I had fetched up was small but well provided for in terms of foliage and nourishment. It was the shape of a dromedary the S tank after 11 weeks, during which I was absolutely drenched by the rain. I was rescued by a passing ship, the captain of which was the most devilish kicker alive. His name was lapwing, his flesh was orange. He wore a violet hat, and his pipe smoke curled around his head, so that he was forever in a fog. his crew was so terrified of him, that they all assumed a permanent crowd on suffered agonizing back pains as a consequence. The ship's doctor, a saintly man named Bagshaw or shore bag, I forget wick hardly had a moment's rest. He was forever having to rub lineaments and ointments onto the men's backs to sue the Rictus have constructed a fascinating piece of equipment, an oak frame, almost like a rack on which four men could live at a time having their bodies stretched to counter the effect of their crouching, the doctor making incremental adjustments to a large red wheel with a special lever inserted in a hole in the rim. The dastardly Captain knew nothing of this. The treatment was always administered at night while he slept, and the machine was hidden from him during the day behind huge crates of cargo, tin bitumen custard in the darkest recesses of the hold. When I hold my soaking body aboard Captain lac with lapwing immediately set me to work as the doctor's assistant, replenishing the lineament anointment jars, and holding bag shorts or shore bags, massive fringe of hair out of his eyes as he went about his duties. I was also put in charge of the small colony of badges, which lived below deck. procuring food for them was no easy matter, but I too was terrified of lapwing, and I soon learned to entice a bowl of badger food from the least promising of ingredients. It's a skill that has not deserted me. You may have noticed a lad that I still keep a little team of badges in my cabin. Dobbin is my favorite rather frisky for his species, but a treasure nonetheless. I hate to interrupt you said butter case. But shouldn't you be paying more attention to the charts. Those of you who recall the newspaper reports of the globe expedition will be aware that Botha case never reached the Antarctic. The navigator was so inept that he took the ship not to the southern seas, but to the lemur riddled western coast of Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies.

So that was part one of accidental deaths of 12 cartographers number eight, Ken butter case, originally published in 1992, in the paperback anthology massacre, number three, an annual anthology of anti naturalistic and marginal writings. I'm not sure how many copies of this were ever published, it was published by indelible ink. But if you look on eBay, you never know you might be able to pick up a copy. Very rare, I think. And I was gonna say we're going to continue with that story next week. But of course, I will be here next week, because there's a studio closure for mopping up and redecorating and cleaning and all sorts of other hoo ha. So I'll be back in two weeks. And in two weeks time, we will continue with this very exciting story, which for the next part will be setting the Dutch East Indies. So yes, meanwhile, don't forget to go and check the hooting yard website where among other things you can read about how there was a the resonance 10th birthday party on Tuesday, just gone. I designated part of the area as a mosh pit for young persons. successfully, I think, and I think it showed that I've really got my finger on the pulse and have a an innate understanding of my audience. Anyway, yeah, go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org. And while you're there, you can always buy some books or make a donation. That's always very handy too. And, yeah, I'll be back in two weeks time so bye bye.
