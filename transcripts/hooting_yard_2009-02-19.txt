Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Last week, I read a series of interconnected stories cleverly interconnected stories. And there were so many of them that I didn't have time to finish. So I'm going to begin this week show is completing the the completing the interconnected stories. So here's the next one. It was a big fort with delightful crenellations and many flags, and it had the shiny highest portcullis outside of Nevada. This was fought hoity sr, fought fought toity, and an extremely interesting fought in its own right. But underneath fought hoity ran the parkington tunnels, those tunnels you may have come across in your reading. If that is you've been reading about tunneling systems as a change from your usual diet of chiclet gets lit and Xavi Smith lit. There is a regrettable temptation to neglect the literature of tunnels, and to be sidetracked by less meaty subject matter by ephemera and winsomeness. And by the outpourings of knaves, I'm not immune to such distractions myself. And in truth, I also have done a lot more tonally reading than I have, especially once I put my mind to writing about the parkington tunnels. There are a huge chasms in my knowledge. And if I faced a quiz on the subject, I suspect my score would be embarrassing. Perhaps not so bad as that of clueless, David Lammy. Unbelievably, the government minister for higher education, whose appearance a couple of months ago on the television show mastermind, elicited such delight, as his belief that Henry the seventh succeeded to the throne after Henry the Eighth, and that the surname of the Nobel Prize winning scientist, Pierre and Marie was Antoinette. The network was not asked any questions about tunnels, but we may safely assume he would have fluffed them. Speaking of fluff, there's a surprising amount of it in certain sections of the pakington tunnels, layers, or perhaps clouds of dust would be explicable. But it's difficult to account for the incredible fluffiness to be found underneath for quality. After all, there's not a speck of fluff in either 40 itself or in 40. And though both forts contain their fair share of dust and knots and scum, and grease stains, all fluffiness has been eradicated forever and ever. Yay, Ian onto the last trump by the installation of modern fluff obliteration technology, developed by the computer giant macro hard yet, take the staircase down from the fork at broom cupboard and enter the parkington towels. Take a left and a right and a second left, a new will be in the section of the tunnel, dubbed the fluffy zone by those in the know there are spirits and spots of fluff elsewhere in the system. But in this part, it's quite simply overwhelming. Nobody knows why. Nor does anybody know why the tunnels were dug in the first place. We know who dug them because they're named after their digger parkington The so called human mole, and we know when they were dug for every time he turned a corner or began a new stretch or created a tributary tunnel pakington stuck pins in a panel to form the numbers of the date and hammer the panel with nails to the tunnel wall head height, head height for pakington being considerably higher than for most men, for he was eerily tall. And that's all the tunnel junctions are unexpectedly cavernous, quite unlike the tunnels themselves, through which parkington himself could only move when stooped, or by crawling upon his belly like a creeping thing as mentioned in the Bible, a pocket sized edition of which in the Huckabee version he carried in his pocket wherever he went digging as a sort of charm or talent man, which he insisted protected him from tunnel collapses and subterranean mudslides. Obviously, there must have been one occasion when he went out with his spade and his jackhammer and his crate of dynamite and his pickaxe and his other tunneling paraphernalia, but forgot to tuck the Bible into his pocket. For on a very rainy Thursday pakington perished buried under a tunnel to have soaking wet soil, the weight of which proved too much for the wooden props with which we had shorted up in that tunnel he was digging that day, a brand new tunnel far away from the tunnels he had dug on default hoity, and which bear his name still and attract many a tourist and many a weekend troglodyte.

It was as a sightseer with a bent for the loveliness of crenellations that I discovered the puking term towels. I came to Fort whitey to see the fort, as did all those in my coach party. We were a gang of fought freaks. It happened that I became detached from my pals when straggling at the back of the group padding through the famed 40 corridor cupboards. I stopped to buy a carton of yogurt from the yogurt cupboard person. So delicious was the yogurt that I spooned all of it into my mouth there and then, only to find that the group had gone ahead without me and I was all alone. I blended into the broom cupboard and followed the staircase down, and that's found myself at the entrance to the tunnels. I was all struck as who would not be at the time I jumped to the rack conclusion that the tunnels lead directly underground from 40 to 4020, where I suppose a second staircase would take me up to the sister forts, majestic pantry, an architectural wonder of the pantry and larder world, if ever there was one. I did not know then, that the parkington towels were the work of a madman dug without purpose or direction or sense. I did not know then that the tunnels lead nowhere, that all the twists and turns and rises and plunges ended if they ended at all tapering ever narrower in blockages of black adamantine stone. I did not know that parkington had, in spite of the apparent chaos, designed his tunnels with a lunatic genius for precision, such that he and only he could ever find the way out. These are dark tunnels, these pakington tunnels, and I have dwelt within them since snacking on that carton of yogurt for over 100 years.

These are dark tunnels, these pakington tunnels, and I have dwelt within them since snacking on that carton of yogurt for over 100 years. That innocent little sentence the conclusion to a piece about the parkington tunnels caused a good deal of consternation among the hooting yard readership when it appeared on the hooting yard website. And it brought to the postbox a number of letters of complaint. This one from Olivia funnel is typical. Dear Mr. Key, she writes, I'm well aware that the hooting yard cannon is riddled with inconsistency in accuracies and indeed with sheer ignorance, but this time You've outdone yourself. At the end of the parkington tunnels, we learn that the narrator has been trapped in said tunnels for over a century. This makes a nonsense of much of the preceding text. Even if we take at face value, the unlikely longevity of the narrator. We're left with a number of problems, to wit. None of the genres of lit referred to chick Gittens AB Smith existed 100 years ago. So how is the narrator aware of them? How to does he or she know about David Lammy is lamentable appearance on mastermind. If the tunnels are a magnet for tourists and part time troglodytes, and one cannot escape from the system once one's entered it, surely the place must be teeming with bewildered folk. There are other stupidities in the text, but those will do to be going on with I think your devoted readership and listenership deserves clarification of these matters. Otherwise, I will not be the only one whose life will be blighted irreparably by flaxman. Yours sincerely. Oh, funnel. Ms. Well, to be honest, I wasn't I was a bit perplexed by these things myself. So I asked the narrator to address them. It was a simple enough matter to communicate with him using the awesome power of Whoo hoo, boo. Here is his reply. I'm pleased your correspondence does not take issue with my remarkable longevity. But it's still worth explaining that it's accounted for by certain properties of the air within the town. What these properties are, I cannot say, but I know I've never felt fitter in my life and that my lung capacity is that of a 15 year old. I tested it myself only yesterday with a plastic and cellophane the lung analysis kit. So that's no idle boast. We've heard queries about my knowledge of bang up to the minute popular culture. Miss funnel makes broad assumptions without pausing to think things through. Can she really imagine that there is a spot on the globe, albeit a subterranean spot that has escaped the ubiquity of Zaidi Smith lit. If anything, I would say that in the pakington tunnels, we out do much of the world in our devotion to the trendily headsculpt fote intellectuelle writer. There's a cult of zedi down here, and the totems of Jeanette Winterson have been toppled at last. And of course, we received regular consignment of chicklit and get lit to keep the troglodyte zombies out of mystery. I confess that it's unclear to me how our lit is delivered. It is I think, something to do with motors and rails and pulleys and vacuum tubes. Regarding the appearance of the numbskull, lammi on mastermind, my knowledge of that came to me in a vision of almost Blakey and intensity. Enough said, I have spoken of we and us. And it's true that I'm not alone in the tunnels that we have a thriving community here kept busy crawling on our bellies and reading lit. But there are fewer people than one might imagine, given the number of tourists and weekenders when he constructed the tunnels, the human mole place near the entrance, a bottomless Viper pit model on the one shrubbery ness, and the majority of visitors plummet down that screaming. He was a proper caution that parkington So there you have it, it's to be hoped that Olivia funnel and the other serial winches are satisfied with this compelling report from our man in the tunnels. what he has to say makes complete sense to me. And if holes remained in his narrative, then let it be a narrative with holes. Dennis Pierpont once wrote a poem with holes in it, and it proved to be his most popular work far out selling his usual tweet doggerel.

For the time being, that's the end of the interconnected stories because I haven't yet written one that begins with that final sentence about Dennis beer pints poem with holes. So this is something else entirely. There were pelicans I hungered to see those huge scooping bills gulping down fish small and large from scratch to trout. I felt an affinity with pelicans. Even though the only pelicans I had ever seen were illustrations in reference books, the A to Zed of seabirds and the life of pelicans for example. Was it because I could imagine opening my gullet and swallowing fish hole? It may have been? It's true my diet consists mostly of fish bream, and place mackerel and eels. Especially eels. I prefer to eat them whole and raw and still alive. into my more goes the eel headfirst terrified I expect but then that's the way of nature creatures feeding upon each other. If I am ever swallowed whole by some beast bigger than me, I will not complain. I will be scared stupid, but nestling within the fear of an imminent Doom will be a sense that this is the way the world works. I've never seen myself as a nibbler a mouse say a piece of cheese or a beaver gnawing upon a log. There is that in me, which is attracted by the gorging of a living, wriggling, squirming, seasalt, smeared, piss gein creature all in one go. I expect I get it from my parents, Roman Catholics who dutifully stuck to fish on Fridays and had terrible table manners. par would nip out to the fishmongers and bring home a wrapped package of something that had been swimming innocently but a couple of hours before and smear it with sauce and sprinkle it with salt and pepper and cut it up with a knife and fork and ration it out. greedy me. I always wanted the whole thing I never wanted to share. And as soon as I was grown and no longer dependent on my path or my fish, I would indulge myself from Saturday to Thursday as well as on Fridays, Haddock place and those Yummy, yummy eels. I feasted on them all. When I realized I wanted to eat them alive, I stopped going to the fish mongers and bought myself a fishing rod and headed for the river bank. I even got myself wading boots, and I cast my line in the muddy river and discovered a knack for fishing. It was as if they came to me biting my bait, offering themselves wanting to be eaten up and serve my appetite. And they did Oh, they did in their teeming thousands, even the swivel backs and the gummies and the Ling. I've never seen a pelican but when I praying before the mirror of an evening, it is a human Pelican. I see one whose stomach is stuffed with fish, a human Pelican missing that mighty bill, but otherwise just as raviolis and just as elegant.

This is an exciting adventure story called tiny Enid and the dustbin of history. One misty morning tiny Enid was reading the latest issue of her favorite comic, the Pepsi Pepsi Whoo. When in a speech bubble hovering over the head of a character called the very Reverend prebend receptor, Miss Widdecombe she came upon the word, the dustbin of history. Specifically, she learned that every now and then there were people or institutions or events that were consigned to this dustbin. Tiny Enid thought this was a very sad state of affairs. But she was not a mawkish, weepy kind of girl, so she did not sob into a napkin. A helpful footnote in the comic explained that the existence of the dustbin of history was first revealed by a bitty bespectacled Russian revolutionary who ended up with an ice pick in his head in Mexico. Such a gruesome fate did not bother tiny he made one iota for sure he could herself be ruthless as occasion demanded. She was alarmed, however, to read that the dustbin might not be a dustbin, but a mistranslation from the Russian of ash heap. If that which was consigned to, it was incinerated, she reasoned that would be beyond the salvage. For already, you see being the impactor was infant adventurous, she was tiny, Enid had decided to find the location of the dustbin of history and to rescue its content. This seemed exactly the kind of mission for a plucky youngster who had been twiddling her thumbs in idleness for an entire fortnight, without a single daring escapade to speak of casting the Ipsy Pepsi whoo aside, tiny Enid took down an atlas from the bookcase. It was such a huge Atlas that it probably weighed more than she did, but she managed to slam it down onto her lectern. the lectern was a full sized one donated to tiny Enid by a grateful Vicar who had rescued from the jaws of death in the jungle, where he had a big part in a Verner Hertzog film, and she had to saw off part of the base to make it just the right height for her diminutive stature. deciding not to worry over much about whether the dustbin was actually an ash heap. She skimmed hurriedly through the Atlas, looking for places where a pretty large dustbin or actually might be concealed. Although neither the speech bubble nor the footnote in her comic suggested that the dustbin of history was hidden away somewhere tiny Enid intuitively felt that must be the case. And she often relied on her intuition, which actually explained to those who asked her was not feminine intuition, so much as heroic clubfoot in infant intuition, a different kind of intuition entirely, and far more accurate. It was after all, after all, intuition, which led the brave taught to track down the vicar on location in the jungle with Verner Hertzog rather than say elsewhere with a director such as john Locke, Godard or guide Rick tree, pinpointing a large, flat, windy and uninhabited area on one of the continents. Timing, Enid packed her Pipi bag with supplies and room golf in her jalopy towards the aerodrome, terrifying geese and ducks and roadside mendicants as she drove pell mell along the winding country lanes. hopping into her biplane, she rode away out of the nest, and up into the immense blue firmament be goggled and be gloved and chewing on a radish. She thought it would be a good idea to contact her mysterious, unseen mentor to let him know what she was up to. We first encountered this mentor in an earlier story, where he was introduced for intricate plotting purposes without any clear idea of his identity. No need to worry about that. Now. However, for when tiny Enid reached for the pneumatic speaking funnel, she realized it was clogged with dust and pebbles. Even if you did manage to get a signal. All her mysterious mental would hear from her would be mangled, muffled meant she threw the funnel aside and revved her engines with renewed derring do. There was much turbulence during the flight, and much turbulence to inside tiny in its head. We think of her as a self possessed an unflappable heroine,

and she was but often that resolute exterior masked in a turmoil. Like any of us, tiny interview was subject to in transmits and ecstasies to sloshes of despair and cranial hullabaloo. Weirdly, rather than planning what she would do if the dustbin of history turned out, after all, to be an ash heap, and an ash heap in a flat windy area where the ashes would be blown and scattered. She was instead mulling over something else she had read in that week's Ipsy Pepsi Woo. In his weekly column, Father Ninian tweaking had set a moral conundrum. faced with the choice, which would you save from a burning tower, a half starved yet impossibly cute puppy, or the horned and cloven hooved incarnation of the devil himself. This was precisely the kind of daring rescue tiny Enid could imagine herself making one day, but she had to discount her immediate response, which was that she would cleverly extinguish the fire, carry the puppy directly to a dog hospice and return to save the devil, but bind him in chains and make him promise to mend his ways. Father twinkling made plain that there was a choice to be made between puppy and Beelzebub, and a great moral lesson to be derived from the making of it. Tiny Enid had been turning it over in her mind for a couple of days now, and it continued to busy her brain as she soared through the sky, towards where he hoped you would find the dustbin of history.

She had still not come up with an answer when she brought the biplane down onto a landing strip attached to an apricot pericarp testing station. From here, she would have to hike across the plains. But first, she stopped in it. Sorry. From here, she would have to hike across the plains. But first she stopped in at the station and asked the fruit scientist base there to give her a cup of tea. Tell me She asked in her shrill, fearless way. Am I right in thinking that about 50 miles west of here across the plains, I will find an enormous dustbin. The fruit scientist paused in his tea making fixed the plucky talked with a watery gaze and said, are now miss some say as there is and some say as they're aimed, and may I wouldn't rightly know on either way. Milk. You speak more like a bumpkin than a fruit scientist, sir shouted tiny Enid. And yes, please milk in my tea. Thank you. Even though he was irritated by the fruit scientist semi literate drivel, tiny Enid never forgot her manners. why might you be looking for a big dustbin all the ways out here then little one off the fruit scientist? Because oh man of apricot pericopes. I am resolute and intrepid, replied our heroine. And soon enough, as good as her word, tiny Enid was on her way across the plains actually thumped her way westwards. She wondered if the fruit scientist had been putting on an act in a misguided attempt to warn her off? Could the dustbin of history be a dangerous dustbin if it was tiny Enid would not be cowed. She will snap her nose at it and carry on regardless, for she was frightened of nothing. She stopped at a place that was a bit less flat and windy than the rest of the plains, and satin smoked cheroot taking from her poopy bags, the gadgeteer she had packed earlier, consulting the index, she saw that there were increased for neither ash heap nor dustbin. But under history, she found an illuminating survey of everything that happened upon the plains for the last thousand years from the Battle of the boppity heads to the Huntington near extinction of the loppet to droughts and floods and wind Enos to the establishment of the apricot pericarp testing station. It was all very interesting and tiny, Enid lodged it in her memory banks. One day she knew she would no longer be tiny and adventure would lose it to law. And she pictured herself grown old and a bit Dotty sitting in a cottage writing her memoirs and she wanted to forget nothing, for she was determined that she herself would never be dropped into the dustbin of history. And then she sat up with a start, it suddenly occurred to her that when she found the dustbin and peered down over its edge, she might lose her footing and topple into it, perhaps have a greasy rim or lethal uneven patches where it had been gnawed by wild animals. She rummaged in her Pipi bag and blasted the heavens that she had not brought a goodly length of mountaineers, rope and clambering hooks. Well, she had faced peril before, and would face peril again. stubbing out her cheroot and crushing it under her corrective boot she pressed on into the West. The sun was thinking when tiny Enid arrived at a compound surrounded by a security fence. She smiled to herself with the thought that though she may have neglected to bring mountaineers, rope and clambering hooks, she never went anywhere without her razor sharp security fence slicing shears dipping into Pipi bag to get them. She read the sign affixed to the fence. large, flat, windy, uninhabited plains municipal hygienic waste disposal chute compound, it said. Tiny Enid stamped her clubfoot and left out a shrill cry. the dustbin of history was neither a dustbin nor an Ashley but a shoot. This put an entirely new complexion on her adventure. So salvage those things that have been deemed historical irrelevancies, she would have to find where the chute terminated somewhere subterranean, and she had not bought a spade. One option, of course, was to fling herself recklessly down the chute, but that would be like toppling over the edge of the dustbin. She put the shares back in her Pipi bag and sat down to think. She wondered if the lessons to be learned from the answer. Does father tweak Ling's moral conundrum could help her now a burning

tower, a starving puppy, the devil incarnate and now at a hygienic waste disposal shoot. And at that point, I'm going to bring the story to an end because that's all we have time for this week. It's a kind of thrilling point in the story. But they say there's the motive to listen next week, because then you'll find out the end and what happens and how tiny he made deals with the large flat, windy uninhabited plains municipal hydronic waste disposal chute compound. So that's it for this week. Do visit the website. There's lots to read there. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
