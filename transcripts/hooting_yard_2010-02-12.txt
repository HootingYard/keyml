Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. cause for celebration this week. No, not the muggle Tony and great holiday I was last week. The reason for unbridled cheer is that the other day on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org I posted the thousandth the 1,000th postage since the site was rejigged at the beginning of 2007. I can't recall precisely how many posts or pages appeared in the old format to be found in the 2003 to 2006 archive, but if memory serves, that was something in the region of 950. But anyway, new format 1000 postage is a milestone to be celebrated, but how ideally you would cancel all other engagements. Go to the website, put your feet up and spend days rereading all 1000 posted G's in chronological order, making notes in your jotter, pausing occasionally to stare out of the window as you mull over a particularly arresting item, and generally wallowing in the sheer hooting yard Enos of it all. Always remember, a day devoted to Mr. Key is never a wasted day. However, I'm sensible enough to realize that most of you will have other things calling on your attention, such as feeding the hamster waiting at the bus stop smoking, genuflecting. pootling about milking the cows rummaging in the attic, taking your pills repairing the fence down by the drainage ditch tallying up the entries in your ledger doing the dishes. Spreading jam on bread clutching at straws, embarking on a perilous journey downstream by kayak, groveling and filth putting the spuds on intoning spells against the pestilence mucking about boiling your shirts describing an arc parallel to the surface dusting the mantle piece. rekindling that lost love chopping celery going for gold doing the odd bit of trepanning squeezing out sponges cutting up rough vomiting, preening polishing your schoon checking the gutters making hay while the sun shines piling also upon pallium folding your towels voting with your feet, remembering a childhood EDL splitting an atom clocking in lurking in the shrubbery gathering your wit burning an effigy being Ringo Starr toiling to no purpose making whoopee burgling the Watergate building, casting the runes mesmerizing a duck emptying the bins licking some stamps, darning a hole in your Pipi bag, crunching numbers swagging a blue bottle going rogue distributing arms to paupers, looking shifty, holding out a glimmer of hope pole vaulting caterwauling playing pin the paper to the cardboard, rinsing letters, closing the barn door glorying in crime. sticking to the point, feeling of color, pondering the ineffable. gargling, straining, wiggling, pining, flailing and lying, crumpled and woebegone and exhausted and hot in the brain. You may have to do all of these or none. But in either case, the chances are, you'll be unable to devote your every waking hour to hooting yard, even though you've yearned to do so, we'll have to come up with some other form of celebration. It's a times like these a person's thoughts turn to cake, it will have to be an enormous cake to fit 1000 candles onto it. Think of all that burning wax. I'll leave you with that thought and press on. One could of course throw a party, invite 1000 guests and have each of them commit to memory for party peace recycle the text or as the spectacle post modernist as your peer obfuscate would say, the discourse of one hooting our postage. The drawback to this otherwise fantastic scheme is that some postage is run thousands of words, whereas some occasionally have been wholly pictorial other than the title, allocating all 1000 to the satisfaction of every single guest is a topic fraught with difficulty, and is unlikely to be achieved without conflict and indeed, fistfights.

Now, incidents of physical violence are not unknown among the readership, even the surprisingly numerous hooting yard devotees of the Mennonite faith engage in punch ups from time to time. Don't even go there as the Airheads say. Taken All in all, I'm not sure that party is such a good idea. Anyway, where would you fit so many people they not all fit into your chalet or hollow well appointed yet curiously pokey high rise urban living pod, and rental fees for bombs and disused airplane hangars have gone through the roof, according to what I've been reading in, so you want to rent a barn or a disused airplane hangar to you chum magazine. It's interesting to note, by the way that the late Harold Pinto was on the editorial Advisory Board of this threatening sinister publication. Cake burning wax and party all proving prohibitive. What are we to do? Well, in Extremis, one can always turn to Mrs. gubbins for some trade ideas. For once in her life, the octogenarian Crone is not helping police with their inquiries. In spite of that dodgy business with the pile of mysteriously bleached bones and the train vulture and trees to be found snugly ensconced in an attic room at haemoglobin towers, furiously unraveling tea cozies where once she did knit, now, she unravels by Heck, there'll be a glut in the used wall markets by the time she's done. It's possible this is part of yet another criminal scheme. But if so, it's one that's far too complicated for my puny and innocent brain. Best to ask no questions and leave lag gubbins to her unraveling. I popped my head into her sanctum though, just to ask if she had any bright ideas for hooting yd thousands of posts celebration. She looked up fixed me with that unnerving gaze like a blind person looking at a ghost and pronounced the single word. Norby century went back to her unraveling. It was difficult to know what to make of this. The only Nobby that springs to mind was Nobby Stiles, the popular manchester united and England midfielder of the 1960s is draw us capering on the picture after England host hoisted the remade trophy in 1966 had captured the imagination of the press in those more seemly times. So perhaps that was what Mrs. gubbins was recommending, draw us capering on a field of grass. or was she suggesting that I should enlist Nobby Stiles to help with planning a celebration? It seemed unlikely, though not of course impossible, that the retired footballer was a hooting yard fan. But even if he was, I didn't know him had never even collected his autograph when I was taught, and had no idea how to get in touch with him. I entertained the thought that perhaps the crona said Nabil with a K, meaning that which is characterized by having knobs or the quality of knob Enos, such as, for example, a gnarled tree trunk, or the backs of certain kinds of Toad, but that seemed even more unfathomable, like gubbins being the kind of woman she is, it is likely that her pronouncement was a sweeping one, containing all possible meanings of Nabil with and without a K, plus additional meanings, thus far unrevealed, the common timber of humanity. But I'm afraid I had to dismiss as wildly impractical. The idea of getting Nabil styles and perhaps some other lesser known Nabis to assist me in arranging a celebrator a caper of people and toads round and round a tree in a field, much as it was appealing.

It was back to square one. And as we all know, deep in our hearts the question always to be asked at square one is, what would Dobson do? The beauty of the question is that if we're able to arrive at a halfway sensible answer, we know the guidance given will be infallible. Working out a valid daab sonian response, however, is to blunder along a path strewn with nettles and certaines. Unless of course, one is satisfied with the generic answer. Write a pamphlet, which is admittedly correct 99 times out of 100. Even in the present case, I can think of few methods of celebration More opposite than that every one of my readers and listeners should, should sit down at their nearest esque wristwatch and pen or pamphlet. But think of the logistics. Someone would have to collate all the screens, typeset them, print them and distribute them to an uncaring world. I try my best to retain an attitude of breezy optimism, but I can't see it happening. And I haven't seen any Vantage driving past recently announcing from the lettering on their sides that they're in the business of pamphleteering solutions. But write a pamphlet is not invariably the answer to the question. What would Dobson do? Very, very occasionally, by deep analysis, exercising the brain pans to their fullest extent and beyond a different answer is revealed. To find out what this is we need to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the complete Dobson Canon and have pieced together as much biographical information on the out of print pamphleteer as we can, not excluding rumor, hearsay, tavern, mutterings and wild surmise. That's why I put the questions are Allah wishes nesting bird who knows more about Dobson than anyone else alive? As it happened? nesting bird is only barely alive following a calamitous bobsled accident. Quite what a frail 92 year old was doing, plunging down the Kasbah bad rotted Memorial perilous ice declivity at the pointy town Antarctica Rama is a question for the bigwigs, the Federation International, the Bob's late tobogganing, who I understand have already impaneled a board of geriatric investigation to be headed by the fiercely independent because ignorant to bobsleighing matters in general, and, or it might be Dec the taller of the pair, the one with the glassy eyes of death. Anyway, I bluffed my way into the clinic where nesting bird languages using the techniques prescribed by botsman in his methods of dissimulation to be employed when entering restricted medical facilities, second series, an invaluable work which I always carry with me, just in case. nesting bird was almost invisible, but he's a panoply of tubes and wires and monitors and bleepers and what have you, but I've ripped them out of my way and put my mouth to his still bloody gourd ear and put to him in adults it to whisper the question. I want to arrange a celebration for the thousandth hooting yard posted what would Dobson do? nesting bird groaned, and some sort of despicable fluid bubbled out between his bloody lips, but he managed to tell me the answer or be it in a croak so weak I barely heard it. But here it I did. He said Nabi returning home via the funicular railway I racked my brains to see if I could ring any sense from this. Put in my position it appeared Dobson would do not be or I suppose do a Nabi, as if that made any difference. Neither was a phrase I'd ever heard before. And nor had any of my fellow passengers who might badgered about it growing I'm ashamed to say rather hysterical to the port more or bundled off the train as soon as it reached the base station and taken around the corner. Past snow covered shrubbery and handed over to detective Captain kargh pan on his tough. It's lucky for me that kargh pan is a fanatical devotee of hooting Yod otherwise I feel certain I would have ended up back in the clinic and in a much worse state than Allah wishes nesting bird. Instead, the Dowty copper let me off with a mapping of my tremendous Buffon. He didn't know what doing Nabil was either.

I have the sinking feeling that if I sought advice from anybody else from BORN AGAIN beatnik poet Dennis beer pipe, for example, or from old farmer frack, I would get the same response. When I eventually arrived home, I made a cup of tea and heated a couple of smokers pop tarts. Perhaps the celebration would have to wait upon the 2,000th postage, or perhaps I should be grateful for my simple snack. I sat down at the table, slurp to the tea and shoveled down the bitter pop tarts. Was this after all, doing a knobby

I received a great piece of correspondence today. It didn't come by email. It came in the old fashioned form of a letter. Beautifully handwritten, perfect, lovely handwriting. Lovely letterhead from a hooting ARD listener. And to play the role of this listener. I've got my son Sam, who's going to read the letter for us.

Unknown Speaker  15:39
Dear Mr. K, in a recent broadcast, you confess to a degree of uncertainty. How to say the word better off. I found this a little surprising in a man of your evident erudition, but I'm happy to assure you those universally pronounced but you're sincerely, Alan bricknell.

Frank Key  15:57
I'd like to thank Sam for reading that and Alan brignole for sending it to me. He also enclosed a couple of cards which are very interesting. And yes, so there we go. There we go. I do not know how to pronounce behemoth or behemoth. One man who possibly did was who are gay Louis boys. In 1946, Borchers was appointed as poultry inspector for the Buenos Aires municipal market, he resigned immediately. Thus, it was someone called Jay W. Gwynn, rather than Borchers, who went on to write experiences of a pulp free literature collector. But Bouygues tenure as a blind inspector of poultry, while brief was not without precedent. We recalled the case of pimp T two decades earlier and far, far from when Azeris it may be an exaggeration to dump him as did pebble head in the title of his best selling paperback biography, the illustrious pimpy but that there was a luster about him cannot be denied, unless you want to start a punk shop. pmts blindness was more blankety than Miltonic. It was the sort of man who enraged cows when he trespassed in their fields that weekend, carrying a picnic basket under a thunderous sky. escaping the poultry market with its tin roofs and yelling merchants is prison in the week, the inspectors had the Braille calendar hanging tattered from a nail and the nail rusted, pricking him if he wasn't careful blood on his fingers, as his hands fumble delving into her hands croup, prodding, inspecting, as he was paid to do, and more than generously, he got a fair whack and he spent it on booze and floozies, they haunted the poultry market. Like figures from an early Kitchener Gordy Angular themselves sozzled on bathtub gin, sometimes like clucked just like the hens, particularly in the early afternoon, poor pimpy fuddled, but up to his duty tape measure around his neck like a tailor shifting schmatta God knows why it wasn't his job to measure the hens nor their eggs. They joked he thought it was some kind of a loose cravat, as if being blind he wouldn't know. They should have learned from their failed tricks those mischievous poulterers shoving a ball of dough stuck with feathers on the inspectors table. his rage was as terrible as the cows when he opened the gate of the field with one hand holding tight to the picnic basket with the other out in the midst oblivious, oblivious of it, but not of the cows that bore down on him on Saturdays and Sundays when the poultry market was closed, shuttered a deserted patch of concrete and cement. stray feathers scattered, neglected by the janitors broom, the janitor, pimped his pal some set his half brother, Deaf as a post where the inspector was blind. They made quite a pair even without the blood tie. Always playing card games at lunchtime Romijn spite and my ladies bonnet and creases no money ever changing hands the table rickety sawdust everywhere the stove in the corner rain on the roof, birds packing grain from the floor shadow in the hot door of the inspector of inspectors a looming come for the rent and a checkup pimpy defined spitting out his word hair standing on end as if he'd seen a ghost. Half these hands are sick man. What do you expect me to do? Have a ton of gin while italie my ledges I have to go and have a word with a man about a buff Orpington and a duck hook bill and off pimped he goes we Across the familiar yard sniffing the air, a storm brewing, better put on his Southwestern yellow was a duck in a nursery book shiny cardboard pages stiff buckle here and there as you'd expect. He remembered gazing and gazing wrapped when still so tiny with eyes that worked before the operation, the surgeon cutting the useless with nerves and then the blur black the new life the hard study the poultry inspection board such an easy examination. What's this? What's that? This is this and that is that sir, and a badge for merit. He still wears it polishes bust it daily after breakfast, kippers or bloaters. Schoenberg, Cosette, transfigured night, day two things PMT day two,

transfigured and transformed weekday poultry market and weekend picnic. When he gets out, humming as he approaches the gate in the field, beyond which angry cows are waiting, and he pacifies them sweet nothings try the same thing on their hands and they'd be mayhem. That much he discovered one awful Thursday. It was raining then too, and he slipped on straw or grease and gashed his leg. You won't find a better tourniquet on a tape measure. Believe you me Still, there was much blood spilled before it was taught. Pym T's Gore, like a rare expensive wine, metallic bouquet, and something in it irresistible to ducks. Dozens of them falling upon it like starlings splashing about in his blood. The inspector deafened by clucking, thinking, I better find out exactly what it is that's in my veins. I might be a miracle of medical science, who'd have thought hands maddened by the blood spatter ducks, shrieking tangled, adding the sirens from the emergency services and you have complete havoc, but pin it back at the poultry market next morning. Behind this table, sticking his fingers up a duck's fundament the sense of touch honoring even through the rubber glove bright yellow like the rain hat, like the ducks in the nursery book so much yellow. It was Pierre Boehner, Who said you could never have enough yellow no more yellow for pimpy but the yellow in his brain remembered yellow bright enough when he strains the sign up since you can almost hear them. You can almost hear them ping and Tang if you listen carefully, and pimpy does he's all ears. That's why he hears the enraged cows in the field even before they're enraged before his thumb clicks open the gate on picnic days in sunshine or mist or once when his watch stopped in the middle of the night high wind capital in slumber owls hooting pimpy with his rag and hamper jam sandwiches. Fish paste Coco a drowned beetle in the flask. The janitor never joined in grab the janitor. He goes instead on organized picnics for the hard of hearing to the grounds of castles and stately homes, not cow strewn field, always in daylight like pimped he doesn't see and hasn't seen for years, but he senses it on his eternally closed lids heat and cold, damp and haze. He no longer bothers with the sunglasses to use to sport frames too heavy on the nose. He smashed them under foot in a temper drunk to hell at the time swigging as he smashed at the poultry market but off duty on a Tuesday afternoon with a floozy on his arm. giggling egging him on a bit batty. If truth be told, or Dottie, that's the word fond of the poultry too fond may be in an unseemly way, kept trying to abduct a hen or a duck or a goose. Take it home as a pet. Oh, go on. pimpy no one will miss it. I can call it Flopsy or Clyde nestra. And like a pond for it in my bathtub, feed it grain or whatever it eats. Another grain supplier, a man with a silo Oh, pretty please. But for all he was drawn to a grandiose debauch pimped he was as conscientious or poultry inspector as the market ever had. And he foiled her kidnaps every one of them using his luster really quite mysterious, but absolutely effective. Going by results. The inspector of inspectors always had a good word for him back at headquarters, that man PIMS he is a bloody Marvel never a day goes by with his poultry inspections on a master class in the art, even when he sozzled there's a luster about him that makes my jaw drop, pimped. He never heard any of this. They never invited him to HQ, not even to the cocktail parties, a stuffy bunch and him shall we say difficult, haphazard in certain settings, liable to break things, drugs, plates, toasters, it was a devil with toasters. Rarely invited anywhere hence so lonely picnics pimpy in a field beneath the enormous sky collocating angry cows sprawled on his rug away from the poultry. Maybe that was when he worked at his luster. It was it he admitted res No. A sheen on earthly when he chose to switch it on, which he certainly did when pebble head came calling he'd heard rumors, bustle into the poultry market first thing Monday morning in Cape and spat entourage a bodyguard. So where's this blind inspector I've been hearing about Tell me dammit I have a paperback to write. Ah, good day to you, sir.

Frank Key  25:39
Gosh, pebble had dumbstruck slumps in a chair and assistant takes notes, pimply all the while inspecting geese and hens and ducks, even a swan mute. He doubles up on rubber gloves, uses some sort of beam strange miniature torch works. It's controlled so so definitely, but the swan is dead. They prosecute the merchant huge pile of legal papers, even bigger pile of Braille for pimpy. big thick sheets, untold thousands of dots. He knows the whole thing backwards, fantastic witness visits the swan killer in prison, dank sell, no smoking, repent, repent, but we can never have you back at the poultry market. You crossed the line and I drew that line. Yes. And it's indelible. Like all my lines, wherever I draw them, he babbling pimpy making up as he goes along to strike the fear of God into the convict before he shipped away over the sea to a penal colony. One specially built for bird killers, Rocky and remote blasted by gales, screeching goals, orcs, guillemots, Sky, cold and gray and hopeless place of penitence. prising barnacles from stone for food, all in parentheses mind vengeful, eaten away with hatred, teeming visions to hand in the brain. Oh, yes, lustrous pebble head saw that, but he had no idea of pimpy in the round, the whole man, duck Messiah, goose God. It's certainly worth reading the whole biography seemed to be a film. But much of what pebble had writes is nonsense. For one thing, PMT looked absolutely nothing like Anthony Burgess.

And that's the end of hooting yard for this week, sorry that I started coughing, choking and generally being unprofessional during the reading of that piece, but that was a long sentence. You can read it yourself on the hooting yachad website. And if everyone who downloads this podcast sent me a pound, I'd be a wreck, man. I'm not kidding. So send me a pound or $1 if you've listened to the podcast, bye bye
