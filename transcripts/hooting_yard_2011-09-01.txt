Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. Dr. Franklin first showed that lightning is the same as the electricity made by the electrical machine. As the electricity of the electrical machine is got by rubbing glass, so much of the electricity of the air is caused by the rubbing of moist air against dry air. A great deal is made by the turning into vapor of mist of the salt water of the ocean by the sun's heat or the blowing of the wind. More water is turned into vapor during the heat of summer and autumn than in winter. And this is why there is more lightning in warm than in cold weather. There is always a good deal of electricity in the air, and in clear weather, it is generally positive electricity, but during fogs rains or snows, it is usually negative electricity, though it changes often. It sometimes happens that two clouds, one charged with positive electricity and the other with negative electricity come near each other. And then the two kinds of electricity rush together. When a flash of lightning is seen and thunder is heard. The Lightning is the same thing as a spark from an electrical machine. The only difference being that a flash of lightning is sometimes several miles long, and the spark only a few inches. The little spark gives out only a snapping sound. But if we were able to make a spark as large as a flash of lightning, it would cause as much noise as Thunder when a cloud filled with one kind of electricity comes near the earth. While the earth is filled with electricity of the opposite kind. The cloud may discharge its electricity to the earth. If any tall object such as a tree, a steeple, or a house happens to be near where the cloud discharges, the electricity will often passed down to the earth. In this way, houses are sometimes injured and set on fire and great trees are split up into small pieces. Sometimes to human beings and animals are struck and killed. It is not safe therefore, to stand under a tree or close to a high house during a thunderstorm. We see lightning in several different forms. Sometimes it flashes straight. Sometimes it is forked or zigzag sometimes it is round like a ball and sometimes it spreads over the clouds like a sheet of fire. When a thundercloud is near the earth, the flash comes straight down to the earth because there is little air for it to pass through. But when the cloud is at a considerable distance from the earth, the air in the path of the lightning is made denser or thicker, by being pushed together. And as lightning can pass quicker through thin and through thick air. It flies from side to side so as to pass where it is thinnest. Thus, its path is zigzag or forked. When there is a very great charge of electricity in a cloud, it sometimes forces its way through the air in the shape of a ball. What is called sheet lightning is either the reflection or shine on clouds of a stroke of zigzag lightning which is too far off to be seen or light discharges of electricity from clouds which have not enough to cause zigzag lightning.

When lightning passes through air, it leaves behind it a vacuum that is an empty place and the air rushing in to fill it makes the noise which is called thunder. Ooh common in Finnish. We do not usually hear this until sometime after the flash of lightning because Light travels more than a million times faster than sound. When the sun the cloud is at a distance, the sound comes to us Little by little, and it is then called Rolling Thunder. But when the cloud is near the earth, the sound comes in one great crash. We can generally tell how far off a thundercloud is by noting how much time elapses between the flash of lightning and the sound of the thunder. If we can count five, as slowly as the tick of a clock between the two, it is certain that the cloud is more than a mile away. Lightning in its way to the earth will always follow the best conductor. And when it strikes a building or a tree, it will leap from side to side to find it. It likes pointed things better than round or blank things. And this is why lightning rods have sharp points. Buildings properly fitted with lightning rods are safe from being struck by lightning, because the rods lead off the electricity into the earth. When a cloud filled with electricity comes over the rods, the electricity will flow silently down them until the cloud is discharged. And we see no flash and hear no thunder, but we feel sure that the building will not be struck. the tops of lightning rods are usually made of silver, or gilded, so that they may not rust and thus become worthless. The lower end of the rod must be carried down into damp Earth. If the earth is dry, it is better to carry the end into a well because drier Earth is not as good a conductor as moist earth and the lightning might leap from the rod at the lower end and go into the cellar of the building. High chimneys should have rods on them because the suit in them is a good conductor, as is also the vapor which rises from them when fires are burning. The word lightning and finishes Salama. A flash of lightning is Salam and livadas

I'm at my beauties was trapped to five of obsequies for last talc struck by lightning a story from the last century 17 years ago In fact, and this is chapter six the seven members of the electromagnetic operators museum committee had written a stinking letter to last talc. Over 14 pages of officially stamped notepaper. The segment crews poured scorn on town ticket to design called into question his ability to do the job as well as a half trained ape suggested he had cajoled child into commissioning him for the work through bribery, questioned his worth as a human being and demanded that he repay valid on mass fee and with interest the monies he had been forwarded as an advance the words inept, vain, dismal, loose, incompetent, corrupt, and abominable record with less regard for the felicities of style than with a determination to hammer home a point. Mini kept the letter hidden from town for some days. He was so pleased with his prize, which he formed over while cradling it in his wrinkled hands, that she was reluctant to disturb his ideal. On the Thursday following the lightning bolt, however, town answered a wrapping the door to find Chod standing before him. Since last the committee's creature had visited town temper had improved. Indeed, Chod was taken aback by his reception as talc ushered him into the sitting room and shoved a brimming tumbler of candy can mount gavina into his hand? Sorry Cata Jan ma jobina Welcome trolled, yelled talc with ridiculous bonamy Welcome Indeed, I have something very intriguing to show you a prize I won from the scientific or medical club. Wait there while I fetch it and help yourself to the booze. I won't be a minute. Talk was about to sweep dramatically from the room, but Chod halted him. Wait, he shouted. We have more important matters to discuss than your foodlink Prize. This is not a social visit. The committee has sent me to collect it the monies with the application of rigor, if necessary. rigor I have adjutants there waiting outside, adjutant brutes armed with thumping implements. Manny's crisp finished banknotes which are handed to you in a buff colored envelope not two months ago, your advance. Mini, who was lurking in the corner of the sitting room, took the letter from her reticule and handed it to talc, who read through all 14 pages while charged drained and refilled his tumbler. Please wait a moment said talc when it last he had finished reading. He returned a few minutes later, clutching his songbook and bid mini accompany him at the piano. It has long been his habit when his nerves were frayed and his feelings convulsive to sing one of his many self composed pieces. years before he had had published at his own expense, a compendium of 114 of his songs, madrigals trance, sea shanties leader, serenade, cantatas, hymns, ballads, recitative, and lullabies. The book also included the libretto of his operetta based on the one's popular novel, a woman's spurned by Ella snow fury. One of the lasting regrets of touts life was that this astonishing work had never been performed in public, although of course, it has become a staple of the Finnish repertoire since his death. Number 49. Many, he announced many who knew all the pieces by heart and had no need of sheet music splayed her fingers over the keyboard.

Frank Key  12:43
A few words of explanation before we begin, said talc, glaring at Chod, who had retreated to the sideboard and was again refilling his tumbler. Song number 49 is entitled A Vita on the rug said talc. The instruction to the accompanist is to play fractious Lee, there are some difficult passages and the interplay between voice and piano is at times dissonant. The rules of harmony are not only broken. In this song, they're swept away in a revolutionary manner, which to my knowledge has never been accomplished by any other composer. Now sit down and pin back your nasty little fat purple is with a mighty crack on the keys many began. She played for three minutes before talc joined her rasping out the lyric in guttural croaks. Although some of his song texts are simple and straightforward, talc often favored lyrics constructed in a highly wrought language rich and elusive. peppered with wordplay, shamelessly allowing him to display his superlative mastery of intricate verse forms. This has caused these translators much grief pond, who first attempted an English translation of the songbook struggled for years before cutting his throat in a pit of despair. Shin cramp and WOD working in partnership got halfway through the book before the former discovered that the latter knew no finish. They had already published some of their translations in the Journal of winter marks studied when waters deceit was revealed, and their work was examined by scholars have merciless acuity. The pair became a laughingstock. While true and expected to be rumbled sooner or later reacted with aplomb, and turned his hand to petty theft lurking in elite alleyways near the docks. For Shin cramp. However, the humiliation was too much to bear and like pond, he perished by his own hand, hanging himself from the rafters of a log cabin in the wild Canadian wastes From time to time, other scribblers have taken up the challenge of rendering touts songbook into English. But it's fair to say that the immense textual problems have to date defied truly inspired or even competent solutions. The best we can do is to use birkholz edition, which gives literal prose translations. Her version of a viper on the rug goes as follows. In my rooms of state in which I pronounce garbed in hideous robes, there lies a rug. It is tattled. On Monday, after I had been fed slops I stole into my rooms of state pins, tax nails. Where is my warming Pan? There is a viper on the rug and my arms dangle limply the planet spin Bring me the nails. The text is repeated twice as performed by talc and Minnie. The song lasted for 20 minutes, during which time Chod finished off the bottle of Cata janma jobina and opened another one which he found in the cabinet. He was quarter of the way through this second bottle when the song clattered to an end. talc wheezing and many bashing the piano keys with terrible fractiousness. Chod slurped from his tumbler. Now get out of my sight Thunderbirds talc hurling his songbook across the room. You wish me to call my adjutants asked trod path. So be it Chod who could drink anyone under the table, walked steadily to the door, opened it and called to his brute. There were 14 of them, but they entered in a whirling tangle is one massive teaming violence. trot pointed to talc. set upon this man, he said do not stint in your thumping. Before the Andersons got an inch closer to their prey, many unleashed upon them a powerful spray of EEG from a canister which we had concealed inside the piano stall. As the jet of foam hit them.

Frank Key  17:32
Each sag in turn was completely immobilized, as if turned to stone within seconds wisps of turquoise vapor coal about their heads and their skins took on an incandescent Sheen, trolled troupe of hired muscle was transformed into a ghastly Tableau motionless and gleaming. Thank you mini said talc taking the canister from her. Rest assured Chod that your little gang will suffer no lasting damage is potent, certainly, but not fatal. Oh, and the vapor gives off a disgusting Pong after a while you'll only have to tolerate it for a week or two. Now, while many summons a removal truck, perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me in parceling up your thugs. There is a huge roll of greaseproof paper in the pantry.

So as I said that, that was chapter six of struck by lightning. It's a text that has never reappeared, since it was published as a pamphlet in an edition of 25 copies in 1994. And although there may be plans to reprint it as an out of print pamphlet, reprinted number two, maybe around Christmas time, so think what a great Christmas present it will make. You'll be able to find details of that on the hooting yard website. You know where that is. So you can always go there and have a look. Here's chapter seven. You will be wanting to know what prize town had found at the end of buchs treasure trail. It was a miniscule horn or task which according to the handwritten leaflet in which it was enwrapped held certain talismanic properties. It was a little bigger than the nail of touts little finger and was Burnt Sienna in color. horn is different from bone. It's composed of coagulated or thickened albumin, gelatine, and phosphate have a line. It contains just enough of the lime to make it hard without being too brittle and just enough of gelatin to render it easily cut a molded when heated. Most horns have a bony core, which is got out by soaking them in water for five or six weeks. This call can be ground up and made into little crucibles called Koopa shells, used for melting gold and silver in the tips of the horns which are solid, and then sawn off to be used for knife handles, buttons etc. The remainder or hollow part is easily softened by soaking it in boiling duck pond water for half an hour. When it is slit open with a knife spread out flat and pressed between monstrous iron plates. If the flats as they're called, are pressed very hard, they can easily be separated into several thin plates, which are scraped and smooth and sometimes put into lanterns instead of glass. In olden times, horn plates were used for window glass is a manufacturer of combs and other things, horn is pressed but little as too much pressure causes the teeth to split. It is easily colored, so as to look like tortoise shell, from which sometimes it can be scarcely distinguished. Horn when heated, maybe molded into almost any shape, which will keep when cold in making knife and fork handles, buttons and other small things. The pieces are cut of the right size, soft and in hot water and then screwed up in mold, which shaped the horn and press upon it any letters or figures that may be on the inside of the mouth. In about 20 minutes, the horn is taken out and is then ready to be polished, which is done with rotten stone and oil. Laugh tax prize horn however, had been subjected to no such manufactory impulses and buchs leaflet warned that it must remain whole and pristine or it would no longer serve as a talisman. The various lights under which a horn may be looked at have given rise to a vast number of words in language and not just finish. Horn may be regarded as a projection, a climax, a badge of strength, power or vigor. A tapering body, a spiral, a wavy object, a bow, a vessel to hold with all or to drink from a smooth, hard material not brittle, stony, metallic or wooden. Something sprouting up something to thrust or push with a sign of honor or pride and so on. From the shape we find words such as kernel and granum, grain and corn, from the curve of a horn,

Frank Key  23:33
Corona and crown from the spiral chromis, meaning ringlets or locks. From its being the highest point comes our crown perhaps in the sense of the top of the head. For its sprouting up and growing. We have Karin cornue cresco Grandis grass great Groot, for its curving Kurvers is probably from the root horn in one of its forms corvis core next and crow perhaps also Raven, which may have been Craven bearer, striking resemblance, corner and Kurvers. So also crane Heron and Hearn why these birds should derive their names from horn we cannot presume to say the tree Cornell is said to derive its name from the hard horn like nature of its wood and the corns of the foot perhaps for the same reason. corner is so called from its shape, possibly, although unlikely grin may mean to curve up the ends of the mouth like horns. In Switzerland, they call a mountain horn earner is a horn like crag. And what are we to make of Hoon Savi Toby and Tonto Savi are finished words for horn. Pigs leaflet Excuse me. buchs leaflet did not describe in any detail how the tiny Burnt Sienna horn acted as a talisman. In any case, all forms of superstition were anathema to talc, who would devoted one of his more uproarious essays to the subject. And yet, he was inordinately pleased with his prize, and carried it with him where he roamed during the final two weeks of his life.

So that was chapters five, six and seven of obsequies for last town struck by lightning, and we shall continue onward next week. This is gonna take a long time, but I hope you're enjoying it. I'm kind of enjoying rereading it and I think it gets better as it goes along. That's just my personal view. And I mentioned the hooting our website, which I'm sure you all know, hooting yd.org. And I ought to mention that I often babble on incessantly about the fact that you can send the money or buy books, and so on, but now there's something else you can buy. And it's very cheap. But you can actually buy a hooting yard lapel accoutrement, sometimes called a badge, a little 25 millimeter across badge, and it has the the implausible symbol with the unidentified bird like being, which appears at the top of the top of the website. So I do think it would be a very good idea to get yourself one of those badges one note 2345. Even if you go to the website down the sidebar, on the right hand side, you'll see a picture of the badge bigger than the actual actual size badge. If you click on that, it will take you to full details of how to make your purchase. And so I look forward to receiving all three or four orders in the post. Or perhaps thousands who knows. Anyway, we'll be back with obsequies for last talk struck by lightning. A story from the 20th century. Next week here on resonance 104 point four FM. That's all for me for this week. Bye bye
