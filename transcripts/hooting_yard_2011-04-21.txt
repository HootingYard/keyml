Unknown Speaker  00:14
Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. And this is hooting yard on the air with me pansy cradle to as I've done nearly every week for the past seven years I shall be reading to you for about half an hour. Some of you may not have had your radios to Newton properly and thought you were listening to someone called Frank key all this time. But no, it has been me the first piece I'd like to read this called oh wait a minute. Uh, someone from residence has just come into the studio accompanied by a couple of orderlies from the same cloth guard Mercy Home for domains to yet oddly charming distress gentle women. I shall have to go.

Frank Key  01:05
I'm sorry about that. That minor kerfuffle most unfortunate This is Frankie you haven't had your radios tuned in wrongly for the last seven years. Seven the seven year anniversary of the show was last week and those of you who were listening last week will have heard the first ever hooting out on the air rebroadcast. What a what a raggle taggle shabby piece of work. It was I must admit, I sat at home listening to it and thought it sounded appalling. But never mind. That was my fault rather than the the engineer. But I didn't have music in between songs. So then I sort of spent half the show shuffling bits of paper and muttering perhaps we should go back to that. shambolic approach. However, anyway, last week to celebrate the anniversary, I wrote a poem, and I'm going to read it to you now. twice on this day, in the year 2004. Mr. Key came on knocking at a filthy black door. The door was in Denmark Street of the Charing Cross Road, where their Sex Pistols were Hurst and punk rock did explode. But now behind the door was a radio station, by far the finest in the entire nation. For this was the home of resonance FM, a radio phonic treasure, a jewel, a gem, as Mr. Key did upon the black door knock. The time was approaching four o'clock. A buzzer buzzed, and then he stepped into a hallway that had never been swept, then through to a back room where laptops did harm. Mr. Key, said a fellow Thank God you have come. He was tall and bearded was this man, the then station manager, Knute Alpha Man. in a corner, a bucket called leaks from the ceiling, and upon the walls, the paint was peeling. It was a squalid place for sure. resonances not base there anymore. I'm here to broadcast my first ever radio show, said Mr. Key said commute. Yes, I know. You must. clamber up that narrow stare. And when you get to the top, please be aware. The floor above is close to collapse. It will last another year or two perhaps. So up the stairs climbed Mr. Key where he met a man called Maliki. Hello. He said, I'm your sound engineer. My job is to ensure that the audience can hear the sensible prose you're going to spout as our transmitter beams it out to all four corners of the planetary sphere. It's nearly time so sit down here. He proffered a chair that was falling to bits. But Mr. Key satin gathered his wit. He cleared his throat and tested the microphone. And he started to speak in mellifluous baritone. This is hooting yard on the air. He said, Indeed it was and those seven words lead to seven whole years of hooting yard shows to hours and hours of lopsided prose for the moral instruction of a grateful nation on the world's most astonishing radio station. And the shows are not lost in the dust of the past. Hundreds can be heard in the form of podcast yet towards babble of the future when he knocked on that door on the 14th of april two

Frank Key  05:26
It's rare in this day and age to hear a giant roar the words fee fi fo farm in a booming baritone likely to give one the collywobbles. So it came with something of this. This is the resonance live experience. And I've just completely messed up the beginning of that piece. I'm going to begin it all over again. It is rare in this day and age to hear a giant roar the words fee fi fo farm in a booming baritone likely to give one the collywobbles so it came as something of a surprise when the other morning walking towards the viaduct past the duck pond, I heard precisely those words, if we can call them words and turning to my left so emerging from the spinny, lumbering towards me a giant I had business at the viaduct business which need not concern you. And I was not best pleased to be delayed upon my important business by a giant booming nonsense Acme. Before I had time to frame a rejoinder, however, the giant repeated it fee fi for farm and added my eyes smelled your blood. If that was to be the extent of the giant interest in me, I judged it best to satisfy the request and hurry on my way to the viaduct. So I unbuttoned my coat and I unbuttoned my cardigan, and I unbuttoned my shirt, and I bared my torso and detached from it one of my leeches here, I said, handing it to the giant sniff this and if you cannot separate the smell of my blood from the smell of the leech, just give it a squeeze. The giant drawed fee fi fo farm again for no apparent purpose, took the leak and held it up to it mighty knows. When I've told this tale before over the last couple of days, people or people have expressed surprise that I should be sashaying about the place with leeches affixed to my torso. I don't see why they should raise eyebrows. My blood is important to me. There's a reason we sometimes call it our lifeblood. My life depends upon it as it courses through my veins circulating in the manner discovered by Dr. Harvey 1578 to 1657 pumping, pumping, and thus I wish it to be as pure as possible. What better way than to have it sucked by leeches? All too often nowadays we poo poo Mehdi evil physician physicians, but they knew what they were about in the matter of leeches if in no other field. My usual practice is to have five leeches sucking at a time whimsically. I like to call four of them. JOHN, Paul, George and Ringo. never quite able to decide whether the fifth leech should be dubbed stew or Brian or Klaus or even Yoko. It was this fifth leech I detached and handed to the giant. As I suspected its olfactory senses were unable to distinguish between the lovely center of my blood and the stink of the leech. So it squeezed some blood out onto the back of it huge pore and allowed the width to waft up its enormous nostrils fee fi fo farm it roared again, tiresomely. May I have my leech back now. I said I have urgent business at the viaduct over yonder. I want this leak from myself ruled the giant. This put me in a quandary. As much as my lectures are attached to me physically, I'm attached to them emotionally. That's one reason I bless them with names. How could I not feel a deep connection to beasts in gorged with my own precious blood. But the last thing I wanted to do on this or any other morning was to get into a fight with a giant over elite your Anything else? I tell you what I said, improvising desperately. Give the lead back to me for now wait right here and as soon as I've done my business at the viaduct, I'll take you to my leech supplier. I'm sure he'll be happy to sell you as many leeches as you desire.

Frank Key  10:13
The giant frowned, which I took to be a sign that the cogs in its dim brain was slowly clanking I snatched Stu or Brian or Klaus or Yoko from its poor. I fixed it back to my torso and strode off, not waiting for a reply, read buttoning my shirt and re buttoning my cardigan and re buttoning my coat as I went. My plan of course was to get my business done at the viaduct, and then to take a different route home, avoiding the spinny and the duck pond and thus the giant to I made it almost to the viaduct taking the most direct route by cutting through screwin hoon Puj farmyard when I felt the earth beneath me quaking and looking back sort of my horror that the giant was sprinting, sprinting towards me, each thump of its gigantic boots, making the ground tremble for miles around. At the same time, my ears were assailed by it's terrible roaring. I need not tell you what it was roaring. scarcely Able to Think I looked wildly around and realized I was but yards away from the eerie barn of legend. I hurtled towards it, flung myself inside, and pulled the door shot after me. I was well aware of all the awful tales told about the Erie Ban screwin hunahpu huge farm yard, and what befell those who trespass within it. But my immediate concern was to hide from the giant, and in this I seemed to have succeeded for peering through a knothole in the barn door. I saw it pounding past that in human speed. My hectic panting subsided, and I was breathing normally as I unbuttoned my coat and unbuttoned my cardigan and unbuttoned my shirt and patted each of my five leeches affectionately. Fear not my little blood crammed friends on mattered. You're safe from the giant, safe from the giant indeed, but not Alas, from the nameless horror lurking within the Erie ban at screwin hoon. Puj farmyard. Somehow, that morning, I got out of there alive. How I wish I could say the same for my leeches, but they were ripped untimely from my torso Ripped by something menacing and invisible and fetid and disgusting and terrifying. Something that would have given even my pursuing sprinting giant the collywobbles. Poor john and Paul and George and Ringo, poor Stu or Brian or Klaus or Yoko. I do not know what became of them, nor of my precious blood with which they were in gorged, I left my leeches and my blood in that abominable barn as I fled. And I fled straight into the arms of the giant. It was waiting for me at the side gate of the farm yard. fee fi fo farm, it ruled. I was almost blind with tears, but that didn't stop me thrusting the point of my pawn yard through the giant, gigantic heart. It's foul in pure giants blood gushed spluttering me from head to toe. It crashed to Earth rised and perished. I was in no fit state to sort out my business at the viaduct shooting my bloody pawn yard. I when did my way home pass the spinny and the duck pond when I had hose the giant blood off my coat and my cardigan and my shirt and my scarf and my trousers and my underpants, and my socks and my shoes, and my Homburg. I sat in the bath for an hour. Then I took five fresh leeches out of the league carry them and affixed them one by one to my torso. The first four I named c and phi and fo and farm. The fifth, I decided would remain nameless, like the nameless horror in the airy bonnet screen Hoon Puj farmyard. Thus I paid tribute to my last leeches. My last blood

Frank Key  19:58
I'd like to read you a quotation now this is Frank key again, not low thought preen. I think I did a fairly unconvincing imitation of him but never mind. Yes, this is a quotation from a book by W. l. George, written published in 1916, called the intelligence of woman. Men do not as a rule use PostScript, and it's significant that artists and persons inclined towards the arts are much more given to PostScript than other kinds of men. One might almost say that women correspond by PostScript, some of them put the subject of the letter in the PostScript, as the scorpion keeps his poison in his tail. I have before me letters from case 58 with two PostScript and one extraordinary letter from case 11 with four PostScript and a sentence written outside the envelope, this is the apogee of superficial reality. So we learn from that that real men don't write PostScript, and that the apogee of superfish reality is to scribble a PS on the outside of an already sealed envelope. Clearly, this is something only a girly like case 11 would do. According to wl George, any man exhibiting such behavior must be a mincing on manly fought with an interest in the arts. But wait, his thesis is comprehensively demolished when we consider this passage from the age of Wonder by Richard Holmes, an account of mango parks second African expedition, and I quote, the atmosphere among the surviving members of the expedition is caught in a letter which the cheery hard bitten Captain john Martin wrote ellipses. Finally, he added a scroll note on the stained outer flap of his letter dated the fourth of November. It captures a soldier's Ive view of the British imperial mission. PS, Dr. Anderson and Mills dead since writing the within my head, a little sore this morning, was up late last night drinking ale with a more who has been a good Bronco and speaks English. Got a little tipsy, finished the scene by giving them more a damn good thrashing. Unquote. Now that's hard bitten Captain Martin sound like kind of feminine prancing ninny? I think not. This whole matter of girly PostScript evidently requires further study.

Frank Key  23:38
Yes, we're approaching the end of this week show. Now, I understand. So just a brief reminder, to go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org as I often encourage people to do and I often encourage people to buy books and send donations, send donations to resonance to in fact, as soon as the show has ended. I think you should just you know, go to your computer and send money to me and to resonance. And the next show is apparently about zombies. I think so to get you to provide a superb segue into that. Thinking about you know, the the the flawless sequence of resonance programs to get you in a segue into zombies. I'd like to read a poem by see a bats, which was published in the August to September 1936 issue of weird tales magazine, and is entitled swamp demons. The lights that wink across the southern more like phosphorescent eyes that beckon to risk fell footsteps in the treacherous Fenn, and sink in loathsome muck without a spore. What? Ghosts of former days what dread or your abides within this subterranean den, or reaching out snares victims to its can with Wraith light fingers to a peril shore. told that evil things lurk out of sight with human bones that fester in the ooze. Bear like to screw those bones that once were closed in fleshly form now harbor deadly spite against their living, and this swamp spill brews within its bubbling depths that curse men loathed before they turned to leprous things of night. Gosh, that was pretty honest. I like some of those phrases, the sinking in the load some mark and the sudden more. And, and so on and so forth. Anyway, that's all we've got time for this week. So I hope you've enjoyed this first in the eighth year of hooting out on the air programs. My thanks to pansy cradle drew safe from the collectors from the time being from the Mercy Home. Have you got any final words for the audience pansy.

Unknown Speaker  26:33
Ah, not for the audience. But I would like to say to the Mercy Home Good luck you won't catch me.

Frank Key  26:43
Well, that that's certainly brave words from a very brave, if deranged and yet oddly charming woman. So yes, as I say, that's the end of this week's show. Hope you've enjoyed it. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
