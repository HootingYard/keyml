Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Half an hour of sensible prose. So Billy read. For a long time I used to go to bed early. Often it was still lost as I shut my bedroom door and drew the curtains and buried myself under my blankets. My homemade soundproofing, hundreds of cocked glued to the bedroom walls worked remarkably well, and I treasured the peace and quiet in the rest of the chalet the monkeys could do as they pleased. I was safe in my bed and undisturbed. Ever since I could remember, I'd wanted to live surrounded by monkeys. As a tiny tot, I made toy monkeys out of pipe cleaners and pin cushions. I begged my parents to buy me a real monkey from a monkey shop, not knowing that there were no such shops in our Alpine fastness. As an evil nine year old, I plan to abduct a monkey or two from a zoo, but I was an inept little criminal, and one myself only a fortnight in a blanket camp for miscreant hobby hoys. During a fractious adolescence, I was diverted by brandy and floozies and high tar Peruvian cigarettes. And it was only when I gained my majority and was installed in my own chalet courtesy of a wealthy uncle that my monkey mania reasserted itself. Uncle Arpad was himself fond of monkeys, though not as in my case, to the point of unreason. He had made his fortune in the windmill and plankton trades and had retired to a chalet just up the mountain from the one he bought for me. Every day, I took the funicular railway up to visit him for breakfast, and over a dish of brisket and junk Partridge. He told stories of his past and of other people's pasts and have invented pasts, and he invariably ended these sometimes tedious monologues by encouraging me to live my dreams. He was, I think, a bitter man who regretted that he devoted his life to windmills and plankton and he wanted better for me. descending the mountain after breakfast each day, tramping slowly in my snowshoes, I had time to ponder what I really wanted in life. And I knew in the very depths of my soul, that my greatest desire was to live surrounded by monkeys. Sometimes I carried on down the mountain past my own chalet, until I reached a village in the foothills, where I called into the blue bat Tavern for a chat with popsy Vaughn strathalbyn z popsy was one of the floozies I had dallied within my debauch teenage years. And now she was older and wiser, and ran a stamp collecting club in one of the mountains many sanatoria where weaklings lay slowly perishing on balconies. These days, my tipple was air rated lettuce water, but popsie could still not back the brandy, like a rough, tough Metallo. And she did so day in day out, seemingly with no ill effect. It was to popsy that I confided my dreams and desires. And it was popsy who helped them come true. She too, had a wealthy uncle, also called Arpad and he was a monkey Hunter. All I had to do, he explained was to tell her how many monkeys I wanted of what types and she would arrange for uncle ARP had to hunt them down, stun them with darts, put them into comas and into crates and have them delivered to my door and it would not cost me a penny she added because uncle Arpad like nothing better than monkey hunting. he hunted monkeys with childish Glee, and he was both generous and unhinged. So I drew up a list and gave it to popsy and one bright March morning, the skiing post office person bashed his tippy stick on my chalet door, and I opened it to find several crates containing sleeping monkeys addressed to me. Pop seeds, Uncle Arpad was as good as his word.

I had grown used to living alone, the silence broken only by an occasional yodeling wayfarer or an avalanche. And so for some weeks, things continued for each of my monkeys have been placed into an induced coma for the long journey from their jungle domains. And I had absolutely no idea how snap them out of it. On one of my post breakfast trips to the blue bat, I asked popsy to find out from her uncle how to awaken my monkeys. But she told me with tears in her eyes that our pad had been blown to bits in the Hindenburg airship disaster. I went up to the counter to buy her another brandy to comfort her. And while I waited to be served, I browsed through a copy of the reader's digest that someone had discarded. How fortunate that I did so, for their in between articles such as I am John's ear, and 40 years of hell in a bauxite mine was a piece entitled six easy steps to awaken a monkey from a medically induced coma. I tore the pages out of the magazine got popsy her brandy kissed her goodbye and too impatient to wait for the funicular railway clambered panting up the mountain to my chalet, and to my sleeping monkeys. There were six simple steps and I had six monkeys, even before the crates were delivered. I had chosen names for them. My other great enthusiasm apart from monkeys was the merovingian kings. So the squirrel monkey was called Clovis. The two howler monkeys were dango Bert and Khloe tear. The owl monkey was peppered in the middle. The Capuchin was theodoric and the spider monkey was good and I followed the instructions in the Reader's Digest with the utmost diligence. disinfecting my pliers rinsing out the retort with boiling hot soapy water and even donning a white lab coat to give myself an air of boffin hood. In truth, I did not actually have a lab coat, so I stitched together a couple of proxies capes that I found in my wardrobe and stick them in bleach. One by one, my monkeys woke from their slumbers and began to Cape about the chalet. They were excessively rowdy, quite uncontrollable and fantastically destructive. Shortly afterwards, I glued hundreds of cooks to my bedroom wall and began to go to bed early. My monkeys have never stopped their antics. I love them. So

blocking. The common view is that the great pamphleteer would have flourished in this medium. He would not of course, be out of print, or aggressively the case. And I suppose most of us feel a Pang when we imagine how tremendous it would be to log on to our computers to find fresh blog posts from so Facundo writer and how p Quint it would be to be able to add our own comments to whatever he had to say for himself on any particular day, rather than as we must do, simply scribbling private marginalia. In the few battered and dog eared pamphlets, we may have managed to scavenge from drunk shops and rummage sales and community hub bazaars and compost heaps. Yet the more I think about it, the more I remain unconvinced that Dobson would have taken to blogging as effortlessly as a swan to a pond. The reasons for my hesitancy is threefold. As I'm sure you were aware, dealing with three folds all in one go can cause nervous over excitement and lead to the vapors and the jangles. So I'm not going to talk about the first two folds. The third fold, however, is something I feel sufficiently robust to attend to this evening. As it happens a few weeks ago, I was asked to give a talk on Dobson to the inmates of a crucifix school. It was an outdoor event taking place in a field adjoining the main block a building with a base and British skirt. Fortunately, the weather held and we were not rained upon, as I had feared might be the case earlier in the day, when I become distracted and missed the prognostications of Mr. Daniel Corbett, the eminent forecaster. Usually on these occasions, I like to pick my own topic, whether it would be Dobson and clunking noises or Dobson's use of novels. The pipe cleaners are the textual implications of Dobson's fear of squirrels. Sometimes I make my choice based on what I think will appeal to any given audience. Sometimes I act on mere whim. And sometimes I just blather but this time I've been asked to address the specific question. If Dobson were alive today, would he be a blogger? Or would he continue to churn out pamphlets? It was a rather unwieldy title for a talk, but I accepted the invitation, not least because it came from an endearing flibbertigibbet. I speak of the province debt of the crucifix school mod sprain, for whom in my youth I had carried a torch. Arriving at the field having been to boost from a Shara bank, I was somewhat upset to find that mod was not there to welcome me. In fact, so shredded were my nerves that I let out a great cry of grief. I was hurried into a tent by some sort of aid to camp who gave me a reviving brain tonic and explained that more had been called away to an important meeting. Apparently there was a to do about the crucifix schools preferred biscuit supplier with Huntley and Palmers and peek friends locked in unholy combat. mod had gone to poly with representatives of the two Titanic biscuit makers. Although I have to say that from my memories of her, I didn't think it was a role to which she was suited, as well as being a flibbertigibbet. She was given to going do Lally and throwing breakable items such as jugs against walls. I wonder if the biscuit people had been warned. Having swallowed my second helping of brain tonic, I was led by the aid to camp back out of the tent and across the field to where my audience of Sparky tinies was waiting. It was a terrific field. Apart from modern grass, it was rife with field bind weed convolvulus arvensis with its pink and white flowers, with wayfaring trees, viburnum lantana deciduous shrubs, not trees despite the name close to wild, all red and blackberries with common or red leg persa carrier polygonum persa carrier, a weed with blotches on its leaves allied to the distorts, and with ladies smoke cardamine pratensis, a white or lilac flower often found in damp meadows and fields such as this. Those at least were the four plants I was able to identify before I was bundled nun to gently down into a ditch and from there into a subterranean tunnel. Most tunnels are subterranean. Of course it goes with the territory, but I'm using the words of the aid to camp who actually shoved me in the small of my back hissed,

come come, we must enter this subterranean tunnel. I was perplexed for as far as I was aware of the pupils eagerly awaiting my Dobson lecture were sitting on a tarpaulin in the field above. Equally perplexing was to see that the tunnel was lit by lanterns dangling from hooks hammered into its ceiling. And interspersed with the lanterns dangled bird cages in which perch blind thrushes and sparrows. I stuck my heel into the muck underfoot and rounded upon the aid to camp demanding an explanation. This is where we bring the blind birds, she said. I accepted that at face value, and she persuaded me to continue ahead until we reached a cavernous underground storage facility. It was enormous and chilly. I don't think I've ever seen so many packets of biscuits stacked so neatly in one place. There were piles and piles and piles of them, creating a narrow passageway in the center. I noted that to one side, all the biscuits were humbly and Palmer's and to the other. They were peak friends. You may pick a packet as your payment announced the aid to camp. Now, more than I had not discussed my reimbursement for talking to the tinies about Dobson and blogging. There are some people there are even I regret to say some Dobson lists, who insist upon cash when delivering talks upon the great out of print pamphleteer. Naturally, I'm not averse to a fistful of readies, but it seems to me that spreading the word about Dobson is too urgent and activity to depend necessarily upon the receipt of grubby banknotes. That's it is that in the past, I've accepted payment in various kinds, including a plastic siphon, a Pichet stuff good the hair of a hand criminal A torn and besmirched copy of old crackheads Almanac a share in the ownership of a lame pig, several towels and rags, glue pips, lemon curd, a picture postcard from ins mouth and a cake fork. You might think then, that I would happily snatch a packet of biscuits from this vast underground pantry and return to the surface ready and willing to give my talk on any other day, I may well have done so. But now I was overcome with pangs of pity for the blind birds in cages dangling from hooks in the tunnel. So I told the age to camp that I would forego my Huntley and Palmers or peek friends, and instead wanted her to release the structures and sparrows, and to return them to the blue overarching firmament. She looked at me as if I went bonkers and explained that being blind, the birds would surely be savaged by other bigger predatory birds, such as hawks and vultures, and modern Terra daffodils within minutes of being allowed to flap away into the sky. This sounded like a pretty cogent argument, but I questioned her about the so called modern pterodactyls birds I had not heard of before, and ones I felt sure she'd made up on the spot as a way of persuading me to take a packet of biscuits as Maude originally intended. The age to camp told me something new to me, that the British actor Richard Attenborough ruled as a potentate over a remote island, where he read modern pterodactyls, and other primeval beasts. And should any of the blind thrushes or sparrows managed to get that far before being pecked to pieces by hawks or vouchers, they would surely come a Cropper in the fist razor sharp talons of one or more of Attenborough's avian brood. I happen to have the numeric protocol coordinates for the aged thespian embedded in my portable metal Tapping Machine and considered directing a transmission requesting confirmation of this startling yet somehow credible information from him until I realized that mod sprain had deliberately cited her crucifix school in a so called metal Tapping Machine muffle mentor zone. She could be such a caution. I was left with no alternative but to accept graciously that the savagery of nature outweighed my sentimental impulses, and I plumped for a packet of peek friends bite size at choc marzipan water biscuits. As we made our way back along the tunnel, the aid to camp pointed out to me the gleaming tungsten piping system through which birdseed and nutritionally enhanced water was supplied to the blind birds. I felt reassured.

For some reason I could not fathom the tunnels exit opened upon a different part of the ditch from where we had entered. As we emerged, I saw that in order to get back to the surface, we would have to fight our way through a tangle of gooseberries, goosegrass and goosefoot. The gooseberry is a low spiny bush with globular green fruits. goosegrass, also known as cleavers, is a close relative of bedstraw, which struggles over vegetation clinging to it and to clothing with a tiny prickles on it stems, leaves and fruits. goosefoot is it drainers of weeds with tiny green flowers in leafy or leafless spikes, the communist being fat hen red goosefoot, which often has reddish leaves, many seeded goosefoot and good King Henry. The ditch though was in tangled with stinking goosefoot, which smells repulsively of style fish. Earlier when I told you about the field bind weed, the wayfaring trees, the purser carrier and the lady smoke in the field. I gave you the Latin names, but time presses on so if you want to know the Latin for the gooseberry and goosegrass and goosefoot you'll have to look them up yourself. I recommend a reference work such as the penguin Dictionary of British natural history by Richard and Maisie fitter 1967 as well as telling you about plants named after geese. This invaluable book is packed with hundreds of entries on birds butterflies, fish, flowers, fungi, insects, moths, reptiles and trees. It even tells you the difference between a stone and a weasel. If that's the kind of thing you need to know. The tinies were sat upon their tarpaulins awaiting my talk, but getting to them was clearly going to struggle. According to the bells clanging from the old bell tower, I was due to speak in five minutes time, the age of the camp was fossicking in her Pipi bag, so I asked her what she was looking for. one of two things, she said, either a scented linen rectangle to hold over my nose to counter the overwhelming stench of stale fish from the goosefoot or a big sharp slicing implement a sharp is the talent of one of Richard Attenborough's modern pterodactyls, with which to slice and hue through these plants named after geese. I'm sure I must have one or other in my Pipi bag, if not both. I could see why mod had made so resourceful a woman her aid to camp and wondered what else might lurk in the Pipi bag, but I was far too polite to ask. I drummed my fingertips against my temples, as the rummaging continued, conscious that time was ticking away on the clock on the old belltower and that we were in grave danger of being late for the tinies. mortared stipulated that I had to begin my talk on time, but only by doing so could I hope to locate the strange gods who loomed over the crucifix school, always quick to anger and in their anger to smite the building and blast it to ruin. much good would my packet of peak frames do me if I allowed such a cataclysm to occur? Like the weed choking the ditch, the looming gods were goose God's aggressive web of foot and with feathers of whitish hue, differing from mortal geese in that they were doubly aggressive, doubly webbed doubly white of immense size and spectral. I watched them now looming with menace over the school ready to strike to be assuaged only by my talk to the tinies on the tarpaulin. And still, the aide de camp was scrambling in her Pipi bag like a badger in Bracken. There were scarce 40 seconds to go when she shrieked a triumph and cry, slapped a scented linen rectangle over her nose, and sliced up the gooseberry goosegrass and goosefoot with a big sharp slicer, and with one bound, we jumped free of the ditch and pelted towards the tinies a second aide de camp had given each of them a tumbler of purple pop and a radish to keep them quiet. So I was met with absolute silence as I took my place on the speaking mat. I glanced up and allowed myself a small, wrinkly smile as I saw the goose God's flock away into the ether. And then I tapped my fingerprints, fingertips upon my calf, and cleared my throat. Greetings, tinies.

I boomed my spine straight and my Buffon unruffled. I am here today to talk upon the topic. If Dobson were alive today, would he be a blogger? Or would he continue to churn out pamphlets? I'm sure some of you think you know the answer. Well, I've thought long and hard about this question. And my conclusion may surprise you. You see, I don't think Dobson would ever have become a blogger. for one simple reason. bloggers type on computer keyboards, but Dobson always wrote in a little notepad with a pencil. I rest my case. And that, in a nutshell, is the essence of the third fold in my three fold argument. If you're avid for details of the first and second fold, I may be tempted to tell, but only if you send me some biscuits. I leave it up to you. Whether you send Huntley and Palmers or peak friends.

For a long time, I used to go to bed early. And I mean early. Sometimes I'd go to bed and maybe 10 or 15 minutes after I'd got up. My alarm would clang I bound out of bed hale and hearty, splash my face with icy water from the spigot gobble down some sponge cake with a dollop of marmalade, yawn and stagger back into bed and fall asleep and dream. For much of this period, it's probably true to say that I lived in dreamland rather than in the real world. Although madaling maddeningly I could never remember more than a few disconnected and unintelligible fragments of my dreams. I would wake with vague fugitive visions of for example, Hazel, Blears juggling cream crackers, and wind swept more land and our bino hens in a concrete bath, but with Not a clue as to the significance of any of them. I suppose I could have gone to see a psychic or a psychiatrist if I desperately needed to know the meaning of my dreams. But I really stayed awake long enough to make that possible, and it was very unlikely that I could get one to come to me, given the forbidding nature of my home. I lived at this time at the top of a tower on a promontory lashed by gales. The tower was blackened with grime and weatherbeaten and crumbling. The prominent tree too, was crumbling perceptibly great chunks of it breaking off and falling into the sea every day. I knew that I would have to move out of the tower to find a safer haven. But to do so, I would have to remain awake for at least an hour or two. I prefer to sleep and to dream. The bed I've referred to was not really a bed as you would understand it. It could more accurately be described as a matter of scattered hay and straw with the occasional lump of mud and cloud of muck tucked here and there. For a pillow. I have a long day grunting hog, expertly preserved and stuffed by an equally long dead taxidermist. My dubay was one of the first of its kind to be imported into this country. It was to tonic puffy and bulked out with compressed stable gas and grease resistant. No wonder I slept so soundly. My room at the top of the tower had once been a bird loft, and the skeletons of a number of starlings and Robbins was still strewn on the rafters and cells. No birds came while I lived there, for birds have always been fearful of me, even when I'm asleep. Very, very occasionally during these years, I would remain up and about for more than 10 or 15 minutes. Sometimes I shuffled down the ladder to the foot of this tower to inspect the crumble moment of the promontory at close quarters. Sometimes I hide over old mar purgatives clifftop superstore to fetch supplies of sponge cake and marmalade. Sometimes I filled the bat with the clanger on my alarm to try to muffle it a tad. Sometimes I taunted far away birds by shaking a stick in the air and shouting, but mostly in those days. I used to go to bed early.

Finally, just time for this. Bring me a cup of foaming grog and bring me some rags to mop up the spillage Bring me a lantern to light my way through the gruesome lines of your gruesome village bring me gas trapped inside a bulb Bring me a peg on a platter of lead. Bring me your huddled bring me your sick bring me your puny and bring me your dead. Bring me things I haven't asked for yet. Bring me a badger torn from its set. Bring me creatures from the bottom of the sea twitching and flapping and flailing in net. Bring me the kind of aftershave used by Peter winguard playing Jason King. God bless do bring me just about anything. There is nothing that I do not crave as I sit here in my cold damp cave, banished from the palace, where I sat on a divan, the potentate of my vanquished clan, we will vanquished good and proper by the men with whisks. It was all recorded on compact discs. They even have a backing band as they smashed each bone and skull. I can't be sure, but I think it was Jethro Tull. Bye bye.
