Good afternoon, this is resonance 104 point four FM My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. But more importantly, it's David Blunkett 60th birthday. So Happy Birthday David Blunkett. The other day I listened belatedly, to a little atoms interview with Jonathan Meade's, it's available for download. It was on broadcast on resonance. earlier last month, go to www dot a little atoms.com and you can download it. It's the second second appearance by Jonathan Meade's dated the 11th of may 2007. Each of the little atoms shows has a musical interlude often chosen by the guest, the magnificent Meads perhaps the only reason to watch television these days, picked lanzoni della mod a peduto by fabella. To date Andre, not being at all familiar with Italian kantoor rays of the late 20th century. His name was new to me, but I adored the song so I decided to find out more. You can go and read his entry on the Wikipedia as I did, and do further research if you wish, as I haven't yet. The entry on Wikipedia devotes a paragraph to Fabrizio de Andres kidnapping by Sardinian bandits in 1979, which is interesting, but I thought I'd draw your attention to two other things about him mentioned in passing. That particularly intrigued me. They Andres first wife was named puny. That's a superbly hooting yard ish name is net. I don't think it will be too long before a character named puny turns up in a piece of prose on hooting yard, perhaps one that features heroic infant tiny Enid. I recall that somewhere or other I refer to a book or a film entitled, I was puny vercingetorix and though puny there was intended as an adjective rather than as a first name, I might have to revisit that in the light of my new knowledge. The other thing that made me slap my forehead with glee was the title of Fabricio de Andres second album, or rather the contrast between the name of the second album and the titles of the first and the third album. His first album, I think, in 1967, or 1968, was called Volume One. And his third album was called volume three. Yet for some extraordinary reason, the title of what a lesser artist would have called Volume Two, his second album was called Twitty multimo, as tento or we all die agonizingly sorry, we all died agonizingly, which I think is a great album title. Anyway, that's the thing about Jonathan means he provides you with new and unexpected avenues to explore even when he's just picking a piece of music.

And now back to normal hooting yelled service. This is a story called The Man Who Would Be Dobson. Dobson was a great collector of coupons. Almost all coupons are redeemable in one form or another, but not in Dobson's world. Do not even think of it. Jing Mei to redeem any of my coupons he shouted more than once, when it was gently suggested to him that he was sitting on a fortune in unredeemed coupons. Curiously for a man so attached to the written word, the pamphleteer preferred coupons with minimal or no wording, and those which were beige in color. Another thing he used to say or to shout was, I cannot be doing with flimsy coupons made of paper. He never said so explicitly. But for Dobson the earth coupon was a small, blank beige, rectangular piece of cardboard. A few years ago, I was sitting in a snack bar when something curious happened. Some would say the mere fact of me sitting in the half civilized air of a snack bar is curiosity enough, given the line more usually to be found sprawled in a ditch or languishing loosely in a damp and derelict farmyard outhouse, but stay with me on this one, if you will. I'd rather not explain what I was doing tucking into a snack in a snack bar in mid afternoon on Tuesday. togged out in what I have to say was a rather fetching Lord summer I'll yellow Polo neck and drainpipe trousers combination. Granted, I do not have the Buffon's sported so majestically by Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man, and perhaps there was rather a lot of straw snagged in my hair together with the odd beetle. But all I can say is that I cut a pretty dashing figure. my surroundings probably had something to do with it, as it was a bloody fantastic snack bar, all things considered. Anyway, I wish tromping my way through my snack when the man behind the counter began to sing. It was not a song on you. The verses seem to consist mostly of extracts from the book of Isaiah. There was a bit that went, he is gone up to badges and to D bomb, the high places to weep. Moab Shao over niebo and over Madiba, which I recognized, but it was when the snack bar tena got to the chorus that my ears really pricked up. Yay. And I shall wash myself in the blood of the lamb and plead with the Lord to get me a small blank beige rectangular piece of cardboard. He's saying this was extraordinary. This was a song about the out of print pamphlet is a coupon could Dobson have written it himself? I choked on my potted paste pie and leaped to my feet. For a second I wonder if the gasps from an adjoining table meant that I was not the only Dobson is to frequent this snack bar. But then I realized that my neighbors were gazing austrac my Winkle pickers, who can blame them? I flashed a rakish smile, a beetle drop from my hair, and I looked elegantly over to the counter. I gave my back to the spiders and my cheeks to them that plucked off their hair. The man was singing now, but I held up my hand and stopped him. Tell me, I drawled not wanting to sound too excited. What is that song you're singing? The man held up a little sign informing me that he was deaf as a post. So I repeated my question using the only sign language I know, which is a version of the botsman system that I learned as a youth in the Kindred of the kiboko gift movement. Luckily, the stone Deaf singer knew it too. Later, he was to explain to me that he had not learned the system in the kiboko gift, but to my astonishment, directly from botsman himself, shortly before that towering figure was blown up in the Hindenburg. If one can Jabba in sign language we've jabbered 10 minutes in by which time I was leaning as insouciantly as I could against the counter, the better to show off my poise. The snack bar singer broke off from our conversation to Harry the rest of the smackers out into the wind and the rain. He slammed the door shatters the last one left, locked it with a surprisingly enormous key and pulled down the blind. Then he took me into a back room beyond the kitchen and the pantry, and we settled ourselves in for what I can only describe as a Dobson a song. It's not a pretty word, but I can't think how else to describe a discussion that continued virtually uninterrupted for the next four days.

It turned out that my new pal was an autodidact, who had for the past decade, devoted himself to getting to the bottom of this thing Dobson had about coupons. It was a narrow speciality To be sure, but the world needs people like him. He confessed that he was completely uninterested in the bulk of the pamphlet his pamphlets had never read them and never intended to, and indeed, could not care less about any aspect whatsoever of Dobson's activities, savor his coupon mania. I wonder if ghido I learned his name eventually on day three, I think, was himself a coupon collector. I put this to him in my best attempt at a Terry Thomas voice. And it was the only time during the whole Dobson athon that he laughed. At least I think he laughed. He gurgled. Cata, Wald, who did make noises similar to those of an enraged badger shrieked and spat all over the table. Something in his demeanor signaled that he expected me to fetch your mop and wipe down the Formica. But I have pride as well as poised so I spat on the table myself repeatedly, though I forbore, from the gurgling and caterwauling, etc, that gave him pause, so much so that it was like sitting opposite a life sized wooden effigy in the backroom of a snack bar. Although this was not an experience I had ever had before, or not precisely, I knew instinctively how to deal with it. I reached with a certain deafness into a pocket of my drainpipe trousers and kept the lid from a tiny bottle of Dr. Baxter's cranium agitator, wafted it under guidos nose, and was rewarded by the side of him twitching back to life, just as I had suspected. And so our conversation was able to continue, though I never did find out the answer to my question. To this day, I have no idea if ghido two was a coupon enthusiast in his own right. I saw no evidence that any coupons had been masked within the snack bar. And I had a damn good search when my host took a toilet break. But of course, he may have been one of those collectors who keeps his cargo in the safety deposit box of a large and important foreign bank, just as Dobson did, if we're to believe the janitor of a large and important foreign bank, who contributed a letter to the quarterly digest of Dobson studies, volume x IV, number two, a letter which the editor authenticated is genuine after subjecting it to a battery of forensic tests, such as the dedication of those who take these matters with true seriousness. It's a trait I admire, and I admired it in ghido justice he admired my yellow Polo neck sweater and my effortless social graces now guidos song which had so transfixed me, and forged a bond between us was self penned Dobson it appeared had had nothing to do with it. I can't say this surprised me. We all know that the pamphlet his few attempts at songwriting were absolutely pathetic, hardly the kind of thing to worry proper songsmith such as to pluck a name at random Leo Sayer. Others have written about the horrors of hearing Dobson dodges such as the god awful drinky everyone the waters of his own system until I come and take you away. So I need an add to the Brickbats what intrigued me was why ghido robbed of hearing by that kindergarten firework mishap had chosen to compose a song about Dobson's coupon Oh philia. And not only that, but a song which ate the pamphlet his own wailings in many respects, of course, guidos work was a thing of melodic loveliness. So in that sense, it differed. But even so the whole business struck me as a bit fishy.

Over a dish of shredded cabbage and bloaters. Towards the end of our long talk, my Powell told me that what he was trying to do was to somehow become Dobson the better to understand him. This was such a startling admission that I'm afraid I banged my knee on the underside of the table and let out a Yelp. Which Let me tell you is an unforgivable breach of etiquette. When one is sharing a meal with a snack bar counterman of guidos eminence, I was mortified. I knew he had not heard my Yelp, but he had seen it and had probably felt its vibration in the air around his impossibly handsome head. I left for my napkin, with as much daintiness as I could muster stood up leaving my bloaters half eaten and swept out of the room through the pantry and the kitchen and the snack bar itself. wrench the strangely enormous key in the lock flung open the door, as if I were at a vital moment in a Terence Rattigan drama, and hit the grimy streets of this hepcat town, wishing I had a muffler to muffle me against the wind. What I was muffled against for weeks afterwards was shame. It's my own lack of table manners. Unable to face up to the enormity of my conduct. I retreated to my usual haunts the ditches and the barnyard, and tried to blame the fiasco on ghido. On the rare occasions I was approached by a peasant of those parts, I would beseech them not to go anywhere near the snack bar, thinking to smash asunder what today would be called it customer base. I used some of the straw snagged in my hair to fashion a ghido like voodoo doll and stuck it with pins innumerable. But came the day I found myself first whistling, then humming then boy oh boy, singing Lastly, from a mountaintop that stirring chorus about Dobson's small blank Bay rectangular piece of cardboard is a coupon and tears streamed down my face, as I understood how fortunate I had been to spend four days with the man who would be Dobson. He wasn't Of course, no one could be. But ghido came closer, I think, than anyone else ever has to being imbued with the pamphlet his crew spirit. It was a privilege to know him. I'm still on that mountain top still singing, dressed now in the apparel of a beatnik but minding my manners more than ever, and still attracting guff from passers by.

Drink tea everyone the waters of his own system until I come and take you away. As we've just learned, this was the title of a song written by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson, one of several appalling stabs he made it the form. No one with any sense has ever listened to a Dobson song more than once for the experience is excruciating, as I can avow. That is by no means all i avow. And if we had but well done often time, I would give you a list of every single of our I have ever made, which I'm sure you would find interesting to listen to. But last time presses heavy is a big lump of iron, and you will have to be satisfied with that single vow of the frankly horrifying nature of the Dobson songbook beside which the Necronomicon of the Mad Arab Abdul al has read is like an infant picture book devoted to perky piglets and bunny rabbits. Drink tea everyone the waters of his own system until I come and take you away is also a line from the book of Isaiah Authorized Version chapter 36. Verses 16 and 17. Most of the lyrical content of Dobson's wretched songs was taken from Isaiah for no apparent reason. One would have thought so prolific a pamphleteer would have been capable of penning his own words, even keen to do so. Not Dobson. What he appears to have done so far as we can tell, is to pick phrases pretty much at random from the book Peter Ackroyd has called a series of incandescent utterances to shove them together with no regard for cents or meter or singer ability, and then to set them to music so woefully inadequate that it beggars belief. No wonder marigold, two took to wearing a pair of reinforced cork earplugs. Discovering the standard ear plugs sold at Huberman fail to block out completely the den from Dobson's rehearsal room, the resourceful marigold located a cork reinforcing a tele a hard by the banks of the great frightening River. On her first visit, she was surprised to discover the workshop populated entirely by gnomes, some Swiss, some Austrian and some claiming citizenship of gondwanaland. They may have been disturbingly proportioned little men wearing pointed caps She later wrote, but they certainly knew how to reinforce caulk. As with all his fads, Dobson songwriting shenanigans petered out after a couple of months and peace once more rained in the house. But marigold, true enchanted continue to visit the little people by the river for the rest of her life. drinky everyone the waters of his own system until I come and take you away. In other words, the grumpy man roared at a cowering tangle of orphans. He waylaid one terrible Thursday afternoon. The palyed tinies were foraging for roots and scraps in a noise some ditch beyond blister lane. When cracks of lightning rent the sky thunderclaps boomed and before they could run back to the safety of the orphanage, that grunty man was there. They had thought him a mere figment of nightmares, but here he was all too real solid and hairy and brutish, and grunting. They trembled as the grumpy man repeated his strange and evil plan. All except one precocious orphan, who put her hand up to ask a question, as if we were in a classroom rather than in a noisy ditch. This disconcerted the grantee man who was impatient for the nippers, dogleg down the water from their systems so he could carry them away to his horrible they're up in the hills as his scheme dictated. We did not bring our systems with us on our foraging expedition, piped up the brave tot, so maybe Wait, so may we be excused to go back to the orphanage and there to drink from them everyone. As soon as the grunty man had granted his confused agreement to this, or failed, scampered back to Pang Hill orphanage, where they armed themselves with

pitchforks and shovels. Then they burst out through the iron gate as one and ran back to the ditch and chased the grunty man back into the hills from whence he had come. For many long years after that fateful Thursday afternoon, the grumpy man sat screwing in his layer, trying in his slow witted way to work out the flaw in his plan, which as I said before, was both evil and strange.

Since the hooting our website was relaunched, at the beginning of this year as a as a blog, in kind of blog format, instead of the format. It used to be. The format I used to be in, it's very difficult to index anything and you can't find anything. And there's this huge archive of stuff, and occasionally has been suggested to me that I could reprint some of the earlier material in the new blog format. I haven't done too much of that. But today, for some reason, it took my fancy to Republic six Bulgarian folk tales, which appeared about three years ago on the hooting yard website in the summer and autumn of 2004. Made him to think that's three years ago. And I'd like to read all six tales to you now and I've decided to read them in one go. So what you're going to hear without a break for without a break from one storage of the next is Ooh, go goofs off. Who goes POW off? Who goes pod? Who goes new hooter? Ooh, go turns blue. And Ooh, go goes loopy without breaks but I think you'll spot where the breaks are. And I'm just going to have a sip of tea before beginning this marathon reading of half a dozen Bulgarian folk tales in one go.

In cloth Dave Ugo had a power called off. Off had the plague. Look at my boo Bo Ugo said off, ou said Ugo when he saw their Boo Boo. Boo go had the flu.

For the time being in the lazur Reto in Plovdiv, in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo plopped, is poured onto a stone. Who goes Maher said, ooh, go, why are you using a pod instead of a jar? Who goes Maher was blind, but she knew that the plopper do goes of who goes pod was different than the plop of his jar. Omar said, ooh, go, my jar is in the shade. Who goes mar batuu go on the head.

One morning in Plovdiv. Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the yard and made a noise like a shrew, thinking there was a shrew in her yard, who goes blind march to teach her hooter to alert the Plovdiv trooper troll. But ego started to sound like a goose. Ooh said who goes ma? What am I to do? a shrew and a goose? Then Ugo began to Moo like a cow.
