Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank T. And this is hooting yard on the air. And I was much taken with the opening track on that cassette drum mentioned he was what was it he was born on earth to die. That's kind of true all of us isn't it? But I think I'd like to hear that and in fact I may I may even do my own version. If once I've heard it, the skip is full of obviously this Yes, but the cassette has obviously fallen out of favor because there are dozens upon dozens of copies of it in the skips are might pick one up and take one home. However that will have to wait. Latin American death cap. Eastern North American destroying Angel. Guangzhou destroying Angel. Great felt skirt destroying Angel.

Do not eat any of the things I have just mentioned. for no apparent reason that was a list of funghi with significant risk of death if consumed. So I don't recommend eating any of those. Here's a story. Once upon a time, there was a clucking thing. It was made of wire and wax and string and it made a clucking noise when you press the knob. The knob was located on what might have been its head I say might have been because the thing didn't really have a head, not a proper head, like my head or your head. It was a sort of boxy shape this thing. The knob was set over to one side on the very upper part of it, which tapered slightly. That's why I said head because the knob was on the upper part. To give you some idea where the knob set lower, as low as could be, I could have said it was located on the things foot even though it did not have a foot or feet north as such. It was not a mobile thing. If he wanted to move it, you have to pick it up and put it where you wanted it to be. And it would stay there until he picked it up again and moved it somewhere else. It did not make the clacking sound unless you press the knob. It was yellow. It was yellow except for the knob which was red or perhaps orange. Also, its underside was beige. But its underside was almost always resting on the floor, and so was not visible. If you picked it up and rested it on its side, or in a moment of hysteria upside down. It did not clock when you press the knob. No matter how hard and insistently and repeatedly you pressed the knob. It had to be placed upright, with the beige part on the floor. It was roughly the same size as a big duck. If you placed a microphone next to it to amplify the clucking sound when you press the knob, the proximity of the microphone created some sort of feedback. Then the thing how old a terrifying ear splitting how whether or not you were pressing the knob. It would continue howling until you move the microphone somewhere else further away, preferably into a different room, or even into a different building. After howling, the thing would take some time to settle itself before pressing its knob would make it clock. Immediately after howling. When you press the knob. The thing would wheeze you would probably have to wait about five minutes before it would clock again properly.

The thing did not do anything except else except clock. How or wheeze. It fulfilled no higher purpose. Unless you were particularly fond of boxy, yellow immobile things. It did not really prettify a room, like a vase of brilliant flowers, or a framed picture of a Parson skating on a frozen pond was not the only thing of its kind in the world. At the last count, there was something like 20 million of them. Most of them the things that clock when you press the knob were buried in landfill sites. human ingenuity can be immensely befuddling.

been keeping up with keeping abreast of things that hooting yard will know that I'm currently working on a book of brief lives. I read, I read some of them a few two or three weeks ago. They don't really live they're just one, one or two interesting bits and pieces about the various subjects. So you don't really learn anything of their entire lives. But I thought I'd read a few more for your entertainment and enlightenment and education. I'll try not to repeat any of the ones I've read a few weeks ago, but if I do it, we'll just have to put up with the repeat. JOHN Barrymore, American actor 1882 to 1942. Barrymore kept a menagerie of pets, including an opossum, a kink a Jew, whatever that is. Deer, cats, dogs, and hundreds of exotic birds. One of his favorites was a vulture named Maloney, which would perch on his shoulders and preen his mustache and eyebrows. He also had a monkey called Clementine, which bit everybody except Barrymore himself. Clementine would sit quiet, still, gazing adoringly at the actor for hours. Yvette eventually explained that the monkey was transfixed by the fumes of alcohol reeking from her master after Barrymore was persuaded to give Clementine away to a zoo. He used to visit her there and breathe on her. Mary Bateman, English poisoner, 1768 to 1809 Mary Bateman was responsible for you for the prophetic hen of lead hoax. In 1806. a hen began to lay eggs on which Christ is coming with written the alleged which had used acid to write on the eggs and then reinserted them into the hen. Three years later, she was hanged for poisoning Rebecca perigo, who had asked her for her help in lifting a curse. Peter Bayliss English Actor 1922 to 2002 Bayless is dying words were my spacesuit has developed a fault. He often went out accompanied by an invisible pet dog for many years, the message on his answering machine with his impersonation of a parrot saying Peter Bayless is not available. He's got out to get my bird seed.

I think we have a poltergeist the door to the studio just opened and no one came in, or was in fact visible. And then the door closed again. Interesting. Could be a poltergeist Bernard of clairvaux, Frank Abbott and St. 1092 1153. St. Bernard, the founder of the Cistercian order, warned the faithful specifically about jugglers. He wrote, a man fond of jugglers will soon enough, possess a wife whose name is poverty. If it happens, that the tricks of jugglers have forced upon your notice, and Deborah to avoid them, and think of other things very useful tip You ever say a juggler? Just think of something else, which is easier said than done when you're looking at a juggler, but St. Bernard of clairvaux could do it so so can you. Hadrian Babyland, Dutch philosopher and classical scholar 1650 to 1716 when bevel and published Original Sin, his survey of the sexual abnormalities of the ancient world in 1679, it was denounced by the authorities at Leiden University as abominable and scandalous, and an abortion from deprived brains. He was banished from Holland, never to return. He spent the rest of his life in London, where shortly before he died, he wrote the song of the bots of prey. And I'd like to read that to you now. There is no music to it as far as I know, but it's called the song of the bolts of pray. I have no wife. The devil upon two crutches. Cheer cheer here. Carry me to hell. I do not know my L where Hell is but if it may please your l I carry you to the devil. Go on to the devil tavern. What upon crackers? I am very old if it may please your l no old devil can please me. Have you know younger devils in hell? Yes. Long Brown who carries little David's upon his shoulders? What is become of metal Gibson?

After much experience of table wrapping and seances, Buchanan became convinced that dead doctors were far more effective than living ones. The late Dr. wells of Brooklyn has been giving diagnoses and prescriptions through the Telegraph, he wrote, I have repeatedly stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased physicians have always proved in my experience more reliable than those of the living.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, English writer 1772 to 1834 Samuel Rogers Table Talk gives this glimpse of Coleridge and Wordsworth. Coleridge was a marvelous talker, Wordsworth and I called upon him one for noon, when he was in a lodging of power Mao. He talked uninterruptedly for about two hours, during which Wordsworth listens to him with profound attention every now and then nodding his head as if in a cent on quitting the logging, I said to Wordsworth, well, for my own part, I could not make head nor tail of cola reduce aeration, pray, did you understand it? Not one syllable of it was Wordsworth reply.

Once upon a time, there was a thing that clank clank clank, clank, it went clank, clank clank, clank, clank it kept on clanking monotonous and tireless the clanking had some connection with steam. Steam. Then it so happened that one day, it went clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk the second time, and after a long pause a third time, and then it wheezed, and then it was silent and still, a man came. He had a wrench and a hammer, and other such things. He carried them in a Pipi bag. The man deployed his wrench and hammer and other such things, clambering up on the thing that used to Clank and borrowing beneath it too. Every now and then he would step back to gaze at it from a distance. And at these times he would furrow his brow and rub his chin with his hand. Then it began to rain over proper older downpour, almost biblical. The man hold the tar pulling over the thing that once had clanked. But now Clank no more. He trudged off to a hut to smoke his pipe. It was while he was smoking his pipe that he heard news on the transistor radio in the heart. The announcer, in a plummy voice, said there was an uprising of peasants. The peasants were in a flap about several matters. One such matter being the clanking thing. It's clanking disturb the birds, and the birds shunned the area around the thing, yay, even under a radius of two miles. The uprising peasants did not explain why they were in such a flap about the absence of birds. The man smoking his pipe in the heart, realized that the clanking thing must have been sabotaged by the peasants. It struck him that if he fixed it with his wrench and hammer, and other such things, as he'd been trying to do when the rain began to fall, that the peasants would be in an even greater flap, and they would likely hunt him down and beat him to death with their shovels. So when the rain stopped, at last, he pops his wrench and hammer and other such things into his Pipi bag, and he trudged away back to his chalet on a mountainside somewhere far away. But before he left, he turned to take a last look at the clanking thing, now silent and still and covered by a tarpaulin and he saw that five or six birds had already come to perch upon it. And as he walked away, more and more birds arrived, swooping down to perch on the top hauling until there were thousands of them in serried ranks. terrible as an army with banners.

I accidentally knocked the microphone just as I finished reading that piece. So if you heard a thud that was what the thud was, it wasn't the Poltergeist again. Or was it? You will never know. And to there's only about five or five or so minutes of the show left I'm going to read you yet more brief lived. Henry J. Horn, American medium dates undisclosed by the spirit world. Henry J.

Ted Hughes, English poet 1932 1998. In the 1960s, in collaboration with the theatre director Peter Brook, Hughes devised a new language called August earthy and primal August would be able to express things ordinary namby pamby languages could not eventually have a vocabulary of about 2000 words, but these only 50 counters real August. A standard phrase, such as one you would use every day, like darkness opens its womb, translates into August as blogger on Balon fraud. And that's all in capital letters. And, yes, finally, William Leonard hunt, Canadian financial analyst 1838 to 1929. As the great ferrini hunts cross the Niagara falls on a tightrope in 1860.

There he put on acts including the human Cannonball, pongo, the gorilla, manatee mermaids, and the Beckwith family who, while submerged in one of the aquarium tanks, got undressed, smoked cigars, and ate to sponge cakes. Isn't that a not an act you'd like to see? I'm reminded by by the Beckwith family of the penningtons, who I'll tell you about next week, but the penningtons if there are any Australians listening, you may well remember the Piddington they will be great Australian mental telepathy tests of the 1950s I can't remember their first names, I think I think Mrs. pilling gun was Selma. Anyway, I'll try and find out a bit more about the puddings and for next week, when I'll be back with more stuff similar to what you've been listening to for the last half an hour with your head in your hands and your tongue hanging out and worrying about that resonance Poltergeist. Bye bye.
