Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Last week's hooting yard show was mostly taken up with one rather lengthy piece. So ringer changes this week I'm going to read a number of different and shorter pieces. So if anytime you get bored in just wait, wait couple of minutes and you'll hear the music again, which is the Caucasian lullaby by slap happy and Henry cow. A piece of music which I realized to my heart is about 33 years old. Anyway. Yes, so, let's begin with one short piece. This is called Fritz his hinge and his pips. Fred's his hinge and his pips is the terrific new bestseller from pebble head. This time the paperback paperback just gives us a thriller. And gosh, it certainly makes for an exciting read. The beginning of the book, though, is deceptively slow moving even down. We learned that the eponymous hero is an emotional cripple who wallows in a stew of malignant vetch mats. He is an attractive character, wearing unattractive clothing, giving off an unattractive Pong and living in an unattractive chalet in an unattractive seaside resort. We do not warm to him, as we learn in chapters one and two of his grumbling and his scruffy dog and the bits of celery and spring onion forever stuck in his beard. We are repelled by his grimy bathtub and his many stains. But then in chapter three, pebble head pulls the rabbit out of the hat, and we're off on a pell mell roller coaster ride of thrills and spills are plenty. What happens is that Fritz decides one morning to eat a piece of fruit. It is a pip riddled fruit, and Fritz spits out the pips with such force that they log in the hinge of his door. The door is ajar at the time because Fritz's scruffy dog has leaped into the chalet garden to piss on a Briar Patch. When the dog comes back in for it to goes to close the door, but cannot. It turns out that the pips for it spat across the room are of adamantine hardness, and lodged in the hinge prevent the door from shutting. Fast begins a sequence of events that propels Fritz and his scruffy dog through a series of adventures that begins in an ironmonger sharp and rapidly moves on to a coat hanger factory, a sausage makers, the undersea headquarters of a madcap swordfish person and a barn full of cows. All the while, the pips remain stuck in the hinge and the chalet door stays maddeningly ajar. Yet as the story progresses, Fritz's Veldt Schmitz becomes a less malignant and his dog less scruffy by chapter 49. When we find fruit, picking bits of celery and spring onion out of his beard and disposing of them done a hygienic shoot, we're ready to forgive the grime Enos of his bathtub. It must be said that the novel is not an unalloyed success. I could have done without the excessive use of exclamation marks for example, and pebble heads PIP descriptions are deplorable. I suspect he may have copied them out of a trip botanical Gazzetta without first checking its accuracy. He has committed similar sins in the past, notably in the wet behind the ears trilogy, vast chunks of which were plagiarized from a mistranslated Serbian birdseed catalog. But these minor cavils aside frets his hinge and his pips is A tremendous addition to the pebble headcanon. Read it with your feet up on your balcony. If you have a balcony with a bag of snacks at your side, the constant tweeting of chaffinches assailing your ears, freshly laundered socks on the washing line sprites in the wainscot, and butchers drapes, billowing in the balmy spring breeze.

And now, the legend of the Golden pig. The circumstances in which I first heard the legend of the Golden pig was oddly similar to those of the Sermon on the Mount, crushed in a multitude. I followed a beer the man up onto a hillock and sat down and listened to him speak well, more or less, there were two or three of us rather than a heaving mass of humanity. It was a flat field, not a hillock, and we did not listen to a bat man speaking to us directly, but to the disembodied voice of a woman broadcast from a radio set, perched on the back of a farmer's cart. The Voice belonged to the woman of twigs. The radio set was pneumatic, and the cart belonged to mad old farmer frac. It was his field we gathered in and it was partially flooded. There was no sign of the horse we assumed must have pulled the cart into the middle of the field. old farmer frac only had one horse named Desmond. So it was likely he had let it off, let it off along the lane to the fruit and nut market. It seemed he planned to leave the cart in the field for some time, for its wheels had been removed. I had seen the cart before, so I knew that they were the big wheels of Motown to where I guess they were being returned. There were wheels within wheels too, and it had to be assumed they were also bound from Motown. My companions and I found a patch of field relatively free of puddles, and crouched in the muck to listen to the voice of the woman of twigs. It was hard to tell whether it was a live broadcast or had been pre recorded, and the reception from the pneumatic radio set could have been better. buffeting winds howling across the flat landscape caused interference, and we had to take off our densely knit waxed woolen hats and prick up our ears. We were glad about the winds though, for they kept spinning the sails of the windmills on Pang Hill, unlike the windmills of your mind, so memorably sang about by Rex Harrison's some novel, The Pang Hill windmills were proper windmills. And on days when the air was still in their sails Creek to a halt, there was something ineffably sad about them. ineffably sad to was the cracked and desolate voice of the woman of twigs, or she told the legend of the Golden pig, which was what we had come to the fields to hear. old farmer frac had sent out a circular a fortnight earlier to announce this cultural event. It was a welcome interruption to the unremitting tedium of our rustic malaise, as thrilling and its way as the visit of the traveling cinematic graph the previous year, when we had been treated to a showing in a different but no less Southern field of the first and second reels of Ivan Reitman's classic picture, my super ex girlfriend. It was a mystery how mad old farmer frack found the resources to provide us with such entertainments. He appeared to spend his entire time driving his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly bellowing as he did so, but obviously there was another side to him which we did not see. It was hard to imagine him brokering deals in the offices of media moguls, his huge ox like frame squashed into a tubular steel executive seating pod poring over spreadsheets. But we supposed it must be so the advanced PowerPoint presentation skills certificate nailed up on the side of a cow buyer and laminated to protect it from rainstorms was evidence that old farmer frac had an in a management pointy head to whom he occasionally gave vent.

The same could not be said of the woman of twigs, she seemed to hail from an entirely other world, remote and ancient and Savage. I once read an exciting and completely comprehensible essay in the very difficult Journal of post modernists in penetrability, entitled Pepe the pony and tweet transgressive hermeneutics in narratives of the other, hoping that I might gain some insight into the frankly bewildering nature of the woman of twigs, but I was disappointed. The last minute text or discourse had nothing in it to help me understand a weird, immensely tall Crone draped in a burlap shift with countless twigs stuck in her mop of matted ghost white hair. My time was not entirely wasted, however, as the essay contained, and the student devastating analysis of Ross and Marshall Thurber, his film, dodgeball, which I hope to see one day if alfama frac is able to bring the traveling cinema back to one of his fields. I was mildly perplexed that the woman of twigs had chosen not to appear in person to tell us the legend of the Golden pig. Until recently, she had been a familiar sight in our bucolic paradise, tottering about by the horse trough, or standing majestic and wind swept in the middle of the Moore's certain spiteful gossips put it about though she had taken the Murdoch shilling, and was due to host a breakfast time chat show on Sky. I hope that was not true. And indeed, it turned out to be a falsehood for which those responsible were tethered to a cement block on the village green and beaten with Kegels. old farmer frack rented out the candles himself, which showed yet another side to this surprisingly kaleidoscopic, mad old man. It remained the case, however, that no one had seen hide nor hair nor twig of the woman of twigs for weeks, where she dwelt had always been an unfathomable mystery. So it was not a simple case of bashing her door down and clamping a bleep around her ankle, as we would normally do with aged solitaries. Still, crouched in the field listening to the pneumatic radio blaring and crackling from old farmer fracks cart. It was good to hear her voice. I was unfamiliar with the legend of the Golden pig, and I thank my lucky stars that I was not told it when I was tiny, for it is without doubt the most absolutely terrifying story I have ever heard.

Here are a couple of excerpts from a new book by the poet Dennis beer pint in a thicket with a compass, I am thinking about blubber. I use blubber for my candles. I'm the captain of a whaler. Some use tallow. I use blubber. It gets smoky in my cabin. I'm not in my cabin. Now. As I said, I'm in a thicket. I'm on surely for a fortnight I've been hiking with the devil. Satan left me in a thicket on the wild and windy malls, but I've got my trusty compass and my pipe clamped in my drawers. I am smoking in the thicket. I hope to see my whaler soon. Don't go hiking with the devil. Keep your compass in your pocket. I am thinking about blubber. blubber is my candle light. It's a comfort in this thicket on the wild and windy malls to think of Bulava candlelight, for the devil trapped me in this thicket, and it is a pitch black night. And the second piece is simply an extract a very brief extract. Ah, but look, the stricken ship has been abandoned by its crew that puddings had been over egged and they all fell into the sea. And now they were swallowed up each one and fed the monsters of the deep. Now Not a trace of them remains except bones strewn on the ocean floor and they're stricken ship above, pecked at by indifferent orcs. And those two pieces were from the contaminated eggy pudding eaten by incautious sailors and other maritime tragedies by Dennis bear pint. Whether the phrase the wild and windy Moore's is copyright Kate Bush, I'm not entirely sure. And another book, currently in preparation is the hooting yard treasury of recondite yet somehow arresting facts. After much salt in a bowl of Mrs. gubbins delicious soup. We decided to use a simple question and answer format for this mighty undertaking. And here's a sneak preview of one question and answer specially for listeners. Question Ayn Rand, the gravel voiced and Dementedly right wing author of such pap as the fountainhead 1943 and atlas shrugged. 1957 was as we know, a keen collector of postage stamps. But what I really want to know is the title of the song played at her funeral service in 1982. I know that this is not phrased as a question, but bear with me. Answer the song played at Ayn Rand's funeral in 1982 was, it's a long way to Tipperary.

For many years, Dobson worked intermittently as a taxonomy of crushed things and squashed things. He kept two notebooks one with a blue cover on which squashed was written in big black bold capitals, and one with a yellow cover, onto which he stuck a dymo tape strip punched out with the word crushed. Asked once by the spectacle devotee if there was any significance in the blue and yellow coloring of the notebook covers, Dobson's reply was drowned out by the screeching of a flock of limits. Owner for logical only theologically alert listeners will say, Boy, hang on limits don't screech. And they would of course be correct. But the limits in question were rare screeching limits a flock of which Dobson had corralled in an annex to the room in which he granted an interview to the bespectacled devotee in Winnipeg, or a suburb thereof. It is important to be precise about these things. Had the rare screeching linnets not screeched the bespectacled devotee would nevertheless have been disappointed by Dobson's reply. For the color coding of his crushed and squashed taxonomy notebooks was the sort of thing that pamphleteer preferred to keep under his hat. I can reveal however, that when he bought the notebooks Dobson was under the spell of the color symbolism theories of faffing tin Herne Bay, Herne Hill, and Hoon, were the places faffing often trod, though, which one was the site of his breakthrough discovery is not known. But in neither the hearns nor Hoon, does he have any commemorative plaque? Probably because his theories have been utterly discredited. If Farrington is remembered at all, aside from Dobson short lived championing of him, it is as a deluded moto maniac. He insisted on publishing his magnum opus in a stodgy German translation, thinking that this would give it more heft with Beatle brown intellectuals having no German Dobson had the ludicrously dense and lengthy text English for him by a distressed polyglot He met on a sandbank that polyglot was grubbing for worms, while Dobson had got lost on his way to the post office. Dobson had something of a knack for finding himself on sand banks in tar pits, or stranded in drainage ditches without ever knowing quite how he got there. marigold Chu had suggested that he get himself a pair of shoes with a compass concealed in the heel, such as were once worn by venturesome tinies but the pamphleteer was far too fond of his padded Bulgarian Security Police hiking boots to contemplate a change of footwear. In any case, it was one of Dobson's physical peculiarities that he that he admitted violent magnetic discharges, so that campuses in his vicinity went wildly spinning. By all accounts faffing tend to was subject to anomalous magnetic phenomena. Although it is mere myth that the popular cartoon character magnet boy, the boy magnet was based on him. During the period if his infatuation with the muddle headed color symbolist Dobson considered writing a potted biography of Farrington, but found facts hard to come by. After a fortnight of tough and grizzled research, all he could say for certain was that fast things and had an extremely large head. Hatters were known to have balked at his approach, and more than one practicing phrenologist had been driven to Fitz and vapors when attending to him. That much gave Dobson about half a page of material, not nearly enough for a pamphlet, however potted it might be. He scrunched up the page on which he had jotted his notes and tossed it into a canal, an act of wanton littering, which earned him withering looks from the lock keeper for the next 20 years. The lock keeper by coincidence, was the brother of the distressed polyglot Dobson encountered on that sandbank in infancy. They had been briefly famous as a variety theatre act known as the diminutive cavorting brothers, the future lock keeper cavorted

sideways, and he who would a polyglot be cavorted up and down. They earned a small fortune before the elder one was six years old. But every penny was frittered away by their near do well parents, a pair of rascals who came to a deservedly sticky end. polyglot lock keeper drifted apart in their teenage years, and were completely estranged. By the time Dobson employed the one and disgruntled the other. Had Dobson carried out a bit more research on the subject of his abandoned potted biography. He would have learned that faffing tin also had a sibling from whom he was estranged. His sister was by turns a flapper, a blue stocking an Aviatrix and the president of a small Republic recovering bauxite and tin, and she was portrayed on film by both Mabel Normand and Constance Binney Dotson was watching the hoofing of a horse in a blacksmith yard one Wednesday morning, when an anvil toppled from its temporary hoist, weakened by rainwater, and fell into the mud, crushing an encampment of golden back Beatles. It was this incident which led his interest in crushed things and squashed things, the project to create a proper taxonomy of which remained incomplete at his death.

Finally, this week, I'm going to talk to you at you about wisps and clumps. gaining an insight into wisps and clumps will not give you a complete understanding of the physical universe in all its matchless wonder, but it's a start. Indeed, I can think of few subjects which prove a better introduction. Some might talk to you of toads or gazelles or coconut matting, or a strange irrefragable lights in the maritime skies. But I speak to wisps and clumps with occasional forays into the world of bees. So then, what is it Wisp and what is a clump? We shall look at each in turn. A Wisp might be made of smoke or some other fume, for there are countless fumes, gaseous and otherwise. One guaranteed way of seeing a whisk with your very own eyes is to stand next to a dying bonfire. If you don't stand there too early, while the bonfire is still blazing, perhaps with an effigy of Roman Catholic martyr Guy Fawkes engulfed in the flames, you will not be able to see any wisps or much else because the Smoke will be billowing, making your eyes water. And if some scamp has placed any noxious substances on the bottom bonfire, such as anything made of rubber or plastic, things will be even worse. And you may feel like choking. Indeed, you may even choke uncontrollably and toppled to the ground, helpless, helpless, helpless, as Crosby, Stills Nash and young will want to sing long ago on the west coast of America. They say that David Crosby's mustache has to be preserved as a national monument. But I digress. Basically, what I'm saying is keep away from the bonfire will it while it's at its height, you want to go and stand next to it. As the last embers are dying for it. It's then that you will be able to see wisps of smoke, what are their characteristics, these wisps? They are light, delicate and fugitive, you will see a Wisp rising from the glowing ashes and it will slink upon the breeze for a few moments, and then it will be gone. All that is solid melts into air, according to Marx and Engels in the manifesto of the Communist Party 1848. And this is certainly true of wisps which are hardly solid in the first place. Some substances take longer to melt into air than others of course, and this brings us neatly to clumps. clumps can be made of all sorts of things and for the moment I want you to direct your attention to clumps of earth or soil or mud. Such clumps are often called clods, particularly by the visionary poet William Blake, who wrote the cloth on the pebble. But I'm sticking with clumps for the purpose of this diverting talk. At least I hope it's diverting. Now there you are standing next to the bonfire while it blazed having arrived far too early for the wisps. And your eyes was streaming with tears, and you were coughing and choking, helplessly, remember, and the next thing that happened was that you toppled over and fell to the ground, perhaps even rolling into a nearby ditch. Let us assume you're sprawled there on your front face down in the muck. At some point in the next few minutes, the effects of smoke inhalation wear off and you open your stinging eyes. Chances are that the first thing you will see there in the ditch is a clump of Earth. One glance at it should be enough to show you that it will take longer to melt into air than a Wisp but melts into air it shall one day as all solid things do.

Frank Key  28:23
We examine the characteristics of the Wisp so we ought to do the same with the clump. But I have to say that I'm reluctant to do so. I think it's worth celebrating the ephemeral and fugitive nature of wisps, much as one admires clouds or falls of snow, or the all too brief life of a bee. But a clump is just a clump, really a clump or clawed fit out to be kicked or squashed underfoot, crushed beneath the mighty boots of history. Well, I do hope that you've gained a valuable insight into both wisps and clumps if you wish to do any further reading, don't bother with the King James Bible the Authorized Version, as neither wisps nor clumps are mentioned in it strangely enough, you might find a richer Trove in Dobson's pamphlet, a pamphlet about wisps and clumps with Dr. plagiarize shamelessly in this talk.

That's the end of hooting out on the air. For this week. I'll leave you with a quote from Isaac tree breaks, who wrote in epilepsy history and neurasthenia. In bygone days the world was a peaceful place in which our full Fathers knew not the blessings of bile beans. They were sound trench women who called their few ailments humors or vapors and knew what peace of mind meant. 60 years ago, there was one lunar ticking every 600 people. Today there is one in every 200 arithmetically precise. Certainly. That's it then I'll be back next week. Bye bye
