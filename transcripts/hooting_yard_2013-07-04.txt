Hello, hooting yard listeners. This is hooting yard on resonance 104 point four f n resonance fm.com. Or the resonance thing on Soundcloud or even a podcast many moons in the future. Whichever way you're listening, it doesn't make any difference because I'm still Frank Kay, and I'm still going to read to you for approximately 27 and a half to 28 minutes. And the first thing I'm going to read to you today is about picknick. Panic. psychiatrist friend ologists and other brain doctors have identified a common mind malaise known as picnic panic. This distressing condition afflict picnickers who fly into a panic when picnicking, it can be terribly, terribly debilitating, and ruins many and otherwise splendid bucolic picnicking, it will consider the following case study, Ned be a hale and hearty, mustachioed jolly type of fellow fond of rubbing boats and birds slaughter was exactly the type of person you might find attending a picnic in the 1930s and attend several picnics he did. At each one However, he fell victim to picnic panic, the panic increasing in severity, to the point where at his final picnic, he ran screaming into a nearby forest, and was found weeks later a gibbering maniac beyond all hope of redemption. He was confined to an asylum for the hopelessly bewildered until 1963. Upon his release, nade B was found accommodation in a dilapidated seaside resort, far from the field where once he had picnicked, a carer was appointed a retired a Aviatrix named Mavis hand basin, a very sensible woman with impeccable references. Among other responsibilities, she was charged with ensuring that never be never consumed a single crumb of food, nor some Earth of drink went out of doors. It was thought with good reason that if ever he did so, traumatic memories of picnics past might well might well up in his brain and lead to further calamity. For this reason, too, he was kept away from all kinds of rugs and blankets, even when indoors. For several years all was well. Ned be passed his days happily enough in standard dilapidated seaside resort fashion. He was even known to chuckle occasionally, at some amusement or other. He began a stamp collection and adopted a pudding base in the hairstyle. He often dreamed of slaughtering seagulls, but they were only dreams. It was not thought advisable to allow him a firearm

in the summer of 1968, however, during the third phase of the Tet Offensive, disaster struck that good woman may this hand basin arrived one morning at nade, B's a squalid sea front boarding house to find him gone. On the wall of his kitchenette, scrawled in bright red crayon, the color of blood, with the letters p i c n, followed by a long mad vertical line trailing off down towards the wainscot. It's almost certainly been intended. As a second letter I made this hand basin intuited the ghost of a final letter C. And her head began to spin. Somehow, something had inserted the idea of picnics into Nabis pour shattered brain She must find him before he did himself a mystery, or caused mayhem and havoc. She found him soon enough. There he was, upon the pebbly beach just yards from his door. He was sat upon a raincoat he had spread out upon the pebbles in invitation of a picnic blanket in a field. He was eating a sausage actually approached May this hand basin saw that his eyes were glazed, and his countenance stuck in a Rictus of terror is putting bass and haircut was in a state of the art of most disheveled ailment. His flesh was the color of curd myth hand basin was neither a psychiatrist nor a phrenologist nor any kind of brain doctor battery had been awarded a certificate of attendance at the module of a training course designed to teach amateurs to recognize the telltale signs of picnic panic, looking at need be on the beach with a sausage on that summer's day. She thought she had never in her life seen a more vivid exemplar of the malady and actually looked, the ones hale and hearty, mustachioed jolly fellow, now reduced to a wreck swallowed the last bit of sausage. He began to flap his arms desperately, his head up tilted, mad eyes gazing at the sky. His carer knew all too well what this meant. panicked by his impromptu picnic, neg bs wildbrain told him to flee, and he was trying to flee by flying. He was turning into a seagull. She took from it sling her mannlicher carcano snipers rifle, cocked it aimed and shot him dead, such as the instructive case of named B. It's important to note, however, that not all authorities agree that death by sniper's bullet is the inevitable outcome in every case of picnic panic. Mistakes were made, in this case, not least allowing netherby simultaneous access to a beak, a raincoat, and a sausage. One, or even two of those he could have coped with perhaps, is carefully monitored. It was the combination of all three that proved fatal. And the source of that piece was the terrifically exciting doings of Mavis hand basin, Episode 43. First published in Miss blossom partridges weekly digest, volume 33. Number seven. No author is given, and it's thought the doings are a thinly disguised autobiography penned by Mavis hand base in herself from her attic room in an asylum for the hopelessly bewildered, perched on a hillside on the outskirts of pointy town. Visitors report that mishandled bass and enjoys weekly picnics in all weathers, and there's never shown the slightest sign of picnic panic.

Panic is a sort of theme for the show today, or for at least the first two items. This is about my panic button. When she observed that I was boggle eyed and twitching and panting I explained to my lifestyle coach that I suffered from debilitating panic attacks. By the way, if you don't have a lifestyle coach, I strongly recommend that you acquire one. Mine is peculiarly expensive, but I think some come at a discount. I can say without fear of contradiction. Since hiring my lifestyle coach, I have become a butterfly where once I was a caterpillar, I fly where Once I crawled Actually, it's not true to say that with to say that without fear of contradiction, plenty of people will line up to contradict me to charge that I'm more closely resemble a creature crawling upon its belly upon the earth. Hence my panic attacks. What you need said my lifestyle coach is a panic button. Happily, she had a box full of such buttons in her desk drawer and sold one to me there and then it was peculiarly expensive for a button and there was no discount available. When I got home, I sewed the button onto my jacket roughly in the vicinity of my heart. The idea was that whenever I felt a panic attack coming upon me, I should clap shut the button desperately. to revert the risk of ripping the button loose in my desperation, I sewed it on using a good deal of extremely strong thread. As my lifestyle coach advised. I need hardly add that the jacket to which I chose to affect my panic button was a Tyrolean sports casual cut, similar to the jacket worn by Christopher Plummer in the sound of music, Robert Wise 1965 It's my jacket do jaw, every jaw. Now, it's a curious fact that many people think they know much about buttons without really knowing the first thing about them. To the untrained eye for example, my panic button looked like a stray button inexplicably sewn onto my jacket, more or less over where my heart was pounding like a steam hammer. The button ignorant might posit the slapback handiwork of a myopic or distracted mistress that's prancing along the boulevard in the autumnal sunshine. For the first time since a fixing my panic button. I was emotionally prepared for the barrage of cat calls and brickbat. I was shorter receive, if and when an urchin pointed at my heart and shouted, or a Mr. You've got a stray button there on your Tyrolean sports casual jacket. Looks like it was sewn on by a half blind sent strength. I would not need to clagett my button in desperation to stave off a panic attack. Already, it seems to be working its magic, helping to keep a sense of gibbering terror welling up and undoing me. As it happened on that first outing with the panic button. I had no cause to clap jacket at all. It was as if with the reassurance of its presence. All the usual prods to my panic vanished. luring clouds misaligned paving slabs yapping puppies. bookshop window displays piled high with Jeanette Winterson paperbacks were usually I would shriek and stagger bog allied and twittering and panting through the street. I was a picture of calmness and insouciance. I may even have essayed a whistle, a trophy Koon half remembered from a childhood Jambo re on the corner of Ringo Starr Street and aerobus and Tara muse, I bumped unexpectedly into my lifestyle coach. She was sitting on a bench feeding birds with stale bread from a greaseproof paper bag. I have to say, I had to say, this panic button you sold me is worth every penny. I've been out and about now for 10 minutes, and not once have I felt even the merest pang of panic. I have not had to clap jacket in desperation once she turned her head to look at me. And there was an eerie cast to her countenance.

feed the birds tapping a bag, tapping, tapping, tapping the bag, she said. I've looked at her more closely and realize she was not my lifestyle coach after all, or if she was, she had aged by several decades since I saw her the day before. I felt a sudden tremor of fear. See the birds tapping a bag tapping, tapping, tapping so bag, she said again, gazing straight into my eyes with a look I could now see was a hideous admixture of others. amusement and fathomless malevolence. birds were swooping around the scene teaming profusion crows and linnets and sparrows and starlings and Tippi Hedren and P width. Instinctively, I knew the moment had come to cut cut my panic button. But as I raised my hand towards my heart, where the button glittered on my Tyrolean sports casual jacket, one of the birds swooped in and picked it clean away. I had used extremely strong thread, but it was no match for the sharp savage beak of the crow. The bird flew up and up, carrying my panic button the way into the sky, the sky Where I ought to have been fluttering like a butterfly. Instead, in my panic, I tottered and fell to the ground upon misaligned paving slabs down on my belly like a caterpillar. I clutched at the strand of broken thread where my button had been my lifestyle coach or the aged Biddy, who had taken her place, stood up from the bench and crawled upon the small of my back as she shambled away with her. Now empty greaseproof paper bag. The luring clouds broke, and a deluge poured down upon me. I was unbuttoned and undone.

So hot was the consulting room of Dr. pindrop that you could hear a pin drop. Plus, at the moment I dropped a pin. I coughed loudly to camouflage the ping of its landing on the linoleum. Now, all I had to do was wait for Dr. pindrop to come in. I whistled an approximation of the song of the mask Shrike. lanius new because getting into character's Flight Lieutenant Colin blinds are if portrayed by Donald Pleasance, in the greatest scape. JOHN Sturges 1963 when Dr. pindrop entered, he would be in the role of flight left Tennant. Robert Henry DFC is played in the film by James Garner. We would enact, albeit imperfectly, the poignant scene where it becomes apparent that blind is virtually blind. What would the eyestrain brought on by all that diligent counterfeiting of papers and passports and documentation and what have you. But when Dr. pindrop pushed open the door and entered his consulting room, I saw that something was up. Unlike blinds, my vision was not occluded. Indeed, it was so piercing that I could count each individual Ferro on the troubled brow of Dr. pindrop. Though I was waiting at the far end of the room. I'm so sorry, blood veg, said Dr. pindrop. Something has come up and I have no time to take part in our reenactment of a classic film scene. What's the matter? I asked? Oh, you need not worry your odd shaped little head about the Titanic responsibilities of an important physician. He said, suffice to say, I shall be spending the rest of the day applying probe to the brains of guinea pigs. I can claim that this left me at something of a loose end. Just when I had entered what I think of as the zone in that zone. I was Donald Pleasance, or Colin blinds or some exquisite amalgam of the two. I understand your concern, said Dr. pindrop. In that mollifying tone he usually employs at the bedside of the stricken. But listen, out there in the waiting room are all my guinea pigs sitting quietly, you could deliver blinds ornithology lecture from earlier in the film and whistle the song of the mask Shrike lanius new beakers, two guinea pigs. I asked a ghast They are human guinea pigs you nitwit, said Dr. pindrop. I had to admit that this was a splendid idea. And it meant that my intellectual and emotional straining to become Donald Pleasance stroke, Colin blind would not go to waste. Before you go, said Dr. pindrop, pick up that pin you dropped earlier, would you? As I went to retrieve it, he stuck out his leg and tripped me over. We had enacted the classic film scene, albeit in perfectly after all. thrilled with my performance, and still in character, I went out into the waiting room to tell were human guinea pigs about birds, and to whistle the sound of the mosque Shrike, lanius new backers. But the human guinea pig were no longer sitting quietly. They had been corralled into a corner of the waiting room by Dr. Pin drops receptionist, Mrs. Crease frog, who was toting a submachine gun. It took me a matter of moments to realize that she was in the zone as Hans Gruber, the criminal mastermind from diehard john mcternan 1988. Play by Alan Rickman. Mrs. Crease frog, I cried. I had no idea you two were a member of the classic action film scene reenactment society. She fired a burst of ammo into the ceiling and looked at me and looked me over. Nice suit. She said john Phillips, London. I have to myself. Rumor has it arafat buys his there.

Frank Key  21:56
Gosh, she really was in the zone. I had to think fast. This was no scene for Donald Pleasance. on the spur of the moment. I decided to shift character to one of Hans Gruber's team of ruthless criminals. And I ran and crashed through the plate glass window of Dr. Pin drops waiting room, plummeting several stories before landing with a terrific thump on a police car parked below. shattering the windscreen. Hello, I said to the startled driver. You must be Sergeant our power played by Reginald Vel Johnson. I rubbed my eyes to dislodge a fragment of the shattered windscreen. Can I help you said the driver? Oh no, please. It's only something in my eye. I said. Please let me look. I happen to be a doctor. He said and I realized he was the general secretary of the classic romantic film scene reenactment society. He was not Sergeant our power from diehard. He was in the zone as Dr. Alec Harvey, played by Trevor Howard in brief encounter. David lean 1945 It took all my thespian skills to slack off in an instant. Both Colin blys and a member of a German criminal gang. Oh, why must we be so withdrawn and shy and difficult? I said the sun was shining on the nothing new

before I read the final piece on this week's show. Just a reminder to visit the hooting yard website hooting yard.org and they will find everything I ever read on the show. It now goes back about nine and a half years the the 10th birthday of the website comes up in December. I think it's December December later this year will be the website's 10th anniversary at a vast archive that would probably keep you busy. Were you to read everything on it for well, quite a long time. But I recommend sometimes that can be quite useful to do that to devote several months or years of your life to reading everything on the hooting yard website in chronological order. Order extremely useful way to spend your time. So do go to the website. And while you're there, you may would like to press the little PayPal button and send me some money. I look forward to receiving it. Thank you very much in advance. Anyway, finally this week I went for a stroll around grim and Maya in my pocket, adult made of wax. I paused by a tasik during a break in the rain. I smoked a cigarette and thought about Paavo Nurmi, the flying fin. It occurred to me that if ever I tried to run as far as fast as him, I would, I would almost certainly collapse from exhaustion. grinding the butt of my cigarette into the muck. I took the doll from my pocket. From another pocket I took a batch of pins, spatters of rains started up again. I adjusted my homberg on my head as best I could with the doll in one hand and the pins in the other. It was my intention to pierce the doll with the pins, while jabbering curses. I think it's best that I do not divulge the name of the curse see. In any case, it hardly matters because in the end, I did not carry out my plan. I cast the doll into the mire and drop the pins in the muck by the Mayas edge. Then I turned on my heel and sprinted. Yes, sprinted back towards my shabby hotel room in the town. But long before I reached it, just yards away from the mire. I collapsed from exhaustion. Unlike Paavo Nurmi, I had no idea how to pace myself. I am no flying Finn, nor was meant to be. I sprawl bear in the muck and the rain fell down on me. I let it fall. What could I have done to stop it? I have no power over the weather. He who might had been on the point of cursing, oh, now he has such a power. But the day will come perhaps when he will have egg on his face. I am too tired to care. I've run out of steam. I fear that as dusk falls grew, some creatures will crawl from grim and Maya grabbed me by the ankles and drag me under. So be it.
