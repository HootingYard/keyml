Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. The umpteenth edition of the show, and I'll be reading to you again. More than 20 years ago, I wrote a short piece in which I described being hunched among shimmer rings. Looking back, it occurs to me that I didn't really know what I was talking about. I was just blathering. I often blathered in those days, both vocally and when doing my scribblings. I think I was simply unclear about what I wanted to say. much has changed though. For now I have a clear eagle eyed vision and I'm somewhat better able to communicate it. I still fall prey to blather more often than I ought to. But I've learned to nip it if not in the bud. Then before too many tendrils have swarmed across the sun dappled pathway that leads to truth and beauty and insight. You see, there really is a bright two Magnificent uppland upon which we can prompt if we can but reach it. I know that now. So when 20 odd years ago, I wrote about hunching among the shimmer rings, I was unable to do much more than to simply report the fact the significance of my experience escaped me. But last week, I found myself once again so hunched among shimmering and now I'm equal to the task of writing about it properly. It was Tuesday morning, and I was exhausted after a sleepless night, fueled by vimto and boil in the bag liquidized macaroni. I've been sitting up studying the flight patterns of bitterns and sanderlings to prepare myself for a bird related q&a session I was due to attend. There are many such calls on my attention, and I usually decline them, but this one was a fundraiser for a cause close to my heart. So I was taking part. If I could help to raise a pittance for the toward grip, tracksuit Museum, I was ready to immerse myself in bird flight patterns for as long as it took. And if truth be told, I found the subject fascinating. But by the time Tuesday dawned, my poor brain Panzer turned to mush, and I needed some fresh air. Not far from where I live beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing, there is the shock of a mystic. I'm in no doubt that like most mystics, the mystic who dwells in the shack is a fraud. Like TV psychologist, Dr. Raj pisode. He's an incorrigible plagiarist, calling his mystic pronouncements from other mystics, some of whom live like him in shacks by level crossings, some of whom live in palaces, and some of whom are dead. Yeah, I often find it refreshing to head out at dawn and to bistre him by throwing pebbles at a shack, that at any rate was my plan. I filled my pockets with pebbles from my pebble pot, and studied out of the house, stamping my feet with vigor upon the green earth. I do not mean that the earth upon which I thumped was literally green. I'm trying to impress upon you that I am attuned to nature, a true friend of the earth, a sort of pebble throwing version of Jonathan pirate. It's true that I don't care to pins about my carbon footprint. And perhaps that's why I don't get to jet round the world in gleaming aircraft to attend conferences on global warming. But I don't complain. I have my little baileywick and I trudge the green earth, hugging the occasional Sycamore or yew tree, when to do so takes my fancy. On this particular morning, though, I didn't stop to commune with any trees. I was fired up and in a hurry, and I whistled as I made my way past the weird caves and the duck pond and the industrial funnel manufacturing compound and select skis, gazebo, and the enormous cruncher and the two different statues of Condoleezza Rice towards the shack of the mystic beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level Crossing. I'm no expert Whistler by any means, but I am enthusiastic. annoyingly so. And as I walked, I whistled existential by pragmatic from their 1978 debut EP. It suited my mood.

Frank Key  05:19
So there I was purposeful and full of them. Yet within 10 minutes I was hunched among shimmer rings, my pockets empty of pebbles and my teeth chattering. I wish I could tell you how it happened, but I cannot. The eerie shimmer innings engulf me with terrible suddenness, I sank to the ground, the pebbles in my pockets somehow dissolved or vanished as if they'd never been there at all. The air grew cold, then hot, I hunched there defenseless, a tiny blob in a vast universe of shimmer rings. this had happened to me before two decades ago, as I mentioned, back then I wrote, hunched among the shimmer rings. Forget what I just said. Forget what I just said.

Frank Key  06:33
I had hoped to play with a bit of existential but pragmatic, but I forgot to bring my copy with me to the studio. Never mind, maybe some other time, a special treat now. Every now and then on the show. As you know, I read things that were written by people other than myself. I can't actually tell you who wrote what I'm about to read because the author is anonymous. It's an 1831 book published by Sydney's press, in New Haven in the United States, and it's called the book of accidents designed for young children. I think the book is designed for young children rather than the activists, but it's full of cautionary tales. And well, here's the author's preface. in presenting to his little readers the book of accidents, the author conceives he cannot render a more important service to the rising generation and to parents, than by furnishing them with an account of the accidents to which children from their inexperience or carelessness are liable. If generally studied, it will save the lives of thousands and relieve many families from the long and unavailing misery attendant on such occurrences. And so there are a number of accidents or potential accidents covered in the book, which is full of extremely wonderful prose. So, I'm going to read the whole thing to you now. Just bear in mind that each each little paragraph is in the book is illustrated with a with a engraving or woodcut. So those are referred to you'll just have to imagine them. If you go to the hooting yard website, www dot hooting yard.org You can find an entry from yesterday, I think, for the book of accidents designed for young children. And there's a link there to the entire book online. Some some library. So here it is the book of accidents designed for young children playing with horses. Horses are very dangerous, but most useful animals to be kicked by them is almost certain death, and children often play about them and go near their heels without being sensible of their danger. In the engraving, we see a little innocent, who had been engaged in gathering lots of fresh grass and giving them to her paws horse. After employing herself in this way for some time. She carelessly took hold of his tail, unconscious of the danger that she was in until a horse by a kick of one leg laid her lifeless on the ground. crossing streets. careless children, in spite of warning often run across the street when carts and carriages are near and are knocked down and run over. Children have been so very careless at times, that it appeared as if they wanted to see how near they could get to carriages and not be run over. Here is a miserable Little girl who attempted to cross the street as a cart man was passing with a heavy load. The horse has knocked her down, and she now lives under the wheel, where she will be crushed to death in spite of the efforts of the man to stop his horse. Children should be particularly careful when crossing the street in winter, as slaves are then running to and fro with great rapidity and sometimes being without jingles. The little boys and girls know not their approach until they're dangerous stares them in the face and escape is impossible. Children should always cross the street after the characters have passed. Worrying dogs

Frank Key  10:49
many children delight in teasing dogs, and without caution go to near them by which they get miserably torn and mangled. Wicked boys sometimes hold a piece of meat towards the dogs, and as they approach with demonstrations of joy in hopes of receiving it, they suddenly take it away. By repeating this, the dogs become enraged, and often severely repay them for their trickiness. What these boys had been doing to enrage the dog we cannot tell but suspect they had been tormenting him in some way, thinking that as he was chained, he could not injure them. But they were mistaken in this, and one of them is likely to be bitten very severely. Dogs are celebrated for their sagacity, and their attachment to man. And many instances are they're recorded of their having saved the lives of their masters. But all dogs are not of this description, Samar cross and ferocious, barking and biting at all who come near them. Playing with candles. Here we see the danger of playing with lighted candles. One little girl has set the bed curtains on fire and the other her hair and both are in great danger of being burnt to death unless someone grants and speedy assistance learn from this never to play with candles. Perhaps the little girl who has set the curtains on fire was reading in a book after she had retired to rest. The practice of doing this ought to be forbidden by every parent that has occasion the destruction of many nice houses and the loss of many precious lives. The other little girl was probably walking across the room in a rapid manner and the light coming in contact with her curly hair. It blazed up like a flash of powder. Unless she is possessed of great presence of mind. It will communicate to her ruffles and then to her lower close, I hope she will not attempt to run for that would make it blaze still more furiously scalded at the table. Little children who can just reach to the top of a table often endeavor to drink from the spout of a tea pot, and in consequence school their mouths and throats and die miserable death in a few hours. Some have even been so thoughtless as to drink out of the spat of a tea kettle and have instantly been scalded to death in great torments. Here in the picture are two little girls around a tea table. children as young these appear to be should never come to the table unless attended by some older persons to wait upon them. Very likely, these two little girls thought they would have a fine time all by themselves, but only see how badly they perform the honors of the table. They are both standing up and one of them is using her little Patty to obtain a lump of sugar when she should make use of the tongs that are in the bowl. The other in attempting to pour out a cup of hot tea, poured it upon her little bosom and scolded herself very severely

tossed by a bull. The bull is a noble looking but ferocious and terrible creature and when provoked, he assumes the air of swollen majesty and often tears up the ground with his feet and horns. They should be carefully avoided and never be teased by children. These two boys has been seen taking a short walk and we're crossing the fields together when they were pursued and one of them overtaken by the ferocious animal. After taking the poor boy on his horns, he tossed him high into the air and catching him as he fell, tossed him up again and thus continue to do until left for dead. The other boy for escaped from the enraged animal and arrived home very late in the evening, panting and almost exhausted. He had a doleful story indeed to relate to his parents, and often would be what he assembled together his young friends and companions, and entertain them in giving an account of the ill fate of his comrade and of his own narrow escape. Riding a wild horse many little boys lose their lives by getting on their paws horses. They're lightweight encourages the animals are frisky and Gallop, and the child becoming terrified, falls off his feet dragging the stirrups, and he is kicked or otherwise dashed to pieces. In the picture before us, we have a lad who set out on horseback in company with a number of others to attend a military parade. As he drew near the troops, the splendor of their equipment and the sound of the drums and fives, so alarmed his horse, that he commenced prancing and galloping about so furiously, that his young master soon lost all command over him. When the horse perceive this, he by one desperate spring through the boy from his back, and bent his way homeward with the fleetness of a deer. Horses are very useful to man as beasts of burden, and sometimes become so attached to an affectionate master that they will come at his call and follow him wherever he wishes.

And so we continue with the book of accidents designed for young children, playing with knives. Nothing is so foolish and dangerous as to play with knives, scissors and forks. Bad wounds are often the consequence, and many children have lost lost their lives. Here is a little boy who has had his hand half cut off by the carelessness of his little sister. They went forth into the fields with very sharp knives to gather flowers, and to cut bows for the purpose of decorating their rooms. As they were cutting down a very large one, the little girl's knife slipped, stuck, struck her brother's hand and made an incision to the bone. The blood flowed copiously, the boy cried heartily. And all this happened for want of proper care on the part of the little girl. Children sometimes procure very sharp knives which they carry about with them in their pocket, and to test the sharpness of them. They are often cutting cares desks and tables, and wiggling about the house, much against their parents wishes to their own danger and to the annoyance of the housemaid. Playing with firearms. No child should touch a gun or pistol or any account present one as another person we behold a little boy shooting his sister dead. An accident that too often occurs for want of warning, guns and pistols of every description a very dangerous, especially in the hands of young persons. Children often get their little heads together, procure a small cannon and some powder and go forth to some unfrequented place and spend hours in firing it off. This is a very dangerous amusement, and we would recommend them to pursue such as are attended with less danger, for it often happens that the powder explodes in their hands. The cannon bursts or goes off when they do not expected and they thus have their faces, hands and clothes burned in a most shocking manner. Parents should dissuade their children from such dangerous amusements, furnish them with books that will give a taste for learning and encourage them in virtuous habits. Playing with fire in the absence of parents giddy children often like paper in the fire and play with it. And here we behold a little girl, burning a large sheet by her thoughtlessness in doing this and by approaching to near the great her clothes have taken fire. For him the attention which he is paying to the burning paper. She does not see that her apron is fast burning up or Her sister is calling loudly to her and endeavouring to warn her of her danger. But poor girl, she hides it not. Some parents who have left their children alone in the house while they went on a visit, they've had their ears assailed by the cry of fire, on returning home, arrived only in time to see their house in flames. And here's a shrieks of their children without being able to grant them relief. When children's clothes take fire, they should not run about but should immediately lay down on the floor and roll and thus extinguish the flames. Throwing stones, wicked and malicious boys often throw stones by which they not only hurt and main one another, but often knockout and I and a disfigured for life. What a sight is this, we see that one has already received a severe bruise on the face and is crying in a most doleful manner as the blood gushes from the wound. What a delight they appear to take in hurling the rocky missiles at the wounded boy, What a sight it will be to his parents to see their son come crying home, with his face covered with clotted blood. If such conduct is so wicked in the sight of men, how much more so must it be in the sight of him who see if not as man CF. In winter, the children of one school sometimes challenge those of another to combat, having provided themselves with an abundance of snow and ice balls and arrayed themselves in order for battle. The contest is commenced and carried on with great desperation, each one aiming to injure his antagonist. Excuse me, falling out of a coach. Here we see an accident of a serious nature,

Frank Key  21:59
a little girl falling out of the door of a coach. This little girl is truly in a most dangerous situation. Although the horses are going at a very moderate pace. Should the driver happen to hear her cries, she may yet be saved. But if he does not, what a terrible death it may be her unfortunate lot to encounter the fastenings of coach doors and never to be depended upon, and children should never lean upon them or against them. The door flies open, they tumble out, the wheels go over them, and they are often killed on the spot. It is a great source of gratification to children to attend their parents when going to ride in a coach. As they leave the bustling scenes of the city and approach the neat residences of country people. All things appear new to them. They inhale the pure air gather the sweet flowers, and if no accident occurs, they return highly elated with their visit.

Boy drowning hundreds of poor boys and drowned every year from not being sensible as the danger of water. They go into ponds and rivers without knowing their depth, and by one fatal step they sink never to rise again. Boys should never bays but in baths made for the purpose or should be attended by those who can help them if necessary. Here we have a picture of two little boys who went out one afternoon to bathe. One of them ventured out too far. And we see him on the point of sinking, extending his arms towards his brother in hopes of being rescued from a watery grave. What sorrow rests upon his countenance, as he thinks of loving parents, kind friends and affectionate brothers and sisters. But we hope he will be saved and prove a useful member of society. Ah, a helping hand is near the strange position of his brother attracted the notice of a benevolent stranger who rushed into the water and save the drowning boy of the imminent risk of his own life. climbing on chairs. When little children first commenced creeping or walking about the room, they are continually contriving some new means of diversion. And one which they early discover is that a playing about cares and a great number of accidents happen to them by getting up on the back of chairs in which persons are sitting. The person gets up and the chair falls back on the poor child who gets badly hurt. And accident of this kind is here represented where the mother is seen just rising from a chair on which was standing her little daughter. How alarmed appears the parent she beholds the situation of the child. The next moment to have her pretty little head Brewer against the fender. Children should not climb about or stand on chairs. They were made to sit in. Little children have sometimes had made for them small chairs prettily painted, in which they take great delight to sit and rock. These are much better for them than the large ones, but they're not so liable to fall from them. Boys fighting, wicked boys fight like dogs and other brutes, by which they not only do each other great injury, but by such conduct a disgrace the human form and krisztian character. Here are seen two boys that shamefully engaged What a sight they present. Boys endowed with faculties capable of serving their Creator, and of planning means of each other's happiness, I hear seem wallowing in the mud and dirt and striving to do each other harm. Perhaps one of these boys has for an excuse that the other abused him and provoked him to such a degree that he could not endure it. Good children who happen to fall into the Society of bad boys should immediately avoid their company, suffer abuse rather than resent it, rendered good for evil. And by doing so they will put to shame their enemies and gain the victory. bears and lions we know sometimes growl and fight, but children, you should never be such angry. They're sorry, never let such angry passions rise. The print that on that part was very small. Onward, falling out of a window. How important that those who have the charge of children should be constant in our attendance on them, and ever only. On the alert, less some accident before them. They always have a great desire to get up on the window seats and look out and hundreds of children are killed every year by leaning out of Windows by overbalanced themselves, and then at the world all the world cannot save them. What feelings of pity run through as we behold the situation of this poor girl. In another moment, she may be dashed upon the rocky pavement below to be picked up by her parents a mangled corpse. What horror is depicted on her countenance if she looks forward to the impending ruin, but we hope that the calamity may be averted by the fortunate appearance of the chambermaid, in whose care she was left, and who criminally neglected her charge. And, finally troubling the cook. The little girl here is seen rushing forward to tell some idle tale, perhaps to the cook. unless she's very careful, she may stumble over the pot of water which is standing on the floor,

Frank Key  28:02
or be scalded by the water running from the dish which the cook is carrying to the table. Children should be aware of scalding water. They often run about a kitchen when the cook is preparing their dinner and get sadly burned or scalded. And sometimes they play with the tea kettle or tear in the parlor, and repent their folly by getting sadly scolded. The writer knows of a little boy who was very fond of being in the kitchen, that he might see how Johnny cakes and pies and all such things were made, and from his talkativeness occasionally considered trouble. In the absence of the cook for a short time, what should he do but go and sit himself down into a kettle of boiling hot water? He screams soon brought his mother and with difficulty, his life was saved.

Frank Key  29:14
So that was the book of accidents. In fact, there are two more just two more entries. We haven't got time for them, tumbling down stairs, and climbing trees. Maybe I'll read them to you next week. And lots of cautionary tales. I hope you found that useful. In these days of health and safety, you can never be too careful. I've had a bit of a sore throat. I've been coughing a bit. Hope you don't mind that. I'm sure you don't care, really. And yeah, I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
