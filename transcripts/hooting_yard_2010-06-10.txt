Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance dub that read www dot resonance fm.com. Or you might even be listening to a podcast I don't know. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read you for about half an hour. Just under that. Long term, listeners will know that here at hooting yard, we always try to bring you the best in morally uplifting prose. And I'd like to begin this week show with an extract from john Wesley's stories of boys and girls who love to the Savior. I'm not sure the date of this book or pamphlet. Interestingly, it's written in numbered paragraphs, also used by Ruskin in price. And I've occasionally used an either format I like I've occasionally used numbered paragraphs. Anyway, I'm not going to read you the whole bit, but I'll tell you which paragraph I'm reading. And this is one of john Wesley's stories of boys and girls who loved the Savior. Paragraph one, a very poor child of the parish of Newington, Butz was a very monster of wickedness and 1000 times more miserable and vile by his sin, than by his poverty. He was running to hell as fast as he could go, and was old in vice when he was but young in years, we scarcely hear of one, so like the devil in his infancy, as was this poor child. What sin was there that his age was capable of which he did not commit? What by the corruption of his nature and the abominable example of little beggar boys, he was indeed arrived at a great picture of impiety he would call names, take God's name in vain, curse, swear and do all kinds of mischief. And as to anything of God, he was worse than a heathen. Paragraph six. He was in grievous agonies of spirit, his former sins, stared him in the face and made him crumble. The poison of Gods arrows did even drink up his spirits. The sense of sin and of wrath was so great that he knew not what to do. The weight of God's displeasure, and the thought of lying under it to all eternity, broke him even to pieces, and he bitterly cried out, what shall I do? I am a miserable sinner, and I fear that I shall go to hell. his sins had been so great, and so many that there was no hope for him. Paragraph 14, the Wednesday before he died, he lay in a trance for about half an hour, in which time he thought he saw a vision of angels. Paragraph 16 he gave a kind of leap in his bed and snapped his finger and the thumb together with abundance of joy. And from that time forward in full joy and assurance of God's love, he continued earnestly praising God desiring to die and to be with Christ.

So I think the example we can take from that is to avoid where we can the abominable example of little Barrow boys, little beggar boys, sorry. And it's a little over three years since we learned that crouch is big threat says caca. If you want to look up the reference, go to the hooting yard website and put crouch in the search and you'll find a piece from 2007. Anyway, we learned as I say three years ago that crouches big threat says caca. Now things have taken a further turn. According to the paper the other day cacar might claim he is in shape, but Dongha is bound to be uneasy. There are two things of immediate note first cacar has gained an accent over his final a, although we're not told what he's done to deserve this. Secondly, the threat of credit Has not merely receded but vanished entirely supplanted by the uneasiness of dunga. dunga does not have an accent on his A, which may account in part for his nervousness. Foreigners it may be from envy of cars newly acquired accent, the obliterated crouch without an A to his name was never going to be accorded an accent. And in any case, at the time, he was considered a threat by cacar caca himself was accent plus. It may well be that the threat of crouch and the unease of dungar have nothing whatsoever to do with accents over A's. further work must be done before drawing a watertight conclusion. So what are we to make of cat cars claim to be in shape? It is surely pertinent that the shape itself goes I mentioned triangle or blonde dodecahedron or perhaps even near blob? This could be the true source of Dongers Arnie's dunga may also be wondering what happened to crouch Of course, three years ago, crouch was a big threat, or was at least perceived as such by caca as he was then and now he's nowhere to be seen. cacar Meanwhile, having clambered into or been ingested by an undefined shape. This would make any of us uneasy, so we ought not Tusk Tusk dungar for a wholly natural reaction, and we should mark well, that not only is dungar uneasy, he is bound to be uneasy, he has no choice in the matter, his uneasiness has been thrust upon him, whatever his feelings in the matter by this claim of cause, a claim made we take it from within a shape, a shape of what we know little, if anything, you are I would our warrant beyond easy, how much more so then Dongha, even without the vanished threat of crouch. These are deep matters to be sure, and there will no doubt be further developments in the coming weeks. We must do our best to keep abreast of them and treat them with the gravity they deserve.

News of Dobson now, a Dobson was a great one for Fern hunts. Although he was a pamphleteer decisively of the 20th century, he had about him something in the Victorian especially at certain periods of his life, such as the two decades or so he spent blasted out of his brain on laudanum, as well most Victorians most of the time, if some accounts are to be believed. I do recommend reading Matthew sweets book inventing the Victorians for further references to this glance than to give but one example regularly made speakers in the House of Commons with his head swimming in an open fog. It makes one wonder if we would be better governed today where the illiterate thickos in Parliament to have their brains ravaged and dangled a tad. In spite of his boundless ignorance of the natural world, or perhaps because of it, Dobson developed quite a taste for Fern hunting. In a memorable pamphlet, he described the attraction and I quote, hunting animals is the sport of fools. Nearly all animals run away when pursued. Firms, on the other hand, stay right where they are. So you can go crashing through thickets with much gusto, a determined drop to the jaw every so often admitting cries of panic or revelation, or both, all the while safe in the knowledge that your quarry is not dashing away over the field, vanishing over the horizon, leaving you and your band of fellow adventurers exhausted and stupid and empty handed. Dobson did not always grasp the point of an organized Fern hunt, however, and would arrive at the appointed gathering place armed with a net or a blunderbuss or sometimes with a geological hammer. It had to be patiently and repeatedly explained to him what a Fern was information. He had singular difficulty lodging in his skull, whether or not it was doused with laudanum in another paragraph at another time for example, he wrote this What better sports is there than chasing a wild Fern across the countryside watching it dash away over the field, vanishing over the horizon, leaving you and your band of fellow adventurers exhausted and happy and empty handed, but refreshed by bucolic air, panting, drugged up to the eyeballs and ready to go home and write dozens of pages of de Quincey and babble to his credit dogs and never made any attempt to suppress the pamphlet in which he wrote this drivel. But in any case, like all his works, it was soon out of print and forgotten, just as we had forgotten the delight of organized fun hunt.

Actually, after that piece appeared on the hooting yard website, I received an email from someone telling me that organized Fern hunts have not vanished in the past and there are still many organized Fern hunts. Today you can so I don't know where you'd find out about your nearest organized Fern Hunter. But if you want to go on one, I'm sure you'll be able to find out somehow. This next piece should have been read for obvious reasons, which will become obvious at the end of January. So just take yourself back in time. Well, staff microdrives What a day. Those of you who have studied the hooting yd booko days, well know that today is both potato day and grunting day. That being so I set my alarm and was up and about before dawn to ensure I was in time to follow the annual parade from Pang Hill orphanage. There they all were the Chinese still half asleep, each cluttering a potato in their freezing little hands. Many of the potatoes were severely blighted with the sprang but that is only to be expected. grinds. The Pang Hill allotment keeper has not really been doing his job properly since he was struck by lightning in that terrible storm on some bibley big Dibs day two years ago. But whenever it suggested that he retire and give up his post to a more sprightly replacement, he cast eerie spells. Birds fall from the sky hollyhocks shrivel and die and Pang Hill is overrun with rabid squirrels. It really is best just to leave grinds be sprang blight or no, the orphans were all present and correct huddling in the porch of the orphanage at the crack of dawn, ready for the parade. As the first rays of that mighty orb, the sun appeared on the horizon. The Pang Hill orphanage choir conductor, Baptists stick on the metal plate wedged in grinds his cranium and the tinies. All 40 of them struck up their superb rendition of spam in Allium by Thomas Tallis arranged, high pitched infant grunting and ice like granted, they began to march through solid puddles from the grim orphanage across withered lawns, all the way up into the hills, where they placed their potatoes in a pile outside the layer of the grunty man. Then they marched empty handed, all the way back to their base and British Home grunting Mui la Next, the choir conductors own composition for groans and grunting, which is basically just spam in Allium sung or rather grunted backwards. The sort of thing Brian one brain ino might record and probably has done. Once safe back inside the orphanage. All the tinies were given a radish and some goatee fluid for breakfast. I stayed up in the hills low, hoping to spot the grantee man creep out of his lair and gather up the 40 potatoes left left to him as an offering. It is thought that such a gift will assuage his grumpy Roth for the year ahead, or at least until next week. But of course, there was no sign of him because he stayed inside his foul and stinking den glued to his laptop, watching Tony Blair give evidence to the Chilcott inquiry and grunting throughout. But were they grants of approbation or disdain. Only the grantee man knows and it would be A brave and foolhardy person who attempted a mind meld with that extraordinary and extraordinarily pea sized, grumpy brain.

There comes the time for a lady as indeed for a gentleman, when an invitation is received to attend a function at which the wearing of a stylish hat is de rigueur, receipt of such kind of fluster the hapless and the poor. Imagine you're a pauper, without a hat to call your own. And chanted as you are to be expected at, say, a king's a levy, you will be plunged into seizing fret by dint of both. Sorry, I'm gonna start, I started. Start that sentence again. encountered as you are to be expected at say, a king's Levy, you will be plunged into seizing fret by dint of both your heartlessness and your impecunious state, which forbids you from simply dashing out to wear a hat shop to purchase a stylish hat as a non pauper might do. You could of course, steal a hat, but that would be a step into a moral sewer. And at the last, when your time on earth is done, you would be dragged by fiendish claws into the Hellfire there to burn and rot in all eternity. But fear not. For here is south for your agony from hooting yard hack person Fatima gala Blatt. Fatima has given much thought to the hat pauper conundrum, and I'm pleased to read out her excellent advice. During my long and searching wanderings through the hovels of the destitute I've always been impressed by the fact that even the meanest midden has in it on a window sill or mantlepiece a vase of flowers. Perhaps this is true to the influence of john Ruskin, I do not know, but I know the evidence of my eyes, and everywhere I look, I see vases of flowers. Now, I'm only two well aware of the flap a pauper get into when posty saunters up the filthy line bearing an invitation to a municipal function, or a Swiss cocktail party, or even a king's Levy, any kind of do where one will be barred if not wearing a stylish hat. So I have come up with a simple solution, which is to turn your vase into a hat. The first thing to do is to remove from the vase the flowers launched in it without water and bio nutriment. They will soon wither and die, but you must get your priorities right later, you will have time to weep over them. For now. However, you also need to empty the valves have said water and bio nutriment. So append the valves and pour the W and the B down the sink. If you are so poor that you have no sink, go outside and empty the files into a ditch. You must ensure that the innards of the vase are clean and dry. So wrap some rags about your fist and plunge your arm into the vase. Then make the sort of motion with your hand as you would where you whisking eggs. If the neck of the vase is too narrow for your arm to fit inside it, tie the rags to the stick and poke the stick into the vase instead. Now turn the vase upside down, go and get some Butcher's string. You will be using this to create a loop or lanyard fixed to the vase to be tucked under your chin in order to steadies a hat on your head and ensure it does not topple and smash up on the floor. embarrassingly, just at the moment you are presented to the king or handed a cocktail or asked to draw the raffle at a municipal function. Cut the required length of book to string and then dip each end into a pan of the homemade glue you will have boiled up earlier. Press the sticky ends to the vase holding them in place until we're stuck fast. Try a few experimental tugs. To ensure the string is secure. You can now place the vase still upside down remember upon your bumps and adjust the lanyard under your chin. There you have a stylish hat But Waste not want not, you still have a lot of glue in the pan. So gather such items as fruit and glitter and decorative baubles and smashed up mirror fragments and stick those chaotically all over the bars. Now it is even more stylish, and when you sweep elegantly into the levee, or party or function, all eyes will be on your hat.

Frank Key  20:29
Afterwards, unless you expect another invitation in the very near future, you will probably want to put the vase back on your window sill or mantle piece and place within it fresh flowers grown on your sordid little allotment. Before doing so, you should remove the butcher string and the fruit and the glitter and the decorative baubles and the smashed up mirror fragments. If the glue you boiled is of incredible adhesiveness this will be quite a difficult task. But there is always a price to pay to retrieve style and dash, as I know from my own experience, the telling of which would make you shudder. Next week tea bag as a lampshade.

Um, two or three weeks ago I read an extract from Confessions of a neurasthenic, a 1908 book by William Taylor miles. And included in that quotation was the line. I then came to the conclusion that between being dead with chills and having an inner concrete lining, I would choose the latter, which seemed the lesser evil like William Taylor Mars, Blodgett had to weigh in the balance being dead with chills or having an inner concrete lining. He was at the time shivering in an Antarctic cabin, having been lured there and then abandoned by the criminal lunatic babinski. Though not of a neurasthenic bent himself. Blodgett was immensely well read in the literature of neurasthenia, as he was in the broader field of pet black. We can ascribe this unlikely erudition to the influence on the young bloodroot of this school teacher Mark bought Duke, for whom Pep was king and queen, Prince and princeling, Lord Baron and marquees contract contracted by the school to teach algebra and trig. He was ahead of his time. Perhaps regrettably, in that his lessons were more concerned with self esteem and diversity. Incidentally, he went on to teach a college course in serial killer studies, in which the career of babinski loomed large So, as he sat quaking in his cabin with icicles forming on his nose, Blodgett recalled the choice made by Mars in Confessions of a neurasthenic and resolved to cultivate an in a concrete lining. It was for this reason that he must have a pack of Huskies, harness them to a sledge, and move them North until he reached the sea from bear he stowed away or bought a steamer or sort of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket on a reverse journey fettering up eventually upon a beach suitable for his purpose. Blodgett built himself a shelter, using driftwood and fronds and spent months living on the beach daily ingesting a diet of sand crustacea fruit pips, oysters and seashells. Gradually his limbs began to stiffen, but he was at no risk of chills that even at night, it was a hot beach as beaches go eventually the complete sorry eventually the concrete in croissant within him rendered Blodgett almost wholly immobile, before complete rigidity setting, he made a flag out of cut and dyed front, fixed it to a pole and awaited rescue. Carried aboard the HMS corrugated cardboard by a stretcher. One morning in September, Blodgett was deposited in a lifeboat and covered with a tarp palling, twice a day, a deckhand would appear, Fold back the tarp, shove a farmer into blogilates mouth and pour into it an anticoagulant soft drink sweet and syrupy with just a hint of steak and kidney pie. By the time the ship dr tan Tara bin, Blodgett was able to walk ashore unaided. Though his gait was the subject of chuckles he went immediately to an expression Mental medical facility where he's in a concrete lining, now somewhat softened, was extracted in one piece drawn out through the left ear with pliers and tweezers, exposed to the gusty tantaran air. It soon hardened again. And Blodgett made a living for a few years, exhibiting it standing alongside him. Under the show business Monica Blodgett and his almost life sized concrete effigy, he would play sprightly tunes upon a xylophone while his concrete counterpart stood as if we're listening with rapt attention. That same gusty tan Tara binaire eventually brought Blodgett down with chills, and though he did not die from them, he returned to the medical facility to see if it was possible to have it in a concrete lining reinserted. That will not be possible, said the medical facility head honcho, who was none other than babinski in heavy disguise. He watched the disappointed Blodgett traipse away down the path snuffling hand in hand with the concrete effigy and his lunatic criminal, Brian plotted a further enormity. I'm a bit worried about the grammar of that last sentence, it was babinski watching. Blodgett traipse away,
