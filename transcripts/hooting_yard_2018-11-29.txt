Hello, this is resonance 104 point four f m or w w w dot resonance fm.com. You might not need the www. My name is Frank key This is hooting yard on the air. Now, it's been said that there's nothing more tedious than people telling you their dreams. Dreams are fascinating to the dreamer, but not necessarily to anyone else. But I beg to differ. I've been reading or rereading Thomas de Quincey. And basically for de Quincey, his dreams were far more important than his actual life. And if he hadn't written about his dreams, English literature would be all were poorer, and measurably so. So, with that in mind, I thought I'd tell you about a dream I had last night, which was quite interesting. I was in a, I was in a school. I think it was my old school, or it may may have been, but it was a dream school. And the thing about this school is that each classroom had in it a cupboard containing the class library. Each class had a little library of books on a shelf in this cupboard, and I was invited to go round each classroom, and inspect the books on the on the, on the shelf in each class, and any that I wanted, that weren't really borrowed very often, I could take away with me. And the first classroom I went into was year three. It was that kind of dream. It was quite detailed. And in the year, three cupboard I opened and I looked along the shelf of books. And I spotted two books in particular that took my fancy. One was a biography of Esther ofosu cream. And the other one was a biography of Abby ofori. Older listeners, my record, Esther and Abby Oh, far him, as they were briefly a pop sensation in the UK in the 1960s. And I thought it was interesting that rather than a book one book about Esther and Abby, this was two separate books, one about Esther and one about Abby. And so I was accompanied by a child from the class. And I said, Oh, well, I'm very interested in these two books. I've I borrowed very often, assuming he would say, No, but he said, oh, they're very popular these books. Well, we all read them. So I was unable to take the biography of Esther Oh, foreign or the biography of Abby. Oh, foreign. And with that the dream ended or wandered off down some other avenue. Anyway, Esther is so far in this. I don't know. Do people remember Esther and ibio foreign? I don't know if they do. Esther, is still with us. still singing? I don't know what happened to Abby. They divorced at some point in the early 70s. I do my research. One other result of my research is I learned that back in 1963, before they were famous as a couple in the UK pop charts. Esta despite being Israeli, with the Switzerland entry in the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest. And it occurred to me that listeners might be keen to listen to her entry in that year. It didn't win the entry, of course for the same year as the JFK assassination. Come Incidentally, but I wasn't sure whether or not to play it. So what I did was I dragged someone in off the street, the strip the resonance Studios on borough High Street, which is a kind of reasonably major thoroughfare and I thought I wouldn't have any problem finding someone. So just before the show, I dragged someone in off the street, and I thought I would put to them the question as a typical member of the public would they like to hear eska and Abby, sorry, Not an Abbe espo foreigns 1963 Eurovision song contest entry. So I'm glad thank you for Thank you for coming into the studio with me. Don't get nervous you are on live radio. But I just like to ask you

Frank Key  05:18
as a typical member of the public, would you like to hear? Esther and Esther? Oh foreigns 1963 Eurovision song contest entry for Switzerland?

Unknown Speaker  05:31
Absolutely, I would.

Frank Key  05:33
There we go. So john, would you happen to be able, by the magic of radio to play this for us?

Unknown Speaker  05:42
I think I can

Frank Key  05:43
muster enough energy. Well go Take it away, Esther and john.

Frank Key  08:40
And I can hear you applauding in your own home. As you listen to this on the radio. I have a confession to make. I pretended that I had dragged a member of the public in off the street to give approval to that, in fact, astute listeners may realize that it was pansy cradle drew pansies with us today. Again, hopefully to assist me with reading because the book I brought to read from the type is such that with my catastrophic eyesight, I can barely see it. So pansy is going to read us a story now from the collection. porpoises rescued Dick Van Dyke and she might explain the title to you as well. After she's read this piece, this is called fruit or is gleam.

Unknown Speaker  09:39
Well, it's a bit of a challenge to follow Lester there. She was wonderful, wasn't she? for like, I was sort of taken sort of a cross between Edith Piaf anonymous scurry. For those of you who remember,

Frank Key  09:53
yeah, and yet more talented than either.

Unknown Speaker  09:56
Well, no doubt indeed. So let's move on to a story. This is at Mr. Keys request for tours gleam there was a gleam in the eye of the router. his dog was worrying a toffee apple wrapper in the drain. He sold me a Carlsbad plum. He was a traveling fruiter and he soon went on his way swinging his basket. The dog did not immediately follow. Some yards along the lane, the fruiter stopped enter in his head and called out to the dog. The dog's name was flaps. Here flaps, cried the traveling fuutarou in a rich baritone that would have done him credit on the stage. flaps relinquish the toffee apple wrapper and scampered towards his master, and continued beyond him along the lane, panting I have no idea what sort of dog It was. It was soon out of sight. But the fruiter did not appear at all worried. He too continued on his way more slowly than his dog. on the spur of the moment, I decided I wanted to buy a second Carlsbad plum. I got up from the lane side bench on which I had been sitting and followed the fruiter. I did not call out to Him for the simple reason that I am mute. When I was but tiny I was witness to an abomination. You can draw your own inference inference from that pair of snippets. In any case, I am sure the traveling fruiter is a more interesting character than I am. With the gleam in his eye and his theatrical voice and his swinging basket and his dog flaps. He is the type to gain attention whether he wishes to or no. I, by contrast, could have sat all day upon the bench without attracting the attention of passing persons or dogs or above birds. The fruiter himself would have strode on past oblivious, had I not hailed him and brought him to a halt to buy my Carlsbad plum. voiceless, my hailing method was to flail my arms or to waive a stake now to buy as an afterthought, a second Carlsbad plum, I had to catch up with him further along the lane, so I spent it doing so took me back in reverie to my youth when I won many metal running round and round and athletics track wearing a singlet to which bold numbers were attached both front and back. I usually wore the number nine. I am older and creakier now and I was puffed out by the time I came alongside the traveling fruiter panting like flaps, I slowed to match the fruit tourist pace. I held a lot for Carlsbad club I had already bought, and with my other hand pointed at the fruit basket and by some other signals made plain to him that I wanted to buy a second Carlsbad plan to affect this transaction we both stopped dead on the lane. Looking up ahead, I saw flaps MC trading against the trunk of a lonely you. The fruiter handed me a second Carlsbad plan and I in turn, I gave him some coinage.

Unknown Speaker  13:45
There was still a gleam in his eye, a gleam so resplendent it dazzled me, when is seldom dazzled by fritters in this day and age. Lord knows how much water flaps had lapped from his ball, or from a real that morning, for even as I was be dazzled by the fritters gleam I saw out of the corner of my eye that his dog continued to expel a stream of pest against the EU in an unstoppable flow. I worried he might poison the roots. The you would wither and woodsmen an axis would come. woodsmen with axes would come to chop it down, and it would all be the fault of flaps, and by extension of the fruit her would his eyes still gleam when in a far town a year hence, he sat at the tavern table drinking his pot and read in the local paper of the shriveled and felled yew tree and cast his mind back to that summer's morning when he sold a brace of Carlsbad plums to a mute and flaps relieved himself his jet of canine peice powerful and prolonged drenching the trunk of that very you sinking and sweeping through the soil, weathering the roots.

Frank Key  15:27
Thank you, pansy. I have a book with me with slightly larger type, so I may be able to read it. The book is Mr. Keys, shorter, potted brief, brief lives. And this is about Henry Frederick Druid, the Prince of Wales 1594 to 1642 I think when King James the first son was welcomed into the merchant tables company in 1611 or six sorry 1601 laid on a feast vein.

Interesting that they had no.

Frank Key  17:57
And before pansy returns to the mic. I just thought I'd read you something about Fred Goodwin, the Scottish banker, the disgraced Scottish banker, born 1958. The man who brought the Royal Bank of Scotland crashing down, displayed, quote, a particular horror of any public use of sellotape is other phobias included peanuts, carpets, false teeth, Christmas cards, violins filing cabinets, and pink wafer biscuits. Mike, isn't that what you will? And here's pansy to explain the title of the book. porpoises rescue Dick Van Dyke, copies of which are available if you go to the hunting yard website and look for a picture of the cover down the kind of right hand side of the screen. Click on that and you can go and buy it.

Unknown Speaker  19:03
Well, as promised, this is for those of you who don't know the story behind the title of the book porpoises rescued Dick Van Dyke. This is a news story from the Guardian on the 11th of November 2010. It's true story. Mary Poppins star feared death after apparently falling asleep on his surfboard, but friendly sea creatures pushed him to shore. On screen tick Van Dyck has been rescued from an untimely death by flying cars and magical nannies. Off screen the veteran star of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins had to rely on the help of a part of porpoises after apparently dozing off on his surfboard. I'm not kidding, he said afterwards. Van dikes ordeal began during an ill fated trip to his local beach Woke up out of sight of land. The 84 year old actor told Craig Ferguson on his TV chat show. I started paddling with the swells. And I started seeing fins swimming around me. And I thought, I'm dead. Van Dyke was wrong. They turned out to be porpoises, he said, and they pushed me all the way to shore. The porpoises were unavailable for comment.

Frank Key  20:48
Now, we heard about Fred Goodwin's various weird, folks, phobias. Kaspar Hauser, the German Enigma and feral child 1813 1812 to 1833. Many of you will know him from the Verner Hertzog film, the Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. The doctor who cared for Kaspar Hauser, was befuddled by the variety of things that caused him stress, distress. He was unhinged, not by pink wafer biscuits or public displays of sour type, but by thunderstorms. The full moon brandy, loud noises quiet noises, squeezed trees, bright daylight, beer, tats, spiders, snakes, flowers, grape juice, beards, the color black and comedy. So those are the things that he was scared of and the next step in our phobia listed sir Edwin Lutyens, English architect 1869 to 1941. Latvians was averse to long stemmed classes, fish knives, cut flowers, silk lampshades, pile carpets, the seaside statistics, painted nails, the diagonal placing furniture and religious enthusiasm. And we have one more phobia list. But before we have that pansy is going to read another story.

Unknown Speaker  22:46
I banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of my troubles. The font was hewn from Adam mantiene rock, and the water it contained. Though of necessity holy water was icy. When the priests slapped it on to my bashed head, I screamed at such a pitch that a stained glass window depicting the martyrdom of Saint bibley bit dip, spikes, tongs, fire was shattered, falling sharp slice the priests juggler, and he collapsed. But not before dropping me into the font. While I splashed about balling and freezing, miniscule organisms from which the water was riddled, swam into my ears, and burrow tiny tunnels into my brain when they lay their eggs. If the organisms were miniscule, imagine how microscopically we were their eggs. before death claimed me. I was plucked from the font by the Sexton, whose beard was so vast and hairy that I was almost suffocated is he clutched me to him. gurgling I was passed to my mother, a woman of great darkness, who endangered my life many a time in the following months, usually by taking me to unsuitable picnics, unsuitable and that they took place in snow storms, or during beaumier weather on steep hillsides down which I would roll gathering pace as I approached at the bottom, a railway line or major arterial thoroughfare along which huge container loise thundered. Fortunately, though perplexingly, the Sexton was always on hand to rescue me in the nick of time. Miraculously, I survived into toddlerhood. Around this time, my mother began to encourage me to play on the roof of our hotel during electrical storms. I was grateful for the rubber booties and leadline swaddling jacket the Sexton gave me More than once I toppled from the roof into the moat, and I assume Learn to swim skillfully to dodge both the sharp fangs scavenger fish and the unexploded mines they're in. Regular swimming while wearing rayment of lead does wonders to build up one's muscular strength. And sure enough, by my sixth birthday, my mother was exhibiting me at surfaces and freak shows. I was known as Little dagobert, the strongest boy in the universe. Sometimes I came close to being flattened by the steam rollers I pulled across lawns and village greens, until the Sexton gave me a handy tip to avoid even the gentlest of downhill inclines. Being of an implausibly rare blood group, I had to be extra careful in the vicinity of sharp knives, axes and slicers. My caution served me well when, on my 10th birthday, my mother had me apprentice to a well known butcher. He was a florid, chubby, deranged and blood drenched man, who took both pride and pleasure in his inhumane slaughtering methods. I was inconsolable for days after he slew the Sexton and chopped him to bits and made him into illegal pie fillings. I resolved to run away to see that we lived far, far from any coast. One crisps autumns, one crisp autumns dawn, I gathered my few pitiable belongings and tied them in a bundle and tied the bundle to the end of a stick. And with the stick prop gently over my shoulder, I set out to make my way in the world. Before I got so far as the garden gate however, the microscopic eggs in my brain all hatched at once and let fourth monsters the Y had passed through much travail in my short life. Things were about to get much, much worse.

Thank you crazy and to end the show, as promised, the phobias of HG Wells. Actually, Wells was bothered by shaving, washing, answering letters, talking to people doing up parcels and finding pieces of string or envelopes or stamps. Not quite as good as pink wafer biscuits and comedy. But anyway, one of his better known works which I have read Actually, this is 1933 novel, the bulk pingtan of black subtitled adventures, poses stresses, conflict and disaster in a contemporary brain. That may be a description of this program. I don't know. My thanks to pansy Craven Jew for coming to the rescue and reading most of it for me, in my in my sightless state, and to john as over for producing it. And miraculously finding the recording of ESCO firing at the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest. Perhaps we'll have more from Esther next week, and, you know, maybe half the show could be her singing. I don't know. We'll see. I'll dragger member of the public and off the street and ask them if that's what they'd like to hear. So I'll be back next week, hopefully. And until then, go to the heating yard website, which hasn't been updated for ages. But there's so much there that I'm sure you'll find something to entertain you. And there will be a hooting yard advent calendar starting on Saturday. So look out for that and bye bye
