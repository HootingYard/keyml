Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM, w w w dot resonance fm.com My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And what happens in this show, as has happened for the last 13 years, is I read to you for about 28 and a half minutes, or 29 minutes. And, and then in between we get little bits of the Caucasian lullaby by Henry gallon slap happy. That's it, really. So, if that sounds interesting, then stay tuned in. And if it doesn't sound interesting, listen anyway, just in case you learn something, because he might. And I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I think I have the makings of an excellent singing teacher. I am to pedagogy as a duck to water. There's nothing that cannot be taught by ferocious spittle flecked shouting, accompanied by thumped on the head with a big stick. It's true that my field of expertise is ornithology, not singing. But I have taught even the most recalcitrant dimwit to identify four different types of bird with as near as dammit, a 25% success rate. The birds were a swan, an owl, a Wren and an ostrich. I'd like to teach the world to sing. And the world is rather larger than the classroom in the cellar of Pang Hill orphanage where I currently teach. In fact, I've never taught anywhere else as far as I can recall, and I have rarely taught anything other than bird identification skills. Apart from occasional sessions of boot scrubbing mucking about with source burns, and guttural German. But pedagogy courses through my veins like blood, the more recalcitrant dimwits among the orphans often develop nosebleeds after my thumb pings, so I know what blood looks like, even though it's not my field of expertise. Another reason I'm well suited to the task of teaching the world to sing is that I awake every morning with a song in my heart. Often it is a tuneless and monotonous dirge, which is the best I can muster when I wake in a foul temper, as I usually do. My attic bedroom that Pang Hill often ages, dark and dismal and icy cold, even at the height of summer. I have been told this has something to do with local atmospheric conditions. But such conditions are out with my field of expertise, so I cannot judge the truth of this claim. Sometimes a frail and freezing Robin will come and perch on my window silver morning. I think it's a Robin, though it's difficult to tell through the grease and grime smeared window, but at the site or be blurred of a feathered friend. The song in my heart is that carrier and more uptempo one, such as withered and died by Richard and Linda Thompson. Before I teach the world to sing, then I will make a start by teaching the orphans to sing. But before I teach the orphans to sing, I will hone my singing teacher techniques, shouting big stick by teaching monkeys to sing. There is a monkey house at Pang hills Zoo over on the other side of the hill beyond the viaduct. Through bribery and threats. I obtained a key to the monkey house. I think the janitor who passed me the key assumed I wanted to gain access to the monkeys for unseemly purposes. Well, let him think what he likes. I will betray him to the zoo authorities in any case, and he will languish in a prison cell while I teach the monkeys to sing. Update. I have discovered that most of the monkeys in the world He house at Pang Hill Zoo are howler monkeys, like an already how their little heads off like nobody's business. My work is done.

I was commissioned to write a fat book entitled meetings with remarkable buntings by road poised, I was about to set to work. When it occurred to me that I did not know whether I was meant to be writing about birds, or those decorative strings of triangular flags festooned at festive occasions, such as gala days, I rang the publishers to find out. The person I spoke to sounded about 12 years old, and was brimming with confidence in spite of being clueless. As soon as I uttered the word bird, she started to babble excitedly about something called Twitter. I slammed the phone down. I was able to do this because I was using a proper telephone, one where the receiver resting on a cradle. With these newfangled mobile horas one cannot slam them down in a satisfying spat of ill temper without risking breaking. I decided my best bet was to write about both types of bunting. And with the twittery inanities of the publisher sloshing in my ears, took up my bio to write about the bird. But then I paused the title of the book spoke of meetings with buntings. I will have to go and find a bunting and commune with it. Now, my own theological ignorance is staggering. And frankly, I wouldn't Banting for not hat you're a puppet or a Starling or a wagtail. So I rang the emergency bird information hotline. The person who answered the phone sounded about 12 years old and was brimming with avian confidence. I told her I wanted to know all there was to know about buntings. Do you mean the bird over decorative strings of triangular flags for students at festive occasions such as garba days? she asked. Well, you're the emergency bird information hotline. I said. So I mean, the bird obviously. It might seem obvious to you, she said, but you'd be surprised how many inquiries we receive about the decorative strings of crying. The flags. Were a very festive organization forever holding fates and gardeners. And so we have bunting hanging permanently outside our headquarters. I think that's why people call us when they want to know about non bird banding as well as bunting the bird. Well, I want to know about the bird I said, but she was prattling on regardless. Actually, we're having a little garden party this afternoon in celebration of the common caffeine. Would you like to come you'll be able to see our display of bunting the decorative strings of triangle of flags that is rather than the birds. But there'll be a couple of stuffed calf injuries for you to look at if you want to know more about them. I want to know about the Banting not that caffeine. I shouted and slammed the phone down again. In my rather satisfying stateville temper I went for a walk by the pond and chucked pebbles and swans. Then it occurred to me that I ought to attend the garden party so I could continue commune with the non bird bunting. Then at least I would have something to write about. I promised home and rang the emergency bird information hotline again. A robotic voice informed me that the line had been disconnected. I paired to my escrow twang and picked up my borrow. Over the course of my life. I have met many remarkable buntings. I wrote lying shamelessly, but who would know? none more so perhaps, than bunting the Swedish halfbreed skimo horse which became a film star. Bunting played Pippi Longstocking horse, Lula gubin in a series of films directed by Ali herringbone. Of course, I've never actually met bunting and my knowledge of horses is as patchy as my knowledge of birds. But I thought I was getting to grips with my material bird and those jackets strings of triangle of flags festooned at festive occasions, such as gala days and emergency bird information hotline garden parties in celebration of the common chaffinch could take a backseat for the time being. By the time I'd finished with Banting, the film star horse, we would be firm friends and boon companions, at least within my head. I made a mental note to ring the publisher and suggest we amend the title of my book to meetings with remarkable buntings inside my head.

Then I carried on writing Daddy, oh, my god man possessed of unfathomable horse based inventive genius.

The following piece was written on the second of January, which explains the opening sentence. Not this year either. But the second of January in a previous year at some point during the life of rooting out on the air. The New Year got off to an auspicious start yesterday morning. Almost the first word I heard after tuning into Excuse me. I'm going to start that one again. The New Year got off to an auspicious start yesterday morning. Almost the first word I heard after tuning into farming today on BBC Radio four word Swan guru. Outside it was still in the dark before dawn, but I resolved with New Year vim to go in search of my very own Swan guru. I was not listening to the radio with sufficient attention. To learn whether a swan guru was on the one hand, a human being possessed of breathtaking insight into swans, or on the other a swan possessed a breathtaking spiritual insight, which could act as my teacher and guide. But I knew which one I preferred, and it wasn't the human being. And so as the first light of the New Year spread across the sky, like a patient he theorized upon a table, I set out for nameless pond in search of a swarm. As I looked towards the pond, I recalled the popular hooting yard series notable authors sitting on swans, with featured photographs of notable authors sitting on swans, the swan upon which the infant Raymond Roussel sat for example, was it a mere Swan? Or was it the writers Swan guru? I did not suppose I would ever know the answer to that question. But just posing it made me all a keener to lay claim to my own Swan guru. standing at the edge of nameless pond on which several sprightly and savage New Year swans were scouting, I tried to determine which one would be the perfect spiritual teacher. But then I was struck by two thoughts. One, I'm extremely myopic, to I am ontologically, ignorant. If I were to pick a particular Swan here and now as my guru, would I be able to recognize that Swan on subsequent visits to a nameless pond? I had to concede that this seemed unlikely. In my world, a swan is a swan is a swan. Well, then, that being so why not choose the swan nearest at hand as my guru? Next time I came here, the nearest Swan might well be an entirely different swarm. But did that really matter? So long as I received from it, the spiritual sucker I sought. Convinced that I had hit upon an effective method of mitigating my myopia and ornithological ignorance. I fixed my gaze upon the nearest swan. The next couple of minutes would prove critical. I had to lay myself open, fully receptive to whatever spiritual wisdom the swan saw fit due in part to me. The better To accomplish this, I gawped open mouthed dribbling slightly like a dim witted child. I tried to empty my brain of all conscious thought, and I succeeded so well, that I toppled over having forgotten how How to stand up bright. sprawled in the pond side mud. I sensed a terrifying in rush of what I can only describe those swamp Enos or Swan loss it is surged through me magnificently. I stood up, dusted myself down bid adhere to my Swan guru with a wave of my hand and set off for home row betide anybody I met along the way with one of my when I would break their arm.

You may have noticed a theme this week in which all the pieces I'm reading contain swans. At the beginning of this year 2017 I decided to have plums as my theme. And I've read many, many pieces which are either about plums or just mentioned a plum somewhere in them. And in fact, I have read nearly everything that is on the hooting yard website at hunting yard.org that contains the word plump. So I got to the end of that. So I thought, well, I need a new theme. And the new theme is swans. And we're going to see how long will say how long map to last. I did notice that the very first piece that came up when I put it into the hooting out search engine was a piece called plums and swans, which made me laugh but I haven't read that to you for reasons I can't recall, possibly because I read it quite recently. Anyway moving on, here's something else starring the the your everyone's favorite out of print pamphleteer Dobson you seem preoccupied Dobson said marigold true to the out of print pamphleteer one morning over breakfast. It was a thunderous die of thunder and thunder claps and the couple tucking into boiled sewage and marzipan. Allah Mehta, Nick, a dish extolled in a footnote in Dobson's pamphlet, breakfast favorites of the Austrian Empire foreign ministry 1809 to 1821 out of print. Dobson did not reply for he was preoccupied. The following morning over breakfast marigold crew became so perturbed Dobson's seeming residence in La La Land, that he resorted to the Dusty Springfield method to snap him out of it. Named after the 1960s pop strolls hobby, this involved the systematic smashing of crockery by throwing plates and dishes one by one with great indeed hysterical force against the wall several smithereens like scattered on the floor before Dobson was of a sudden and preoccupied Ah, good morning, my butter cup of unparalleled gorgeousness, said Dobson, through a mouthful of steamed shredded highest in the stalks in syrup. You have been terribly preoccupied. Dobson said marigold, true. whatever is going on in that brain of yours. I am inwardly tussling said Dobson with my latest pamphlet, to which I have given the working title and the Martin the tyrannical leader of unit and why he is the most fantastic person in the visible universe. I have no doubt your inner tussle will prove as productive as ever said marigold true, but may I make one small point, a point which I suggest is germane to your tussle and preoccupation. And what would that be a daffodil of my dreams, said Dobson. Well, as you and I and your optometrist know only too well Dobson, you are severely myopic. That's for you. the visible universe does not stretch very far. Indeed, it stops just a few inches away from the front of your head. I do not see Andy Martin tyrannical leader of unit in the vicinity and I feel sure I would spot him where he within a few inches of or indeed sitting at My breakfast table. I'm going to go and Chuck pebbles at swarmed, said Dobson, getting up from his chair and putting on his suebi and bus ticket collectors boots and crashing out of the door into the downpour, which, as on the day before, was accompanied by thunderous thunder and thunderclaps. marigold crew had raised a sticky problem about his pamphlet, one he did not wish to discuss, indeed, could not discuss, hence his sudden departure, leaving his breakfast unfinished.

Frank Key  20:37
Unfortunately, so sudden was his departure that Dobson neglected to put on his specs. Unable to see more than a few inches ahead, he blundered towards where he thought the duck pond world, only to take a wrong turn and find himself hopelessly lost in a patch of Bracken and rustic filth. He found himself to once more preoccupied, but this time on a wholly different subject. Why he wondered, was the duck pond, populated as it was mostly by swans, called the duck pond, rather than the swan pond? It was true that ducks were occasionally to be found dabbling upon it. But any such duck tended to scarper pretty quickly when ganged up on by the savage and violent yet in Juba terribly elegant swans. I wonder set Dobson to himself allowed in the midst of in the midst of his own myopia whether I ought to abandon the Andy Martin tyrannical leader of unit business for the time being, and instead turn my propelling pencil to the question of duck pond nomenclature. And there was then a terrifying, thunderous and thundery thunderclap, which Dobson chose to interpret as the gods replying to his question in the affirmative. Turning in the direction he thought would take him home. He wrapped his Stalinist scars scarf tight around his neck, and squelch through the muck. But, alas, the pamphlet his sense of direction was as pitiful as his eyesight, and several weeks passed before he found his way home, by which time he had completely forgotten about duck ponds and Swan ponds. What is the subject of the pamphlet you're working on? asked marigold to over breakfast on the morning after Dobson's return. It is called fortune telling by interpreting the patterns created by crockery smithereens smashed according to the Dusty Springfield method, said Dobson. And I expect to be able to adopt the final eye and cross the final tee this very afternoon. And he did that the pamphlet itself is currently out of print.

You don't need me to tell you that. The the dusty Springfield's details in that title are, in fact true. But I'm gonna tell you anyway, Dusty Springfield did in fact make a hobby of she actually used to order from from, I think from one of the major London department stores, she used to order crates of new crockery and have them delivered to her house where she would smash them against the wall. I stassi. I was reading the other day back. Excuse me. I was reading the other day about closed down shipyards. And I came upon a reference to swarm Hunter. This serves to remind me of a fellow I met recently whose business card which he handed to me, announced his business as a swan Hunter. We were guests at the swished sophisticated cocktail party, and he was leaving in seussian me against the mantle piece. He apologized that the card was smeared with blood, explaining that it was the blood of a swan and that such smearing was an occupational hazard. Surely, I said, there's not much hunting to do to find swans. Do you not just head for the nearest body of water such as a pond or a canal? Where swans are known to frequent there is a measure of truth in what you say. He replied, bringing up an unseemly God. of Qatar and spitting it into a napkin. But first, one must find the pond or canal. Those swans are almost invariably found on ponds and canals. It does not follow that all ponds and canals have their residence swans as a moment's thought will confirm. Fair enough, I said, but identifying most ponds and canals where you might find a swan hardly counts as hunting, you just need to obtain a map and mark a penciled x mark with a pencil of x those ponds and canals shown on it, which are known to be populated by swarmed, you can do that while sitting in an armchair. He spat into his napkin again. I could indeed he said, but that would take all the thrill out of the hunt. I prefer to go a roaming through the countryside or through a large municipal Park, sniffing the air and studying the terrain until I tracked down a pond or a canal. And even then, he continued before I had a chance to interrupt, even then there can be no guarantee that the pond or canal I come upon will be wonderful. The uncertainty adds to the excitement. It might be more accurate to say then that you're a pond and canal Hunter, rather than a swan Hunter. I said. Bosh he shouted, slopping some of his cocktail onto the hearth rug. Where no swans are in evidence upon the pond or canal, I have stalked I press on indefatigably come rain or shine. So let us assume I said that you have arrived at a pond or canal teeming with swans, whether in the countryside or in Parkland. Do you then take potshots at them with a mandalika car car no snipers rifle. Heaven forfend, he's cried, swapping more cocktail onto the rug. Where would be the sport in that? No, I go on armed Swan hunting, when executed properly is the pitting of man against swarm in a primal struggle. Having selected an individual swarm, I engage in combat. That is why I have had my arms broken several times in several places. Ah, I said I was wondering why you held your cocktail glass at a rather curious angle. Actually, I wasn't wondering that at all. I was just making conversation. It's never been my habit to examine in any detail the angles at which swished sophisticated cocktail party guests hold their cocktail glasses, nor for that matter, and my magic exercised when in their excitement. They slop some of the contents of said glasses onto the hearth rug. Unless of course, it's my own hearth rug. But it never is, for I do not host my own cocktail parties. I'm temperamentally incapable of organizing sufficient sausages on sticks due to my cat handedness, which invariably means I prick my fingers and thumbs repeatedly with these sharp wooden cocktail sticks growing blood.

Frank Key  28:19
No one in their right mind wants to attend a party, however sumptuous the cocktails if the plates littered with sausages lying and punctured, beside piles of bloody wooden sticks. A business card smeared with the blood of a swarm seemed to me a far less gruesome sight. In fact, the more I thought about it, my own reservations about hosting a cocktail party seem to be measurably more interesting than listening to a man Wittering on about his experiences of unarmed combat with swans fighting to the death. Only my impeccable manners prevented me from saying so in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone else in the room. It was only then looking round that I noticed the swan hunter and I were the only guests still present. Everyone else had tiptoed out through the open French windows. peering out into the dusk I saw approaching marching relentlessly across the lawn, a gaggle of savage and vengeful swans. And that's the end of this week's show. They'll probably be more about swans next week. Bye bye.
