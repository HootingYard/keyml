Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. And this is volcanoes bees and Jesuits weekly half an hour of chat about Jesuits, volcanoes and bees. Sorry, it's not completely the wrong program. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for half an hour as ever. Nothing about bees or volcanoes or Jesuits. But here's a note about pigs. From the gross pneus of his feeding from the large amount of element he consumes his gluttonous way of eating it from his slothful habits, laziness and indulgence in sleep. That pig is particularly liable to disease, and especially indigestion, heartburn, and affections of the skin, wrote Isabella beaten in her book of household management 1861. Going on to note to counteract the consequence of a violation of the physical laws, a powerful monitor in the brain of a pig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine. When he read these words, exactly 100 years after their publication, a firestorm convulsed Dobson's brain. He had never given much thought to pigs. But now he became obsessed with discovering the precise nature of that powerful monitor. If he could harness its power, who knew what wonders might be achieved? I am going to devote the rest of my life to what Mrs. Beeton calls the powerful monitor in the brain of a pig. He announced two marigolds to one rainy Wednesday morning in 1961. As they walked across the southern fields towards the old kiosk for their breakfast crackers, and I will harness it, he added shouting, you're going to become Half Man Half pig, asked marigold to of course not counted the out of print pamphleteer and went into one of his socks. marigold to assume that this latest fad of Dobson's would fizzle out within hours or days, and she was disconcerted A week later to find dozens of pigs lolling around in the back garden, standing in their midst was Dobson holding a large metal cone from which wires and other gubbins trailed. Where did all these pigs come from? And what's that you're holding? asked marigold true. I borrowed the pigs from old farmer guys to connect. And this is a rudimentary brain scanning machine with which I intend to locate the powerful monitor contained in the brain of each and every pig. Isn't that obvious? So saying Dobson, approached the pig nearest to him, a plump and dappled creature of I know not what breed of hog and tried to affect one of the lengths of trailing wire to its head, being a butter fingers, that pamphleteer turned pig man failed. Even his umpteenth attempt for the pig defied all attempts to be forcibly attached to the metal cone. marigold Chu did not offer to help, instead returning to the house to make a cup of cocoa and to play a recording by the budget spinny dance orchestra at deafening volume to drown out the grunting and squealing noises from the garden. Dobson came in about half an hour later fractious and disheveled his hair in a frenzy and his cone dented. The Monitors in the brains of these pigs, he said, are more powerful when Mrs Beeton realized, even though my splendid metal cone has been dented, and its trailing wires and other gubbins frayed rent, or in some cases detached, initial readings indicate to me that extremely interesting vibrations are being emitted, especially by the plumpest and most dappled pigs. Not just vibrations, mind you, but rays. He took a hammer from a cupboard and began beating out the dent in the cone. readings, asked marigold to Dobson stop hammering and flail the sheaf of papers at her. There were dozens of sheets, one for each pig, and each was covered with scribbles writing graphs, diagrams and lists of numbers.

The human mind declaimed dogs And cannot correlate this stream of pig related data. That is why I intend to harness their powerful brain monitors for my own purposes. future editions of Mrs. Burton's book of household management will be incomplete without my majestic addendum, which will probably run to twice the length of the book itself. When I have beaten out every last dent in this metal cone, I shall place it atop my own head, sit down at my guitar, and set to work on a piece of writing that will outshine all my other pamphlets and will shake the world. As Dobson picked up the hammer again, a rustic urging appeared in the doorway. I've been sent by old farmer guy stick and asked, he said in an adenoidal bleed, he says he wants all his pigs back by dusk for Ave sleepeezee in in their sty and out in the open of your garden, they'll have nightmares. If you've ever seen dozens of pigs in the grip of night terrors, you'll do as he says. The boy led the pigs through the house out into the lane and led them gently Homewood Dobson sat with the cone on his head, sharpening his pencil, but the fire had gone out of him, and he scrolled only a few sad and broken words, before slumping onto the floor, where marigold Chu found him in the small hours of the morning, dreaming of pigs. And in these dreams, the pigs were happy. They were Oh, so happy.

astute listeners may know that that's the second piece in about three weeks that ended with an image of happy pigs. I don't know what that says about my subconscious. You can write in and tell me if you like intriguing news from the world of letters where we the poet Dennis bear pint has turned his hands to a work of prose fiction. And I've received a review copy of the novel entitled The unspeakably squalid bit crumpled moment of tadeo Gabo presumably on the basis that I'll give it a favorable notice. And that's boost Mr. Beer pints bank palette balance will be at flimsily and immense mass of clotted nonsense. That was the verdict of the magazine teachers world upon the first publication of Ulysses by James Joyce, which apparently Joyce himself always pronounced boluses. Anyway, yes, the teachers world called a Ulysses an immense mass of clotted nonsense. And I'm tempted to say the same about this beer pint book and leave it at that. astonishingly, however, this thousand page tome has already been made a set book for schools, colleges and orphanages throughout the land, which means that your tots if you have any or you, if you are a taught, will have to become familiar with it. When examination time comes round, everyone's knowledge of Dennis beer pints fictional for Argo will be tested to the fall. And so public spirited as ever, I'm going to try to save you from wasting your precious time actually reading the damn thing by telling you what you need to know. So here's a brief guide to the unspeakably squalid bit Crump element of tadeo Gobbo fun Dennis beer pint plot tadeo Gobbo is a princeling in a fictional renascence City State, clearly meant to remind us of the setting of a Jacobean drama such as the Koreas tragedy by Richard wolfinger, as the novel opens, Gobbo is pristine, even and uncreased. If he were a piece of cardboard, writes be a pint, he would not be of the corrugated kind. chapter by chapter we watch as the princeling becomes evermore be crumpled in a variety of unspeakably squalid ways, until at the end, there is a deus ex machina, and he is unfolded and ironed out. Characters tadeo Garbo is a crude self portrait of the author sharing his weakness, neurasthenia predilection for twee verse and hypochondria. Many of his big crumpled moments are accompanied by the onset of an imagined disease such as yours, the bindings, au flux, black bile, bitter colic, and the strangler Yuri Beer pint attempts to play up a certain devil may care for parishioners, but this is never convincing. In fact, it's laughably inept. There is a host of secondary characters, the most important being lugu breo. The princelings Mad stellato wielding uncle bear pint is constantly harping on about his frantic black eyebrows, which soon becomes tiresome. lagu barrios sole motive for all his actions from eating his breakfast to murdering a crippled beggar his revenge, but what or whom he is avenging is never made clear to the reader. Other characters in the novel are a mixture of fictional legendary and real historical figures. Among the latter are Anthony Burgess, Edward G. Robinson, Emily Dickinson, L. Ron Hubbard, and Veronica Lake. Bay pint thinks he's being clever by setting one of the scenes in a so called Scientology tent on the banks of Lake Veronica. But the effect is simply witless. And the reader will struggle not to throw the book into the fireplace.

Imagery as a poet bear pint has been praised for his imagery, although I can't think why. And the unspeakably squalid bit crumpled moment of tadeo Gabo is jam packed with all his old favorites, Crow's cow cows, burnt toast, pencil cases, weather systems, the blood spotted handkerchief of a tuberculosis patient, chaffinches hedgerows, the horn of plenty and the garden of get cemani mud chutes mudchute potato recipes and pastry fillings, starlings, pigs, more starlings, more pigs are nightmarish. Our Beano hen and the Munich air disaster are all evoked at one time or another in imagistic ways. As the princeling becomes ever further bit crumbled. Does the book have heft? Yes, it does. Structure The book is divided into 49 chapters fairly uniform in length. Each chapter ends with a reminder as if the reader needed one that a further stage of unspeakably squalid bit crumbled moment has taken place, except for the last chapter to which I've already referred. Bear pint is clearly fond of the practice found in the picaresque novel of summarizing the plot in his chapter headings. To take a random example, Chapter x x v AI is titled, in which the crumpling of tadeo Gobbo proceeds apace, as his mad uncle Luke dubrio unleashes a swarm of killer bees into the sports arena during a wrestling contest, and a false eclipse of the sun leads to rioting and flux, together with some notes on the flocking of chaffinches and the nesting habits of starlings and aside in which are missing punctuation marks, spells Doom for an apothecary, and the reappearance of lagu brios lobster, plagiarism or quotations. certain passages in the book appear to have been copied verbatim from novels by Barbara Taylor Bradford, Elias Canetti, Dan Brown, and the sociopathic ex jailbird, Jeffrey Archer. Dennis Pierpont presumably considers this to be post modernist irony, which is a dangerous medical condition best treated by having one's brain slowest out with a violent purgative narrative sloppiness untold oodles of it. It's a sloppy flabby and slapdash book from first to last, as its core is a burning jewel of flummery and poppycock. brow, neither high middle nor low, not even know brow. This book brow is frantic and black. Sea above bookcase location. Finding the right spot for this volume on your bookcase or bookshelf is likely to be fraught with difficulty. Dobson's invaluable pamphlet on the shelving of books, which is sadly out of print will not help you, even if you managed to track down a copy. For as the Titanic pamphleteer readily admits there are certain books especially those written by twee poets such as Dennis beer pint, which resists proper shelving on even the most well ordered of bookcases. top left corner no squeezed in among the drivel and tat on the bottom shelf, hardly shoved by on the collected works of Edward upward and quietly forgotten. Certainly not, because you'll always remember that it's there and it's hidden presence will reproach you every time you go anywhere near the bookcase, and you will be as the lowest worm or beetle, or that which creepeth on its belly in the foulest mark of the earth. maddeningly Dobson goes no further, he leaves us in the lurch. He refuses to say what I think he means set fire to the damn thing in your garden. Just as Anthony Burgess's biographer Roger Lewis was tempted to do with a rival life of the absurd Mancunian polymath marketing ploy. Each copy of the unspeakably squalid bit crumble moment of tadeo Gobbo comes with a free gift, there's a paper bag of Badr food. For that reason alone, I recommend that you go and buy a copy at once.

Now and again, it will do you a power of good to spend a Wednesday morning tramping along a high Ridge blowing a trumpet and waving a banner. If you can persuade others to join you so much the better. It will not matter if you will tune listen raggle taggle, the experience itself can pump vital energy into your blood oxygenating your brain and feeding crucial nutrients into your integuments that is the advice I was given by my mentor, or at least by a book handed to me by my mentor. On the day I said farewell to him for the last time. It was not a day I'm ever likely to forget. After the dawn calisthenics, we had sausages for breakfast. I have never tasted the like before or since God only knows what they were made of Ambrosia perhaps or Manor. My mentor was kind enough for once to overlook my disgusting table manners, even going so far as to hand me several extra napkins from his precious supply. When I had finished mopping up my drool and spillages he beckoned me with the claw of gak and we headed off up into the hills to that layer of his which until now had been forbidden to me. Had I not eaten such a gigantic breakfast, my heart would have been palpitating. As it was my corporeal being was preoccupied with its digestive functions, freeing my brain to do the palpitations. Once inside the layer or cave, my mentor handed me a trumpet and a banner and the book which I have already mentioned. And then he vanished in a puff of inexplicable Rosi eight vapor. I was alone. I waited for the vapor to disperse, and then I strode out of the cave. No, I'm mustn't lie. And then I minced out of the cave, and I tumbled down the hillside, battering my trumpet in the process. And I rummaged around in my mentors pantry until I found more sausages. And while I cook them, I practiced a few tubes on the trumpet, and I read the book The passage quoted at the beginning comprises the complete text, and then I am held I'm filled my banner. And when I had finished eating all of the sausages, I set out to make my own way in the world.

Fictional athlete Bob net to vol one famous a sprinter, and it's not commonly known that he was also a champion player of Mansfield. It's likely that his cantankerous trainer, old hollub kept this quiet for Mansfield is a brutal and dangerous contact sport. Played with agricultural shovels. It is also illegal To the untrained eye, a Mansfield match is indistinguishable from a whirling tangle of peasants smashing each other in the face with their shovels. drawers get broken, blood flows from head wounds, eyes are pulled out, and all sorts of other head injuries are the inevitable result of a well thought tie. There's a lot of shouting and a lot of groaning and howling in agony. Volunteer ambulance services are usually on hand and keen young medical students have a triage at the side of the pitch. It's the pitch itself that tells us we're witnessing a proper sport with codes and rules, and not just a fight in a muddy field. And it's the form of the pitch, which explains why the sport is called Mansfield. As with other sports, the rules developed gradually and for many years, Mansfield was a little more than an excuse for roaming bands of countryside persons to bash each other about with shovels, spades, hoes, and rakes. Often it seems that games resulted from rivalry between one farmer and another, over a way of settling disputes about hedges, duck ponds and hen coops. Legend has it that the passing fortune teller, one day watched a particularly violent brawl in which over 100 peasants were embroiled in a fight so blood drenched that vultures circled overhead and carrion crows swept in from the west. Unusually for amigas, for whom the stars in the firmament were as simple to read as an infant story about poxy the pig, the fortune teller had a passion for bureaucracy as much as he could appreciate the celestial order of the universe. He was equally if not more concerned with the lower level order of rules and timetables and regulations, often arbitrary and senseless ones. They have their own beauty for him, and he was very mundane makers. So it was that watching toothless and mud begrimed peasants whacking each other, brainless with a jumble of different farm implements. The fortune teller saw what no one else could see. He peered into the future, and saw an organized sport, still a brutal, impassioned fight, but one which would adhere to a coherent system, a sports like lacrosse, or water polo, or his own favorite ping pong. The mundane makers sat down on a tuffet of spurge and rummaged in his maker's bag, pulling out an astrological birth chart for the writer Katherine Mansfield 1888 to 1923. Its central circle showed a number of lines, crosses squares and triangles in green and red, which struck him as the perfect pitch markings for the sport he foresaw and are of course now familiar to Mansfield aficionados in rural backwaters across the globe. Wherever the game is played. On the back of the chart, he scribbled down with a Thumbelina pencil, a swathe of rules, ditching all farm implements, but the shovels insisting that each side be limited to 40 players a piece sketching the Katherine Mansfield Bob wigs they must all wear at the starting whistle and adding such enticing details as the offside rule and the so called pencil Gambit. intriguingly the Magnus was busy on his tuffet codifying the rules of the game on the very day in October 1922 that Katherine Mansfield fetched up at good juifs Institute for the harmonious development of man in Fontainebleau, where she was hoping to find treatment for the tuberculosis that was killing her. And she did find treatment for gurdjieff. The one time carpet salesman and ridiculous old fraud had her chopping up carrots in the middle of the night and sleeping when he allowed her to sleep in a loft above the cow barn, reasoning that the heavy stench of gathered cows would benefit her health. She was dead by January.

by another uncanny coincidence, she died on the day that the mundane makers blew a whistle to begin the first ever Mansfield tournament where the game was played in its modern form. In the final, the blister lane Gallo peasantry beat to the Pang Hill orphanage groundsman that convincingly with a tally of 43 broken bones to six, more than double the bloodshed when measured in piles and three players and trails eaten by vultures as opposed to 12. Next week, we'll be looking at various tactical tips including the next Tories double shovels are the wind pipe, and how top teams limber up for a needle match by reading Katherine Mansfield in a German pension allowed huddled around a gas stove on a wild winter night.

Time for one of our occasional occasional conjuring trick things. So I'm going to start again. Right continuing with the show, this is from a book. This is not by me This is from a book of kind of parlor games, and so on magic tricks published in the late 19th century. This one is called the rotation of the globe, and it sounds very, very exciting. When you next chance to eat an egg for breakfast, do not fail to try the following experiment. It is one which always succeeds and is productive of much amusement to the company. moisten slightly with water the rim of your plate and in the center paint with the yolk of the egg a son with golden rays. By the aid of this simple operators, you will be in a position to illustrate so clearly that a child can comprehend it the double movement of the earth which revolves simultaneously around the sun and on its own axis. All you have to do is to place the empty half shell of your egg on the rim of the plate and keeping this latter Julie sloped by a slight movement of the wrist as maybe needful. You will see the eggshell begin to revolve rapidly on its own axis. At the same time traveling around the plate. It is hardly necessary to remark that the eggshell will not travel up hill and the plate must therefore be gradually shifted around as well as sloped so that the shell may always have an inshore tube descending plane before it. The slight cohesion caused by the water which moistens the plate counteracts the centrifugal force and so prevents the eggshell falling off the edge of the plate.

So if you follow those instructions next breakfast time is going to be pretty enjoyable in your house I think to end the show this week, a couple of quotations and this is from a story by Seabury Quinn, which I think is a pseudonym, but whose it is I'm not sure this is from the Monkey God. The wind was howling like 1000 banshees with ulcerated teeth, lashing the tall somber cedars which lines the milstead driveway till they bent almost doubled before its force and hurling sheets of mingled snow and sleet against the house walls and window panes. The entire north wall of the milstead mansion was encrusted with storm castings as the professor muffled to the eyes in his motoring coat and with his first cap Paul Well obz is forced his way through the tempest to the spot beneath the library window. The wind was howling like 1000 banshees with ulcerated teeth. The banshees get ulcerated teeth. I don't know Seabury Quinn obviously thought so. Actually, that's all we have time for. So there is no further quote. But there'll be another one next week, I expect. I do hope you've enjoyed the show. And come back next week. See you then bye bye
