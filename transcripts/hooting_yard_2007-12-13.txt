My name is Frank resonance 104 point four f m, or on your computer. If I collapse into a state of coughing, drooling wretchedness, because I fell I'm coming down with a cold. I'm not asking for your sympathy, I'm just explaining why. The prose that follows may be interrupted by gasping noises. And I'm going to begin with I'm going to begin with this. I've never been a fan of comic books, nor have I developed a taste for graphic novels. I can admire the skill and inventiveness, but somehow I can't drum up genuine enthusiasm. Of course, as a child, I had my weekly diet of comics, including Pepsi, Pepsi factory at tectorum memorabilia, and the dinky. But when I discovered proper books, I was smitten by pros, and there was no turning back. Until last week, that is when I discovered a fantastic comic featuring the cartoon superhero laundry bag boy, I have to admit, it's been a revelation and I'm smitten all over again, this time by cruden cack handed drawings and by storylines which have surely been devised by a dribbling toddler. Yet there is a majestic genius about laundry bag boy, his adventures, his scrapes, his pratfalls, his laundry bag that I find irresistible. The comic I picked up absent mindedly for him where it had been discarded on a bench under a sycamore by a path in a park was fat and dog eared and threatened by rainfall. I thought no more than to carry it to the nearest municipal waste bin and consign it to oblivion. But the waste bins had been commanded by an avant garde art project, organized by a man called Simon whose name was Peter, just like one of the apostles of Christ. But whereas the apostles were, as Charles bradlaugh 1833 to 1891, observed, quote, illiterate half starved visionaries in some dark corner of a Greek Syrian slum, and quote, The artists Simon and his pals were goatee bearded trendies from shortage destined to rot in hell. Before they rotted, they had filled all the municipal waste bins in the park with some kind of compacted orange substance. How does concrete rendering the bins unusable? According to leaflets available from a temporary kiosk, this art intervention was a quote courageous statement about Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib and the war on terror. Unquote. much as I would have liked to wander through the park from bin to been contemplating this thought provoking work, I found that my thoughts were paralyzed rather than provoked, so instead, I took shelter from the downpour under a derelict bandstand, and began to leave through the comic. I am so glad I did. Issue 10 volume 34 of laundry bag boy contained a couple of short strips about Douglas the pig, who was I learned laundry bag boys pet pig, and a few pages of adverts and promotions for other publications. The bulk of the comic, however, was a single full length comic strip adventure called laundry bag Boy, that shock attack years. Now, just as in my adulthood, I've never been a comics buff, nor have I ever cared much or at all for Shaq attack, the British jazz funk band who had hits in the 1980s with night birds and down on the street, among others. Frankly, their smooth path left me cold when first I heard it, and still does two decades on. listeners who disagree with me and who wish to champion the music of Shaq attack and show me the error of my ways are invited to argue their case in the comment section of the hooting yard website. www dot hooting yard.org but I'll only pay attention to contributions which shake me to the core and force me to reassess my entire Weltanschauung. Those are the stakes. So be very careful before you tap that keyboard and hit Send. The plot of the story in the comic such as it is, posits that for a period of seven years precisely which is a maddeningly unspecified laundry bag boy

acts as a kind of familiar to the Dallas ditch water jazz funk Esther's favorite remain unaware of his presence, but he's always there haunting them, watching over them in a patch of shadow on stage, or perched up in the rafters of the recording studio, breathing softly cluttering his laundry bag, which is sometimes empty, but more often, about two thirds full of filthy unmentionables long overdue for the washing machine. With his yellow hair and blazing eyes, we the readers can always spot the superhero. But to the shock attack personnel, including roadies, sound engineers and hangers on he might as well be invisible. You may wonder why none of them smell upon emanating from his laundry bag at times when it is about two thirds full. This is because one of laundry bag boys superpowers is an ability to pluck from the empty air, a canister of air freshener and spray the contents of his noise and bag until it smells of roses and honey and lavender, and poppy coral and citrus mango and pumpkin and nutria doll and peach and apple and one other fragrance, the name of which I can't be bothered to look up right at this minute. More than one critic reviewing a shark attack concert is claimed to have dubbed them the sweetest smelling band in the world. Although whether this really happened outside the pages of the comic book or not, is something I'm less interested in. Sorry, it's not something I'm sorry, I'm going to start that sentence again. I have a little cough. a sip of tea. This is live radio you see. More than one critic reviewing a shark attack concert is claimed to have dubbed them the sweetest smelling band in the world. Although whether this really happened outside the pages of the comic book or not, is something I'm competent. At it's not something I'm competent to assert or deny, for I don't care one way or the other. I'm less interested in shark attack than in laundry bag boy himself. I have read mountains of prose in my time books upon books upon books, but never have I fallen so deeply under the spell of a fictitious being. Despite looking from some angles, like an incompetent portrait of the columnist Peter Hitchens, laundry bag boy with his aforementioned yellow hair and blazing eyes, and his pet pig Douglas and his conjured up air fresheners. And his laundry bag stands in my view above the heads of Emma Bovary or Oscar crease, or santro Panzer, or Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, or Hans castile soap, or Molly bloom, or Murphy or Malloy, or Malone. Or Tyrone slow throw up, or Dr. slop or the widow Waldman, or Ishmael or Ahab or pangloss or Percival battle booth, or Bartleby the Scrivener or trilby, or Svengali, or Hazel Blears, or Gregor samsa, or Don Fabricio corbera Prince of Salina or Batman or Robin the boy wonder, or Robin Hood, or Humphry clinker, or Pip, or Magwitch, or Jeffrey Fermin, or SNF white, or the Mad Arab Abdullah Al has read, or pinky brown or child Swan, or Quentin derwood, or Martin chuzzlewit, or foo, Manchu, or thousands of other fictional characters. He is a true superhero, and yet has a humanity that is palpable, not literally palpable. Of course, that would be stretching my enthusiasm too far, but figuratively, also, I would have and had already covered during that very first skim reading, sheltering from the rain under the ruined bandstand in the park. As I became transfixed by the adventures of laundry bag boys track attack years. When I got home, I reread the comic with closer attention three or four times I think, I learned more about laundry bag boy that he had many more superpowers and ones that made the air freshener thing seemed like a party trick. He could for example, Mel his brainwaves with those of Douglas the pig giving him an Extra human perspective on any given situation. He could count the number of pins in a pin cushion with unerring accuracy in a split second from behind the dry stone wall. His head,

including the yellow hair and blazing eyes could expand to four times its normal size for up to an hour at a time. Secret flaps on his laundry bag could be manipulated in such a way that it was turned into an inflatable dingey with plastic oars, a couple of emergency flares, a compass operative on this and other planets, and a waterproof cabin for Douglas the pig. Strictly speaking, possession of such a laundry bag is not a superpower as such, it smacks more of the kind of gadgetry deployed by fictional spies, such as James Bond, who was of course named after an ornithologist, author of birds of the West Indies, first published in 1936, and in its fifth edition, still in print today. on one page of the comic laundry bag boy is seen studying a copy of James Bond's book while loafing backstage at a shark attack concert. This appears to be wholly gratuitous, as no important plot developments hinged upon it, and indeed, there is a marked absence of any other ornithological content whatsoever. There are not even any birds seen in the sky, always depicted as a uniform pale, blue, cloudless, flat, and artificial. I soon learned that such a sky is a constant throughout the canon, for I was so enthused by the shock attack years that I took myself off to a specialist supplier of comic books, and bought as many other laundry bag boy titles as I could fit it in my own non laundry bag. Regrettably, Most, if not quite all of the stories had a subplot related in some way to jazz funk, though not specifically to Shaq attack. And yet this did not dim my glee. I did use that either the writer or the artist, neither of whose names appeared in any of the comics, as far as I could see, was a devoted of that devilish music and lack the self control to expunge their aberrant leanings from the otherwise stupendous stories. Yet how often we forgive writers and artists for what are after all minor irritants. For example, I've never been able to stomach Dennis beer pints, infuriating habit of conflating dish cloths with other kinds of rags and sponges. And yet I'm still able to enjoy his verse for its vigor and punk teleo I feel the same about laundry bag boy matches I might wish that William Hill stones bassoon Sonata se could stand as a substitute for true colors by level 42. Another thing I've noticed about laundry bag boy is that he never blinks. This may be a limitation of the cartoon strip medium, or it may be that his eyes are Uber eyes piercing an all seeing and never for a moment at rest. And there's a lot for him to look at. Although the quality of the drawing is scrappy and fumbled, occasionally looking as if created by a Cretan on a damaged actress sketch. Throughout the series, there's an incredible amount of detail. The sky may be shown as flat and birthless and cloudless. But everywhere else in these pictures is a magnificent clutter of things. Just to take a picture at random, consider the opening frame from laundry bag boy gets into the groove with Herbie Hancock issue for volume 28 examining this whether vincula human scope reveals in a rectangle taking up half the page potatoes bloaters the weird stone of Brisbane gaming 14 hours dental floss diagrams, cotton pins, pour grind furballs rotating things custard muck shoe laces, coat hangers, an aerodrome, flame retardant fabric samples, snappy cap tin cans, a glazed bowl, a Viking helmet, a syrinx a rickshaw geese, pots and pans.

It really is extraordinarily packed with detail. laundry bag boy himself does not appear in this opening frame of the cartoon, and nor does Herbie Hancock. their absence at the beginning is a crucial part of the plot. But I will not spoil it for you by explaining why. While I was buying up back numbers in the comic shop, I took the opportunity to pump the proprietor for more information about laundry bag boy, intriguingly, the shop was run not by a geeky nerdy nerd geek, the kind we tend to associate with such establishment, but by a batty Crone with a Quaker Lee air about her, her hair was white and wild, and she had a decided plum in her mouth. She was kind enough to offer me from a somewhat battered tin, a choice of arrowroot and Garibaldi biscuits to match while I browse the cardboard boxes packed with comics, unlikely as it seemed, she knew everything there was to know about my newfound fictional hero, a walking encyclopedia of laundry bag boy law and learning are common and in ponder abilities, facts and figures. One thing she told me in particular had me quite perplexed. In spite of the popularity of the yellow haired, blazing eyed superhero, there was no official worldwide fan club to which I could apply. This seemed anomalous, when there are such organizations devoted to virtually everyone you can think of from fictional detectives such as Sherlock Holmes and solar Pons to real detectives, like Sir Ian Blair and kargh pan of the yard. From sir Granville bantock to Rock Hudson, from Lascelles Abercrombie to Spider Man, from Mike Huckabee to Ayn Rand. From Brutus Maximus to Popeye. From Arianna Huffington to Ringo Starr from Krishnan guru Murthy to Tuesday Weld. Yet in this seething maelstrom of often ill advised fandom, there was an unfathomable void where laundry bag boy ought to have been. Well, I have decided to correct this preposterous state of affairs. Tomorrow at 5:15am sharp, I will be striding onto a podium by the perimeter fence of Pang Hill our sanctuary and announcing the formation of the official laundry bag boy fan club. If you're unable to be there, please write to me at hooting dot yard at Google mail.com. With Gosh, it's about time laundry bag boy had his own fan club as the subject header and nominate yourself for an official post in the organization. You can make up your own grand sounding title, grand sounding title. A roster of fan club officers will be posted on the hooting yard website. And badges will be issued into course

recently discovered shoved into a potato sack in an outbuilding on a dismal farmyard. The manuscript entitled an essay concerning a bird perched on a promontory has been authenticated as the work of Dobson. Why it was never published as a pamphlet is anybody's guess. Still, it will be out of print by now, so it hardly matters. But I'm very pleased to have been granted permission in the form of a grubby piece of paper up into an equally grubby piece of cardboard to recite an extract from the essay here. So without further ado. Correct practice in the matter of the observation of a bird perched upon a promontory is a matter of the utmost importance. When I told people I was going to make this the subject of a pamphlet, I was startled by the vituperation of their reactions. I had it seemed touched a nerve for crying out loud, Dobson said one acquaintance, whatever other qualities you may possess in terms of ornithological knowledge, you are a profoundly ignorant man. Why I doubt to even know the difference between a coot and a more hand, let alone more exotic birds, such as fork tailed storm petrels, anhingas, blue crowned Mata Mata godwit loons, Noddy's bobolinks, and buff colored night jars. To save yourself from humiliation at the hands of the avian establishment. You should abandon this project and instead write an essay on something you know about, such as the construction of yurts. And this was fairly typical of the hostility I met with but I laugh off such ill informed abuse. I laugh it off melodramatically, as if I were a villain in a 19th century Italian operetta Count ghido perhaps in bakos, less scrappy Xia Tang de my waxed. mustachios twitching as I cackle and plunger stiletto into the breast of the cardinal enact to seem for such invective from those who doubt my ornithological expertise sways me not one drop for my path. It's worth mentioning at the outset of my essay, however, for reasons of both vanity and revenge, well do I know the sound of the clanking trains of vengeance, for I have heard them often and are known. As for vanity. Well, that is a dish I have gobbled up with gusto, like particularly toothsome soup enriched with gourmet crew Tom's, I regret to say that my pamphlet, the first in a series of 26 bagatelles, devoted to a celebration of the humble crew, Tom is now out of print. I have not yet written the subsequent 25 pamphlets, for it seems more urgent to address praxis in the matter of bird stroke promontory observation. Why should this be so? The plain fact is that as I wander about the coastline of my bailiwick, I'm often struck by the incompetent manner in which this activity is carried out. I dare say if we were dealing with a more trivial matter, such as say, the buffing with a rag of a bobsled championship medal or the invocation of an Aztec gold, I would not bother my ugly large head about it. But what could be more important than observing birds perched upon palm trees? friggin your brain for as long as you wish, but I suggest you will in the end be forced to accept that the answer that question is nothing or better, nothing Dobson. You are of course correct as always. So let us start from first principles. I'm talking about trousers. If you're going to set out to look at a gala or a couture a bufflehead by the edge of the vast and inexplicable sea, where corduroys It matters not if they're ill fitting baggy, big in the bottom or even stained with stains of immoral besmirched. You can't go wrong in corduroys. While we're on the subject, it's widely believed that the textile is so named from the French called Du Bois, that is the cloth of the king otter twaddle. This and many other myths about fabrics are comprehensively exploded in my pamphlet, a disquisition upon the various types of cloth from which Crowder's may be woven together with some pictures of human Cronin out of print, where the corduroy question is addressed in a footnote on page 44. And again in the invoice where I quote liberally from the catalogs of textile manufacturing concerns from over 16 different countries. So prodigious was my research when I buckled down to it after years of procrastination. I cannot count the number of ways I found to keep putting off the work, doing the work I knew I was born to do. I took up hamster husbandry,

Frank Key  24:57
I took a needle and thread and Dan things which did not need darling. I studied maps my brow furrowed with no intention of ever visiting the places so mapped. I trampled through gos. I worked my way through the canon of traditional nursery rhymes and baked each pie mentioned there in. But eventually I saw sent and got down to work and went to the library and obtained the key to the basement where we kept all the textile manufacturing catalogs from many lands, and I read each and every one making notes in my little notepad with my little note taking pencil, soon worn to a stub last, but not before I had garnered a massive fact. And not just fact, but unassailable fact, as if there's a difference when one considers the strict definition of effect, as I did and do usually, unless I've not eaten enough breakfast and thus am prey to becoming a tad light headed, as can happen on a Wednesday. For reasons I shall not go into here. Fast tucked comfortably into a pair of corduroy trousers, the keen observer of birds perched upon promontories is ready to take the next step in the practice. This involves combing one's hair, it will be argued that there is little point combing one's hair. If one is to stride hatless out to the coast, where howling sea winds and schools of spray will disheveled even the most carefully preened hair style. Such arguments hold no water with me. For I confess that in this area of personal grooming, I am fanatical. It is true that I have not combed my own hair since I was 10 years old. But that does not mean I cannot hand down absolute rules to the seething mass of humanity from aloft my job sonian perk, much like czar issuing a use case and as mercilessly for the purpose of molding your mop into a neat and tidy state before going off to the promontory in hopes of spotting a p wit or a swift or a 10 x lock. I recommend the use of a tortoise shell comb with a decorative handle of filigree and bippity bit I suppose in Extremis, a tree plastic comb one given away as a free gift with a cheap pair of socks will do if you're the sort of person who wears cheap socks. I know I am. Earlier I said that I have heard the trains of vengeance Clank. I repeat that here for emphasis. Stage three has to be said is critical and not for those faint of heart. With your own theological kits stowed in your own theological kitbag, you need to propel yourself from the homely comforts of your heart out into the wild, continuing on until you reach a suitably bird haunted promontory. This may involve passing through fearsome and spooky forest or across mist in crowded malls riddled with wolf packs on negotiating a big and busy motorway, the underpasses of which have been flooded by recent tempests, or avoiding roadside bandits armed with staves and blunder buses, or other such ordeals of the journey in Seoul. For all your pattern of modernity, you might as well be a grunting Savage, toiling through the waist 10,000 years ago, preparing to cast your uncomprehending eyes upon an elemental site for what could be more suggestive of the primitive, the pre human than a raven on a rock or a bitter not a boulder, or a sprite on an outcrop, at the edge of the land at the rim of the world, battered by the winds and staring out to sea. I do not want you to answer that question for it. Maybe you have up your sleeve competing images, possibly involving oozing slime and pterodactyls, which render my own less than fab that would never do remember who is the pamphleteer here, and who the reader. I will assume we have reached a promontory and that there is a bird perched upon it. Some swivel eyed members of what we might call the bird obsessed community will insist that you'll be able to identify what sort of bird you're looking at. They will want you to take in at a glance such features as the beak or bill and coloration and thickness of feathers and size and shape of head and wings a bit and arrive at a snap informed judgment regarding bird type. God knows there are thousands upon thousands of specific bird types for your puny brain to compute, in that at a glance moment. And I suppose we can admire to some extent the person with impeccably combed hair and corduroy trousers who announces that is a category or oh look yonder upon the promontory purchase a Sandpiper, but at the same time, we should be aware that they're showing off

Frank Key  29:57
and they're very likely the kind of bumptious bird You know all those who would cut us dead at a cocktail party in an elegant drawing room? I hasten to add that I'm not speaking from my personal experience here, as I've never been treated with contempt by an ornithologist at any kind of party, cocktail or otherwise. The only important thing once you're standing near the promontory looking at a perching bird, is that you're clear it is a bird or not, say a squirrel or a lugworm, or a pebble. I have no many who through incorrect practice, have made such errors. And I cannot really blame the authorities for displaying giant photographs of them with their names and addresses printed in big block capitals on billboards and hoardings throughout the capital city. As part of the five year plan dubbed we must ridicule citizens lacking knowledge of birds. This has been one of the most successful campaign so far devised by the regime. And now its long term benefits and its short term benefits are unfathomable. I for one would rather live on a diet of prunes than see it reversed.
