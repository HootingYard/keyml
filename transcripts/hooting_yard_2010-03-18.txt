You know that sound it's the Caucasian lullaby by slap happy and Henry cow from 1975 which can mean only one thing it hooting yard on the air. With me, Frank key reading to you for roughly half an hour. A duck in a pond, a pond near a swamp. Sometimes the duck walks across the mud from the pond to the swamp, and standing on the edge looks into the stagnant filth, like a duck Narcissus. on the horizon, there are trees, large beech, Sycamore pine, having gazed unblinking as its reflection, blurry blurry, the duck turns about and walks back to the pond into which it clashes, and oftentimes attends itself so to a passer by only its fundament and feet of visible, its head and the upper body submerged in the water. When a breeze gusts as it usually does, the leaves on trees on the horizon rustle. If the breeze becomes a gale, the trees sway once the wind grew so strong one of them a beach crashed to the ground, it's top most twigs and branches falling into the swamp at the swamps edge. Fortunately for the duck, it was in the pond when this happened. The sky was black for the wind was howling in the night, and there were no stars to be seen. Because of clouds. The duck was terrified. If ever you passed by that pond trucks and stale bread crust to the duck. If you're on your way to the trees, to take measurements, or to carve your initials and those of your sweetheart into the bark on a trunk, be sure to skirt the swamp. Even the stoutest and most voluminous wading boots will not save you from sinking into the Merkin slime, glob glob glob. If you take the proper route to the trees, you will pass the Memorial Garden where stones and piles of pebbles and rugged wooden crosses mark those whose souls the swamp has claimed. The duck has seen some of them from the safety of its pond as they sink flailing and helpless and screaming. It is a traumatized duck.

Here are two snippets from a splendid book I read recently, the sun and the moon. The remarkable troll account of hoaxes show men juggling journalists and the lunar man back in the 19th century New York by Matthew Goodman, highly recommended get it from your local library. Buy it indeed. The sun on the moon by Matthew Goodman. Anyway, here are two snippets from it, which I much enjoyed. And he quotes Lewis Gaylord Clarke on Edgar Allan Poe. I'm mortified but impotent litteratur and ambitious author Ling perhaps have a small volume of feet and lamentable trash. I'm not entirely sure who Louis Gaylord Clarke was. But Edgar Allan Poe's name has outlived his the other snippet which I much enjoyed, and minded to conduct inquiries into someone called Dr. Henry Hall Sherwood of New York, a man with controversial electro magnetic series, who apparently would become known for his savage rotary magnetic machine, which we claimed could cure all manner of diseases from rheumatism to herpes and tuberculosis. Gosh

This is the first of two stories featuring Alger Hiss and Whittaker chambers. Fact or fancy, you decide. Alger Hiss lay sprawled on the jetty in his wetsuit. Sorry, let me read that again. Alger Hiss lay sprawled on the jetty in his wet suit. It was a stylish and elegant suit from Gambit SM three and it was sopping wet because some minutes earlier, Alger Hiss had toppled into the river basin inadvertently and had to hold himself back onto the jetty with no little exertion. He was still painting and making a half hearted attempt to wring out his soaking cuffs, when who should come striding along from the direction of the ice cream kiosk, but Whittaker chambers. Alger Hiss hailed his alleged pal with a weedy wave of his best suit sleeved arm. Whittaker chambers waved back and came lolloping along the jetty. His suit was less stylish, less elegant, and its crumpling was born of neglect rather than fashion. How now his, he said, I see you've been for a swim in the basin. Not so chambers, his replied his panting some motivated. I'm afraid I fell in clumsily. With a good chambers removed a shred of lettuce from between his blackened rotting teeth and flicked it to the ground, but it sank gently in the air and came to land on the Natty shoulder piece of algebra hisses suit. Do you insult me chambers for my clumsiness, cried hiss shattered and woebegone. Forgive me his said chambers. I did not aim that letter shredded you and it's falling upon you was as accidental as your toppling into the basin. On this occasion, I shall believe you chambers said his marshaling his dignity, though he still lay sprawled, though you cannot claim to have been distracted as i was when i toppled. Oh, such train chambers. And what was it that distracted your attention and caused you to lose your footing at the very edge of the basin? my gaze was fixed upon the immensity of the heavens above us, rather than it and as it more wisely would have been upon the muddy path along which I trod, said his a glimmer of understanding flashed across Whittaker chambers his face. Ah, he said, you were looking up hoping to spot perhaps a Soviet spy plane scanning our terrain for valuable intelligence. Not at all, replied his clambering at last his feet, I was lost in contemplation. Whittaker chambers looked at his alleged pal in some surprise. What is there to contemplate? he asked. The sky is blue and has clouds in it and futures are ugly now and then birds, and if we're lucky spy planes, but Oh, chambers chambers said his interrupting him. Be mindful of what charmers said, what is seen maybe nothing to what is unseen, for what is seen is limited by the range of our instruments. What is unseen has no limit. And though all which the eye of man can take in or his fancy can grasp was swept away, there might still remain as ample of field over which the Divinity may expatriate, and which we may have people within numerable worlds. If the whole visible creation were to disappear, it would leave a solitude behind it, but to the infinite minds that can take in the whole system of nature, this solitude might be nothing, a small unoccupied point in that immensity which surrounds it, and which he may have filled with the wonders of His omnipotence. Though this earth would we burned up, though the trumpet of its dissolution was sounded, though young sky would have passed away as a scroll, and every visible glory which the finger of the Divinity has inscribed on it, what do we put out forever, an event so awful to us and to every world in our vicinity, by which so many suns would be extinguished? And so many varied scenes of life and of population would rush into forgetfulness. What is it in the high scale of the Almighty's workmanship, a mere shred which those scattered Nothing would leave the universe of God one entire scene of greatness and of majesty.

Though this earth and these heavens were to disappear, there are other worlds which roll afar, the light of other suns shines upon them, and the sky, which mantle's is garnished with other stars. Is it presumption to say that the moral world extends to these distant and Unknown Regions, that they are occupied with people, that the charities have home and have neighborhood flourish there, that the praises of God as they are lifted up, and his goodness rejoiced in that piety has their its temples and its offerings, and the richness of the divine attributes is there felt and admired by intelligent worshipers? Alger his paused, and Whittaker chambers took the opportunity to suggest that they stroll together arm in arm to the ice cream kiosk. His nodded in agreement and continued and what is this world in the immensity which teams with them, and what are they who occupied the universe at large, would suffer as a little in its splendor and variety by the destruction of our planet as the verge and sublime magnitude of a forest would suffer by the fall of a single leaf. The leaf quivers on the branch which supported it lies at the mercy of the slightest accident, a breath of wind tears it from its stem, and it lights on the stream of water which passes underneath. Just as my dislodged shred of lettuce vited upon your Natty shoulder, said chambers. Indeed, said his in a moment of time, the life we know by the microscope IT teams with is extinguished, and an occurrence so insignificant in the eye of man, and on the scale of his observation carries in it to the mariadb, which people with little leaf and event is terrible and as decisive as the destruction of a world. Now, on the grand scale of the universe, we the occupiers of this ball, which performs its little round among the sons and the systems that astronomy has unfolded, we may feel the same littleness and the same insecurity. we differ from the leaf only in this circumstance, that it would require the operation of greater elements to destroy us. But these elements exist. The fire which rages within may lift its devouring energy to the surface of our planet, and transform it into one wide and wasting volcano, the sudden formation of elastic matter in the bowels of the earth, and it lies within the agency of unknown substances To accomplish this, by exploded into fragments. The exhalation of noxious air from below may impart a variance to the air that is around us, it may affect the delicate proportion of its ingredients, and the whole of animated nature by wither and die under the malignity of a tainted atmosphere. A blazing comet may cross this fated planet in its orbit, and realize all the terrors which superstition has conceived of it. We cannot anticipate with precision the consequences of an event which every astronomer must know to lie within the limits of chance and probability, it may hurry our globe towards the sun, or drag it to the outer regions of the planetary system, or give it a new axis of revolution. And the effect which I shall simply announce, without explaining it, would be to change the place of the ocean and bring another mighty flood upon our islands and continents. These are changes which may happen in a single instant of time, and against which nothing known in the present system of things provides us with any security. They might not annihilate the earth, but they would unpeople it and we who trade it surface with such firm and assured footsteps are at the mercy of devouring elements, which, if let loose upon us by the hand of the Almighty would spread solitude and silence and death over the dominions of the world. Your own footsteps were not so firm and assured when you toppled into the river basin, said chambers, but I should not teach you. Let me buy you a choc ice. The pair had arrived at the ice cream kiosk. Just one thing

added chambers. When you speak of the Almighty, I assume you refer to Starling hash chambers hist his putting his finger to his lips. Be careful. The fellow behind the ice cream kiosk counter may be a federal agent. Whittaker chambers slapped his forehead to dramatically damaged his you are right of course, I am sorry. to be on the safe side he made a great show as he purchased two truck ices of saluting the paper Stars and Stripes fluttering from the kiosks shingle roof. Mounting there, confectionery was cold and chilly is the Siberian steps. Alger Hiss and Whittaker chambers walked off together in the blazing sunshine.

There's some further reading for that story, if you wish. discourses on the Christian revelation viewed in connection with the modern astronomy by Thomas charmers, dd and lld, published in 1817. Parts of that piece would take them directly from traumas. Here's the second of two, Alger Harrison Whittaker chambers stories. This one is entitled chambers and hiss at the Chamber of hissing Alger Harris and Whittaker chambers were skulking along a corridor a top secret intelligence facility under cover of darkness. When they heard from a heavily padlocked chamber, the unmistakable sound of hissing What do you suppose that hissing sound is his whispered chambers? It sounds like a rising tangle of asks. I very much doubt that it is the hissing of ASPs chambers, replied his consider where we are with a could chambers looked perplexed. You perplex me hiss, he said, How can I know where we are? When the entire point about the siting of this top secret intelligence facility is that it is unmarked upon any map. And that to get here, we have to crawl through subterranean tunnels which twisted and turned in such convolutions that all sense of direction. Indeed, all sense of mental balance is lost and lost utterly. Outer his smile that his alleged friend and stooped to remove from the hollowed out he'll have his shoe, a small mechanism, fitting easily into the palm of his elegant hand. That looks much like a compass. By heavens, his his chambers, you have a compass? Not so chambers, replied his. This is in fact a miniature savage rotary magnetic machine, akin to the one devised by Dr. Henry Hall Sherwood of New York, but designed for quite a different purpose from his original. The pair were now directly outside the chamber door, and the hissing sound was louder and more history than ever. Brilliant, his whispered chambers to use a magnetic machine of American design to help facilitate the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Starling would approve such cunning. But what does it tell us? Well, chambers said his mouth the savagery of its magnetism and rotation, which increases the closer we get to the door of the chamber. If I am not mistaken, beyond that door, is the bottomless Viper pit of Gar Whittaker chambers his eyes nearly popped out of his head, the bottomless Viper pit of God did you say his he said I did. Chambers said his. But But, but how in the name of Lenin, Alger Hiss told his alleged friend that the time for explanations would come later. For now he said it was enough that they had located the top secret bottomless and vitae pit of Gar it was time to turn back make their way through the twisty turny subterranean tunnels and meet up with their Soviet contact in heavy disguise the cocktail bar of a swish hotel he stowed the savage rotary magnetic machine back in his false heel and take Which could chambers by his shabbily suited arm led him away from the mysterious door, behind which the hissing of untold numbers of vipers continued growing fainter and fainter as the Judo skulked away along the corridor.

Regular listeners will know that I wasn't here last week I was in fact in Flanders. And while I was away, an important anniversary occurred, and I was very grateful to Richard Carter, friend of Charles Darwin, member of the Friends of Charles Darwin, for drawing it to my attention, Richard wrote to me and said, sadly, George Orwell recorded the abandonment of his egg count in his diary entry for the 13th of March 1940. Again, regular listeners will know that we've occasionally been keeping track of all well and his egg counting. But anyway, this is what he wrote 70 years ago, on the 13th of March, have now lost accurate count of the eggs, and she'll have to close the egg account book, which however, gives an accurate account stretching over seven months useful for future reference. From the milk man's account. It appears the hens have laid 270 eggs since the 29th of January 1940. About six weeks ago, yesterday 10 it is now difficult to sell eggs as there is a glut social put some in waterglass George Orwell's egg counting lasted much longer than my own pitiful attempt at a squirrel count. And he was surely correct and note how useful it would be for future reference. I'm sure all hooting og listeners will share my sense of loss, knowing there are no further egg tallies to pour over. Something else of relevance to my trip to Flanders. devoted listeners will know that I'm always on the lookout for boosters of one sort or another. I don't really care what kind of booster it is nor what it's designed to boost. It's entirely possible that my enthusiasm is stirred simply by the sound of the words boost and booster. Broadly speaking, I would have heard that you can't go wrong if your sentence has boost in it somewhere, even if it doesn't make sense, for example, with L'Oreal's light reflecting booster technology, whatever that may be. Anyway, a while ago I employed a team of boffins to analyze the neurological responses of a sample of listeners. The results though difficult to clarify, buried as they were in a vast pile of inexplicable data show that magnificently pleasurable brain tingling occurred in seven out of 10 people irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity, sock size, religious or political affiliation, all the angle of the ears towards their wireless set. Whenever I declaimed in sprightly tones, the word boost and boosters. further tests show that the remaining three out of 10 persons each had so called bothin resistant brains. Apparently, the cranial integuments of such persons send out weird wild rays or beams of some unknown substance which thoroughly before mimics the dials and truckers on the boffins conical scanners. Anyway, the reason I mentioned all this is because during my stay in Flanders, I could barely walk 10 paces upon the cobbles without seeing posters with kind of Roy Lichtenstein lettering, which announced Belgacom boost hat internet weather Belgacom boost anything other than internet I'm not sure, but I wouldn't put it past them.

One of the most Common difficulties facing newcomers to the teachings of trebizond. Oh Cole pepper is the complete absence anywhere of bougie coupled with the almost terrifying prevalence throughout of Woogie in his magisterial, if incoherent syncretic Glossary of the way of trebizond dough Culpepper, JK pox devote some 300 pages to what he calls the boogie woogie conundrum. One can argue that there is no conundrum but that doesn't stop pox harping on about it, as ever, he is flamboyant, and one must admire his refusal to define his terms, as if in doing so the magic if magic it is would leech out of them. When thunderclaps and wolves how he writes, when the sage is withered on the lake and gigantic mutant crustaceans come up clattering onto the sand banks. Then Then, my sweet dear ones, is when we are most tempted to admit into our souls, some sort of bougie squash, The very thought underfoot as one might have fig during a fig gullet. No, there is not and never has been and never will be bougie if we follow the way with eyes brighten brows clean, there is only Woogie blended, blossoming and blanketing at once tough as nails and chewy is the king and queen of toffees. So we are taught by trebizond Oh Cole pepper, and so we have embroidered upon our pullovers link arms and sing as snow falls and tinkly things tinkle sing. pox does not go on to say what song it is his readers and students should be singing. To do so may have been psychologically impossible for him. For as we know he was when young expelled from the Conservatoire before his studies had properly began following the incident, described in Pages 45 to 64 of pebble heads best selling paperback, the gummed up tuber and the worm Eton's.

That's the end of this week's hooting yard. I had a sudden thought that perhaps I read that piece two weeks ago. If I did, consider it a sort of mini repeat. Maybe I didn't. I don't know my memory is failing these days. I obviously need more of the Flanders air and visit the website. www dot hooting yard.org there are some books you can buy of four different books of various hooting yard pieces. You can donate to hooting yard. If everyone who listens to this as a podcast donated a pound, I'd be a wealthy man. But otherwise, I'll be back next week with some more stuff perhaps even another story about Alger Hiss and Whittaker chambers. We shall see bye bye
