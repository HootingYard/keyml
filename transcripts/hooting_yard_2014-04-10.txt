This is resonance one on 4.4 fm. My name is Frank key and this is this week's edition of hooting yard on the air. What is it today the 10th of April and almost almost 10 years ago, on the 14th of April 2004 was the very first episode of hooting yard. So it's extraordinary to think that I've been babbling into a microphone almost every week for a decade, which is quite a frightening thought. And hundreds of those shows are of course available. Only resonance pod Kutner Well, the resonance archive the podcast archive, you can listen to hours and hours and hours of this stuff. Should you so desire. So it's a shame that the anniversary falls in the middle of the week as a party so you know, this week's show and next week show are kind of strangling either side of the 10th anniversary but yes, 10 years of hooting odd what a thought. And what would that a get on with the with this week's show, then really hadn't we hadn't I. And there are two essential books for your reading list, which I would like to advise you on. The first is Mr. Keyes, shorter potty brief, brief lived extract of which I have been reading on the show over the last few months. And that is published by constable books later in the year, sixth of November, apparently. So it's quite a long time to wait. But it's written and it's in press at the moment. And don't worry, I will remind you to make sure you buy it as a Christmas gift for everyone you know, and even for people who don't know you can just buy up hundreds of copies and hand them out in the street. So that's Mr. Keys. Shorter potty brief, brief lives 500 odd, very short, snippet biographies of famous and infamous and obscure people. The other book is Mr. Keys book of birds. Now, this has not yet actually been written and doesn't have a publisher and really consists only of a few initial extracts on the hooting yard website. But I'm going to read them to you this week. All you need to know about birds, by one who knows. So here's chapter one, the Robin the Robin is a type of bird. It may be found in near spaces perched on a bow. Arrival upon departure from the bow is accomplished by flight flight retrieved by deployment of the wings, a pair. Not all birds are capable of flight, but the Robin is. During parchment, the Robin may be captured by placing over a net attached to one end of a stick. While it is thus prevented from flying away, one can insert a syringe through the net and stand the Robin with a sedative, rendering it unconscious. The neck can then be lifted up and the bird placed in the pocket. One should ensure that the bow from which the Robin is abducted is within a short walking distance of the laboratory or other workspace. If the bird regains consciousness while in the pocket, it will panic and flap about and may well exercise it to wings sufficiently to fly free. On the way into the boundless sky. Upon arrival at the lab, place the stunned bird on a work surface and injected with another dose of the serum calibrated to keep it away with the fairies for a few hours.

various activities can now be carried out with the unconscious Robin. These may be in the spirit of scientific inquiry, or just larking about technically the lark is a different type of burden has nothing to do with locking about, at least not in the present context. If one intends shortly before the Robin wakes up, it's tiny brain woozy to replace it on its bow on a different but nearby bow. It's important that no great harm should come to the bird as a result of the activities, whatever they might be. Small modifications to the unconscious Robin are permissible. For example, plucking out a handful of it feathers for library examination under a microscope at one's leisure, or painting it an entirely different color with a non toxic pigment. But another count should one remove say its head. For in doing so. One will kill the Robin and it will not wake from its induced coma. in carrying out scientific experiments, it's well to bear in mind that the Robin is but one type of bird and one cannot extrapolate from the result of one's experiment. deductions are applicable to all types of birds, not even to all Robbins. It may not be a normal Robin. If simply larking about say by dipping the feet in a pool of ink and then printing a false bird trail across the bedroom ceiling of a wife one is planning to drive insane as in the Patrick Hamilton play gathright, one need not bother whether the Robin is normal or not. The villainous husband in Gaslight did not paint the Santa bird trail, but it's the sort of tactic he might have used had he had access to well unconscious Robin. When replacing the bird on its bow, it will need to be propped upright until it's fully awake. Otherwise it will topple to the ground due to gravitational force use a small structure of interlaced twigs or some such temporary bolster. upon waking, the Robin will probably bistre itself and use it to wings to depart the bow in flight up into the sky until it is quite out of sight. Its destination unknown even to the Robin itself.

Willow warbler. The Willow warbler is a type of bird. As its name suggests, it hangs around in the vicinity of willow trees and it warbles. In the notebook you keep in a waterproof PICHETTE on a lanyard around your neck, there is probably a page headed birds beginning with w i have seen on which you have written a list of birds beginning with W. When you see one of these birds, you either make a tick next to the name or cross it out decisively with your propelling pencil. In order to retrieve this result for the willow warbler then you need to be near willow trees or possibly just one willow tree and you also need to listen out for warbling. If there are no willow trees in sight and you cannot hear anything resembling a warble you are very unlikely to spot a willow warbler. The first thing to do then, is to get yourself close to some willows. Do not forget to take your binoculars with you unless you are blessed with uncommonly piercing vision, in which case you probably have not bothered to buy or rent a pair of binoculars. It may be that you live far out so far from any willows and congenital infirmity forbids you from lengthy travel. In such circumstances, you need not give up all hope of spotting No Willow warbler, the thing to do is to obtain and plant in the ground in your garden, some Willow saplings. If you do not have a garden, choose a patch of Commons as close to your domain as possible and plant the saplings there. You will of course have to wait some years for the saplings to grow into the kind of lush verdant willow trees likely to attract a willow warbler. But while you wait, you can spend profitable time reading up on the bird. So you can be all the more certain you know one when you see one. And of course, reading books about birds can be done in the comfort of your armchair. If you have one, and you need not strain your feeble and debilitated limbs. If you do not have an armchair, you can simply sprawl on the floor. So several other types of birds are known to hang around in the vicinity of willows. This is where your ability to recognize the warbling of a willow warbler becomes critical. Bear in mind, however, that not only do several other types of birds lurk in the Willows, but several other types of birds also warble I'm not going to give you a complete or even a partial list of such birds. So do not ask. What you need to do is learn the distinctive warbling sound made by the willow warbler, which differentiates it from other warbling birds. There might be some tape recordings in your local lending library, or you can interrogate an ornithologist. After matching diligence study, you should be able to recognize the willow warbler with both your eyes and your ears. What you then have to do is drag yourself towards the patch of willows pier intently and prick up your ears and wait for a bird to appear that matches both the sight and sound of the willow warbler. Insofar as you have rammed these concepts into your head, you can then take your notebook out of it Pichet, flip to the required page and either tick or cross out the name of the bird. As we have seen, depending on your physical robustness, or lack thereof, this may take many years to accomplish. But boy oh boy, it'll be worth it with icing on top.

Before we move on to the next chapter of my book of birds, I might call it Mr. Keyes bumper book of birds. I'm not sure half fat a book needs to be before you can call it a bumper book. If you've got any suggestions, let me know. Well, maybe there's a formal definition of bumper, maybe it's I don't know, 400 pages or something. Before we move on with that, though, I'd like to make a kind of resonance based announcement, which is the moment we're interested to know. It says here wetter I think it means weather hasn't been proof read. Anyway, calling all London listeners we're interested to know whether you can receive resonance FM in your area. Some others then had to scribble in with a pencil, not only the H in weather, but the fact that what we obviously mean by that is on 104 point four FM. Many of you as we know listen on your computers to resonance fm.com. But this is about the aerial and the signal strength. So if you're listening on the radio, in London, or in the vicinity of London, it would very much help if you could then go to your computer and go to resonance fm.com forward slash map and drop a marker on the map for obviously for where you are and detail the strength of the signal. This will help to know Whether anyone is listening on the radio and how convenient it is, what have powerful signals, I think I've made that pretty clear. So I'm not going to carry on with that I'm going to tell you instead about the corncrake. The corncrake is a type of bird, it's called is raucous and alarming to gain an idea of how raucous how alarming Imagine you're fast asleep in bed. Because you are obsessed with the rigors of polar exploration. You sleep like Roald Amundsen with your bedroom window wide open in all seasons of the year. Through this open window, flies a corncrake and it comes into land upon your head. Ordinarily, the sensation of its talons digging into your Buffon to steady its perking would awaken you. But you are wearing your thickly woven woolly swaddling sleep helmet as recommended by von straubing z. having suffered from debilitating insomnia for many years, you've studied von Straub and these exciting new discipline of snooze ethics. Now, before retiring, you drink a pint of lukewarm milk of magnesia Picture yourself tossing the contents of your brain into a wooden crate and hammering shot the lid of the crate with 10,000 nails the same number of nails Cornelius Cardew thought sufficient to seal the coffin of imperialism and you don the sleep helmet before hopping, never climbing but hopping into bed. You have found that ever since following Vaughn Strabane these procedures religiously, your sleep is deep and untroubled, and not unlike a coma. Thus, when the corncrake alight upon your head, and exit talons into the thick wall of your sleep helmet to steady itself in its purging, you do not feel a thing. You remain fast asleep, content and snug in lala land.

From its perch, the corncrake surveys its surroundings, if you asked it, why it had flown in through the window, and if it was somehow capable of responding and an approximation of human speech so that you understood it to reply, it's likely that the corncrake would have absolutely no idea what impelled it. Who knows why birds do what they do. Not even the birds themselves know, for their brains are tiny. Rather than using reason, birds follow the dictates of instinct. What you will arrive would call gut feelings, or we're able to say is that on this occasion, the corncrake saw the open window and took the opportunity to fly into your bedroom, probably in the hope of finding something to eat. Fortunately, densely woven wall does not feature as part of a corncrakes regular diet. So while the bird rests from the exertions of its flight, perched on your head, it trains its two black fathomless savage and human eyes upon your bedroom. It takes in the frieze of martyred saints above the dado rail, the wainscot, the wardrobe, the chest of drawers, the rug, and the unseemly stains. It takes in the clutter atop the bedside cabinet, the glass of water, the folded spectacles, the scrunched tissue, the anglepoise lamp, the stray button, the biral, the pins, the bowl, the dust, the cardboard, carton of pills, the alarm clock, the other button, the little jars, that little bottles, the nameless thing of me, the biscuit crumbs, the snuffbox, the coinage, the pipe cleaners, the mud idol, the cotton wall, the toffee, Apple wrapper, the handkerchief, the string, the puppet, the potty, the Duster, the rag, the bus ticket, the scrap of paper, the pocket Bible, the rosary beads, the taffy tin, the bombbomb, the monkey snapshot in its frame, the atomizer the shopping list, the rubber band, the drawing pin, the plaster Madonna and Child statuette, the sophisticated cocktail party invitation, the chewing gum, the gloves, the telephone, Whereas a magpie or a jack door, rather than a corncrake, it might swoop and snatch up in its beak one of the smaller items on the top of the cabinet and fly out through the window and a way to deposit to the stolen Google in its nest. In folktales, and legends, magpies and jackdaws often appear as thieves, the bird equivalent of opportunistic pickpockets. And this characterization has some basis in brute AV and the fact not so the corncrake which is not thought of as a pillaging bird. So while it gazes upon the clutter, it remains still perched upon your sleeping head and swoops not to snatch booty and its beak. Still on. It will be hard to imagine a night more still more silent than this one. The von Strabane z method ensures you make no stentorian snoring noise, the sound of your breathing is almost imperceptible muffled by the sleep helmet. The corncrakes breathing is equally quiet. Nothing stirs in your bedroom, and from outside through the open window. There is not even a breath of wind is as if the planet has fallen asleep with you. I have said that we can have no idea what prompts a bird to do what it does. So I can offer no logical reason explanation for the sudden loud, jarring, raucous cry of the corncrake on your head. It makes it hard core twice, then lifts off and flies away out of the window. The effect on you is instantaneous and awful. You waken alarmed indeed, panic stricken as a product with a burning hot pointy stick. You do not see the corncrake fly away. So you cannot account for the horror by which you are convulsed trembling you clamber out of bed and shuffle to your toilet to pedal or pedal occasioned by fear, such as the raucous and alarming call of the corncrake.

We're going to have one more chapter from the Mr. Keys book of birds or Mr. Keys bumper book of birds. Because I've only written four chapters of it so far. But you know, that's for four chapters in five days. That's not bad going. But before I do that, as it strikes me that it's quite a long time or a few weeks anyway, since I've recommended that one thing that you could do is donate to hooting yard. And one of the best reasons for doing so well baby if I read this letter comes from Tim thurn, a reader and listener. Tim says, Dear Mr. Key 10 minutes ago, I pressed the make a donation button on your website, hooting yard.org which took me to paypal where I deposited some money just for you. And ever since I did that, I felt this incredible boom glow in the cockles of my heart. I feel absolutely blissful, as if in some kind of mystic Nirvana state. And I realized that this is entirely because I have sent money to you. I recommend that everyone else do likewise. You're passionately Tim third. Well, that's very kind of Tim. And I'm sure he's right. I'm sure that sending me money is probably a very quick shortcut to feeling absolutely fantastic about yourself. And who doesn't want to feel that chapter for the CIF trap. The trip trap is a type of bird. It could be said to be a difficult little bird for reasons which I shall explain. The chief calf is almost exactly the same type of bird as the willow warbler. And the difficulty arises because I've already written about A Willow warbler. I'm not trying to claim that these two birds are identical in all particulars, as that would be foolish, but quite honestly, they're so alike that only the most acutely observant among you would be able to tell the difference. It would not surprise me to learn that even a Christian might mistake a willow warbler for a cliff trap and vice versa. So what hope can there be for us humans? Some might argue that birds organs of perception act in ways wholly alien to us, and that their apprehension of the world around them is as a consequence, so vastly different to ours. That a cliff travel always recognize the chief toughness of another chief Jeff, and the willow warbler Enos of a willow warbler, it would be fruitless to argue the case. All I'm trying to say is that as far as we humans are concerned, there is precious little difference between the two birds. So having devoted a captor to the willow warbler, I do know I do not want to risk repeating myself by contouring on a bat the chief trap. Christ knows the repetitions involved in writing about birds and numerous enough beat feathers, wings talents, you're already more than familiar with them. And we haven't yet started to consider such things as slashed and savaged semi digested field mice and voles and other gruesome dishes from the birdie recipe book. Yet, while some repetitiveness is unavoidable in a work such as this, if the reader is to gain a clear understanding of all the different birds, I do not want to type out the same old baloney over and over again, things would be much easier if similar, or in some cases, identical types of birds had not been given several different names. Don't get me started on the green plover, for example. But we must deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be in our wildest dreams. This Earthbound realism is particularly and paradoxically necessary in the case of bird, which in the main tend not to be Earthbound at all. One of the first things the amateur will notice about birds is that God has granted them the power of flight. There are of course exceptions, such as the ostrich, a huge and very stupid bird,

which is tethered by gravity to the earth as decisively as you and me. But the cliff Jeff, like the majority of birds can fly. Anything else that might usefully be said about the chit chat I have already covered in the chapter on the willow warbler, you can trust me on this. It goes without saying that I know more about birds than you do. After all, I'm the writer and you whoever you are of the reader, or listener, and it seems plain as the peas on my fork that if you already knew much about birds, you would not feel the need to read this book or listen to this program. You'd be out tramping the countryside, a pair of binoculars dangling around your neck pointing at our feathered friends and showing off by exclaiming to your companion. Oh look Constance, a cliff calf, suspecting that poor constant thought she was peering at a willow warbler.

And that's the end of this week's show the almost 10th Anniversary Show. The next episode will be post 10th anniversary so it'll be the 11th year or something. Anyway, so that's that's putting out on the air for this week for tractors from Mr. Keyes bumper book of bird publication date, completely unknown, because no one yet wants to publish it. Bye bye
