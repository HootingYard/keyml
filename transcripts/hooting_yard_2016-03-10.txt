Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM on resonance fm.com depending on how you're listening, my name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air live from London. I found myself a loose end. So I signed up for pill beans crash course in the imitation of Christ. Earlier in the day, plodding through the streets, I'd been given a leaflet. The Hawker who handed it to me was a person of regrettable grumpiness, and some of his filth inevitably besmirch the leaflet, which was smudged with the effect that I misread the imitation of Christ as the imitation of Chris. Chris, who I wondered, hoping that Pilbeam was taking an overfamiliar tone with regard to the act of Christopher Plummer. It so happened that I was wearing a Tyrolean jacket, not unlike the one sported by plumber in his career defining role as Captain von Trapp in the film version of the sound of music. dressed so I felt I would have an excellent chance of crashing through the crash course. And perhaps winning applauded or to last, a falling raindrop washed away the smudge, and I realized the course was about Christ rather than Christopher Plummer. Still, I was, as I said, a loose end. So I headed for the hall where the course was to be held, and I signed up. throng and hubbub packed the hall, but I found an empty seat and sat down. Soon an alpha fellow is assumed to be Pilbeam appeared on a dais at the front. The first thing he said was, I am not Pilbeam. Had I been neutered here under false pretenses. The speaker cut up pale and widdershins figure and was almost as grime splattered as the Hawker in the street. It may even have been the same man, no doubt or rascal, but I have nothing better to do. So I continued to sit and listen. I am sorry to say that Pilbeam is not able to be with us today. He has been incapacitated by Mikkel European pig flu, and has asked me to deputize for him. While I would never make so bold as to compare myself to pill beam, Please be assured that you are in good hands. I have spent many years studying under Pilbeam eating from the same table, having my hair cut at the same barbers with the same pair of scissors and wearing the same size shoes, like Beckett and Joyce. My name is Lars rather than Pilbeam. But I can say truthfully, that I am the next best thing to pill beam, when it comes to delivering this crash course. So, let us turn now to the crack course itself, the aim of which is to furnish you with the skills necessary to imitate Christ. As this is a crash course. We will not be seeking to emulate Christ in every particular. If we tried that He chuckled, we would become so Christ like there would be a risk of blasphemy. Far better, according to Pilbeam, this precept, to imitate Christ in a limited way, enough for us to benefit and to become holier than we are, but not so much that we threaten the unique and ineffable goodness of Christ our Lord Himself. I trust you're all keeping up. Excellent. In what way Then shall we imitate Christ? You will all I hope to be familiar with the story of the Gadarene swine. It is to be found in all three of the Synoptic Gospels in Matthew 828, to 32. In Mark five one to 13 and in Luke 826 to 33. Briefly put, a poor man possessed by demons, begs Christ to release him from his torment. Christ, Julie casts the demons out of the man and into some nearby pigs, which vary upon goats. rushing headlong into the sea and drown. certain details differ in the three accounts. But that's the general idea.

Frank Key  05:11
Now, Pilbeam states that we can imitate Christ by driving a herd of pigs into the sea, or indeed into any large body of water. We need not worry our little heads about finding a man possessed by demons and all that hullabaloo. For our purposes, we take a crash course shortcut by imagining we have cast the demons out of the man and into the pigs. And we simply go the pigs into the water and make damn sure none of them manages to make it back to shore. The important thing in imitating Christ accurately is to drown the pigs. Any questions? I put up my hand. In your opening remarks I piped up and pointed at you said that Pilbeam could not be with us because he's suffering from middle European pig flu. Could it be that this whole Crash Course is his way of exacting vicarious revenge? upon the flu ridden pigs he blamed for his condition? There were several gasps from the audience. Last paused menacingly before responding. Seldom he roared eventually, seldom have I heard so vile a calumny. Oh, vile, vile, the calumny you have committed upon poor saintly bedridden middle European pig flu ridden Pilbeam but Paragon among Crash Course tutors in the imitation of Christ. How dare you, sir? How dare you? I'm sorry, I said. It was just a passing thought that was all laws, sin mollified, if only slightly. There is a fourth apocryphal version of the story of the gathering swine, he said in the Gospel According to Pilbeam, 640 to 251. Here after driving the pigs into the sea, Christ has his henchmen sorry, apostles, attack the man from whom demons have been cast out, beating him insensible with spades and shovels, before injecting his bruised and battered body with a virulent strain of medieval European pig Flo, and then abandoning him on a remote at all Far, far out at sea. Usually, we do not attempt to enact the Pilbeam version on this crash course for want of a volunteer, but on this occasion, we shall take great pleasure in doing so. And last clapped his hands and summon His apostles sorry henchmen. And they dragged me out of the hole and off towards the coastal pig farm, and the vast, wet, unforgiving sea.

Yes, I'd like to read now from a different extract from the apocryphal gospel of Pilbeam. And this actually, coincidentally has a sort of time genteel, tangential connection to Sir George Martin. Now at that time, there dwelt in gas and moptop, whose name was ringgo. And one day, the Lord appeared to Ringo and he was sort of frightened ringgo target at the fringe of his mop top, so it might cover his eyes, that he could hide the Lord from his sight. Be not a feared mop top boom the Lord for the Lord always bake in a boom when he appeared in gaff. And Ringo, who carried a stick in each hand with Richie thumped animal hide had dropped his sticks When tugging at his hair, pick up vise sticks commanded the Lord and Ringo did so what does that want with me Lord, wild ringgo he was an hairy moptop with many rings on his fingers and an innate sense of rhythm. Thou shalt hide the hens to piss Gar, boom, good lord, and thou shalt climb to the top of the mountain, and thou shalt thump vie stick there, upon the hides of bison and the salamander stretched upon a frame and thump them to upon disks of metal and make a den. And the Lord made mysterious maneuvers with his hands, and blessed ringgo mop top, and then he vanished in a cloud of vapor isness and all was still and Ringo was alone in Gath. And gringo bit, took himself with great haste to the main railway Terminus in GAF, where he might catch a train to take him all the way to pescar. Now at the railway Terminus, there was an SAT crap of exceeding girth, and ringgo spake unto him saying, I am sent to piss God by the Lord, but I know not how I might journey thence from here. And the satrap LED ring go to a tank engine, and commanded him in a voice of great pump to step aboard. The engine was blue, the blue of heaven. And with chugs and wheezes the Tank Engine, with the mop top aboard, set off along the branch line to pace Gar.

bartlow. Unbeknownst to Ringo, the satrap of exceeding girth had so arranged things that the engine was shunted into sidings halfway between Gath and Piz Gar, and there it sat and would not move. And thus did ringgo the mop top find himself marooned, and far from pisgah and from the mountain top, and his two sticks dangled from his bear ring fingers with not to thump and Ringo wept.

There will be no further episodes of this shabby soap opera. There was a damning review in the slop bucket. incoherent gibberish from first to last. And it is swept away and gone.

I've noted the elsebeth a character in the soap opera those these plastic betrayals was undone by foxglove and foxgloves and This prompted a letter from Dr. Ruth pastry. did mine here key she writes, presuming me to be a document for reasons best known to yourself. I could not help noticing that in the latest episode of these plastic betrayals. elsebeth is undone by foxgloves. Now, I yield to no one in the sheer intensity of my admiration for your shore grasp of just about everything in the known universe, with the obvious exception of Ornithology, of which you are quite dramatically ignorant. But I must confess I read these words when I read these words. I spat out my lukewarm vitamin enhanced milk and Lucozade pepper drink all over the tablecloth embroidered as it so happens with the design of foxgloves by the noted tablecloth designer dot foxglove cloth. certain other details in the episode, such as vinegar dusks and Stan Nightingale's plummeting from rooftops have the unmistakable stamp of verisimilitude of actual phenomena in an actual world actually occurring but to be undone by foxgloves Come, come mine hair, Kate, this strikes me and I'm sure many others as a fancy born of an overheated brain. I think you would be well advised to go and lie down in a darkened room with a cold compress upon your forehead, and perhaps a cassette recording of sounds designed to encourage relaxation, such as the songs of whales, the breeze rustling through a clump of Aspen's or Alistair Crowley invoking the great god Pan. Yours more in sorrow than in actuality Dr. Ruth pastry Well, it's always a pleasure to hear from Dr. pastry, and I usually reread her letter several times before adding them to the bundle tied with pink ribbon, which I keep in a cardboard box underneath my sink. On this occasion, however, I tossed the letter aside after a single reading, and I minded to set fire to it later, after I have set out on my very own quest for fire babbling in an artificial primitive language devised by the late Mancunian polymath Anthony Burgess. Dr. pastry Well, I hope Forgive me for asserting that she has no idea what she's talking about. Whereas I, as always do. Unlike Dr. pastry, I have scoured the literature and found innumerable innumerable instances, particularly in soap operas of characters being undone by foxgloves unhinged by petunias and unmanned by primroses. I cannot actually provide any concrete examples here. And now, obviously, because I have far better things to do with my time, such as going on a quest for fire, and eating my breakfast, and gazing disconsolately out of the window, the crows on the lawn in the rain. And it may well be that I have not really scoured the literature, and not really found any examples of floral undoing or unhinged, or on Manning, whatever that latter might mean. And my claims have done so is but the product of an overheated brain. But let us not forget that in the country of the swiss roll, the roll is Swiss. Now, if somebody will hand me a megaphone, I will shot my head off from a vantage point on a promontory looking out over the vast, wet, hilarious sea. And I feel frightened the fish and the dolphins and the plankton and the krill, and I shall wake the krakken

here's an old favorite. Listen tiny ones. If you're good, I'll take you on an outing. I will take you to the old balsa wood factory on the edge of the Big Blue Lake. Every Thursday afternoon at two o'clock, there is a tour of the factory especially for tiny tots. The Hooters sound and everyone lines up at a kiosk in the carpark and Mr. verdigris appears in his towering hat with bells on his sleeves and ribbons and bunting and hamsters nestling in his pocket. And he takes the lucky people, the ones with ticket on a tour of the factory. I was sent some tickets in the post yesterday as a special treat. I know that 10 the radio meteorologist says that Thursday will be a day of driving rain and howling gales and I know that it will be the fourth day of our fast and we will be famished, but I'm determined that we go. The alternative is that we spent yet another afternoon trying to tether the wild goat and I'm not sure I can take much more of that. So the balsa wood factory it will be first there was the grass verge of the car park and then alone. Some derelict outbuildings including a shed wearing rotted the remains of the hanger janitor and then the factory itself. Its cavernous interior lit by thousands of gas jets and eerily silent safer the occasional buzzing of a sort of the distant insistent pounding of a pulper from the annex over beyond the railway tracks, a sound born in on the wind. After that, up the metal Stairway to the offices always deserted on Thursday afternoons, even tiny little shoes making the floorboards creak and shelves upon shelves stacked with Higgledy Piggledy piles of files and papers and dockets. And Mr. verdigris took the hamsters from his pocket and place them on a bed of straw next to an important looking desk. Its surface, polished to subject dream as left the children dumbfounded and resting on it, nothing but a fat new fountain pen and the Biggest bottle of ink you could imagine, and the pen had never been used, and the bottle never opened. For the lids of both were jammed by dint of mischievous sprites that scampered in the rafters overhead. And it was up to the rafters now, up to the attic, past boxes and crates filled with rusty and inexplicable machines, redundant cash registers, and forgotten magnetic recording devices through a narrow corridor littered with broken brooms and hosts to a mysterious gurgling noise until we reached the chamber at the end of our tour guide, with in his towering hat, kicked open the door so violently, and we entered a room lit in a blue blue glow, like the blue of heaven. And there in the corner, sprawled on a divan whistle Pinocchio dexterously plucking flies out of the blue air with his tiny wooden fingers, and biting the tiny head of each tiny fly with his tiny wooden teeth.

So that's the end of this week's show. I'll leave you with a couple of extracts from the non best selling book, Mr. K, shorter, potted brief, brief lives available from all good bookshops. Yes, still available. So go and buy a copy if you haven't got one already. And I'll read you a couple of couple of bits from that. For example, Joe Simpson, English mountain airborne 1960. Simpsons book Touching the Void has become a modern classic and is now taught as a set text in some schools. This has led to the author engaging with his young readers on Twitter. One use they're dismissed Simpson with the matchless phrase cravat wangka, which I do think is superb. And dodi Smith Dodie Smith, English writer 1896 to 1990. The author of 101 Dalmatians, and I capture the castle had fond memories of Auntie Bertha. And I quote, she could not tell her right hand from her left unless she hopped, and he insisted that if he was left alone, for more than three hours, her teeth went soft. Auntie Bertha always added the word burn this at the end of every letter she wrote. And, yes, there you go. Dodie Smith, and then Joe Simpson, and this was hooting yard on the air coming up to our 12th anniversary in a few weeks time. And it's rather an alarming thought. If I make it that far. I'll see you next week. Bye bye.
