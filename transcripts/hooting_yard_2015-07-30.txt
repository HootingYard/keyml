Hello pickers, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. Did you know that babinski the infamous walrus mustache serial killer, had an idiot half brother. This trap, who for the sake of convenience, we shall call babinski to was officially classified as a type four Cretan under the official idiot classification system, obtaining at that time in that land under that regime. I'm afraid I don't know how many numbered types of credit in the world, nor of the nature a number of other idiot types. And I've only been able to ascertain babinski two's official classification. After years and years of fossicking about in Moly archives, grave peril to my physical and mental health. That is why I walk with a stick and hold what I delude myself are coherent conversations with birds, including linnets and partridges as a type for Cretan babinski to was considered to be a peculiarly high functioning idiot, deemed suitable for such tasks as using a pointy stick to gather lit litter from verdant Parkland, mopping up filth in long curry doors, sitting in a tent outside a cathedral and writing opinion pieces for The Guardian. Unfortunately, Judah fuddled bureaucracy, several doctors had instead recommended that the most effective treatment for him that time in that land under that regime was to be trained up in a cellar and fed very occasionally on slops, or, if that option was not available, to be trained up in an attic, and fed very occasionally on pap. Such then was his plight in the dying days of the corrupt and despicable reign of the double kings and Berto and ignatz. babinski himself, walrus mustache and lumbering and psychotic, knew nothing of his idiot half brothers fight. They had been parted since they were tiny. If one can for a moment, imagine a tiny babinski. Yet, like us all, the blood drenched nutcase was once an innocent baby in arms, rocked in a cradle and sang to buy his mama, though, perhaps will not examine too closely. The words of the song is that good woman sang, nor indeed their tunes, if croons they can be called, for it is probable that it was those very songs or hideous category called, that laid the egg of crime within his brain. She did not sing the babinski to their power thing happened unexpectedly during a family picnic at a site of bucolic glory. When babinski was three and bubinski. Two was two. There was a sudden thunderstorm, my mom was struck by lightning, a wolf Carrie babinski. off into the woods. His idiot half brother was left behind, drooling on the picnic blanket, deafened by jet fighters swooping low overhead, and by thunder, until he was gathered up and swaddled in the picnic blanket, and born away by our passing a widow woman. Older Mother seabag, Monte fury had been reduced to penury since the death of her husband in one of King Alberto's insane wars, or possibly in one of King eggs. Max's same ones, and and she conceived the idea of selling the child at that time in that land under that regime by had a primitive version of eBay. So she took a snapshot of the idiot taught and posted it and waited for bids to come in.

Frank Key  05:24
All we know now is that at least one bid must have been made for bubinski to was indeed sold, to whom and for what some we know not, and all trace of him is lost until he turns up some 30 or 40, or God help us 50 years later, chained up in a cellar or an attic by dint of bureaucratic Fazal. At which point his criminal half brother babinski enters the same. The double kingdom is on its last legs. Um, Berto is spending more and more of his time, like burloak Spinoza pitting spiders against each other in combat. ignatz has taken the obsessive annotation of back numbers of the Reader's Digest. Every day, entire flocks of birds are dropping dead out of the sky. And wherever one looks, the potatoes are blighted, the land is descending into a state of anarchy, an ideal playground for a villain like bubinski. No doubt on that fateful March morning, cavorting with wolves in the woods. He was plotting further and ever more heinous enormities. But then word reached him via the primitive version of spam email prevalent at that time in that land under that crumbling regime. That is idiot half brother babinski. To was languishing chained up in a cellar or an attic, and fed very occasionally on swaps or pap at all because of a puzzlement regarding precisely which classification of Cretan type he fell into. It is important for the listener to understand that for all his derangement, and demented pneus and bloodlust and psychopathology, and the echoes of those mad, horrible maternal songs ricocheting forever inside his skull bubinski was filled with a boundless fraternal devotion to Dubinsky to how often he had vowed, if once he could find his last half brother, to clasp into his bosom and slobber over him, and teach him all the tricks of strangulation and slicing up and bone smashing, and other such murderous techniques as he had mastered. Oh, he had vowed as much at least three or four times during the long insanitary decades. I'm bertos and ignatz his kingship so now on this windy March morning, a prize that last of his idiot half brothers plight bubinski preened his walrus mustache, and set off for the grim bleak vile border outpost where babinski to was confined on the way he killed and killed and killed again. close to the border. He stopped by a post office to ask for directions. And while he was there, he bought some postage stamps. Well, excuse me. Well, to be more accurate, they did not sound like buy them or steal them, having first snap respond of the postmaster and chopped him up with an axe. Having wiped his hands clean on one of his many rags. bubinski was disconcerted to note that the heads of both the heads of both ambato and ignatz had been scratched out on the postage stamps, and in their place was a hasty potato print of quite a different head, a head, which bore a distinct resemblance to bubinski himself. What can this mean? He shouted in vain the bloody body parts strewn across the post office floor. What it meant was the only the day before the regime had finally collapsed. Umberto and ignatz had been helicoptered into exile on a faraway sea good at all. The revolutionary council had free babinski to from these trains and the seller or his attic and installed Him as their puppet leader. From that day on for untold years, by being ski too. demand, idiotically trained up sprawled on innumerable soft plush cushions in the presidential palace and fed copious Lee upon fruit and fiber breakfast cereal and smokers Pop Tarts, and Pharaoh globin vitamin supplement.

bubinski himself was never granted an audience with the puppet potentate, but he had other fish to fry and bones to break and throat to slit and gore to spill.

I often have coughing fits during the show and you'll be used to those but just then. In that little break, all the music could play. I had a sneezing fit, so don't be surprised if there are some small further sneezes to come. We will know that sneezes like to multiply, like coat hangers. The best thing to do in certain circumstances is to lie on your side upon the grass in a meadow, and have an acolyte pour vinegar into your ear through a funnel. When you stand up in the middle of the meadow, and tilt your head shaking a little, the vinegar will be expelled from your ear and you will feel the benefits. It is important that you have an acolyte who can properly judge the amount of vinegar to pour into your ear. too little of the whole exercise is pointless. Too much and you will be tilting your head and faking it until the cows come home and you will find it very difficult to expel all the vinegar. When the cows come home, they might be disconcerted to find you in their Meadow with your tilted head and some of them may become fractious. fractures, cows can be dangerous. So it will help if you have your acolyte armed with some sort of cow protection device. This might be made of corrugated cardboard, or alternative leave tin foil. best to consult a catalog of cow protection devices beforehand with your afterlight your side. Choosing an acolyte to whom you're prepared to entrust the pouring and the cow protection is a fraud business. But believe you made a process during which you can expect much heightened emotion, many tears and a certain amount of wailing and now and then fencing contest contest with flashing at pays. It has even been known for rival acolytes to bash each other about with spade, so it's advisable not to give them access to the keys to the potting shed. You will probably have at least one set of duplicate potting shed keys hanging from a hook in the pantry to make sure you keep the pantry out of bounds to your acolytes safe for those who need it to enter it to fetch tins of tinned plums and tinned radishes and other tinned goods. It's a simple matter to give, but one acolyte, the responsibility for the fetching of tins. And that acolyte can be disqualified from even the possibility of pouring vinegar into your ear in the middle of the cow Meadow while you lie on your side by having him blinded or having his legs broken and confining him to the house. Another thing to bear in mind when choosing an appropriate acolyte is that they must be able to get you from the house in the middle of the meadow with the minimum of fast, fastest corrosive of the soul and has been known to result in horrible bodily eruptions, such as sores and boils and sappy writing patches of pass in such tender places as the growing in the armpits. You will want a level headed and charming acolyte, one who confronted by menacing geese on the way from the house to the meadow will suit them by singing something by Kevin Coyne and a deeply lovely voice. DC usually located in this way, even the most ferocious ones, you will probably want to be carried from the house to the meadow on a Pam and Quinn. Given your preening self regard, you will thus require an additional acolyte or two to do the carrying one of whom can also be the vinegar pouring acolyte if you so wish. It's therefore a very good idea to have some distractions at hand to entertain those who, once their carrying is done, have not to do until you command them to carry you back to the house when you flush the vinegar out of your ear.

Most acolytes can be happy by boardgames, poopy the Kronstadt rebellion, and waiting around in a meadow while vinegar is poured into the air of your hero are splendid and complicated games using dice counters, and the feathers of placated geese. But of course, there are many other games board based and otherwise, which you may consider packing in your Pipi bag, when making preparations to be carried from the house to the meadow. If you have acolytes who are resistant to the allure of exciting board games, it's probably best to dismiss them with their tails between their legs. As the saying goes. The dismissal of acolytes can be problematic, particularly if they're clinging, clinging acolytes are known to use gum to fix themselves to fixtures and fittings, such as the doors of pantries and the railings bordering manses. beyond your guard against them. rifle fire tends to deter all but the cleanest, who may have to be detached from their gummy emplacement with gum dissolving fluids in spray canisters. When making purchase of these canisters, you may be asked to fill out a form declaring that they will be not be used to dissolve the gum of fixing an acolyte to the ravings of your man's in these circumstances, just lie you will go to hell. But would you rather not be in hell then be subject to the falling of a gum clinging acolyte?

I think spilled soup on a piece of cambric. The verger tried to amend his sloppiness by dabbing at the cambric with a damp sponge. Alas, so much chemical colorant had been added to the soup, which was of a tomato flavor. And so hastily and violently did the virgin do his dabbing. The bright orange stain was impressed into the cambric. The cambric, by the way, was blue with golden stars, like the vault of heaven. Fearing that he had erratic, complete in besmirched, a representation of the ethereal realm, the verger hid the can brick and the sponge in a cupboard and poured the remainder of his tomato soup down the drain. He cleaned his bowl and spoon with more care than he had dabbed at the camera, and placed them exactly where he had found them among the crockery and cutlery, having first dried them with a tea towel, depicting the martyrdom of St. Anselm. This was an historically inaccurate tea towel, as St. Anselm died a natural death rather than being martyred for his faith. It was not the only erroneous tea towel in the kitchen. The Verge of hope that hiding the evidence of his sloppiness in the cupboard, would prevent it from coming to light. But he reckoned without the involvement of detective Captain kargh pan. The detective was called in by the bishop on an unrelated matter, something to do with the local scene. lightbar who had been taking potshots at the cathedral hens? card pan was noted for his energetic approach to police work. And on this occasion, he strained so many sinews, but by mid morning, he was exhausted and dehydrated. characterised characteristically, he did not whimper to the bishop begging for refreshments, but instead blundered about until he found the kitchen, where he intended to gulp down the water straight from the tap. Having done enough gulping to make himself feel human again, car pan could not resist opening all the drawers and cupboards in the kitchen and examining the contents with his magnifying glass. Such was his method. Although it was unlikely that either the sniper or their hand had ever been in the kitchen, the detective assume nothing. Vast it was that he discovered the hidden cambric and sponge, he was extremely suspicious of the bright orange stain. Under questioning the verger admitted his part, but insisted that the sponge and the camera had no connection to the sniper and the hands. Detective, Captain cargo van roughed him up a bit, breaking one of his arms and dislocating his jaw. This too, was his method. The verger continued to protest his innocence throughout his subsequent trial, and the long years on the prison Hulk mod off and unspeakable stretch of coastline. Long after his death, campaigners sought for him a posthumous pardon. But we now know that card pan was right all along, and that the verge and the sniper were one in the same interviewed for a television documentary during his long and happy retirement. Can't pan explained that for him, it was an open and shut case. A man who can smear tomato soup upon a picture of the vault of heaven. And who makes use of historically erroneous tea towels is precisely the sort of man who would shoot an innocent clucking hen with a man the car car, no snipers rifle. He said, Today, we are unmasked, I will acknowledge the wisdom of those words.

This is the last show before the summer break. And I just thought I'd mentioned that before we come back. Sorry, I've just lost what I was going to read to you next. Before. Around the time we come back in September. Mr. Keys book will be published, at least I think so. As far as I know, it will be. It's called Mr. Keys. Mr. Kay's shorter, potted, brief, brief lives. And it's a collection of about 500. Very, very short, potted biographies, some of which I've read on this show in the past. And so that is apparently being published on the third of September. So I do recommend that you buy it obviously. It should be in all good book shops and available from places like Amazon and online places but you should go to a proper bookshop I think if you if you have run in your vicinity. So anyway, go and buy it. Mr. Key shorter potty, brief, brief lives. On the third of Set, Go queue up to buy it on the third of September. There's bound to be huge queues. But you should be right at the front. And we'll talk about a bit more about that near when I went way back. But to end the show this week. A lot of you will know that I'm a keen listener to farming today with you On a quarter to six in the morning on radio four. And I'm not, of course a farmer myself, but my daily listening habit has made me wonder how I would equip myself. If I happen to fall into conversation with a real farmer. Obviously, I would want to be able to hold my own and to demonstrate a familiarity with rustic ways. To this end, I've recently memorized a list of vintage farm implements and I've been practicing dropping one or two of them casually into my conversations. So if and when I do engage in a chinwag with a bona fide farmer, I will be well prepared. You might want to commit the list to memory to so I'll read it and as I read it, you can make a note of it in Pitman shorthand, and then learn it. A turn some Bendel's, a bean stubble rake golf pincers, according mail to Kentish binding raked a disc colder at a sub soil pulverizer plow, potato grading shovel, five Morris's turnip flycatchers to handcrank threshers, a seed ruski an automatic sheaf tying mechanism.
