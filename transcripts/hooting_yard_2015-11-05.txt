Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. Again

in conga, you can recognize the satraps because they were plume Pat, also untold in guma. By contrast, the hats of the satraps are unclaimed and look like any other hat spotted by a million other Guzman's. The satraps can be distinguished by their tattoos. pangan satraps estroux tattooing, which was which is reserved for their shaman, but there are no shaman in guma. If one flies over the mountains into Gar, one finds that the satraps wear plumed hat and sport tattoos, and that the Crieff method of adverting to their satrap done is their habit of always carrying a bundle of carry sticks. The shaman of Gar have both plumed hats and tattoos, but they do not carry tally sticks, like tie their hair in complex stylized not. This much I have learned and then grateful to have learned from a fascinating periodical entitled satraps and shaman of panga and guma, and Gar. It is published on the first Thursday of each month, and it's packed with articles and photographs and quizzes and competitions. Since I picked up a copy at a newsagent in an Esplanade on a mezzanine level at an airport a short while ago. It's become my absolute favorite periodical ever, even though I had no previous interest in either satraps, or shaman, whether they were from panga or goomer, or Gar, or any other country you care to mention. I have been won over by the magazine's excellence in all particulars, but mostly by its vividness. It is the most vivid of periodicals more vivid even than the Reader's Digest. In panga the satraps hold councils which they all decide which are discussed important meteorological issues. The pangan shaman consider the weather to fall within their purview, and this can lead to clashes between satraps and shaman. Such clashes are conducted at a strictly verbal level, and give rise to some fascinating linguistic quirks. Because there are no shaman in guma the guman satraps have the weather alter themselves and face no clashes. In Gar, the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knot. I have said that God is on the other side of the mountains from panga and guma. But I have yet to learn what these mountains are cold, or indeed where they are. vivid is the periodical is I have to say that it is unforthcoming on massive geographical. And that's an understatement. I've been toying with the idea of writing a letter to the editor suggesting that a future issue might include some maps. When I was a little chap, I had a passion for maps, just like the narrator of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I am no longer a little trap at all. But I would like to see maps, colorful ones of panga and guma and God they would make the period periodical even more vivid than it already is. In panga the satraps have dominion over the birds of the air, or at least they act as if they do. They devise many laws to which the birds of the air are subject. flightless birds fall within the remit of the shaman of panga. They do not create laws, but they consider flightless birds to be sacred and count them often. The satraps count the birds of the air also with a different purpose in mind. In guma, all known birds are poultry in Gaza, the satraps carry tally sticks, and the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots. I stumbled upon my first copy of the periodical in that newsagent in an Esplanade on a mezzanine level as an airport quite by accident. I was due to board a flight to a remote Prison Island, where I had been asked to service out the convict brains with an exciting and dangerous new fluid.

I had a few minutes to spare before my flight and went to pick up the latest copy of the Reader's Digest. repair work was being done to the newsagents frontage, so I had to squeeze in through the side panel, thus entering a part of the shop I would normally not have explored. Most of the racks here were stacked with fruit pastels and pastry snacks. And I have no need of these things. For when traveling I always bring my own food a single copy of the September issue of satraps and shaman of Congo and guma and Gar lay a top a tinderbox on the floor next to the display of packets of Jammie teardrops. I picked it up out of curiosity, and was struck by it vividness in panga the satraps have a counting system of astonishing complexity. It is possible that their brains are wired in a way unique to them. The shaman count as you are I would count, although as you would expect, they use different words for numbers. The satraps do not even use words when they count, nor do the SAT traps in guma but that is because they do not count at all. The guman SAP traps pipe and hum in places counting. they manufacture spikes and nails and do a lot of purposeless hammering. In Gar the satraps carry tally sticks.

Frank Key  07:17
The publishers do not make a binder available in which to keep copies of their visit periodical. And this is another matter I plan to raise in my letter to the editor recommending the inclusion of colorful maps. I'm extremely keen on binders for periodicals, whether or not they're vivid. It is true that I have quite a number of loose unbound periodicals in my collection. And that pains me I numb the pain with prayer for that is what the Bishop of Southern told me to do. When some of the more promising convicts had had their brains released with my exciting and dangerous new fluid, I sent them a project to make binders for my unbound periodicals including satraps and shaman of panga and guma, and Gar, they made an excellent Fist of it with limited resources. And I like to think that the servicing had much to do with that. impairment panga. The satraps make regular changes to the plumes in their hats according to the phases of the moon. The shaman take no notice of the moon, for they owe fealty to the sun in guma the satraps believe that the health of their poultry is dependent upon the stars. In Gar, the satraps carry tally sticks, and the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots. I have counted all my binders, and I'm carrying a tally stick. And later today, after I've watched the news bulletin and weather forecast on television, and had a little chat with the Bishop of Southern I'm going to tie my hair in complex stylized not.

During that little musical interlude, the phone in the studio rang several times. And callers were all asking the same question. Why what is going on about the Bishop of Suffolk in that last piece? Well, that piece was written about eight years ago. And at the time, the Bishop of Suffolk was Tom Butler. I don't think he's still the Bishop of Southern. And Tom Butler appears as one of the shorter, potted, brief brief lives in my book of the same title, which is available from all good book shops, and I urge you to buy it. Anyway, here is the entry for Tom Butler. And I just remind you that everything in shorter, potted brief brief lives is true, or at least attested to be true, all from reliable sources. Tom batla, English Bishop born 1940. In December 2006, Paul and Nicola Sumpter, were sitting in a bar near Southern Cathedral, when they heard their car alarm go off. Rushing outside, they found a gray haired man in the back seat of the car, throwing the toys of their infant son out of the window. When challenged, the man said, on the Bishop of Suffolk, it's what I do. He then got out of the car and disappeared into the night, leaving behind a bag containing among other things, is crucifix.

Frank Key  12:02
Isn't that magnificent? I'm the Bishop of Suffolk. It's what I do. There might be more from shorter, potted brief brief lives before the end of the show, if we have time. But meanwhile, let us imagine that you install a tap on the side of a vat. You will then be able to transfer the contents of the VAT bit by bit into a pail. A pail which you can then log panting and perspiring for many, many miles over the field. What better way to spend a Tuesday afternoon as winter approaches.

Frank Key  13:03
Before the break, we looked at the practice of lugging a pail for many, many miles of the field, I ought to have said, out of the fields and hills, lugging a pile up and down hills is of course more strenuous than marking it over comparatively flat field, but one should not shy away from such exertion. It is character building, if exhausting. The hills were not the only thing I failed to mention. I didn't say with what the pail was filled. Although I was careful to note that it was filled via a tap from a VAT, implying that the contents of the pail was liquid in form. I also neglected to say anything whatsoever about where the pail was being loved to across those fields. And as of now, hills. Obviously, we use a lager of the pale, you would want to know where you would going and to be able to identify your destination, so that you knew you had reached it when you reached it. My failure to mention these significant matters is in some ways akin to a piece of prose that begins and proceed without any clear idea of it to eventual ending. The danger there is that the passage of prose might just peter out fruitlessly and pointlessly that's frustrating the reader or listener and laying the writer open to charges of rigmarole and folly role. Some writers would not bat an eyelid to be some accused, but some word and they might even weep or quake or weep and quake. If you've ever seen a weeping and quaking writer. You will know what I All for spectacle it present. One you will want to banish from your mind as quickly as possible. We may not bother our little heads about the frustrated reader or listener. However, because there are too many readers and listeners become frustrated all the time by all sorts of infelicities and annoyances and crimes committed by writers. But the frustrated listener, or reader is always in a position to toss aside contemptuous or the frustrating reading matter, or to turn off their radio and to read something else, or not to read anything at all, or listen to something else or not listen to anything at all for a while. Let's shed no tears, then, for the reader or listener who can pick and choose among literally millions of things to read or listen to, or probably billions, the lucky pups. In analogy, the reader or listener is lugging a pile of the fields and hills without any clear idea where they're going. Well, quite frankly, who gives a damn where they going, like picked up a pile and then lugging it with always strength, panting and perspiring close to collapse, but pressing on ever on with no end in sight. Because that's how it is in the world of Bella letterer. Pale mugging Dalio

Long, long ago, in February. Regular listeners may recall the resonance fundraising week, which included many excitements really not least of which was an auction. And the hooting yard contribution to the auction was that the highest bidder would have their name immortalized in the title of an out of print pamphlet by Dobson. And yes, that was long ago in February and I'm afraid to say that I've only just got round to writing the piece. However, better late than never, I have written it. And so the winner's name you will hear in the very near future, because I'm going to read the piece to you now. You seem preoccupied Dobson said marigold true to the out of print pamphleteer one morning over breakfast. It was a thunderous day of thunder and thunder craps. And the couple was talking into boiled Soviet and mozzie fan, Allah Mehta. Nick, a dish extolled in a footnote in Dobson's pamphlet, breakfast favorites of the Austrian Empire foreign ministry 1809 to 1821 out of print. Dobson did not reply, for he was preoccupied. The following morning over breakfast marigold crew became so perturbed Dobson's a seeming residence in lala land that she resorted to the Dusty Springfield method to snap him out of it. Named after the 1960s pop strolls hobby, this involves the systematic smashing of crockery by throwing plates and dishes one by one with great indeed hysterical force against the wall. Several smithereens like shattered on the scattered on the floor before Dobson was of a sudden and preoccupied Ah, good morning, my butter cup of unparalleled gorgeousness, said Dobson, through a mouthful of spin shredded hyacinth talks in syrup. You have been terribly preoccupied. Dobson said marigold, true. whatever is going on in that brain of yours. I am inwardly tussling said Dobson with my latest pamphlet, to which I have given the working title, Andy Martin, the tyrannical leader of unit and why he is the most fantastic person in the visible universe. I have no doubt he'll in a tussle will prove as productive ever said marigold to. But may I make one small point, a point which I suggest is germane to your tussle and preoccupation. And what would that be? Oh, daffodil is my dreams said to Dobson. Well, as you and I and your optometrist know only too well Dobson, you are severely myopic. Thus for you, the visible universe does not stretch very far. Indeed, it stops just a few inches away from the front of your head. I do not see Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of unit in the vicinity, and I feel sure I would spot him where he within a few inches of or indeed sitting at my breakfast table. I'm going to go and track pebbles that swans said Dobson, getting up from his chair and putting on his suebi and bus ticket collectors boots, and crashing out of the door into the downpour, which, as on the day before, was accompanied by thunderous thunder and thunder claps. marigold crew had raised a sticky problem about his pamphlet, one he did not wish to discuss, indeed could not discuss. Hence, his sudden departure, leaving his breakfast unfinished. Unfortunately, so sudden was his departure that Dobson neglected to put on his specs. Unable to see more than a few inches ahead, he blundered towards where he thought the duck pond was, I need to take a wrong turn and find himself hopelessly lost in a patch of Bracken and rustic filth.

Frank Key  21:52
He found himself to once more preoccupied, but this time on a totally different subject. Why he wondered, was the duck pond, populated as it was mostly by swans, called the duck pond, rather than the swan pond? It was true that ducks were occasionally to be found dabbling upon it. But any such ducks tended to scarper pretty quickly, when ganged up on by the savage and violent, yet included ugly, elegant swans. I wonder said Dobson himself allowed in the midst of his own myopia whether I ought to abandon the Andy Martin tyrannical leader of unit business for the time being, and instead turn my propelling pencil to the question of duck pond nomenclature. And there was then a terrifically thunderous, and thundery thunderclap, which Dobson chose to interpret as the gods replying to his question in the affirmative. Turning in the direction he thought would take him home, he wrapped his Stalinist scarf, tighter around his neck and squelch through the muck. But alas, the pamphlet his sense of direction, was as pitiful as his eyesight, and several weeks passed before he found his way home, by which time it completely forgotten about duck ponds and Swan pond. What is the subject of the pamphlet you're working on? asked marigold coo over breakfast on the morning after Dobson's return. It is called fortune telling by interpreting the patterns created by crockery smithereens smashed according to the Dusty Springfield method, said Dobson. And I expect to be able to dot the final eye and cross the final tee this very afternoon. And he did, though the pamphlet itself is currently out of print.

It's been suggested to me that I should write my autobiography. Something I've never set my mind to before. But I thought Yes, that is quite a good idea. But rather than going from A to B to C today or doing it systematically I thought I'd jot down memories as they occurred to me. here's, here's one. My childhood hero foofy the clown had a very special talent, he was able to translate the brain of donkeys. That is when foofy overheard the brain of a donkey. He could at the drop of a hat, render it into intelligible humans speak. And sometimes it has to be said into unintelligible human speech. Well, let's be honest, more often than not into unintelligible human speech. In fact, the more I think about it, it casting my mind back across all those shattered years to my childhood. I find it hard to recall a single instance of foofy the clown making anything other than unintelligible blathering whenever he claimed to be translating the brain of donkeys. I'm racking my brains and searching my memory bank with a powerful talk or even a CLI glide, but to no avail. It is possible that I miss remember exactly what foofy the clown was doing when he was burbling and grunting spittle, drooling from his red painted lips with a painted blue. In any case, it may be that he never announced that he was translating the brains of donkeys. I could be mixing him up with a different heroes my childhood, and in all honesty, I do not remember ever seeing foofy in the company of a donkey. I used to think donkeys on the beach at skwala on see another farmyard. Whereas I only ever saw foofy the clown when I was taken to the circus, and I was only taken to the circus once because my mother was allergic to trapeze artists and sawdust. Her skin came out in blockers, and she suffered from debilitating brain spasms. I think then, that it must have been my father home from war in the tropics, who took me to the circus that time. I do remember vividly that he abandoned me there in the vicinity of bears. My father was forgetful rather than malicious. I think he had witnessed things in the tropics that unhinged him. The bears were in a cage, so I was not in immediate peril. It was only when foofy the clown came skittering along garish and motley and grinned at me horribly while rattling a bunch of bear cage keys in my face that I pedaled in my pants from terror. And I ran, I ran and ran away from the circus until I reached the farmyard on the donkeys and the donkeys braid. And I was safe from harm. So that little anecdote tied to a happy ending you'll be pleased with I hope I won't be here next week because I will be in Cornwall, but the probably resonance will plan repeat. So you can wallow in repeated babble. So I'll be back the week after Bye bye.
