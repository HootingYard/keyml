Good evening This is hooting out on the air with me Frank key and it may well be that daily Travis is listened to by heroic Burmese and Nobel Peace Prize winners, but this show is listened to by the next Happy birthday and presumably some other people as well I hope anyway, onwards bashed on the bonds with a sap got by a copper is a fascinating addition to what Sinclair mackell way 1905 to 1980 called the annals of crime and receive gala tea. It is subtitled the collected arrests of detective Captain kargh pan Volume One, which has devoted use of the legendary policeman salivating with pleasure, the prospect of further battering collections. For the time being though even kargh pans greatest fans ought to be sated by this rip roaring record of thousands of arrests. It includes famous cases such as DNS and more the budgerigar trainer, the waited jam jar man and the spectral spectral cardigan knitter of cardigan cheer. Together with a host of the undeservedly obscure and neglected, including the beekeeper Plath and the toast rack poison of box. The detective Captain himself emerges as perhaps a more complex figure than hitherto acknowledged. I was surprised to learn, for example, that on many occasions, he had his sidekicks rough up a culprit before bashing them on the bonds with his SAP. Sometimes he whacked his lead weighted SAP on their bonds and in the kidneys, and it comes as a complete revelation to learn that he sometimes lit his pipe crammed with accurate Serbian pipe tobacco, with one hand while simultaneously sapping a malefactor with the other. Most pipe smokers need one hand to hold the pipe and the other to steady the little Lucifer. It's a measure of karg pans and soucy ons that he was able to deploy his pipe igniting skills with such a plumb in the face of incorrigible villainy. Among the incidental pleasures of the bulk of the glimpses we get of the detective Captain arriving at and leaving the scenes of arrest, a virtuoso description covering 40 pages of the glint in his eye, and the lyrical evocation of the cellar down at the neck, its appurtenances and decor, the scene of so many vivid post arrest wrappings up for in spite of that subtitle, this is not a mere record of card pans arrests alone, were led from arrest to confession in almost every case, whether the miscreant blobs like a baby instantly, or it takes the sidekicks as long as 10 minutes to extract an admission of the squalid criminality in almost every case note because of course now and then one batch from karg pan SAP was all it took to send a Nair do well spinning into the fiery satanic realm of death. If I have one criticism of the book, it's the absence of lurid High Definition color photographs of hapless villains, reaping the grisly desert of their malfeasance. Otherwise, it's a cracking good read in more ways than one.

Cracking good read, I have to say is a collection of essays by Dwight MacDonald, called against the American grain published in 1962. And one of the pieces in the collection is called How to ism and here is a cracking good extract from that essay by Dwight MacDonald. The way to deal with eel worm in flocks is to spray with mythos a parallel tree and curb The way to avoid being slighted by bus drivers, waiters and sales girls is to be unselfish, self confident, thoughtful, enthusiastic and happy. The waiter stopper, long winded speaker is for the chairman to rise thank him for his splendid contribution and lead the audience in thunderous applause. The way to resist a male seducer is for the lady to sit in an armless straight chair and pop a piece of salt water taffy into her mouth every time he is about to kiss her. The way to keep matches dry in a rowboat is to put them in a fruit jar whose lid has been fastened to the underside of the seat to get at them. Unscrew the jar from the lid. The way to hammer circular flounce on a slip cover is too complicated to go into here. The way to make a Stradivarius violin is to do what it tells you to do in you can make a Stradivarius violin or publication of Popular Mechanics press. The way to raise the devil is as follows. Draw a circle with consecrated coal and chalk and write around it. I forbid you Lucifer on the name of the Blessed Trinity to enter this circle. Then take a stand inside the circle and recite I conjure the Lucifer by the ineffable names on alpha yar Ray Sol mess is in godom that now commissioned to do without harming me. You then tell him what to do. And be this works only on Mondays? On Tuesdays. For instance, Lucifer must be addressed as Nam broth on Saturdays as Nat BAM and on Sundays He will answer only to Aqua yell, and will ask for a hair of your head, which will no account should be given to him. He can be fooled with a hair from a fox. The above useful information is a dictaphone from the great American reservoir of know how the our BALCO company publishes how to do it books are selected guide 200 pages of descriptive Bibliography compiled by Robert E. kingery. Mr. kingery has cut a few paths through the jungle of how to ism carving out a mere three and a half thousand titles, which he has arranged under 900 heads from Abacus to yogurt. But traversing even these well blazed trails is fatiguing alcoholics, allergy and alligators, candle making and candy making triggers and children, diving boards and divorce embroidery emotions enameling encyclopedias entertaining and engaging mental illness cheek by jowl with metalwork, money counterfeiting, cozying up to money making ideas, survival, atomic bombs modulating into swans. There are books on how to succeed as a motel operator, a woman, a babysitter, a committee member, a guest, a parent, a child, a lover, a Chevrolet owner, and a baton twirler. The baton twirling made easy.

Three titles, including Donald I Rogers's, teach your wife to be a widow. And get tall Paul O'Neill's Why be short on how to collect books, bottles, buttons and butterflies. on how to buy things, and even one book on how to throw things away, Morgan town's treasures in truck and trash, which tells how to pick out of the treasures from the junk in the cellar and attic, how much they're worth and where to sell them. And which is by no means the only entry in Mr. kingery, three and a half thousand that sound as though it might really be quite useful in dealing with one of the many special problems that bother people in this infrakit age. After all, it is not the fault of the How to author that modern life gets more and more complicated, calling on him to settle problems that are more and more arcane. One sometimes wonders, however, whether a feedback is not at work here, and whether a number of these problems would perhaps never have arisen to bother us if books had not been written telling us how to solve them.

That's a great title, isn't it? Teach your wife to be a widow must get hold of a copy, find out what it what the advice is. And like Spandau Ballet, I bought a ticket to the world. I wish I'd paid more attention at the counter. However, because there was a misprint, I hesitate to say whether it was accidental or deliberate. And what I had actually bought was a ticket to the world. Now, honors match and afficionado have ranges of hills consisting of open country overlying a base of limestone or chalk as the next man. But my ticket did not specify which world I could gain admittance to. I assumed it would be a walled within the Lincolnshire Wolds or the Yorkshire wild or the Cotswolds, but could narrow it down, though further. I suppose I could have gone back to the kiosk where I bought the ticket. But frankly, the person behind the counter frightened the Wits out of me. Without going into details. Just imagine a combination of Rolf Harris, Douglas, Bader and Beelzebub. And you'll have some idea why I hadn't stopped shuttering for a week. For it was indeed, a whole week before I was able to really put my mind to working out which worlds to go to. There were so many distractions. Apart from the shuttering. I had to deal with albinos bloating crises. Six in number like Nexen, dungeon s maths and brand government flotillas, grease hands, item maidens, jigsaw puzzles, kinetic sculptures, lemonade and monkeys, to say nothing of the second half of the alphabet. It was a wonder to me that the issues I had to deal with presented themselves in such an intractable order. I was impatient for W two for June, because I thought I would then be able to investigate the world. But an influx of wax put paid to that fund hope. Eventually, having managed with some panache to tip a zombie off the end of the pier. I took my ticket out of my pocket and gave it a closer look. Surely there must be some indication in the wording regarding the world it was a ticket to But no, I even put it under a microscope when I paid a visit to a lab for other reasons of which you need not be a prized for you know nothing of science, at least not of the science that concern me, which is my own special field buster. After pouring pointlessly over gather tears for hours upon end, it suddenly occurred to me that the wall referred to on my ticket could be not a place but a person. Could it be what I needed to pass through the cemetery gates to visit the tome of Terje world, the Norwegian politician who died in 1972. Or the grave of Herman wold, the Swedish statistician who met his maker 20 years later. It might even be a ticket to grant me an audience with a living world, earning world The American composer or on the same continent, the politician john s. Wald, or back in Scandinavia among the living rather than the dead Susi world, the Danish actress. A trip to the United States or Norway or Sweden or Denmark would cost rather more than going to Lincolnshire or Yorkshire all the costs. So I made an appointment to see my bank manager He's almost as frightening as the man who sold me my ticket, but in a different way, not so much Harrison Bader and Beelzebub has Ringo Starr with indigestion on a sniper's rifle, but needs must when the devil drives. So there I was sitting in the bank waiting to see Mr. Tugend hat, clutching my ticket to the world and the fruitless hope that all would become clear when unexpectedly or became clear. Sitting next to me was he was a pale, spotty teen person, to whom I suspected shampoo was a rare and inexplicable substance. He turned to me and said Wow, you lucky get in it. I overlooked his ungrammatical infelicity and asked where in lay my good fortune. You've got a ticket to the world. He said. I have indeed young with a snapper, I replied with the easy bonamy I deploy with young whippersnappers. And I would be luckier still if I knew which was the world in question.

Well, that's obvious in it. He said grammatically this time. See that little Runic symbol in the corner? It's a ticket to the wall in Middle Earth, the area north of ro Han. Are you speaking to me of tolkein I shrieked, almost vomiting. To write granddad, he said. Without a word, I thrust the ticket into his hand and staggered out of the bank, disorientated and bit dizzy and sick. After a week of shuttering. Just when I thought things were looking up, I was cast into black and bottomless despair. I took to my bed, and have been there ever since. As I toss and turn and nor my pillow. I wonder how a simple misprint could have turned my innocent desire to emulate Spandau Ballet into the nightmare of traumatic tacchini.

In the Old Testament book of hat guy, we learned that he that earned his wages, earned his wages to put it into a bag with holes. chapter one, verse six. I've always felt a pang of sympathy for that man, whoever he may be. As far as I'm aware, he's the only person in the Bible who carries a bag with holes, a bag so unlike the ones mentioned in Luke chapter 12, verse 33, bags which wax not old, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupters. Clearly, the hag Iron Man has allowed moths to corrupt his bag, and that's why it has holes in it. I can't help wondering if he's a little simple with man to be putting his wages into one mafia bag. Perhaps he is a prototype of the holy, innocent or the holy fool. That mythic figure, sorry, that mythic figure who had that resonance in Czarist Russia, among other times and other places, Rasputin certainly exploited the idea for all it was worth and although there is no reliable account of him roaming the corridors of the Winter Palace, carrying a bag with holes, I like to think he did. At the end, of course, his assassins had such trouble doing him to death that they shot him at least three times. So it is possible with any bag he had with him at the time, would have had a hole or holes caused by gunfire, even if it had escaped corruption by mouth. To my knowledge, no one has yet pursued a close study of moth infestations in the czarist palaces. But if someone with the requisite scholarly background were to do so, we may learn something of importance. I'm not sure whether the moths flying in weights to feed on Rasputin his bag would have been older moss or Angular or Terminal B Black Mountain black, the black veined broom cabbage, Crimson speckled Cynthia December Jew drinker, ear, early Emperor fishers esterline Fox garden pebble ghost goat great peacock Gypsy heart Hornet leopard lobster March Mele mouse Maslin NetID mountain, near northern winter, November Arash orange, pale turnip wax. Sorry, pale November, peppered Perce, Spanish moon, swallow tailed sweet Gale, turnip wax, white satin or winter moth. And I would like a topper lepidopterist with some knowledge of the fall of the Romanovs to tell me listeners should note that the bag of deceitful weight is not mentioned in hag guy, but can be found in my car, chapter six verse 11. It would not surprise me to learn that Rasputin had such a bag to give them that he was a deceitful monk as well as the Mad Monk of legend. his bag of deceitful weights and bag with holes may have been one and the same, of course, a possibility which makes the brain real. This is the kind of historical conundrum that the great pamphleteer Dobson ought to have written a pamphlet about, but never did. If we had, we might be a little further away from bag quandary. And a little closer to bag truth. Bag truth sounds like a Yoko Ono escapade. So the still small voice of common sense whispers in my ear, be silent now be silent.

Sorry about the slight Miss reading in that list of moths. I kind of inadvertently invented the pale turnip moth. Maybe I should read the whole thing again and get it right this time, but you know, life's short. Here are simple instructions to retrieve that state of being where the boot is on the other foot. Let's assume you're a bite paid of the kind known as a pauper by paid your papadum afford you bought one boot. In the normal run of things during your waking hours when you're out and about begging for alms, you will have one foot shot in the boot and the other bear or perhaps in socked or partly wrapped in trailing strangles of pasty it's best to carry out the following maneuvers in front of the mirror so you can see what you're doing. Let us say the boot is on your right foot. In the mirror, it will look as if it's on your left foot, but a moment's reflection Whoa, whoa, should suffice to confirm it's on your right now, sit on a clump leaned over and taking the boot in both hands. prise it off your foot. You may wish to avert the nasal passages as you do so. If the now and booted foot is bear, it's a good idea at this point to transfer onto it the sock or ragged scraps of Patty from the other left foot, which will appear to you in the mirror as the right you can also go and dip it the right foot into a nearby reel or stream. Keep an eye on your boots as you do so However, for the land is riddled with Britons who might make off with your boots while your incommode did with one foot in running water. Back on the clump, jam your left foot, the right one in the mirror. Remember, into the boot stand up. The boot is now on the other foot compared to where it was before you started. It's worth noting that this is a pastime the Pauper can enjoy with much more ease than the rich man. When there is only the one boot as with the Pauper is his child's play to keep track of what you're doing. The rich man possessed as many boots and many mirrors can often become hopelessly confused by the maneuvers and fly into a rage throwing boots about his palace and inadvertently smashing mirrors.

Finally on this week's hooting yarder on the air dedicated to the Ned stir on his birthday, a question and the question was posed on the hooting website. And, as you will hear, I asked for answers to the question, and I've only actually received one answer. And unfortunately, there isn't time to read the answer this week. So next week's show will begin with the answer to the question. But what is the question? Well, in Act Three, scene three of deaths just book or the fools tragedy by Thomas Lovell beddoes 1829 is brand who is the fool or Jester asks an important question. What is the lobsters chuen when he is boiled? Alas, he doesn't answer it, but goes on to sing a song about an unborn ghost, a Nile crocodile, and other little grunt plus fairy hog. This is all very well, but I still want to know about the lobsters tune. Can any real can any listener point me in the right direction? Are there any contemporary cover versions? And the question again, what is the lobsters tune when he is boiled? The sole answer I have thus far received will begin next week's hooting out on the air here on resonance 104 point four f m, the greatest radio station in the world. Even if Dave Lee Travis doesn't have a show on it yet. Bye bye.
