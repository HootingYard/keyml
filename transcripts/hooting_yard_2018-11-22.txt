Good evening before this week's hooting yard on the air, we have a police announcement. Police are asking for the public's Assistance in finding hunting down. A man who's wanted in connection with a crime and they gave the following description. His body is more pure, transparent and translucent than crystal. And as light and buoyant as air. in it are vessels and streams of light which enter and exude through the pores. The vessels are charged with liquors of the various colors and events brilliancy, and transparency. Some of these fluids are water, milk, wine and fire. Every motion of his body produces ineffable harmonies. Every creature obeys him. Nothing could resist or injure him. He is taller than men of his time. His hair is short, cold, and approaching black. He has a little down on his lower lip. In his stomach is a clear fluid, like water in a crystal bowl, in which tiny eggs develop themselves like bubbles in wine, as he glows with the ardor of divine clarity, when he strongly desires that others should unite with him in the work of praise. He deposits some of these eggs, which hack and from one of them emerged, his consoled. The man whose name is given as Adam is wanted for aiding and abetting a theft committed by his console. She stole an apple from a tree.

Frank Key  03:00
That was a physical description of of Adam, the original Adam of Adam and Eve, given by the 17th century mystic, antoaneta. Boy, no. And so you will know Adam, if and when you see him. And sure about those eggs. That seems a bit strange, but I'll read something else. Now, you may have to bear with me because regular listeners will know that I have the most useless eyes. In fact, I've been injected with various curative fluids about 20 times now. But I have these ridiculously magnifying spectacles, which assist me in reading. But I don't know what's happened over the last week or so. But I can't see as clearly as I would have hoped. Anyway, I will try. But if I get if I if I sound hesitant and stumble over words, you'll just have to bear with me. And if things get really bad, I'll just hand over the pansy cradle Drew, who happens to be here with me. She's knitting at the moment, you'll be pleased to know that she's ready to be called him if need be. But anyway, let me see if I can actually read something without getting too blue. Here we go. Oh, to be in Pepin Stowe among the Tom disk adept, which will stand in a ring around the bonfire, breathing in the fumes and snorting like hogs on the other hand, might not be safer to be barricaded indoors. Han shuttles with a pile of rags ready to set fire and fleeing from the rooftop. Whenever I find myself in such a quandary, I seek counsel from my power Aesop, who lives in a tin hat at the end of a long and bosky line. I set off to see him taking with me two loaves of bread. And on the way I sold what, sorry. I set off to see him. taking with me two loaves of bread along the way, I sold one of the loaves and bought a hyacinth an aesthetic touch I learned from sweepy Appleyard I stopped bored, I knew happily wolf down the bread while I contemplated the flower, which we would plop into a vase on the window sill or mantle piece. Perhaps I should point out that a salt was not named after the ancient Greek fabulist, though people invariably assumed that that was the case. After all, one meets with very very few a Sox these days. And I cannot think of anyone else of my acquaintance who goes by that name. As far as my power was concerned, it was simply that his mom and pop like the name, his sister was called a tosser for the same reason. And not because the parents had a thing about the daughter of Cyrus the Great, and mother of zucchi, Xerxes I, in fact, they were a mother of Xerxes, the first sorry. In fact, they were an ignorant pair who knew nothing of the ancient Greeks, nor of ancient Rome, nor Sparta, nor Carthage, nor of the Chaldees. And it must be said that Aesop himself was pretty thick. Quite the dimwit one of the reasons I brought the highest in was to give me something to concentrate on while he gobbled down the loaf. His table manners were absolutely awful like catheters. The mat the miraculous thing about Aesop was in spite of his stupidity, he always dispense judicious advice, at least on matters related to tongue dism. He had to say once been an adept himself, unlikely as that may seem, though, before brown and inarticulate and unsanitary, he had been privy to the mysteries. It was never clear to me whether they

Frank Key  07:45
drummed him out, or if he had to escape their toughest clutches. But either way, he now has to remain in hiding in his tin hat at the End of the Lane, sheltered by clumps of about laburnum, hornbeam and pine, those being the four kinds of Cree which grow in and around Pepin stone, by dint of the soil conditions. I am tempted to salary off on a digression regarding the many proclamations about soil, those dealing with dry crumbly soil, the winning of the winnowing of it through sibs, the transformation of soil into mud through the agency of rain or ditch water, the commingling of soil with blood on battlefields scarred by war, the distribution of pebbles within expanses of soil, soil the home of worms, as of untold creeping things, the cloudy nature of impacted soil and the engine of inspection, whether organic or machine circumstances of soil pulverization thoughts agricultural horticultural and botanical and the related yet separate issues important to tandis of dry soil and day soil and night soil and the employment of night soil men, their wages and duties and equity bars, but always can be studied more profitably at source. For example, in one of the many Tom disk soil journals publicly available.

Frank Key  09:30
The unholy snorting and bellowing of the Pepin stole chapter of Tom this could still be heard, frankly, as I approached ever closer to a sock. 10 heart smothered under the clumps at the end of the line. It was 745 in the evening, time, this time, when I bashed my fist on the door, the loaf of bread was still fresh and the hyacinth on wilted at 746 the door creaked open to myself Surprise. There in the vestibule stood not Aesop. But his sister a Tata, whom I had not seen for many years. She did not recognize me, and she is as much a Dunder pate as her brother. So I had to explain at length who I was, and why I had come a calling, and why I held in one hand a loaf of bread in a paper bag, and then the other hand, not in a bag, a hyacinth. By the time I was done with all the rigmarole, enunciated in ringing tones, the better to penetrate a tosses wax blockaded, is, it was 752 it needs hardly be said that time is of the essence tandis addressed to those whose quandaries skitter within a tundish purview. Soon enough, it will be eight o'clock and the bonfires in Pepin. Stowe would be at their height, ready for burnings, and not any old burnings but tandis burnings. A tosser scowled. But she led me into the heart pointing with her Shrek shriveled white hand to the carpet, where I saw blade sprawl in the gleam in the gloom. I thought he was dead. But of a sudden he leaped to his feet and shook my hand with his usual muscular vim, making me wins. He snatched a loaf of bread and began gobbling, paper bag and all. An empty vase stood on the mantelpiece, so I dropped the highest int into it, and set for contemplation. When you finished eating Aesop, perhaps you could advise me on my quandary, I said, I am in two minds whether to join the list a depth, standing a ring around the bonfire, breathing in the fumes and snorting like bears, or conversely, with my hat of caution on my head to be barricaded indoors behind shutters with a pile of rags ready to set fire and fling from the rooftop. What say you, pow Aesop. They still had his mouth full of bread, so I waited for the quandary to launch in his brain during his chewing. What I did not expect for his was for his sister a tosser to jump straight in with her own unsolicited advice. You are not in Pepin stone anymore, you have entered into the tin hut of a tosser, as it shall henceforth be known. Here, all these dim both light and width. Stay with us, Mister, for at eight o'clock sharp. We shall be well that in the air on storm tossed, currents blowing so ferociously. We shall want to for ballast. It was a minute to eight, I had for 60 seconds to decide my fate. That very moment I stopped, swallowed his last mouthful of bread belched as he does, fixed me with his black vacant eyes and said I forget exactly what he said. For he was inarticulate. Though I recall, there was something about soil, possibly night soil. I threw myself out of the I threw myself out of the tin out, just as it was lifted clear the ground by storm tossed currents. Later, back in pepinster though, I saw the tandis fires burning the adepts were silent now and ominous. I crept in shadow past my chalet all the way past and it until I reached the kiosk of the Knights, oil men. It was empty, safer a coat hanger on which hung a brand new uniform. I tried it on it was a perfect fit. Night would fall soon, soon, and I would be ready.

Frank Key  14:54
Right I'm going to try and read something else without too much. pausing and stop Bring

Frank Key  15:05
Mike Spandau Ballet. Sorry, I'm gonna let me rephrase that. Like Spandau Ballet, I bought a ticket to the world. I wish I'd paid more attention at the counter. However, because there was a misprint, I hesitate to say whether it was accidental or deliberate. And what I'd actually bought was a ticket to the world. Now, I'm as much an aficionado of ranges of hills consisting of open country overlying a base of limestone or chalk as the next man. But my ticket did not specify which wall I could gain admittance to. I assumed it would be a walled within the Lincolnshire wild till the Yorkshire Wolds or the Cotswolds but could narrow it down no further. I suppose I could have gone back to the kiosk where I bought the ticket. But frankly, the person behind the counter frightened the whipped out of me. Without going into details, just imagine a combination of Rolf Harris, Douglas Bader and BLT, Bob, I knew we'll have some idea why I hadn't stopped shuttering for a week. For it was indeed a whole week before I was able to really put my mind to working out which walls to go to. There's so many distractions apart from the shuttering. I had to deal with our big nose, bloating crises, six in number like Nixon, Dungeness moth, embrittlement, flotillas, geese, hens, ice maidens, jigsaw puzzles, kinetic sculptures, lemonade and monkeys, to say nothing of the second half of the alphabet. I think I must have I think I must have misread something there because I don't. Anyway, you get the idea. And it was a wonder to me that the issues I had to deal with presented themselves in such an intractable order. I was impatient for W to fold you because I thought I would then be able to investigate the world. But an influx of wax paid to that formed hope. Eventually having managed to having married with some panache to tip a zombie off the end of a pier. I took my ticket out of my pocket and gave it a closer look. Surely there must be some indication in the wording regarding the wall it was a ticket to But no, I, I even put it under a microscope. When I paid a visit to a lab for other reasons of which you need not be a prized for you know nothing of science, at least not of the science that concerned me, which is my own special field buster. After pouring pointlessly either gas or tears for hours on end, it suddenly occurred to me that the wild refer to one my ticket might not be a place but a person. Could it be the ticket, I would have to present to a century to pass through the cemetery gates to visit the tomb of turd Wald, the Norwegian politician who died in 1972, or the grave of Herman Wald, the Swedish statistician who met his Baker 20 years later. It might even be a ticket to grant me an audience with a living world earling world The American composer or on the same continent, the politician john s world are back in Scandinavia assuming among the living rather than the dead. Seuss involves the Danish actress a trip to the United States or Norway or Sweden or Denmark would cost rather more than going to Lincolnshire all your clear all the cuts, so I made an appointment to see my bank manager. He is almost as frightening as the man who told me my ticket, but in a different way. Not so much Rolf Harris and Douglas Bader and Beelzebub. Ringo Starr with indigestion on a sniper rifle, but needs must when the devil drives. So there I was sitting in the bank waiting to see Mr to combat clutching my ticket to the world in the fruitless hope that I would become bored become clear, when unexpectedly all became clear. Sitting next to me was a pale, spotty team person to whom I suspected shampoo was a rare unexplicable substance. He turned to me and said Wow, you lucky get in it.

Frank Key  20:04
I overlooked it ungrammatical infant infelicity, and asked where in lay my good fortune, you've got a ticket to the world. He said, I have indeed young with a snapper, I replied with the easy bonhomie I deploy with young whippersnappers. And I would be lucky as sterile if I knew which was the wall in question. Well, that's obvious in it. He said, grammatically this time. See that little Runic symbol in the corner? It's a ticket to the wall in Middle Earth, the area north of rohhad. Are you speaking to me of tolkein I shrieked, almost vomiting. To write granddad, he said, without a word. I thrust the ticket into his hand and staggered out of the bank, disorientated and be determined to the sick. After a week of shuttering Just when I thought things were looking up, I was cast into the into blackened bottomless despair. I took to my bed and have been there ever since. As I toss and turn and nor my pillow. I wonder how a tiny misprint could have turned my simple and innocent desire to emulate Spandau Ballet into the nightmare of chromatic told Kini twaddle.

I'm going to take a few moments to read you some bedtime stories. One of the most valuable lessons life has taught me is to know the difference between salvation and salvation. It is so easy to confuse the two especially in one's youth. When I was a young whippersnapper nipper long ago, I would regularly insert an eye when one was not needed, or omit an eye where the high heavens cried out for one. I knew I was not the only pimply young shaver to commit these errors. Over the decades, I have had conversations with hundreds if not thousands of people who were and in some cases still are fuddled by the difference. It should go without saying that confusing the two though can have serious ramifications. That is another word Incidentally, with which I have had a problem. I would commonly omit not just an eye but also an A, giving it as grammar fictions. This was because I thought I had it had something to do with stories about sheep. My dear departed ma would regularly read to me a bedtime story about a sheep named Dolores, whose fleece became snagged on a wire fence, at the edge of a field on a farm in a fictional place called tippy dopey land. As her name indicates, Dolores was a you rather than a ram. So even if such a thing as a ram fiction existed, which it did not, except within my little hat, her story would not have been, her story would not have been one. But that was just something else that confused me as a child. When I heard the word you, I thought the speaker was referring to you. I suspect this was because when it was my dear departed paws turn to read me a bedtime story, he invariably chose to recite in an eerie voice, the moon and the yew tree by Sylvia Plath. The result was that I found my story of Dolores frankly incomprehensible. The Plath poem, on the other hand, with its fumie, Spiritist mists and see like a dark crime and banging bells and bats and owls, and the moon, bald and wild, and the blackness in the silence, I found almost unbearably thrilling. So much so that I began to salivate. I would often slobber onto my pillow before paul got to the end of the poem. Of course, I confused my salvation with salvation, and imagined Jesus was about to come and pluck me from my bed. And take me to his bosom and up to heaven, where he wanted me for a sunbeam. Now as it happened, if Maya and Paul were called away to a night rally, my dear departed uncle Ned read my bedtime story, which for him was always chapter five of part three of travels into several remote nations of the world in four parts. By lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, then a captain of several ships. That is why throughout my childhood, I was convinced I was a cucumber.

Frank Key  25:55
Thank you very much, pansy. And I'll end this week with Baldwin and for jen siac. Broadway was murdered as she had an orange head. She played spinet with grace Erlang, the day before she weighed she married a man called full gentech one of these anchor yob, his nose was as the beak of a crow, and he soon lost his marbles. Baldwin hired a robin boat and glided across the lake. She gathered her herbs and flowers and infusion for to make this will set your brain to rights to drink it for gente ack. She said, when she rewrote the like as soon as she got back. But there was rotten ergot in her bubbling hot to same. So when her husband drank it, he went permanently insane. Baldwin had to train him up in the attic of their Chateau. And even after always, and Ever After all her days were filled with grief. And Whoa. If this story has a moral, it is one I have forgot. Just be very wary of contaminated a god. And that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And of course today it's the 55th anniversary of the assassination of john F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. So what I suggest you do is immediately get yourself a copy of reclaiming history by Vincent Bugliosi, a book of about 1500 pages, which proves conclusively as we all know, that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. And all the conspiracy twaddle is just twaddle. And if you don't believe me, read Bugliosi because he goes over every single detail. It's a magnificent book. And that's the end of this week's show. Bye bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:15
Life's like that, isn't it? me the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans of nerds who wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
