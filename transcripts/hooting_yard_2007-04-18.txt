The cam as if approaching of a Yata of Ehrlich and coming into His presence, bows, brings his drum up to his forehead and says mirboo mergo. Then he declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts. This is meant to indicate that Ehrlich is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his Yatta. The frightened cam leaps backwards towards the door, but gathers fresh carriage and again approaches Ehrlich's throne. After this performance has been gone through three times. Ehrlich speaks, wing add creatures cannot fly however, beings with bones cannot come. How have you Ill smelling black beetle made your way to my abode. Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air My name is Frank key. And that was a quotation from shamanism in Siberia by a chaplain. How have you all smelling black beetles made your way to this show? I'm sure you're not all smelling or Beatles. A topic of consuming interest to a number of people is the manner in which detective Captain Kirk pan cut his crime fighting chops. So in passion to some of those that there is a weekly magazine to cater to their needs in title Oh carc pan that Vout were with a still in which beetle Brad fans with nothing better to do publish lengthy and frankly tedious disquisitions upon the early cases of the renowned copper. A short extract will suffice to give you some idea of the kind of thing you can read in this magazine. Later that summer, carc Pan was assigned to the team which had been trying fruitlessly to solve the mysterious case of the pod persons from porlock. acting on a tip off from combine, the ambitious young detective took fruit with him his first briefing, his plans were bruised, but he calculated correctly that the investigation would no longer be fruitless. His colleagues on the case work Kandinsky for arrow rush a pabulum squit cranes neck Solomon Gilly Blatt hinges Darjeeling mens Sana pillar pap kuben Houben Thera panty CAC and tubin wesc. flopper Ruskin Whistler Pinkerton booboo concept album where with all fanfares desk Sergeant grease jacket desk Sergeant grease jackets performing monkey flamboyant man elsebeth duck wind live and grow rata last Pompidou and vampire threadbare pot gak snap tittle pan for lawn risk assessor cow fat loon Hoon battlin goon Fang Chow hanger lip, Kim Park goon trilby Baxter syrup slop Shandy Martin Amos war gatherer poopsie Clutterbuck poopsie Clutterbuck, crippled nephew Simon, whose name was Peter, a pool of seconded temporary volunteers, and some horses all under the command of super Captain Firestone copy, no relation to the legendary cyclist of that name. Anyway, this is the kind of thing that the old car kapan that there were with us still readers adore. No doubt it took prodigious research to compile that list of team members. But those of us with a less specialist approach are left wondering how or even if the case of the pod persons from poor luck was solved. The author of the piece does not tell us nor does she follow up the ramifications of cargo pants provision of a basket of fruit. Later in his career, of course, like many fictional detectives, Detective Captain kargh pan had a trusty assistant or Watson to his homes, you will find no mention of beppo in the umpteen thousand pages of the bound volumes of oak og pan that there were with us still held in the reference library at pointy town, nor in any of the myriad other journals devoted to the cutting of kg pans crime fighting chops. beppo was not yet born when the great detective joined the Constabulary. And it was not until the famous case of the politician, the lighthouse and the trained cormorant that the diminutive helpmeet appeared on the scene.

Interestingly, this case is one that the aforementioned Dr. Watson attributed in passing to Sherlock Holmes, Watson made this something of a habit for he also tried to claim credit for a number of karg pannon beppo adventures, including the singular affair of the elementium crotch, the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby, the banker, the arrest of Wilson than a Tory is Canary trainer, and the one in which is a Dora paisano, the well known journalist and dualist was found stuck staring mad with a matchbox in front of him, which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science. Such true life tales of detection and derring do have thrills generations. What is less well known is that when kargh pan eventually retired from the force, and went off to some rustic backwater to keep the bees and wasps beppo struck out on his own as a private investigator. Very few of his solo adventures have ever been made public, possibly due to their unremitting tedium. Poor beppo was unfortunate, in that he was only ever employed by clients fretting about the state of their taps, or their hedges, or a defective electric socket, or a cat in a tree or a last bus pass. He took to drink and was last heard of wandering aimlessly around the gloomy suburbs of Tam tower a beam, emitting Noxious Fumes with every breath and shouting his head off at snack bar hooligans.

This show began this week with that quote, from shaman ism site in Siberia, one of my favorite quotations Here is another quotation. This one is from Thomas harmons book a caveat or warning for common curses vulgarly called vaga bones, written in 15, or published in 1566. These palliatives be called also klappa dungeons. These go with patched cloaks and have their malts with them which they call wives. And if you go to one house to ask his arms, his wife, she'll go to another for what they get as bread, trees, molds and wool. They sell the same for ready money for so they get more than if they went together. Although they'd be thus divided in the day, yet they meet jump at night. Father understand for truth, that the worst and wickedest of all this beastly generation, a scarce comparable to these prating pally odds, all for the most part of these will either lay to their legs an herb called spear word or the arsenic which is called rat Bane. The nature of this spear word will raise a great blister in a night upon the sound is part of his body. And if the same be taken away, it will dry up again and no harm, but this arsenic will so poison the same leg or saw that it will ever after be incurable, this they do for gain and to be pitied. The most of these that walk about be Welshman. now onwards as a service to all listeners who have a bulfinch to feed, I've consulted that invariable reference work in choir within upon everything, the 1856 edition, which tells us old birds should be fed with German paste number two and occasionally rapeseed. The Germans occasionally give them a little poppy seed and a grain or two of rice steeped in Canary wine, when teaching them to pipe as a reward for the progress they make. Bird organs or flandreau lots are used to teach them. Now that inquire within talks about old birds should be fed with German paste number two, but no information is given about the feeding of young bullfinches which I would have thought would be a more urgent matter. Anyway, having installed your bulfinch in suitable accommodation, you'll be wondering where to get your German paste number two. I recommend Joseph stere and sons manufacturers of poor men's places and German paste at number two mint street opposite St. George's church Bara High Street, London as he last time I checked in 1873 the business was thriving while you are there, pick up some of their poor man's places in case your bulfinch picks you with its fears lacerating beak, or a taxi with its talons, which it may well do if you mistakenly feed it German paste number one orange Number 46. And while we're on the subject of going out and about in London if you've been to Barrow High Street in 1873 to get your German paste in 2007 this year between Friday the 28th of April and Thursday the 26th of April. If you go to the window gallery at 107 to 109, Charing Cross Road, which is basically what it says it's a gallery in a window. So visible from the street. You can see Requiem for pink flamingo, an exhibition of flamingos from the collection of Claire Harmer. I don't often do things you know a what's on guide here on hooting yard although a couple of weeks ago I sent you to a tutor hat making workshop. Don't know if any of you went to that, but Rhett highly recommended Claire harmos Requiem for pink flamingo at the window gallery on Charing Cross Road. Now at the moment, we have a problem with the music because it doesn't fade in and out. So it might be a bit abrupt but just bear with us.

Frank Key  11:19
In fact, we're having a complete disaster area with the music and so I'm just going to have to keep talking. So if I pause occasionally to sit from a sign of something or other. We have a visitor we're gonna we're sorting out live on air. We're sorting out the music bear with us.

Frank Key  11:45
Well, I'm gonna read something while while to dedicated engineers try to sort out the thing with the music. And I'm sure it's all going to go well. But don't worry about the background noise. That's the sound of people hard at work. A while ago, the hootin yard website was graced with an illustration from the adventures of the men with whisks. Quite a few readers had their memories stirred by the picture of a straight peasant being bashed on the head with whisks taken from the men with whisks set upon the peasantry in a whirling tangle of violence 1952 once one of the most popular this seemingly forgotten series of children's books, Ruth pastry, for example, wrote in to say, thank you so much for reviving my memories of the adventures of the men with whisks. When I was a tiny tot, I had an almost complete set of these wonderful books, and sell them that I fall asleep at night, without having one read to me by my mother or my father, or if they were indisposed by the family factotum Igor. My favorite volume was, the men with whisks are attacked by a giant invisible squirrel with blood soaked fangs, and I particularly treasured the scene where they cower in a Spinney, trying desperately to scrape from their whisks the rust with which their utensils have become unaccountably caked. Dr. pastry goes on at length about the psychological impact of the men with whisks upon her infant tile brain. But the rest of her letter is riddled with incomprehensible jargon, misplaced punctuation marks, and some sort of grotesque spillage, so I shall not even try to read it out. There were over 30 books in the series, all but the last two written and illustrated by pastors tack the manuscript of what would have been his final adventure. The men with whisks visit a toothpaste factory, perished with him in the Munich air disaster of 1958. Although his sexual was recovered from the wreckage, its contents had been destroyed. For many years, a rumor circulated that the last story had been memorized by the Manchester United manager Matt Busby, who survived the crash. Busby became adept at deflecting questions related to the men with whisks, much as in later years, the one time Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros Ghali always refused to confirm or deny that he had been abducted by aliens, no matter how hard he was pressed by zombified conspiracy theorists. It is certainly not the case that the last two books the men were the whisks tuck into a slap up dinner of cocktail sausages and potato pie. And the men with whisks beat Benfica for one in the European Cup final were written by the buzzbee himself under the pseudonym Geraldine screwin. Hoon Puj forensic examination of the manuscripts put paid to this absurd theory, as did an affidavit signed by Miss Gruen Hoon Puj, herself, attesting that she had been visited during her sleep by the spirit of perhaps just tack, who dictated the stories to her in an ethereal but dull monotone. These last two volumes are of course, on illustrated. Every single one of the adventures of the men with whisks is now out of print. Yet there are many like Dr. Ruth pastry who remember them with fondness. Surely the time is ripe for a revival in our post literate age, maybe it will take the imprimatur of a Hollywood adaptation to spark the interest of a new generation. So if you have any battered old copies of the books in your attic, dig them out, photocopy them, and send the copies to, I don't know, Jennifer Lopez or Tom Hanks. We're not going to see if the music works. After all that faffing about in the background, which I'm sure didn't disturb your enjoyment of the story.

Scenes from the lives of the poet's number one, mod AB Deb My name is mod AB Deb. I am the woman who ate blood oranges within vodka. We sat together in uncomfortable beach chairs without speaking. My Albanian was rusty and I was in or and he saw I was in or and he relished my or. juice from the blood oranges dribbles down our drawers, from the discomfort of his beach chair and vodka directed my attention to the left. I looked and saw a rowing boat and the rowing boats oars. The oars were too small for the rowing boat, or the rowing boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at Enver hacia. After a pause he rose and pulled from his pocket length of goals. When he went he shook my hand, but he did not let fall the goals he spoke then he said he had to go and draft some new Albanian laws. I recall nothing more.

Following scenes from the lives of the poet's a guide to pointy town, pointy town, which pointy town turns up in a number of pieces on hooting yard as you as you no doubt know. And occasionally I get asked questions about it, you know, more detail. Where is it? That kind of thing? So here's, here's a brief guide to some of the key facts about pointy town. pointy town lies just south of the port of tongs and is famous for its amusing biscuits and cakes, dustbin exhibitions, ferocious geese, horrible icing sugar jewelry, kaleidoscopic lettuce Museum, never open, public quacking recitals, squalor, tortoises utopian vinegar works and xanthine ie yellow zucchinis the few squares that existed in pointy town before the revolution were used as ostrich colonies and horse laundries, rather than as they are today, places of lasciviousness and grotesquerie. the triumph of marmalade square, in particular fenced round with a rude wooden railing, interrupted by lumpfish brick piers at intervals of every half dozen yards, partakes more of the character of a pond than a parterre. And as for Kevin Costner square, it is very much the air of a sorry cow yard, where blackguards are to be seen assembled daily, playing at hustle cap up to their ankles in Maya. Yet pointy town is no utopia. For instance, you will find in the town, no trace whatsoever of quaintness, ry euphonium rehearsals, toffee, yogurt, Yulia lating idiots, ornithological paraphernalia, athletics, sawdust, dockyard, flamboyance, gases Hydros jugglers, kissing lovers zelis X ray i'd cadet and visigoth brand new Garmin trees. But who needs any of those things when there are great architectural Marvels to be seen. One of the most striking and gigantic buildings in pointy town is the old wretched flophouse. The principal front on the land side is considerably more than one third of a Jarvan mile in length, and its wings in depth, extend 672 feet down to the edge of the big frightening River. This noble watercourse, forming the fourth side of the quadrangle within the three sides, the big frightening river and two wings are ranges of parallel buildings, which form the magazines artificers shocks, masts and boat houses, offices, etc. And in the area within these are four slips for building the largest and two for the smaller classes of tug boats of pointlessness. The whole of the outer range of buildings consists of lamentable suites of rooms, and long and fearfully ornamented galleries filled with the natural history and curiosities collected in every part of the globe, and brought by different navigators, which pointy town of late years has sent forth on Discovery. in one room are assembled all the different nautical and mathematical instruments in another all the models of toy Brazil nuts of different nations in different eras. In another a complete library connected with every branch of both human and inhuman knowledge. The library's most treasured item is the manuscript of the first draft of verkin, get Oryx seppo Vedas inane lines written upon first listening to Dr. Bogan broom by Dr. Dress by what? I'm going to read that again, the library's most treasured item is the manuscript of the first draft of vercingetorix, seppo Vedas inane lines written upon first listening to Dr. Bogan broom by Jethro Tull. A poem which goes like this. Oh, savage and vile and pink and bloated thing, cursed uncanny globule of despair, monstrous to so pale and covering its gleaming talons clawing at my hair. Has this being come to announce my Doom? its head is like a caffeine or a goal. It has been sent by Dr. Bogan broom invoked by minstrel wizards, Jethro towel.

There is or may have been an old superstition that every farmyard has its own fiend. It is said that Beelzebub personally allotted each themes to its farmyard and ratcheted up the fiendish pneus of his dastardly plan by making the themes extremely hard to identify. So for example, neighboring farmyards may have very, very different resident themes. A pig here, an old rusty iron pail, they're a one legged hand in one farm yard, and a big bright red tractor belching smoke in another. exorcising a farm yard of its field is thus fraught with difficulty for the average countryside exocyst stepping through the gate of a farm yard for the first time does not know where to begin to look. There is great disparity in the fiendish pneus of farm yard fiends and some diabolist have argued that Beelzebub treated the whole matter with an uncharacteristic lack of diabolic concentration. For every farm yard that is stricken by an energetic fiend. There are many more that can pass for years, even decades in untroubled, bucolic peace. But of course, it's the former that gained attention who can Forget the ruination visited upon screwed hunahpu farmyard in the 1930s all those crop failures, diseases, fires, murders, contaminations, and inexplicable bond collapses, which ceased only when a marauding nighttime squirrel was captured in a net by Father Dermot Boggess and subjected to the full rigor of his holy rough. It took six months for the exorcist to expel every last vestige of Englishness from the squirrel, leaving the poor, bushy tailed mammal thin and shriveled and exhausted and close to death. And yet, as it was slowly revived by the coddling of old mar purgative at her Verdun squirrel sanctuary, so too did the farm yard flourish a new with majestic fields of golden wheat, gleaming new buckets replacing the old rusty pails and happy happy pigs. You would be forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard themes is precisely the kind of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed, marigold Chu often pressed him to tackle the topic supplying the out of print pamphleteer with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations of an agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the ones popular monthly magazine, glimpses of farmyard ruin, and wrote many letters to the editor, some of which were published, and one of which October 1954 was selected as letter of the month, for which marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize was a very large hog with a brain disease, which went on wild rampages through the house. mischievously, the editor of the magazine, who had his own farm yard regularly used the monthly prize to rid himself of his own farm yard themes. Finally this week, and I have some news. And I have some news. In this age of pointless but seemingly obsessive rebranding. Apparently Snow White diminutive powers, the Seven Dwarves are to be given new names from next Friday. Apparently, there have been owners wretched, spiteful incontinent, wistful, lippy, rancorous and preening. And On a related note, pansy cradle drew has brought to my attention the growing debate over the identity of the eighth dwarf, a Kim's have a long running argument as to who exactly deserves the title of the fifth Beatle. pansy hopes to bring us the latest news on this important subject very, very soon. I can't guarantee though that that will be in time for next week's show, which will be on at the same time, and I'll be back then. Do have a good week. Bye bye.
