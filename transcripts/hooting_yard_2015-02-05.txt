Good evening This is resonance one or 4.4 FM My name is Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. I was thinking of devoting this entire show to a half hour long obituary for Rob McEwen, the croaky voice, horribly sentimental pack, singer, songwriter and poet who died at the age of 81. Earlier this week. Why he might ask? Well, I'm one of the few people I know who actually saw Rob McEwen live. There it was in the very early 70s. And I was not very old. And my father, for some obscure reason, was a big fan of Rob McEwen, which didn't really fit in with the rest of the things he liked, but he seemed to have this thing about Rob McEwen. So he took me probably because no one else would go with him to the Albert Hall to see Rob McEwen croaking and singing his terrible songs, although some of them were quite good, the ones who did with Jacques Brel, of course. Why am I babbling on about Rob McEwen? I don't know. I should stop now. I knew automobility is Dobson received a letter asking him to contribute to a symposium. Such invitations were rare for the out of print pamphleteer, I think became unreasonably overexcited, unable to think clearly. He walked down his breakfast and went for a brisk walk along the towpath of the canal, shouting and tracking pebbles at swans. When he arrived home sopping wet from the torrential downpour. He read the letter he had received. Apparently what the sender called his unique insight would be welcomed for a symposium on the importance of the cummerbund as a new romantic signifier with particular reference to Spandau Ballet. Dobson had questions, but unfortunately, his enamorado marigold crew, who he felt sure would know about these things, was off on a week long galavan. The pamphleteer had a vague idea what a cummerbund was. But that was about all of the symposium title he understood. He knew a bit about the romantics, but what was a new romantic? What exactly was meant by a signifier and most befuddling of all? Was there really a ballet troupe resident at Spandau Prison in Berlin? And if not, what on earth did the two words that's conjoined, refer to? These were his questions as he poured Excuse me. As he poured over the invitation, Dobson felt his excitement bubbling up again. He could barely recall when last he had been invited to anything, let alone an important symposium. Leaving the unanswered questions to waft in the midst of fuzzle he dashed off a letter of acceptance, not forgetting to ask that his bus fare be paid and a cup of tea provided. Then he crashed back out into the rain to buy a stamp at the post office and to plop his reply into a letterbox. On his way home along one of the less salubrious boulevards of pointy town, it occurred to Dobson that the answers to his questions could conceivably be common knowledge among the Riff Raff, it would not be the first time he discovered that things of which he was wholly ignorant, were known by the most wretched and unsightly specimens of a lot of other orders. A gruesome little twerp, for example, had once vouchsafed to the pamphleteer not only the names of the for Liverpudlian mop tops, but also told him which one was spectacles, and was married to an avant garde Japanese performance artist. This information had proved invaluable when Dobson came to write his pamphlet, several anagrams of eu nucky informed by my unique insight into popular culture out of print

Submit was that the pamphleteer buttonholed a number of hoi polloi in the street, shouting at the rabatt romanticism and signifiers and ballet in German prisons. But by now, the torrential rain had grown rainy and more torrential. And all those who's helped Dobson sort of swept past in, causing a new to curse or spit or kick. When eventually he made it home, he was none the wiser. Dobson sat at his escritor off hours, pencil poised over a blank sheet of paper. He was at a loss. Then he had a brainwave, he would go to the symposium and extemporize so long as he included the key words repeatedly in whatever he said, he felt sure he could carry it off. had not Laurence Olivier done the same when performing Shakespeare, babbling nonsense occasionally, just to amuse himself and to disconcert the rest of the cast. And after all, this was an academic symposium, when nothing anybody said would make the slightest bit of sense anyway. Dobson tossed his pen set aside and went to slump in an armchair, gazing out of the window that crows in the rain. The day before the symposium, a further meta arrived from the organizers did Dobson it read, I'm afraid we're unable to pay your bus fare and cannot provide you with a cup of tea. We are therefore withdrawing your invitation, Toodle Pip. In the spring and summer of his years, a younger Dobson would have parlayed this crushing disappointment into a pamphlet of sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. Now, he merely slumped at his escritor moaning and weeping for days on end, until marigold crew came home.

We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. Nora Ephron, the American writer described that song by Rob McEwen, she said, the more you examine it, the more foolish it becomes, or words that affect anyway, next time you go for a stroll along the appian way. Take a pair of shares with you. Then if you happen to encounter Harry slave hurrying along, you can see him and chop off his hair with the shares. When his bare scalp is revealed, you will be able to read the secret message tattooed upon his bonds previously hidden by his luxurious Buffon. The message will be intended for a distant military general or potentate, committed to memory. You are now in possession of important and privileged information, and knowledge is power. continue along the appian way until we reach the encampment of the general or the Palace of the potentate. Being not a Harry nor a slave, nobody will suspect you of being the carrier of the secret information. You can use this to your advantage in all sorts of ways. Next weekend hints and tips for ancient Romans, we will look at how you can influence the prognostications of a herro specs. By tampering with the hot end trails of a freshly slaughtered chicken.

I'm very much looking forward to the new 26 part television series, The stealthy camp, which begins next week. previews have not been available, but a few details have been leaked to the press. Very few, actually, the title, the number of episodes and the basic premise. I've told you the first two so let me know Move on wings unfurled to the third. The stealthy Trump centered around a camp who is stealthy. Each week the Trump tries to use his talent for stealth in us in some way. For example, creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark or lurking next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare, or taking part in a Google heist. But, as the series title indicates, while he is in Juba to be stealthy, he is also a Trump being a Trump each week, he manages to sabotage his own selfishness by making the sort of idiotic decision only a dyed in the wool chump would make. So when creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark, he carried with him a box of fireworks, which, through cat handedness with a box of matches, he manages to ignite all at once, plus, drawing attention to himself with lots of sparkly whizzes and bangs. When looking next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare, he wears a hat with a giant propeller on it, and the wind picks up and spins the propeller blades around and the stealthy champ finds himself hovering a few feet off the ground, making passes by gorp. When taking part in a jewel heist, he carries a box of fireworks and wears his propeller hat at the same time with predictable results. I haven't given the impression that the stealthy Trump is a comedy. On the contrary, by all accounts, it is the sort of drama invariably described as gritty. What this means is that it's set in the north of England, where the rainfall is incessant. several characters scowl and swear a lot and nobody ever smiles, not even the stealthy Trump himself. I suggested above that the title character was dyed in the wool and this is literally the case. Each week the stealthy chump wears an item of knitwear and the dye that has been used to color the wall has also colored this stealthy chump from head to toe. All his knitwear. As all his knitwear is dyed in brash and gaudy blues and pinks and yellows. The fact that his head is the same color means he finds it even more difficult to be in conspicuous and stealthy, and is thus even more of a camp. The selfie champ was filmed entirely on location in a municipal carpark. No animals were harmed in the making of the series, except for some ants and beetles and other creepy crawlies and an unfortunate trumpeter Swan that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I'm going to forget about Rob McEwen, you know, I think that's gonna be the best idea. I was. I decided to write a piece called Belshazzar feast. And I only managed to write one line because I wasn't really sure where where to go after writing the line. But I thought I'd I'd read that line out by itself. And in case anybody, anybody who wants to can use it as a gag after an Old Testament stand up comedy night. I've been to quite a few Old Testament stand up comedy nights, and they're a real hoot, I tell you. Anyway, so here's my joke. Here's my joke. Next time you go to an Old Testament stand up comedy night and they have an open mic bit where anyone can go and tell a gag and have them all laughing. The writing was on the wall for many men, a tech girl who fasten

Frank Key  15:12
I thought I might be needed to leave a bit more time to allow your laughter to dissipate, as you'll probably be still chuckling to yourself at that joke. Anyway, I got a letter from softeners buggles beak. Dear Mr. Key she writes, I'm writing to ask for your help. I have been commissioned by an important publishing house to compile a dictionary of fruit related popular music nomenclature. It's all been going swimmingly, but the letter P, I have reached an impasse. It has proved beyond my considerable wit to discover from what type of fruit the legendary pips who accompanied salting a Gladys Knight, what eked. It goes without saying that readers of my dictionary will expect chapter and verse on this one, and the book would prove a sorry specimen indeed, if it did not include this crucially important information. Given the astounding depth and breadth of your erudition, in so many spheres, it occurred to me that you could well be in possession of the pyp fact daddio as the young persons might say, I would be immensely grateful if you could tell me by return of post the answer to my query with references if possible, you will pleadingly soften his butt goals beak myth. Well, I'm afraid to say that I haven't got a clue. Dobson the Titanic pamphleteer of the 20th century compiled the similar Dictionary of fruit and not related jazz and blues nomenclature out of print, but the soul music of Gladys Knight and the pips fell out with his frame of reference. All I can suggest is perhaps you obtain High Definition photographic enlargement of the pips of every fruit with which you wish. I'm going to start that sentence again. All I can suggest is that perhaps you obtain High Definition photographic enlargement of the pips of every fruit with pips you can think of and then compare these with photographs of the pips. It is possible you might be able to note certain striking resemblance is, of course, it's equally possible. You might not. By the way, I cannot help wondering if you like your namesake soften his butt peel, daughter of the American painter, soldier, scientist, inventor, politician and naturalist Charles Wilson, Charles Wilson peel 1741 to 1827. I have three brothers named Raphael, Rembrandt and Rubens. Do let me know. Some of you might be more familiar with Charles Wilson pale than you think, because it was his painting. exhuming the first American mastodon, which was used on the cover of cue Roan, the 1977 album by Peter Blake vide john Greaves and Lisa Herman, of which there was recently a book published, Peter blagoevgrad. Put a book together. And I recommend that you buy that, not least because it has a contribution from Mr. Key in it. Yes, anyway, Robert Charles Wilson Peled had sons named Raphael, Rembrandt and Rubens and a daughter named soften his butt mask well worth knowing.

In his posthumously published essay how I wrote certain of my books, Raymond Roussel explained the methods he used to compose the works which he was confident would guarantee him immortality. As he wrote my fame without shine that of Victor Hugo or Napoleon, it was perhaps with the same ambition in mind. Excuse me. It was perhaps with the same ambition in mind that the itinerant Bible bashing tub thumping fire and brimstone preacher man, napkin linseed. paraphrase the title for his memoir, how I thumped certain of my tubs happily was published while he was still alive. linseed is an attractive figure if one is attracted to rakishly thin black clad figures of decidedly cool vine countenance who discerned the foul mismanagement of mortal sin everywhere they look. His personality comes across with striking force in his memoir, a book as fast as he was lean. In it, he describes in fascinating detail how he devised his tub thumping method. Though he has less to say about the bashing of Bibles. The book is highly recommended to any reader who wishes to embark upon their own tub thumping practice. As Lindsay gives chapter and verse on the procurement and preparation of tubs the most effective way to transport them. One song on either side of a horses Shanks, and of course, various approaches to something guaranteed to both definite and terrify one's audience. If, of course, one manages to attract an audience. often enough, this was the missing element in linseeds preaching tools. The memoir contains innumerable descriptions of the author standing in a rain swept field, thumping his tubs and bashing his Bibles and hurling determinable implications that nobody save for the occasional passing cow or goat. It is perhaps his most attractive feature, that napkin linseed never allowed himself to be discouraged by the widespread lack of interest shown in his preaching. He simply kept on going like a swordfish spearing the briny deep. I use that somewhat ungainly analogy in homage to napkin linseed himself, who deploys it repeatedly in his memoir. In some instances that appears several times in a single paragraph. And in general, the paragraphs themselves are fairly short and snappy, certainly shorter and snappier than it is only other published work. How I bashed certain of my Bibles. A time of writing Napoleon's fame probably out shines, Victor who goes Victor who goes out shines, Raymond drew sells, and resells out shines napkin linseeds. But who is to say that in 1000 years time, the order may not be reversed.

Finally on hooting out this week, some verse a song in fact, although I won't sing it, it's the kind of thing that perhaps I could try and a croaky rod mm acuity type voice but I'm not going to. I'll just read it to you. Although apparently it is being set to music by our A Spaceman of this parish actually not of this parish of a different parish entirely. Anyway, here's some verse to end the show. And as john told you earlier, next week will be a three hour special combining the opera our pull a plug, hooting out on the air and cafe Calcio, and many sounds very exciting. What will probably happen is we'll just be begging you for money for three hours. That's certainly something to look forward to, isn't it? Anyway, here's some verse debunkers Maisie thou art so fair, blind beetles scuttle through your hair. That unwashed tangle atop your head, wearing your brain poisoned by lead. You breathed in Oh, so many fumes. And now the gleam of madness loons behind your eyes or rather eye as you muck out the filthy pigsty. It was a pig took out the eye that's missing when we were in the pigsty kissing and it will. I shall never forget. The day was windy, cold and wet. But all days are in this rustic hell. Oh, bonkers Maisie my countryside Belle. They locked you up in the potting shed poisoned by lead poisoned by lead. It's enough to make you weep, isn't it? So that was bonkers. Maisie, and there was some other stuff there. And that's the end of this week's show. ending a bit early, but I haven't really got time to redo anything else. I suppose I could always send you to the heating yard website at hooting yard.org where you can read all this stuff and more. Something like 12 years worth of drivel. And if you enjoy fighting your way through the archives, why not send me some money you'll need the I mean, I know you'll need your money next week when you beg for it from resonance. So before you before you spend all your money on resonance, you might like to spend a tiny amount on Mr. Key. That's all for this week. Bye bye.
