Frank Key  00:20
rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich rich want to form point four?

Unknown Speaker  01:04
This is resonance 104 point four FM. It's six o'clock on Thursday, and that means it's time for Miss blossom partridges weekly digest with me, Miss Lawson Partridge, when I had a thrilling show for you this evening, so we had better crack on. My special guest this week is Mr. Frank key. Mr. Key is a writer who maintains some sort of web blog called hooting yard. Welcome to miss blossom partridges weekly digest, Mr. Key.

Frank Key  01:42
Hello, and thank you for inviting me onto your show.

Unknown Speaker  01:46
Oh, it's a great pleasure. Perhaps you could tell my listeners something about this so called web blog of yours, Mr. Key?

Frank Key  01:55
Well, as you say, it's called hooting yard and it contains teaming thousands of sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose, written by me, plus choice snippets of other people's work that takes my fancy and some pictures. In other words, it's similar to most other blogs on Hecht internet, except that it's far and away in the most best and most entertaining and morally instructive blog anybody could possibly imagine.

Unknown Speaker  02:26
I see. I do not think I will try to imagine such a thing as I prefer to keep my feet on the ground and not get carried away. I can't help wondering if perhaps you are living in a fool's paradise, Mr. Key? Yes, I think you probably are. Anyway, as I said, we must crack on. So I understand you have brought one of your stories to read to us. Is that right? Yes. And what is the title of this story?

Frank Key  03:01
It's called shriveled.

Unknown Speaker  03:04
shriveled. Just shriveled.

Frank Key  03:06
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
And what's it about?

Frank Key  03:09
It's about a man who finds a shriveled head in a sack.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.

Frank Key  03:17
Well, it's meant to be amusing.

Unknown Speaker  03:19
I don't think it would be very amusing to stumble upon a sack with a shriveled head inside Mr. K. gruesome and macabre, perhaps, but hardly amusing.

Frank Key  03:29
I'll tell you a story.

Unknown Speaker  03:31
I see. Well, I suppose you'd better go ahead and read it anyway. Mr. Key, please, thanks.

Frank Key  03:41
shriveled. When I removed the shriveled human head from the burlap sack, my first thought was that there must have been foul play, as detectives like to call it but I'm not a detective. And foul play seemed incongruous in this some dappled Meadow splattered with buttercups, candy and wild hollyhocks under a gorgeous blue sky. Just before stumbling upon the sack. I had been singing at the top of my voice, singing a happy song, one of my own devising a pan of praise to bees, extolling the virtues of these splendid buzzy insect and others dressed like a bee sort of in a black and yellow hooped jumper and black leggings and a black cap upon my head with a little bit of yellow on it. There was no capital hat of any sort on the shriveled head I took from the sack, just a few strands of filthy matted hair. I sat on the grass and took a pair of snippy butcher scissors out of my pocket, and gave the shriveled head a much needed haircut. And I made a little pile of the clippings on a patch of bare soil and set fire to it with a match and it blazed. So briefly sparking and crackling and then all what was left was a trace of ash. I plopped the shriveled head back into the burlap sack, swung it over my shoulder, and headed off towards old farmer frack pig farm. Singing luster me. No one knew how old farmer old no one knew how old old farmer frack was. And no one could remember a time when he was not squelching about in the mob but mad at all hours of the day or night, raising his pigs. As farms go, it was a tiny farm. But old farmer frack was a giant of a man by the standards of that land, and his pigs grew to giants to under his care. It was a mystery how he made his living say he never took his pigs to market to sell them. When they reach the size that made them too big for the tiny farm. He drove them up into the hills and let them loose. That is why dutiful parents want their children against going on wandering alone in the hills, and tell terrifying tales of giant rampaging pigs, which capture and carry off misbehaved infants in their big trumping drawers. I found old farm of fracking Gulf in a fog of calorie fumes in his kitchen. He was preparing his lunch, a concoction of junk hair, devil kidneys and Bluemont. He was cursing like a saber, for he had inadvertently drunk the kidneys and devil the hair. One of his pigs, not yet Titanic in stature, was rooting around the skirting board, looking perhaps for beetles or other creeping things. I patted the pig on its Shanks. If pigs have Shanks and placed my sack on the table. This might interest you old farmer frac, I said, helping myself to a tumblers worth of water from the spigot. Except for his maritime curses, learned when he was but a boy. old farmer frac was a man of few words, the eye the sack, and he eyed me, and he eyed his spigot. Then he put down his jug full of kidneys and open the sack with unnecessary vigor, causing the shriveled human head to roll across the table and toppled to the floor. To its credit, the pig ignored it. old farmer frac, stared at the shriveled head and immediately made the sign of the cross. I had no idea he was a pipe, pig farmer. I just snipped the gory locks off this gory find, I said, and then I burned them. I stooped to lift the head back onto the table. But old farmer frack clouded me with main force, and I crumpled to the floor, unconscious for a few seconds. I came to with the pig's snout in my face, the shriveled human head, with perilously close to one of the pig cloven feet, and I feared that it would be crushed should the pig become excitable and begin stamping? Thinking Fast, I reached my hand up and patted the pig soothingly. Previously, when I had patted his shank shank, or what I believe to be shanked, I'd done so in a perfunctory manner much one might Chuck a dog under the chin

Frank Key  08:39
now I will the pluck a three forces of botsman movement number seven a into my hand, that I might communicate absolute calm. At this point, old farmer frack smash me on the head with a spade typical of a farmer I thought to keep a spade in his kitchen, and then I passed out for hours. I was woken by the unbearable sound of a transistor radio blaring into my ears unbearable because on radio pipsqueak, it was apparently you today and the noise assailing me with the voice of the proposers, Paul Bano dog biscuits Heusen, a krisztian Irish millionaire given to taking court action to retrieve a pair of trousers and a hat. I lunged to deaden the sound in any way I could, and saw alfama frac looming above me is drowse smeared with vestiges of deviled hair, jugs kidneys and blood Monge. You brought me the wrong head? He said lagu briefly

Unknown Speaker  09:58
Is that it? Yes. I see well was interesting to listen to some cooking but I hope you won't mind Mr. Kay if I suggest that your story is is not quite the kind of thing we like to broadcast here on Miss blossom partridges weekly digest with me Miss blossom Partridge. My listeners prefer, I think to hear something a little more. How shall I say? Heart rending and valiant and emotionally wrenching?

Frank Key  10:36
Oh, sorry.

Unknown Speaker  10:37
Well It can't be helped. It's water under the bridge now. But perhaps next time you are invited to be a special guest on a show, you will take a bit more care to make sure that your babbling is better suited to what they call the audience demographic.

Frank Key  10:56
I'll take your advice.

Unknown Speaker  10:57
Yes, do most people find that when they take Miss blas and partridges advice their lives improve in measurably Really? Oh, yes, I could show you graphs. But that would be rather pointless on a radio show, wouldn't it? You would see the graphs but my listeners wouldn't

Frank Key  11:19
I take your point.

Unknown Speaker  11:21
I think we had better take a musical break. That means it's time for Miss blossom partridges weekly digest musical pick of the week. chosen by me Miss blossom Partridge. And my pick of the week this week is a sad song. She looks

Unknown Speaker  12:14
like Mary means God.

Unknown Speaker  12:21
Seems to me

Frank Key  12:28
just goes to show wrong bro.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
My kids

Frank Key  14:06
thought she was married.

Frank Key  14:20
shows just around

Frank Key  14:42
some

Unknown Speaker  18:36
That was the late Mr. Lou Reed is singing sad song from his album Berlin. This is Miss blossom Partridge is weekly digest with me, Miss blossom Partridge, and my very special guest this week is Mr. Frank key of hooting yard.

Frank Key  18:56
I didn't have you down as a Lou Reed fan, I must admit.

Unknown Speaker  19:00
Oh, yes. I've been in the fishing audio of Mr. Reed since the early days when he was in the Velvet Underground. Really? Oh, yes. I bought a copy of the Velvet Underground and Nico on the day of its release. I remember I queued up outside the groovy hepcat disc and record Emporium on pointy town High Street. Just to make sure I snapped up my copy.

Frank Key  19:28
There's that often made remark that only a few people bought the first Velvet Underground album when it was released. But after listening to it, all of them were inspired to form their own band. Did you form a band Miss Botham Partridge?

Unknown Speaker  19:43
Oh, indeed I did. We were called this blossom partridges, Crimplene top soil. Our songs dealt with subjects like knitting, and badgers, either dogs digestive biscuits and boiled weeds

Frank Key  20:01
sound great. Did you make any records?

Unknown Speaker  20:04
No. You were not meant to be interviewing me though. Mr. Key. This is my show and you are my guest. Please desist from asking me. difficult questions.

Frank Key  20:16
Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  20:18
Let's move on to the next part of my show. That's me Miss blossom Partridge of Miss blossom partridges weekly digest for the past few months on arrival radio station, which I will not deign to mention by name. There has been a very early morning program called tweet of the day. each weekday morning it features a song or cheer up or call or coup or hoot. or what have you have a different bird. I noted that certain birds have not been included in the series, and so I thought it would be a good idea to have Miss blossom partridges tweet of the week as a regular feature on Miss blossom partridges weekly digest. Would you like to kick things off by introducing our very first tweet of the week Mr. Key? Bear pleasure. Oh, good. Well, here is a piece of paper with the introduction written down. Just read it out while you speak into the microphone.

Frank Key  21:24
Okay. Welcome to miss Botham partridges tweet of the week, which is a much better radio item than the tweet of the day broadcasts on arrive on radio station, which I will not deign to mention by name. This week, we feature this tweet or song or carrot or core or coup or hoot. or what have you. Have the mute swan.

Unknown Speaker  21:57
That was the tweet of the week featuring the mute swan. on next week's tweet of the week, you can hear or strain to hear the giant mower.

Frank Key  22:10
I don't want to interrupt but I think you'll find that the giant mower has been extinct for hundreds of years. Well,

Unknown Speaker  22:17
what happened?

Frank Key  22:18
Well, they died out long before there was any technology available to make a sound recording of them.

Unknown Speaker  22:25
Are you suggesting Mr. Key that I didn't know that?

Frank Key  22:29
I'm just wondering how you're going to replicate their tweet or song or terrible call or coup or how to or what have you.

Unknown Speaker  22:39
If you knew as much about ornithology as I do, you would realize that the giant mower sounded not unlike a mute swan. not identical Of course, but not unlike really my in house sound recorders to record it a giant mower only last week from a glass case in the museum. I know what I am talking about here, so you better drop it. Okay. It's time now for our regular egg based pudding discussion. This week, I will be discussing egg based puddings with my special guest, Mr. Frank key of hooting yd Tell me Mr. Key. Do you ever feature egg based puddings on your web log?

Frank Key  23:27
I have done Yes. From time to time.

Unknown Speaker  23:31
And have you noticed that when you do, someone will always pop up to accuse you of over egging the pudding.

Frank Key  23:40
I haven't noticed that. No.

Unknown Speaker  23:43
Well, believe me, it's almost certain to happen. Every single time I become involved in an egg based pudding discussion. Sooner or later I will be told I am over egging the pudding. If not me, then the other person involved in the discussion will be cute accused of over egging the pudding. In fact, it might even be me who accuses them of over egging the pudding. After all, if you get your accusation in first, the less likely it is they will dare to accuse you of over egging the pudding. It's a question of tactics and timing.

Frank Key  24:23
I don't really have all that many egg based pudding discussions.

Unknown Speaker  24:27
You're having one now. That's true. So be careful what you wish for. Um, well. all well and good. Oh, hold on a moment. Someone's just come into the studio and handed me a piece of paper. Hmm. Apparently, Miss blossom partridges weekly digest has been cancelled, because I am over egging the pudding. So we have to end the show there, I'm afraid and this time next week. Mr. Key will be presenting his own show called hooting yard on the air.

Frank Key  25:06
You sound quite disappointed.

Unknown Speaker  25:09
I am.

Frank Key  25:10
Well, I'll tell you what, maybe you can be a guest on my show. If you promise not to over egg the pudding and drop that business of the sound recording of a stuffed giant mower in a glass box in a museum.

Unknown Speaker  25:23
Okay, I'll consider it. Perhaps I could sing a song. Yeah,

Frank Key  25:29
what song

Unknown Speaker  25:31
I could sing my very own arrangement of the black angels death song from the first Velvet Underground album. I've arranged it for my mellifluous dulcet tones, and a Bavarian pop band.

Frank Key  25:46
Well, sounds great. That's what you've got to look forward to next week, listeners on hooting yard on the air. Anyway, that's the very end of the very end of Miss blossom partridges weekly digest. Take it away, Percy Granger.

Unknown Speaker  27:10
I've been having a word with the producer in hopes that Miss blas and partridges weekly digest could continue.

Frank Key  27:18
And what did they say?

Unknown Speaker  27:21
They said no.

Frank Key  27:22
Really? badly. They said no. Well, I you can still be a guest and you can do your own power band. thing. Do you have your own own power band?

Unknown Speaker  27:35
I don't know. I was hoping you might be able to provide one on your show.

Frank Key  27:39
You can rent them. Okay. You can rent them there's a non power band rental Emporium. Is that right anyway? That I think that might be it for this week.

Unknown Speaker  27:54
Would you mind if I if I called a portion of your show Miss blas and partridges weekly digest.

Frank Key  28:00
You can do that. Yeah. Oh, by the whole show,

Unknown Speaker  28:04

Frank Key  28:06
