Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. If you're listening on a digital device, follow, like share, crumpled up in a heap and weep. This is hanging out on the air. My name is Frankie, and I'm going to read you a very old story from the last century called gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. It's in three parts. And I think I can read all three this in one show you you think by now I would you think one hour I'd have an idea of how much text occupied 28 minutes or so after 12 years of doing this show, but I'm afraid I still haven't really got a clue. So I'll read as much of it as I can. And if after two parts I don't think I've got time for part three, I'll stop read something else and read Part Three next week. Got that clear? Okay, here we go. Gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, part one, September 1894. I had been marooned on the island for 11 weeks when I discovered the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, rolled into a metal canister and wedged in a narrow crevice between two rocks. Taking a swig from my bag of turtles blood, I squatted on the ground and removed the diagram from the canister. They were about a dozen large sheets, rather frayed around the edges, but perfectly legible. The top left corner of each sheet had been stamped with an official device of the Bolivian administration, showing an escutcheon ziggurat, the helmet of a Conquistador the hand of God and abbreviations in neat metallic lettering. The signature of what I supposed to be a petty official had been scratched across each of the stamps in most ink, munching or welke, I turned my attention to the diagrams themselves. They were faithfully complicated. I am no architect, and at first all I could make out were mariadb lines meeting at angles and criss crossing each other seemingly at random. Most of the diagrams had been subjected to revision, and there was much evidence of the ratio over printing and churlish and then datian my studies were interrupted by a sudden and ferocious thunderstorm, shoving the diagrams hastily back into the canister. Unfortunately, carrying one of them, I hobbled back to my shelter, where my Viper was busy biting their head off on an identified rodent. tossing my crackers into the corner. I laid back on my palate and spent a profitable hour mucking about with bits of wire and driftwood to make a trap for bats. The life of a maroon on an island such as this is not unpleasing food is plentiful and easily gathered or slaughtered. The vegetation is lush and the animals are slow witted and crusting. On my very first day I was able to bash out the brains of a badger which trundled innocently towards me as I sat on the beach idling with my club. Quiet what a badger was doing on the island is beyond me. I've not come across any others. But I'm ever vigilant. I will not risk boring you by listing the stupendous array of equipment I managed to salvage from the wreck of the HMS tot of magnesium. Suffice to say the club was not my only weapon, nor my tire loss for a change of trousers.

I've told you that I'm not an architect. The truth is I cannot remember what I am. What trade or business I followed on dry land. Perhaps I was a jolly jack tar, but I think it unlikely I like to think that I was aboard the tot of magnesium as a supernumerary passenger, a merchant of salt. My cabin crammed with samples of tea or silk or mustard. In the final desperate moments, as the ship pitched and rolled and smashed against gleaming rocks, I received a blow to the head which has impaired my memory. It was not the only injury right received. My right leg is only just recovering. I was thankful that among the first items from the ship washed up on the beach with a wooden box of sinner prisms from the surgeon's casket in the first day of my marulan, the lifeless bodies of my shipmates were washed up on shore, white, puffed gruesome, I ticked off the date and an impromptu ledger, which I've since mislaid the bodies did not lie there long, enormous birds swooped out of the sky, hook the dead in their vicious beaks and bore them off. their nests are not on this island. I have searched every inch of it. The gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams came to light on one of my earliest searches. For the first few weeks, I was so sure of being rescued by passing smack or schooner that I could barely bring myself to move. I sprawled on the beach, knocking out the brains of a variety of curious animals, applying center prisms to my wounds, and caches, and covering myself with an old bed of sailcloth at night, or during rainfall. Last Ship hold interview, I hopped about like a mad thing shouting and raving in Latin, following the advice of my Jesuit mentors. Eventually, I realized that the craft I was hailing was none other than what was left of the top of magnesium seen from an advantageous angle. If the listener, you were expert in tides and currents, in the pleasingly complex science of the movement of seas, I would ask you how it was that this broken wreck of a ship sailed about for nine or 10 weeks without sinking, only to return to the spot where razor sharp rocks hidden beneath the waves have pierced its fabric and brought about it doom. But I suspect you are not. It was at this stage that I conquered my indolence and set to work. In 48 hours I salvaged everything I could carry from the ship, constructed a raft knocked up a shelter from planks and sailcloth knocked up another shelter when the first one collapsed on top of me. This time shoring up besides with some sort of metal, killed eight turtles made a store for buckets, dug some holes lost my death ledger. It pickled ran I found in the surgeon's casket and hardly paused for sleep. The next day I began my search of the island, I found a Mulberry Bush and some gemstones. On the second day I found bauxite deposits, a waterfall, big grains of sand and what looked like the bones of a horse. On the third day, I found the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. On the fourth day I found a crushed encampment of beetles, and a cave full of the most loathsome bats I had ever seen. So it went on day after day. In two weeks, I had covered the island, all while I had been making careful notes. And now I rested and spent my days drawing an exquisitely detailed map. I tacked this up above my palate. As night fell, and my blubber candles splattered. I lay back and considered my island home with Nereus Mac or schooner in sight, I could remain Maroon for years on end. My shelter might not last buffeted as it was by howling winds and freezing rain. I decided that the best place for me to live would be the cave. I declared war on the backs

gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, part two January 1911. I had been marooned on the island for just two days when I discovered the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. They were spattered with blood rolled up and jammed into a rotting wooden casket. I carried them back to my heart to examine them. There were about a dozen large sheets, rather frayed around the edges, but perfectly legible. The top left corner of each sheet had been stamped with an official device of the Bolivian administration showing an escutcheon ziggurat, the helmet of a conference. Restore the hand of God and abbreviations in neat metallic lettering. The signature of what I suppose to be a petty official had been scratched across each of the stamps in most ink. I could not understand why they were in such good condition. I tacked them up on the walls of my heart, where they rapidly grew so familiar that I no longer noticed them. I am the architect and I had more urgent matters to attend to. I have never forgiven myself for my stupidity. I've been warned not to roll my skiff into uncharted waters near the Antarctic Circle. But did I listen as Captain Peabody harangued me, You damned fool he shouted, his frosty whiskers twitching in the cold morning light. I turn for one last look at the ship as I guided my skiff into oblivion. I have not seen a human face since that day. Within minutes, I was overwhelmed by chilling poisonous mist. The hideous stench of crocus's made me sick to my stomach. I left for the ORS the foul was tampered with by my enemies, glob and muffin fell to pieces and the oars floated away out of reach. I drifted for hours. My anorak with it heard of reindeer hide, froze solid in casing me so that I was unable to move an inch, an orc or some such feathery in great shat on me repeatedly hovering above my head like a malign shade. I could not move to shoo it away. Eventually, mercifully, I passed out. When I came to I was surrounded by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. One of them with icicles forming on the brim of his hat was solicitously offering me a tin mug of brandy. I took a grateful swig, then noticed that his colleagues did not seem so friendly. They were glaring at me menacingly, one brandished a rather archaic halberd in the air and shouted horrifying words. All of a sudden, I became aware that I was aboard a huge shiny boat. Its sales billowing, it's dark, it's decked scrubbed clean, I turned to look again at the Mountie with the tin mug. For the first time I took in his features. It was much done by deadly enemy.

There are other hallucinations, other dreams. I shall not repeat them here. hours, days, perhaps weeks after I had set out in my skiff. I came at last to dry land again. When I woke to find myself sprawled on the beach of this island. Was it yet another Phantasm there were a number of ways to find out. I tried three of them. First I beat my head upon some boulders. This caused what seemed like real pain. Then I shoveled handfuls of coarse sand into my mouth and attempted to swallow. This caused me to read uncontrollably for some minutes. Almost satisfied, I conducted a third test. Taking from the breast pocket of my anorak a small file, I poured a miniscule quantity of a decoction of sandalwood, crease old gutta percha and pitch into the palm of my hand, held it aloft in the salty air, and mumbled incantations and gibberish sparks crackled in my hair shot up into the sky and brought tiny jewels of hail pinging down around me. Within seconds, they evaporated and were gone. But now I knew for certain that I was wide awake, no longer prey to visions and vapors. Being a resourceful sought, I managed to provide myself with adequate food, drink, warmth and shelter within a few hours, I began to search my temporary home and found the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. That was over a month ago. I found the remains of my skiff, crushed and broken swept up on some rocks on the northern coast, which seems to be the wildest. I have been working hard at my Almanac, and at keeping my beacons from it. Last night, as I hold dried and matted vegetation upon my northern beacon, I was attacked by a swarm of bats. Like swooped at me one after another, squealing horribly packing up my flesh. I fought them off with a burning stick, but I was shaken. I ran back to my heart and blocked up the doorway and Some of the holes in the walls with mulberry paste. Tonight, the bats are back, chewing their way frenziedly through the walls. I have on my rickety homemade desk a small bag of sulfur bombs with which I hope to fight them off. But timing will be crucial. I do not intend to perish.

cantik Bolivian architectural diagrams, the third and final part, October 1928. We docked at all 800 hours. bingo card when it frac and pin mouth were detailed to search the northern half of the island. While buke shame Dr. foot and myself took the South. I left wicket and bird Hall aboard the ship with strict instructions. I cannot remember what the instructions were. But they were strict. Make no mistake about that. The five of us who comprise the southern party set out it rapidly became apparent that the boulders and rocks on the island were giving off violent magnetic discharges. The tension was oppressive. We saw what looked like ball lightning far in the distance. I instructed buke to make us get in his little pad, but he complained that his pencil was blunt. Between us we could not muster a pencil sharpener. I was loath to have been returned to the ship alone to fetch the required implement. So I instructed Jabba to accompany him. I pressed on with Shem and Ferb the latter carefully scraping rock and mud samples into our canister. The path ahead was burned and scorched by what agency was not clear to us. At Oh 950 hours bird whole joined our party. She brought with her the ship's pencil sharpener. Apparently, Bukit suffered an attack of the seeds and was having a lie down in his cabin. I made a mental note to take him off later. I remember that clearly. Because at the very moment I thought it and mighty cravat opened in the ground directly in front of us. Ferb was swallowed up as the earth cracked apart. The rest of us staggered backwards. I'm glad that I have the presence of mind to tell Bert how to execute a quick sketch in big pad. She complained that she had not yet had a chance to sharpen the pencil, but I cut her short with a script of blood curdling ferocity. While is taught to do that sort of thing at officer school. Shin put down her accordion and made an impromptu bridge across the crevasse. Using all our footwear tied together. We clambered across and pressed on, although not before bird whole had insisted upon holding a commemorative service for the sadly departed thurb why I allowed it I do not know. I can be a sentimental own buzzard. While bird, how would you relating? We were joined by the northern party who had completed their investigations. Other than some extremely fascinating magnetic readings, all of the logical discoveries, amateur geological observations, and net full of maths and a worm count. They had nothing to report. I commanded frack or PIN mouth. I never could tell them apart, to return to the ship, but I cannot remember why. whichever one it was sent drabber back to us. I had suspected her of idling around like buke but she made haste to tell me that she had cast a McKenzie beam from the ship. I patted her on the head, not without some misgivings, as I do not think we had ever washed her hair. Last birdhouse stopped howling and we pressed on. We passed an enormous heap of skeletons, bad and human, according to Bengals, eagle eyed analysis, and various other manifestations of what Alabama calls last lac de l'amour. Have Jabba to thank for that quotation, Byrd Hall wanted to like delay further to give the two human skeletons of decent Christian burial. But I kept her on the temples and snarl that her. The ground over which we passed became rough and spiky, and we had to tread carefully in our socks. We would retrieve our top adventurers boots on our return trip, when we would be able to dismantle shins bridge, frac or PIN mouth handed around some custard balls for sustenance. Then, as we hacked our way through some overhanging foliage, we suddenly came face to face with the building.

Frank Key  20:45
It was smaller than we expected, like a scale model of a typical 19th century Bolivian civic Hall, and it had all the hallmarks of having been constructed out of bat droppings. I've removed my hat in all the others did likewise, except for Shem, who was not wearing a hat linnet, whose hat had snagged on the branch of a Dunstable tree a few hundred yards back, and bird Hall, whose hat had been glued to head for the duration of the expedition for some obscure religious purpose. I had interrogated her on this point, back at 10 Tara bin, I will publish the documents separately. Of course, we could not stand around like a bunch of clots all day, I jammed my hat back on my head and commanded my team to get to work. I was heartened to see that they set to it with such gusto. Within minutes, the instruments had been unpacked, the music stands set up, sheet music distributed, and everyone was at their post ready to queued up. The band was as follows bingo on bugle, Coggan, bassoon, shame on accordion drama on sackbut linnet on harmonium track or PIN mouth on cast the net and bird haul on handbells I myself conducted and played the Cornett we ran through a few bars of bring me your winding sheet own mother of mine, before settling down to the concert proper mackerels shrieked, but we drowned them out. We played my arrangements of the seven last words from the cross, Haydn, Salatin bureaucratic Saturday and the anti abolitionist riots Ives. for an encore we perform the routing version of the consumptive vest, Jabba arranged bird Hall. Then we packed up I ordered bird hall to make some detailed sketches of the building and beauty little pad and we also took measurements and poked about the place a bit, but not would soon be falling and there was no let up in the magnetic activity of this occurs in Ireland. The sooner we return to the ship, the better. The journey back passed without incident. We've collected our boots after recrossing shins bridge over the chasm. body had fallen so far, it was not visible. We did not tarry, wicket and pin mouth or frack were on duty on the bridge. They'd received warnings of volcanic activity over the radio. Before we set sail, I went into the cabin and told him I would Brook no further nonsense from him. I presented him with a rag and told him to go and polish everything on the ship. Back on deck, I found linnet mucking about with the McKenzie beam. I let it pass. I was a tired woman. We weighed anchor and headed home at last. Only later did I discover that I had left my kornet on the island. I cannot bear to go back there to retrieve it.

Frank Key  24:35
So yes, that fitted quite nicely into the show. And yeah, that was written in about 1994 probably. Which is frightening Lee 22 years ago, I think. Yeah. Anyway, that was and it was published in massacre magazine, which was a paperback magazine. edited by Roberta mock, and very good at work, there were five issues and it was very good. And have other people in there there was pieces by Max desharnais. Roberta self, Ed Baxter, I think, Peter Blake that if you find any copies of massacre on eBay or somewhere like that you should buy them and nearly time to go but before I do, I learned that the cathedral in Dubrovnik houses a holy relic of Christ nappy. And this inspired me unseasonally to write the first verse of a brand new Christmas Carol. So I know it's sunny. It's that blue month, September, not Christmas. But hair is the hair of the first is the first verse of my brand new Christmas Carol. And I did ask readers of the hooting yard blog to supply their own verses, which four or five people did. And I would I would read those two if I had time, but I don't think we've got time for the whole thing. But anyway, here's the first verse. Excuse me, have a brand new Christmas Carol. Inspired by the fact that Dubrovnik Cathedral has a holy relic of the nappy of Christ and goes like this. Baby Jesus, you make me happy. In Dubrovnik, they've got your nappy. So I recommend that you memorize that. And you can sing it next Christmas which is three months away three and a half months away. Yeah, so baby Jesus, you might be happy in Dubrovnik, they've got your nappy. And be interesting to know if there are like the dislike the True Cross. You know where there are so many scraps of Christ nappy that could be a gigantic piece of cloth. I don't know. If you have any information about rabbits that you'd like to share with hooting yard, email Mia, hooting dot yard at dream gmail.com you can go and visit the hunting yard website. Or you could just take a nap and come back and listen next week. Bye bye.

Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers. They wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
