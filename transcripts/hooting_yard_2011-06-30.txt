Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. Yes is your favorite time of the week, that golden half hour when he listened to my show, and last week, you may recall, we ended with the question. What is the lobsters tune when he is boiled? And I didn't have time to answer the question then. The question comes from the character his brand in death addressed book or the fools tragedy by Thomas Lovell beddoes. From 1829. Were in Act Three, scene three. His brand asks, What is the lobsters tune when he is boiled? He doesn't actually answer the question. And I invited readers to the hooting yard website to answer it. Only one person bothered to reply. No one interestingly suggested being boiled by the humanly, although that's possibly because that song as far as I recall, is about what is it? Thank you, silkworms. That's right. I've forgotten that. Thank you, john. No good because I'd forgotten that it was about silkworms, not lobsters. Someone else suggested rock lobster by the B 52. But anyway, the only reply that was actually received. The hooting yard website was from the indefatigable and a grammar test known only as AR. AR is often to be found lurking in the comments, hooting yard, providing us with useful anagrams. And this was as a response to being asked what is the lobsters tune when he is boiled? lobsters tune blunts stereo unsettles orb boson bosoms letter. Buttons reels.

Here is a quote from the naturalist in La Plata, by wh Hudson, published in 1892. I have never been worried with the wish or ambition to be a headhunter in the Diack sense. But on this one occasion, I did wish that it had been possible without violating any law or doing anything to a fellow creature, which I should not like done to myself, to have obtained possession of this man's head, with it set of unique and terrible teeth. When I coveted possession of that head, it was not because I thought that it might lead to any fresh discovery. A lower motive inspired the feeling, I wished for it only that I might bring it over the sea to drop it like a new Apple of discord in scribed, of course, to the most learned, but giving no locality and no particulars. Like Hudson, I wanted to gain possession of a man's head to carry it across the sea and drop it like an apple. And like Hudson, I wanted to do so without violating any laws, or doing harm to the man whose head it was. I was not so concerned about the head having a set of unique and terrible teeth. In fact, any head would do. But the logistics were an absolute nightmare, in spite of a first class education and the possession of an acute and incisive mind could not fathom how I might get hold of someone's head detach from the rest of their body without either breaking the law or doing them a mystery. When first this desire consume me, I did not bother myself with such niceties. I might be as an elegant and sophisticated cocktail party, and I would take someone aside, steer them to a corner where we would not be overheard and say, Can I have your head, I want to take it across the sea and drop it like an apple of discord. They will then follow a discussion in the course of which the familiar objections of criminal intent and physical harm would be raised. I blasted my way through these by wearing a fixed grin and waving my arms a lot, but the difficulties would not go away. I was unwilling to abandon the project entirely, however, so I sought advice from a Jesuit priest. The Jesuits are rightly famed for their casuistry, and I felt sure I would gain some useful tips. If anyone could pluck from the air, a method of gaining possession of a man's head legally and harmlessly father Ninian tongue lash was that man. I found him kneeling deep in prayer at the altar rail in the lady Chapel of a large and important Cathedral. I knelt down beside him and whispered a man's head father, how might I gain possession of one? He turned to me did something mysterious and significant with his rosary beads, and asked me to explain further, so I did so. Huh, he said, JJ critically when I had out loud when I had outlined my plans, it is a pretty conundrum to be sure. Now listen, more at the docks there is a Jesuit packet steamer the Ignatius of Loyola, it is Drew to set sail across the sea tomorrow night. Meet me at the dockside at 10 o'clock. I will have something for you. I thanked him and left him to his prayers. I spent the next 24 hours sorting out my affairs and packing a suitcase. at the appointed time. On my I made my way to the docks. Father tongue lash was already there, leaning against the wooden dock side, a pertinence smoking a high tace cigarette here, he said, handing me a bag. Take this with my blessing. It was a burlap bag and from its size and shape and heft. I knew at once that it contained a man's head. I was about to fire a volley of questions at the Jesuit but he held a nicotine stained finger to his lips and shushed me. You had better go aboard. He said the Ignatius Loyola is about to chug out. Thank you, Father. I said, How can I repay you? There is no need. He said. Just don't open the bag until you reach the land.

I promised I would obey as one should always obey a Jesuit and I boarded the steamer where I was shown to my cabin. I placed the bag carefully in a cubby then went back up on deck to wave goodbye to father tongue lash, and an odd assortment of dockyard, persons and seafarers, wives and Jesuits who had gathered to see us off. That was a Thursday evening a quarter of a century ago. We're still at sea climbing the oceans, the vast and illimitable oceans far from any land. The burlap bag is still there in the cubby of my cabin. I have not opened it.

Here is part one of a new series in which I dispense Free Radio legal advice to the unwashed masses. Our first topic is bonkers alibis. There is I'm told a body of opinion that reliable legal advice is best sought from qualified practitioners who devoted a number of years to study of the law. There is some merit in this view. Unfortunately, if I took it seriously, I wouldn't be in a position to dispense legal advice of any sort, and that would never do wooded. I like nothing better than to stand on street corners haranguing passers by with legal tips through a loud hailer if necessary, or even a Tannoy, whether those passers by are in need of the advice or not. After all, the day may come when they will need it, which come toward Tali Polly, Rincon vincom It's also worth pointing out that you may benefit from deep textual study of my legal tips, even if you're not a member of the unwashed masses. For example, if you're the sort of person who bathes occasionally and shuns human company, or loft in your ivory tower, such persons are still placed under arrest rightly or wrongly, particularly if detective Captain kargh pan is in a bad temper, as he so often is, when he has not roughed somebody up for a few hours. Why, only the other day I heard tell of a fellow an inhabitant of an Ivorian turret, given to preening upon his balcony spitting upon and hurling anathemas at the unwashed masses gathered below the foot of his turret with their pitchforks and their stink. Up the spiral staircase, lumbered karg pan and his toughs, and they bash this chap about him, dragged him off to the neck, where they bashed him about some more before charging him with several obscure crimes. Most of his thought had been removed from the statute book, such as leaning against his own mental peace and having an oddly shaped head. Of course, I knew these were still heinous acts of criminality, even though I have never studied the law. My knowledge comes from having memorized Dobson's pamphlet, how to fill your brain with arcane legal precepts through simple willpower and osmosis out of print. The Ivorian Terra Tia did not Alas, retain me as his legal advocate. And that's why he's now serving 20,000 years in singsing, or in the pointy town equivalent of singsing, which is called something like bing bang or ping pong or Whitworth. It's not to be confused with the thrilling sport of the same name, played with like little white balls and bats. The bats are not white, though they're fairly light and fairly little, when compared say to big bats like bludgeons the ones detective Captain kargh pan issues to his ruffins on the morning of an arrest. Nor are these the same bats that hang upside down in caves and flit and swoop and occasionally become entangled with the hair of screeching girlies in certain genres of film. I hope from what I've said so far that I have an enviable grasp of many matters, legal and otherwise, and therefore can almost always be relied upon when dispensing legal advice on the radio.

If you're suspected of having committed a crime, and are placed under arrest by law enforcement officers never provide an alibi, which is bonkers. This advice holds true whether you're innocent or guilty, or even in that gray area between the two like a cafo character. Let's assume for the purposes of our argument that you were indeed the shady limping figure I witnesses recalled seeing emerging from the pastry shop, clutching a handful of banknotes fresh from the open till over which is now slumped the grievously but not fatally wounded pastry shop proprietor. The pastry shop is a couple of miles north of Bolger Spinney in that little arcade known as the one time horn to flappers. You motored away in the sidecar of your accomplices getaway motorbike, and just 20 minutes later, you were sat in the snug of the cow and pins squandering your dishonestly obtained banknotes on bottles stout Excuse me.

When the police come to a rescue, whether it be that very day or weeks, months, or even years hence, do not say. At the time of the pastry shop, robbery officer, I was clambering up a mountainside in the Himalayas carrying a crate of exotic perfumes in preparation for a long overdue performance of scre our bins unfinished masterpiece mysterium. This is what we call a bonkers alibi, in that it is needlessly embroidered, easily disproved, and demonstrably untrue. Also, many Tavern goers will have seen you swilling stout in the Cowan pins within half an hour of the pastry shop robbery. And you could not have been in the Himalayan mountain range at that time, unless you had access to an exciting Space Age mode of transport, which does not yet exist. I know that we were all promised our own personal booster jet backpacks by about 1967. But it didn't happen. Equally, you should be aware of using a bonkers alibi, if you're accused of a crime of which you're wholly innocent. In these cases, telling the truth is by far the best option. Imagine you're sitting at home one day, feet up reading celebrity pap magazine to find out the latest doings of Stieg and folgende CEO and Agamemnon nabo, or perhaps other lesser known celebrities, ones with besmirched careers or no careers at all. Suddenly smashing their way through your window comes a heavily armed SWAT team descending on rope ladders from a sinister black helicopter. A hood is pulled over your head, and by the time it's removed, you're tied to a chair in a basement. You know not were being interrogated about your participation in the slaying of president john F. Kennedy in Dallas on the 22nd of November 1963. Now, remember, you were not there. At the time of the shooting almost half a century ago. You were paddling in the brackish water of fiendish inky black pond with other tops from the orphanage. So it would be completely bonkers for your alibi to be. I was standing in Dealey Plaza next to umbrella man or Babs Mary moves man. And then I stroll over to the white picket fence, where I shook the gunpowder stained handled bag man. And then I walked off towards the triple underpass and stemmons freeway to do a spot of birdwatching officer. Quick as a flash, your interrogators will arrange for a screening of the Zapruder footage, find out that you've been lying through your teeth and charged you with being part of a huge conspiracy and cover up. And always because you gave a bonkers alibi. And the next part of our series of legal advice is Madcap 11th hour plea bargains. So you can look forward to that.

Here is a variation on a theme by Jared Manley Hopkins. I caught this morning morning's minion with a combination of cutting in human patients and a big net weighted with baffles. I lay in white from before dawn behind an iris primed by a flask of vitamin enhanced squelch row from which I took regular slurps. Then, as morning broke as the kingdom of daylight dough fan came prancing into the room carrying a breakfast tray. I pounced, leaping out from behind the shouting and chucking the net over him. He dropped the tray and flailed and screeched dapple dong drawn, and I bashed him on the bonds with a brick and dragged him off to my lair. Elsewhere in the castle. Later in the morning, my father the king ran me to ground in a pantry, my heart in hiding scuffing cake. He was in a filthy temper, because of course, he had had no breakfast. That was why he came barging into the pantry. He was hoping to forage for toothsome creeks among the leftovers. sight of me However, his hunger was suppressed by a great eruption of rage unworthy principle He ruled preening milk SOP, rancor as valid. He continued with this tirade of insults for some time, his kingly boom growing louder and louder, so loud that the tins on the pantry shelves began to wobble and clutter. Whether it's because of my twisted spine, my slobbering or my pointy little head, my father harbors the conviction that I'm unfit to succeed him on the throne of his shabby kingdom. blind to my brute beauty and valor, an act of air pride plume he's been plotting to do away with me, enlisting the help of his minions, mornings, one and afternoons one and evenings one, Freeman, Hardy and Willis that he has no other air nor is likely to spawn one in his ancient dotage, does not seem to have occurred to him. I in turn, was plotting against the minions. Having nabbed Freeman firstlight I plan to entrap Hardy and Willis by similar means in the coming hours. Once I had the three of them safely imprisoned in my lair, I could move on to the next stage of the plot, though what that might be had not yet formed in my brain buzzing and pulsating and rather too big for my abnormally tiny head. For the time being, I simply stood there, twisted and hunched and scuffing cake as my father he imprecations upon me and the pantry and the tins on the shelves clatter been shook until one fell to the floor.

And as it hit the tiles, I saw the metal buckle and a fire broke from it, then a billion times told you lovelier, more dangerous than my father's temper. The blaze broke from the buckle 10 of compressed reconstituted snack time meat substitute was so surprising. It even shot my father up. He stopped shouting and looked at it with all and terror in his eyes. The fire quickly burned down to blue bleep beak embers. I kicked the child 10 across the pantry floor with my clubfoot and snapped my fingers. Ah, my dear. I set up a par. Four jaw yourself and gash gold. And I left the words hanging on hobbled out of the pantry stuffed with cake to waylay hardy afternoons minion as he came on cootie

Finally, this week, you've had some legal advice. And now I'm going to read you some instructions for a different well, different kind of advice. This is from the newly opened Frank key Academy of terpsichorean Erlang. Where you can learn to dance, like I don't know, like a combination of Nuray banana Pavlova, and any I don't know, I don't know enough dancers anyway. This this dance, here are the instructions, there are actually illustrations to go with it which you will have to imagine although you will be able to see them at the dabbler tomorrow. So if you go to the dabbler blog, which you may recall, tomorrow morning, you will see the illustrations, but for now you will have to imagine them. Figure one, let us call the dancers basil and dedeaux. They take up positions fake facing each other pointing with this sticks. Basil stick is cut from a sycamore tree and has traces of birdlife upon it guidos is fashioned from a bone from an ostrich the symbolism is clear. They maintain this stance staring fixedly at each other until I snap my fingers. finger to basil raises his stick upwards and forwards ghido essays a series of 12 jumps and hops and crashes his body as hard and as fast as possible into all four walls of the studio. If his hat falls off, he must replace it in a single fluid motion full of elegance and grace. He then takes off flying leap to return his starting point and raises his ostrich bone stick to crack against Basil's figure three. It is now Basil's turn to jump about and hurl himself at the walls, while guidos stands absolutely still with his stick above his head. Basil hood should flounce. However, rather ephemerally rather than trying to emulate kidoz more frenetic movements, he should nudge the walls rather than Buffett them and sashay back to his starting position with an air of insouciance. When he is once again opposite ghido he punches him in the throat. Finger for to the insistent clanging of bells dedeaux leans backwards, balancing his stick on his forehead. Basil takes hold of his neck tie but not tightly. They rotate a full 360 degrees pretending to be figurines and a decorative snow shaker. This takes consummate skill, and the difficulty of teaching this movement explains the supplementary fee tacked on to the standard cost of this lesson to be paid in cash. finger five having completed a full rotation, Basil adopter heroic pose while ghido splays himself on the floor as a snap of my fingers, Basil crumpled and ghido get up shimmies volts over basil, and in rapid succession essays or quadrille a Foxtrot, the twist and a mashed potato. Basil gets his feet. They throw their sticks out of an open window and clutter each other like lovers on a hilltop during a thunderstorm. A pop from the trombone brings the dance to an end. And if we had a trombone in the studio, apart from it would bring this week's edition of hooting out on the air to the end to an end. I've had a frog in my throat throughout the show. I do apologize for all the coughing. Next week I shall bring linctus with me. Yes back next week with more stuff and see you then bye bye
