If you can't hear me,

Frank Key  00:15
you're not listening to resonance.

Frank Key  00:37
Hello, this is resonance 104 point four f m, or resonance fm.com. And I'll try to sound less excitable. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And I was browsing in the basement of a dusty choked and unkempt secondhand bookshop. When I found on the floor, a slim pamphlet entitled A Guide to the care and feeding of the internal combustion monkey. The author's name was not given, but there was a picture of him below the title, a CAD, a CAD wearing a cravat with a Terry Thomas mustache and a glint in his eye. That glint I assumed that kads glint was the glimpse that led him to envisage and then to invent the internal combustion monkey. Why did he not wish to crow his name from the rooftops, or at least to print it on his pamphlet? I picked up the pamphlet and purchased it through happens and made it my life's work from that hour to find out exactly who this CAD was to give him a name to slot him into his deserved place in the history of this island glory. I began with the cravat in the picture on the pamphlet it was black and white, but I felt sure the real thing when tucked around the neck of the cat had been bursting with colors, but which colors I made multiple photocopies of the picture and spent two years armed with crayons and watercolors and state of the art pigments staining technology. Working out the color combinations, most likely to have been blazing the cravat of the CAD it was thirsty work and I drank a weld dry. This did not sit well with the wells owner of Florida bumpkin plagued with wit lows, who evicted me from my chalet and then to the well. And so I've roamed the hills, reduced to just a few crayons, but with my portfolio of photocopied hand colored CAD portraits in tact, tucked in a sacral slung over my good shoulder. That was up in the hills, the southern of a crab battered, and I made no bones about badgering her. One by one I waved in front of her the photocopies much as a conjurer might deploy a deck of playing cards for a magic trick, until at last she stopped me by pointing her finger decisively at the photocopy of the CAD, in which I had covered his cravat in swirling curlicues have Bay's green and fire and red and Lee Harvey Oswald beige with a few subtle tints of Indigo Cerise. puce chartreuse, Mo, Mo, and more most of that is his cravat, cried the craft matters. And who is or was he? I asked. eyes narrowed, her lips puckered. Her dog sitting at her feet snarl. I felt a sudden mortification of the bowels. He was an unspeakable CAD, she cried, and she had her dog chase me out of the salon, and further up into the hills where the air was thin, and the promontory is dizzying. I have left my satchel and crayons and schrieffer photocopies at the salon, but clutched in my good hand, the only photocopy that mattered, the one with the accurate rendition of the color scheme of the cravat sported by the CAD, and I knew now what I had not known before, that his name was unspeakable. I remained in the hills for several years living on rainwater and birds fell with well aimed pebbles slowly, gradually, I came to understand that if the name of the CAD was unspeakable, then it had never been spoken, that nobody knew what it was leading to the inescapable conclusion that vast unknown it could not be written down, which is why it did not appear printed in big, bold black letters. On the cover of the pamphlet the cat had written about the care and feeding of the internal combustion monkey.

Frank Key  05:31
And so I came down from the hills and adopted a new life as a bar g on unimportant canal, and I sprouted a Terry Thomas moustache. And yes, yes, I too, wore a cravat of Bayes green and fire and red and Lee Harvey Oswald beige, with a few subtle tint of Indigo Cerise, puce shower throws mode, mode and more mode. And whenever I was asked my name by other boundaries, or by say canalside, picnic persons, I shut my mouth and kept it shut, and said nothing.

Frank Key  06:32
As you may recall a couple of weeks ago, on the show, we had a slight sheduled Next up because I was all ready to do my show when also, thinking it was her turn to do her show was Miss blossom Partridge, with Miss blossom partridges knitting half hour. And since that happened, thousands of letters have poured in both the resonance and two hooting yards own office. And, well, here's a typical letter, typical of the many thousands received. Dear Mr. Key, much as I enjoy your program, I couldn't help thinking that the half hour would be much better spent listening to miss blossom Partridge, and her knitting tips for half an hour. And so I suppose by popular demand, this week, we've got Miss blossom Partridge back, and she's just going to spend a little bit of time giving you a knitting tip or perhaps more than one I don't know. Over to you miss blossom Partridge.

Unknown Speaker  07:43
Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Key, That's very kind of you. Mr. Kay assures me that I have had thousands of letters, and that I have more than a listener, but I'm not convinced of this. So my knitting tip today is actually for people who haven't met for a while or for people who are trying to buy a gift for another because let's be honest, tis the season I'm currently working on and and ironically, Mr. Key will love this. It's it's a hot that is in a shade that I think is not dissimilar to Lee Harvey Oswald beige. The hat pattern is the antler hat pattern. And it's one of the very straightforward patterns that comes from tin can knits. If you don't know tin can knits there, tin can knits calm or.co.uk, I believe. And they're a very sort of new knitter friendly. Couple of ladies. transatlantic, one of them lives in Canada, the other lives in Scotland. And together, they come up with wonderful designs for families and people who are trying to get back into knitting. So great tip there. If you're if you're trying to take up knitting again after several years. The other thing I was going to suggest is if you're wanting to get a gift for another the absolute best thing is to get them a gift certificate or voucher. I know some people find that impersonal, but actually it's the best thing. If you're in London, I'd suggest loop knitting which is very well known knitting store and it has some beautiful things. Or you could also try it in the east part of London, wild and woolly or knit with attitude. All of these are real favorites if Miss blas and Partridge and Google them and you'll find them very quickly.

Frank Key  09:40
Could I ask you a question? Absolutely wouldn't the best gift for a knitter be a sheep?

Unknown Speaker  09:50
It depends on the sheet. well behaved of well bad well behaved wouldn't,

Frank Key  09:56
wouldn't appreciate a well behaved sheet.

Unknown Speaker  10:01
Yeah, well gas provided to provide it

Frank Key  10:04
a belligerent angle.

Unknown Speaker  10:10
Maybe not so much, but

Frank Key  10:12
yeah, a recalcitrant Merino

Unknown Speaker  10:17
preening llama. Yes, absolutely, absolutely. But maybe maybe leave that till you know your nature a little bit better.

Frank Key  10:25
Okay. All right. Well thank you Miss blossom Partridge, and we might have time for another tip later in the show. But at this point, I'd like to read a story to you called village of the trees graters. As I made my way through the world, along lines and pathways lined by large laburnum and pine, I came up last to the village of the cheese graters. Here, I thought, is somewhere I can lay my hat. My hat is not a cheese hat. It will not be grated. And it was not, but nor was it admired as I felt sure it would be. No villager came up to me to say, cor Blimey, what a splendid tip for you've got there a top your head mine here. Rather, they seem to sullen people. Jolly and horse on sullen, sullen. In the village square I sat to observe their ways. I jotted no notes in my jotting pad. It struck me and forcibly forcibly that they seem to grate more marzipan than trees. The air was scented with almonds. Theirs was a sullen grating. There were many gratings to punctuating the paving slabs of the path criss crossing the square, metal grating gleamed in the sunlight in lattice patterns of stupendous complexity, like the most delicate of lace work. What lay beneath those gratings I wondered, drains and sewers, drains and sewers, came the reply whispered on the breeze. Do not scarf when I suggest I was spoken to by the wind by the stirrings of the arm and scented air. That is how it is in the village of the cheese graters that salad place where cheese comes cheap and marzipan cheaper. It was a tiny village and when I left the square I was soon enough out in open country. Now there was no wind to speak of, or to speak to me. Always still and silent. I saw a bird in the sky. But I know nothing of Ornithology. I passed on my splendid tip for a top my head towards another village.

Frank Key  13:32
Apparently, I learned recently that there is actually another radio station other than resonance FM was kind of a great surprise to me. I think I accidentally tuned into it one day. And it's called BBC Radio for whatever that means. And anyway, in the mornings, that quarters at No, two minutes to six in the morning. They have a show called tweet of the day, which for someone as an owner for logically aware as me is obviously requires listening. But the other day after listening to tweet of the day, which is nothing to do with that social media. Nick makary it's it's about birdsong. But anyway, the other day after listening to it, I was compelled to write a letter to the BBC Radio four. And this is what I wrote. Dear BBC Radio four. I am a keen and regular listener to tweet of the day, your two minute program devoted to birds and birds on broadcast each weekday morning at the ungodly hour of 558. I have grown used to beginning excuse me I have grown used to beginning my day, having my ears delighted by the various trills, chirps, chirrups calls, squawks, tweets, et cetera, et cetera, of our avian pals. Thus I was mightily disconcerted this morning to hear not a bird but a bat. This was towards the end of October. I charged the unpaid interns of the hooting yard ornithological, Research Bureau, with the task of checking these things for me, and the crippled Yes, sprightly orphans toiling away in the cellar reported back to sweet but as I suspected, a bat is not a bird. Unless you have renamed the series, airborne mammalian squeak of the day. This is simply unfathomable. Please ensure that you will editor studies carefully the diagram of a bird shown on the hooting yard website to avoid committing the same blunder in the future. You will peevishly Frank key. And I actually received a reply from the BBC from BBC Radio four, which read as follows. Dear Mr. Key, thank you for your peevish complaint. recent development the BBC have clearly escaped your notice. You may know that the inaugural Director General of the corporation was a God fearing scotchman of great rectitude Lord wreath. Following a conference held in a grim granite chapel perched on a windswept promontory. The senior management vowed to jettison all that left the politically correct Gramsci and Marxist poppycock and return the BBC to stern drawed Ruthie and values informed by Christian ethics. Henceforth, Christ is our guide, and the Bible is His Word. And it is abundantly clear from the Bible, that the bat is a bird. I refer you to Leviticus, chapter 11, verses 13 to 19. and resolve as we shall have an abomination among the fouls, they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination, the eagle, and the Aussie frayed and the ospreay. And the vulture and the kite after his kind, every Raven after his kind of the owl, and the Nighthawk, and the cookoo and the hawk after his kind, another little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, and the swan, and the Pelican, and the Gaia, Eagle, and the stork, the Heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. I trust this clarifies the matter and that you will repent of your sins. May the Lord bless you and keep you or smite you and chastise you as is as in his infinite wisdom he sees fit yours in Christ, the rave, Ninian tongue rash, BBC ornithology and theology inquisitive general.

Frank Key  18:50
Interestingly, that quotation from Leviticus is one of the three passages in the Bible where a cormorant is mentioned. Perhaps I think I've probably mentioned that before, we may even have an entire show dedicated to but biblical cormorants if we haven't, we will have soon. Where were we? And once upon a time, Dobson decided to write a pamphlet on the subject of lint. Last begins Ted cacs mammoth new book, the lint pamphlet, and enduring mystery is the latest in a series of mammoth books, each one devoted to a single work by Dobson including those which the 20th century's Titanic pamphleteer, abandoned or planned but never wrote, or woodmere fugitive throbs within his cranium. By the time my work is done, announced Ted Kak at a press conference held at the end of a dilapidated seaside pier buffet By schools earlier this week, the number of words I will have devoted to Dobson's works will dwarf the number of words in all those works put together, however you add them up. Quite what he meant by this last phrase is unclear, as there is only one way to add things up as most of us understand the process. Granted, we're not all students of advanced mathematics, but then nor is Ted CAC, his profile on the online network, my boast list several qualifications from several dubious or unimportant institutions, most of which appear to be in frankly, absurd fields such as hermeneutic. ornithology or an unapplied faffing. As a Dobson is, however, Ted Kak is peerless once the headed on farm Terry bill of Dobson studies. As the years have passed, his head has become far less hot. Indeed. Last time its temperature was measured. His head proved to be so cold, various medics pronounced him clinically dead. Tag CAC shot the mall by springing up from his head temperature measuring bed, cutting two or three capers around the room allied James Boswell of a morning dancing either a quadrille or a Greg gavotte depending from what angle you viewed it, and singing with unnerving boisterousness the chorus from more than a feeling by Boston scholtz 1976 I'm afraid I must interrupt this riveting narrative. The console is beeping with an incoming query. Let me decode it.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
If Ted CAC is paralysed, how do you explain his press conference taking place on appear? I'll be at a dilapidated one

Frank Key  22:10
bad question is more sensible than it seems much much more sensible, so sensible. It takes my breath away. Moroder Whitlock 1986. Performed by Berlin, Berlin ought not be confused with Irving Berlin. The former was an American New Wave band formed in Orange County, home of Richard M. Nixon in 1979. The latter born Israel bilin wrote the kinds of songs which would knock anything written by Berlin the band into a cocked hat. My breath having been taken away, unable to answer the question right now, but can only pant and weeds as I struggled to remain conscious. You may be familiar with such a struggle, for example, when listening to hooting guard on the air broadcasts of which have been known to allow even the most alert listeners into a deep and profound sleep, or at least a catnap. I should point out here that inquiry such as the one about peerless Ted Kak on appear, are always welcome. Even if I do not always, oh, wait, here's another one beeping on the console already.

Unknown Speaker  23:29
I could not help noticing that you have mentioned to pop music combos today, both of which take their names from cities beginning with the letter B. That is Boston and Berlin. Are there any other groups with similar nomenclature? For example, Bridlington, Basingstoke, Biggleswade, Bognor, Regis, Broadstairs, Buckley, Salterton, or Bungie to list only a few towns in England.

Frank Key  24:02
If anything, that's an even more sensible question, and one I would be prepared to answer here and now where my knowledge of pop music combos more exhaustive than it is. But for heaven's sake, I meant to be talking about lint. Perhaps the most startling revelation of my mammoth new book said Ted Kak at that press conference held at the end of a dilapidated seaside Pier. buffeted by schools earlier this week, is that Dobson seem to be wholly ignorant about his proposed subject matter. This is not half as startling as Ted Kak thinks it is. It was the out of print pamphlet is common practice to write endless screed on topics of which he knew nothing whatsoever. The word for this is purple locution and Dobson was a master of it. Sometimes he'd like to pretend He was following the dictum that the best way to learn about something is to write a book about it. But this is rather belied by the resulting out of print pamphlet, which rarely tell us much about anything except the baffling innards of the author's brain. startling or not, however, Ted Kak painter comparing picture of Dobson and marigold to breakfast on the morning, when the Lynx spark was lit. The couple were tucking into bowls of reconstituted Partridge livers in a mustard and milk of magnesia through idea when the pamphleteer suddenly banged his spoon against his forehead and burst into unnervingly boisterous song. I want to know what lint is. I want you to show me marigold my sweet. I want to feel what a lint is. I know you can show me he sang to the tune of I want to know what love is. Jones 1984 performed by foreigner. Interestingly, all the members of the group actually were foreigners, except for those periods when they were present in their home countries. I think you would better write a pamphlet on the subject. Dobson said marigold to the enduring mystery of Ted tack subtitle is that Dobson never did.

Frank Key  26:44
That's the end of this week's show, I'm afraid but we've just got time for another quick knitting tip from Miss blossom Partridge star of Miss blossom pottery is missing half hour, which is now Miss blossom partridges knitting 30 seconds or a minute or so. Many thanks to her and john for engineering it. I'll be back next week. Take it away. Miss blossom Partridge.

Unknown Speaker  27:12
Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Kay. Let's go for a knitting tip for more advanced knitters. People who are contemplating doing some color work. One of the things that's often talked about when you're doing color work is color dominance. And that's the color that pops out from the color work. If you're doing stranded colorwork. The way to achieve that is to make sure that the color you want to be dominant to have its floats carried below the other, the other yarn and the other stitches. So if you are the sort of person who does color work to hand it, make sure you hold the color you want to be dominant in your left hand and hold the background color in your right. And that's it for me. Good night.
