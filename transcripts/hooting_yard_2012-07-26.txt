This is hooting out on the air. And my name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for about 28 minutes. So sit back, fall asleep and read the words just oozing through your ears into your unconscious state the other the other day I complained that London's whopping new whopping great skyscraper, the shard, which is very close to the resonance studios from where I speak, is insufficiently pointy. I stand by those words. It's not a point here as it ought to be, nor I understand as it was originally intended to be. I think it was meant to taper up to a single pointed tip. Instead, it fizzles out in a pair of premature semi pointy bit, which has Marina Oregon noted in the comments on the hooting yard website look quote, like a slightly worn frayed paintbrush that needs a lick from quote. And yet, how pointy it could have been. The entire design cries out for it to continue up and up way past that pair of disappointing tips to a single pointy termination. So pointy indeed, that it's top ought to be invisible, like the pointy thing and flann O'Brien's the third policeman. It's many years since I read that magnificent novel. So I cannot recall the details. But I remember that there's a pointy thing so pointy that its actual tip is far far beyond its physical tip as seen by the unaided eye. The shard should have been as pointy as that. I don't want to harp on about this. Well, I do. And I will. But the building could be a hell of a lot point here then it's turned out, an opportunity was missed. To see properly pointed buildings of course, one need go no further than pointing town. Now there's a place where the architects and builders do not fight shy of true pointedness there's not an edifice in pointy town that is not pointy, certainly pointillism. The shard not just buildings, but statues, st appurtenances people's hat, even the very landscape itself, all as pointy ears can be. For those keen on pointing us, it's very heaven. I'm not sure if Pevsner ever went to pointy town. But had he done so he would have been in raptures at the sheer profusion of pointy bits. If that is he was pointing minded, which I'm equally unsure whether he was or not, let's say merely that he damn well ought to have been. Pevsner after all, is a curiously pointing name, at least one suggestive of pointing us in comparison to a name like, I don't know starlin for example, in spite of its meaning of steel, or steely, which might evoke pointedness Starling has a softer, more rounded qualities and Pevsner to my ear. And starving himself was of course, Paki, of which more later

Frank Key  03:48
there are buildings in pointy town taller, and needless to say, point here than the shard and this led to the good burgers of the town banning hot air balloons from floating through the blue blue skies above. It was feared, not without good reason that there was an unacceptable risk of a hot air balloon colliding with the exceedingly pointy tip of a pointy town building and suffering a puncture. Imagine the loss of life and the subsequent cries of distress from the hot air ballooning community, yet hardly best thinking about it was much wiser of the burgers merely to outlaw the practice of hot air ballooning. In this they followed the Mughal Tony ins so for different reasons. You may recall that the Mughal Tony ins a religious sect formed in the ferment of 17th century London, which survived until the death of the last Mughal Tony and Philip Noakes in 1979 banned hot air ballooning on theological grounds, believing as they did that God lived in a heaven that was located precisely six miles above the Earth. The muzzle Tony ins fear that an airborne hot air balloon would crash into the sky, a solid band separating Earth from heaven. cynics and nitpickers might argue that their band was based rather on the suspicion that a hot air balloon rising happily into the air would actually disprove their contention about the nature of the cosmos. And bring not the balloon, but their entire theology crashing down around there is that may be a valid point, but one we will perhaps to decline from making this week. Last week, for example, would have been a better time, the Thursday the 19th of July with the Mughal Tony and little holiday. Those of us who are not Mughal tidy ins can celebrate too by singing the praises of pointy town and it's unrivaled pointedness and one way we might count and one way we might celebrate is by doing our utmost to eradicate those parts of pointy town which are parked. Yes, awful as it may be. It must be admitted that there are patches of pointy town that a Paki not as pitted with pox as the tricks of Uncle Joe Stalin, which were deeply and in a radical pocked I think following about of smallpox during his Georgian childhood, but I may be wrong. I'm not wrong about the pox justice I'm not wrong about the supreme pointedness of most of pointing down justice I'm not wrong about the insufficient pointing as of the shard most of waiting written for my inserted a parenthesis to cleave as close to the truth is I could fail Let me repeat, there are Paki parts of pointy town, how they got there as a mystery. Some say the whole place used to be pocked in ancient times, or pre ancient times, when the planet was young. Over the centuries, those who lived there and they're about made it their business to obliterate the cockiness, which is why they struggled so heroically to create the point is place imaginable. By almost succeeded for there is no wear point here, at least nowhere that has yet been discovered. If you've seen a point here place in pointy town, you will almost certainly hallucinating Yeah, here and there pox to remain grim reminders of a time when pointy town was less pointy than it is now. civic pride is strong enough to ensure that one by one, the pox is spotted and destroyed. This is usually done by putting something pointy in place of the pox. easily done, you might say. So why make a song and dance about it? To which the responses that airily and uncannily new bits of POC Enos appear, dotted here and they're about pointy town, where before there was only pointing us it is as if the pox are at war with the point and can never be utterly defeated. That is why every point in town and those of us who support them fight daily to create evermore pointy bits and to eradicate the pox. of one thing you can be sure if a copy of the shard is built in pointy town, it will taper at its top to a properly pointy tip.

Frank Key  09:18
I am often accosted in the streets by wild eyed maniacs who block my path and dragged me on the shoulder with bony fingers, demanding to be told how I arrived each day as a topic to write about. As you know, I've been writing this year, a daily si of about 1000 words that hooting yard and so I have to come up with something every day. But I as I'm reluctant to divulge the true nature of the hooting yard creative process. I usually babble sufficient nonsense to satisfy my assailant who allows me on my way this morning However, on my way back from a circuit of nameless pond, I felt curiously impelled to tell the truth. Let me recount the dialogue verbatim, or as verbatim as I can recall it. To give you a glimpse into the travails of your favorite panelists Scribbler. In what follows the part of the wild eyed maniac is played by poppy Nisbett, who has joined me in the studio specially, so many thanks to Poppy. So there I was, I was walking along singing to myself. Delicate delicate data. It's the final countdown.

Unknown Speaker  10:50
Mr. Key?

Frank Key  10:52
Yes, my good woman. How may I be of assistance on this rain drenched morn?

Unknown Speaker  10:58
What are you going to write about today? And how did you decide upon the topic? Answer me that.

Frank Key  11:05
You mean? Answer me those.

Unknown Speaker  11:08
Quit stalling, Buster and spill the beans.

Frank Key  11:12
Have you been reading decades old American Pulp Fiction per child?

Unknown Speaker  11:16
Of course not. Like any sensible, wild eyed maniac. I read only the dispatches from hooting yar to the exclusion of all else.

Frank Key  11:26
very astute, if I may say so. You may.

Unknown Speaker  11:29
But now answer my question. I mean questions.

Frank Key  11:35
Although I'm usually reluctant to divulge of the true nature of the hooting yard creative process. For some inexplicable reason, I feel impelled to tell you how I arrived at today's topic. Be warned, however, that my reply is only applicable to this particular day. In the final week of July in the year of our Lord, mm x i,

Unknown Speaker  12:04
Arby's around

Frank Key  12:06
in spite of the song I chose to be singing when you accosted me, I am as you are probably well aware, curiously obsessed with Jethro Tull. God knows why. That being the case, my very first thought on waking, before I even plunged my head into a pail of icy water was of the early albums of Jethro Tull and perhaps, and how perhaps, Ian Anderson, could be said to have lost his Mojo, circa 1974. Some would say even earlier, perhaps in 1972, whichever date one chooses, I suspect there is general agreement that the band's best work, or the work for which it will be remembered, yay onto every generation appears on those first few releases. Of those however, the debut album, this was 1968 is sometimes overlooked, possibly because of the strong blues influence, and the presence of Mick Abraham's as a creative rival to Anderson. Two things which are of course, connected. In that sense, it's a typical of early towel, not having listened to it for a long, long time. I tried to recall some of the songs, and the one that jumped to the surface of my brain was beggar's farm. It was but a short step from there to making the decision to write about a beggar's farm today. Not I hasten to add to write about the song, but instead to appropriate the title and write some majestic sweeping paragraphs about a farm populated entirely by beggars.

Unknown Speaker  13:49
Gosh,

Frank Key  13:51
before I could concentrate on the ineffable glory of my prose, however, I found myself fretting away about the apostrophe in beggars.

Unknown Speaker  14:03
This is absolutely fascinating. And it reminds me why you are surely the greatest living writer of English prose apart from Jeanette Winterson.

Frank Key  14:13
You see, Anderson and Abraham says co writers seem to have had just one beggar in mind, placing the apostrophe between the R and the s. But my farm, the one gradually taking shape in my head, populated by beggars and indigents and traps and drunks and wretches would demand the apostrophe after the s to reflect the plurality plurality of beggars. Thus, I was in a quandary Should I entitle the essay on beggars farm with the apostrophe between the R and the s to reflect it funds at origo or on beggers farm with the apostrophe after the s to more accurately signal To the panting and overexcited reader what to expect.

Unknown Speaker  15:05
How on earth did you know that we hooting yard readers pant with over excitement as our Windows Vista computer screens are lit up each day by your latest scribblings.

Frank Key  15:17
I have my spies. But tell me what would you advise regarding the placement of that pesky apostrophe?

Unknown Speaker  15:25
Let's uh, check. See one. Make no mistake.

Frank Key  15:29
I think it's important you say that I give credit to the monopod flautist, and to the founder of blood when pig the idea of the beggar's farm is theirs and theirs alone and I'm merely plotting in their footsteps, or in Ian Anderson's case, footstep. I've always assumed he got from place to place by hopping, at least while playing the flute.

Unknown Speaker  15:53
I have heard that is indeed the case.

Frank Key  15:56
At the same time, I don't wish to wish my title to be grammatically incorrect, nor to lead the panting and overexcited readers into thinking they will be reading about a farm with only a single beggar in situ. I envisage dozens if not hundreds of beggars, sprawled or lolloping about the farm, surrounded by rusty abandoned farm implements and machinery, growing nothing on fields reduced to scrub and Gautham Bracken rattling their tin cups at passers by moaning and cleaning and displaying a variety of unsightly saws and scars and stumps resulting from the amputation of one or more limbs. If the second is shortly after a war, several of the beggars may have been gassed in the trenches. Oh, I can't wait to read it. But wait, you shower until I'm able to work out where to put the damn the apostrophe.

Unknown Speaker  16:54
Oh, look. Up there in the sky. There is a flock of swooping feathered beings with wings.

Frank Key  17:01
They are called birds. And so we went our separate ways the wild eyed maniac and I and I returned to my escrow trois to struggle with an apostrophe placement crisis.

Frank Key  17:48
Benny, thanks so poppy Nisbett there I forgot all about beggars far by Jethro Tull, and I thought of a different song to write about. magazine's 1978 song The light pours out of me, is a splendid example of a lyric in which the singer claims to have light pouring out of him. A couple of others that springs to mind are see me in it a remarkable of fulgens by periodical and gadget is, I bear a striking resemblance to a switched on incandescent light bulb. Neither of these had the success of magazines foray into the genre, perhaps with good reason. By any measure magazine song is both musically and lyrically superior. Those of us who've calculated the blots one unit from the second handbook lavender series, arrived at 14.764 magazine 8.354 periodical and a lamentable two point naught six for gathered here. It's important to stress that botsman is an exact science, so there's no room for maneuver. In interviews, periodicals, singer and lyricist Hara would scream jaw has always insisted that see me emit a remarkable fulgens paints a far more vivid picture of light pouring out of himself than Howard devoted his effort. But the botsman units do not lie. And one listen to the song after all these years serve to serves to remind us why it was roundly ignored upon release. The music is very plinky plunky This is not always a bad thing, of course, and some clunky clunky records have been chart hit, or at the very least acceptable fillers album tracks. That said clinky clunkiness is a difficult art to master, as Dobson proved conclusively in his majestic pamphlet, the difficulty of Mastering the Art of plinky clunky musical composition with a mezzotint of chiasm Dave out of print. Dobson argues that the balance of plinks and plunks is critical. And it's this balance I think, or the lack of it that undermines the periodical piece. At times, it's all plinky. at others all plunky and the pinks and the plonk never seem to coalesce into plinky Plumpy'Nut proper challenged on this score in a notorious interview by Russell hearty Hara would scrim draw babbled some politics about Ravel Baxter Hughton Scriabin, before bursting into tears, tearing the microphone from his lapel, running out of the studio and flinging himself into the canal, from which he was rescued by screaming teenagers who had been camped outside the television studio, mistaking the periodical front man for Gilberto Sullivan, to whom He bore a passing resemblance from a certain angle in a certain light on certain days of the week. It's not just the flawed, clunky clunkiness of the music, however, but the lyrics to which fail to match up to magazines song fatally scrimshaw seems to have taken as his guide that see me Feel me touch me twaddle from the who's Tommy. Indeed, when first he caterwauling the words see me and pauses. We are startled to think we're listening to Roger Daltrey himself. scrim draw then tries to jam the word, a meta remarkable it Falcons into the exact same melody, adulteries. Feel me touch me. Try it yourself, and you will appreciate that only a madcap could ever think it would be something teenyboppers would want to hear more than once. With the plinks and plunks accompanying the word. It really is the most god awful racket. Well, perhaps not the most. That accolade if accolade it is must be reserved for gadgeteers. I bear a striking resemblance to a switched on in Candice and to light bulb.

Frank Key  22:29
The title suggests a novelty record, or perhaps one of those disarmingly, naive, amateurish post punk ditties, which is to amuse us all those years ago. In fact, it's the most god awful racket and determinately So, a 20 minute barrage of improvised din, produced by amplified cheese graters, coathangers, bags of cement, hammers and nails and screwdrivers and funnels and Hooters and the Lord knows what else accompanying this cacophony gadget is singer and lyricist Harold starlin. Alternately shrieked whispers declaims on matters, or Ryan so foolish, it beggars belief. I will not try your patience by reproducing the whole thing. But here is a sample I bear a striking resemblance to a switched on in Canvas and light bulb. Yeah, my light bulb shaped head is entirely bald, because this morning I shaved off all my hair. I might do the whole thing again later. Take it away. Amplified cheese grater, followed by the solo. Harold Starling took his amplified cheese grater with him when he made an appearance on Russell hearty plus. A week after Harewood, scrim Joe had fled the studio. A more convincing interviewee than the periodical singer. Starling, charmed hearty with a series of verbal sallys that seemed incongruous coming from the mouth of such an idiotic lyricist. He demonstrated wit Verve airy addiction and a kind of gumption, all in the space of five minutes. hearty was so bowled over. He asked if he could have a go with the cheese grater. fiddling about with the attached wiring just before passing it to the track show host Harold Starling got his sockets mixed up and managed to electrocute himself. He survived the accident, but was never quite the same. He certainly lost all trace of wit, Verve airy addiction and the kind of gumption he disbanded gadgeteer and formed a new group adopting a new pseudonym, and went on to a huge international success followed by lute playing as far as I'm aware He still goes under the same pseudonym, which I think is string or something like that. There are several other songs in which the singer claims have light pouring out of him, but they're quite difficult to track down. Dobson wrote a pamphlet about his own tireless efforts to do just that. To which he gave the title lead kindly light to bald men wearing speck out of print. If ever you stumble upon a copy in a second hand pamphlet shop, be very very careful. marigold Chu devised a special cover for the pamphlet, which, when opened, revealed a blinding incandescent light, not unlike that which shines forth from the mysterious case in kiss me deadly. Robert Aldrich 1955 starring Ralph Meeker and Cloris Leachman.

Frank Key  26:33
That's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. Once again, my thanks to poppy nism Nesbitt for spectacularly convincing performance as a wild eyed maniac. One legal note the the Harold starvin, who later became known as string is not related in any way to Trudy stylers husband. How could he be with lyrics? I'm going to give you a brief a brief encore now as the opening four lines of I bear a striking resemblance to a switched on incandescent light bulb to end this week show, so when I've done this, that'll be the end and I'll see you next week. I bear a striking resemblance to a switched on in Canvas and light bulb. Yeah. My light bulb shaped head is entirely bald because this morning I shaved off all my hair. I might do the whole thing again later. Take it away. Amplified keys greater bye bye
