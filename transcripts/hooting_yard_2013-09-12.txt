Angelo it came to pass that it was resonance 104 point four FM with hooting yard on the air live from London with me Frank key. And interestingly enough, on today's show, I just arrived. And there's an elephant in the room is pushing the envelope and thinking outside the box. And what it's thinking about it's not rocket science. Elephants are among the more intelligent members of the animal kingdom. But their brains cannot cope with the complexities of rocket science. it's more likely that the elephant is thinking about food, and when next, it might find some vitamin Rich leafage to manage. Not that it would have any concept of vitamins, any more than a rocket science. So anyway, there is this elephant in the room with an envelope and the box. It must be a reasonably big room for an elephant to fit into it. And one, moreover, with a large door, subject sufficient in height and breath to allow the passage through it have a great big galumphing element, the lobby of an important hotel would fit the bill. Somebody has placed in the lobby, an envelope and a box. They may have been put there before the arrival of the elephant or after, it doesn't matter for Christ's sake. With regard to the envelope, it's a pretty straightforward matter that the elephant has chosen to push it across the floor by exercising its trunk. Whether or not the envelope is sealed or open, whether it's empty or contained some document or legal writ, a love letter, a coupon snip from a magazine, the elephant neither knows nor cares, nor the way we might surmise that it's pushing the envelope because that's something for it to do to keep it occupied. Or because the presence of the envelope on the floor of the lobby is an irritant to the elephant, which would prefer an unsullied space in which to plod about that the elephant is thinking outside the box is blindingly obvious. Unless it's an enormous box the elephant is not going to fit inside it is it. Even if the box is big enough to receive an elephant, it would have to be an elephant of red daintiness to succeed in clambering into the box without crushing it in the process. It is after all a cardboard box. We can assume that not only is the elephant thinking outside the box, it's ignoring it, at least for the time being. While it's busy itself, pushing the envelope across the floor with its trunk and thinking about food. Everything might change of course when the elephant pushes the envelope as far as the wind is caught, and can push it no further. It's anybody's guess what will happen next.

I could speak to you today Matt pine and plain and Sycamore and large but instead I wish to focus your attention upon ash and box and Elm and you ash box Elm you four trees in alphabetical order. It's not necessarily the best order in which to arrange trees. Certainly not if one were planting an orchard. But for our present purposes, we'll do it we'll do. Each is a three letter word for a tree. Each has a trunk and leaf edge, and of course roots. These are not the roots of which Alex Haley wrote. But now the twisting roots which anchor the actual the box or the LM or the you in place, wherever that place may be. It's the presence of roots under the tree submerged in the muck, that account for your inability to push the tree over with one mighty heave. So when we consider the ash and the box and the Elm and the you, we must keep in the forefront of our minds that they are rooted, anchored, not easily toppled. This helps us to tell them apart from top level things, which are countless. There are more things in the world that topple over than do not. I would have you take a few moments to think about that. You For example, this sort of thing that could be toppled. while standing there lost in thought. You might be knocked over by a ferociously high wind shoved by a shovel or suffer from a sudden and catastrophic weakness at the knees. In certain circumstances, the same is indeed true of ash and box and element you. High winds have toppled trees, shovels armed with chainsaws have toppled them. Even weakness in a tree trunk caused by blight or disease can topple a tree. The point I'm making is that it's much easier to topple you than it is to topple a tree. Unlike a tree, you are not rooted to the ground, at least not in your natural state. By the way, do not confuse the homophones you Why are you and you YEW it is not just trees with three letter names that require miton main to topple them. The aforementioned pine and plamen, Sycamore and large are also firmly rooted. The reason they do not concern us today is that their names contain more than three letters. When dealing with a subject as wide ranging and breathtaking and complicated as trees, we have to focus our attentions more narrowly if we're to get anywhere, at least in the short term. Only those with the most fanatical interest will go the whole hog and devote the best part of their lives to the study of trees. The rest of us must make do with partial limited knowledge. We will wish to be sufficiently familiar with certain types of trees. So that we can hold our own in a tree based conversation. For example, we might be at a swish and sophisticated cocktail party and be buttonholed by a person who to break the ice says something regarding trees. It is interesting you should say that we can reply winningly for just the other day I read a piece about the ash and the box and the Elm and they you oh really says our interlocutor. And before we know it, the two of us are babbling away 19 to the doesn't, and getting on like a house on fire. Such social success is always rewarding. Had we not had a ready reply. We might have been left flailing and dem wicked, cluttering our cocktail glass and flushing with discomfort. It is not overwhelmingly important to be able to tell an ash from a box or an Elm from a u or a box from an Elm or a you from an ash or a box from a u or an ash from an L. If you can do so all well and good. But depending on the company at the cocktail party you are attending, you might want to keep that knowledge under your hat. If you begin to prattle on in detail about the trees and their characteristics, you might be taken for a fanatic with no interest in or knowledge of any other topic. Nobody wants to get stuck next to a moto maniac at a cocktail party.

Frank Key  11:41
Conversely, if you're the one who finds yourself trapped with a tree fanatical nutcase, intent on describing to you in brain numbing detail, the ash and the box and the Elm and the you, you can always topple over. They will interpret this as a swoon and call for smelling salts and perhaps a snifter brandy, you can then sit up and rub your head and look disconcerted. You might be ushered outside for a spot of fresh air. And if the cocktail party is taking place in a rustic location, there could be a copy or Spinney nearby, but in your fragile state, or at least, let us say your pretence of a fragile state. Nobody, not even the nutcase will call on you to identify the trees which may or may not include the ash, the box the Elm, the you

I've never been able to decide whether I prefer a SOP or a Philip to be given a sock can be immediately gratifying. But when you're able at leisure to consider what you really wanted, and then to be thunderstruck at the realization you've been fobbed off with a stop gratification can curdle swiftly into frustration, resentment, and in certain circumstances, psychopathic violence. Affiliate on the other hand, can come out of nowhere, unbidden, and set you up for the day, or at least for a few minutes, until they will enter the once again nor that by whatever gnaws at them, that differs from person to person. The tonic effects then of both the SOP and the Philip tend towards the ephemeral. One could argue that not withstanding the Philip is preferable. This is because when it wears off and you're again plunged into remorseless misery, there is not the concomitant dejection you get with the wearing off of the SOP. There's the knowledge that you've been fobbed off. You can't be fobbed off with a Philip. That's not in the nature of Phillips, though it's part and parcel of the SOP. We can perhaps grasp this more firmly by considering a concrete example. Here's Dobson from his pamphlet, what I have to say in toto about SOPs and Phillips out of print. It was a day in that blue month, September silent beneath plum trees slender shade, a nice, juicy Carlsbad plum I thought would be just the Philip I needed. It so happened that I was plunged in remorseless misery and my innards were being nadat by their intractable enemies, a legion of mental and emotional horas it would take far too long to list. Yes, the more I thought about it sprawled beneath the plum trees slender shade, the more I craved the Filip I would get from munching one of those plums. I have never been the sprite list of tree climbers. But on that day in that blue month, September, it so happened that I was wearing my Bolivian rainforest wardens tree climbing boots. What a happy accident. I stood up, dusted the Duff for my duffle coat. I'm prepared to clamber a little way up the trunk of the plum tree just high enough to pluck a plum. It was a strangely tall plum tree, as well all its fellows in this orchard. Just as I was about to begin my climb, I was disconcerted to see striding towards me aiming a shotgun the orchardist I knew he was the orchardist because of his proprietorial manner of striding across the loam, and the badge affixed to his duffle coat over his heart. Boy, he shouted, to not for one minute think you can climb and pluck a plum of mine from my plum tree. Nothing was further from my mind. I lied. I'm not the plum eating type. he shoved the barrel of his shotgun into my belly. I'm pleased to hear it, he said. Often I find picnickers and other reprobates lurking in my orchard who think the munching of a nice juicy Carlsbad plum is just the Philip they need to wrench them albeit temporarily out of their misery and horrors. Don't you fret about me on that score. I said. I am as happy as a lark. This ornithological Sally was a blatant fib, as my countenance was downcast and gloomy. It served however, to bamboozle the orchardist he hoisted the shotgun over his shoulder and mumbled something about the nesting habits of larks. I thought it best to skedaddle out of the orchard and find somewhere else to slump on that day in that blue month September.

As I trudged along the towpath of the old canal, past the cement works and the marmalade factory. I still crave the Philip of a plum to munch, causing to sit on a canalside bench place there in honor of Robert Fripp, I took from the inside pocket of my duffle coat, the Gazetteer of fritters, which in those days I always carried with me. If I could not steal a plum from an orchard, I could buy one from a fruiter I was young then you see, and my brain was in proper working order. Having ascertained that the nearest fruiter was a short bus ride away. I made my way to the bus stop and waited for a bus. When the bus arrived, I boarded it. I sat down, the bus conductor took my fair, peering out of the window at the sky. I became lost in thought about my imminent plum. I could almost taste it. What a Philip it would be. Shortly afterwards, I alighted from the bus at another bus stop and cross the road to enter the fritters. He was a curiously monkey like man, though his manners were polished. How may I be of assistance to you on this day in that blue month September? he asked. I would like to buy a nice juicy Carlsbad plum, please. I said I'm afraid I sold my last plum, Carl's bad or no. Just 15 minutes ago to a communist German playwright. He said. So my I recommend instead of conference pair, there would be no Filip for me. Instead, I was being fobbed off with a SOP. careful study of this passage will reward the reader with a dazzling insight into the fillit and the SOP. And this in spite of the fact that Dobson does not tell us whether he accepted the fruit routes offers of a con offer of a conference pair. It was long thought that He addressed this in his pamphlet, the blue September of conference pairs out of print, but recent textual x addresses by hot headed young Dobson his Ted CAC, demonstrates pretty damn conclusively that the September referred to in that pamphlet was after, not before the Tet offensive.

I'd like to read to you now from Edith Sitwell. I'd like to read the opening three paragraphs of her biography of Queen Victoria, Victoria of England, published in 1936. And chapter one is entitled, The death of the Duke of Kent. And these are the opening paragraphs. You may wonder why I'm want to read to you a bit from a biography of Queen Victoria, that should become apparent when I read them. Imagine you're about to write a biography of Queen Victoria, how would you begin? Would you begin like this? The little dry leaves are blowing against the windows of a house near the sea, with a sound like the whispering of small pale ghosts. They are blowing along the parade over the edge of the century. They are floating away and away into the far off plantations, where the country gentleman are rooted in the mold. Here they come, these small ghosts leftover, drifting over from the 18th century. Dry ghosts like the bow and Beelzebub or wicked shift, bogey and caliber goose rump and King jog moldy and Madagascar and snipe and Mr. creevey himself, brushing those beliefs together with his old hands. Soon, there will be no leaves left. On the 22nd day of January in the year 1820, while the threadbare looking see beat assembly upon the shore, a man of 52 years of age is once robust and reddish face now yellow is same guide black hair that had once been shining and carefully brushed where and he remained now dull with sweat and with the gray showing through the black and with the scowl showing through the hair, like dying upon a higher bed in Sid mouth.

Frank Key  23:29
Isn't that fantastic? I mean, they don't write them like that anymore. Do they? Who would begin to would begin a biography like that? And those lists of ghosts is interesting. I've got time I think for one more piece. I just have to work out what it is. I'll here this will do. This is the data. Just bear with me a moment please. And I will try and be back with you as soon as I can.

Yes, I've I've worked out what I'm going to read. Finally this week. This is called hist. Haste, haste and list this damned Mark list with each and every one of your ears and Mark well mark on your site as you list if you had cracks racks snapshot Your eyes are not on picture the yawning chasm opening before you the great gulf between you and the lithium. Then open up your eyes and scratch scratch scratch on your slate. Is it Elysium or Atlantis gondwanaland or shoeburyness wherever it is is beyond your reach beyond the gaping chasm on the brink of which you Tita or Brinks are teetering upon in this life. Mark that well, I'll blubber lips might have told you different back when but I'll blable it was put here purposely to mislead you could you not spot that? Consider? Consider first his blubbery lips. The blubbery face in which they sat the awful potato of his head contrasts the spindly arms and legs, and that voice, as if drawn out from between those blubber lips by the hot pincers of Gennady gak pincers forged in the subterranean furnace of fire tank Tara beam bada blind Tao Urbino scuttling dwars of gunnars DAC oh that shrubbery ness be twinned with so Fowler place But you knew not you were drunk on the gibbering of our blubber lips for you not you laptop, every splatter. And then the wind came in from the west. The Killing wind bringing pestilence and pomposity and skittery Pugwash blandishments, the wind came in and tossed you around like the various of tosspot on mod with new pimples in place of old you took your bearings when the wind passed. A new no longer way you were evolved Bulava lips there was no trace one last grant and he was gone. There was a cave mouth into which some say he fled, but it flooded and you could not follow and as cracks opened and spat mud, you sought safety and a spinny of beach and box and Sycamore. Now there came the sound of gunfire in the distance and the weird music of xylophones and wobbly sores. And so the Long March, the Long March to illicium or Atlantis to gondwanaland or shrubbery ness, you were accompanied along the way by birds, so many birds, you could not count them and you came to the chasm and teetered on the brink. The birds turned healed buckle flew back from whence they came. You fasik in your pocket for your slight you plaque from your tresses, a pointy thing lodged there by the wind and all your mutterings and drag bearings and curses ceased, as you were made to hit paste and vitalist with all your ears and Mark, Mark well, and take the measure.
