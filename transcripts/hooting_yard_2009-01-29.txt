I also have explained that that piece was simply a list of titles of the books currently being written by the best selling paperback is pebble head. He always has a number of works on the go at any one time. expertly juggling everything in that big baked potato like head of his and hooting yard reader and listener Dr. Ruth pastry tells me that she's drawing a diagram of pebble heads head, or more precisely of the innards of his head, which she wants me to post on the hooting ARD website when it's finished. That means we all have a better and long overdue insight into the great paper backtest fantastic brain in diagrammatic form with arrows and onwards now to a story about the cow on pins. The cow on pins was the singularly squalid tavern, much frequented by humans GM. Once long ago, it had been a coaching in but the construction of an efficient canal system destroyed the coach trade and barges passing by a board there barges upon the canal were a salubrious lot who drank tea from flasks and read improving literature. The cow and pins stood crumbling and full on on the line parallel to the towpath of the canal. And soon only the crumbling and the full on the indigent and the misbegotten. The violent and the psychopathic ever set foot upon its rotten sawdust covered floor. One psychopath who became a tavern regular the ferocious babinski took over as the landlord after chopping up the existing incumbent with an axe and feeding him to the pigs. The pigs who lived happily in a pigsty a little way down the lane from the tavern did not of course know their swell that day contained the ground up remains of their power from the cow and pins, who used to commune with them in a hearty man to pig way whenever he got the chance. With babinski at the helm, things changed babinski hated pigs. And after that first feeding, he shunned the STI Some said in fear that the specter of the man he had chopped up and then ground up and then stirred in with the pigs will lay in wait for him there to wreak revenge from the realm of death. It is more likely, however, that babinski was too busy being mad and bad and dangerous in the tavern where he now held sway he tore down From the woods the showbiz memorabilia that had most recently adorned them, gone with the photographs of the previous landlord, arm in arm with Rolf Harris and Val dunican. Edith Sitwell gone with the autograph pork crates of can home and Tammy Wynette gone with the posters, advertising pentos with Keith keg winners buttons and George Galloway as pol pot. in their place babinski pinned up his weird handwritten screeds pages and pages ripped from the exercise books which he filled with gibberish. Out went the barrels of ale when the bottles of champagne and ligatures and rare expensive brandies out went the soft drinks and the mineral waters and in their place was installed a single vast trough into which was poured and out of which was labeled into dented 10. beakers. Disgusting bilge made of God knows what its taste was foul, but it was cheap, and just a beaker full or to suffice to ravage the drinkers brain. Zombie dumb. babinski himself allowed no other fluid into his body, which probably accounted for what one might charitably call his eccentricities. Under his predecessor, there had been a jukebox in the cow and pins well stocked with the gems of prog rock babinski smashed it up with his axe and sharpened the edges of the discs inside so he could use them as missiles, slicing through the air to hit and sever a juggler or other important veins through which the blood relentlessly pumps then he dug a deep deep pit and fade wires down in it wires at the end of which were microphones that picked up the constant agonized howling and screaming of sinners being tormented for eternity in the pits of Hell, amplified and blaring an ear splitting volume from speakers placed all around the tavern.

It was a rough and raucous place perilous for the we the toper, who might once have sat in the snug watching coaches rattled by the Snuggie itself had been demolished by babinski. And the space it had occupied was now our charnel ground stacked with the bleached bones of those he slew when he was in the mood for slaying which was most days. Sometimes the villain would pole vault across the canal like Spring Heeled jack for the sole purpose of setting upon a poor innocent orphan or crippled, plucking flowers for those gay friendly canalside shrub beds. babinski carried out his killings with impunity for a type of amnesia stalk the land, and even the police officers blundered about in a hypnogogic days. The one law that was rigorously enforced in this land of efficient canals was that which regulated the licensing hours of taverns even babinski Yes, bubinski himself was terrified of the tavern time creo three brutes who patrolled on horseback to ensure that every Tavern was locked and bolted and dark and silent, as the clock struck the witching hour. Their horses were as brutish as the trio themselves. Gigantic fierce beasts with repulsive fetlocks and mains matted with MK, whose Marist Winnie was 1000 times more hideous than the infernal muzak of the cow and pins. Freeman Hardy and Willis the horses were called, but nobody knew the names of their riders, for nobody ever dared to ask, just as no taverner ever dared to let his Tavern stay open for one second past closing time. Nobody could even remember when the law had been broken. So nobody knew what punishment would be meted out by the tavern time trio. The sheer size of the horses and their ranks stink and the thunder of their hooves is like gallop from Tavern to Tavern and the brutishness of the trio themselves in their gold LeMay tuxedos and Snow White's bats and the piercing whistles they blew as they rode, and the official documents poking out of their pockets. These things were enough to cow each and every Tavern keeper babinski included. So it was that in spite of the clamor, an uproar of the cow and pins, easily the most exciting part of the day was chucking out time. Humans scum, their brains and bodies jangled by whatever it was they'd been gulping down from babinski trough would be startled by the sudden cessation of the amplified agonies of the nether world, there is a sailed instead by babinski hooter. Those of you familiar with this contraption will know that it was the most powerful hooter that ever existed on Earth, or on any other planet in any other universe. A hooter par excellence, the ne Plus Ultra of Hooters, who took the like of which we shall never hear again, for which in truth, we should be thankful. babinski pop is who to just once to signal that the cow and pins was closing for the night, and once was all it was needed to imagine hearing that hooter who twice in succession is more than the mind can bear whether the mind is sane and sober or blasted to fuddled by dented tin beaker fulls of disgusting build. Not that the sane or the sober would be found among the human wreckage, who hearing the hooter drain the last drops of builds from their beakers, and tossed the beakers into the trough. Then, out of the tavern, they tumbled and jumble of chaos, many of them toppling into the canal, others falling and lying flat on their backs where they fell in the mud, where they would remain insensible until the cow and pins opened its doors the next morning. And inside the tavern babinski, who never slept, filled with build all the beakers that had been tossed into the trough, and lined them up on the counter. He put on his super loud bang and bang, bang, bang quadrophonic headphones, and switch to subterranean microphones back on. As he listened to the shrieks of the sinful, he worked his way through the line of beakers one after another, and when he was done, he wrote one of his weird screens and pinned it to the wall, and then he lumbered out into the dead of night in search of something to slaughter.

The cow and pins was of course, Dobson's preferred tavern, but by the time the out of print pamphleteer came to patronize it babinski was long dead, and it was once again the kind of place where we the toper could sit in the snug and scribble a pamphlet. Not that Dobson was we the exactly, he occasionally got into fights and acquitted himself with aplomb. As for babinski, hooter, when the new landlord took over the tavern, he had it dismantled by specialists from a hooter dismantling Squadron to be on the safe side, they buried the parts separately in deep lead lined wells, unmarked and scattered across six continents. foolishly though, the captain of the squadron made a map, pinpointing the locations to keep as a souvenir. And last week, it was reported in the daily hooter that the map had been stolen. Yes, friends, it is a terrible possibility that even now somewhere out there, and Madcap genius is hard at work, putting babinski hooter back into one piece. You may well say, eat. I know I did.

Tom now for one of our occasional hooting yard folk songs, regular listeners will know that I can't sing for the life of me, so I just read these folk song lyrics. But I thought, it might be an idea to use a regional accent for this one. And I don't know if you've ever noticed, but on television dramas, all peasants seem to come from the West Country. It doesn't matter where the setting of the bucolic drama or comedy, The peasants always have West Country accent, so I thought I'd do my best to attempt a West Country accent to read the lyrics to an old folk song, commemorating victory in the war against the big magnetic robots. from high up on pill garlic tour, we watched the march away to war. away they marched our foes to fight, and they put the robot men to flight. The big knock magnetic robots fled, and not a trap of ours was dead. They scattered in their clanking way to Timbuktu and Mandalay traps marked home in triumph then. And so we sacrifice their hand. We wallowed in our poultry, Gore, victorious on pill garlic tour.

And I'm quite happy to accept any complaints from West Country listeners who feel that I just credited their accent. But I did my best. I thought I sounded like a television peasant. What was I going to say? Yes. Just a reminder. If you don't already regularly do so, I do suggest that you visit the shooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org where you'll find lots and lots of stuff to read. Some pictures to look at, including recently posted one of Metropolitan Carroll of Smolensk, who may or may not be the head of the new Russian Orthodox Church with a couple of beatniks and what else there's a new thing on the website, which is how you can buy books from there hooting, your books are available paperbacks. And there's a new subscription service, credit crunch proof subscription service, you can get either a tiny Enid an old hollub, pebble egg or a Dobson. Just go to the website and click on subscriptions and think how exciting that will be because of the Christmas break here at resonance, and then my own break after Christmas. There's a lot of material that was actually written topically you know, for that period. And it seems a shame to wait until next Christmas to read it. So this was published on the website, I think the day before Christmas Eve. So just cast your mind back just over a month ago. And this is what it said. The latest victim of crunchy credit conditions is pebble heads Christmas annual drew to be published tomorrow, ie Christmas Eve, but now indefinitely postponed. The best selling paperback is has been issuing his annuals every Christmas Eve for as long as anybody can remember. So this is what is known in the language of his potboilers as a bitter blow. Indeed, one of the features of this year's annual was to be an exciting tale of polar tragedy called Captain Jarvis and his starving Huskies are pressed flat against a glassier by the bitter blows of an Antarctic blizzard. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to read that to my grandchildren as a bedtime story. Noren DITA acted out in the community hub frolicking compound, if necessary, using bags of flour as a slow substitute, should the weather continue Bomi. As ever, the annual was to contain dozens of stories pebble head dashed off this past year in between writing his tremendous novels. According to the publisher's blurb, we were promised such gems as Vanessa Redgrave and the revolutionary space cadets, the $6 million goat and EU law law as he sinks beneath the waves. Captain Jarvis recalls what bliss was it in that dorm to have a mild headache? It's something of a mystery why pebble head has yet to write an entire novel about this Captain Jarvis character who gets into all sorts of exciting scrapes in all sorts of locations, exotic and otherwise. Last year story, Captain Jarvis topples out of a hot air balloon piloted by Richard Branson was particularly thrilling. We could also have expected many pictures of bees, ducks, gaping chasms, weasels, kitchen utensils, frog person's eggs, Ludvig vidkun, Stein cardboard boxes, giraffe heads and tweezers. pebble head has been criticized for retaining the same picture categories year after year, every single annual containing three cack handed pencil drawings of each subject all crammed into the end papers. But I think this says a good deal about the man. He's reliable. He's consistent. He's a best selling paperback guest and he can't draw for toffee. This is factual articles work to include a potted history of potted plants. pastes analysis of sulfurous woozy barbershop quartet demons, an annotated diagram of Christ wounds and a reprint of pebble heads, classic pig paragraph. Add to that the quiz and the cutout board game and the coating of scum upon the dust jacket. And it's clear we'll all be bereft at this time of otherwise unbridled jollity.

And finally, this week I'd like to give you some advice on how to care for your innermost soul. It can be the devil of a job to keep a pig type cited. The standard pig type has three basic behaviors, grunting interminably until it fed eating the food it's given and mercifully, taking postprandial naps. one learns to treasure those naps, for they're the only respite one gets from the pig tape. Even then, it tends to grunt and snaffle and wheeze in its sleep. So it still makes a noise so not as horrible noises. It's incessant grunting for food when awake. Are they absolutely disgusting chomping and slobbering noises it makes when it's eating. It's fortunate that the pig tape is such a tiny being and the volume of its noises commensurate with its size. Otherwise one would be deafened by it and not merely deafened, but driven from polite society banished to a wilderness. Most pig tapes are audible only to their hosts, which is a bad enough state of affairs. The correct term is little pig tape, and it's similar to a tapeworm, except that the pig type dwells within the soul. This does not mean that the pig type grunts for spiritual sustenance, such as the reading of books by Deepak Chopra, the food or widget grunts is all too solid cream crackers and cockles and mussels and lemon meringue pie and bloaters and truck ices and coos, cousine pastry and vinegar and a spit roasted half of an ox and oboe jeans and dumplings and suet pudding, to name but a baker's dozen of its cravings before it lasted is replete and takes a noisy nap. The little pigtail somehow sucks all the food out of your stomach through internal piping to it cranny in your soul. Because it's so tiny and dwells within so inaccessible a spot ridding oneself of a pigtail is well nigh impossible. Maybe not even well nigh, but just impossible full stop. Certainly there are no recorded cases in the literature of anything resembling a little pig tape being extracted from a body either during a surgical procedure upon the living or an autopsy upon the dead. Nor is it at all clear how one acquires a pig type in the first place. We all have our sacred souls, but not all souls provide a home to these miniscule grunting greedy monsters. And it's not true despite what you may have had drummed into you by priests or parents, that the presence or absence of a pigtail is dependent in some way upon one's moral and this management. Of course, it's advisable not to eat too much contaminated pork, but for a host of other reasons, such as indigestion or death. That's the end of this week's show. I do hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week with more of the same bye bye
