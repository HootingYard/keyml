Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And I'd like to begin this week with one of our earth shattering yet clear eyed series, things they don't want you to know. Have you noticed when handling your Android device that if you try to turn the screen around to view it upside down, it immediately flips to restore the default view. This was trumpeted as an exciting and user friendly feature of tablet computers from the very first it is of course, nothing of the sort. It is rather a blatant example of the capitalist military industrial complex, probably abetted by the Freemasons and the Zionist and the lizard people from outer space, preventing you from realizing that the Android is in reality, a clock card. If you look at the Android logo upside down, that's what it says.

There's babbling going on here in the studio, but perhaps it will come to an end. Between the years 1787 and 1804. In the ethereal realms, the dead Gluck, and the unborn Glinka became friends and allies. They were drawn together by neutral puzzlement, the absence from those same realms of Baxter hewed, who had been dead since 1707. And ought therefore, to have put in an appearance in the mystic ether, Gluck and Glinka or their spirit essences set out to track down bugs to hewed or his immortal soul, a quest which only came to an end when drinker was transformed into a material mewling infant in 1804. good habit to drum his heels and our white drinkers returned to the ethereal realms in 1857. By this time, of course, Baxter, huge, immortal soul had been missing for a full 150 years, which is as close as dammit to a cut off point in the world of spirits. This is the conceit of an unfinished novel by algernon spooky, the so called psychic window cleaner, who has a Wacom part in virtually every single biography and memoir of the first half of the 20th century. Spooky seems to have known everybody and frequently got into fistfights with them. He was a commanding figure described by Tipton as resembling a cross between a Roman emperor and a Harry a hawk with a bit of the temple of Angkor Wat thrown in. Unfortunately for the fate of his novel, algernon spooky, had a 10 year and knew nothing of music. So there's attempts to bring the souls of Brooke and Glinka and Baxter hewed to fictional life are in the words of picked on again, like watching an idiot child drool into a tin cup. After scribbling thousands and thousands of words, spooky realized he was making a fool of himself, not for the first time and tried to rework the material into a detective thriller. Here, Gluck gonca and Baxter huge, became a trio of malefactors plotting dark and dismal deeds. They hide in plain sight, operating from a high street shoe shop, clearly modeled on Freeman Hardy and Willis only, only when Freeman or Harley Or Willis, or Freeman and Hardy, or Hardy and Willis or Freeman and Willis or for Christ's sake, let's have done with it. All three of them, got wind of spooky tail and threatened him with a libel suit did that manuscript to end up in the dustbin. But being algernon spooky, it was no ordinary dustbin. He styled it his magical ancient Egyptian dustbin from the realm of false and scratched various arcane symbols upon it. He then tried to sell the dustbin to a credulous follower to doubt Duchess Dipsy of pox Ivan, warning her that she must never ever remove the lid from the dustbin for fear of unleashing several malign demons from the ancient mystic City of God. Even poor dim witted gipsy saw this for the poppy kocot was and she had algernon spooky dragged out of her drawing room and beaten to within an inch of his life with cuddles by her valet, the one time champion wrestler dinmore. What happened to the dustbin thereafter is not known. algernon spooky illegitimate daughter Pooh Belle, who acted as his literary executor tricks consistently denied the existence of the two Gluck, Glinka and Baxter huge manuscripts. It was only when peptan bashed her repeatedly on their head with an electric toaster that she finally spilled the beans.

in the annals of nautical heroism, few men have been as nautically heroic as Admiral Bagshaw bag of the HMS crinkle cut oven chip, holding sway on the bridge of his majestic ship. standing on one leg of flesh and bone and the other of the finest mahogany from the Dutch Antilles, a Pappy and mash a parrot perched on his Pappy and mash a shoulder, his original shoulder having been shot away during a particularly violent episode of nautical heroism during a mahogany gathering expedition to the Dutch Antilles a few weeks ago. The Admiral was a man of few words. One of those words and the one he spat out more often than any other was piffle. The Admiral shouted piffle when he woke up in the morning, and he shouted piffle last thing at night before he fell asleep between times holding sway on the bridge of his majestic ship, he repeatedly found cause to shout piffle. The Brian soaked sailors of his crew were not always clear why he was shouting piffle, and nor, to be fair, was the admiral himself. It may simply have been a verbal tic, if a rather loud and jarring one. The remains of the actual parrot on which the Pappy and mash a one had been modeled, were kept in cold storage in the admirals personal cold storage unit tucked beneath the desk in his cabin. Inside it was colder than the coldest of refrigerators. Indeed, it was so cold. It was scarcely believable from a scientific viewpoint. But the admiral was not a scientist. He was a man of nautical heroism, partly wooden and partly Pappy mashite and with one I made of glass, and the fingers of one hand, molded from dough and baked to a crisp in spite of his nautical heroism, the admiral was to his crew, a figure of petty and not mild, Petty, but a heart rending extravagant pity provocative of strangulated choking sobs and mortification of the bowels. Suck pity read Did the crew fairly useless in circumstances where nautical heroism was called for, for example, on mahogany gathering expeditions to the Dutch Antilles, the admiral tried to pet them up and stiffen their sinews by increasing their rum rations. But this served only to make them more mawkish. Several of the crew in their cups wrote tear stain letters home to their dear old mothers, describing in forensic intoxicated detail, the pity they felt for their Admiral. inside its cold storage unit, the parrot was not actually dead. It was in a state of suspended animation, from which the admiral plans to revive it, so that one day he would be able to purge it on his other shoulder, still, at a time of writing of flesh and bone. To accomplish His plan, the admiral had set little Tim the cabin boy to a course of study in massive scientific, including cryogenic freezing, and subsequent thawing. Unfortunately, the only book on board ship was a tattered copy of laughter at the foot of the cross by Michael a screech from which several crucial pages were missing. Little Tim the cabin boy was the one member of the crew who did not pity the Admiral. I have no time for pity, he said in his high pitched little voice When interviewed on Dutch Antilles radio, as part of a series of interviews we've shipped Kevin Boyd, I have no time to any of the finer emotions, he continued. But I have dedicated my life thus far, not that there's been much of it to preparing myself for future acts of nautical heroism, the sort of nautical heroism in which the finer emotions can play no part, now handed me that sextant and that Cutlass so I made practice.

And so the HMS crinkle cut oven chip sails on, either towards or away from the Dutch Antilles, with or without a cargo of mahogany. Listen to the wind in the rigging, a wind that kills it kills the crew, one by one until only the admiral and little Tim the cabin boy and the parrot in cold storage are still with us. nautical and hydraulic upon us shining sea.

The book laughter the foot of the cross by Michael a screech, which was mentioned in that last piece is in fact a real book. I didn't make it up. I haven't read it. But it's a book of theology, obviously, and I think it might well be worth reading with an with an author's name and a book title like that sounds pretty good to me. Anyway, onto something else. I just wanted to make sure you realize I hadn't made that up. I thought it'd be interesting to run a series examining the contents of the glove boxes of the rich and famous. That's right, I finally taken leave in my senses. What was I thinking? For one thing, I have minimal interest in the rich and famous. Second, the glove box is part of a car. And I know nothing about cars, like Pablo Picasso and Darren Brown, I have never learned to drive. It could be argued that the contents of a glove box have nothing to do with the car per se, and that there may be intrinsic interest in the jumble of knick knack to be found in the average glove box. But If that's so, then the contents of the glove boxes of the indigent and the record are likely to hold as much interest as those of the rich and famous. Though of course the degrees of indigence and wretchedness appurtenant the greater they are, the less likely the subject would be to own a car. And therefore, a glove box. Could the word glove box be applied to any box in which gloves are kept? In my world? You're damn right it could. I'm thinking for example of a cardboard shoe box from Freeman Hardy and Willis, which when new can find a pair of shoes, or even galoshes, but which has long since been reimagined as a handy box in which to store a selection of gloves, particularly discarded single gloves where the matching glove has been lost. You might wonder why such gloves of use only to amputees have not simply been thrown away into a bin or down a waste chute. You might wonder, but I don't, I can discern the beauty in a cardboard box crammed with old and abandoned gloves. In fact, I would go so far as to say it is going to waste shoved out of sight in a cupboard under the stairs better by far to take the lid off, exposing the gloves and paste a little sticker on the side bearing the legend with a capitalism and sell it for a small fortune to a contemporary art gallery. So contemporary art, bankers can claim it is an interrogation of something or other. When you've counted up your cash payment from the gallery, and stuffed into your pocket, you can punch the nearest art banker in the throat, which is a valuable if violent use of anybody's time.

Frank Key  17:06
Having dismissed the idea of running a series examining the glove boxes of the rich and famous, I wonder if instead it might be interesting to run a series on the boxing gloves of the indigent and record. That's right, I'd finally taken leave with my senses. Again, what was I thinking? For one thing I know precious little about boxing or its gloves. Second, I would rather know much less than I do about the indigent and record, otherwise known as riffraff. Much, much less if i neva never came upon another member of the riffraff or die a happy man. Unfortunately, on their rare occasions, when I emerge for my dial japanesey and barrel of reclusion, and venture into the outside world, I can barely move for the teeming throngs of riffraff. I'm always amused by the fact that the court ministers and they're like claim to be devoted to the needs of the riffraff. They hate and despise the riffraff more than I do. It's a mutual loathing which the Corbin list is explained by saying the riffraff are bedeviled by false consciousness. Frankly, I'd be surprised if the riffraff I encounter have any consciousness whatsoever, unless it be a malign intention to exasperate me. That is something in which they demonstrate and almost enviable skill. Clearly, given the above, I'm not best placed to write about the boxing gloves of the indigent and record. Could I then turn my attention to the boxing gloves of the rich and famous? I suppose I could, but for the full run of a series. That seems dubious, to say the least. Once I've dealt with Ernest Hemingway's many and various punch ups, with a nod to Kwan Miro and Arthur Craven, I would pretty much have exhausted my knowledge as to which Hemingway's fistfights were usually boxing gloveless, as when he knocked Wallace Stevens into a puddle in 1936. And Arthur Craven was neither rich nor famous in his time, and the paucity of material I have to draw on becomes horribly apparent. So to face brute facts, that's another projected series I shall have to dismiss as a hopeless dream. Oh, that gives me an idea. hopeless dreams of the riffraff. Now there's a topic I could get my teeth into. And being based on dreams, I could just make it all up. No pesky research required. I shall start work on it immediately.

I do realize that saying disobligingly things about carbon esters on resonance is probably deeply verboten and shouldn't ever happen. And I should probably meant to apologize in case I've offended anyone. But you know, if I've offended a call minister, I don't care.

Frank Key  20:42
just deal with it, as I say. Anyway, you know, that's that I thought I better make that non apology. I went to the shops in border foghorn. I thought it would come in handy if I were to find myself embroiled in the fog of war. I could take my foghorn. And then, well, to be honest, I hadn't really thought beyond that. But they make foghorns for a purpose and a benign one. So I felt sure that in the fog of war, my foghorn would prove invaluable. It might even save my life. at time of writing, I am or was fortunate to live in a peaceable kingdom. King Gobbo is a peaceable man. And though he has proved been provoked by certain of our neighbors, over matters such as cow pastures and slurry pits and thermonuclear devices, he has thus far managed to maintain the peace, either by capitulating to the aggressive demands in a formal manner, or by laying waste to their territories by deploying his fiercely loyal army of psychotic blood drenched nutcases within our borders, and they're very pretty borders. We remain at peace. That being the case, I have not yet needed to to my foghorn.

Frank Key  22:12
I've not needed to excuse me. I've not needed to but I too, did it anyway, to test it out. There was no fog. It was a clear day, you could see forever I tooted my phone call. It sounded rather eyes imagine, rather as I imagined a combination of bassoon and Piccolo with sound, playing a single protracted note amplified to deafening volume. The particular maker of foghorn I had bought worked by a simple mechanism, you depress the knob to turn it on, and depress the knob again, to turn it off. Unfortunately, I could be a bit of a butterfingers and when I depress the knob to turn it on, I somehow managed to jam it, so that when I tried to depress it again to turn it off, my efforts were in vain. As I said, it was bloody loud. And after trying to depress the knob a couple more times, I had to put my hands over my ears. I stood there, like a fool at the junction of ritually slaughtered poultry Street and Ringo Starr Boulevard on a clear day when you could see forever. And of course, if I could see forever, then so could everybody else or most of them. I wondered if I could pretend that the fog corn was nothing to do with me that I just happened to be passing by when some unseen miscreant depressed it knob. But I have the receipt from the foghorn shop in my pocket. And it would certainly be found when King gobos secret police bundled me into a van and took me to one of their damp, dark subterranean interrogation chambers. I looked while we around to see if there was a municipal waste bin into which I could check the receipt. Doing so would involve having to uncover one of my ears for the time it took to remove this receipt from my pocket and discard it in the bin. And I might well be deaf in that ear forever after. But that seemed my best option if I could accomplish it before the arrival of the secret police. But they were no bins to be seen. Even though it was a clear day and I could see forever. Then I remembered King gobos latest you case proclaim from his balcony just the other day. bins were banned throughout the land. bins were only necessary where there was waste, the king declared and in His Kingdom, nothing went to waste. We were he said a frugal and didn't creamiest people who would eat everything, everything until it was beyond further eating, and could be eat no more. Or at least we are better shape up and become that frugal and ingenious people or else with my hands over my ears and thinking about that else, and the secret police and the damp, dark subterranean interrogation chambers, I decided to make a run for it. I ran and ran until we're dean of the foghorn was slightly less deafening. I ran until I reached the border. It was a very pretty border. I handed myself over to the enemy border guards and begged for mercy. I would think twice before buying another phone call one.

I'd like to finish this week show with a little poem or song. And it's a song by as you as you know, any any listeners who've been listening for a while now I can't sing someone cry. I mean, it's about a particularly p Quint. Love Triangle. I think it might bring tears to your eyes. It certainly brought tears to mine. And it's not very long. But so there's time to to read it before the end of the show. And I'll sort of say goodbye now. And leave you with this little little ditty about a very emotionally wrenching love triangle.
