Good evening pals. This is hooting yard on the air. With me, Frank key, Graham on resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. We might be listening to the podcast at some point in the future. I've been reading I may have mentioned this. Last week or the week before I've been reading a biography of Ambrose bierce written in published in 1967 by Richard O'Connor. Ambrose bierce, of course, best known still today for his Devil's dictionary, but he was spent most of his career as a journalist and one of his on various magazines. And at one point he was, I can't remember which book which magazine it was, but he was the book reviewer. And according to Richard O'Connor in his biography, and I quote, the book reviewing and of his chores, predictably, loosed beer says most savage energies. He wants composed what may be the shortest nastiest book review on the record, by listing its title, author, and publisher, and adding the one line comment. The covers of this book are too far apart. Occasionally, like an eagle swooping down on the carry and littered planes of literature, he would quote one paragraph of the current novel as an example of hopelessly bad writing, such as she remained inactive in his embrace for a considerable period. Then, modestly, disengaging herself, looked him full in the countenance and signified the desire for self communion. By love's instinct, he divined her purpose. She wanted to consider his proposal apart from the influence of the glamour of his personal presence with the innate tact of a truly genteel nature. He Bade her Good evening in French, and with measured tread, paste away into the gathering bloom. Last were not told the titles of the two books under review. And speaking of books, the exciting news is that the 2010 hooting yard paperback I've done a paperback every year since 2006. The 2010 paperback is now available. It's entitled impugned by a peasant and other stories. It contains 114 stories. So as a nice fat book, like the one that came out two years ago, gravitas, punctilious rectitude and Pepe bags, both of those books and the other three are available via the heating yard website. Go to hooting yard.org. And you'll find details of you can only buy them online. So that's how you need to buy it. But the perfect Christmas gift, really, you can get impugned by a peasant and other stories. So I think you should go and buy that now. Perhaps in the pause between this, and then there'll be a little bit of the music. And while while the music's playing, you can go and buy the book, and then I'll come back.

Excuse me, Well, good. So when I log into the computer later, after when I get home after the show, I shall expect the numbers of copies sold to have risen immensely. And apart from the hooting yd website I've for the last few months I've been doing a column weekly at a newish website called the dabbler which I recommend every Friday. There's keys covered. And apart from the stuff that I do. There's always many things worth reading there. However, It is absolutely a superb website, but it pains me to have to track a brick back, but track a brick bat I must, quite frankly it passeth all understanding that a postage up at the dabbler with the promising title, important monkey stroke flying squirrel insight news, signally failed to mention Dobson's groundbreaking pamphlet, a detailed account of how I provided emergency medical assistance, despite having not a job of training to a flying squirrel, exhausted and maimed after being pursued and attacked by a small tough guide Japanese macaque monkey, which mistook it for a predatory bird. With several diagrams and an afterword quoting a Jethro Tull song lyric out of print. We tend not to think of the great pamphleteer as a sort of trap to dispense succor to small wounded animals. After all, he was much more likely to throw pebbles at swans, or to rain imprecations down upon puppies. But painstaking research has shown that the detailed account he gives is absolutely factual. What happened was that Dobson took a detour through a monkey and squirrel sanctuary, while on his way home from a visit to who Berman's that most gorgeous of department stores where he had bought a large supply of bandages and lineament. His purchases were made with a distinct purpose for sloshing around in his head was the idea of writing a pamphlet about bandages and lineament as part of a projected series with the collective title, various things you can smear on wounds and various methods of protecting wounds from the elements. According to his notes, there were to be at least 12 pamphlets in the series, but not a single one was ever written, possibly because of the turn of events in the monkey and squirrel sanctuary. Close to the perimeter fence. Dobson chanced upon a mewling and maimed flying squirrel and saw a small Japanese macaque monkey scampering away with squirrel blood dripping from it, gob. The pamphleteer put two and two together, then quite out of character he knelt down applied liniment to the gashes on the flying squirrel, and and wrapped it in bandages. He had a mind to take it home to marigold to as a prospective pet to replace her recently deceased weasel. Alas, so thoroughly the dogs and apply the bandages that the Flying Squirrel was suffocated. The pamphleteer chose a spot close to the blister lane bypass and buried the Flying Squirrel in a shallow grave. Every day for weeks afterwards, he visited to place a sprig of dalias or lupins on the plot, and he wept. He never told marigold to what he had done, and it seems that she never got around to reading the pamphlet, one of the few works of Dobson to be commercially printed rather than typeset and cranked out on marigold choose stettler machine. Incidentally, the quotation from Jethro Tull which appears on the last page of the pamphlet is so where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday, from thick as a brick? its significance to the text that accompanies has eluded every Dobson is to is tried to Winkle some meaning from it. I suppose that's one of the reasons we still read Dobson today. He continues to challenge us.

And next on the show this week, a play or a play lit in for scenes. of necessity, I'm going to be playing all the parts, but I'll tell you who's who as we go along. The play is called the monkey house incident. Scene one, the monkey house at Central Park Zoo, New York on the 16th of November 1906. I foreign gent and a respectable lady are standing by the cage of Naco, the monkey foreign gent good morning, madam, respectable lady, turning to look at him. Why, sir, you are like until the sun god, your light obliterates your surroundings. But do you always keep your hands in your overcoat pockets when addressing a respectable lady? foreign gent moves towards the respectable lady and annoys her, or possibly not. Enter the New York cop. New York cop to the foreign gent. I've had my eye on you, chum. You're under arrest. nahko The monkey looks on while monkeying about in his cage. Same to the police cells later that day. The foreign gent is weeping loudly. Enter Heinrich Kohn read director of the New York Metropolitan Opera. Foreign gent still weeping. Thank heaven you have come. Heinrich Kohn read. Don't you worry about a thing. I have posted bail. Do you think for one minute I would allow Enrico Caruso, the finest Italian tenor of the mall to languish in prison. Scene three the courtroom A week later. prosecuting counsel. Tell us what happened. Officer. New York cop. This foreign jet was annoying several women and girls in full view of nakoda monkey in the monkey house. He has slits in the pockets of his overcoat. Enrico Caruso, that is not knocko prosecuting counsel. It is because of the crowd of moral perverts and dogs and cars out there in the courtroom, who come here to listen, our mothers and our sisters are not safe in the streets like cannot go about without being subjected to insult by this scum from that Alaska Reto of Naples. Judge to the foreign gent who is indeed famous tenor Enrico Caruso, Guilty as charged, I find new $10 seen for the fire station later. Alfred m downs thinking aloud. This monkey house incident and the subsequent legal pallava has stirred public interest in Naco the monkey he may have been one of the monkeys captors mascots by the fire department until where disruptive antics meant they had to be removed to the zoo. I think I will take advantage of the brouhaha and write a book called firefighters and their pets. It should be ready for publication by next year. And the curtain falls

you'll be pleased to know that that was a that play was based entirely on fact. And in fact contains even contains quotes from the trial transcript. This first further information at the hooting yard website. If you look for the monkey incident, the monkey house incident the bottom of the bottom of the postage on the monkey house incident there's further read a link to further reading. Never don't say you don't burden things from hooting yard. And Rico Kuru SOS 10 pound fine for annoying a woman at sent in the monkey house. Anyway, and while you're at the while you're at the hooting yard website Don't forget to either buy some books or make a donation or take out a subscription. Always very welcome. binder was a highly competitive composer. constantly seeking to outdo his illustrious predecessors. He pitted himself against bark and borodin, Beethoven and Berg, each of whose names you will note begin with be like binders own. This fixation had its origin somewhere within the pulsing grape jelly of the binder brain. And we know of any one occasion when he directed his efforts to going one better over a composer out with the ranks of the bees. If Richard Strauss could Write for last songs. He shouted one day at his help meet the dwarf Keira Pascoe. Then I shall write five. Very gently the dwarf crew Pascoe, who was both tactful and wise, pointed out to binder that he was yet a young man at the outset of his career, and that to be writing his last songs, so early was, shall we say, a tad premature? Why the hell should I wait until I'm an octogenarian, as Strauss was when he wrote his last songs shouted binder. Dammit, I shall write mine now. And they will be five in number not a pitiable for and hardly with the words out of his mouth than the impatient young hothead strode out of his chalet and down the mountainside to town to buy a ream of sheet music, paper and a borrow. Keira Pascoe settled back on the divan by the oil heater and devised a two pronged strategy. The first prong was to ensure that throughout his career, however long it turned out to be, he forbade binder from ever writing another song. While this prong to fail as well, it might POSCO reasons that he could long in the future, scribble a sneaky amendment to the date on the manuscript of the five last songs and forge parallel documentation if necessary, to confound the historians. This was his second prong. Well satisfied, he closed his eyes and dreamed the dreams of a dwarvish helpmeet until binder returned. The first of the five last songs a glistening Google was polished off that very same day, binder took us his model, the jaunty cowboy song, the man with the fold back is by the Reverend Fred lane. Indeed, he took the song hole in an act of plagiarism, and then tweaked it here and there scoring for a Piccolo instead of a guitar, undermining the rhythm, inserting a campfire atmosphere, and translating the words into one of the Nordic tongues. It is thought that Chris Pascoe has had still half in dreamland suggested the wash of melancholy, overlaying the finished piece, and melancholy so overpowering that most listeners begin to weep during this first song, and do not stop until the following four have played out. It was creepy Moscow to who provided the words for the second song. He was steeped in the folk tales of his Carpathian homeland, and often times over breakfast would regale binder with a story or to one of his favorites was the fable of the carpet beetle and the submarine captain. And he had a bridge this a long winded and frankly idiotic er to a dozen rhyming couplets.

Finding the breakfast cereal carton, upon which he had scribbled his version to help meet dwarf let it left it upon the rough hewn rustic wooden carpenters bench were at this time in his career binder lights to compose, inspired as Chris Pascoe knew he would be binder set the word to what he dubbed a metaphysical on par heavy on the kooba it was quite out of keeping with the mood of the first song, but once again, Pascoe applied a wash of melancholy, this time, particularly unremitting. Much has been written about the washes of Pascoe with some critics insisting he has claims to be credited as co writer of the five last songs, he disavowed such lobbying on his behalf contend to remain in the shadows. binder was a genius he wrote many years later, and his name would ring down the ages whether I had been his dwarvish helped me or not, the melancholy washes in which I almost smothered some of his songs were involuntary, a byproduct of my in measurable gloom and the confined space of the chalet, together with a certain suggestibility in binders character, particularly when I placed him in a hypnagogic state using Trixie methods as employed by some of the great Carpathian mind benders of my childhood years. Which brings us neatly to the third of the five last songs, the middle one known as the song of the Carpathian mind benders. The score calls for three singers, a pair of tubers, a fiddle and saw and thousands upon thousands of handbells. The word to deliberately senseless, the music both frightening and gorgeous, 45 minutes it is by far the longest of the five songs, though all but two of those minutes consists of cacophonous, yet deeply melancholy bell ringing in his lifetime, binder steadfastly refused to allow a truncated version of the song without the bells to be performed. Since his death, mischievous maestro's, insufficiently or struck by the binder legend of chanced it, only to find that audiences boo and throw tomatoes and walk out of concert halls on mass. There is a persistent rumor put about by the more irresponsible binder is that the song was originally meant to end with the howl of a werewolf. Let it be said once and for all. This is the fourth song, on the other hand, does begin with howling but it's human howling, very human howling. It is the howl of a soul in torment, wrote the critic glib torment which, as the song progresses, evaporate, to be replaced by a fathomless sense of salud de torpor, as when one has eaten far too many boiled eggs at one sitting. This is a sound observation, and indeed, the song is now popularly known as the eggy breakfast song. Its proper title is happy at SU Fattah a pice that is a B has its destiny and enigmatic and possibly meaningless saying binder had had tattooed on his forearm. forearm during his unruly teenage years in cuxhaven. It's the most personal of the five songs The only one where binder wrote his own lyric, in which he evokes his childhood on the coast of cuxhaven. Staring at the sea until in shrouded by missed quite what bees and breakfast have to do with it is a mystery. And one the composer was happy to encourage binder could be a very mysterious man wrote passcode, particularly after eating too many eggs for breakfast. Sometimes his behavior was so Dotty, I had to inject him with one of my serums sometimes, CR Pascoe could be a very mysterious helpmeet. You will be familiar with the fifth and final song in the sequence as it has been wrenched from its context and covered by innumerable musicians, including Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, Kenny, the Explorer and plastic Bertrand. In fact, it's so well known that it hardly seems worth talking about for the rest of his life

binder was able to live comfortably on the royalties earned from this one song. When the first check arrived in the post, wrote Keira Pascoe, he immediately strode out of the chalet and down the mountainside to town and went to the bank and cashed it and bought a shiny new poppo phone. And thus was born the germ of the Sinfonietta for shiny new papo phone and broken eggs. It's not binders best loved work. Indeed, it's quite unlistenable, but many would argue and have done in the pages of obscure music journals to be found in the waiting rooms of culturally superior dentists. That it was with this piece that the B binder found his own destiny.

I mentioned the the website the dabbler earlier, and the this piece is from keys cupboard at the dabbler last week or the week before go and have a look. Anyway, here it is. Imagine you're a euro peasant of the Middle Ages to keep you in your place and to ensure you do not get any funny ideas. The church vaults its power over you both temporal and spiritual in ways designed to stand your Pew medieval mined cathedrals can still sometimes dominate a modern city skyline. So how much grander and awe inspiring they must have seemed when they dwarfed every other building around them, and the treasures inside bright colors, gold and silver, precious stones, glorious riches, contrasting so sharply with the filth and muck of your own pitiable peasant existence. Much of the art of course, didactic pictures for the illiterate, shared symbolism, easily understood even by the thick headed. And that's why you see, when Crusaders returned from the crusades, bringing all sorts of Exotica from far distant land, it was obvious what to do with those embalmed crocodiles they carried home. Clearly such a monster as the crocodile was Titanic, the spawn of hell. Thus, were crocodiles wrapped in chains and hung from the ceilings of churches and cathedrals, to impress upon the peasants. Both the awful power and the ineffable mystery of Christ. fretful about its evaporating congregations, perhaps the Church of England could revive this very sensible practice.

Frank Key  26:45
And that's the end of this week's hooting out on the air. I was going to read you a recipe by Christopher smart, author of the true bollati agno for bubble and squeak, but that can wait till next week. The stuff about the crocodiles in bombed crocodiles hanging chains from the ceilings of churches and cathedrals in the Middle Ages is of course, as with the monkey house incident, entirely factual. I didn't make it up. In fact, I never really make anything up everything you hear on this program is based on fact. Yeah, yes. And I'll be back next week with more of the same I hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to gum by impugned by a peasant and Other Stories 300 odd pages 114 stories and a fantastic photograph of a peasant on the cover. Bye bye
