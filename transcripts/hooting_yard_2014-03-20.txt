Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. Usually on this show, if you've, if you're a regular listener, you'll know that I've read sweeping passages of majestic prose that I have written myself. But I'd like to read something different this week. I've had a bulging postbag recently thousands of letters, all of them saying pretty much the same thing. So I thought rather than reading all of the letters out, I just read one. Because it's the all the other letters say pretty much the same thing. This is from Tim thurn, who writes Dear Mr. Key, everything I know about ornithology, I have learned from you, for which you have my undying gratitude. However, I still feel I would like to know more, a lot more about our feathered friends. Perhaps you could give your listeners the further benefit of your matchless ornithological knowledge. passionately yours, Tim thurn. So, that's what I'm going to do.
