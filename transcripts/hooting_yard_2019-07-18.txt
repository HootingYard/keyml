Good evening. This is resonance follow 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key This is hooting yard on the air and I'm going to entertain you with Pros for the next 28 and a half minutes or so. And I'm not accompanied today by pansy cradle drew pens, so there's no live knitting. Unfortunately. Pants pansies had to go to a shindig, early evening shindig but a shindig nevertheless. But anyway, let's get on with it. Dobson and marigold crew were up in the mountains. Dobson was wearing an ill advised cravat, while marigold Chu sported a brand new leopard skin pillbox hat. They were in pursuit of a murderer reported to have taken refuge in the mountains. Their purpose was to persuade the murderer to repent his killing spree. They had no interest in bundling him back down from the mountains to face earthly justice. They simply wanted him to repent. The murderer was babinski heavy of moustache and lumbering of gait. He had proud the streets of pointy town in darkness before a botched slaying. Excuse me. Before a botched slaying panicked him and he took to the mountains. The mountains were teeming with bears. Many, many, many of the bears were afflicted with lupus, a particular form of earth sign lupus, common in that mountainous region. You might think that lupine animals like wolves would be more prone to lupus than Earth sign animals like bears. But as I just pointed out, this was a strain of earth sign lupus, not lupine the lupus. There were a few wolves in the mountains, but they were for the most part tremendously. hale and healthy wolves. lupus neither earth sign nor lupine. But human is an account of very popular disease in the television medical drama house, MD. You intriguingly Dobson and marigold crew had arranged their trip to the mountains by buying tickets from a travel agency named foreman Cameron and chase. These are the names of Dr. house's young assistance and a further twist, so improbable that it could almost be fictional. The conductor on the train that brought them to the station at the mountain foothills with a man called Cuddy Wilson. caddy and Wilson are as it happens, the other two main characters in house MD. Not only that, but with his huge lagoo breus mustache and lumbering gait. The train conductors resemblance to the killer babinski was startling. They had been an unfortunate incident on the train in the dining car. When a gung ho Dobson had removed his ill advised cravat and tried to shovel it into the conductor's mouth to incapacitate him and place him under arrest, thinking he was babinski. This was despite the warning words of marigold to alert to one or two subtle features of Cuddy Wilson's physiognomy, which differed from that of the fugitive maniac. Thompson was lucky not to be thrown off the train, for it so happened, but the conductor was an adept of goon Fang, and he had no trouble at all disarming Dobson of the ill advised cravat and crumpling him into the hopeless, helpless posture known as Pong gak Hoon, in which he spent the remainder of the journey. Thus, upon arrival at the mountain foothills, the out of print pamphleteer was unable to think straight because he had missed his breakfast and valuable hours were lost. He insisted on stopping at a snack bar way stuffed himself with promoters and Special K and sausages.

Let us treat ourselves to a bird's eye view of the terrific mountains. If we imagine were hovering directly above them, hundreds of feet in the air, at Cloud level perhaps, we can draw a triangle between three points, call them a B and C. At a, we have the snack bar in the foothills, wherein we find Dobson and marigold to be we have an encampment of mountain bears, many stricken with a sign lupus. And let's see the killer babinski. taking shelter in a declivity that might be a crevasse high in the mountains, examining the content of his knapsack packed in a panic as he made his getaway from pointy town. Had bubinski had Dobson's uncharacteristically useful pamphlet, never pack a knapsack in a panic out of print. He would not have been in the pickle in which he now found himself. dumpster Dobson did not write the pamphlet specifically to advise homicidal fugitives from earthly justice who had fled into the mountains and the majority of tips, and it's 20 pages of a more general application. Indeed, one of the few positive reviews the pamphlet ever received in his lifetime came from a gnosis in big sturdy boots, the Journal of the budget spinny hiking club, whose anonymous critic praise the pamphlet for it, quote, judicious good sense and greaseproof paper wrapping. Unquote. The writers only caveat was Dobson's exclusive use of the word knapsack, which was felt could cause offence to those who preferred the terms have a sack and rucksack. Younger listeners should note that in those days, they barbaric backpack had not yet solid the language. So their points see the disconsolate babinski rummaged among the items, he had packed panic stricken into his knapsack. Instead of useful things like a compass and pemmican and string. He found that he had a paperback Gazetteer of sorry. Instead of useful things like a compass and pemmican and string, he found that he had a paperback Gazetteer of bassoon clot shot, a tattered pin cushion, innocent two pins, from which half the stuffing had fallen out. A photograph of a pig, to corks an unpaid gas bill, a bad from Richard Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. When he ran against Hubert Humphrey, several small and purposeless cloth pods are rusty whisk, a paper bag full of bent or otherwise damaged fountain pen nibs. The packaging from a black pudding here Deaton just before he killed the tooth was a vagrant of pointy town. Hair dye, a plasticine Starling much dust a cardboard rag or a cardboard tag or tab or label on which some unknown functionary had scribbled the word pointless. a beaker caked with mold another beaker with a gash in his base, a sleeveless and warped 12 inch picture disc of Vienna. It means nothing to me by Ultravox whittles twigs, scrunched up dick cloth than normal bones of a weasel, or possibly a squirrel feathers. A pictorial guide to cephalopods, someone else's illegible addressbook an empty carton of no egg, more dust, more feathers, more bones, and a syringe containing a goodly amount of earth sign lupus antidote. Having neatly laid out all this rubbish on a ledge in the declivity or cravat where he squatted babinski stuffed it all back into it. knapsack made the knapsack a pillow may splayed out on his back and fell asleep. Meanwhile, over at point b on our triangle, the many many many bears both those with a sign lupus and those without. We're also fast asleep

and had been for some hours. It was as if they had been engulfed by some sort of narcoleptic gas. But those with knowledge of the mountains and of the mountain bears would tell you that there was nothing to worry about. It was simply a case of an encampment of sleeping bears high in the mountains, who would eventually Wake Up. Down in the foothills, village folk might tell stories about the mysterious experiment going on in the pneumatic institution for inhalation gas therapy, but they knew not where have they spoke for they were peasants rather than scientists. And thus, their expertise was in such matters as slurry and pigs will and barnyard maintenance rather than an exciting gas activity. In any case, by skipping along to point a one would find Dobson and marigold crew in the snack bar, wide awake and intently planning their next steps in tracking down the killer babinski and making him repent. Ever resourceful marigold true, I brought her ogs be steering panels to facilitate the search. neither she nor Dobson could be said to be natural mountaineers, both of them more home on flat surfaces, such as ice rinks and tidal planes. Yet they had a sense of overwhelming duty to make the killer repent, preferably on his knees, or sprawled on the ground in a posture of abject groveling, not unlike the goon Fang posture. Pon Jacques Hoon, from which Dobson was only just recovering with the help of the tremendous snack bar breakfast menu. So enthusiastically was he stuffing his gob. But marigold crew began to wonder if a paramour would be too bloated, to clamber in sprightly fashion up into the mountains before nightfall. She was well aware, even if Dobson was not, but at nighttime. These mountains were both eerie and perilous for all those years ago. She had paid attention in the prefabricated school room where Miss hoodoo brass taught the important key stage for spritely clambering in mountains at night learning module. And it will be not stars flattered and Moonstruck before the three corners of our triangle are each set in motion and begin ever so slowly, but implacably to converge upon each other. The triangle twisting warping like bubinski Ultravox record, shrinking Dobson, and marigold to the killer babinski, and many, many, many bears, including those stricken with a sign lupus will meet in the most desolate hour of the night. up in the mountains at a spot we can call point D. and here at point D, as if we're waiting them back firmly into the hard compacted snow stands an upright cylinder of reinforced Plexiglas sealed with a rubber cork. It is one of a number of cylinders placed here and there in the mountains by boffins from the pneumatic institution for inhalation gas therapy. And as the peasant down in the foothills could tell you, as they pause in their doings with slurry and pigs for barnyard maintenance, only the devil knows what some of these boffins are up to. And as I can tell you, even though I am no devil, they were rogue elements among the boffins bad boffins and one such boffin had just yesterday, filled the cylinder at point D, with a new and terrible and loathsome gas, which went on cocked wood fell all living things within a 20 yard radius, crumpled them as if they had been placed in the pawn gak Hoon, posture, beloved goon Fang adept, like the bubinski double train conductor Their brains would be modified in gruesome and unseemly ways.

And then as the gas dispersed into the clear mountain air, as dawn broke, each of them would awaken Dobson and marigold to the killer babinski and many, many bears, including those stricken with earth sign, lupus. Each of them the world would seem raw, different, alive with new Tangs and hues and vapors. And the three points of the triangle would slowly move apart relentlessly forever, as if they had never ever converged.

This is a piece of autobiography balloons in the sky On the morning when I decided to mesmerize a swarm. I had been thinking of doing so for some time for months. In fact, the idea of having so savage your bird as a swan within my power in thrown me. Gerrard man, Manley Hopkins famously mesmerized a duck on the 27th of April 1871. But I was going to go one better and transfer a large white this one. I filled my pockets with pebbles and pranced towards the pond, where I fully expected to find a few swans spawning about one of which I would choose as my mesmeric subject swan. I looked up at the barrage balloons, wondering why there were so many of them in huddles just below clouds level was that the correct altitude for barrage balloons? I knew not. I had neglected this morning to wash my hair. And I'm afraid to say that it was disgustingly greasy as a consequence. And a further consequence was that as I made my way towards the pond, I was good at by a little tangle of hoodies who Excuse me.

Frank Key  17:45
I always dreamed that

Frank Key  17:54
right? I was jeered at by a little tangle of hoodies who used the grittiness of my hair as a pretext to abuse a mock me. I suspect that had I washed my hair, they would have lit upon some other feature, my carried or my garments, or the scars on my face where I had been bitten by birds. Now I've always found that the most effective way to deal with hoodies and similar riffraff is the visit upon them sudden ferocious and inexplicable violence, so packed with pebbles in my pockets, but I had no room that morning for hand grenades or pepper sprays or petrol soaked rags, so my usual avenues of hoody terrorizing, were closed. Instead, I ran up them whirling my arms and screeching as loud as a center of bitterns. The bitter end is one of the noisiest birds in the avian panoply, and it's loud, booming call is one of the furthest traveling of all Both songs. The male calls relentlessly both day and night from deep within his reedbed hoping to attract a female into his territory. My purpose of course, was to repel rather than to attract and in this I was successful. The hoodies fled from me, as I expect, you would have done for when I'm frightening, I am very, very frightening indeed. Can composing myself I turned back to the path and continued towards the pond. It was a fine pond as pawns go the shape of a frying pan when viewed from above, as I had viewed it many times, from hot air balloons and aerostat it is many years now since I have been a loft. My physician identified a particular substance in my head which throbbed and became inflamed before travel much above sea level. So I took her advice, moved to a flat part of the country and with some regret curtail my aerial exploits. I feared that my close study of birds would be in jeopardy. Now I was forced for medical reasons to hunker close to the ground. But it soon became apparent that I still had numberless orner for logical opportunities. Given that many birds stick pretty close to the ground themselves, a lot of the time swans among them to my utmost dismay, upon arrival at the pond, I saw no swans at all. This was most unusual, but I rapidly connected the absence of swans to the sight of black and yellow police tape, real all the way around the pond fastened to what I hoped with temporary perpendicular metal poles. Sometimes police tape is blue and white, and sometimes, as on this occasion, it is black and yellow. My eyes or fancy has always been that the latter colors are picked by a police be enthusiast, but I'm sure there is a less sensible reason. I certainly wanted to know the reason for the appearance of the tape. On the very morning when I plan to mesmerize a swan and I looked around for a police officer whom I could bombard with questions on the far side of the pond, I was delighted to see PC Nesbitt, who was known to me personally, we belong to the same branch of the beige cardigan and trousers club and often sat within shouting distance of each other at Club picnics. I shouted at him now using my bittern boom, though in a friendlier way than I had deployed it against the hoodies. And I saw PC Nisbett cover his ears in shock. My large irregular is the man had, if he had been unfortunate enough to be born in an earlier and more brutish age is is would surely have been exhibited by a mountebank for money. I think he must have had a specially modified police helmet to accommodate them. But if so it was a very clever modification, not apparent to a casual observer.

Frank Key  22:38
I did not want to have to boom my catalogue of questions across the pond. So I began walking around it towards the PC. And he too began walking in his policeman leeway towards me. So we met up halfway there where where there was a kiosk selling refreshments. I plumped for a ton of sculpture. And PC Nisbett, who confessed to being peckish bought a tub of boiled fish paste. We settled on a bench next to the kiosk, but before I could ask him about the police tape, and the absence of swans, he remarked upon the disgusting grittiness of my hair, and I had to explain that gone on wash that morning, as I was pressed for time. After upgrading me and giving a long winded alarm about the dangers of excess grease in the hair, it began babbling about the barrage balloons, which still loomed in the sky above us. I was impatient to change the subject. But PC Nisbett was a fiendishly difficult man to interrupt, for he never seemed to need to pause for breath, the words tumbling out of his mouth, one after another, like bats from a cave. Somehow, he was managing to eat his boiled fish paste at the same time, which made his jabbering even harder to understand than usual. I began to despair and wonder if I could stop him by pretending to swoon so I dropped my sculpture and toppled off the bench into the market the pawns edge. This had the desired effect, although it meant that the grease in my hair was now mingled with mud beetles and slime. Why is police type reeled around the pond and where are the swans, I wrapped as I clambered back onto the bench. PC Nesbitt took a deep breath and elaborated. He told me that a terrible crime had been committed. And shortly shortly forensic officers in skin diving equipment would arrive to drag the pond. The swans had been removed to what he called a place of safety. I wanted to know whether this was so I could pursue my Swan mesmerize ation plan without further delay, but PC Nesbitt claimed not to know. Before dawn he said a squadron of bird management officers trained in Swan removal techniques have descended upon the pond and removed the swans using the technique in which they had been trained. But whether swans had been removed to an F or when they would ever be returned to the pond, and if indeed, the place of safety was truly safe for swans, there these were matters it was thought best not to divulge to an ordinary copper from these fantastic is to his unstoppable jabbering. There was little it was ordinary about PC Nesbitt, but I took his point. If I were put in charge of a pond crime and attendance one removal, I would not see the need to tell every last detail of the operation to a lowly functionary. But clearly, I need to eat from PC Nesbitt, the name and whereabouts of the officer in charge of the case. After much more babbling, I learned that this was detective Captain kargh pan or that he was at that very moment back at the station, roughing up a malefactor. I believe PC Nisbett farewell and set off hot foot for the station. I was passed out when I got there. And when I slumped against the front desk was outraged to find myself placed under immediate arrest by the desk sergeant, a florid character with the eyes of a pig and the nose of a crow. I protested that I was a fine upstanding member of the local community, and that committee member of the beige cardigan trousers club to no avail, snapping a pair of manacles on me and shoving me into a cell. The florid Sergeant told me he was arresting me for entering a police station with grease, mud beetles and slime in my hair, and fur, probably having something to do with the appearance of untold numbers of barrage balloons in the sky that morning. My request to send a desperate heartfelt message to David Blunkett by metal Tapping Machine was met with a punch on the side of my head. This dish lodged at least one of the Beatles for my hair, as the cell door clang shot. The next paragraph begins, what a predicament

Frank Key  27:41
and in a timely fashion. We're going to leave that hanging there as a sort of exciting cliffhanger, that's what they called Yes, that's the word, a cliffhanger to next week show, when we will find out how the narrator sorry me because this is an autobiographical piece, how I got out of the predicament. So until next week, I hope you've enjoyed the show. I think I've enjoyed reading it. And I'll be back to re read ri recall how I got out of that predicament next week. This is resonance 104 point four FM, hooting out on the air bye bye
