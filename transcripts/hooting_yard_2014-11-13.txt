Boy,

Frank Key  00:01
this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frankie This is hooting out on the air. After my debauchery is in the fleshpots of the East, I sort of further debauchery is in the flesh parts of the West. I was cited for a time, but then I grew restless and discovered fresh debauchery in the fleshpots of the South. Sometimes late sometime later, I went north, but in the north I found no fleshpots just ice and snow and bitter gales and storms so cold my eyelids were frozen shut, and I could not see. I stumbled about blind upon an ice floe, and heard of the ominous grunting of bears. The wind was howling, and my brain was howling, but I made no sound from my frozen lips were blue, and fused together. This was not the death I had foreseen. I had imagined myself a dissolute voluptuary sprawled on a divan, my berry full of wine, Keeling over suddenly and unknowingly. The only sign of my passing would be when the resident band brought some hot Cardinals jazz number to an end, and began to play a few nariyal dirge. Instead, I was alone and cold in a blizzard of whiteness, about to be more than eaten by bears I could not even see. Then, oh, joy, I heard the clatter of a helicopter above, and soon enough, I would hold the board to safety. When my eyelids toward enough to open, I saw that my savior was Carruthers. Carruthers caruthers, my old maka from long ago, before my debauchery is in the fleshpots of the east and west and south caruthers to whom I had confessed back then, that the pounding of those infernal drums was driving me mad. caruthers who comforted me when I went to pieces in the tropics, now, here he was, again, at the controls of the helicopter. You came much too far north, he said, really briefly removing the pipe clamp between his manly drawers. You must have overshot the fleshpots on your journey. There are indeed Northern fleshpots I shall take you straight to them so you can continue with your boundaries. No, I cried. As soon as my lips have thought sufficiently to allow me to open my mouth. I have learned a valuable moral lesson in the inhospitable bleakness of the ice Gert north. From this day on Nigel Sham debauchery is of all kinds, and devote my life to proper manly pursuit. Just keep me away from those drums and their infernal pounding. Carruthers nodded. And with that, he changed course, and took me to some corner of the earth with overcast skies and light breezes, mild and with occasional drizzle, temperate, temperate, and free of all temptations.

And that, of course, was an autobiographical piece as many of the pieces on hooting Jada history now. Do you know how the 1848 revolutions in Europe began? Would you like to know? Then I will tell you. I will tell you in the words of Rupert Davenport Hines, who reviewed a recently published book called Phantom terror, the threat of revolution and the repression of liberty 1789 to 1848. And in this review, he there's a paragraph which explains basically, how the revolutions of 1848 began. zamoyski that's the author of the book is adept at painterly scene setting. One vivid paragraph shows the Paris revolution of 18 48 which sent King Louie Phillipe scurrying into exile and ignited populist interactions across Europe as caused by a clumsy band's man with a big drum. After a day of innocuous anti climactic Paris demonstrations, a company of soldiers stationed on a Boulevard corner tried to retreat from a rowdy but hardly murderous crowd into the courtyard of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. By what blocked because the musician carrying the drum got jammed in the poor share of the ministry. As a result, some soldiers had to turn and face the crowd grew rattled and fired shots that left over 30 dead. The mangled corpses were piled onto a wagon which was traveled through the streets of Paris by rabble rousers crying for revenge. It was the drama rather than the previous uprisings in Palermo and Naples, and the granting of constitutions in Sicily, Sardinia and Tuscany that triggered the continent wide uprisings of 1848.

See, such an educational show, hooting yard you get an insight into the past life of Mr. Key and you get, you know, important details of European history. What next? I wonder what next? Well, for some considerable time, I have been keeping track of kneebone hooft. There is a map of the world on the wall of my study, into which I have stuck many many pins. That color coded pinky red for possible sightings, ready red for probable sightings, and blood red for definite and incontrovertible sightings. In certain lights, particularly towards evening, the Reds look identical on this gives me a certain comfort. Each of the blood red definite sightings of schneeberg hooved is accompanied by a photograph, usually a snapshot taken hastily with a concealed camera. These are pinned up on the wall next to the map of the world. With a post it note attached to the edge of each photograph, giving details of date and location and were known the name of the agent who took the snap. Many of my agents are unwilling to divulge their identities. I used to make use of a system of aliases based on an alphabetical list of seaside entertainers of the interwar years. But I became too interested in the entertainers and spent far too much of my time tracking down old end of the pier variety theatre ephemera instead of cracking down what I was charged with tracking down, which was Schneeberger moved. As far as I have been able to gather schnee Baum hoofed was never employed in any kind of capacity as an entertainer. It is laughable to think of him on stilts, for example, or having a custard pie splurged into his face by an accomplice. And yet, that is how he appears to me in my dreams. Sometimes he is singing a humorous song or doing some business with a couple of napkins and a budgerigar, while an audience of working class daytrippers from grim industrial hellholes roll with laughter or gasp in wonderment before breaking into applause. Clapping punctuated with whoops and cheers. When I wake from these dreams, I go into my study and gaze at the wall, and I am reminded that there has not been a single sighting of schneeberg hoofed anywhere near the seaside. For some considerable time I have been wondering why schneeberg hoofed is so terrified of the sea. The sea is never still it is vast and it is merciless. Perhaps that is why

Frank Key  10:16
A little bit more autobiography now I'm sorry to blather on about myself, but you know how it is sometimes that's what you got to do in the age of narcissism. I'm half Irish, on my father's side. And I thought being up being Irish or at least half Irish, I obviously must have some gift for poetry. I mean, all Irish people can write poetry comedy. So I decided to write a standard Irish poem, which I'd like to recite to you now. I can see my father now, with his spade, digging up potatoes in a field as rain pours down, then trudging back his boots in the muck, to the filthy cottage, where my mother clutches her rosary beads, and prays to the blessing virgin for more rain and more potatoes to feed the visiting priest.

Unknown Speaker  12:09
Yeah,

Frank Key  12:09
that's I mean, that could be Seamus Heaney, couldn't it? In fact, it almost is Seamus Heaney. The late lamented Seamus Heaney, for whom my sister Once added acted as a babysitter. We're not Seamus Seamus, his babies, baby or babies. And that's a nother story. While I really don't know much about magic, Strudwick, magic Strudwick where Gallus thau I'm going to the barn for to milk me a cow match. Strudwick magic Strudwick. What will you do? Then?

You'd be surprised how many people around the world appreciate sausages. That wasn't me that was someone on farming today on radio four. BBC Radio four said that he didn't. He didn't go on to say anything else about it. So I'm really not sure what it means, but I thought you'd like to know. A couple of years ago I had reason to mention a crevasse wangka today while Well, not today, last last month while solving the Guardian crossword, I was reminded of that rather more charming figure of the mountaineering world. Gertrude tranport, known as the crevasse poppet 16 down three down. Gertrude earn this soubriquet because she was a sort of one woman Mountain Rescue Service adapter, saving the lives and whims of hapless mountaineers who, not looking where they were going, plummeted down crevasses to what would otherwise have been certain death.

Frank Key  16:53
One of the great mysteries of the crevasse poppet was the manner in which he affected her rescues, a skewing the usual kit of ropes and patterns and Titans and whatever else is used by standard mountain rescue teams. She employed a form of inexplicable mesmerism standing at the edge of a crevasse where in languished a moaning ninny who had fallen in some minutes earlier. Gertrude would make enigmatic sweeping movements of her arms, while babbling gibberish and gazing at the sky. By this means, she somehow levitated the net, which out of the cravat, at least, that's what she told the Commission of Inquiry when it was considering whether to prosecute her for witchcraft. She was such a charming puppet that the case was dropped. Anyway, the crossword is particularly in dreaminess was particularly ingenious that died because it was littered with references to her story. The chairman of the chem mission, for example, was an unromantic, taciturn let 23 across, one down 24 across named Arpad Kling Klang. Arriving for the first session on his horse nine across, he gave a press conference, where he stated that he was ready to burn through Trump waters or wick immediately given the in his view, it was a clear case of possession 11 across by old Nick 10 across the crevasse puppet had only been on the witness stand for a few minutes However, before the lead was like a Moonstruck cough, hopelessly in love. Soon enough, he called proceedings to a halt, put all the paperwork through a shredder five down and was persuaded to take a rest cure 26 across at a seaside resort, seven down where he spent his time drinking cafe Noir, a to cross dancing the habanero 20 across with various ladies 22 across and poring over erotica 17 across. In an attempt to rid him of his Gertrude mania, the staff fed him a diet of gruul containing bits of leak to down and locust 22 down. There are several Alpine folk songs about the crevasse poppet usually yodel to the accompaniment of an output horn. If you listen to them, you probably need to take a rest cue yourself.

Frank Key  20:38
I was excited to note in the television listings that I think over this weekend there's a rare screening. One afternoon of film called radon and tabet which is about a raid on a retired conservative cabinet minister. not related to the raid on Entebbe, which is a completely different film. Speaking of Norman Tebbit, I just like to remind you that some years ago, one of the great headlines of our time appeared in the papers, which was Norman Tebbit attacks child in Dragon outfit, which apparently, was, of course a true story. Just to be clear, it was a child who was dressed in the dragon outfit, and not Norman Tebbit, which I suppose is a construction you could put on the headline. But how this happened embarrassing Edmonds apparently it was trial making too much noise from Norman Tibbets liking and he was it was the tail, the tail most part of a dragon, multi person dragon puppet. And even though he's quite elderly now, Norman Tebbit was so annoyed by the noise that he ran across towards the the dragon and gave it a good kicking. And the end of them ended up kicking this child. Anyway, what a headline. Norman Tebbit attacks child in Dragon outfit. Enough of that I was sprawled on the sofa dozing off as I read the latest issue of the truncation of truth, when I was startled by an urgent pounding at the door. Come in, I shouted for the door was not locked. As I tossed my magazine onto the floor and prepared to rise to greet my visitor, whoever it was. The door crashed open, and a man wearing a frock coat and a bippity boppity hat came striding in. I immediately recognized him was Tarleton the amateurs amateur. Why, as I live and breathe, it is you Tarleton I yelled. Strictly speaking, none of these words was actually necessary. spamming your unnecessary words wrapped tahltan Put on your coat and hat and boots and follow me there is not a moment to lose. Last began one of the more thrilling Adventures of my lawn and for the most part, undistinguished life. I had no idea at the time that I was to play a significant part in what became known as the affair of the middle European Crown Prince, the missing jewelry box, the DAX and the drainage ditch, and the freckle face lighthouse keeper. On that sopping wet Sunday morning, I was preoccupied with the fact that Talton had interrupted my reading of an article in the truncheon of truth on the subject of Blunkett. I was in the middle of reading a very interesting piece about David Blunkett, I protested to Tarleton as I hastened after him along the rain swept streets of my bailiwick, Save your breath, man wrapped Talton and keep up there is not a moment to lose. We turned down an alleyway next to the ice cream kiosk, and then down another alleyway, and another, and yet another, until I realized that I was no longer firm in my familiar surroundings, and had no idea where I was, in spite of the fact that each alleyway was narrower and darker and more fetid than the last tiles and kept up a cracking pace. At the point where you knocked I pound I painted blanket or just enter the field. We're in a cow awaited him a cow that I think was about to attack him and on his birthday to boot. You looked as if you were dozing off when I Arrived sent tahltan so you cannot have found the article that interesting. Now harsh, he added and he made a melodramatic gesture, placing one silk big gloved finger vertically in front of his lips, which stood soaked in front of a doorway in which the paint was peeling. The wood was rotting on the number 49 had been scratched as if by the claws of a maddened

Unknown Speaker  25:25
bear.

Frank Key  25:28
I was dozing off because the prose was leaden, I said, but the content in itself was absolutely fascinating. For God's sake harsh, his tahltan and as he did so, he pushed the door open gingerly. It creaked on it hinges, nevertheless, follow me down this secret corridor, he whispered. The Secret corridor was unlit, and when the doors swung shut behind me, I was blind this blanket in the pitch blackness. recording the article in the truncheon of truth, I apprehended just how terrifying it would be, to be attacked by a cow. I groped forward and clutched at the tail of tausend frock coat, and we stumbled forward in the Stygian gloom. We're not likely to meet with a cow. I take it, I whispered, towels and hushed me for the third time. In blackness and silence, like the message of Sylvia Plath, you tree, we made our way along the secret corridor for what seemed to me untold hours, but was when I looked later, my wristwatch only a few minutes, we emerged eventually, into the large and imposing pantry of a large and imposing hotel. And now I was Blunkett blinded, not by darkness, but by the glare of several Klieg lights tahltan ever prepared, ever prepared, snapped on a pair of sunglasses. We are only just in time, he cried. They're chained to the pantry wall, gagged and disheveled with a middle European Crown Prince, and on the floor at his feet, and missing jewelry box. With one swift and decisive move, Talton, smashed a change with an axe. Then he helped the Crown Prince to his feet, pocketed the jewelry box, dusted down his frock coat, straightened his before the poverty hat on his head, and prepared to leave the pantry through a connecting door to a second equally large and equally imposing pantry from where we could make our way to the hotel lobby, and then out into daylight and safety and the majestic Boulevard. As I made to follow tahltan turned wag the silk big gloved finger in my face, and said, white here. I never saw Talton or the middle European Crown Prince again. I kept myself occupied in the pantry, rearranging the pots and pans and packet soups on the shelves, and doing a little light dusting. Until one day we can buy hunger. I saw a hallucinatory cow intent on attacking me, and I realized it was time to leave. I made my way back through the secret corridor, and out into the alleyway and the other alleyway, and the other alleyway and the other alleyway, until I got my bearings, and made my way home. Several weeks copies of the truncheon of truth were piled up on the doormat. I made myself an infusion of boiled lettuce, water, and sprawled on the sofa to catch up on my reading. There was an article recounting in great detail, the affair of the middle European Crown Prince, the missing jewelry box, the DAX and the drainage ditch, and the freckle face delight housekeeper. Tarleton was not mentioned or nor was I, at least, not in the first few paragraphs. The piece was written in prose. So leaden that before I read any further, I dozed off. I was startled by an urgent pounding at the door, but I had taken the precaution of locking it, and I ignored the pounding, and went back to sleep. And that's the end of this week's show. And I'm not going to go to sleep. I'm going to go home. And I'll be back next week. And I'll tell you a lot a lot of things about janitors. Now.
