Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. I'm very pleased this week to have not only my as usual, a very helpful engineer who make sure you can hear this, but in the studio we also have an Undertaker's mute who will now greet you. And the other day I read, I found out an interesting fact that Jim Jones, the cult leader of the People's temple, who are the ones who committed mass suicide, or possibly murder in 1978, or 79. Early in his life when he was setting up as a preacher man, and trying to get his church going, Jim Jones, worked as a door to door monkey salesman, which quite interested me the idea of going door to door and trying to sell someone a monkey anyway inspired this. Given its title, one could be forgiven for thinking that Confessions of a doctor or monkey salesman is a 1970s British sex comedy film starring Robin Asquith. In fact, it's a Bildungsroman of fierce intensity. annoyingly, its author has chosen to remain anonymous. The book begins last. I was born in a cornfield. The first sound I heard was the shrieking of crows. My mother put me in a burlap sack and dropped me down a well and went on with her rustic drudgery. At the bottom of the well ran an underground stream. I was carried along for miles until the stream surfaced alongside and dilapidated pig farm. The pig farmer's wife was washing potatoes in the stream as I came by in my sack. Never want to waste a good piece of burlap. She plucked a sack from the stream and found me inside it. I was gurgling. We might think this far fetched we're not that there are many true tales of babies and hamsters, surviving journeys fraught with much more peril. The note about the crows is intriguing, reminding us of the old saying, I think from filth share. A child born to the coining of crows will have too few fingers and too many toes. And what do we learn on page 26? I remember quite clearly the night my adoptive pig farming mother read to me as a bedtime story passages from a book describing freakish human anomalies. There was a two headed boy and a girl with eight kidneys, a giant with yellow lips and a woman with upside down his eye. She closed the book at the end of a chapter on people with lobster claws, and I was falling into sleep. She whispered and you my cherished tiny one are a freakish anomaly with your two thumbs, seven fingers and 11 toes. I sprang up wide awake. Until then I had not noticed my irregularity. Of course I had counted my own fingers and toes many times as a way of passing the time on rain soaked pig farm afternoons. But being very short sighted. I've never looked at other people's hands and feet with any acuity. Shortly after this realization, the boy has bought his first pair of spectacles. The prescription is flawed for the corrective lenses are obtained from an optical rascal, and the world remains blurry and distorted. Our hero can still not see well enough to count the toes and fingers of others unless they shove their hands or feet right in his face. And he's too diffidence to ask. But he gains in a strength from his status as an anomaly. I read and reread my mother's freak book, poring over the details and fantasizing that I had more enigmatic qualities than were outwardly apparent. For example, because I was mad for eating nuts, any nuts I could get my hands on, I became convinced that I had the brain of a squirrel. I spent long hours in the woods near the pig farm talking to squirrels in a language I thought they might understand. I trained myself to quiver and tremble and doubt about as if I had the high metabolic rate of a squirrel. This behavior continued until my 31st birthday no longer a child but with little experience of life away from the dilapidated pig farm. The author of the confessions reports abruptly the cataclysmic change that occurred on that birthday.

my adoptive parents perished in the Munich air disaster. If I had won a raffle to attend the second leg of the European Cup quarterfinal between manchester united and Red Star Belgrade. It was the first time they had left me in sole charge of the pig farm. When the posty came up the line with the telegram telling me the terrible news. In my convulsive grief, I suddenly realized that I did not have the brain of a squirrel and never had had and that life held for me greater prospects than mucking about in the woods, babbling gibberish and knowing nuts. I was now the master of a dilapidated pig farm. Was he its master, or did the farm master him in the shape of the pigs. There were very few pigs left on the farm no more than half a size worth and they were belligerent cunning and rancorous. They were, in a way freakish anomalies themselves very different from the peaceable intelligent pigs were so fond of. For years, the deceased pig farmer and his wife had been adding a secret ingredients to their brand mash on the advice of a plausible pig feed rascal, a crony of the equally plausible optic rascal who had supplied our heroes defective spectacles. Quite what the pigs had been ingesting for decades is unclear, but it but it had wrought psychic pig havoc. They were more than a match for a mark for a myopic innocent, who was trying to adjust to his new life. Within weeks, charming bucolic dilapidation became after ruin. The last straw was a tempest, which flattened the barn and the pigsty and sheds and huts and outbuildings and even the farmhouse itself. The local newspaper described it as an unusual weather event. In the teeth of the storm, the pigs ran amok and vanished up in the hills. I sat on the Ottoman surrounded by collapse, fate decreed that a pig farmers life was not for me. I have a sudden urge to regress to return to the woods and commune with squirrels, but I fought it. My spectacles had been smashed during all the chaos, and I determined that as soon as the wind died down and there was daylight, I would seek out the optic rascal to get a new pair. Are credulity is strained somewhat when we're told that the only item to survive the devastation of the tempest. Apart from the Ottoman upon which he is sitting, is the narrator's dead adoptive pig farming parents hand compiled directory of countryside rascals, a ring binder, jam packed with details of hundreds of rustic chances, including full contact details, mug shots, handwriting samples, maps, and of course, their areas of persuasive or scality whether it be optics or pig feed, are much else besides, armed with such exhaustive information, even our short sighted hero could not fail to track down the rascal he sought. Or could he? I was two days distant from the rubble that had been my home. When sheltering under a sycamore tree from a southern shower. I appeared for what felt like the umpteenth time the sheet I had taken from the ring binder. My intention was to check that I was following the map accurately, and had remembered to the left after crossing sawdust bridge. Now holding the page the right way up, I suddenly discovered that I had mistakenly brought with me the information sheet not for the optic rascal, but for quite another rascal entirely, I suppose. Back at the obliterated pig farm, I must have been befuddled. I pondered whether I could cope without a new pair of spectacles before the interruption of the shower. It had been a sunny day, and I was in high spirits. After all, here I was on the open road, a free agent no longer tied down by pig farm responsibility. I could do as I pleased.

And I was coping well enough blundering about in a blur. I held the paper up close so I could read my dead adoptive pig farming mother's scroll. No doubt about it. I had the wrong sheet. It was headed monkey raskal, not optic rascal. I could not recall a time when a monkey rascal Harris had ever called it the pig farm. But my adoptive parents were resourceful folk, and they gathered details of sound rascals of whom they had no immediate need. The mask the monkey rascal was one such is information sheet compiled with care just in case his services might one day be required. As the rain spattered down around me, I wondered what those services were. He finds out soon enough, it takes just three more days trudging faithfully following the map for our hero to arrive and a monkey compound on the outskirts of a macabre village. wisely, he avoids going through the village itself, and bypasses it, taking a detour through a long muddy puddle pitted but not disagreeable ditch, the gate of the compound is unlocked. Though he can barely see in front of him. He hears the whistle of a steam kettle, and shortly afterwards, the telltale glog and clatter of cocoa preparation. Heading for the sound. He finds himself in the monkey compound canteen, where the monkey Rosco is holding court sipping cocoa and surrounded by monkeys. Our hero is in for a surprise. You must be the pig farmers adopted son, he said as soon as I blended through the canteen door, I've been waiting for you. He has given a cup of cocoa, and everything is explained. When I heard your parents had been killed in the Munich air disaster, I knew it was time for me to fulfill the pledge I made to them on the day you were hoisted out of the stream, he continued. I was there. I was about to sell the pig farmer and his wife a monkey when they found you. Instead, I must have looked peevish at the loss of a sale because they came over very guilt ridden that the thought of sending me away empty handed. So they said that so long as I was happy to keep hold of the monkey they had planned to buy, they would rent it instead. They paid me on the dot every month from that day until that tragic day in Munich. And as part of the monkey rental, they made me promise that should anything ever happened to them. I would take you under my wing and look after you until the day one of us died. That's why when you were asleep in a hedge a few nights ago, one of my trained monkeys took the optic rascals details out of your sacral and put mine in there instead. So here you are. He sounds like a splendid fellow doesn't he? But we must remember that he is as rascally a countryside rascal as all the other rascals in the directory of countryside rascals. It rapidly becomes apparent that he has concocted a plan. Yes, he will fulfill his pledge to care for our hero, but he expect something in return. And it is no small thing. That monkey rental money has kept my head above water these past 30 years. He went on, pausing now and then to slip into Coco. I sorely miss it. And these old bones of mine aren't getting any younger. I am mindful too that the woods here about two fairly riddled with squirrels, and I don't want you tempted to go down there and rekindle a squirrel brain nonsense your adoptive parents told me all about in the long tear stained letters they sent me with their monkey wrench checks. So I propose that in return for your cocoa and soup and a mattress in the monkey compound, you want to act as my very own indentured daughter or monkey salesman, starting at dawn and clocking off after nightfall every single day except saint Abad woes day he being the patron saint of monkeys, according to some, I hope you'll be pleasantly surprised at the number of householders willing to purchase a monkey there and then from a myopic stranger who bangs on their door out of the blue. Now finish your cocoa and you can get to work. And so begins a period of more than 20 years during which our hero pounds to the streets of villages and hamlets and towns and cities, a string of monkeys in tow, banging on the doors of people from all walks of life, high and low, professional and pro, refining his sales pattern, which grows in expertise, the more surely as his site fails, until towards the end, it is he who is led by the monkeys on a length of string, and then one day

one day it happened there was a mixup and a kindly retired Vicar who had taken a shine to Martin the howler monkey handed his cash to Martin and took me into his Vicarage by mistake. I've been here Happily Ever since fed on cornflakes and Brazil nuts and living in the overheated conservatory among dripping plants with fat bulging leaves. It's here I have written my confessions. From time to time I think of the monkey rascal, and how distraught he must have been when I did not come home that day. He must feel he has broken the pledge he made to my adoptive pig farming parents more than half a century ago. Or better through no fault of his own. I weep for him sometimes thinking of him in his canteen, perhaps with Martin at his side, howling. But then I snuffle and dry my eyes, and remember that he is a countryside rascal. Unlike all rascals, he will have other irons in the fire. I waved to the kindly retired Vicar through the conservatory window, and I chew another Brazil nut, and I pour another bowl of cornflakes down my throat.

It's not British summertime, so the evenings are lighter, but, you know, it still may be that you'll need something to occupy you on certain evenings. So here's a project. Give me a sieve or a riddle, and boy, oh boy. Before you can say lummi governor knocked me down with a feather. I'll have a pan of fine powder from which all a cloudy clumps have been winnowed. by pouring a little warm water into the pan from a bowl and stirring it with a stick, I will soon have a paste. And you know what, I can add dye to the paste to make it any color I like. It doesn't matter matter what color the power was originally. The next thing I can do is to make the paste a little tacky by adding a binding agent in 1859, William H. Gregory published Egypt in 1855 56, where he remarks inter alia that, quote, the rocky walls were black and sticky and seem to sweat a thick, fatty viscous liquor, unquote. That's precisely the kind of paste we want in our pan. Now we return to the sieve or riddle, which holds all the clumps that didn't make it through. The first thing to do is to remove them one by one and place them in a line on your countertop. sort them in order of size so that you have a row of clumps gradually ascending from tiny to Titanic. Of course, the tiniest of the clumps will not be too tiny for remember that what you have here are the leavings in the sieve. What I always do at this stage is to count the clumps, just to give me some idea of what lies ahead in terms of time and effort. Then I get a duster from the Duster drawer and very carefully swab all the clumps one by one wiping off any grime or filth from them. When this part of the process is complete, shake the dust violently over a bucket or pail to collect all the bits of unanswerable filth. However energetically you shake the Duster, some miniscule crumbs of dirt may cling to it. These can be removed by aiming a jet of fast rushing air from a nozzle over the whole surface of the Duster. pointing the jet in such a way that the last remnants of grubbing us for plop into the bucket or pail. If you've got this far with the project, give yourself a pat on the back or better get someone else to pat you on the back or to give you a bear hug. Try though not to be tempted to take a breather for a cup of tea and one of your trip Bosnian cigarettes. I make every effort to press right on fearing a lack of momentum. Maybe that's just me, you might be able to put your feet up and even take a nap, but I wouldn't risk it. Next, we wash our hands before pouring the viscous paste out of the pan into a clean bowl. We like paper towels out on the countertop. We grasp a pair of tongs. There are three basic classes of tongs to wit a tongs which have long arms terminating in small flat circular ends, and a pivoted close to the handle, as in the common fire tongs used for picking up pieces of coal and placing them on a fire. B tongs consisting of a single band of metal bent round one or two bands joined at the head by a spring, as in sugar tongs, a pair of usually silver tongs with claw shaped or spoon shaped ends for serving lump sugar or a sparrow Good tongs and alike and see tongs in which the pivot or joint is placed close to the gripping end, such as blacksmith tongs or crucible tongs. Which class of tongs you use, it's entirely up to you. I did not tell you what color to dye your paste, nor am I going to limit your choice of tongs. There are ancient freedoms, we must strain with all our might to protect. Starting at the end of the row of clumps where you place the tiniest clump, pick up the first clump with the tongs and dip it into the paste until it's coated, and then place it carefully on the paper towels. Relax the tongs and proceed to the next clump. Continue without pause until you've dipped and coated all the clumps with paste. Do not allow a squadron of Messerschmitt screaming across the sky to distract you.

While waiting for the clumps to dry, I take the opportunity to carry the bucket or pail full of filth to a municipal filth Depo where I up Turn the bucket or pail and empty it back home. Wipe the inside of the bucket or pail with a rag. Do not use one of your dusters. That is not what dusters are for. You now have a set of pasted clumps, each of which has too little and pasted patches where it was gripped by the tongs. There is likely to be a third anomalous patch after you've picked up the clump to place it in the bucket or pail. Given the viscosity of the paste. a shred of paper towel may remain stuck to the clump. Treasure this imperfection when all the clumps are gathered in the bucket or pail, I always feel like singing around a Gliese but you don't necessarily have to. What you must do is to take the bucket bucket or pail and place it in your porch. Nothing quite pulls a porch together as winningly as a bucket or pile of clumps covered in paste each clump with it two or three little unpainted patches. And if you don't believe me, consider this entry from the diaries of Lady chloride Skiffington PIP denizen of the cafe show off 28th Of March 19 Blanc, Dennis prong came to visit a company by his wolf hound and a cracked troop of snipers fresh from dispersing unseemly writers. I had hoped to treat them to tea and biscuits and lobster, but they spent the whole time shuffling around in the porch absolutely transfixed by my bucket or pile of clumps covered in paste in clump with it two or three little and pasted patches. It proved quite a hit. It was dark by the time they scuttled off. Despite the truthfulness of the porch time, I felt suddenly overcome with desolation and anguish and slumped on one of my carpets, sobbing, sobbing long into the night until distracted by a squadron of Messerschmitt screaming across the sky.

moving straight on so I can fit this in before the end of the show. Just take a sip of tea. That was my mug or turning to the counter question. When stricken with the poll z can one maintain a flamboyant demeanor? Answer as the recently elected POTUS might say yes, one can. Not only can one maintain flamboyant, but also poise. It's important to bear in mind that both these qualities and indeed many others, such as spark and dash and Erlang are innate and need not be corrupted by any paralysis of the limb or limbs. If as often happens, the paralysis is accompanied by violent and uncontrollable trembling, it can prove a tad more difficult to maintain one's flamboyance, but it's by no means an impossibility. Take for example, the case of that Magnifico we know as quintus perhaps just compositors the ancient world had its fair share of flamboyance and poise and spark and dash and a LAN. But seldom were all these attributes present in one man. From rooftops to arcades, to for the name of pastors was bruited about as a paragon. He may indeed have lacked virtue and horse sense, and he certainly never cut his martial chops. But his name was as it still remains a byword for flamboyance. A vivid portrait of him is drawn in the second of Pune these six panto pragmatic ons this depending on the type of radio or computer you're listening to this on, the next passage may or may not be audible. They're at the peak of his public esteem. Perhaps this was struck with the palsy. He was we're told in an arcade on a hot morning, cutting a dash, the cynosure of the city, when, as if struck by a bolt of lightning he crumpled to the paving. Born on a stretcher to a place of pallets. It was laid upon one and moved into cool and shade. Vestal nymphs suit his brow and a beard he herro specks was summoned, to prognosticate upon his case. By careful reading of the end trails of a freshly slaughtered hen. The Poles he was confirmed. Unless flamboyant Paragon might have withered away, consider crotas lapo. At one time, the arrival of pastors who, when felled by a debilitating au, was swiftly revealed to be a bore and a poltroon. All semblance of flamboyance deserted him, and he did indeed wither away. At the very end, his bones were tossed into the vast realist, and the metals on which his head appeared when melted down for horseshoes. Not so with quintus patch that compositors transferred from the palette onto a litter he had himself paraded through the city is weakened, tremulous limbs covered by a cloak that might have been thought gaudy where it not so flamboyant. He had his beard and Buffon preened and scented with undulant, and because his speech was not impaired, was able to dazzle the populace with his rhetoric and wrap our tea. This seldom made any sense, but his voice was sonorous and his delivery had great poise. Thus, he is the epitome of the polzeath flamboyant. Less distant in time we might look to the Victorian dandy over on wild badger forever in wrapped in a cloak as flamboyant as the one that once covered the palsy glimpse of hamsters, while badger is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a flop, but Fox rarely sprout mustachios as decisive as his, nor show such effortless poise when leaning against large important buildings. It is no doubt pertinent that he was the son of a brimstone and sulfur preacher of Reverend gentleman who shook the walls of 10 tabernacles with his frankly insane ravings, while badger learned much from his father, but not what the latter would have wished to teach his son. The young Oberon smirked at the content, but lapped up the style. So later, when he made his way in the world, he knew precisely how to make people gasp and even swoon merely by the flamboyance with which For example, He adjusted his cravat while bagger two was struck by the palsy, while dining on oysters and lobster at the cafe show off, slumping in his chair, his limbs limp and trembling, the trembling of his limbs not

yet set in as it would shortly and continue relentlessly for decades. The dandy merely raised an eyebrow and called the maitre D to his table to demanded his fluting voice, more oysters and an extra lobster. They were brought, but without the flamboyance he desired, so he sent the hapless waiter away to try again, back came the oysters and lobster carried on a guilt platter, but again, without the kind of dash and poise that while badger, even in his physical collapse, thought apt, other diners could not but be struck by his Lan, as he commanded the waiter back and forth until he was satisfied as the diarist lady chlorines skipping to Pip, who was present in the cafe wrote, rare is it to witness such flamboyant in one so palsy, we think we must go back as far as the ancient world and the example of quintus perhaps this compositors to be swoony with, or such poise, and spark and dash. And that's the end of this week's show. Bye bye
