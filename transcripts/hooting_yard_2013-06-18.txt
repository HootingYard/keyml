Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM on resonance fm.com. My name is Frankie and this is hooting out on the air. Live from London on what I learned shortly before coming on air is worldwide glistening day. I'm not sure who decided it's well listening day or what it is you meant to listen to, and what you're meant to be doing on the other 364 days of the year. But anyway, the assets world listening day, you can listen to me What a fantastic idea that is. I have a piece of paper in front of me, which may have been left here. Well, almost certainly was left here by someone who's been on the air earlier. And there's two questions on it. Which you might be familiar with if you've been listening. I haven't been listening. So I don't know. But there's two questions. One is, what's the science of it? And the other question is, earrings. So I don't know what that means, but it's highly amusing. And this is a good fat good found object, a sheet of a4 with two crashes or something written on the other side. I'm not gonna read that looks far too boring. Anyway. It's type that was handwritten. Anyway, on onwards with the show this week, I don't have any problems with Wi Fi so I don't have to babble incoherently for 10 minutes. Oh, how the past shrivels and vanishes, so we can scarcely believe it was ever quick and throbbing and so very alive. When we cast back, but 50 years, how hard it is to understand the passions that impelled us so recent forebears, who now would get in a tears about an issue that divided the nation half a century ago. Yet at the time, Qin was set against Qin men of the cloth fulminated from the pulpit. Always clash and strife. I speak of course of that great controversy. Button versus toggle. We may respond today with right tackles. few if any of us would now identify ourselves as exclusively button ears or toggle lists. But that's how it was then, for a brief but seizing period. The method you chose to fasten your coat took on fantastic importance. And you did wear a coat at all times in all weathers. It might have been a raincoat or a duffle coat. But you did not step out doors and cladding it many wore their coat indoors to the more fanatical those who sought to proclaim their button earring or toggle ism the loudest. It's instructive when we consider such historical flaps to consult the photographic evidence where that's possible. In this case, we're fortunate to have at least one riveting snap which shows how one family was caught up in the madness. Obviously, in the medium of radio, I can't show you that photograph. But I hope in what follows it's fairly well described and you can imagine it and if you want to imagine it further, the photograph bears a striking similarity to a still from the film The middle Caicos these are the four children of Mr. And Mrs. turpitude of shrubbery ness. From left to right, they are off OLG cos garden Urk what is immediately apparent is that oak is a button near and his brother IRQ a toggle list. Often cloudguard are partly hidden bow and their siblings, but nevertheless, clearly visible are two buttons off and one button cloth guard. What we have then, is the progeny of a single family Riven by the great controversy of the day.

further study of the snap raises all sorts of questions. We note the eerie countenances of the four tinies they're blank yet somehow threatening gazes. If we were to put The main order of malevolence from most malevolent to least we might say oh dog then irk then cloth guard then off. Obviously there is room for maneuver and where you wait may wish to swap them about. But what is playing is that each of their gazes is fixed upon the same target, out of shot next to or just behind the shoulder of the snapper. This is contrary to what we would expect, which would be for often Olgun cloth guard to be lined up in a terrible row of button is against the loan toggle list. IRQ. Internet sign conflict was commonplace at the time, and it surely ought to find the turpitude tinies arrayed together the three buttons and the one with toggles seemingly in unison. It is of course entirely plausible that within seconds of the snap being taken, orphaned Olgun cloth guard turned on irk and beat him to death with a garden spade, then using the spade to dig a pit in which to bury his battered corpse. There is evidence that such an enormity took place among a group of siblings in a net other than true barinas possibly found this or dungeon s around this time. See, toggle is taught beaten to death with spade by siblings, news other NES page 720 third of October 1962 available in all good nethy newspaper archives. The same thing happened up and down the land is not unlikely, though it was tragic, and spawned several novels, plays, ballets, opera boosts and art installations. We might also pause to study the alignment of buttons on old code and have toggled on Earth. Let us take them in alphabetical order. I think it's fair to say that all must have been a zealot among button is not only are his buttons aligned with impeccable neatness and regularity, but tellingly, only three of them actually serve as buttons, that is, a mere 50% of his buttons are used to fasten his coat. The remaining three serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever. We might dub them redundant or dummy or toy buttons. It was a mark of the more fanatical button is that they would often sport pointless buttons upon their coat. This was not always done with the sense of neatness and balance demonstrated by OLG there were wild stories of button is displaying a chaotic mass of buttons Higgledy Piggledy upon their coats, we can surmise that oh with a bathroom error of the kind who wish to disguises toward buttons is real ones. Certainly, if one passed him on the pavement as he swept by without looking too closely, it would be possible to see buttonholes where in fact there were none. The comparison with aurkc and his toggles is intriguing. Rather than the regular disposition of buttons we see on augue with IRQ we have something stranger, there is a straight top toggle, and further down there appears to be that most anomalous of features are missing toggle. The young toggle loop of cloth on his coat is clearly visible. One explanation for this is that a fight between the siblings had already begun before they stopped to pose for the camera in that fight, missing toggle could have been ripped from his coat but all for all cloth guard. If so, where is it? It may have fallen on the ground, or it may be that all for all gore cloth guard of the approach of the snapper popped it into their mouth. Can we see a telltale bulge in the cheek of any of the three? I think we can look very very closely at off. His right cheek seems decidedly puffier than his left there I would maintain is the missing toggle. When the snapper departs and the button is take the spade to set about irk off, spits the toggle out onto the ground and grind it under his boat.

such weather frenzies of that distant time, weirdly, at the turn of the year, in the depth of that frozen winter of 1962 63. When people really didn't need to wrap up warm in their coats. The mania passed as suddenly as it had begun, and nobody cared to figs about buttons. And toggles ever again. Instead, like got all worked up about figs, but that's another title for another day.

Frank Key  10:41
For a long time, I coveted my neighbor's ox. I knew this was wrong, deeply wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. It was a tremendous ox with a splendid pair of horns, a tailor shouted soup and great bulky lumbering solidity. Its name with Keith. I watched it through my greasy window pain as it moves in it oxy wire around my neighbor's paddock, and I coveted it. I think it's important to point out that they that I did not cover my neighbor's house, which was in any case, and unseemly, how hovel compared with my chalet. Nor did I cover it his wife, nor his manservant, nor his maid servant, nor his ass, for the simple reason that he did not possess any of these. He was at a lonely and lonely fellow crushed by penury, and it was something of a miracle to hear that he had managed to get his hands on an ox and water knocks. The first time I clapped eyes on Keith I was transfixed. I robbed the window pane with a rag the better to view the magnificent beast. After a while, I pulled up a chair so I could sit while peering through the pain, for I felt my spindly legs giving way due to nervous tension. I used the rag to mop my brow and gazed covetously. Oh, covetously all the live long day. Every now and then, Keith would snort and I could hear him clearly. For his snorting with loud and sonorous and I felt free songs of pleasure. For many a day satai watching this majestic ox coveting him, wanting him for my own. As I watched, I hatched plot after plot, I would beat my neighbor to death with a spade and with the same spade, bury him in the earth, and so claimed qisas mine, or I would run away with the ox hauling him along by a halter, heading for the distant hills. Or, I would forge documents proving to the unsuspecting eye that I was the oxys rightful owner, pursuing my neighbor through the highest court in the land if I had to, or I would find somewhere a lesser ox, an inferior one. And when my neighbor's back was turned with substituted for Keith, and keep Keith with me always. It was this latter plot that gave me pause. I realized I had not the first idea how to care for an ox, upon what did one feed them? What oxy appurtenances did they require to live in comfort? Would I risk being gored by those horns? Where I inadvertently to Vex my coveted Keith? Then I began to wonder if my covetousness was all it seemed. Was it the oxide coveted in and of itself? Or was it the act of coveting something, anything that rightly belonged to my neighbor? Could it be that what I really desired over and above everything, was to sit peering through my greasy windowpane, consumed with feelings of envy, for the Lonely Lonely penurious wreck next door and had it not been his ox would I have coveted whatever beast he kept in his paddock, be it a duck, or an ant. I was able to give further thought to these matters when the season of mist descended upon the land and nothing was visible from my window, nothing at all, save a milky gray blur of blankness. The air was so thick and dense that sound did not carry and I could hear no snorts from Keith. I moved my chair away from the window and pulled down the shutters, and I gazed instead at my ceiling upon wick like Dennis Wheatley, I had painted the stars in their heavens.

Frank Key  15:30
Could I covet a star? I could. I picked one fat and sprightly and sparkling Oh, sparkling in a way no ox, not even Keith could sparkle. And while I sat and waited out the long, long months of mist, I hatched plot of the plot to yank that star from the sky and drag it down to earth, to hold it beside me, burning bright, all mine, my coveted star.

Two little important bits of bird nomenclature now. There's a great website called futility closet runbox guy called Greg Ross. And from him I learned that an error if that he is double F is the word we use for a two year old Canary. why there should be a specific word for a two year old Canary is a deep and abiding mystery, at least to me. But next time you're out walking somewhere and you see a two year old Canary you can say, oh look and Arif. And the other the other piece of bird nomenclature, I can't I I am able to be less explicit about in naturally is the Lenten stuff 1599 by Thomas knack, which I've been reading recently and is a magnificent book. He tells us that or suggest at least that another word for a Kestrel is a well it's I can't really say it on air on resonance. I can spell it out it wind f UCKE are this is another word for a Kestrel. And I have a lot of eyes. There's a lot of stuff in in Thomas Nash, national Lenten stuff worth quoting. The book is basically a pion of price to Great Yarmouth, and red herrings. And here's is a is a characteristic sentence. I have a crush it in my head here to have given the reins to my pen and run astray throughout all the coast towns of England, digging up their dilapidations and raking out of the dust people charnel House of tenebrous l the rottenness relic of their monuments, and bright scoured that can get eaten brass of their first bricklayers and founders and commented and parameterised on their condition in the present. And in the Prater tense, not for any love or hatred, I bear them, but that I would not be snipped or have it cast in my dish that therefore I praise Yama so Rang tauntingly because I never elsewhere, baited my horse or took my bow and arrows and went to bed.

Frank Key  19:43
Anyway, there's 43 pages of that kind of stuff. Magnificent prose. You can read the whole thing online and there's a link on the hooting yard website. Don't forget to go to hooting yard at hooting yard.org And while you're there, make a donation. It always helps. If you're on the resonance website, make a donation to resonance because that helps too. So you could make two, two donations, one to resonance and one to hooting yard and then you could go to bed tonight feeling that you've done the right thing. Anyway, I think I have been influenced by the mighty pros of Thomas Nash, because this morning I wrote the following See, see if you will the king's custard crown burnished and gleaming made from metal so soft, you could mold it like mozzie pan, though whoa betide you if you put your hand anywhere near it when it's a top they kingly head. They'll hack two fingers off and shove them into your ears muffling all sound as happened Alas, to my Spry confrere knitty por knitty languishing Deaf now in the Kings donjon and all phase thoughtless prodding from mere curiosity, that custard crown there's a sprig of Larkspur on the Don John's outer wall. On on all souls I'll pluck about and wave it has a nose gay for all the good that will do poor nithi. I plead his case with the hoity toity Chamberlains, and they're scribbling beetles, booted callow Murgatroyd with pig eyes, not one of them are true prints, cushioned against fight, smacking their lips, oh all at sixes and sevens aboard the boat of state. I tried my own clambering aboard it once, in spring, jaunty feather kept in gorgeous hues, but was repelled with sticks and fists and cut jewelry, bloodied and battered and half drowned. I was afterward sprawled ashore in my pumps like a water devil. Snip snip that is loosed, and away it went, billowing on green out of my sight. Me sloshed in build an orphan mithi. Now, step one, two, and cat brisk capers. And you will see the custard crown Oh, bright, gleaming, but now no longer in bondage upon the kingly head. No. With paul wilson shell Medina came sweeping in and snatched it away and carried it to a darkling cave and then the lumpy bumpy bank some landing of the like this he has his army in exile here, custard colored like the crown, pranked swift but so disputatious, like Jabba frenzies or will live long day, and terrible night and scarce can boil an egg for their supper. so caught up are they in their rebar but who who do they might be an earth King though, like a fell dogs still in his palace keep dab that with ointments by his shadow lane has Russian plimsolls hardly showed on his great Titanic enormous feet dangling over the end of the palate. Up Up King, birds chatter on the window sill. There is lively sparring yet in His Kingdom, jack mcglue and all his train cannot lift the king hoist though they try with pulleys and contraptions of fabled strength castered crownless. His life ebbs while below in the donjon nitti waggles the severed fingers plugging his ears and jumps through spirit hoops in dank darkness. And now, his army is on the march beside the railings with their banners and their pipes tooting cacophonous and swallows information flying over their horrible shrunken wizard heads. That zombie army of Nicky's conjuration in rags and tatters foul with sweat swords rusted, as implacable in their progress as a swordfish spearing through the deep marching Clank and jangle on the palace, the collapsing palace perched on its promontory, and crumbling bit by bit into the sea. I plucked another bottle of Larkspur and waved it as a nose guy and tested the wind. The wind is coming in. There is yet an empire to be flattened.

Frank Key  25:04
pertinent to that and to Thomas Nash, is what Edmund Goss had to say about natural Lenten stuff. In an essay he wrote in 1992, he says Lenten stuff gives us evidence that Nash had now arrived at a complete mastery of the fantastic and irrelevant manner which he aim that this book is admirably composed. If we can bring ourselves to admit that the genre is ever admirable. The writers vocabulary has become opulent, his phrases flash and detonate. Each page is full of unconnected sparks and electrical discharge is a sort of Aurora Borealis of wit streams and rustles across the dusky surface, amusing to the reader, but discontinuous and insufficient to illuminate the matter in hand. It is extraordinary, that a man can make so many picturesque striking and apparently apathetic remarks, and yet leave us so frequently in doubt as to his meaning.

Frank Key  26:29
Well, if I can ever write anything halfway as good as Thomas Nash, I shall die a happy man. Although somehow I doubt that I will. Finally this week very briefly, and did those feet Well, did they? I don't give two pins about the time whether it was in ancient time or modern time or some other time. I just want to know if those feet did and if they did, what it was exactly that they did. I suppose you will tell me that they walked. Luxo Murthy. I'd never guessed those feet walked did they take me to the foot of our stairs? And don't get me started on that holy Lamb of God. If I catch sight of it, I'll have it shared and it's fleece fun and knitted into a pair of woolly socks before you can say jack spragens. And I'll put those socks on my feet. And I will walk Yay. I will walk upon England's mountains green. Just try to stop me busta. I suppose you could call that a variation upon Jerusalem, if you so wished. That's all from hooting out for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. many words. And if you want to see that photograph of the button is on the toggle is probably best to go to the shooting guard website and put botania or toggle list into the shooting yard search panel. And you should find it. Yeah, that's it. Bye bye.
