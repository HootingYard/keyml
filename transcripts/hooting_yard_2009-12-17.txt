Good evening and welcome to hooting yard on the air with me, Frank key. And this is the final hooting yard of 2009. By the time I'm back, it will be 2010. Before I go, I'm going to try and mop up the year with a series of pieces, some of which were written some months ago. Yes, anyway, so this first but I may also fall asleep during the program. But hopefully, if I'm lucky, john, the engineer will throw some water at me or something. Anyway, before I read the first piece, there's a legal notice. Accompanying this piece, which is the sludge whole farm mentioned, shouldn't be confused with the real sludge whole farm. There are two distinctly different halls and farms, although the sludge itself is in most respects broadly similar. It is a meteorological peculiarity that the sky over sloughed troll farm is always a lead in the air thick and depressive as if a storm is imminent, but a storm never comes. Equally anomalous is the fact that over at sludge Hall itself, the storm in us never ceases the semi dilapidated building, forever assailed by thunder and rack and downpour. One does not often meet with a trio of stylishly dressed Italian police investigators tramping up the path dislodge whole farm in their Giuseppe Fonseca suits and botho splendido shoes, they cut the sort of dash not seen in this landscape for a century since the heyday of the so called peasantry modern movement. They have come from salon Hall, where they were received in the cubby by the monopod major Damo, who served them with cream crackers and iron tonic. Thus fortified, the detectives announced their intention to visit the farm. The major Damo shuddered, but swiftly dissembled creaking on his crotch over to the dresser upon which rested sloughed tools only metal Tapping Machine, a vintage wonder. I shall let the farmer know to expect you said the major Damo. The detectives print their mustachios and glanced at each other and then their host, and then out of the smudged cubby window, its frame rattling as the tempest roared outside. Having tapped out his communique, the major Damo made arrangements for Lars the factotum to take the Italians on his covered cart halfway towards the farm, to the point where the storm weirdly ceased and the lead and Paul sapped all vigor from the air. And it is some yards beyond where laws drop them off that we find the detectives Now, each walking with insouciance and swish. If sludge whole farm harbored a comely milkmaid, no doubt she would swoon at the sight of such unimpeachable foreign elegance. Alas, it is many a long year since comeliness, in any form has blessed the farm. As the policemen are about to learn. It is now a grim and god awful place. No one knows the name of the farmer of sludge Hall farm. He is a hermit and a mystic and a pole vaulting champion, though aged and wisdom, and though his many, many medals are now rusted and the velvet cushions upon which they sat are eaten away by worms. The farmer still pole volts every day, morning and evening under the lead and sky sludge Hall farm. He is puffing from a pole vault as the Italian detectives push open the gate and greet him. One wonders what will happen. Will the farmer of salado farm speak for the first time in 20 years? Will he use his mystic powers to crack asunder the close knit and almost telepathic team spirit of the detective trio until we're snarling at each other like mad dogs and fighting with pitchforks. Will one of the detectives seek refuge in a barn only to be set upon by a hideous mutant angry pig for the snapped itch chain with a pig its thirst for Italian blood unquenched

then rampage around the farmyard causing the surviving pair of policemen to hide in a hayloft. Will the farmer placate his mutant pig and place it in a trance. Why is the hay in the hayloft? Not like normal Hey, is it hay from another dimension or from somewhere else in the space time continuum? How has the farmer managed to fill the sludge whole farm hayloft with inexplicably bizarre Hey, why have the mustachios of the Italian detectives shriveled by dint of their huddling in the hay? What in the name of Heaven is the mystic farmer doing, leading his entranced pig in ever more rapid circles around the bonfire? What is the exact nature of those sparks shooting from the fire? Why is the lead on the Sky Turning a violent orange? Why are the detectives now sprouting hay from every pore? Is there any intelligible meaning to the definite grunts the entranced mutant pig is making as it's circled around the fire faster and faster until it is a blur? Why backup solid tool as a major Damo and last the factotum hyperventilating convinced by giggles slapping their thighs and dancing a jig upon the dining room table. Tomorrow when we read the front page headline in the daily farmyard, pole vaulter, will we be any wiser about that awful mess at solid coal farm?

More in a broad and similar vein. I keep trying to warn you. Over and over again. I tell you to beware of the airy marshes to shun them for you know not what spooky horrors lie in wait for you there. But you scoff you say for sure Mr. Key you and your blather about the marshes. And you men soften your Wellington boots as only you could mincing Wellington's off towards the airy marshes at dusk without a care puffing on your expensive herbal cigarette. No Matt. No sour Wester not even a lantern, you ignore my besieging to at least take a hound with you a hound with sharp fangs and brutish musculature for protection. But no, you think me and ofin an idiot. And I watch as you vanish into the distance swallowed by the mist that hangs in the air and grows thicker and thicker. The closer you get to the eerie marshes, until suddenly it clears and you stop and stagger and feel a pang of ice creep down your spine. For there hovering above the Erie marshes is an eerie Phantom inexplicably menacing, and in the voice of death, it intones verses 16 and 17, from chapter 36, of the book of Isaiah, to wit, drinky everyone the waters of his own system, until I come and take you away. And you realize with horror, that just before you put on your Wellington boots, that is precisely what you were doing, drinking the waters of your own system, though I implored you not to, I fell to my knees and begged you not to drink those waters. And you sneered at me and Gulp them down from your system. And now the race of the martyrs has come to take you away, just as I told you, it would, and you can struggle and scream and vomit up the waters of your system, but it will avail you not, you will be taken away, away away, leaving only those empty abandoned boots at the edge of the marshes that none shall ever dare go and fetch and they will rot slowly in the midst your boots and all crater view will be gone.

was going to catch up with some things that were some months old. It's a bit late for this one, to be quite honest, given the urgency of it, but never mind. I was listening to the today program on radio for one morning, and I learned the thrilling news that David Blunkett is donating his brain to science. I've taken immediate steps to ensure that here at hooting yard, we do not miss the chance to get our hands on this fantastic obrigado blanket. So I'm launching a special fundraising drive dubbed, let's buy Blunkett brain, there is a Donate button on the hooting yard website, so please give generously. To demonstrate our serious commitment to this project, I've already obtained a jar in which to keep the brain and we'll be rummaging around in the pantry for chemicals and liquid pickling fluid in which to preserve it. Obviously, there were all sorts of exciting experiments to be done. Once we have the blanket brains snugly ensconced in a jar. I think priority should be given to one which attempts to discover why that cow attacked the heroic MP in a designated field. The very same cow or one similar will be tethered to a post and the jar containing blankets brain will be brandished in its face in a threatening manner. Will the cow be frightened in its turn? Or will it strain with its rope and try to attack the jar? Or could there be another outcome entirely, such as the cow displaying no interest in the jar whatsoever and falling into cow sleep? Well only find out if we do all in our power to get hold of that brain as soon as possible. So join the campaign today and give as much cash as you can.

More sort of newsworthy items. There are difficult days like today when I awaken the grip of the fever. My ablutions are performed horribly as if there's no time to waste, even though it's still before dawn. If I can face breakfast, I bolt it like a half staff squirrel alighting upon a single discarded nut on the lawn of a municipal Park. I paced up and down disconsolate, muttering eyes popping my head disheveled and with beetles falling from it. I wander through the Chartered streets and see in every face I meet signs of the same restlessness signs of the same frenzy. aimless and distracted, I return home. My limbs are a quiver, but I snap them to stillness and managed to make a pot of tea. I turn on the kitchen radio and tune into tugboat crew playtime, hoping the tunes will soothe my brain. I feel as if there's a nest of vipers squirming in my vitals, but eventually I gather, I gather, and I walk as boldly as I can across the hall and push open the living room door, and I look down. And of course, it's fine. It's perfectly serviceable, a tad worn in places a faded stain here or there, but nothing I can't cope with. And thus does my carpet madness evaporate. And I'm human again, no longer a demented thing. I had resigned myself to these periodic attacked, but now it seems help is at hand. Because if my carpet madness gets any worse, there is a remedy according to the North Korean Central News Agency, and I quote, product of the Pyongyang carpet factory a drawing interests of many people at home and abroad. The factory with a long history of carpet production is producing various kinds of hand woven carpet, machine woven carpet and others. to suit the world's trend. It is located in so song district of Pyongyang. Pack one troll director of the factory said in an interview with kcna to the following effect, the factory is making silk carpet good for health and longevity, which the Korean ancestors had long used, and wall carpet giving comfortable feeling. Unquote. A doctor once told me he thought my own episodes of carpet madness were brought on by a neurotic terror that my carpet did not suit the world trend. If that is indeed the cause, then I know now know how to conquer the bunkers and once and for all.

My appointment with destiny for dentistry, I forget which was cancelled, and I had an afternoon to play with. So I thought I'd try my hand at piling also upon pelee on as the lower died did in the old story. In some versions, they piled pellier pelee on upon Asa. So to be on the safe side, it seemed to best to attempt both. Now obviously my withered limbs and general Pune Enos prevented me from literally piling one mountain on top of another. I had in mind to construct miniatures to scale out of cardboard and rags and cotton woolen glue. Before turning my hand to this exciting if pointless project, it occurred to me that it was just the kind of thing tiny Enid might have done when she found herself at a loose end. The plucky infant fascist could not bear to be idle. And it was quite possible that between adventures, she might have piled Asa upon pallium or vice versa. Although in her case, I'm sure she had the resourcefulness to tackle the real mountains instead of small, lightweight copies. Had she ever passed the time in this fashion, I was keen to pick up any tips, so I consulted the literature. Ever since the publication of Mavis gasp balls majestic, complete Reference Guide to all the doings attributed to tiny Enid in 20 volumes with roto grab viewers. It takes even the dull witted a matter of minutes to track down the most obscure episodes in the life of the heroic tot. The afternoon was still young, when I slammed the book shut, satisfied that there was nothing tiny Enid could teach me about the task ahead. There was mention of neither also nor Patreon in the index, nor of the lower die, nor of Otis nor FTL tears, and the sole reference to Mount Olympus led to a thrilling yet unrelated account of tiny Enid setting fire to a paper aeroplane upon its Pinnacle, the culmination of the affair dettaglio eyob. In 1955. I was too familiar with this to reread it. So I replaced the books on the shelf, buckled up my boots and prance stuff across the green sward to the heart, wherein I kept my cardboard and rags and cotton wool and glue was ever a hot, so cherished as mine is filthy and in this state of collapse, but to me, it is a kind of paradise. I switched on my radio to listen to cardboard Mountain modulars playtime as I worked. They were playing Scriabin. How curious I thought that so I accomplished a pianist had such tiny little hands. My own hands I lead and and fat and clumsy More's the pity. I'm afraid that after an hour or two of inexpert fumbling and mashing and prodding, I had created a quartet of shapeless compacted clumps. A quartet because I strived to make to model officers and to model pelee ons that I might pile also upon pallium and pile pelee on upon Asa simultaneously rather than consecutively. Perhaps in so doing, I was over ambitious and would have obtained better result had I been satisfied with a single pair, the positions of which also a top pallium or purely on a top also, I could have switched as often as the fancy took me, or indeed, never were one Tableau more pleasing to the eye than the other. As it was all I had to show for an afternoon of strenuous cack handedness were for almost identical methods of cardboard and rags and cotton wool and glue, a fuming temper, an overheated radio set and a sense of defeat I would struggle to shake off for years to come. I bundled my officers and aliens into a burlap sack and on my way home chapra sack into a pond where it floated for a while until it was eventually destroyed by the ferocious packing of swans

and another cardboard modeling project now, never let it be said that I don't. Very, very my subject matter. Anyway, this is called replica. No it's not. It's called replica Eden. Cardboard Adam stands hand in hand with cardboard Eve in front of a cardboard tree around which is twine the serpent of plasticine plus the same to the fruit to which hang from the cardboard branches of the tree. In truth, cardboard Adam and cardboard Eve are not so much holding hands is sharing a single hand between them further they've been cut from a single sheet of cardboard. Cardboard Adams other hand is a plain cardboard hand. But to cardboard Eve's other hand is stuck a glob of plasticine. It is not perfectly spherical for a chunk has been taken from it. The suggestion is that cardboard Eve has bitten the trunk out of the plasticine fruit. Tiny glittering beads are sunk in the head of the plasticine serpent, and they give the impression that they are gazing at each cardboard hand. There is a little motor attached by wires to the balsa wood panel upon which cardboard alum and cardboard Eve are posed. depressing a knob on the motor switches it's on and causes the panel and thus the cardboard figures to tremble. Their trembling is redolent of the terror they experience when the Lord informs them of their fall. Over on the draining board, a third cardboard figure is lying flat. It has been dogged with a block of crimson paint and punctured with a toothpick. This is cardboard able. Cardboard cane has been chucked into a patch of filth out in the gutter representing the land of nod. It took me two years to make my replica Eden or replica Eden and replica nod it was time well spent. I'm now going to use my leftover cardboard and plasticine to make a model of pointy town pair including the bat and the goats and the crocus.

Things are going from bad to worse with Dennis beer pint. The weed the poet still posing as a beatnik was apparently very upset by the negative reviews of his newly published gins. burgie Howley piece whimper 1000 odd lines of unrelieved drivel, public performances where he has been declaiming these free verse witterings and from platforms and soap boxes, hecklers boo and things get chucked at him, chiefly tomatoes. Now beer pint has fallen victim to delusions of persons In a letter to the weekly magazine, we the poet's under attack. He claims that this passage from the anatomy of absurdity by Thomas Nash, written over 400 years ago, is aimed directly at him, and I quote, hence come our babbling ballots and our new found songs and sonnets, which every read knows Fiddler hat at his finger and, and every ignorant ale night will breathe forth over the pot. As soon as his brain waxes hot beers are true truth which they would choose, they interlace it with a lie or two to make meter, not regarding Verity, so they may make up the verse, not unlike to Homer who cared not what he feigned so he might make his countrymen famous. But as the strangest things being put into water seem crooked. So the credible is truth, if once they come with encompass of these men's Wits seemed tails were that the infamy of their ignorance did redound only upon themselves, I would be content to apply my speech otherwise, center there, Apple lay on his butt syste obtain the name of our English poet, and thereby make men think more basically of the width of our country. I cannot turn them out of their counterfeit livery and brand them in the forehead, that all men may know their falsehood. Well, politic counselor, of valiant soldier will draw your glory of this in that some stitcher Weaver, spendthrift or Fiddler has shuffled or Sloboda, a few ragged rhymes in the memorial of the ones prudence or the others prowess. It makes the learned sought to be silent, when as they see and learned soft so insolvent. Unquote, is better pint and insulin. unlearned SOT perhaps he is. On the other hand, if this passage really is directed at him, it's likely to be the one and only time he is compared to Homer. But now my own brain waxes hot for the sun is bright and battering. And I must lie me down in the shade and ponder the wonders of Burnham on crouch, of which more some other time

was written a long time ago, months ago when it was sunny. And I think we've just got time for one very short piece before I go. final piece of 2009 in a cardboard box on a wooden shelf in a broom cupboard behind a door in a corridor on the ground floor of a shabby house on Anil lit lane winding towards the sea in a land whipped by blizzards and gales. There is an old picture postcard stuffed in among a jumble of papers and scraps and cotton reels and bobbins and pins and clinker and Alton scantlings. The picture on the postcard is probably the picture on the postcard is of a pavilion on a green by the sea. On the other side of the postcard to which in one corner is stuck a postage stamp, there is scrolling fading ink and a legible name and address and a message written in block capitals and unpunctuated. And it says, Do not forsake me. Oh my darling. If we knew who lived in the shabby house on the line, if we rapped upon the door with a stick to coax them into the open, ah, then we might be able to find out who had forsaken, whom so many years ago, before the ink faded on the postcard. In the past. When the blizzards and the gales whipping the land were more violent or so we're told in the tavern near the beach, by ancient sailors who remember remember the weather, the weather
