Good afternoon pickers. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is the first episode of hooting yard on the air of 2007. And this this week's show, this first show of the year, basically takes the form of an extended advertisement for befuddled by cormorants, which is what you've all been waiting for, I hope, I sincerely hope, which is a print anthology from hooting yard 52 stories gathered together in paperback format with a lovely cover. In order to get a copy, you can either go to the resonance website and go to the shop, click on the shop. Or you can go to hooting yard www dot hooting odd.org and find out about the book there and buy it is only available online. It's one of those kind of things. But how I would recommend it, wouldn't I and I do. So I'm gonna read some extracts from the book. Regular listeners will have heard these stories before. But you know, hooting yard is a live shows so if nothing else, my intonation will be different. I like coffee at different moments. It's a it's that kind of experience. This story is called how I plunged into the bottomless Viper pit of Gar. For too many years to count, I traveled the world visiting bottomless vida pits. I studied them, sketched them, photograph them and wrote up a lengthy and detailed descriptions of each and every one. My patience is almost inhuman, and it needed to be because sooner or later some well meaning numbskull would ask in relation to this or that bottomless Viper pit. Tell me Professor bind weed. If the Vita pit is bottomless, we're in heaven's name of the Vipers. And each time I would sigh and give my interlocutor a look of saintly forbearance and reply on ledges Of course from very near the top and then intervals of a few feet all the way down. For in my experience, this was invariably the case from the bottomless pit viper pit of Oh hooligans Wharf to the bottom was Viper pit of San Cristo bool. Then one day, armed only with the shreds of a map and a flask of brackish water. I came upon the bottomless Viper pit of Gar one thing you must understand is that I had been at this work for so long that very little surprised me anymore. So please do not think I'm exaggerating when I say that I was thunderstruck, bit dazzled, giddy and incredulous, for I was all those things and more. The amazing thing about the bottom was via the pit of Gar, was that it had been turned into a sort of tourist attraction. Offense had been placed around it. Gigantic, gaudy signs flashed on and off, and fairground music blared out of stacks of loudspeakers. to exploit one of the remotest bottomless Viper pits in the world for commercial game seemed wrong to me, and suddenly drained of my inhuman patience. I marched up to the person standing behind the counter of the ticket booth. I ranted and raved at him for at least five minutes shouting my head off and flailing my arms. And do you know what? He took absolutely no notice of me. This enraged me even further, and I was about to give him a clean, decent sock on the jaw when I heard running footsteps behind me, and a withered voice croaking. Wait, wait. I turned to see an unkempt beanpole of a fellow hastening towards me. He slowed up, wheezing and staggered the last few steps. Don't harm the land, please, sir. He's a good worker takes the cash and hands out the tickets. His name is Tommy. He's a deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball. I looked back at the urging and sure enough, he bought a striking resemblance to Roger Daltrey circa 1969. I harrumphed. Would you be wanting to buy a ticket then sir? asked the beam pole. I think my reply a speech based on a lecture I had given it the bottomless Viper pit club of Helsinki a decade ago, took about an hour to deliver. I'm not sure how much of what I said got through to the lanky in great I do not He sat down.

Sorry, I do know that he sat down on a nearby tuffet as exhaustion setting that Tommy packed up and went home that I inserted some new rhetorical tricks into my tirade, that clouds scattered across the sun, and that the sun itself set before I had finished, my listener had now fallen into a deep sleep a sprawl his tuffet. ignoring him, I clambered over the wicked gates that the pinball wizard had locked before he left and approached the bottomless Viper pit of Gar, with mounting excitement. It was dark, and I had no torch, but I picked my way carefully towards the edge of the bottomless Viper pit. I laughed aloud with glee as I heard the familiar hiss of countless pit Vipers. The years seem to fall away, and I felt again that tingle of an unalloyed happiness that I experienced when, as a spindly 12 year old, I had accompanied my father to the bottomless Viper pit of shrubbery NES, my very first bottomless Viper pit and not of nostalgia tightened in my stomach. I put my hand up to my hat and doffed it, it was my father's hat, the one he had given to me on that very day, the same hat, which he had brandished to ward off a particularly malevolent pit viper that was about to sink its fangs into my heart. I adopt my father's hat, and I plunged into the bottomless Viper pit of Gar.

That previous text by Professor bind lead power plunged into the bottomless Viper pit of Gar, contained a number of errors. These were due to production problems, escaping gas, an unexpected tea bag mishap and the distractions of acquire belting out Shenandoah at top volume. At hooting yard, however, we pride ourselves in setting the record straight, the very earliest opportunity. There were three errors in the tale and they were of a kind, as several readers of the original texts pointed out with commendable promptness. There are no bottomless Viper pits at Oh hooligans Wharf or at shrubbery ness and there is no such places sand Christo boo. Let us take each one in turn in reverse order. Sand crystal ball does not exist, at least not in any Atlas I know of. And it's difficult to know which bottomless Viper pit Professor bind we'd had in mind. It may be an anagram of bassoon cloche Shire, but my well thumbed Gazetteer of that buskey paradise on earth state specifically paid 1249 that there are no Viper pits in the county, bottomless or otherwise. Incidentally, the name of the Shire has nothing to do with bassoons hence the spelling with one s. The derivation is from basin. I'm reminded that listeners have long been promised a series of articles on the important topic of basins and these are currently in preparation. So please stop sending those pleading emails. When I said shrubbery ness, I should have said live them sometimes. To think for one minute that there could be a bottomless Vita pizza dough hooligans Worf is so preposterous. I'm surprised that the globe kept spinning on its axis after this Howler appeared. As soon as the error was brought to my attention, I fired off an apology to the five fiendish burgers of Oh hooligans Wharf. Terrified as I was of swift and brutal reprisals. I received a very gracious acknowledgement, which I'm happy to read out to you now. Oh Qi oui oui oui. Oui, oui. The five fiendish burgers of Oh, hula hums Wharf. That is first gods. Soak second power drew third can sigma Baba det fourth PIP and fifth Billy Strayhorn do hereby say to you in arch lewd, monstrous grating, swinish implacable horse declaration and then in the Yulia library incantation of a mu as in, that we we we we we have taken unto our biases and tunics, the sentiments of your pity as government and we we, we, we, we have pronounced it good. The battalions of the Oh hooligans Wharf Avenger platoon have been called off before they even had time to mount their hideous macro answer. phallic horses. Yes, that hideous macro answer phallic horses with their fierce biting spittle flecked fangs that gallop at double the speed of light. Don't let it happen again. So I've promised my new powers the five fiendish burgers, who are coming around for tea later on today to write something accurate and complimentary about uhlans Wharf in the near future.

Here's one of his one of the other tiles in befuddled by cormorants, the exciting hooting yard paperback published in in association with resonance FM. Here's what it says on the back cover. A treasury of bedtime Tales for pallid and sickly infants. befuddled by cormorants is a collection of 52 stories from hooting out on the air. Frank keys are claimed right radio show on resonance FM. That's the show you're listening to at this very moment. And there's one of various blurbs from various sources, one of which is from a web web page or a website or bulletin called the barbell lift underground. I'm not entirely sure what the bubbling underground is. But their view of hooting out is that it's frankly insanely bizarre, which I'm not sure I agree with anything I try to be quite sensible as in this next tale which is a tale of confidential agent blot. One of confidential agent blot earlier investigative triumphs was cracking the case of the disheveled marmalade man, let us recall the fact that winning of horses had disturbed the sleep of the little village of sprang for two months. There was a damp, hideous thing in the corner of the post office that none dared approach. Perhaps most jarring of all, an illegal cafeteria had been built slap in the middle of the village surrounded by menacing guard dogs whose fangs glistened in the moonlight. Agent block arrived on the scene on a Tuesday afternoon frantic with gales his dazzling cone shaped hat made the villagers wonder what frustum it had once topped. His complexion was paler, more drawn and anguished than usual, possibly because a change in diet had given him a reason to attack of the seeds, from which he was not yet fully recovered. His breath was tangled with the fumes of his weird pills, tiny pink spangles that Dr. Greg had insisted upon. confidential agent blot, commandeered and abandoned bird seed silos his headquarters and subjected every single villager to a lengthy interrogation. His manner was charming, but curiously unnerving. The clinic was soon filled with haunted looking patients demanding to have their brains sluiced with Baxter's terrible fluid box Saturday afternoon, with no let up in the gales sprang had an era of almost biblical calamity. And yet, and yet, as soon as his last interview was done with agent blocks sprang upon the disheveled marmalade man and carted him off to the dungeon in his cave, the horses winning ceased. The thing in the post office evaporated, a law was passed to make the cafeteria legal, and the dogs bounded away across the hills, their atrocious, yapping, growing ever fainter, until it could no longer be heard at all.

I'm here is a particular favorite of mine. Once again, it's a repeat, but you know, I've already made one reading error. So if there was another one, and there probably will be in this because there's words here I'm not sure how to pronounce. So it'd be different from last time you heard it if you heard it before.

Did you thank gnome for the coolness of the water, dried and cooled? Did you collapse your library ticket in your tiny hand and scamper excitedly to the public lending library to borrow a book of fairy stories? You would have looked for something with pictures of elves and wizards and parries and hobgoblins and found a compendium paps carried it on tippy toe to the issuing desk bathed in the glorious sunshine streaming through those enormous library windows.

moot note, Horace, Seth and nubus these are Gods all powerful and eternal. I can picture you a few summers later, older but no wiser traipsing around in the park at lunchtime. You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon the grass as food for sparrows and magpies and starlings for linnets and ravens for bufflehead ducks and grebes sitting on the rusty bench with it rusty plaque in memory of one long dead who sat here often and adored the view the view of rooftops and chimneys and football fields and allotments of tennis courts and orchards, rich in cherry trees. I see you casting your crumbs to the birds, and I know that you're not giving thanks to artin or gab or sekhmet or Qatar. No spill at this time. Despite your riches and your bravura. Your poor head is filled with visions of its Papa lottle coaxially que tenemos Cal tacky tlaloc maharal ke ha tuerto quix Tokyo hackled Papa Cata petrol and alike for these are your gods in the grip of your delusions. It's perhaps not coincidental that you like to sport a yellow Polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man and even have your hair cut in a similar mop, though you're not yet going gray and you insist that you have not seen the film for you profess a devotion to the silence screen in your Pantheon. Abel ganz rub shoulders with Oxo moko, Lillian Gish with quite sad collapse. You have seen broken blossoms more than a dozen times, and sometimes you like like to pace the backstreets of Limehouse, as if in search of the opium dens that are no longer there. The dens from which Sherlock Holmes emerged, twitching and shattered in the man with the twisted lip. Those fogging, shrouded days are as distant now as the bright summers of your paddling pool youth. Yet you cling to your false gods as you feed the birds and ducks in the park shaded from nuts glittering sky by the overhanging branches of Sycamores and Hazel trees on the bench by the magnificent iron railings, which were replaced after the war in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach burned by flaming barrels and crushed by falling masonry. But now there is not a scratch on you. And you have forgotten that terrible day in shaven England. You were treated well in the field hospital. But what did you do once you could again use your hands you scavenge scraps of wood and built a little toy altar and put it on your bedside shelf, praying to extra little Tom, your God of healing for having saved you from the realm of miksa lantech Pootle so let us spring forward again now another 1020 years and now your hair is gray but no longer cut Allah Lord summarized in The Wicker Man.

You have a blighted reputation and constant pins and needles. That is what accounts for your restlessness, this shuffling from bedroom to pantry to parlor to outhouse, from attic to cellar, and back again, up and down and round and round. And always with your liver spotted fist clamped around a little tin medallion of Montezuma, as if that might fend off the night, the darkness, the vastness of eternity. You have a kitten but it hates you. You have not yet been subjugated by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you call your kitten Karen Carpenter and feed it with fish that you pluck from ponds or with eels, you feed from the back kitchens of canteens, and your kitten hisses at you and claws you and loads the sight of you.
