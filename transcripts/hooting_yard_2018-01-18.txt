Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I wasn't here last week and those of you who've, who keep an eye on the hooting od website, well know that since the beginning of the year I have been and I'm still pretty, although I did struggle into the studio to keep you entertained this week. However, there's a distinct possibility that I might just keel over and lay my head on the desk. So luckily, john is at hand with the emergency style of phone service that happens you'll just get some stylophone music and anything else he can come up with a short notice. But I will attempt to read you some pros and see how I get on with it. Dear Dr. Fang wrote marigold Chu, I'm writing to you as the most eminent brain quack I can think of to ask for your help. Dobson has gone do Lally yesterday he was as right as rain, a curious phrase I grant you but let us not dwell upon it. Sitting is escrow tois scribbling away then trudging along the towpath of the filthy old canal in the pouring rain, chucking pebbles swans he remained reassuringly Dobson like breakfast this morning, tucking into a bowl of boiling the bag koala bear brains and Mac plums and blathering in consequential poltroon worries just as he always does. It was only when they drained the last dregs from the his tumbler of post breakfast sculpture that I noticed something I miss. Instead of putting on his Uruguayan notary public boots and crashing out of the door into the teeming downpour, as I expected him to do, he stayed sitting at the breakfast table, a thin smile playing about his lips, a fat Beatles scuttling through his Buffon, a blob of marmalade on his cravat. Look, can you see it? Oh, my character bundle of utter loveliness, he said, pointing at a corner of the room. I could see nothing save for some dust. It is my little man, by who monk aeolus he has been following me about in his Saturn untap in his frock coat and bippity boppity hat. He whispered words I can never quite hear. I asked Dobson what on earth he was talking about. He continued to prattle. Even were I able to hear him I'm not sure I would be able to understand his whisperings. Not only is he a foreign little man from remote and distant parts not shown on any map. But he always whispers with his mouth full. He is forever stuffing his job with smokers popped out of which he seems to have an endless supply. Have you noticed any packets missing from the ladder? Oh, my Buttercup. You mean the pantry Dobson? I said, No. I have noticed no such thing. larder pantry pantry larder he went on excitably sofa cushions shaves long poofy Lamy place and bake me pie. I'm starving for me gravy. Leave my shoes and door unlocked. I might just slip away. If I slip away. Perhaps I can escape my little man. But it's likely he will follow me. God knows I haven't been able to shake him off these past 17 years. It was at this point that I asked Dobson if he had taken leave of his senses, but he ignored the question. He came 17 years ago, and to this day, he showed no intention of going away. He said sometimes he moves his arms as if they were The propellers on a seaplane, the gnome omega powered fabra hydrabio and for example, I have to place extra paperwhites on my escrow when he does this in close proximity to it to prevent my papers being blown away. Are you sure you can't see him? I assure Dobson the light could not.

I think the propelling of his arms is an attempt to dry his hands, he continued, his palms are horribly moist. Indeed for such a tiny man, he is surprisingly moist in every particular. Yet whenever he follows me into the bathroom, he shuns the towels. They seem to frighten him, as nothing else does. Imagine that being frightened of towels, tea towels to especially those of a souvenir variety, bearing depictions of important buildings and tourist attractions. Once he vomited all over the tea towel, we brought in the gift shop at some bibley big dead Cathedral. When I tried to launder it, he snatched it away from me and tore it into strips and tied it to his traffic. What well, caffeine, I could not help but ask. They're perched on a shoulder tiny but weirdly luminous. It is the only traffic I know that glows in the dark, or eats linen or monkeys. It ate my little man's little monkey which he kept at the end of the length of string during the Tet offensive. If if you take the string to it is quite a caffeine. By now I was convinced that Dobson had gone do louhi thinking of violent bash on the head might bring into his senses. I went to fetch a hammer. When I returned, there was no sign of him and the front door was ajar. I looked in the shoe cupboard, but all of his many, many, many, many boots were lined up neatly along the Buta squad, had Dobson done the unthinkable, and he left the house in his socks. Indeed, he had towards midday also known as noon, when the hand of the clock both pointed upwards in an uncompromising vertical. I received a call from the seaside police Dobson was sat on a pair bootless cradling in his arms, the limp body of a strangled eel and staring out to see his socks were wet, his cravat was awry, and there were traces of truck ice around his mouth. A ring of lump and proles gathered to taunt him. I rushed out and jumped aboard a shower bank heading for the seaside. The police had removed Dobson from the pier and installed him in a cubby within the seagull sanctuary. I had to use all of my powers of persuasion to get past the armed security guards. I found Dobson sprawled on a bunk looking bewildered. Vin Coleman is gone, he cried. vinculin I asked my little man my hammock culus he said, he followed me at a trot all the way to the seaside. And while I was at the kiosk on the pier, buying several truck ices, he lost his footing and fell from the pier into the sea, the sea, the terrible, vast wet sea. I fear he drowned there in my little man. It occurred to me that if finkelman was a tiny amount of Dobson claimed in debate, it was likely that he was so light in weight that he would bippity bop, like his hat upon the water, rather than sink. Then it further occurred to me that Dobson had gone to Lally, and that his purported haemonchus was nothing but a figment of his fuming brain. I was still carrying the hammer, so I gave Dobson a smart crack on the head with it, hoping to restore his reason. Alas, the hammer blow had quite the opposite effect, while rubbing his bonds Dobson gate into the corner of the seagull, Sanctuary, cubby and let out a joyful yell. ving Coleman, you have escaped from the clutches of the Wild West Sea, where once you were moist, you are now soaked to the skin. Were you not fearful of towels? I would dab you dry, but I'm so happy to see you. What is that you are whispering to me in your foreign guttural tongue. Of course, there was nothing in the corner except for some dust and a stray seagull feather. After signing some papers and feeding cream crackers to an injured seagull. I was allowed to bring dogs in the home. It is now early evening And he has insisted on setting a third place at the dinner table and carefully portioning out or helping jellied hair and drugged eels and dragon shards of frozen celery is invisible little man. I am at my wit's end Dr. Fang, or at the end of my tether, whichever end is likely to snap

first, and I need your help. Please come at once.

Dear Mrs. winckelmann, wrote Dr. Fang, at your request, I have conducted an examination of the brain from which my feet is 45 pains 10 sore legs and six pins. Please pay in cash by midnight or I will confiscate the brain and place it in a jar in my cupboard O'Brien's capitalism as I do so. It is my considered opinion that you're suffering from a common malady this indulging a fantasy that you are a personal friend and confidante of the 20th century's Titanic if out of print pamphleteer. In your case, there is an intriguing level of displacement, where you imagine it is not you but your husband, who is bosom pals with Dobson. Incidentally, your husband is indeed an extremely tiny little man who could easily be mistaken for a homunculus Perhaps that is what caused the illusory vapors in your brain. As I say, it is not unusual for insignificant riffraff such as yourself to attach themselves to illustrious figures such as Dobson. I know of another patient, who spent many years convinced she was on intimate terms with octogenarian Franco fall pop songstress, Petula Clark. If you take the pills, I've given you six per day for 17 years, your symptoms will surely alleviate. I also recommend close reading of Dobson's pamphlet, at no time Did I ever cradled in my arms, the limp body of a strangled eel upon appear, while taunted by lumpen proles and I have signed a legal affidavit to this effect, and other essays, together with a spirit photograph of Petula Clark holding hands with a homunculus. out of print.

How big is gold? Well, we now know because I'm in the ancient Jewish hash a lot. Sacred Book, it gives precise measurements of the space between God's thighs and his neck, revealing that from head to toe. He is 1290 8 billion kilometers tall. That eight 806 and a half billion miles for those of us who still use sensible measurements. So there's something for you to remember. The size of gold, gold is 106 and a half billion miles.

Few relationships are as close and as intense as that between a janitor and his mop. He may sense an attachment is bunch of keys and his pail and his dog if he has one. But he cherishes his mop more than anything. I've spent several years interviewing janitors and invariably they volunteer the information that they're mop is their most treasured possession. They will say this loudly and with vehemence, even when their dog is sitting obediently at their feet, gazing up at them in adoration. I'm sure there is a monograph to be written one day upon janitors and their dogs. But I shall leave that joy to another Scribbler. It is not that I'm averse to dogs. Well, I am. But it's not my aversion that dissuade me from writing about them. We're a janitor to spout effusive folly roll on the subject of these dogs. During one of my interviews, I would note it down accordingly and include it in my finished piece. I do not provide verbatim transcripts, preferring instead to give the reader or listener an impressionistic or expressionistic or borderline hysterical portrayed of the janitor through gorgeous words. Not all of these words will have been spoken by the janitor nor by me, but they seem to hover in the ether in the janitors vicinity. That is what I try as best I am able to communicate. It remains a remarkable fact that the thousands of janitors I have interviewed over the years have expressed boundless love for their mops. Often their move to tears or contrarily to gales of unbridled Glee, or sometimes both turn and turn about. It is an emotionally wrenching experience for them to be interviewed, and also for me, as the interviewer broaching the topic of the mop, and not knowing whether I will need to provide a napkin for them to dab at their tear stained cheeks, or a similar napkin for myself to wipe off the flecks of spitals sprayed over me by janitors in the extremes of happiness. It occasionally happens that the dog if it's frisky will try to catch the napkin, either of the napkins in its drawers, and scamper away with it as if it were a bone. They are mysterious creatures, dogs, and often quite stupid. The mob being inanimate is much more predictable, and much less bother. For reasons I've not yet been able to fathom no publishers expressed an interest in my book of janitorial interviews. It thus remains in manuscript handwritten with a book just pencil in a series of exercise books, some online some online. For the past several months, I've had these books stored in a cupboard on the ground floor of a large building in a central location, near a bank into the vaults of which I wish to transfer them for greater security when I can afford the fee to do so. In the meantime, the cupboard is kept locked and watched over by a janitor, one of the few I have not yet taken time to interview, he Prowse the Cardinals, rattling his bunch of keys, deploying his beloved mop and followed everywhere by his dog. Insert apt matin phrased to conclude this pace with a fright of significance.

The relationship between a janitor and his pail is a matter well worth or attention. Some Janice's will call their pail a bucket but it's much of a muchness it may well be that for the pernickety, a pail and an A bucket. Excuse me, it may well be that for the pernickety, a pail and a bucket and not quite the same thing. But we are not pernickety. At least not today. Today, we are having one of our non pernickety days. Good heavens. We did not even time the boiling of our breakfast egg to the second as we do on our pernickety days. Now, today, we plop the egg into the pan and set the burners roaring beneath it and we wandered away, picked up the post from the doormat, kick the wind Scott. Take it again. God knows why. Check the post into the wastepaper basket. It was all flyers flyers, put the kettle on, extracted from our majestic boufal a small beetle which had taken up residence peas on like, and placed it on the window sill. Open the window, adjusted the position of the vows of hollyhock cuttings, turning them towards the light. Though Lord knows there was little enough light so early was the hour, and pottered and pattered in other degree ways, before returning to the kitchen to set the burners roaring beneath the pan. without checking the time on our wristwatch, rather judging the sufficiency had passed for the egg in the pan to be to thumb when shelled on a pernickety day, on the other hand, we would not have we would not leave our post by the cooker, but count the minutes and the seconds, gazing from wristwatch to pan and back again. And there's the second hand on the watch talks to its appointed spot. We would immediately lift the pan from the roaring burners, extinguish them, place the egg from the receiving waters, and transfer it to an egg cup, a souvenir egg cup from an ill starred seaside resort, sure, in the knowledge that it had been boiled for a very specific and particular length of time, as recommended in Bachmann's manual of egg boiling, Second Edition lilac series. That's the variation between our Pinnacle tea and our non pernickety days of variation designed to crack us from the bonds of rot. What does that have to do with Janice's and pails or if you prefer, janitors and buckets? little or nothing like the littleness of the light as we talk into our early morning boiled egg, like the nothingness at the core of our all to mortal soul.

So baffled were the police by the seeming ramifications of the In spip case, but they had no idea what to do, until a dejected inspector threw in the towel, and suggested reluctantly, reluctantly, that they call in Tarleton the amateurs amateur in hope that he might had a clearing through their mental forest. To which tartans response upon receipt of the coppers telegram was to instruct his help meet the dwarf crew Pascoe to pay them a visit and pull one of his faces at them. To which crew Pascal's response was a usual said in a trembling voice fade was all too aware that when he pulled one of his faces, the effect on those who saw it was akin to something from the story by HP Lovecraft, reducing the witness to a horror stricken gibbering wreck fit only to be chained up in an asylum for the incurably insane for the rest of their days. But Talton insisted, telling Keira Pascoe to pull face number 43 expressive of fathomless and bitter contempt. So the dwarf toddle off along the line towards the police station, and on his way in counted as Kant would have it, one of the teaming ramifications of the inspec case, in that not far not too far along the way, he tripped and toppled into the bottomless Viper pit of shrubbery ness, and was mightily surprised, after falling just a few feet to land with a crunch upon a false bottom in the Viper pit, a platform installed by unknown hand, possibly, but not definitively in spits the crunchy nature of his landing, caused by the biscuit moment upon the platform of eggshells in great abundance, with no sign whatsoever of the eggs in it. The albumin and yellow yolk and whatever else an egg expert might describe. inside an egg that were just the shells upon which Pascoe landed crunch early, before sitting up and rubbing his bonds and wondering why he had not continued to fall forever and ever, as much surely as surely to his fate, the Viper pit of shrubbery ness, like that of Gar and of several others, being notorious for being bottomless. According to the guidebooks and gala tea is available from the souvenir kiosk located at one end of a sort of modern day ley line along which magnets cease to function and clump the veteran bind we'd withered at the other end of which stood surrounded by an imposing fence fitted with floodlights, the police station, we're in the frazzled coppers we're still awaiting a response from Tarleton, the amateurs amateur and busying themselves Meanwhile, by rummaging for the umpteenth time, through their miles of filing cabinets, in which every last scrap of information regarding the inspect case was kept from that very first report of an eyewitness a preternaturally alert passers by who had tested negative for hallucinogens thrice, and who had brought breathlessly panting panting to the coppers attention. The Curious circumstance, that in screwin hunahpu model village, the aviary behind the milk factory, with life size, and filled with real birds, such that they would appear enormous and monstrous, to the tiny little fingers populating the model village, and their cause and chirps and corrupts, and krills. Definitely loud, and that this anomaly was just the kind of thing in spirit would clap his hands with glee over though try as they might not a single officer could say with any certainty hand on heart that instead had form in the area, nor indeed, that he even knew where the screwed hunahpu model really was, given the reported sightings of him for the past two decades, placed him elsewhere. And he had been banned from consulting maps and atlases for even longer than that, ever since the box shadow puppetry case when he was albeit briefly in cahoots, or up to his eyeballs. as Detective Captain card pan put it with babinski the lumbering walrus mustache psychopathic serial killer, and alliance that was mercifully short lived, thanks to kargh pan, the very same.

The very same card pad, who now rummaging in one of the filing cabinets, chanced upon a tattered black and white snapshot of an unidentified Acrobat, performing an unidentified feat of acrobatics, which would have seemed physically impossible, were it not for the photographic evidence, and on a whim or accident, the detective Captain looked at the snapshot from a geometrically unlikely angle, and saw suddenly what nobody else had seen before himself included, which was that in her poise, and perhaps your letter, the Acrobat seemed to be personating the exact lineaments of the stick figure in the corner of an emblem on the flag of a secret society, the doings or misdoings of which had ravaged several important colonial outpost and not a few unimportant ones. at the tail end of the war, one of the wars and which had long been thought consigned to the dustbin of history. But which card and now realized with a lovecraftian shadow could indeed still be active and engaged in nefarious shenanigans here and now, and particularly in the Muslim model, religious screwed hunahpu. And I've completely missed time this because this list is one sentence I've been reading. And it goes on and on, and I'm not going to finish it for this week show. So I'll just have to do that next week. Assuming I'm still living and breathing. I have managed to get through the show. That's the end of this week's one. Happy New Year to you all. belatedly, bye bye
