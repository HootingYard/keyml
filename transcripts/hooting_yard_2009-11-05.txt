Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM and this is hooting yard on the air. And I'm Frank key and I'm going to read to you for approximately 28 minutes or so. Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. Remember to the case of the distressed pig solved by special agent blot. The distressed pig was found in a rowing boat crossing tan Tara beam Lake agent blot, swam out to it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becomed agent blot took the oars and he rode to the mud splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plotted his way and his Wellington boots to the pig farmers hat down the lane, and he felled the brute with a swac of his fist, and bound him up with a train. Agent blot drag the pig farmer off to the prison, bang in the center of town. And that is why, on November the fifth, the distressed pig did not drown.

Even the most learned of Dobson scholars has difficulty with his pamphlet, how I swatted my caco demon with a pointy stick and some bleach out of print. For one thing, who knew Dobson had his own personal Calico demon. It's never mentioned elsewhere in the canon, nor does it make an appearance in his voluminous diaries. Occasionally, like other indefatigable diarist Dobson had recourse to codes and symbols. But all of these have been deciphered after decades of study by Aloysius nesting bird and their significance revealed in his magisterial survey, the meanings of every single one of those enigmatic symbols and scribbles in the journals of the out of print pamphleteer Dobson itself Alas, now out of print to nesting bird realized that the child is drawing of a horned and hooved goatee devil finger brandishing a spit fork, usually done in red ink, which appears in the diaries from time to time without additional written comment had nothing whatsoever to do with some putative caco demon of Dobsons, but was simply the pamphleteers idiosyncratic manner of noting that Hungarian football a spheric push gas had played a blinder in a match that day. Push gas was never known by a nickname aligning him with a devil of any kind. But nesting bird shows convincingly that the inside of Dobson's head was rarely in accord with the wider world. Nor do we find any reference to a caco demon in any of the recorded utterances or Memoirs of marigold to surely the woman who knew Dobson better than anyone else would have known of it. There is a possibility, of course, that she did know that kept a judicious silence, for fear of exposing her enamorado to ridicule. But then there was much else that was preposterous about Dobson from his boots to his handwriting, and he seems to have happily acknowledged, even celebrated his various absurdities. One of the pamphlet itself in its startling opening sentence, the pamphleteer announces that he's going to tell us all about how he thwarted his caco demon with a pointy stick and some bleach and that if his prose were paint in this pamphlet, it would be matte rather than gloss. The fact is, Dobson continues in some of the glossiest pros he ever wrote. Indeed, certain passages are so glossy, that nesting bird among others, has recommended reading it through a screen or a veil to dial it to an earthly sheen. Dobson gives his caco demon no backstory. He does not explain when it first began to haunt him, nor how terrible or otherwise has been its impact upon his life. It merely shimmers before him. After breakfast one drizzly morning in April, and he reports this matter of factly as if it's a familiar accompaniment to his post breakfast drizzly April morning doings. On the particular morning of which you write marigold true is a way which may in itself be significant. Dobson does not tell us where she has gone, but by checking the calendar, one can conclude she was probably on one of her periodic joints to shrubbery nest as part of the bottomless Vita pit study group. Dobson then recounts how he loses patience with his caco demon. It is making demands upon him as we are given to understand it always does and the pamphlet is snaps. He goes to the broom cupboard and takes out a pointy stick and dips the end of the stick in bleach and charges across the room at the Calico demon shouting his head off and threatening to impale it upon the stick. At this point, with a hideous sort of sucking and seething and squelching noise, the Calico demon seems to implode in upon itself, bringing himself to a halt just before he clatters into the wainscoting, the pamphleteer piers down at the floor and sees a tiny smart driven noise, some glue. This he suggest is all that's left of his caco demon. He leans the pointy stick against the wall and goes to the draining board to fetch a rag. he wipes the smudge with the rag, pours more bleach into a bucket and drops the rag into the bucket. There is he writes a faint echo of the sucking and seeding and squelchy sound, as if heard through a funnel blocked with pebbles and dust.

And that's the path with ns save for a rather curious collo form from which not even nesting bird has been able to ring any meaning. I suppose we have to ask if Dobson was just making the whole thing up. We know there were times when he felt compelled to write a pamphlet, even when his head was empty of ideas. Perhaps this was one of those times, further light will no doubt be shed on the matter. With the publication of Aloysius nesting birds forthcoming study, Dobson's head, its innards, and what they reveal about the Colossus of 20th century pamphleteering. I had hoped to be invited to write an introduction to this book, but I was told in a dream that there would be no such invitation that nesting bird had never heard of me, and that my pretensions to Dobson scholarship were flimsy and pathetic and doomed, hard to argue with that belched and spat out as it was from the fiery more of a caco demon. Ahoy there, Frank writes, Tim thurn irritatingly Are you sure you're not confusing Dobson's caco demon with his cocoa demon. I recall reading somewhere that the Titanic pamphleteer once unscrewed the lid from a jar of cocoa and unleashed a ferocious sprite, which made his life a misery for about a week. everywhere he went, he found cocoa powder splattered in his path. Some of us wouldn't be too bothered by that. If it were me, I'd avail myself of a little plastic scoop and scoop up the cocoa powder, because I truly love cocoa and drink seven or eight mugs have it a day. But apparently, Dobson wasn't so fond, and he was only unscrewing the lid from the jar as research for his pamphlet notes upon the unscrewing of lids from jars out of print. He hadn't even bought the jar of cocoa. He was just wandering through the aisles in who Berman's food Hall hoping no one would spot what he was doing. I've never read that pamphlet, by the way. So is there any chance you could find a copy and transcribe it on your splendid website? Dear Tim, I replied, making up titles of spurious Dobson pamphlets. There's no way for a grown man to behave. I suggest you do something more useful with your life, such as projectile vomiting in the direction of Andy Burnham.

Andy Burnham, of course. With as a bit of shoma docs The story goes that she went out a hiking one morning and never came home. Some said she had a tryst with a Tinker and ran away with him to his Glen. Others spoke of a mysterious hot air balloon spotted in the sky above the goatee place around noon. The parish priest insisted he saw her waving from its basket, but he was an old and foolish man, and had had sundry hallucinations. There were those who mattered in the shadows of dark and desperate deeds. Before she left, the bent of shoma docks, ate an egg on toast and drank half a bottle of gin. She took the time to wash her dishes and place them on the drainer but she left her purse and keys and passport and engagement ring upon the kitchen table. Next to a saucer she used as an ashtray. Had she planned her disappearance? Or had she not? The bent fiance, the village wrestler, was much distraught in the market square by the horse trough. He beloved like a baby as night fell, and there was no sign of her. The Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman collected his tears in a cup and boiled them that she might see in the clouds of steam. A vision of the bent and her present were about but the steam vouchsafed naught but unreadable swellings. So the Whoo hoo hoo, the woman next eviscerated a few hens and read they're hot and bloody and trails again to no avail. The bent of shoma docs had vanished off the face of the earth. On the first anniversary, the village folk gathered in a barn and sang songs for her. They would have lit candles to had the parish priest not eaten them all in his madness. The songs they sang were the current popular hits of the village and its hinterland, with newly minted lyrics, some penned by the village wrestler who still wept every day. Oh, where is she now my show Murdoch's bent, I dabit my tears with a poor scrap of lint, if only the gods would let drop a hint of where she has gone to my shell Murdoch's bent the parish priest, whose chain was lengthened so he could just about reached the doorway of the bomb, tried to offer up a prayer for the immortal soul of the bent, but he forgot why he was there and blessed a couple of cows instead, the names of the cows were push gas and distefano. They were terrific cows. The pride of the village and the bent had oftentimes patted their heads and whispered in their ears in that sozzled way of hers. The commemoration was repeated in subsequent years, always with new songs from the village wrestler, still weeping copious Lee and with haphazard blessings from the parish priest. One time he managed to spark of lucidity and actually prayed for the bent so usually his benediction fell upon the cows, or a pack of lupins or even the chain that ensured he did not stray beyond the village. The Whoo Hoo Hoo wee woman refused to attend any of these ceremonies. But she had not forgotten about the bent of shoma docks, within her hovel among her dried up poisonous plants and toads and beetles and pins and pokey sticks she carried on her eldritch flummery in secret. She had somehow got hold of the bent passport, abandoned on the kitchen table and made dozens upon dozens of copies of the photograph there in on the photocopying machine in the village post office and plastered the walls of her hovel with the bent stared out at her sour gin soaked and half asleep. The Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman became fixated upon the bent smudge lipstick, convinced that the eerily shifting contours of the smudge in the passport photograph held the key to her vanishing. In some copies, the smudge resembled the subtropical peninsula. In others, it looked like a Heron. On the ninth anniversary, the villages eschewed the barn and gathered instead at the goatee place. The parish priests chain had been shortened after he frightened some swans in the summer just gone, and he stayed in his presbytery, sucking on lettuce leaves for their moisture. The villa Dressler dabbed at his tear stained eyes with his filthy scrap of lint and Sanger threnody.

my broken heart has the weight of lead. I can barely totter out of bed. How many more servings must I shed my Binti is gone She must be dead. According to the villages ad hoc legal system, these words counted as a binding declaration of the death of the shell Murdock's bent her home and her remaining personnel effect could now be burned in tire or trace of her expunged, and fireworks launched from the village green. The Wrestler could stop crying and seek a new in cammarata, even with a bent to reappear miraculously alive she would be invisible to the villages fated to roam among them as a ghost. Which, oddly is precisely what happened. At the very moment the final firework fizzled out and was squelched underfoot by the village posty. drunk and bedraggled and moth eaten the shell Murdoch's bent emerged from a shrub clump and staggered across the fields into the village. She smashed the window of the off licence, and hiked a bottle of vagabonds ruin from the display. But now she was dead to the villages, and nobody saw her. Nobody saved for the Whoo hoo hoo, the woman who inhabited a different lopsided plane, she beckoned to the bent and took her into her hovel, where the pair of them drank their fill and babbled about the bintz lipstick smudge long into the night. When morning came, they trudged army an arm to the bomb and whispered into the ears of pushed gas and distefano. And then the bent of shoma docs, and the Whoo hoo, hoo Dee woman, and the two terrific cows headed out of the village, across the field, and into the hills and up into the mountains up where the oxygen grew thin, and they passed. Oh, so happy beyond human can forevermore.

This is a quote from the maniac in the cellar sensation novels of the 1860s by Winifred Hughes, published in 1980. The reviewer gets carried away with his own sensational tale of Medea Blenkinsop or the October mist. But think of the shifts and perplexities of a wife with eight husbands being not only mysteriously married like Aurora Floyd to her noble husband's horse trainer, but also to the Emperor of China, who writes compromising letters by each mail. The more compromising issues also secretly married to the postman, who is of a suspicious temper, also, under peculiar circumstances, to the giant of a show that is coming to be set up at the fair in her neighborhood, also to a maniac who she keeps in the cellar. So Medea Blenkinsop or the optimist was a parody from the 1860s. We know the identities of six of the optimist Medea Blenkinsop husbands. There's the nobleman Blenkinsop himself, his horse trainer, the Emperor of China, the postman, the circus giant, and the maniac in the cellar, but one of the remaining two, Who were they? Over the years students of this kind of thing have toiled fruitlessly this should not surprise us as there are only certain kinds of toil which bear fruit, and even then much of the fruit will be rotten and eaten away by canker worms. At least in the orchards I frequent with my stick and my Lantern, and my birds scarifier. Lately, lightly however, evidence has come to light suggesting Medea Blenkinsop seventh husband was none other than the dwarf crew Pascoe confidante of the composer binder. How like Medea Blenkinsop to be married to both a giant and a dwarf at the same time. This revelation in a recent issue of the bulletin of Blenkinsop IANA, has already stirred up a Viper's nest of controversy in the field. When I say field referring to an academic field that of Blenkinsop studies, not the field adjacent to one of the orchards in which I skulk night breathing in their head, the scent of rotting pears and persimmons. across the field to reach the orchard gate, there are many cows living in the field, it is their home. And though after the blanket incident, the government has warned us of cow peril. I know the cows and the cows know me, and we've reached an understanding. And let me tell you here and now it's a fine, fine thing to have an understanding with cows of finest thing than all else under the boundless firmament. Anyway, much of the controversy centers upon the idea that Keira Pascoe is being counted twice, in that he is the same husband as the maniac trained in the cellar. This is clearly gibberish. Keira Pascoe was no maniac, at least not habitually. And it's absurd to suggest that binder a tritone among minnows in the world of symphonic composition would have had to creep down to the subterranean reaches of the Blenkinsop country pile every time he sought counsel from his confidante. In any case, what kind of composer would have a maniac for a confrere? Well, apart from Harrison Birtwistle, of course, no, I think we may safely assume that crew Pascoe was indeed a separate seventh husband. The case is compelling. We know Medea Blenkinsop and Keira Pascoe winter walking together along perilous clifftop pathways in all weathers she in her Cagoule and he in his amusing knitwear, we know they were clinches in grottoes. We know they swapped railway timetables, something Medea never did with her fourth husband, the suspicious postman. And we know that Pascal's torso was emblazoned with a tattoo Rocco in design, spelling out the legend. God helped me for I am besotted with Medea Blenkinsop and I worship the very spittle with which her lips are flecked. It is actually this last point the bolsters the otherwise worthless arguments of the anti capacity lists. When they ask with some justification, when Medea Blenkinsop slips ever spittle flecked Not a trace of spittle is ever depicted in any of the hundreds of portraits of her whether they be photographs or paintings or crayon scribbles or pencil drawings or primitivist door beings or mezzotints by the noted mezzotint is

Rex tint, or hyper realist line Oh cuts by the noted hyper realist line Oh cutter Rex hyper. It may be the battered by wild gales as they clung to one another upon a stormy clifftop, shouting their heads off to be heard above the screeching of hawks and golden kitty wakes. Aflac auto of spittle might have appeared fugitive Lee upon Medea Blenkinsop slip without a record tint there to record it for posterity. We shall never know. Nor it seems, are we likely ever to know the identity of husband number eight. The author of the essay in the bulletin admits as much when she writes. The more I've studied this kind of thing, the more convinced Have I become that Medea Blenkinsop Ace husband was but a phantom a chimera, an invention of her Madcap brain woven from whole cloth, a life sized rag doll she carted about with her to the opera and to cocktail parties, but just Oskar kokoschka did with the Alma mala doll he had made for him at the end of their affair, but I'm not 100% sure, even now, even now. Oh baby 24 hours from Tulsa.

Frank Key  24:09
Excuse me, yes. I'm Medea Blenkinsop. The oxygen optimist is a genuine Victorian parody of sensational literature. And it's true that Oskar kokoschka after his affair with Alma, Marla collapsed, was so obsessed with her that he had a doll of her maid, and took it to what took it to the opera and to parties. He ended up at a party actually beheading it, which is rather creepy, but there you go, that's Oskar kokoschka for you. Finally this week, annals of forensic science. He scraped the bones with zoster. He put frauded them with his bare rubber gloved fingers. He peered through a Coddington lens. He did tests pH climb vert vom throbbing z, et cetera. He broke for a cup of tea in the canteen. He sat alone reading a scientific bulletin, he examined graphs on screens. He checked the status of a number of petri dishes. He began to flag. It scribbled some notes in a pad. He poked at the bones with a cop stone fork. He slipped a bone into his pocket. He waited at the bus stop. It was raining. It was always raining. When he got home, he took the bone out of his pocket and added it to the pile by the fireplace. He opened the fridge and poured a glass of milk. He sat in an armchair and contemplated the pile of bones. There were bones from humans and dogs and rabbits, and cows and hens and pigs, and all sprays and hamsters and larks and goats and ostriches and bears and sheep and swordfish, and gold and deer and tanagers. He fetched a bale of fused wire from a cupboard. He tied the bones together with the wire. He worked slowly and with care. When he was done, he leaned the bone being against his mantle piece at an angle he thought in seussian. He plopped a hat on his head. Or Ohio, that Bogard are Bingu hobbema, he cried. He placed a cardboard box filled with sand at its lower talons as an offering. And he went out into his garden and sheltered from the rain under an awning and smoked a cigarette. Like Ayn Rand. He considered smoking to be man's victory over fire within the bone being grew hot, glittering in the fire light. And that's the end of hooting out for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it and learned a thing or two, and I'll be back with more of the same sort of stuff next week. Bye bye.
