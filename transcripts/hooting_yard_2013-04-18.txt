Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air in spending the weekend just gone in Amsterdam. I was of course following in the footsteps of the 20th century's most illustrious out of print pamphleteer. But whereas I went to the Dutch capital in the cause of art, Dobson's visit was occasioned by a challenge. Let me tell you all about it. so happened that one wet and windy morning in the 1950s. The pamphleteer was on his usual trudge along the towpath of the old canal, when a man sprang out at him from behind a splurge of cuckoo pint. The man was rotundone, diminutive and dressed all in green, with a little green pointy hat. He looked like a figure from a fairy tale, and those his name was not Rumpelstiltskin. It was something similar with the same number of syllables, but a slightly different combination of vowels and consonants. Such was the suddenness of the strange little man springing that Dobson was disconcerted, and would have toppled over splashing into the canal, had he not had the presence of mind to deploy a goon Fang technique he had recently mastered. In this exercise of the ancient mystic art, one is able to fix one's feet to the ground, as if magnetically for just long enough to avoid tapotement. Dobson swayed slightly. draft and heaven towns gubbins screech, the little fellow dressed in green, you were meant to topple over into the canal with a block that would have caused me much mirth, then you are confounded, shouted Dobson. What I do set the little man is to present those who confound me with a challenge. I challenge you to go to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, a city with a magnificent network of 17th century canals. And I further challenge you to walk alongside each and every canal in Amsterdam, from end to end, on both banks, trudging along back and forth, and to complete the task without once toppling into one or other of the canals. Do you accept my challenge? I do set Dobson immediately, without thinking, but he was not being unduly impetuous. He realized that the trip to Amsterdam could provide the opportunity for important research. It's so happens he explains. It so happens he explained that I am currently at work on a pamphlet devoted to the study of mariners with an exclusively fish based diet. I have heard that in the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet, there's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails. And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon, that can haul up the sails that can Swallow the moon. And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide. Hey, bring me more fish, throw it down by my side. And he wants so to belch but he's to fall to try. So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly in the port of Amsterdam in the port of Amsterdam. I would like to meet that sailor and interrogate him on his diet. I have often wondered, said the little man dressed all in green. If the port of Amsterdam is the port to which Emily Dickinson was referring in her in that magnificently sensual poem, wild nights where she writes futile the winds to her heart in Port done with the compass done with the chart. Perhaps that is something else I can research while I'm there, said Dobson. Dental man chuckled horribly. Ha you will be too busy wringing out your clothes. sopping wet from repeated toppings into one canal after another, he said, We shall see, said the pamphleteer.

Frank Key  05:11
Meet me again by this splurge of cuckoo pint in a week's time, said the little man. While you are in Amsterdam, I am going to sit in my right here and orgone accumulator and recite wild nights over and over again. So impassioned is the poem that I hardly dare think to what explosive pick the orgone energy levels will rise. It was Dobson's turn to laugh. reichian methods would not stop me from toppling into the many canals of the port of Amsterdam he said, but I have mastered the magnetic boots old technique of Dune Fang and will practice it with great assiduousness.

Frank Key  06:01
A week later, on a wet and windy morning, Dobson returned to the splurge of cuckoo pint on the towpath of the old canal. But of the strange little man dressed all in green, there was no sign. It was not until many weeks had passed that the pamphleteer learned from an article in the Emily Dickinson orgone energy digest, volume 21 number nine, the lethal concentration of what vilhelm Reich called d o r or deadly Argonne had caused a massive explosion and a mushroom cloud in the vicinity of the canal at precisely the time. Dobson was in Amsterdam. Although he never completed his work on mariners with exclusive fish diet, Dobson did write a pamphlet entitled on not toppling into any of the many canals of Amsterdam out of print. In spite of my mastery of goon Fang, he wrote, I took the extra precaution of smearing the soles of my Ruritanian bellringers boots, with an extremely viscous substance composed of glue and egg yolk and sand and gum and gunk and glue and powerful magnets retailed under the trade name. Gosh, it's very sticky. This proved a boon for oh no funny little men dressed all in green with green pointy hats sprang out at me as I trudged alongside each and every canal in Amsterdam. I was not prepared for the dazzling number of Dutch cyclists whizzing high speed along those very same path. I would certainly have toppled into canal off the canal off the canal, had my boots not been riveted to the ground. I count myself fortunate that I had read a rare copy of this pamphlet before my own weekend in Amsterdam, have I not I feel sure I too surprised by cyclists would have toppled into many canals, and returned home sopping wet. Just goes to show how valuable it can be to gain a familiarity with Dobson's more obscure works. I didn't incidentally seek out the sailor who eats only fish heads and tails, perhaps I should have.

We are doing our best to launch the Islamic Google Earth in the next four months. We are developing this service with the Islamic views we have in Iran. And we will put a kind of information on our website that would take people of the world towards reality. Our values in Iran, other values of God. And this would be the difference between bassier and the Google Earth which belongs to the ominous triangle of the United States, England and the Zionists. That was Iran's minister of communications technology. Mohammed Hassan Nami, announcing an exciting new website. As reported in The Guardian last week, it's called Basheer, which means spectator in Farsi. It's unclear in what physical sense the Islamic earth will differ from the non Islamic Earth mapped by Google. And I suppose we filthy kaphas will have to wait a few months to find out. But I was wondering if perhaps with that imperfect understanding of Western ways, the Mad mullahs may have mistaken the map shown in the opening credits of Game of Thrones for a satellite image from Google Earth. Westeros, where the various claimants to the Iron Throne fight and swear and have sex looks not unlike a somewhat misshapen mirror image of the British Isles. And where France ought to be is the red waist, where in dwell, savage horse riders known as the Dothraki. The Iranians would obviously be providing a helpful corrective and taking us towards reality, if their Basheer site shows us a proper map instead. Alternatively, of course, they might think that the Westeros map is the real one, and wonder why it doesn't appear accurately on Google Earth. But if the Iranians are right, and there is a competing version of reality based on Islamic principles, the rest of us should follow their lead. Why stop the parallel worlds of the Islam essence, that of the ominous triangle of the US England and the Zionist? Surely, there is a place to for what we call what we could call resonance, Earth. I have no idea what this would look like. But I think the team who run resonance, need to sharpen their wits and get to work on it. I will volunteer to do Greenland. I don't know exactly what I'll do to make take it closer to reality. But you can bet I will put unstinting effort into the task.

And then as we know, there came the time when tarlton the amateurs amateur came a Cropper. He was in pursuit of a shifty pastry Hawker. A man with a Barrow known to Gollum for long illite lanes. tarlton carried a torch, so we think it's bright beam ahead of him, both to avoid pits and puzzles, and in hopes that he might catch a glimpse of his quarry. But as the old saying has it, a torch in the hands of a nincompoop sheds no light. Incidentally, it's well worth your while to jot down old sayings and a notepad when you hear them. They can be invaluable in establishing rapport with countryside peasants. If you fall into conversation with such a person, you will discover that their utterances often consist of little else but old sayings strung together. By dropping in your own crumbs of rustic wisdom from time to time, you will be able to maintain conversational sparkle, and otherwise trying circumstances. And the beauty of it is you do not need to grasp the actual meaning of the old sayings you deploy. Consider, for example, the one we've just encountered. a torch in the hands of a nincompoop sheds no light on the face of it. This would seem to make little or no sense. Unless we presume the nincompoop has neglected to press the knob that lights the bulb of the torches carrying ban, but one must always avoid presumption as we learned from botsman third notebook lavinda series, say that saying to say a sophisticated urban person at a Swiss cocktail party, and you would face a series of Bruce questions, demanding that you clarify what you're saying. Say the same words to a peasant in the countryside. And as likely as not, he will suck thoughtfully on his piece of straw and nod before parrying with a saying of his own. Such as you can't melt a goat with a hammer. But wait wait, wait. Those are the words erupting inside your head dear listener. You see I know you only two Well, wait wait wait. Grateful as I am to be given tips on talking to present tips I will no doubt make use of when next I go trudging through an area of rustic squalor. I cannot let past the clear implication in your opening paragraph that Tarleton was a nincompoop. How can such things be? Talton? The amateurs amateur and nincompoop? Surely, Sir, you are in jest. Let me answer that. It's true enough that few persons have ever tried this earth whose brains were as acute as Carlton's indeed, hold his brain in the palm of your hand, and you would be astonished at its heft. It's worth noting in this context that you could if you wish to so hold Carlton brain is kept preserved in jelly in a jar in a display case in the lobby of his alma mater, Miss blossom partridges Institute for the education of frighteningly adept tinies. Make an appointment with the bursar Don a pair of gloves, and an attendant will open the display case and unscrew the lid from the jar. And with special tweezers, lift the brain from its protective jelly and allow you to hold it registering its heft for up to 60 seconds. The jar is clearly labeled with Townsend's name, so you will not mistake it for the brains of other alumni in other jellies in other jars in other display cases in the same lobby. Now, as true as it is that Tarleton was no dimwit, it's equally true that nincompoop worry is to be found in the most unexpected places. Here we might recall another app or suit of blocked summons from the fifth notebook lilac series. No man is all nincompoop he observed, but all men have an inner nincompoop. ever ready to emerge and flourish.

Frank Key  17:29
botsman compares this inner nincompoop to one may fly in a passage I recommend to your attention. His point is that even the most dazzlingly, sensible and spectacular minds may from time to time, and ephemerally exhibit the shore signs of nincompoop array. This is what I argue happened with Tarleton as he stumbled down an ill lit lane in pursuit of the shifty pastry Hawker. It was night a black night moonless and starless on account of a great shroud of cloud. The first incipient sign of tartans in a nincompoop was that he didn't wait until sunrise to go prowling after his quarry. Even the swiftest of shifty pastry hawkers cannot cover too much ground trundling a Barrow in the hours between dusk and dawn, and though the line would still be ill lit in the daylight, shaded as it was on either side by towering pines and Titanic cedars, yet there would be light enough for a man of tahltan piercing vision. Not so on this night. This black on Holy Night. unholy I say because it was the one night in the calendar year when in some goblins are let loose from their fetters, and a free to dash about or mystery fun havoc and mayhem. On this night, turns are attended wells poisoned, cows turned inside out. That at least is what the peasants believe. It's what they will tell you in the form of old sayings if you're willing to listen. The wise man stays a bed on st spiv x night, they will say or when Slovaks night comes around again, Bernard Dolly and slaughter a hen for all the startling heft of his brain tarlton the amateurs amateur did not heed such warnings. In fact, he dismissed the peasants old sayings as nonsensical babble. This was his undoing. This was his nincompoop burry. And so he went a stumbling along a nail lane in the night, sweeping the beam of his torch ahead of him. What was he to do? When all of a sudden, a goblin came swooping down and gobbled up the light and swallowed it, and then bounced it out in the form of thick black poison fumes. Poor Talton was terrified, and in his terror, he turned on his heel and ran from the Goblin. But he made only a half turn so, no sooner did he begin to flee. Then he crashed into a towering pine or a titanic cedar, and came a Cropper and the back given to his head, dislodged his brain within its cranium, and he fell to the ground and knew no more. He might have been dead. The peasant who found him at daybreak thought him so and being a grave digging peasant. He hoisted his spade from over his shoulder, and began to dig a pit in which to chuck the body. he whistled as he dug, an ancient rustic cocoon. And it was the sound of his whistling and of his digging, that woke Tarleton from this stupor. He robbed his bonds, but remembered nothing of what had happened during the black unholy night. He did not even remember that he had been pursuing a shifty pastry Hawker. Where am I? He asked, in an uncharacteristically weedy and quavering voice. What place is this? What day is it? Why are you digging a pit? The peasant did not reply. He was an obtuse peasant, and a peasant with a stubborn sense of purpose. Having began to dig a grave by the side of the lane in the shade of towering pines and Titanic cedars, nothing would stop him until he had shoved the body Six Feet Under, and covered it over with earth. And here was a second instance. Sorry, and here was a second instance of tarlton nincompoop, very close observation of the peasant countenance of the grim determination of his digging, might have persuaded Tarleton to get to his feet and Run, run away as fast as he could. But instead, he sat up and lit his pipe and listen to birdsong.

Frank Key  22:27
And he was still sitting and smoking and listening, when the peasant is digging down, threw down his spade and turned and picked up towels and in one huge hairy hand by the scruff of his neck, and chucked him into the pit and retrieved his spade and began to shovel spiteful after spiteful of soil and muck rich with worms over that amateurs amateur sprawled in the pit, and soon enough, buried, never to be found. The peasant stamped his great boots on the grave to smooth the ground and remove all trace of his digging, and then whistling. He went on his way.

Frank Key  23:16
Just one thing, if Totten was buried alive in an unmarked grave in an elite lane in an area of rustic squalor, how is it that his brain was retrieved and stored in a jelly in jelly in a jar in a display case in the lobby of Miss blossom partridges Institute for the education of frighteningly adept tinies Ah, I could tell you a thing or two about Miss blossom Partridge and certain members of her staff, our institute that would curdle the blood in your veins, things innocent ears should never hear. Remember the old saying, ignorance is better by far when you see a brain in jelly in a jar.

Notice for sale in a shop window or tungsten grebe. It was a small model grebe fashioned out of tungsten, according to the handwritten tag attached to it by a piece of broke brown string The price was illegible. The shop was shot. I passed on down the street. A week later passing the same spot. I glanced at the window display and saw the tungsten grebe was gone. I was not emotionally devastated. I had wanted to find out the price and depending, and depending upon what that was, I might have bought the tungsten grieb and put it on one of my windows cells, but I did not hanker for it. So again, I've passed on down the street. That was 17 years ago. I cannot get that tungsten grip out of my head. It's image seems etched on the inside of my eyelids. It's the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning. The last thing I think of with my head on the pillow as I drift off to sleep at night, in my dreams and daydreams. I'm standing at the shop window, gazing at the tungsten grieb. trying to decipher the price. scribbled so inelegantly on the tag. Oh, tungsten grebe. Why do you haunt me so? That could be the first line of a song, couldn't it? It's a pity. I have not a musical bone in my body. If I did, I could write the rest of the song and give it a tune and sing it to the accompaniment of strummed Banjo and mournful bassoon and Bosque outside the site where the shop used to be on the street I used to pass along, and then I might exorcise The Phantom of that gorgeous, gorgeous tungsten grebe.

And that's the end of this week's episode of hooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it, and found it entertaining. And I'll be back with some more stuff next week. Meanwhile, you like might like to visit the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org and while you're there, you can buy some books or by a by a lapel accoutrement, badge. hooting your badge or you could just send me some money, any of those things, or you could just sit and read nine years worth of, of babblings most of which have been read on here. Not all but most. So yes, you can go and do that and have a good week. Bye bye.
