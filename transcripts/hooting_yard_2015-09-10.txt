Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. Now in it's 11 and a half the year so this is the new season of hunting yard. I can't promise that all the material will be new because some of it will have appeared on earlier shows a case in point being around what I'm about to read one of the things that happens when you've been doing a show for as long as this isn't the world changes around you. And since since hosting yard first began back in 2004, we've had two new Pope's which means that the the much loved hooting yd pontiff mnemonic is out of date. It was briefly updated with to include Benedict, but there's been another new pope since and so the the original pontiff mnemonic is now out of date. So I'd like to read to you an updated version which is correct at the time of broadcast unless we hear any weird news from the Vatican. Those of you who don't know about the pontiff, mnemonic let me just briefly explain. There comes a time in most of our lives when you're walking down the street minding your own business. And someone comes up to you and says always name all the Pope's in chronological order from St. Peter onwards to the present incumbent. Well, that happens to me, I don't know if it happens to you. Now, keeping in mind hundreds of Pope's is quite difficult. So what I did was I devised a handy mnemonic to help you remember all the Pope's so all you need to do is remember the initial letters of each of the words I'm about to declaim and that will help you to remember the name of the pope related to the initial letter of the word. You'll get the idea for example, the first pope was Peter. The second Pope was Linus. So here it is the updated hooting yard pontiff mnemonic plastic Lantern, astounding canal, enormous ailing squirrel, torn hessie and phosphorescent, armbands, stampeding Elks veins zombies, curious and likely pawns. asbestos flap, custard, laughable soup, stinking Dennis felt extremely cantankerous more more hens.

so if you memorize that, which should be fairly straightforward, then you'll be able to apply the initial letters of each word to the Pope's and be able to recite an entire list in chronological order of all the Pope's of the Roman Catholic Church, which just reminds me to let you know I probably let you know this already that should you find yourself in the Vatican City in need of cash. When you go to an ATM machine, you'll find that the default language is the Latin. Here's a little poem Dave Dee, dozy beaky, mechon tick. One Night in the Woods encountered a wick. She was a bricklaying witch and she carried a hold. She asked which of you is blinking? Which wincon which node? b he replied on behalf of the five that trio is fictional but we are alive. They were invented for verse by Eugene field. With these words, the five sons fate was sealed the witches countenance became twisted with hate, and she cried. I'm fields childhood sweetheart captivity Wait, he abandoned me occur the dog. Yet My name is immortalized in his Auto biolog love affairs of a biblio maniac and then mad and she's still started to whack Dave Dee, dozy and beaky and Mick and tich with brick after brick after brick, until in the word in the dead of the night, the soul of each popstar took heavenward flight. Their mortal lives gone by sat next to God dispatched by the bricklaying which with her hold

It's entirely true that Eugene field, the author of winking blink in a nod, among other poems, had a childhood sweetheart called captivity. Wait. It's a great name, I think. And you will know that if you read a book, which is drew out on the first of October, I'm very pleased to announce his last being published. It's Mr. Keyes shorter, potted brief, brief lives, published by constable vailable. From all bookshops, and online book retailers. I won't mention any by name. And I thought as a special treat to hooting odd listeners, I'd read the book to you or lots of it anyway. extract from my set of shorter potted, brief, brief lives. The idea behind the book was as follows. Some of you will be familiar with john Aubrey his brief lives a marvelous book from the 18th century 17th century. Good god, I can't remember. Anyway, um, and it's the first sort of first book in English literature, which really takes autobiography, a biography story, as it's model. And they're fantastic little brief, brief potted biographies of the various people of that era. Many of whom john Aubrey knew personally, but not all. And I thought, well, I'll do an updated modern version. But then I realized that, you know, some books are basically unimprovable and and they would just look foolish, if I tried to copy john Aubrey. So I thought if I can't outdo him in brilliance, I can outdo him in brevity. And what I decided to do was to take one little fact or anecdote or quotation or something, for each of my subject, they're not short enough to fit into Twitter's What is it 180 characters or whatever it is, I wouldn't know because I don't use Twitter. But they're all very short. And you won't actually learn much about the entire life of any of my subject, but you'll learn one thing, at least about them. So, I'm gonna read, I'm gonna read some of my book to you. And don't forget to go to a bookshop on the first of October, or log in online and you can you can, you can already buy the book pre order it online from online people. Anyway, without further ado, here are some of the brief brief lives. Lascelles Abercrombie, English poet 1881 to 1938.

In it were vessels and streams of light, which entered and exuded through the pools. The vessels were charged with liquors of various color Have intense brilliancy and transparency. Some of these fluids were water, milk, wine and fire. Every motion of Adam's body produced ineffable harmonies. Every creature obeyed Him. Nothing could resist or injure him. He was taller than men of this time, His hair was short, curled and approaching black. He had a little down on his upper lip. In his stomach was a clear fluid like water in a crystal bowl, in which tiny eggs develop themselves, like bubbles in wine, as he drove with the ardor of divine charity. When he strongly desired that others should unite with him in the work of praise, he deposited some of those eggs, which hatched and from one of them emerged his consort, Eve. john adams, American politician and President 1735 to 1826 the second President of the United States had a pet dog named Satan.

The author insisted that the critic justify his review, Wilson confessed that he couldn't recall what he'd written, whereupon Richard Adams recited the entire thousand word piece from memory. When Wilson still failed to explain himself, he was bombarded with letters, telephone calls, and a cassette recording until he begged Adams to desist. Aladdin, Arabian folk tale hero according to Thomas de Quincey in the tale of Aladdin, quote, after the possession of the lamp has been once secured by a pure accident, the story ceases to move. All the rest is a mere record of upholstery, from how this saloon was finished today, and that window on the next day, with no fresh incident whatsoever. Albert, German Prince Consort of England 1819 to 1861. Prince Albert was deeply involved with the Great Exhibition of 1851 and counted it as a personal triumph. On the fifth of July, he persuaded Queen Victoria to join him in a visit where they mingled with the crowds. exhibitors were obviously keen to bring their wares to the attention of the royal couple. And at one point, Victoria and Albert were confronted by a gathering of dentists brandishing sets of false teeth in their hand and waving them in the faces of the startled couple.

She became frightened at some fancy danger, caught hold of the reins and back the carriage off the bridge down a precipice dashing them to pieces.

The last race he rode was on Tommy tittle mouse at Lewis. He been ill all the week and was advised to go home.
