Frank Key  00:00
We're asking for this week. We want to we want to try earler is it di Bay or dab? adapt for a digital digital AB service

Unknown Speaker  00:15
audio podcast,

Frank Key  00:16
digital audio broadcast service, overhaul the website increase the range. According to Richard, he thinks that that means he will be able to listen to the resonance on the wireless in Kidderminster

Unknown Speaker  00:29
and Colchester.

Frank Key  00:30
I don't mean wireless do i mean transistor radio? A lot of people listen. What people have a right at radios these days. Modern boxes,

Unknown Speaker  00:40
yeah, with Bluetooth, a stream. They straight stream stuff.

Frank Key  00:44
Yeah, but I thought the whole point of the extension of the range was that people could listen to the radio, not just in central London. Yes. You can get the computerized version around the world, which is what people do. Yes. But if you want to listen on your Bakelite wireless set that still works that you Your, your grandparents owned in the 30s you need when you need to be in central London. But if we can extend the range, you'll be able to listen to it in Kidderminster I have no idea where and Colchester

Unknown Speaker  01:21
and possibly Prague, painter, painter

Unknown Speaker  01:26
certain anyway, we're passing now we've,

Unknown Speaker  01:29
we've it's time for the

Unknown Speaker  01:32
log in, we lost some flooding into hooting yard on the S Hoot

Frank Key  01:38
is now hosting yard on the air this segment of the show.

Unknown Speaker  01:43
And that's a fun way to

Frank Key  01:44
devote some of that time to telling you more of the exciting items you can buy in the auction. But first I'm gonna read you some Haiku. Please. JOHN loves hi john, as we learned a short while ago, hates them and thinks they're pretentious twaddle. And I was reminded,

Unknown Speaker  02:03
not necessarily while

Frank Key  02:04
ago, I wrote some while ago, I wrote some haikus and I'm gonna read all of them now, which won't take very long because there's four and as you know, they're very short. A bog beyond the viaduct in the downpour say that was a haiku, a bowl

Unknown Speaker  02:24
or a bog, a bog.

Unknown Speaker  02:27
Can you can you tie see the rules of Haiku? Certainly, for those who are listening who don't.

Frank Key  02:34
You can look them up on Wikipedia.

Unknown Speaker  02:37
Five syllables, I don't use Wikipedia. Look, I'm not even looking at my computer, five syllables, seven syllables, and then five syllables, more or less, although that is really a recent invention because it's 5575. Yeah, what did I say? 545575. Is that special? Well, that is something which has originated in the 20th century basically like bamboo and other people who wrote Haiku traditionally, were somewhat more lenient on the syllabic rules, but five syllables in the first line seven syllables in the second, five syllables in this and in the final line, it must in some way refer to nature, seasons or the natural world. And it must also have a kiru, which is a Japanese word for cutting, so it must have a cut or a change at some point during the Haiku to donate. You know, sort of flip back some sort of like resolution, some sort of sea change during the poem. Those are the rules of Haiku I've learned through Shaka not even reading Wikipedia. Yeah, I've

Frank Key  03:35
learned in the last minute that I haven't written any Heiko. What I've written,

Unknown Speaker  03:41
I just thought it was the first bit 575 bit not just

Frank Key  03:46
a pretty opera face what I've written not even what I've written better three line Palin's Dobson axes escrow trial, equity swap, scribbling twaddle. That's another one. And there's two more a hobgoblin on sawdust bridge eating a sausage. And finally, tiny Enid flooring a nerdly Well, and kicking is heavy.

Unknown Speaker  04:17
I like that one.

Unknown Speaker  04:18
That's amazing. I'd say two of those definitely a bog that's the natural world and a bridge natural world as well. Eating a sausage sausage is the cue because you're like sausage work. That's a change. hobgoblin with a sausage. I haven't heard of that since the last pull the plug

Unknown Speaker  04:33
since last.

Frank Key  04:35
How is a bridge the natural because in first River.

Unknown Speaker  04:38
You can't have a bridge without a river flowing motorway. Well, Frank,

Unknown Speaker  07:17
not gonna get us FC Grande. Lizzie,

Unknown Speaker  07:19
as my dad once said to me when I was a young boy, it takes two people to auction. I think he meant two people to tango.

Frank Key  07:28
Why would he say it takes two people to auction?

Unknown Speaker  07:31
Now what was he? I think we were at walks and I think we're in a livestock auction. And I thought we're going to the library. We know I thought we were going to the library. It was all very upsetting. But DJ BPM, I mean, one of the great resonance DJs you may have heard her from her show grime for the unconverted who doesn't like grime.

Frank Key  07:56
There's some grime related thing in the auction. Yes, there is a grind. I don't know what it is. I don't know what grinding Mater. I don't know about grind. Is it some kind of subculture? Anyway, there's some kind of grind related item. Well, while you're babbling I will look up the you

Unknown Speaker  08:18
frankly is gonna go on you're gonna I am so so DJ BPM, who is the queen of grime has recorded a charity single for resonance FM. I mean, that is just extraordinary what you can buy. You can actually buy it. I bought it this morning. It is of course completely Wonderful. Well, it's donations. You can pay anything Why 49 p

Unknown Speaker  08:50
how do they know if they're gonna like it and if you play it,

Unknown Speaker  08:53
I'm gonna play it right now. I'm gonna play it right now is about to get hot in here because the windows are closed.

Unknown Speaker  12:10
Welcome back to pool the hooting opera yard and this is resonance feminists fundraising week and I'm in the studio My name is Richard Scott, myself the door that ghost I'm joined by Frankie and Johnny seven and that was of course the resonance FM charity single recorded by DJ BPM, I should say the elegant and tenacious DJ BPM, and she describes a single as an electronic audio expression soundscape influenced by grime dubstep world turmoil and the forces of nature. I heard a rattlesnake hissing Johnny seven heard a UFO landing Frank, what did you hear in the soundscape wasn't listening.

Frank Key  12:51
I was trying to find the I mentioned that there's a grime related item on the auction. And so I wasn't listening to that I was looking for it and I found it. So I can tell you that you listener listeners can be it for I grant a guided tour of East London grime landmarks

Unknown Speaker  13:21
are such things.

Frank Key  13:24
But well wait, listen, go on the tour Listen, a guided tour. Around the grime landmarks of East London join Derek warmsley. On a days days walking tour goodness me of the locations that gave birth to London's underground MC culture. The tour itinerary will include locations of MC battles, estates that nurtured the crews and the labels, record shops. locations that gave rise to London's most original music, original music of the millennia

Unknown Speaker  14:06
of the millennia with the millennials any 15

Unknown Speaker  14:12
landmarks on that day. Or they're very spread out that you may have to walk from the street.

Unknown Speaker  14:19
Probably a lot of lampposts with flowers around it

Unknown Speaker  14:25
for cycling accident. No.

Frank Key  14:28
But anyway, look, if you're interested in the point I was trying to make. I was trying to be helpful. Yes, if you're interested in grime, which I'm not I have no no understanding whatsoever of what I've just read out to you. But if you're interested in grime, you can bet and the money. See this is the point the money doesn't go to john warmsley derek derek warmsley, it goes to resonance. And that means that instead of listening to grime, weight, you can listen to grime on resonance apparently, but You can listen to all sorts of other things as well, including old age pensioners of cyclists, opera, opera,

Unknown Speaker  15:09
plug pulling, short stories,

Frank Key  15:12
short stories and all sorts of other things. An immense range of program makers who as a Baxter mentioned when he was on this show what seems like several hours ago now no one gets paid for at all do out of love. Absolute explosive love

Unknown Speaker  15:34
or meant mental illness.

Frank Key  15:38
Love for mental illness. Well is the love of mental ill Yes, we could talk to humor.

Frank Key  15:44
humor, not one of the medieval one. No, but

Unknown Speaker  15:46
it feels in today's world. Richard, we

Frank Key  15:49
could discuss the maybe evil humor. Yes, please.

Unknown Speaker  15:51
Please. Before we discuss the medical humors I claim as AI with the humans of the eye, I would just like to say if you like grime, and you like resonance, I love Dr. Frank low scrape it, why not download the resonance FM charity single go to band camp or go to fundraiser.resonance.fm? Or do what I did this morning and Google resonance FM charity single and click the first link that came up and I downloaded it for a donation.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Okay, that's right. Yes. Because what? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  16:24
because, well, because I was gonna say, I, I can't expect listeners to do what I have not okay. On the subject.

Frank Key  16:36
I'm just trying to think about you can't expect your listeners to do what you do not

Unknown Speaker  16:42
know, you know, best foot forward. Oh,

Frank Key  16:44
I see. Yeah. I mean, what you're saying is that you can't expect any listener to resonance to ever do anything that you yourself wouldn't do. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  16:56
there's a lot of things I would do, Frank. I have been a young man. I have been a not so young man. I've been a child. I'm still

Unknown Speaker  17:05
living. Have you been an old man?

Unknown Speaker  17:08
yet? Not yet. Johnny seven and a young woman?

Unknown Speaker  17:12
Have you been?

Unknown Speaker  17:14
Like, don't kick once my sister made me wear her cropped up when she was babysitting. And I kind of cried does that count as being a young woman?

Unknown Speaker  17:23
I know.

Unknown Speaker  17:32
dressing.

Unknown Speaker  17:33
Speaking of crop tops,

Unknown Speaker  17:35
no. I'm trying this.

Unknown Speaker  17:42
Thanks, john. Oh, but

Frank Key  17:44
yes, it's my half hour and I'm gonna hand it over to Johnny seven to read out whatever it is. He wants to read. And

Unknown Speaker  17:50
I just thought this was an interesting auction item. It's it's a half day. Well, it's only half day. That's not very good. That's

Frank Key  17:58
half the time you spent wandering around looking for grand rounds.

Unknown Speaker  18:01
That wasn't me. Oh, yeah. That's a whole day. Yeah, that's why then then the next half day you can have a songwriting and recording session at Plato's studios kindly donated by production company Titanyen music with a tight titanium titanium. Is this half days recording session? Six hours. That's quite long. That's like a whole world if you get five or six tracks recording studio in full them I wonder why we follow them that is. Plato studios is a private studio, used by some of the world's top songwriters and recording artists, including Wayne Hector nowise. The beyond say of scott brown brackets One Direction Nicki Minaj Claude Kelly, still no idea. Oh, Willie Nelson brackets Jessie J Britney Spears, Britney Spears

Frank Key  19:07
Lana Del Rey Ali Mears and many more. To do not Britney Spears is an anagram of Presbyterians.

Unknown Speaker  19:16
I would be I did the winning bidder can I ever record a well known song or have helped with writing and recording their own song? For more information on Plato's studios visit Playtech studios.co.uk bid now to avoid missing out on this unique opportunity unlike bid for that so

Frank Key  19:37
I could spend six hours setting that little song about timing Enid to music

Unknown Speaker  19:43
Do you remember when they used to be like on train stations and that there used to be little booze like photo booths but where you could record stuff and it came out as a seven inch vinyl record?

Frank Key  19:53
I certainly do. Do you not remember Brighton Rock Richard, a young record rottenberg Casa record for his sweetheart. But he has one of his little psychopathic tantrums in the middle of Yeah, and slams his fist on the machine and there. Luckily it means that he entered, he makes the record jump, because he's about to tell her that he's basically a psychopathic gap. When she hears it, she goes, and he says, You want me to say I love you. I love you. I love you see, and that's the end of the film. Which, in fact, is not as good as the ending of the book, which is much darker because in the book, she she's got the record that he's cut for her. And she's taking it home and he and then it ends with the lines to face the worst horror of all. In other words that she finds out that he didn't matter at all. Anyway, yes, do I do remember those little boobs? And I remember because I remember that when I saw the young Dickie in Brighton Rock, I didn't think what on earth is he doing? This is a very unusual thing. Because I recognize the the technology to them. They went back to the places where dead technology goes but

Unknown Speaker  21:17
that was so quiet. No, but they kind of I did when I was very, very young. I remember doing one and I wish I had that record. I wonder what happened to it. We probably just throw it away.

Unknown Speaker  21:29
I wish I could hear

Frank Key  21:31
I wish he could play on this show.

Unknown Speaker  21:35
Right now let's try and recreate

Unknown Speaker  21:36
I've got no idea I was like

Unknown Speaker  21:39
what would you have sung?

Unknown Speaker  21:41
I don't think we did sing we might have just it was me my brother I think I think we probably didn't sing the flowers. Yeah, exactly. We're just mucking about

Unknown Speaker  21:51
brother. Come on. JOHN. Ash. Ah, come on. JOHN.

Unknown Speaker  21:57
Blimey, Crikey love dying

Unknown Speaker  21:58

Frank Key  22:03
Can I get interrupted to say that? I think it would be a fantastic new show on resonance. If john as john as the young john and Richard as the young john Brava dedicados of dialogues of the young john and the young john Java in kind of fifth postwar due to a bit more

Unknown Speaker  22:34
level john, something else same.

Unknown Speaker  22:38

Unknown Speaker  22:49
JOHN. JOHN,

Unknown Speaker  22:51

Unknown Speaker  23:38
Inside a squat mind

Unknown Speaker  24:25
imagine

Unknown Speaker  24:35
inside a swatch

Unknown Speaker  25:06
Inside each other's eyes

Unknown Speaker  25:15
inside each other's arms

Unknown Speaker  26:20
before that, this is from 1975. That was Fox. From 1975 imagine me imagine you the lovely new shift Fox who brilliantly is a mother of a Dr. Ben Goldacre? He of the bad science?

Frank Key  26:39
Sorry, splendid facts is did you know that? Andrew? whatever his name Andrew Lincoln, who is the lead actor in Walking Dead, The Walking Dead is the son in law. Ian Anderson of dress right.

Unknown Speaker  26:59
Now, I didn't know that.

Unknown Speaker  27:01
That's another splendid fact. Welcome back, resonance. Baker. Welcome back to resonance FM. Ben Goldacre

Unknown Speaker  27:10
originally writes for The Guardian, but I won't hold that against him.

Unknown Speaker  27:13
Welcome back to resonance, FM. Three minutes,

Frank Key  27:18
I think it's the end of the hooting yard segment of the show. And once again, the auction item, which is you can have your name or the name of a loved one, not czajkowski written into the title of out of print pamphlet by Dobson the pamphlet to be featured in a specially written story by me and you can beat you will be invited to the studio for the show on which I do the live broadcast including the story and then I'll take you for a cup of tea with perhaps oat milk in it if you so desire. Or but probably not. I'll take you for a cup of tea next door afterwards. So you are not according to the fundraiser website fundraiser.resonance.fm there's a reserve price of 60 pounds. I don't know what that means. Does that mean that's the minimum bid? Someone's better tenor, but apparently you got enough. Not enough. You've got to up it by 50 quid

Unknown Speaker  28:24
that's quite a lot. Frank is worth his weight in mahogany and Dragon's teeth, hen's teeth even. So, I think Hannah actually have tiny teeth. It's very rare. It's very rare, but sometimes you get a genetic deformity on it ends

Frank Key  28:44
up dramatically deformed. have teeth are genetically deformed carrots, eyes and ears.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
I've got a problem at home with hens in the skirting board

Unknown Speaker  28:58
that you never do. That would be awful. They'd be packing your ankles while you're doing the Hoover in in Putney. That's it. That's

Unknown Speaker  29:03
the way I think we're finishing. I think cafe culture is starting next.

Unknown Speaker  29:10
I mentioned to Moby

Unknown Speaker  29:11
Jean segway lanes when

Frank Key  29:15
we've been joined by cafe calculus.

Unknown Speaker  29:18
We've been kicked out they're gonna they're gonna kick us out physically. Oh.
