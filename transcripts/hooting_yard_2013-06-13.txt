was feeling quite despondent and then that last song that Tron played as perked me right up, everything is sunshine, I feel very happy. My name is Frank key. This is the jolly Happy Hunting yard on the air for this week. Now I'm gonna read you some stories and such like, as I normally do, you must be that fire precess everyone is talking about. That's a line from Game of Thrones that I've been hoping to use in everyday conversation. I could of course just say it next time I find myself leaning insouciantly against the mantelpiece at a Swiss cocktail party to any woman within earshot. But even I realize how foolish that would be. Know, what I need to do is to find the right media, one where not only can I fall naturally into conversation with a Fire Priestess, but one where she's a common subject of discussion among the BM pen song. This is very unlikely to happen in my bailiwick, where I do not think I've ever met a Fire Priestess, and nor have I heard anybody talking about one. So to be fair, most of the people who live around here speaking barbaric incoherent grumps, if they speak at all.

Surely after writing the above paragraph, I decided to immerse myself in some serious Fire Priestess research. I took the phone off the hook, Drew down the blinds, barricaded the door and crouched in the middle of the living room in the stance botsman calls the alert chaffing see the third notebook lilac series, concentrating hard for 20 seconds as recommended. I was then able to proceed. I put on my shoes and my Tyrolean sports casual jacket and barricaded the door and pranced off to the railway station, where I bought a ticket to Schubert ness. using the botsman method, I had ascertained that the ethics coastal town was likely melior to find everyone babbling about a Fire Priestess, and indeed a Fire Priestess herself. I would then I would then be able to meet with her and deploy the line from Game of Thrones to do so had become my dearest wish to the point I suppose of mania. shibori ness is notable for its proximity to the large Ministry of Defense facility at pigs Bay, and also for its bottomless Vita pit of which I have spoken about previously. As I disembarked from my train, I was confident that my blockman inspired hunch was correct. And I immediately pranced into the railway station canteen to commune with shibori netflights who I felt sure would have no other topic on their lips than the presence in the town of a Fire Priestess. I bought a cup of tea, a sausage snack and a slice of fried cake and sat down at one of the tables, cocking my ears. To my bitter disappointment in the time it took me to munch my sausage and fruitcake and to drain my tea cup. I heard Not a single mention of a fire precess you Kip badgers football Ruskin's fours clever Gera the weather these seem to be the hot topics in shrubbery nest that day. I crashed out of the door and went prancing through the street down to the beach. Nobody I past had a word to say about a fireplace. Death. I wonder if perhaps I might draw her to me by setting fire to a waste bin. I found one overflowing with paper and cardboard and seaside detritus and ignited it with my lighter. As I hoped, a woman came rushing towards me. She was dressed in the uniform of a shoe barinas seaside community support patrol officer. But I knew deep down in my gut, that it was merely a disguise. I opened my mouth about to speak the magical words, you must be the five precepts that everyone's talking about. But before I could do so, she unleashed a taser and zapped me deep down in my gut. As I lay writhing on the ground, panting and frazzled, she doused the flames in the waste bin. But here is the curious thing. She did so by making the tiniest gesture, a significant sweeping movement of her hand through the air, so quick, it was virtually imperceptible. Only a fire preset could do that, I thought before losing consciousness. When I came to I discovered I'd been bundled into the freight van of a train, and it was just pulling out of shubhra station, pinned to my Tyrolean sports casual jacket was a civic proclamation, banning me from ever setting foot in the town again. I staggered to my feet and peered out of the train window. And there on the platform

I saw, waving at me her flaming red pre-raphaelite tresses blowing in the breeze, eyes pools of fathomless, inky black witchery. The shrubbery ness, seaside community support patrol officer, only I knew her for what she truly was. But as I gazed, the train gathered speed, and soon she was fed a speck in the distance. And then she was gone.

Looking back on my life, I believe one of the greatest challenges I ever had to face was when I found myself in possession of a glass of leaks. It was the first so far the only time fate brought me to such a path. So it's no wonder that I was at sixes and sevens. And let me assure you that I had many, many more leaks than six or seven. I had a glut of them, and I did not know what to do. with hindsight, I can see clearly that I was wholly unprepared. But that was not something I wish to admit to myself in my vigorous youth. Living as I did in a fool's paradise. I thought there was nothing I could not achieve. In spite of my perplexity, I was confident I could find some use for a glass of leaks before they began, as cruel nature demanded to rot. I tried out various schemes, some seemingly sensible, others wild and unhinged. No matter what I did, I was making no serious depredations to the glut. The leaks I had were countless, so I did not attempt to count them. The glut remained the glut. Then one day Excuse me. Then one day, I received news of an impending visit from my spiritual advisor, lifestyle coach and tobogganing partner, the dwarf Pascoe. Heaven forfend, I thought that he should have to fight his way through a glass of leaks simply to reach the armchair I reserved for him and then the radiator crew Pascoe suffered dreadfully from the cold. That's it was that I cobbled together a total pulley system and hoisted each and every leak in the glut up from the floor. Sorry dangled from the ceiling.

Frank Key  10:07
Unfortunately, so low was my ceiling in that place at that time, that I being taller than a dwarf found myself when standing in the midst of dangling vertical leat. My vision was occluded and I had to drop all my way through them blindly. No such terrors for the dwarf crew Pascoe, who sailed past me, sat himself in the armchair, and as I had hoped he would dispense advice. As your spiritual advisor, he said, I have nothing to say. As your tobogganing partner. I note we are due to make a rundown on mighty cravat next Thursday. And as your lifestyle coach, let me just say that I'm deeply impressed by your innovative interior design initiative. A room with hanging leaks in profusion is both peak want and leaky. And is that not a combination anyone sensitive to interior design would kill for I blundered against the dado rail doing myself a mystery, but I had to acknowledge his wisdom. Somehow later, of course, the leak did rot. But by then I had made a name for myself as a peak wanton, leaky interior designer, and I never looked back.

If you visit the hooting our website at hooting yard.org, you can see a picture of me or the narrator of the story, blundering his way through a plethora of dangling leaks. That's on the front page at the moment. May it will vanish eventually, but it will be in the archive do go to the website it's quite a while since I have encouraged listeners to go there and buy paperback books or ebooks and or even just send me some money. You know, those are good things to do. So do visit the site, there's so much rain, it will keep me busy probably for the rest of your life. One would expect a person called norm to conform to a norm. So it came as a surprise to me when I met someone called norm whose conduct was anything but normal. Indeed, it was so far off or anybody might consider normal that I would happily sign an affidavit to the effect that norm was absolutely bonkers. Norm, I said to norm some little while after making his acquaintance, and having witnessed a plethora of oddities. It seems to me that your parents norm when naming you chose whatever the nominal opposite of the most used is whatever possessed them to W norm, where you perhaps normal as a babe in arms, only laterally striking out in wild and unhinged directions.

sigismund has unlatched his pig door said norm as he rise within his straight jacket. You see what I mean? his reply made no sense whatsoever. He was a very crying companion. I am as loyal as the most loyal of puppies to my friends and acquaintances. But I think I might have broken things off with norm through sheer exasperate. Were it not that I too was in suede in a straight jacket and shared with norm the padded cell from which neither of us are ever likely to be released.

My oldest sister recently out of the trunk crammed with stuff from 40 years ago when she moved to the United States, it had remained unopened century moved to her present address some 30 years ago. Within among other things, she found a notebook containing some early writings by Mr. Key. So here is the beginning of a piece called n that hyphen, capital E, lowercase n. I should point out that I have absolutely no memory of it at all. I don't remember writing it. I don't remember anything about it at all. The Notebook is undated, but I would guess it is from sometime in the mid 1970s. That being so it's no surprise to find it imbued with the earnest seriousness of team personhood. Though I'm pleased to note that it includes a hint of the love of words for their own sake, make of it what you will. I'm reading this from the actual manuscript in my teenage handwriting. So I'll do the best I can. N by Mr. K. 40 odd years ago. When it happened, no one was prepared, and there was chaos. The whooping cough puff, envelop the sky, and the trim effect took place. Pure, utter chaos. The sun was blotted out, as the distant clouds rushed over. Sorry, as the disease clouds rushed over chaos, the extinction of humanity of flora and fauna of life. They should have known said trond Oh, yes, they we should have known but they we didn't. And the Stark, bitter unreal reality of it all took place. And then everyone knew pole to pole. hole to hole. Mold tomorrow, man, disease is rife. The headlines, hypothetical headlines might say if they were to exist, millions of years wiped out a timescale destroyed. Our planet annihilated the lives singled out, vast, enormous.

Frank Key  18:46
I found that I or I was sent to me by my sister and I read it on Sunday. And clearly, I was completely discombobulated by reading it. Those of you who go to the website know that I write something pretty much every day. Occasional lapses but hooting yard is more or less a daily blog. And so I read in that was the opening paragraph apparently, according to my sister, it goes on for dozens of pages. She's gonna send it to me, so you may end up hearing the rest of it. But I found myself unable to write a word. And two days two entire days Monday and Tuesday passed without any updates to hooting yard, which I know will have caused great distress among my readers and listeners. Because I thought last year when I was battling out 1000 words a day, I thought I'd proved at least in my own case, that writer's block is merely A convenient myth we tell ourselves so we can spend more time staring out the window in blissful idleness. But it does appear that such writer's blocks do exist even for me. All I had to do was read something unwritten 40 years ago and I'm entirely Shut up. But I think I've hit upon the nub of the problem. contained in the text of a. contained in the text event is that resounding trio of sentences, pole to pole, hole to hole, mole to mole. We agree these words haunt me. They make no sense or at least no sense that I can ascertain some 40 years after I wrote them. But I'm strangely exercised by the thought that somewhere along the line, I took a wrong turning. And it's sentences like these that I ought to have been writing for all these years. Coal to coal, Soul to Soul, bowl to bowl. It occurs to me of course that had I stuck to my guns I may not have gained the listenership or readership I have, such as it is. There's only so far one can take that method. And one need not take it far at all before boring the reader or listener to stupefaction but it's not a kind of hypnogogic stupefaction a worthy aim for a writer to cast over his readers. It might be you know, it very well might be. for guidance on the matter I turned as ever to Dobson the 20th century's Titanic out of print pamphleteer in his pamphlet, stringing a few words together to no apparent purpose out of print. He has this to say. stringing a few words together to no apparent purpose. To the possible stupefaction of one's readers is a worthy aim. blunt screw flak karma to pin cushion roset smelly little penguins. See, it can work wonders. Now I'm going to take a nap.

Frank Key  23:02
Don't worry, if you're paying attention, you'll realize I was quoting from Dobson there. Dobson who is going to take a nap, not me. I wouldn't take a nap in the middle of a show if I couldn't stay awake. And one way of staying awake is to read something exciting. So here is an exciting story. It was a dark and stormy night. I wrapped myself in my cloak and took my dagger. And I crept through the dark insalubrious alleyways until I came to a doorway. I pushed it open and entered a room full of smoke and mirrors through a glass darkly. I hatched a plot it was Oh, hang on. Yeah, little little problem there, but it's resolved itself. So I hatched a plot. It was a complicated secret and fiendish plot. And if it succeeded, crowned heads would topple. If, on the other hand, it did not succeed, and I was caught in flat grantee, then the only head likely to topple would be my own. I was fond of my head, like Neville Chamberlain's. It was oddly shaped. But it was my head, the only head I would ever have. I was keen for it not to be toppled. And so I went over and over and over the details of my plot, with my co conspirators in the room full of smoke and mirrors. We tested the plot for floors. Whichever way we looked at it, it seemed sound, it could perhaps have been slightly more dastardly than was the case. And that would have been a boon But we did not wish to unleash the hounds of uncertainty. I had been pursued and attacked by these hounds in the past and had been lucky to escape with my head. It was Lloyd George I think, who said Chamberlain's head was odd, though now I checked my sources I see he said it was a wrong shaped head. Mine I would say is odd, but not wrong. It's a standard human head shape, more or less. seen through a glass darkly. However, my head becomes distorted as things will do when seen through dark glass in a room full of smoke and mirrors. I try not to let this upset me, reminding myself that it's merely a visual trick. And the real head, the solid one perched on my neck is not so distorted. All by albeit it's a trifle odd. And I have to say that in comparison to the heads of some of my co conspirators, my head is well proportioned and nearly flawless. The plot though now that is absolutely flawless, where you have plotted and plotted and plotted and we cannot spot a single flaw in it. At dawn, we will lie in wait for the prints behind a splurge of shrubbery as his carriage policies, we will leap out in our cloaks and plant john daggers Indeed, those are the bare bones of the plot. From what I can gather from its depiction from its depiction on postage stamps. The princes head is neither old nor wrong shaped. It is a pretty average princely type of head, though wet behind the ears. Dawn then, will bring not just a new day, but a new era of world shuttering revolution.

Frank Key  27:15
Note, the narrator of the above piece failed to spot the obvious flaw in his plot. The prince had an extensive network of spies ever on the lookout for bands of near do wells wrapped in cloaks and wielding daggers meeting in rooms full of smoke and mirrors in dark in salubrious alleyways that the near do wells all had odd and wrong shaped heads made them all the more conspicuous. They were arrested shortly before dawn, and holed into berliet where they languish still forced to like postage stamps, showing the beauteous gorgeous head of the prince.

Frank Key  28:27
And I'm afraid that's all we have time for on hooting yard this week. I did have another story for you Called the village wrestler, which is about a wrestler in a village. But there's no time to read that Now, given the time. So that will that will be something for you to look forward to next week. As I say Don't forget to go and visit the hooting odd website. look at a picture of a man surrounded by dangling leaks, and many, many other things. And Yep, I think that's about it. So bye bye.
