Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. It's a very special day to day. It's evening of lagu breus music and lopsided prose Eve, when tiny throughout the land, gathering fields and gardens and on hillsides and set bonfires and dance round in a circle screeching and wailing, or I may have I don't actually I may have got that mixed up with something else. Another feast it is though the eve of an evening of lagu breus music and lopsided prose, which could also be called hooting yard alive for one night only. Very rarely, I will be doing a live performance, accompanied by as a Spaceman singing songs playing the ukulele at Wolfson and Taipei bookshop gallery cafe at 12 Bermondsey square, tickets are still available, they cost five pounds. It starts at 7pm. So that's tomorrow, and I do recommend that everyone, wherever you are, is there will turn up and I hope some other people do too. If you're listening to this on the podcast, of course, that'll happen months ago, so you can forget everything I've just said. But those of you listening, live, drop everything you're doing, and get yourselves to Bermondsey square, Wolf and and Tay tomorrow evening at seven. Anyway, here at hooting yard, we're regularly inundated with queries relating to eggs. Here, for example, is a plaintive plea from listener. Tim thurn. Question. When you are dining with an intimate friend, and an omelet or room is served. What do you do? My spies tell me that Tim has copied out this question from a book by Max Oh REL published in 1903. And charmingly entitled rambles in woman land. And in the book, the answer to the question is given that without any ceremony, you take a spoon and taking the burning liquid, you pour it over the dish gently and unceasingly. If you are careless, and fail to keep the pink and blue flame alive, it goes out at once, and you have to eat instead of a delicacy, a dish fit only for people who like or are used to have their palates scraped by rough food. If you would be sure to be successful, you will ask your friend to help you watch the flame and you will even ask him to lift the omelet gently so that the room may be poured all over it until the whole of the alcohol contained in the liquor is burned out. Aren't to which I would only add that taking a spoon without any ceremony is easier said than done. But my remarks on that we'll have to wait for our series on spoons and ceremonies, which is forthcoming.

Frank Key  03:57
Continuing on a food theme. When you're planning a bowtie picnic, the very first thing you need to do before deciding upon the menu, which is our chief preoccupation today is to check what the forecast says about the conditions of the weather and the sea. If for example, you find out that it will be choppy with squalls, then you would do best to avoid a dish such as clotted Pollack, dad's suitably fishy, but too rich to creamy and in the event potentially nausea eating something plainer like boiled sweets in gravy would be better for your picnic. provided of course, that the gravy is not to gain me. Rank gravies should be avoided at all times, but especially when out in a boat picnicking on the high seas. Some might say that any gravy even the plainest even with boiled sweets swimming in it is an answer. Suitable item for a picnic menu. What would the suppose need for bowls and spoons and beds, but I say it can be pulled into beakers with sealed lids and glugged they're from with no bowl or spoon in sight. You will probably still want beds, but they're essential for any maritime feast. What we've always sloshing about of the boat upon the waters. And believe you me, boats will slosh about even on the calmest waters. That's just how it is. greasy and slippery foods also be avoided when packing the hamper before boarding the boat sink rather of taking hard, chewy and even stale items. A bowtie picnic can be a splendid way of using up leftovers for what proves unpalatable can be chucked overboard into the sea, where it will be devoured by the many ravenous scavenging befindet and be flippant beings that cavort within the waters often just below the surface with great snapping drawers. But there would be no point picnicking at all if you threw the entire contents of the hamper into the broiling ocean. So do be sure to pack some real treats like New South Wales mozzie pan cane toads and rolie polie pudding and processed trees triangles, and the devils water biscuits, better known these days as cream crackers. Just make sure that the ores of your boat are real and wooden and not made of compacted hundreds and thousands stiffened with corn flour paste. There do well key side boats for highest camps have been known to play such tricks on land lovers. Be warned.

It was remembering Sunday on on Sunday. just gone. And to to mark the occasion. Channel five showed the greatest scape. The john Sturges film from 1963. I watched it for the first time in many years. And I was struck by a scene about an hour into the film. It's a very long film for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I was struck by a scene about an hour in which for me fatally undermined the plot. Up to that point we're rooting for the Allied prisoners of war who, as is usual in such dramas, say things like okay traps, let's form an escape committee and smoke our pipes. And we accept their statements that it's their duty to try to escape into Otherwise Otherwise make life as difficult as possible for their Bosh captors. But then, comes the scene where blys played by Donald Pleasance gives an ornithology lecture to some of the men. He whistles the song of the warbler and then shows the men how to draw the masked Shrike. And we're asked to believe that sensible British chaps would rather risk gruesome death at the hands of the Gestapo when they could see out the war having birdlife explained to them by eerie eyed Donald Pleasance. I'm sorry, but this seems to me utterly implausible. And for all the thrills and spills of the remaining two hours, I think the film would have been much better had it concentrated solely on blinds ornithology classes.

Frank Key  09:34
The first two items were linked on this week's show were linked by food. And very cleverly, the next two items are linked by ornithology because the next piece involves birds or a bird. Notice how our segues from one thing to another So, so smoothly, many, many hours of planning go into this, you know, There is a common phrase often used when one wishes to disparage someone as a timid milk SOP. We all come across timid milk SOPs from time to time. And though in the spirit of Christian charity, we should not disparage them. We do. We do, possibly to make ourselves look Hardy and tough By comparison, even or especially when we're hardly Hardy and tough, but rather fearful and insecure. It's that very insecurity that can cause us to disparage another as a way of distracting attention from our own timidity and milk selfishness, which we otherwise try to disguise by means such as bumptious sness, and the glugging of huge flagons of beer. This is just elementary psychology. The common phrase I referred to, which we resort to is, he wouldn't say boo to a goose. I'm sure you've heard it many times at cocktail parties or in sporting arenas are not only have you heard it, in all likelihood, you've said it yourself more than once. Such a timid milk SOP is he or she were saying that they're to fret even to say boo to a goose? The inference is that hardy tough persons, among whom, of course, the speaker intended to be known as they are counted, would say boo to a goose, and think nothing of it. It's high time I think that we examine this assertion. JOHN cheevers 1950 one's short story. Good bye. My brother famously ends with the question. What can you do with a man like that? And I confess I asked myself that whenever I consider the thought of hardy tough Cove barging about in the vicinity of geese, and saying boo to them. For one thing, it's neither seemly nor dignified. And we should always strive to be both seemly and dignified. For on such foundations, our civilizations built and for another thing, it's a rather foolish act. For what do we expect the goose to do in return? Let us remind ourselves that whatever else it might be, a goose is a bird. And as such, it will treat with incomprehension, the doings of humankind. We are alien beings to them, as they are to us. look into the eyes of a goose or a swan or even a budgerigar and you will see a deep black well of fathomless in human Savitri. So, we might as well say, pencil, or Heraclitus, as boom, for all the difference it would make to the goose. What the goose will do is to honk to just its head forward, and to make pecking gestures with its beak. Whatever we say to it. This is how terrifying and we need to do is scamper off in the opposite direction, or keep a sturdy fence between us and the goose. In either case, we will remain unharmed, whether we're Hardy and tough, or indeed, timid and milk swordfish. And therein lies the point to suggest that somehow saying boom to a goose is evidence of hardihood and toughness is fundamentally misconceived. If we still wish to disparage someone as a timid milk SOP. And I hope I've demonstrated why we should not but I won't hold my breath, then we need surely to find a new phrase, one that will stand up to rigorous analysis and will probably not involve birds.

He was an expert in many subjects and intervened widely in others. Among his contributions to learn in journals were papers on meteorology, navigation, surveying, anthropology, archaeology, painting, photography, the use of spectacles by divers, ultrasonic whistles, diet fads, currency reform, visions, corporal punishment, the ideal length of rope for hanging people, the flashing of signals to Mars, and dozens of other topics. Almost as numerous while his inventions ranging from advanced scientific instrument to gadgets for personal convenience. At the age of 13, he designed a steam flying machine, followed by an hourglass a speedometer for bicycles, and in later life, a periscope for seeing over the heads of crowds. It was used for viewing processions, of which he was particularly fond, in conjunction with a wooden brick wrapped in cloth and tied to a string so that it could be lowered to the ground for standing on. Now I know what you're thinking, did Dobson and botsman spawn some kind of Love A Child, perhaps using a technique concocted by the latter, but no, apart from anything else that would be chronologically incoherent like a leech doctor with a brain scanner. The man described is in fact, Francis Galton, as described in eccentric lives and peculiar notions by the late john Michel book published in 1984. I should mention I have a personal interest here. JOHN Michel once fed me some cake one afternoon. Also that that cake eating event or occasion with john Michelle was Ed Baxter, the program director of resonance FM, you see how all these things fit together. I can't remember what kind of cake it was. Anyway, another thing that Michelle says about Francis Galton is this. He was strongly religious, but the only type of worship that appealed to him was the spontaneous variety he had seen among the Africans. He considered that their trance dances and fetish worship expressed the genuine religious spirit of the natural man. As usual, he put that belief to practical test. looking around for the least worshipful object he could find, he hit upon the comic finger of Mr. Punch, and forced his mind into believing that it possessed divine powers. The experiment succeeded, he came to experience a large share of the feelings, a barbarian entertains towards his idol. And for a long time, he was unable to look at Mr punches grotesque features, without a feeling of reverence.

Frank Key  18:47
That's quite a good idea. If you if you if you feel that you're godless thing to something, to worship as a God, and as Francis Galton did, force your mind to reverence it. And please send me details of what you choose to reverence and how your reverence gets on. And I'll share the more interesting stories here at hooting out, which does remind me of course, that I must some point tell you further details of the eerie cult of Krishnan guru Murthy, the channel for newsreader who has attracted around him an eerie cold, but that's for another time. When the Knights drawing in, it's time for parlor games. Whereas in the summer, you might spend your evenings going for long hikes before or after supper, roaming the hills and the malls. As autumn descend, you'll want to close the shutters and gather around a blazing fire pattern and the matter thumbnail Yes. And your bewildering number of times. And on Saturday evenings, even reading aloud lengthy passages from the Bible can pull. So you will want other resources and what could be better than not than a diverting parlor game. To play poop all lob, sometimes known as all lob or poop. All you need is that supply of cardboard and some string and some glue. One member of the family is designated as the Admiral. If you're upper class, the captain, if you're middle class, or the skipper, if you're working class. Everyone else leaves the parlor and gathers crammed in the pantry for an hour or so. The Admiral or Captain or Skipper uses this time and the cardboard and the string and the glue to transform the parlor into a nautically accurate poop all up deck. When the rest of the family returns from the pantry, each intern must use skill, judgment and knowledge of ship construction to declare whether the parlor is now a poop deck or an all up deck. Those who decide correctly are treated to a feast at the captain's table. That is they're each allowed to go back to the pantry and choose a snack from among the snack items on the pantry shelves. Those who decide incorrectly tossed into the sea. That is they must climb back out of the open window and wait shivering in the garden until the next round. The Admiral or Captain or Skipper, then dismantle the cardboard and string and glue pooper all up deck and returns the parlor to its pristine condition. The winners come back from the pantry stuffed with sausages or pies or fruit and the losers climb back in through the window and someone else is designated as the admiral or Captain or Skipper and the game begins again.

Frank Key  22:38
And we return to birds yet again with a quotation. This one is from nature notes by O'Byrne war, published in The Daily Telegraph on the 11th of August 1990. On May 13 1988, I was amused to read a report in the Daily Telegraph that the Royal Society for the Protection of birds had erected a mesh fence to keep bird fanciers away from a colony of little turns on Great Yarmouth beach, whose numbers had grown from 20 pairs to 70 pairs in three years. On August the second 1990 I was interested to read a report in the Daily Telegraph as follows Britain's biggest breeding colony of little turns on Great Yarmouth beach Norfolk, where 201 pairs were nesting has been largely wiped out by two hedgehogs and a Kestrel. kestrels, of course are fanatically protected by all the high tech and paramilitary resources of the multimillion pound Royal Society for the Protection of birds, which on this occasion seems to have been hoist with its own petard as they say. It's hard to know with whom we should sympathize most in this tale. The ordinary bird fanciers who were kept away from fancying little turns by a mesh fence put up by the superior bird fanciers of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds bureaucracy, or the unfortunate little turns condemned to Twitter away unseen. My own sympathies are with the hedgehogs. They're delightful if slightly flea ridden animals with whom it's sometimes possible to hold an intelligent conversation. Has anybody ever had an intelligent conversation with a little turn? hedgehogs do not demand a whole apparatus of repression to survive. Every time a hedgehog wipes out our little turn. It is a blow for freedom.

Another another quote, to end with, because I've run out of new hooting odd material, so I'm giving you some quotations. Possibly I've been saving things up for tomorrow. A final reminder not to miss the evening of a lopsided prose and goobers music, or the hooting yard live experience. Anyway, this is a from an 1852 book by William bottom done called Old roads and new roads. Nearly every Roman indeed had qualified himself before he was 50 to be a candidate for the travelers club. And sometimes, the fine gentleman, who declined, taking an active part in public affairs, found himself unexpectedly 1000 miles from home with an imperial rescript in his portmanteau in joining him, not to return to Rome without special leave. to such a compulsory journey was the poet Ovid condemned, apparently, for his very particular attentions to the princess Julia. his exile was a piece of ingenious cruelty. He was sent to Tomi, which was far beyond the range of all fashionable bathing places, the climate was atrocious. The neighborhood was worse, the wine was execrable, and was often hard, frozen and eaten like a lozenge. And his only society was that of the barracks, or a few rich but unpolished corn factors, who speculated in grain and deals on the shores of the UHC scene. To write verses from mourn to Jew Eve was the unfortunate poet's only solace. And he sent so many reams of allergies to Rome, that his friends came up last to vote him a bore. And he was reduced from one to fitting audience to learn the genetic language and read his lacrimosa caplets two circles of gaping barbarians.

Frank Key  27:53
And that's all we have time for this week. I hope I don't find myself reading lacrimosa couplets two circles of gaping barbarians at Wolfson unti tomorrow evening, but you never know it could happen. That's it then for this week, go to the hooting yard website. Have a read of what you find there, buy some books, or even donate some money. If you're listening to the podcast. Send lots of money. I don't know why I think that but I do. You'll find a PayPal donation button use it because you get all this stuff for free otherwise. Yeah, that's it. Bye bye. back next week.
