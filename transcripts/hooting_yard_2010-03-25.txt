Good evening, this is hooting out on the air with me Frank key and I'm going to read few for about half an hour. I understand there have been various technical problems, that resonance today Well, now, there's a human problem in the UK actually, almost, but not quite ready to do the show. I won't go into the details, but my worst nightmare has come to pass it, which is that I find myself I had planned occasionally to wing it, and see if I could babble for half an hour without a script. And I thought the time might have come to do that. But I think we're I think I'm almost ready to begin the show. So let's have another little blast of the Caucasian lullaby and then I'll start reading to you.

Is it not curious the manner in which the most disparate things into connect the way in which we find linkages some flimsy some as sturdy as iron chains, between persons and places and objects and events? If Mr. Raven, the club footed inquiry agent in the strange affair of Adelaide Harris by Leon Garfield, one of Mr. Keys favorite books, could continue devising his spider diagram beyond the bounds of that book plot. Would he not eventually encompass the whole world within its web of foul intrigue? These idle thoughts bubbling gently in my brain while I stared out the window hoping to see a Heron or a cow. We're prompted by the recollection that Ivan clank, the bailiff who's Grizzly dummies was mentioned in passing and a piece I read some weeks ago called variation on a theme of Scott Walker was albeit briefly, a member of the pointy town chapter of the Tuesday Weld fan club. He had left or rather been booted out before the picnic excursion I described in another piece. In fact, if the membership records are to be believed, and why should they not be Ivan Clank time in the club lasted but 20 minutes for 25 on the afternoon of a gorgeous summer's day, he paid his sub signed his name in the ledger and received his badge and card and list of rules and regulations and passport sized photograph of Tuesday Weld and a celebrator a slice of Flan a note appended at 445 on the same afternoon declares that Ivan Clank membership number 835 Bailiff has left or rather been booted out of the club, no explanation is given. The handwriting appears to be that of the secretary Mr. fab. In itself, this would be of miniscule interest. But Hark. What is that we here? It is the pencil of the pamphleteer Dobson scratching across a page of one of his writing tablets. In a further interconnection to warm the cold cold heart of Mr. Raven. We learned that Dobson actually wrote a pamphlet about Ivan Clank and his fugitive Tuesday, weld fanclub related activities. The pamphleteer seems first become aware of Ivan Clank when he read an account of the bailiff's gruesome destruction at the hands of brigand in the daily Bailiff and brigand Herald. He liked to keep up to speed with these things did Dobson the papers legendary recommend the story the papers legendary recommendations for further reading for those whose Curiosity has been piqued column pointed the pamphleteer in several directions, most of which he failed to follow up. But he did learn somehow about Ivan clanks membership of the Tuesday Weld fan club and its abrupt termination. And he even seems to have gained access to the membership records. Which is a wonder all things considered what would one thing and another from whichever angle you look at it all in all Sham Beco Sham Beco heartland toe. The resulting pamphlet is not one of Dobson's best. Ivan clank, the bailiff Oh is he dead? Then? is a curdled and bickering text unleavened by any of the pamphleteers usual majestic sweeping paragraphs. it purports to be a potted biography of the bailiff in which the Tuesday Weld fanclub hoo ha is seen as pivotal, but Dobson does not say it is what that it purports to be a potted biography of the bailiff in which the Tuesday Weld fan club who heart is seen as pivotal, but Dobson does not say what it is that pivots upon it. Instead, he launches into a character assassination of Mr. thurb, a man he had never met, and of whom he knew not a jot. It was lucky for Dobson that he was not prosecuted for libel, though that would have been an unlikely outcome. Given that the pamphlet sold just two copies, both to buyers overseas with more money than sense. It's a sad reflection upon the state of pamphleteering or possibly just a Dobson's pamphleteering that it was his best seller that year.

Call me puff. I live in a cave by the sea, the very same sea where I have sailed in the Pequod. As it happens, I am a dragon, and not just any dragon, but a magic dragon. So put that in your pipe and smoke it. For many long years, I used to entertain paper children with my conjuring tricks accompanied by my lovely assistant, Winifred? Well, I say lovely, but in truth when a thread was a bit frumpy for a magician's assistant, she had a pronounced stoop and a runny eye. However, she was game for anything, including being sawn in half or plunged into a cauldron of boiling tar, or appearing to be of course, and there are very few magicians assistants, willing to live in a damp dark cave by the sea with only a dragon for company, albeit a magic one. Williford was also absolutely indispensable and enticing the paper children from the various seaside villages they're about to our magic shows. Had I leaped into the square snorting fire and thumping my great scaly tail upon the ground, the paper children would have run screaming, and their paper parents would have battled them indoors and bolted and shattered their hovels, the hovels to were of paper, so I could simply have set them ablaze with a couple of fiery belt trees. But I am civic minded as well as magical. And in any case, laying waste to the land has never appealed to me on aesthetic grounds as much as anything. I much prefer to frolic in the autumn mist. The Magic shows which we held either outside the cave or in cow strewn fields between the villages. What always a great success. My Presta digital skills are second to none, though I say so myself, and certainly the envy of the magic dragon community. It took a long years of practice manipulating my fearsome great talents to shuffle a deck of cards, so that it was in perfect order, both numerically and alphabetically, aced King clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. I killed or wounded countless doves and rabbits before I learned to handle them with utmost delicacy. That was before Winifred joined me and I had to fight off attacks by vengeful doves and rabbits. Single Claud. Later, on the very rare occasions when I was set upon by the great great great grandchild of a dead or maimed davon rabbit, Winifred smashed it on their head with her spade and shoved it into her cooking pot. This was the same part I would Chuck her into. under the illusion it was brim full of boiling tar, a trick which always elicited gasps and nausea from the paper children Ah, those were heady times. Last winter for it and I eventually had a falling out. It was my fault. I felt in need of a holiday and hired a boat with a billowing sail, planning a sightseeing voyage to take in the crumbling coastal castles of kings and princes who had been exiled following the revolution. I knew the sea was riddled with pirates. And it was for that reason I chose us ship made a paper kiled instead of winnifred. Far better, I reasoned that in the event of a pirate attack, I could sacrifice a child made of paper and flimsy tissue paper at that, then risk my lovely frumpy assistant coming to harm. She didn't see it like that, insisting she was no shrinking violet and would give any piratical way you layer the same treatment she meted out to doves and rabbits. But I was stubborn in that characteristic way of dragons, magical or not. And on a misty autumn morning, the paper child and I set sail, leaving Winifred seething with rage on the shore glugging from a bottle of dubs blood. I did not expect in the long months of our voyage that every single pirate ship we encountered and there were many would lower its skull and crossbones flag at our approach. Even the most ruthless pirate it seemed, became a quaking, knocked need jelly at the sight of me, roaring my name and snorting fire.

When I grew tired of having kings and princes bowing to me from their dilapidated castle ramparts, we set sail for home. When a friend had up sticks and gone, I knew not where, and at the very moment we docked a sharp gust of wind blew my ship, make paper child away, away, he was swept away and gone. I was alone. Never again, would I frolic in the autumn mist along the Cherry Lane. I retired to my cave, where I slouch in the gloom, shuffling cards to pass the time surrounded by the bones of doves and rabbits, and memories of happier days.

I'm told that there's a song by someone called Puff the Magic Dragon, about the same character. And that there's some theory that because this song was written in the 60s, it's got some kind of hidden drug or not very hidden drug reference. I would like to make it quite plain to listeners, that the people who wrote the song denied that there was any drug reference in their song. As I deny there's any drug reference in the pros piece, which may or may not predate Puff the Magic Dragon, the song. It said that the cartographer Pamela land became interested in patterns of pressed meat consumption around the world. She traveled from continent to continent, collecting statistics, and even attending tastings, when and where such were held in barns or conference centers. As soon as she had filled a notebook, she shoved it into one of the pre addressed Jiffy bags she brought with her, visited the local office of the Postal Service and sent the book back home where it and all its fellows would be waiting for her when her globe trotting survey was complete. Her assistant a sycophantic wannabe cartographer, had the keys to Dr. lamps house and kept an eye out for the posty and whenever a jiffy bag was delivered, she locked herself in and took the newly arrived notebook from his bag and arranged it with all the other notebooks on a pedestal notebook stand with attached cartographical worksurface, a Formica countertop with the design of ruled squares. So when Pamela lampe came home, everything was ready for her and she set to work making a world Atlas of pressed meat. She let the assistant to help her out, but did not allow her to do anything of great importance. For her. She did not wish the assistant to have any pretext to wangle and acknowledgement in the text. So the assistant lit Dr. lamps, cigarettes and made cups of tea. Coco for her and swept the floor with a broom like Cinderella, but did not make any direct contribution to the Atlas. When it was eventually published, the reasoning behind the entire escapade became apparent for ever since she was a child, Dr. lampe had been determined to create single handedly a book which she could with absolute justification call Pam's spam maps.

Last week, I read a couple of stories about Alger Hiss and Whittaker chambers, and some of the text of one of the stories was taken from discourses on the Christian revelation viewed in connection with the modern astronomy by Thomas Chalmers, written in 1817. I've been reading a bit more of charmers, and I have to say he is a master of blathering nonsense, wrapped in majestic prose. So here's some more of him nearly 200 years old, this text. What we have now to remark is that the infidel, who urges the astronomical objection to the truth of Christianity is only looking with half an eye to the principle on which it rests, carry out the principle and the objection vanishes. He looks abroad on the immensity of space, and tells us how impossible it is that this narrow corner of it can be so distinguished by the attentions of the deity. Why does he not also look abroad on the magnificence of eternity, and perceive how the whole period of these peculiar attentions have a hole time which elapses between the fall of man and the consummation of the scheme of his recovery is but the twinkling of a moment to the mighty role of innumerable ages. The whole interval between the time of Jesus Christ leaving his father's abode to sojourn amongst us, so that time when he shall have put all his enemies under his feet, and deliver that the kingdom to God, even his father, that God may be all in all, the whole of this interval, there's a smaller proportion to the whole of the Almighty's reign, as this solitary world does to the universe around it, and an infinitely smaller proportion than any time, however short which an earthly monarch spends on some enterprise of private benevolence, does to the whole Walk of his public and recorded history. Why then does not the man who can shoot his conception so sublimely abroad over the field of an immensity that knows no limits? Why does he not also shoot them forward through the VISTA of a succession that ever flows without stop, and without termination, he has stepped across the confines of this world's habitation in space. And out of the field, which lies on the other side of it has he gathered an argument against the truth of Revelation, we feel that we have nothing to do, but to step across the confines of this world history in time, and out of the futurity, which lies beyond it, we can gather that which will blow the argument to pieces, or stamp upon it all the narrowness of a partial and mistaken calculation. The day is coming, when the whole of this wondrous history shall be looked back upon by the eye of remembrance, and be regarded as one incident in the extended annals of creation. And with all the illustration and all the glory has thrown on the character of the Deity, will it be seen as a single step in the evolution of his designs, and long as the time may appear, from the first act of our redemption to its final accomplishment, and close and exclusive glue sieve, as we may think the attentions of God upon it, it will be found that it has left him room enough for all his concerns, and that on the high scale of eternity, it is but one of those passing and ephemeral transactions, which crowd is the history of a never ending administration.

I'm sure we'll agree. I should remember to mention here. I have been mentioning on a couple of recent programs that you can of course, donate to hooting yard, go to the website, and you'll find a pay pal thing to donate money to hooting yard. But let's not forget that you can also and should also donate directly to resonance to keep this program and many other programs going. So please go to the resonance website and hit the PayPal button there and donate to resonance. And there'll be a, there's the upcoming fundraiser, starting on the first of May. And I can tell you now as a great surprise, that among the items to be auctioned, from the first of May, in the resonance fundraiser are copies of Derrick the dust particle and bring me the head of Derrick color dust particle, historic illustrated stories by Perry Natal, with illustrations by me out of print for many, many years, and these are two original copies, one of each one of each of the books, we never did manage to complete the third volume in the series, which was to be called the bitter tears of Derrick, the dust particle. But anyway, those of you with lots of money and lots of sense, will be able to bid in an auction for those two main magnificent items from the first of May, and all the money will go to resonance so it will be money well spent. That's TAs and spring there appeared in the town a man surpassing grubby. The sheer filthiness of human body and soul caused untold jitters in the towns folk. tongues wagged in taverns, and they did more than wag. There was spitting and cursing and imprecation. Until hotheads were quieted by the sending of a citizens delegation to the good burgers of the town. These burgers were good and they were elderly, and had terrific beards, and some were blind or losing their sight. But this betokened for the town's folk great wisdom on account of law under legend. A hammer thump thrice upon a panel indicated the good burgers had made a decision and the town's folk gathered in the square to hear it pronounced. The grubby man was to be coaxed into a tub of hot water and scrubbed with soapy brushes scrubbed and rinsed and scrubbed and rinsed until all crate of visible filth was expunged. And he would step from the tub to being wrapped in a large rectangular towel be no white, while the water in the tub was poured down a drain into the sewer. And so it came to pass. But voices were raised in taverns and on street corners in in civic hubs of social cohesion. The visible filth still lurks below in the sewer, bubbling and frothing and ready at any time to burst up through the piping. And also also never forget, there was the Grubbiness of the grubby man's soul, invisible yet the more potent for that a second citizens delegation, a second thumping of the hammer, a second gathering in the market square. This time, the good burgers made two determinations to meet the two concerns of the townsfolk. First, that each day forever, the sewers would be scrubbed and rinsed with brushes on hot water and carbolic soap scrubbed and rinsed from end to end by volunteers. Second, that the grubby man would endure a course of moral instruction, and his soul examined daily for hours and hours under duress, until every fleck of turpitude was obliterated in the pitiless light of blocks minister of lovely thought. And so it came to pass

and hard as it may be to hold in your head, that man surpassing grubby became, oh after many a year of instruction and examination, a pillar of the community never quite a good burger yet. One who said advice was sought by townsfolk young and old, on such matters as dogs and cats and postal deliveries and running track maintenance and lamp post height and Belisha beacon brightness, and the fish market and soup recipes and ballet troupe recruitment and gust of wind and air temperature and flocks of sweeping scavenger birds and bus stop furniture and mountaineering equipment and oil waste, and Japanese fog monitoring systems and duck calls and the vanity of human wishes and snow flurries and the ranking of autumn leaves and pig feeding and the brains of lobsters and the Flemish primitives and mulching garden plots and filth and muck and untold Grubbiness. For scrub and rinses they might, the volunteers never quite managed to eradicate the visible filth from the sewer. And on the seventh day, petals fell in Petaluma.

Very briefly to end the show four quotations from an account of the case of Mary bland be given in Tales of the new gate calendar by Raina happens to 1981 for separate, brief quotations. I am sorry, there are such occasions to clean your pebbles. You must make use of the powder to them by putting it in anything of substance wherein it will not swim the top of the water. The father feeling unwell frequently to watergirl this was a proper vehicle for the powder. On Sunday morning, I again examined Mr. blandy he seemed much relieved, but on viewing his fundament, I found it almost surrounded with ugly t x creations and ounces. I always thought there was mischeif in those cursed scotch pebbles.

So that's the end of this week's hooting Yod I do hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to contribute to resonance. Don't forget to contribute to hooting yard. And don't forget to listen again next week when there'll be more of the same old guff. Bye bye
