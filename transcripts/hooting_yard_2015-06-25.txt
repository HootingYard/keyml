Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com My name is Frankie and this is my nunhead stuff. Oh no, hang on. Sorry. That's Louise shaffers program. This is hooting out on the air. I just got confused for a moment there and and what should they know of potatoes who only potatoes No, asked Dobson in the title in the title of one of his pamphlets, which is sadly out of print. It's a dazzling tour de force noted for containing an eerily accurate description of crinkle cut oven trips written before such things existed. It is worth noting that the dazzling nature of the pamphlet is less to do with the quality of Dobson's prose, which might better be described in this instance as hysterical and incoherent and more to do with the then fashionable far out groovy psychedelic typeface, employed by marigold crew when setting the text. Indeed, so dazzling is the appearance of the multi coloured swirly maelstrom of type that one is advised to wear sunglasses when reading it, or attempting to read it. Peter Hitchens has claimed not without reason that marigold qu was probably high on pot when producing the pamphlet, but she also may have thought that it's far out groovy psychedelic look would increase sales in headshops and free festivals and other such exocraft senses of the era. If so, she was horribly mistaken for the potato pamphlet, as it's commonly known, sold only half a dozen copies in toto. And three of those went to a wandering proto crusty, who pitched his tent in Dobson's back garden for the duration of the Summer Love. The pamphleteer himself might also have been high on pot when he wrote the text. For as I said, his prose is hysterical and incoherent. A weedy wannabe Dobson list would have tossed the pamphlet aside, or even set it on fire. But I'm at a Manta and in my devotion to the great man, so I enrolled in a special study group. each weekday evening for three whole years, we met in an abandoned pavilion to pour over the pamphlet eight of us, trying as best we could to make some sense from it. What follows their nose as much to the contributions of Messrs clapper shrub black in spirit squelch Dale Winton, Boggess and glob as to my own insight. Dalton seems to have conceived of the idea of the crinkle cut oven chip, as the name Plus Ultra of space age food. This he says describing then imaginary frozen sliver of reconstituted potato based mush shaped with some sort of wiggly shaped jigsaw slicer will be the staple foodstuff of space travelers and arrow naught, and cosmonauts, as they venture sort of galaxies yet are known. He asked if any alien beings they might need would comprehend that the crinkle cut oven chip and the ordinary potato, a tuberous vegetable buried in soil back on planet Earth. Were in any way related to each other? And he answers no to that question. No matter he said how advanced and super intelligent the beings were, they would never be able to grasp the human ingenuity that turned the one into the other. Dobson then posits the idea that it is the potato that has evolved from the crinkled cut oven clip rather than vice versa. In a prescient passage written some years before Stanley Kubrick's film 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968. he invents a scene where a primitive ape picks up a crinkle cut oven grip and tosses it into the air where it is suddenly transformed into a potato.

Frank Key  05:23
annoyingly Dobson does not specify the variety of potato, or perhaps he does. And we were simply incapable of deciphering a particularly far out groovy psychedelic section of the text. Quite what point he's trying to make with this topsy turvy, 12 is unclear. Even when one is high on pot. I speak not of my own experience, but that has messaged squelch and glob who often huddled together in the corner of the abandoned pavilion before our study group meetings, indulging in what I think in some circles is known as reefer madness. For all that, and what should they know potatoes who only potatoes know, is a fascinating Curio. Dobson does actually answer the question posed in the title. But in doing so, he raises a blizzard of further questions, the answers to which perhaps will not become apparent until the true space age is upon us.

I received a letter from toward grip. I wonder if this was the same toward grip who is something of a luminary in the world of football coaching, but apparently is a different toward grip all together. Anyway, here's what he has to say for himself. Dear Mr. Key, I have been a devoted reader of yours for many years. Something that has particularly struck me is your fondness for the motif of a character, quote, as a swish sophisticated cocktail party leaning insouciantly against a mantle piece, unquote. You return to this again and again. Sometimes the person so leaning is a fictional character. And sometimes in first person narratives, it is you I am not so naive as to think that the I figure in such tales is actually you, and that the pieces are wholly autobiographical. I realized that the first person narrator may be a fictional or semi fictional version of yourself. This interpretation is not simply common sense. But it's borne out by Roland Claire in his introduction to the anthology by aerostat to hooting yard, where he makes the point that when key conducts occasional epistolary dialogues with correspondence, almost certainly not real people, his engagement with them shades his own status, with a fictional quality is uncertain standing is compounded by the pieces written in the first person. And he posits a distinction between Frank key author of the blog versus Mr. Key, the quasar fictional entity. So when you report that you were at a Swish, sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a mantle piece, are we to infer that this statement is factual or fictional? Or are we deliberately left on shaky ground? uncertain, bewitched, bothered and bewildered? Incidentally, the question about from Mr. Clair also calls into question my own existence as one of your correspondence. While I know in the very core of my being, that I am a real person of flesh and blood, I need only bash my head against my writing desk to confirm as mark out, your readers may like Mr. Clair think I am almost certainly not real. whether or not their suspicions will be heightened or dampened by the coincidence that I share my name with one of the tip top figures in the world of football coaching. I cannot say in my part of the world toward grip is not so outlandish or name that one can jump to any conclusion In the matter, I think it best to pass over any further ruminations on the question of reality. Otherwise, we'd be here all day, and in all likelihood, end up with what my clinician has dubbed crumbling of the brain pans. Instead, I should like to turn to the reason I'm writing to you in the first place. It so happens that one of my hobbies alongside knitting sandpaper in rough surfaces and bird observation is enacting short extract from my favorite writers. To this end, I have in recent weeks, gone about wearing a little ether hood, Emily Dickinson taken pictures of drap girls in synthesis, David Bowie, sucked innumerable pebbles, Samuel Beckett, and run screaming from a Paris hotel room after casting a spell to summon the great god Pan. Alistair Crowley having tick these off in my ledger. Next on my list was to go to a swish sophisticated cocktail party and lean insouciantly against the mantle piece, Frank K. First of all, of course, I had to obtain an invitation to such a soiree. The difficulty with this was that like you, I've been described as a dialog, uneasy and recluse and I don't get out much. Oh, wait a minute. That reminds me. If you're as reclusive as Chris Cutler assert when he called you a dialog, uneasy and recluse, how is it that you're forever attending swished sophisticated cocktail parties?

Frank Key  11:45
I have spent an inordinate amount of time pondering this conundrum. Even if we take into account that many of the insouciance leaners are explicitly fictional characters, and can say that part j Roland Claire, you yourself are Quasar fictional, there remains the fact that there is something compelling in the scenes that convinces the reader, they must, at the very least, be the result of particularly acute authorial observation. Consider the swish and sophisticated nature of the cocktail parties, the insouciance of the person leaning, the brute solidity of the mantle piece itself. It seems unlikely that such details could be fomented entirely within your head. Absent of direct and emotionally shattering experience. I'm pleased to say that the results of my agonized mulling over the matter was ultimately beneficial. If Mr. Key as a recluse can yet summon the nerve to accept invitations to swish sophisticated cocktail parties, I said to myself, then I too, can screw my courage to the sticking place, and do likewise. I said this to myself repeatedly gazing into a mirror at my strange unnatural beauty. Eventually, I was ready. But still, I had not received any invitations. I dabbled with the idea of skipping to the next item on my list to ring upon the rain of a wind blowing wing in my ecstasy, carrot Manley Hopkins, but on the methodical sort of person, and I knew I would lie awake at night, remonstrating with myself, until I had completed the Frank key element of my project. I have been very careful when drawing up my roster to place my proposed enactments in a very specific order, based upon the blockman system, yellow notebook fifth series, though I was keenly aware of the possibility that blockman and his system and his notebooks in their series, were all fictional, having been made up by you, Mr. Key, I have found his guidance invaluable in several different areas of my life, not least the careful compiling of list in very specific orders. I've asked found myself at an impasse I could not move on until I had leaned in sushi in the against the mantle piece at a swished sophisticated cocktail party. And I could not attend the swish sophisticated cocktail party without an invitation. Or could I? Was it not possible for me simply to gatecrash such a do? Hell, yes, as Ed Miliband would say, But first, I had to find a party to gatecrash marches it went against my reclusive nature. I talked to walking the streets of an evening stopping when I came upon a Building with a window alive with light and pairing in to see if a switch sophisticated cocktail party was in progress. I'd already planned how I would gain entry. knocking at the door, I would pretend to be an emergency postman with an urgent delivery for at which point I would counterfeit a violent coughing fit and bite on a capsule of blood tucked in my Creek. Spraying what was in reality, a small amount of ducks blood all over the hallway carpet, I would stagger into the house and collapse. While the host ran for help. I would stand up, dab at my mouth with a napkin to erase any traces of Gore, comb my hair, take off my emergency postman's jacket and stuff it behind the umbrella stand. Then sashay into the main room where the main party was in full swing, grab a cocktail from a trade and make for the mantlepiece. against which I would lean insouciantly job done.

Frank Key  16:06
I don't know if you've ever stalked the evening streets in search of a switch sophisticated cocktail party to invite all your way into by dint of a foolproof scheme, but believe you may it's not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps I was stalking through the wrong part of town down by the docks where the sailors all meat, eating fish heads and tails, splitting the night with the roar of their jokes, laughing and lusting till the rancid sound of the accordion burst. The windows I peered into frame scenes of unimaginable depravity and debauch. Nor did I spotted mantlepiece clean enough to lean upon in my specially hired ferdinando boffo dinner suit worn beneath the emergency postman's jacket. I turned down an alley towards what I hoped would be a more salubrious part of town. When I became aware of footsteps following me, there was something inexplicably menacing about them. Mr. James Sheridan le fanu e. f. Benson, named last night absent from my list. I clicked into my pace, and so did the footstep, determined to confront whoever whatever was following me. I turned around. to my horror I saw silhouetted against the sickly moon, the lumbering walrus moustached psychopathic serial killer babinski My mind was a chaos. I had always believed him to be a purely fictional maniac dream that by you, Mr. Key to trouble my dreams. Yet here he was all too real, lumbering relentlessly towards me. As he raised his blood drenched axe above his head, preparing to strike. intermingled with my terror, I felt a small measure of solace, that, though it was not the enactment of a hooting yard scene I had planned when I drew my last breath, having been felled by babinski, I would inadvertently be recreating a common motif from the works of Mr. Key. That can be no more pecan farewell to this life. Be it a real life or perhaps, perhaps, an entirely fictional one.

Frank Key  19:12
I've got another letter The day after that one. Dear Mr. Key, wrote Olivia funnel, who may or may not be fictional, I wouldn't presume to know. I confess I'm a little puzzled by something. Yesterday, you reproduce the letter received from toward grip, which you say plops onto the mat, such as sorry, suggesting that it was an old fashioned letter written on paper and inserted into an envelope with a postage stamp affixed. Surely in our brave new world of digital fantasticness your correspondents communicate with you by email. perplexingly yours, Olivia funnel Well Miss phenyl It is true that almost all of my correspondence these days arrives in the form of electronic communications. However, as you will learn when next you check your inbox, all emails are received, generate an automated reply, which reads as follows. Thank you for writing to Mr. Key. Please note that your in script to cursors electronically will be ignored unless you rewrite it by hand with a propelling pencil upon a sheet of creamy paper, which you should then insert into an envelope to which you should have fixed a postage stamp. The envelope should then be rolled into a cylinder and fastened around the leg of a crow. whisper to Mr. K to Mr. K, into the crows ear and watch it fly away. If you're not sure where the crows ear is, study on ethology the fact that I'm replying to Olivia funnel is evidence that she did indeed follow these instructions. I want to point out that I do not as true modern electronic communication methods due to some ill tempered Luddite animus against the modern world, though I do, but rather because it pleases me to have crows flying in through my window on a regular basis. Once I've detached the rolled up envelope from the crows leg, I inject it with a serum which renders it unconscious and add it to my collection of unconscious crows. I've not yet worked out what to do with them all. And for the moment I'm content enough to see their number growing by the day. One of my correspondents suggested attaching a brain scanner to each CRO and deducing from the resulting printout, the nature of crows dreams and nightmares. This would seem to me a very worthy enterprise and I will consider giving it a go do Mr. Key rights Olivia funnel again, thank you for your reply to my query. Unfortunately, it raises further questions, which leads me even more perplexed than here to four. If you receive your letters through the agency of a CRO flying in through your window with an envelope fold around its leg How then did toward grip letter plop onto the mat. The only explanation that makes sense is that you drop the envelope onto the Mac yourself once you detached it from the CRO and before or after injecting the CRO with a serum. But what possible rationale could you have for so dropping the envelope? That seems to me to be the utmost foolery. Yours more in sorrow than in anger. Alivia funnel. I said after receiving Miss funnels earlier Miss is that I was unsure whether she was real or fictional. Evidence has now come to light, though she is decisively the latter. This leads me to conclude that contrary to her assertion, the utmost foolery would be to indulge a letter from a wholly fictitious person with a reply. I have instead torn both her letters to shreds with my bare hands. I intend to stuff the shreds into an envelope of cloth, thus forming a little cushion which will serve as a splendid resting place from one of my unconscious crows.

it's nearly the end of the show, but there's just time for me to inform you that pansy cradled. You recently spent three days in rural Denmark, and Upon her return, she presented me with some small gifts of Danish stationery. Among these was a pencil along the barrel of which the following phrases are stamped. grabs Agha knack, picky Poff auto Moloch t tat Tito clocks googa Naga flip now I am reliably informed that not one of those three phrases is actually Danish, nor is it English. And so if anyone can help with translating it from whatever language it's in, as I say, it's certainly not Danish. I'd be most grateful. I'll read them again before and that will be the end of the show. So I hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week.
