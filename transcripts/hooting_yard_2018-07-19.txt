Welcome to fuding yard on the air. I have not Frankie. But Frank he is with me you'll be pleased to hear. But I thought I'd start this week show by giving you all a fashion sequence just to make sure we're all in sequence that from 1272 to 1527 there was a simple monk style 1327 to 99 pointed shoes and sleeves 1399 to 1461 bullhorn hats, hence narrow central reaction. Next theatrical 1461 to 85 well shouichi narrow central hats 1485 to 1509 Square curtain to bed fashion peak, tall thin people 1509 to 1547 Square wooden Henry the Eighth puff sleeves 1547 to 58 dark fan skirt, Spanish 1558 to 1603 and this would be fun Drake, bearded pirate, Big Tent waist and shoulders 1603 to 25 odd big waists and narrow metal thorax. 1625 to 49 then die Cavalier, untrustworthy, lacks floppy 1649 to 60 dark Welsh witchy 1660 to 89 dark brigand Quaker hats 1689 to 1714 tall narrow heads reaction 1714 to 27 black Red Riding Hood 1727 to 60 big waists 1760 to 90 big heads 1792 1837 long and thick squashed 1837 to 60 wooden thick 1860 to 80. overdone 1880 to 1900 odd 1901 to 1918 contrived 1918 to 30s flighty freaks 1940 to 45 war frenzy mean to lower middle class on 1946 to 48 Peak find simple bold quality middle class fashion. Peak fine fashions occurred in the 14th century, semi late 15th century, late 15th century 1515 1695 1896 1946 to eight. And that, of course, was the pronouncement of the wonderful Norman Davies from further science book 20. More of which later

well thanks to pansy cradle Jew for that. pansies actually wearing Welsh weekly narrow head, block hat or whatever it was. So she's a woman out of time. And

something that has always puzzled me about the famous story in which the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog is its lack of detail ever since It first appeared in the Michigan School moderator in 1885. It's been a popular and well known story, and I would guess that most people will know its basic outline. There's a fox Excuse me, there's a fox which is quick and round, and it jumps over a dog which is lazy. Even the most harebrained dimwit can understand that. And it's made all the more vivid by being told in the present tense. That gives it a sense of immediacy, such that we could almost be present witnessing The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. Yeah, I cannot be alone in thinking that the tail leaves too many unanswered questions. Of course, as sophisticated readers, we do not necessarily want everything handed to us on a plate, we expect to do some work. And part of the pleasure of the tale well told, is that we may well have to exercise our imaginations to fill in the gaps to flesh out details to complete a picture, which is only hinted at. But in the story of the Fox and the dog, there is so much missing from the narrative that were ultimately dissatisfied.

Frank Key  06:12
Even the few details we are given begged further questions. How quick is the fox exactly? quickness is surely relative? Is the fox quicker or slower than, say, a tortoise or a steam train? Does it move with the swiftness of a traveling through the air or have Akita without having any moving object to compare it with, we have no idea of its speed. The only other thing we know about the fox is that it's brown. Well, that tells us a little given that there are innumerable shades of brown, from amber to diamond from done to Amber, and all sorts of others are cannot be bothered to list. If we were to grab hold of the folks and hold it up against a paint chart, a grid of squares of various shades of brown. Where would we stop and cry? Aha, look how closely the color of this Fox struggling in our grasp and attempting to bite our wrist matches the color of that square, such that if we painted the room with it from floor to ceiling, we would render the fox invisible. We do not know the answer to that question. Things are even less satisfactory. In the case of the dog. At least with the fox we're given two snippets of information Vegas both those snippets may be but all we're told of the dog is that it's lazy. It's true that being a personality trait. The imputation of laziness tells us more much more about the character of the dog than we ever learned about the character of the fox. insightful as this may be, however, it's meager pickings. Fast, we have several questions directly related to what little we do know how many more are thrown up when we consider what we're not told. What manner of dog is it? Is it asleep or awake? Has it been recently fed? Is it sound of limb? Does it wear a color too? Which is a fixed a small round metal tag with its name engraved upon it? Is it a homeless stray? Where the hell is the damn dog anyway? On a loom outside a kennel inside a kennel. As the questions multiply, we begin to lose patience with the dog. If it were real rather than fictional, we would be tempted to kick it, or at least to throw the stick for it to go and fetch were to overcome its laziness. As a dog in a story leaves much to be desired. One things briefly and fugitive live the Hound of the Baskervilles or the lap dog belonging to the lady in the checkout story. No doubt you can add your own fictional dogs. By any measure. The lazy dog in the presence story is a pretty sorry specimen. We might point to similar an endless list of questions about the fox. If we're so minded, frankly, the prospect is worrying. The sad fact is, we know in advance that repeated readings of the story will help us answer none of them. If we put aside the Fox and the dog and consider in isolation, the action of the story, we realize how feeble it is. We have as much idea of the motivation of the fox in jumping over the dog as Tippi Hedren had about that scene in the birds were her character Melanie Daniels. inexplicably and the room full of savage frenzy birds. At least tippy had the wit to ask Alfred Hitchcock Why on earth Melanie would be so stupid. We do not know if the fox is being equally stupid, or wise or perhaps merely playful. It might be lacking. Sorry, it might be locking about for no apparent reason. But as readers, we want to know. I must confess that I became so exasperated with the writer of this story, the law determined to send one of mandatories letters of remonstrance recipients among them, Jeanette Winterson will sell from them like Iris Murdoch, and Oda quaking in their boots, and make abject promises to mend their ways. Then I recalled that the story of the Fox and the dog was originally published in 1885. And thus, barring a freak of nature, the author was almost certainly dead and gone to that place from when done return except zombies. I pummeled the cushion in my frustration.

Frank Key  11:15
My next step was to go to the Wolverine state and to trawl through the archives of the Michigan School moderator, hoping to lay my hands on working notes, early draft and possibly alternative versions of the tale. Then I intend to publish a long overdue critical addition, annotated with scholarly notes of at least 800 pages, including color plates with mezzotints of a fox quickened brown and a dog lazy. I think I shall ask Tippi Hedren to write the foreword.

Frank Key  12:31
These are the voyages of the starship corrugated cardboard. It's five year mission to seek out somewhere in the illimitable vastness of space. The Planet of the crumpled Jesuits. This is a needle in a haystack stuff. Unless you've boldly gone across the universe yourself aboard one of the other starships. You really can have no idea just what a palaver it is. So, some sympathy, please. When I was called into starship command four and a half years ago, all I knew was that I was going to be made captain of a mission. What I did not know was the nature of that mission. I was excited for this was to be my first captaincy. I had plenty of experience as a boson and a Crow's Nester on both ships and starships. I had done the so called milk round, delivering bottles of milk to far flung space colonies, such as New traywick and far district near isle of muck. I had served my time playing between the dismal little planetoids of galaxy 14, eradicating the bind weed, and setting up diversity and outreach initiatives. I have even been to the furthest and most distant planet of all, the one with the weird Voodoo Rastafarian belief system and giant cyclopean, turtles, and sweet smelling Marsh gas. But none of these voyages had prepared me for the mission to find somewhere in the illimitable vastness of space, the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits. The story goes that several hundred years ago, on a meal when a gang of Jesuits grew tired of earthly ways, and set out in a secondhand spaceship to find a deserted planet. There, they were to establish a Jesuit ethical paradise if one could imagine such a thing. They quite clearly did. But what they cannot afford seen was their gradual crumpling, which began shortly after they landed on their distant world and proceeded a pace with ghastly consequences. Now Every single Jesuit on the planet with a picture of almost unimaginable crumble meant paradise it might have been, but a paradise tinge with crumbles. This much was this much we knew from radio reports picked up by a space scooter. The news core something of a hubbub when it reached Earth. certain members of the interplanetary council were livid, others more sanguine, but the livid ones won the day, and it was they who insisted on sending a mission to find the planet. Because of the space scooters onboard radio scrambling system. It was an unfathomable mystery from where the Stark and crumpled messages have been sent. I did ask starship command what I was meant to do after I found the planet and was given an envelope marked further instructions to be opened only after the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits has been located and that location confirmed. I kept the envelope tucked into a pocket of my starship captains smoke. It's a fine smoke model on the ones worn by 19th century peasants in rustic English backwaters. rustic backwaters is a good is as good a description as any of the many and various worlds we have visited. During the last four and a half years. We have seen incredible things, most of them involving potatoes, hay and space straw, but to date, we have not encountered a crumpled, Jesuit and crumpled ones yes on certain other planets, a list of which I maintain in my logbook. Most planets after all, or at least most of the ones that support life have a Jesuit as they have an alderman and a town crier and a haberdasher, and a man whose job it is to club sales. My crew and I have gained deep and penetrating insight into the basic patterns of the known universe.

Frank Key  17:18
And we have taken tea with the Voodoo Rastafarians of that most distant of all planets. It was our first port of call. Knowing that some members of my crew would suffer from terrible homesickness, I decided to ease their sufferings by the simple expedient of cell arranging things, that for the bulk of our voyage, we would be heading earthwards, in a roundabout way of course, but generally with the starships nose pointing towards home as a result of my capitani wisdom, morale has been high, where the average starship voyage is a purgatory of lassitude, grumpiness, longing and weeping. The corrugated cardboard is a truck and ship with Piccolo recitals and flower arranging contests, and grafting, tournament's and games of quotes and monkey diversas and all sorts of other recreations. On Sundays. I prance and skip about with a fairy wand. The only tears are tears of happiness. Yet for all that there is mounting tension, with only six months before our sheduled landing starship command HQ at Clacton on sea. We are all too aware that we're in danger of failure. There has been no sign of anything even resembling the Planet of the crumbled Jesuits. Our daily prayers are not helping, even though we say them in Latin, and we're vestments. The envelope in my pocket remains unopened. I know I cannot ask for more time. For one thing the fuel will run out. Also the emergency boosters packed up after we had to make a quick getaway from a plan is in Sector nine, which turned out to be inhabited entirely by starving befogged and ferocious giants bass donkeys. The chief engineer a duel Scott, like all good starship chief engineers has been faffing about with the boosters day in day out, but they still make a horrible creaking noise and sputter out. called perhaps it's the chief engineer who makes the creaking noise. He may be more elderly than I had been led to believe. Or the space time continuum might be playing tricks on us. I've heard rumors of such things. But we must keep our Packers up. Today is the feast day of St. Ignatius Loyola. We will continue on our voyage aboard the stars. corrugated cardboard with hope in our hearts. So we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the gravitational field of the Planet of the crumpled Jesuits

was a very short interlude, but the impromptu and very amateur intro to that last piece reminded me that Gene Roddenberry the late grey Gene Roddenberry actually wrote lyrics to the Star Trek theme. I don't remember all the words but I do know the first two lines were beyond the rim of the starlight My love is wandering in Star flight. She may have done Have you heard this? Oh, okay. It would not surprise me. It would not surprise me.

Did you know that Michelle Nichols brother Terry was a member of the Hale Bopp comet cult who committed suicide? Yes, I did. Hey Gary Nichols

Unknown Speaker  21:21
any Star Trek afficionado with know that I'm sure well, from from the stars to something a little bit more down to earth but not too close to Earth. This is a treatise on bird psychologies. Number one, that birds appear to be of two basic opposite psychologies, the whole and the knob psychologies too, hence male and female dominant. And all species using nesting boxes, our whole psychology birds and these are largely patch colored course or tree crevice birds, tits, etc. While open nesting bird genus, goals, etc. Seed eating finches etc. are basically not psychology birds, and do not use nesting boxes, etc.

Frank Key  22:36
I've got another piece to read you. I don't know if I've got time to read the whole thing but so I decided what I'll do is read something that's so nonsensical, but if it Peters out halfway through, it doesn't really matter. Well, let's see how we got. As an advanced stage, the gunk is scraped off with a tallow knife collected and apart, reduced by steaming and fed to sea horses. After several days, the sea horses begin to display intricate and abnormal behavior patterns. These patterns can be traced on graph paper with propelling pencils and a ruler. Comparing comparison with earlier graphs done under a double blind test have proved immensely illuminating. So luminous indeed, that copied out onto onion skin paper and crumpled up they can be inserted into glass bulbs and light along the corridor in a large building for upwards of four days. By the fourth day they are dimming there is a dying of the light and sensitive persons mourn as more than they might. Having dispose of the gunk as described, the main bulk is best fed through a sieve. The most effective sieve to use is one with so called swedenborg in ANGEL holes. These are not generally available in the shops, but can be ordered direct by post from the manufacturers. thus keeping costs surprisingly low. You might want to purchase two or three at one time. The fragile nature of the sieve means that it will not, alas survive much use. It's easily distressed, especially when you try to force stuff through the holes as certain boisterous and reckless persons tend to do. If you have such a person on your team, it's a good idea to keep them away from the sibs by telling them to go and keep an eye on the seahorses. Other pesky or exasperating team members can be usefully employed and kept out of your hair by laying the plumb line. This should consist of 10 pegs and butcher string and stretch as far as the eye can see. the vine Should I do Be at the height of an average hollyhock. The calculation being made by consulting the table at the back of the annual hollyhock height register. A copy of this ought to be in your local reference library, but will usually not be available for borrowing. So, literacy and numeracy member of the team with a valid library ticket should be delegated to copy out the required details. They can use the back of the graph paper on which the behavior patterns of the sea horses have earlier been inscribed in majestic sweeping lines and arcs of unsurpassed beauty. Meanwhile, having fed the main bolt through the sieve into a bucket, the bucket can now be ferried to the platform. This should stand on sturdy props, the sturdy the better. Do not on any account, use balsa wood. You're probably familiar with the case of Tarleton and what transpired with his balsa wood Prop, if necessary. Test the structures using the standard tests of sturdiness which appear as appendix seven in your instruction pamphlet. Otherwise, proceed directly to the siphon and funnel pallava. siphon the stuff out of the bucket working slowly and methodically and seamlessly. as it passes through the funnel. take snapshots at one minute intervals from the designated angles. These need not be full color snapshot unless they've been explicitly explicitly specified in the contract. That's certainly an unusual clause nowadays. And if it does appear it's worth checking. The contract might after all have been drawn up by a half wit. Try to ensure that no seahorses are visible in the background and the snapshots. The whole lot safer. The scraped of gunk should now be transferred into beakers without spillage.

Frank Key  27:08
Align the beakers along the plumb line. Once they're in place and only when they're in place. Attach the snap on snap off lids. Using a thick, bold black indelible marker pen. Draw identifying symbols on the lids. For examples of app symbols, see appendix nine. Make sure each one is different. There is often a temptation to repeat the seahorse symbol because it's so fecking fight against this temptation with all your might like Christ in the wilderness. In case of rainfall, it will be necessary to cover both beakers and plumbline with tarpaulins. The approved color is an almost transparent light blue, and the other color is likely to result in fewer points being awarded without the right of appeal. Again, the case of Tarleton should give you pause if you're thinking of using black or yellow tarpaulin, or God forbid a particularly opaque one. It was not amusing when talvin had to account for himself before the panel. The seahorses tiny brains will by now be utterly ravaged, scoop them from the tank with a standard anglers net and deposit them on the slab, one by one using a very sharp kitchen knife. Remove the brain from each seahorse. If you feel pangs of pity in your soul, you're pursuing the wrong hobby, and we'd be better off taking up ping pong. Place the brains in a brown paper bag. I'm going to leave it there. I'll leave you in suspense. And if I remember, I'll read you the final bit of that next week, which will be the final show before the summer break. So you've got the seahorse brains in the brown paper bag. I hope you have been following the instructions while listening. So that's the end of this week show thanks to john for the sound engineering and pansy cradle Joe for reading Norman Davis and singing the Star Trek theme tune. I think that was a great pleasure. Bye bye until next week.
