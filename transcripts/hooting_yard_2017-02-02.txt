Frank Key  00:27
Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four f m, or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air Episode 38. I've been asked to compile a report on the tosspot It's a great honor and I hope to equip myself with really fantastic splendor. That would be a feather in my cap. I decided that the best way to approach the task bot is to tackle him fruit by fruit. It's not that fruit looms large in his toss pottery, but dimples Denver's as they say in Latin, they being the tosspot acolytes. Before proceeding with, I hope, fantastic splendor, it's meat to say a few words about those acolytes. Not every lower case tosspot has acolytes, but the definitively upper case tosspot does. That goes without saying? So why did I say it? Ah, for the same reason that we're going to tackle him fruit by fruit. The tosspot acolyte come in a variety of caps and colors, but what they all have in common is possession of a key to the hillside sanctum. It is as fine a sanctum as anybody in search of a sanctum could wish for. Set halfway up the hillside concealed by salary beds of hobby Hawks. It is both stony and capacious. There is a joke going around that the tosspot is himself stony and capacious, and the Acolytes guff for, though it's unclear what, if anything, it means I gathered myself when I first heard it, to see one of the in crowd, but so many and various were my slips and fumbles in other respect, that I was always marked as an outsider. That's perhaps why I've been entrusted to write this report. an acolyte will just with adoringly, like a Moonstruck cough. With the fruit by fruit approach, it's essential to get the fruits in the correct order. Otherwise, even the most fantastically splendid Report Writer can get into all sorts of pickles. I know that to my cost. A while ago, I was asked to write a report of that back. A while ago, I was asked to write a report about bike whackers. You might think that's a topic that does not lend itself to the fruit by fruit approach. But you'd be wrong. Very, very wrong. But I made the fatal mistake of starting off with plums, then bananas. And quite frankly, after that I was done for the report was binned. And justifiably so. I'm not going to make the same mistake again, which is why for my tosspot report, I decided to place the fruits in a very specific order, one derived from a close reading of certain obscure texts by Madame blavatsky. HPB herself does not actually refer to any fruits in the passages I consulted. But that's the point of my close reading, to eat from her words, meanings which may not have been apparent even to her. You cannot read just any old writer using this method and expect results. I've tried it for example, with a driver haggard, Mary carelli and Dennis Wheatley, and in each case, I ended up in a perfect flap. Either my fruits were in a blisteringly chaotic order, or there was no hint of fruit or come to that of order. I ended up having to visit a green grocer and buy one of each fruit and align them by hand across the table, which took hours and even then I had no idea if the order was appropriate to my purposes. But I know I can trust Madame blavatsky at least in this regard. The order of fruits is one thing however, while the broader ramifications of a report on the tosspot or something else again, quibbles aside, there is the question of tone. Though, come to think of it having mentioned quibbles, casting them to one side is easier said than done. My bike wangka report suffered from a surfeit of quibbles quite apart from the fruit order did Baikal tries on light to shove them out of sight and out of mind, they can rearing their heads and snorting sometimes definitely. I plugged my ears with cotton wool to no avail. Eventually, I had to go out to a park bench to write my report thinking that the sight of ducks in a duck pond across a lawn punctuated by beds of lupins would help me settled for the right frame of mind. It did to some extent, but then it began to rain, and I do not recommend writing in the rain, ink gets smudged

Frank Key  05:29
tone, no tone for the tosspot Why should it be valedictory captures smitten, it would be easy enough to adapt a toss pottage tone, if one had a gift for such, but to do so word, I think like a certain dignity. And it would just not sit well with the fruit by fruit approach, which is if it's anything, the pinnacle of dignity, I would defy anyone to write a report on any subject under the sun, adopting a fruit by fruit approach, and not thereby impart to one's text, a measure of dignity unsurpassed. And let's face it, the tosspot himself presents a pretty undignified figure at the best of times. Those trousers alone are enough to turn the strongest of stomachs, I will not even begin to describe the socks. In fact, I'm not going to mention the socks in my report, I shall go straight from undignified trousers to undignified boots, and it will be as if the socks never existed. That's the best way. Believe me. I know where have I speak. haven't given the matter much thought and product that thought by gazing for several hours at Madame blavatsky milky gray eyes and a photograph, I have concluded that the tone of my report ought to be set by what we call the fruit test. The idea with this technique is to get inside the fruit as it were, and then to allow the fruit to dictate the tone of one's text. It's absolutely critical of course that one selects the proper fruit for the task. Putting the fruits in the correct order is child's play by comparison. Somewhat surprisingly, the very worst thing one can do is to use real items of fruit, bought from a green grocer lined up along the table to make one selection. That's what a naive young reporter would do. After all, it seems to make sense. But as my mentor said to me from within the dark interior of his booth, in his booming voice, beware, beware of real fruit. the import of what he said was not clear to me then, but by Heaven, it is now in spades with brass knobs on. And so I don my special gloves and I cut some capers, and I prepare myself to pick the most important fruit I shall ever pick.

Frank Key  08:22
We've had a sort of theme in the previous 1337 episodes of hooting yard on the air of plums. And so here's another piece that piece just mentioned a plum once and what do you know, plums turn up again in this next piece. I went to the shops and bought a car of bad plum. I the plum and through the stoner to swan. The plum stone hit the swan on its beak. I repeated this every day for a week. Then the next morning I woke up in bed to find Seven swans on the pillow beside my head like honked and packed and I was undone. So I went to the shops for another plum. But the plump stir saw my savaged condition and damned me to Hellfire and prediction. I'll sell no further Columbus to the he said and that was the end of plums and me. Now I choose to eat other fruit and non fruit based snacks to boat. As for swarms. They're still in my room, where they will stay to like go to my tomb

Frank Key  10:04
changing the subject completely. Then we're going to have a little bit of music news and songs for strangled puppies is a new album of sentimental ballads by tear stained balladeer Biff kromski. a follow up to his smash hit bestseller songs for drowned kittens. I'm particularly proud of my new waxing said Biff. In an interview with top dead puppy and kitten magazine, the dailies more slaughtered animals digest. Because the body count is slightly higher than on my previous album that had only one or two kittens drowned per song. Whereas on the new one, I think several schmaltzy ballads, in which upwards of a dozen puppies have the life squeezed out of them. In one case, by the lumbering walrus mustache serial killer babinski, turning his attention for once to the canine world. This is not the first time bubinski has been celebrated in song, though earlier numbers have stood the test of time the ballad approach. More often they have been hideous screeching and howlings, composed by bearded grumpy avant garde German networks such as horse gak and by horse ghacks familia, a weird hug monk keyless which perches on his shoulder, and his isn't passes by. I was hoping to get Horst ghacks homunculus to join me on a duet said Biff Chomsky. But when I approached him, he bit me. I immediately had a tetanus jab, but it didn't do much good. Ever since I've had a fever and an au, and fits and convulsions. And to be honest, I'm not sure when I'll be able to get back in the studio to record my next album songs for garate baby koala bears. copy of the new album comes with a free tin pail in which weeping listeners can collect their tears.

Frank Key  12:41
Just a reminder, this point in Episode 38, that there is a hooting yard website it's a hooting yard.org hooting yard is one word.org. And I would recommend you go and visit you can read everything I've ever read on the radio, and more besides 1313 1414 years worth of babbling. And there's, you can buy books, paperback compilations of stories, and you can donate money and you can donate to our Christmas appeal. This is our Christmas appeal for 2016, in which the lines are still open. And please give generously. This year's Christmas appeal which runs until December the 24th. is in aid of the fund for distressed half blind out of print pamphleteers. So, do go and do that. Or you can just go and you can just go and read all the stuff but think about think about the fact that has been given to you free of charge for almost a decade and a half. And if it's ever given you the smallest smidgen of pleasure, and perhaps you could send me 40 Pence, or perhaps more. I don't know. Anyway, yes, you go and visit the website. And meanwhile, on the pier, a milk salt bellowed he was shouting at the sea. Ordinarily we do not think of bellowing as something milk sobs do but this particular milk SOP was that rare creature a Bama wing milks up? He felt compelled to mince to the very end of every pair he came to there to Bama the terrible see his babbling was largely worthless and incoherent like a performance piece by Yoko Ono, though every now and then a sliver of sense could be picked up by an alert listener. These fragments were noted down by his Boswell with a propelling pencil in a notepad the milk SOP Boswell whose name for today Asli was Boswell followed the milk SOP from peer to peer lagging always several paces behind him. Boswell himself was no milk SOP. He had once been a wrestler of average repute. Here is a sample page from one of the notepads. The pair at Ember sent bibley did die morning. Weather balmy. Oh, vast wet sea. Glebe of havoc. Neither hoity toity. War is over if you want it. Calm Toppy downs krakken dexys midnight runner beans. When the milk stops bellowing has exhausted him, and he slouched panting on the pair. His Boswell tucked propelling pencil and notepad into his pocket, took the milks up in his arms and carried him all the way back along the pier to the seaside boarding house, where earlier, the pair had rented a pair of rooms. He deposited the milk syrup on his bed, then went to a nearby cafeteria to work up the latest slivers of sent into a grammatically impeccable letter to the editor of the local seaside newspaper. few if any of these letters were ever published. In the evenings, Boswell would listen to the football results on the wireless while the milks are priced in a Gazetteer, a footpath to the next Pier. As darkness fell, lanterns were lit and cucumber sandwiches were scuffed.

Frank Key  16:47
The milk syrup was usually too exhausted from his bellowing to make conversation with Boswell. But every now and then, if he swallowed a vitamin supplement, he might manage to ask Boswell to recount an anecdote from his wrestling days. Boswell was reluctant to do so. He was still plagued by nightwear might not. He was still plagued by nightmares involving half Nelson's and blind tags and dusty finishes. And he found excuses to this to dimir. He would complain of a fictional sore throat or point out of the window that strange swooping nocturnal birds, or even sometimes marched out of the boarding house and down to the beach to dig pointless holes in the sand. Leaving the milk shop alone sprawled on his bed, weakly picking up breadcrumbs from his chin and deposit human in a bedside breadcrumb tin. It had no lid so many pears, so much bellowing so little sense. They were golden years that now resemble lead.

Frank Key  18:28
I mentioned earlier horse ghacks airy familiar, a homunculus perched on his shoulder which hissed at passers by and bit those who came too close. It has long been a source of fascination for a handful of nitwits with nothing better to fill their time. And it's now the subject of the magisterial new biography. Deep human curious that trout von ghac the result of several hours of slapdash research by tonic potboiler wrist shachar Kido cop cars a second or possibly third cousin of our own deer pebble head. From the book, we've learned some startling fact. If Of course we can read German. If we cannot an accent to translation, we would be better advised to use it as a doorstop or to hold down the corner of the tarpaulin in a gale. One of the less startling things we learn is that the familiar with created using the standard para celsion recipe paracelsus 1493 to 1541, whose real name was philippus oriolus Theo fastest bombast as Vaughn hohenheim made the first known homerun killers from a bag of bones, skin fragments, sperm and animal hair. He placed these ingredients in the ground surrounded by horsemen. You for 40 days, after which the embryo sprang into being horse gap would appear to have followed this precisely with the addition of some lupins and half a Cochise. Interestingly, we discovered that the homerun culus was absolutely identical to its maker in all respects. Save it sighs It was a miniature horse get down to it stylish Louis brilliant team suit, trendy Winkle pickers and fantastic boufal based as wild horses get on the great wavered Kanagawa by hokusai. Its temperament, mean and behavior will also have a piece with ghacks particularly the hissing and biting. The only thing that a monk killer seemed unable to do was to conduct huge ensembles in recitals of god awful, semi improvised avant garde racket, though not for one to crying keys on cop tells and in counting anecdote of the homunculus, trying to teach various flies midges, gnats, and blue bottles to play the theremin, Piccolo, xylophone and Cuba without success. The sessions were recorded however, and I think the publisher ought to have included a CD of the surviving tape it would have made for a more rounded portrayed of horse gets familiar. One question which the biography does not address is why the homunculus was forever perfect on host gags shoulder. It was a fully functioning tiny creature, and could quite easily have scampered off and made its own way in the world. Yet it preferred always to remain as if glued to its maker, hissing at him and biting him when there was nobody else in the vicinity to torment. The missing voice in all this, of course, is that of course gak himself, who apparently tried to block the book's publication. The grounds cited in his legal case included a claim that the biography lacked gak and was last Dippy floppy and poopy. The finest legal minds in Germany are still considering the matter, which experts say may not be resolved until sometime in the next century. In the meantime, an illegal pirated edition of the book is in circulation, and has sold upwards of eight copies. It should be noted that I do not read German and there may be wild and unforgiveable inaccuracies in the foregoing.

Frank Key  23:14
I have to say that modern cinema is in a sorry state. Increasingly, it seems Hollywood is only interested in witless superhero franchises. So the same film is recycled time and time again, with ever diminishing returns. These are films for adolescents, not adults. And such basic elements is plot character and genuine drama, as sacrificed in the interest of mere spectacle. Why bother with say snappy dialogue, when the when the audience will be happy with an endless series of big noisy explosions. Which makes it all the more puzzling that Hollywood has thus far neglected the one superhero who I would love to see depicted on the big screen. I'm talking of course of piffle boy piffle boy was the creation of Maverick comic book genius last town, and his adventures were recounted between March and July 1974 in the pages of the now extremely rare, perform boy comic. Set in a generic American metropolis. The stories tell of a young mild mannered milk sob, who is passionately devoted to his button collection. Yet he has a secret life as a crime fighter, righting wrongs, taking out the hoodlums and keeping the city streets safe. He does this by using his superpower with wick he was imbued following a bizarre chemical reaction caused by some of the buttons in his collection being dropped in a puddle. piffle boys superpower is an ability to spout absolute petal extemporary and that length, which drives those listening crackers, leaving them confused and befuddled, like decapitated chickens. In a typical adventure, piffle boy we'll be sitting at home with his buttons when he receives an alert on his piffle phone, telling him that ne'er do wells are bent on villainy somewhere in the city. Immediately piffle boy minces to the scene and starts babbling Arthur piffle, the evil miscreants, as soon reduced to a state of discombobulation whereupon the cops arrived and dragged them and protesting of the prison. Each episode ends with the captain of detectives saying, gee thanks, piffle. Boy, if it weren't for you, we'd never have rounded up these hoods and made the city safe again. To which piffle boy replies. Glad to be of service captain. Now I must get back to my buttons. devoted fans of piffle boy memorize long passages of his most piffling piffle, and meet at conventions, where they recite it to each other in loud yet curiously weedy voices. Mark talc was taught by the noted hyper realist artist Rex hyper and not the least of the columns of the piffle boy comics are his hyper realistic illustrations, one of which is reproduced on the hooting yard website where you can go and look at it. This shows piffle boy in the immediate aftermath of the famous episode, in which he foils the criminal schemes of bootleggers samagra McGrew and his gang by Wittering piffle at them for several hours, until the tardy cops eventually show up. And as I say, you can go and see a picture of a hyper realist illustration of powerful boy on the hooting yard website, hooting owl.org it only appeared quite recently. So if you scroll down, it should still be on the first page. And if if that doesn't work for you just put piffle boy into the hooting yards search box at the top of the page or near the top of the page. And that is pretty much it for this week. There's not that much time left certainly not time enough for me to start reading anything of any great length. So I have an announcement to make, because john has just handed me a laminated sheet of a laminated thing of a4 paper, which contains the following important message. It's happening dot dot, dot, dot,

Frank Key  28:07
the annual resonance fundraiser Saturday, the 11th to Sunday, the 19th of February 2017. do go to fundraiser.resonance.fm. For info on how to give. It's happening. The annual resonant fundraiser Saturday, the 11th to Sunday, the 19th February 2017. do go to fundraiser.resonance.fm for info on how to give. And I think yeah, that's that's about it for this week. Yes, you'll be able to give money to resonance after you give them money to hunting yard and then just think you won't have any money left to spend on fripperies like fruit. Bye bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:38
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans of the Nerds who wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you.
