Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. I've been told that Eric is listening tonight. So prick up your ears, Eric, and listen carefully. And I haven't been here for a couple of weeks because I've been suffering from terrible, terrible illness. And so what happened and then the three weeks ago, when I was here, I was already on the on the way down. And the show was rather dilapidated, really, and I didn't get a chance, as I had meant to do to finish reading House of terps, which is a 1989 out of print pamphlet, published by the malice of forethought, press. Copies of which fetch ludicrous sums on on eBay. So, Robert, lighter than planned. I'm going to finish reading map today, chapters seven and eight of House of terps. So without further ado, let us press on. The reverse thing that happened was that someone called Slava Dan karpin, was told that he was trapped in a, in a sort of subterranean civilization beneath the Arctic. And the he was told there was no way out. And he said, Crikey. And we now move on. Move on to chapter seven, of House of Turkey. What a terrible predicament. How on earth did karpin escape? What Wiles did he employed to evade the clutches of the subterranean devils? Was it really necessary for necessary for him to dye his head a shade of lavender, and to stand in elegantly upon one leg? tubing on the pips of a blood orange? Where had he acquired the blood orange? Was it fresh? If so, through what conduit had it found its way to a community living hundreds of feet below the Arctic ice. If such a conduit existed, could Kirpan not take advantage of it? If fresh fruit and in all likelihood vegetables could travel one way? Surely it would be possible for karpin to travel the other way out of his prison, away from certain death beyond the reaches of the macabre who did figure whose ritual task was to boil terpenes head. How could kerpen discover what he needed to know? What did kerpen need to know? Would it do to have any a vague idea of what was going on? Or would it be necessary for him to amass a copious body of information on site routes, timetables? sheduled inventories Terry's and registers when he needed a Gazetteer? How much time would he need in order to gather all the necessary information? Where could he begin? Could cup him bribe this early snag tooth valid whose job it was to monitor his every move? With what could the wreck be bought bribed? With a packet of boiled sweet suffice? was the man partial to linseed oil? Did he own a pencil case? Did karpin still have his pencil case? What had happened to his rucksack was his mind failing. Why did his brain throb so? How long had he been in this place? Why did the refreshments they plied him with tastes so strange. With what infusions? Was he being poisoned? Was he being poisoned? Was this an awful problem and Rita his execution? Why have they removed the address from his shoe laces? Why have they returned them a few hours later, brightly gleaming as if they'd been polished heartily with beeswax and formed over by a winery smiling drug. Had they been so polished so formed over? Did it matter? Where was Kirpan able to get hold of the lavender, dark? Why did he not arouse the suspicions of his captors? Or did he did they only pretend to see nothing suspicious? When he absented himself for four hours from the potato gala

were they in fact conniving against him always time, loving him into a false sense of security, allowing him access to the dye buckets, the blood oranges and the Flamingo tent in order to mislead him. Was he backing up the wrong scent? Had he been thrown off the alley? Was he being led up a blind tree? Was wall what mattered? had his hair been shown? Could corncrakes take shape, shimmering in his fancy, blue and blurred, baleful woozy creaking. If I took out the rest of his teeth, they fed in slops, they smeared nuggets on his forehead, and they smirk they smeared nuga on his forehead, and lime in his path. He was shown engravings of great deed strange creatures, fearsome engines, hideous disasters, fibs and lies, lies and fifth rain flashed on his head and the water in his cup turned to ice. The clanging of bells announced his coming, but his ears were stuffed with potty and he heard them not. Then the word goes broke. It made a dreadful sound karpin had he known it would have been thankful for his party. The word go in tandem, monstrous litany asst screeching out the provenance of each verse. When the word go drew breath. The word goes mask shock as it spilled fourth, it's awful words, reading from a completely incomprehensible manuscript on earth that morning from an iron chest, sprinkled with vinegar and Jew lab ceremoniously chewed at the edges stained with smoke. Why not last the word goes ceased, drapes were pulled around karpin a death toll upon him with sudden ferocity. After the requisite period of mourning for the dead chieftain, the ritual ran its course, the chambers he had inhabited during his brief stay among the people were sealed off huge titanium port calluses, barring the doors by would remain in place for 40 years. If another chieftain came among them within that time, other chambers would be found less well appointed smaller and smelly, perhaps, but adequate, no chieftain had yet lasted more than a fortnight before being executed. Once the poor calluses were in place, every single churn in the community was used for making the batter of grievance flags were burned. Toy socks were given to all the children with an inky likeness of the word goes mask stamped upon them. Somehow, one of the socks found its way into Caribbean's rucksack, and the rucksack instead of being placed on the pyre, along with every other trace of his existence, was accidentally launched in a crevasse by mod Oh Hargreaves, or her next incognito mission to the surface many months later. Accidentally, it seems doubtful, but they're the rucksack lay frozen a time capsule awaiting discovery.

Now, finally, Chapter Eight of houses. Apparently they were to slobber down the curtains flourishing at the same period. We have followed the career of the so called chemist chieftain the legendary figure whose rucksack was discovered in a crevasse by last touts expedition party in 19. Blanc, tout himself pieced together the known facts of kerbin life and it is upon his work that the proceeding drivel is based. It has to be said much of the detail of karpin last days, including the suppose diary entry is pure conjecture. In the wealth and the Drudge tout apologist gravel slobber casts an intriguing light on his impression To biographical methods, and I quote, faced with seemingly insurmountable hurdle stays narrative, ie utter lack of evidence, uncorroborated anecdotes, etc, etc. Tout would always follow the same procedure. Rising dawn, he would armed himself with a high velocity rifle and set out for the malls spending the morning letting off a dozen rounds of ammunition to spectacularly small effect. He was once known to bag a muskrat, but later admitted that it was half dead when he found it. Returning by way of a hostelry towel could drink innumerable pints of spout and chew on a hunk of black bread. belching and reeling, he would stagger home, but fast the doors of his study, and at once set about scrawling whatever pitiful nonsense came into his head, writing with a quick bio on massive sheets of bleach newspaper. These semi spontaneous press clippings would be revised in the calm of the evening by sludge is factotum using a variety of dictionaries, encyclopedias, threes, and lexicons. On a number of occasions, more conventional scholars have covered some of talc ground and his in Jubilee, stupid working methods were found to be surprisingly effective. For example, He correctly guessed the reasons for build group build groups, pumice mania, which Mac and gubbins were able to corroborate in their posthumous study, talent could not have had access to the archive. And even if he had his command, the Flemish was never up to match. Finish was another matter. Unquote. Slava is generous in his assessment, but in the absence of any other material, we have to give out the benefit of the doubt. He did, after all, discover Kirpan rucksack wedged in an Arctic kvass. In his book, he gives the precise map references. In 19, blank tout held an exhibition in which he claimed that the entire contents of the rucksack we're on show. Sure enough, the catalog lists all of Kevin's ludicrous Ecwid pouch and many little bags of rotted matter, once presumably samples to be used in poultice manufacturer and there is mentioned to have various notebooks and diaries, tantalizing indeed, though not a living soul recall seeing them and no trace of them has ever been found. Of course, we know that malefactors ransacked tax country pile a week after his death, but would they have taken old papers, yellowing, religious crumbling notebooks? all the evidence suggests that they were mentally defective opportunists whose loot consisted only of three source burns, a tray of worms, and some grit. For carpet, then we must rely on talc. To date his drunken ramblings are all we have, even the earlier period of kirkenes life has been covered over by history with a shroud of neglect. Wherever we turn, his life seems to have been erased. records have been lost or burned or half eaten by grubs and mildew. All those who knew him and they were not many along dead, and they have left nothing but dust and Ashes, ashes and dust. So our knowledge of Kirkland is town's knowledge and talc to his in his tube.

Sadly, even less is known about the other Slobodan karpin, the one we encountered at the beginning, implanting a wooden flagpole in the sword. Indeed, we know nothing of him at all, save for that solitary act. Our source in this case is the hooting yard Gazette for the 14th of January 18. Blank, which carries a small paragraph on an inside page mentioning his deed thought worthy of note because because the perpetrator had quote, a lantern draw and a translucent yellow fog watch, unquote, but this is a we know of the other Kirpan. And it's only worth knowing because quite by chance, he planted his flag pole on the very spot where a year later, the foundation stone was laid. of the house of tubs

So that was the kind of thing I was writing in the last century and and then in the 20th 21st century or at least the first decade of it 2007 to be precise, which is almost well, nine and a half years ago March 2007 I wrote this clop stocks jug band crumpled Bay's tub boosh, the latest best selling paperback by pebble head is a wonderful evocation of those much lamented sappan sorp days. tipping tapping Flim Flam goose crease and lavender and a 10 of Polish for the porch. The light in the tunnels and the flap of the flaps in the flat bury out by the buyer. Those endless bowls of piping hot porridge such with the joys of the SAP and soft days, rights pebble head and If like me, you're an unreconstructed sappan sophist, it all comes flooding back. There was an earlier Book Of course by inspect, and I stand by my review when it first came out in hardback where I wrote this book is shoddy and inadequate and inadequate. It is thoroughly inadequate. In spip had the temerity to write what he called a thorough and adequate account of those sappan socket days, despite being a secret sopan savviest when I revealed this gruesome truth in speb was discredited, and his bones were thrown off a cliff into the churning ocean. Good riddance to him sigh. pebble head, by contrast, has the measure of those sappan soft days. It seems he's listened to contemporary tape recordings of claimants and wardens and tosspot and although his tone is often desperate, when it is not twittering, he nailed it. By it, I mean a very concrete sense of Bane jug band merriment. And the names you would expect are all here. Though I cannot repeat any of them for legal reasons. I don't want my bones to follow in slips of that gaunt and mighty cliff. point that pebble heads pros in his examination of SAP and Sufism is that he chugs along, chug, chug, chug, in a way that's attractive to those who like their pros to have that kind of locomotive crumbling rhythm. Pale poets may skip and proms and paler poets, my gamble cross, Verdun sward, but generally such pale power testers have a whiff of the sopan SAP about them. I do not make that charge lightly. I would say the same where I standing on the beach at dusk surrounded by girls scavenging among the bleached bones of inspect. There are worse ways to end one day. I have loved and been bitter. Sometimes when recalling those satin soft days. The gleaming lanterns, the Flint heart, the barbican's are top the tools. Some come to genuflect and some come to keen and then those are their ways, and I shall not guide and say them. Or if I do, I shall crunch across their own gravel on my hands and knees to prove my point. You will not hear such claims from the inception of this world, this spinning globe this dispensation.

In spirit was it in his mouth when his horrible book came out, and he was betrayed by a clairvoyant. That is how that is often how these things turn out how tangled schemes unravel the clairvoyant was unbridled certainly and mouthy, but that made a welcome change, guttural implications and gargling were her mode of speech, if speech it can be called. And as soon as he heard what was being said about him, the record in spip tried to flee. Typical I may say of those who observe the sopan satis debauchery, for the butcheries they are is fleeing or rather his failed fleeing took him to places human beings are better avoided, such as the wild hills and the fiercest sea front, the most dismal of outcrops, and the tinniest of fairground arcade, tinny, tinea was and tacky and I wash with Tat, and their inspect was cornered. There he was revealed as a pooper, whose cronies vanished, gone, leaving him alone in his poopourri. He knew his book was but page after page of meretricious why Moodle, yet he pressed on writing hundreds and hundreds of pages like a blanket. I have said elsewhere that he never knew the first thing about the SAP and SOP days, not because attempts have not been made in his childhood to bash a few basic ideas in his curly haired head, but because he will fully let all that he did once no evaporate like a type of milk in a tin. It is a mystery why he did so why he allowed the sopan satirist to squish their boggling into him. He was packed so tight with it, he might have burst. The service pedal head does in his new book is fourfold. I think he surprises us with little glimpses of his chugging. He is aware that his readers know more than he does about cows and birds and Stalinism and cashew nuts, and he does not try to overreach himself. He does overreach himself on the Mad clanging of bells in mad bell towers in a mad country, but he does so persuasively and in spades. Then there is is almost grating acknowledgement of those who allowed him to listen to the tape recordings. I confess, I fought back tears and the duct still shed the old drop now and then, as I recollect how fantastic and achievement it was to risk is boned. in circumstances where you are, I would have hidden behind a nest of crate, panting hob hammering thumpa thumpa thumpa thumpa thump. And fourthly, critically, he knows his bales. And he says so without apology without rancor without coming over all twee and Minzy like an inspector would have done had he known a bale from a pile of pins and pencils, or some other sopan savviest vulgarity. What we are left with is something we can all be proud of standing on a bridge in blistering sunlight, watching the sparkling river below us flowing relentlessly to a destination we can never even imagine reaching. Even if night crashes down around our ears 1000 times 1000 thousand times in this land it would be bonkers to disavow. If he's on that bridge I stand I do not think pebble head would recognize me now. And I know for certain that in spirit, if by some miracle his bones leaped up out of the deep and snapped themselves together into human form. And we're enfleshed and quick with life even then in spirit would know me not for I have read the book and it is as if I were truly there fluttering and bright pitched past picture of Granger in those jug band satin SOP days.

So to end this week's show, what better than some further further science by Norman Davis? I need an explain what this is. It's a great little book called further science book 20 by Norman Davis published in 2001. Dogs. One that the fact that see centuries old wood when broken is fresh orange and turns gray in 40 seconds then Black is significant. too, it means that carbon color is air linked anaerobic three, and that although carbonizing process without air contains color as it were, gets behind, it rapidly catches up in air for and it also means that dogs being colorblind and insect not that dog brains are opposite insects etc. fish, birds and man regarding brain oxygen five which points to fundamental opposite division of organic brains into aerobic and anaerobic possibly also explaining colorblindness etc. for dogs we go on the next page we go on to dog psychology.

That's the end of this week's show. Hope you've enjoyed it. You certainly learned a lot about dogs and curbs and the sappan soccer days. I'll be back next week. Bye bye
