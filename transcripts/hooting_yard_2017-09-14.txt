Lesson One or 4.4 FM

Am I on air now? Good evening, and this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting out on the air. Normally you would get the Caucasian lullaby the hooting, yelled Theme Music by Henry cow and flat Pappy from 1975. But you're not getting that this week because we seem to be having a huge problem with what our Belgian friends call Heck, internet. So, no music, and there might not be any music in between me talking, which means I'm going to have to talk for half an hour. But you know, I'm capable of doing that. And so on with the show, this is the umpteenth series of putting out on the air, which has now been running continuously on resonance since 2004. Which my reckoning is 13 and a half years ago, um, anyway, let me let me get on with the show. And here we go. Here we go. I don't know what I'm gonna do when I finished this piece, and we would normally have the music maybe I'll hum. Anyway, let's go. I'm often asked what it was like to be bought. For example, I may be leaning insouciantly against a mantel piece at a switch sophisticated cocktail party, when a fellow guest will approach me sometimes you know, wheelchair and say, I'm told you were bought. I don't suppose you'd care to tell me about that, would you? Or I may be queuing in the post office to buy a postage stamp or to when the person behind me sometimes on crutches. Well tapped me on the shoulder and say, I could tell by looking at the back of your head that you were born. What was it like? Every so often I'm asked in writing usually in a cramped and barely legible hand. I wish I could say that I try to give a full and Frank answer. I wish I could say I responded at least politely. But I don't. My usual tactic is to jibber like unto a monkey, toss my not so golden locks what's left of them and execute a little parallel. I then removed from my blazer, pocket a crucifix, kit it and set it on fire with my Ignite. Oh, fab lighter. As Perkins run through with a rapier so himmelfarb, bewildered in the gloaming. There are things fit only for the ears of those who dwell in Cretan town. Was it browning, who wrote about the bow of cherries some officious fall broke in the orchard. There are no falls in my orchard any longer. I sent them packing one by one from Thursday through to the following Monday. Yes, even on the Lord's day, I shared I chased a fall from my orchard by dint of Bob Wish me Godspeed, and count the circle of toads for bought is bought and shall ever be as never be in weightlessness, and pox. Now this is a bit where normally on the show you would get one thing that the weird thing is, even though I've been doing this show for 13 years, if you asked me to hum the Caucasian lullaby I don't think I could. I can't remember how I can never remember how it goes. It's got the piano and what is it? Some kind of brass instrument, bassoon or clarinet or something, and I can tell how much I know about music anyway. So here's a little drone.

And now we'll continue with the show. In when I was bought, which I just read to you, the narrator tells us that on finding foods in his orchard, he drove them out. This may be true or it may be fiction. It's not entirely he's not an entirely reliable narrator. But either way, it's a clear reference to expulsion of the fools from the orchard mag imagine Oh, a magnificent and majestic oil painting. By the noted oil painter dot oil pain are a those initials after her name are often thought to indicate mistakenly that dot oil paint is a member of the Royal Academy. In fact, they stand for rara office. The artist considers herself to be a rare bird and likes to wear a cardboard beak and a suit of feathers when working. Just as in her case, the letters are a on this interpreted so to her magnificent and majestic oil painting. expulsion of the falls from the orchard depict two fools being expelled from an orchard, one male and one female play are both naked and the female football is holding a piece of fruit from which a trunk has been bitten. Understandably, the subject matter is thought to be biblical. But this is not the case. As dot oil Pyne explained in an interview with misinterpreted oil paintings weekly magazine and I'll quote from that interview now. It is true that I have mined the Bible for inspiration in the past. There are for instance, my oil paintings of the Gadarene swine, the hairy man and the smooth man, everyone drinking the waters of their own system, and the horse saying haha among the trumpets in the book of Job. But expulsion of the food from the orchard has absolutely nothing to do with Adam and Eve being driven out of the garden of Eden. The idea for the painting came from a conversation I had at a swish sophisticated cocktail party. I was not there by invitation, I stumbled into it under the misapprehension that it was a gathering of ornithologist among whom I hoped to garner some tips for finessing my cardboard beacon suit of feathers, which I always wear when painting. By the time I realized that nobody in the room knew the first thing about birds, I had already drunk several cocktails, and I felt a bit woozy worried that I might topple over, I leaned against a mantle piece to steady myself. Also leaning against the mantle piece insouciantly was a fellow who was clearly not an ornithologist, but who nevertheless had the air of a jack door or a budgerigar. We struck up a conversation initially regarding mantel pieces, insouciance cocktail parties, jack doors, budgerigars on the comparative merits of Kathy Kirby and Petula Clark. Then this trap told me about his orchard, and how it had been overrun by fools fooling about in it. Are you saying Petula Clark is a fool. I shouted in outrage. For if there is one thing I cannot bear, it is to hear a word said against Petula Clark. My interlocutor hastened to assure me that we had moved on to a completely separate conversational topic, and that he too held Petula Clark in the highest regard higher perhaps than any other 20th century songstress. with the possible exception of Kathy barbarian. I splattered and spat some of my cocktail into the five place. Pretty sure I yelled, Cathy Burberry and couldn't sing her way out of a paper bag compared to the sainted and glorious Petula Clark. In retrospect, I'm not sure this assertion stands up to scrutiny. But then, nor the most assertions made at cocktail parties after a certain point.

After several minutes of back and forth and further cocktails, it eventually dawned on me that The orchard full of fools was indeed a completely separate conversational topic, and that my umbrage had been this place. This in turn, led to the creative spark setting off fireworks in my head. As I envisage a magnificent and majestic oil painting, entitled misplaced Umbridge I was ready to bid farewell to the non ornithologist, and to rush away to my chalet 10 cure dawn my cardboard beacon suit of feathers and set to work.

But he grabbed my arm and with a wild look in his eyes began gambling about how he had driven the falls from his orchard, carrying not a jot that they were naked, and that one of them had just started snacking on a piece of fruit. so compelling was his tail, that I could not help but listen wrapped, as wrapped as I would listen to a pakula clock platter spinning at 45 RPM on my record player. And as I listened to lineaments of a huge oil painting took form in my mind's eye. Thus was born expulsion of the fools from the orchard. I began to paint it that very night, it took months to complete. I do not wish to boast but I think it's the finest oil painting of fools being expelled from an orchard that I have ever painted in oil paint while wearing a cardboard beak and a suit of feathers, the better to inhabit my desired persona of urara aravis popsy. Pop to use the given name of the Edit tricks of misinterpreted oil paintings weekly who conducted the interview expulsion of the falls from the orchard by dot oil paint are a is currently on show at the stats gallery pointy town as part of the exhibition, cack handed dorbz of oil paints slathered on vast tracts of corrugated cardboard and Crete is free on production of a handful of birdseed and oh, listen to this.

Right so we don't need to do my humming and groaning anymore. We have the music. And there's a very rare photograph on the hooting yard website of 1960s pop duo pa Clotilde performing their chart non topper come into the garden mod on a Belgian television program. Like untold dozens of their contemporaries, pa clo tilde have been shoved nun to gently into the dustbin of pop history. Yet in their prime, the pair could be said to have been the brightest garlands on the pop music wreath. That at least was the verdict of the cultural critic Charles Scholl loopy, who wrote for my money, which are present circumstances is a handful of loose change on a promissory note of dubious provenance. Pr a clo tilde, which for monographs can be translated as pa and Cloete old are the brightest garlands on the pop music wreath. This wreath composed mostly of loopings foxgloves and stinging nettles is a lovely thing. A very lovely thing, a thing so lovely that it takes my breath away. It takes my breath away and also causes a nasty rash on my forehead. That's because I took the opportunity to pop the wreath onto my head when nobody was looking. I wanted to imitate Christ wearing his clothes. crown of thorns, but in a sort of pop context, pop being my field of expertise. Pa proteusds career hit the doldrums after a disastrous appearance in shrubbery nest. Pierre had the flu and claimed to have had the flu too. And the two doses of flu wreaked havoc on their performance of tutti foofy Boogie boo. Charles shod loopy again the shoe barinas crowd, peevish and rancorous to begin with on account of local kiosk closures and an ominous flock of godwits looming above the open air arena grew uglier. Like pelted poor Pierre a clue dealed with pebbles, and gave vent to an ungodly howling, which quickly spread to such rough beasts prowling the undergrowth of wolves and wild pigs. Pigs don't usually how but these wild shrubbery nest pigs were of a different order to your usual pigs, possibly because of their proximity to an experimental research Research Station. But I'm more a pop person than a pig person. So I can't be sure. As the young rascal sang, how can I be sure, I can't. I just can't burst into tears and weeps for 40 days and 49th. In the early 1970s, pa Clotilde attempted to revive their career, they collaborated with antipathy and pop folk sensation, Keith potratz, once of the seekers, but the new trios version of El Pueblo or needle yamasa van sido, released as a single just in time for Christmas 1973, flopped and flopped dismally, and flopped dismally and dissolved orally and flopped dismally, and does all totally and irrevocably, and flopped dismally, and does it orally and irrevocably and floppy as floppy floppy as the fluffiest imaginable flop, which is saying something. What it's saying is that the single flopped and flopped dismally and flop dismally and desalt orally and flopped dismally and desalt orally and irrevocably, and flopped dismally and dissolved orally and irrevocably and sloppily as sloppily as the sloppiest imaginable flop. One could paraphrase, but to do so would not change the fact. So it's best not to paraphrase, and simply to repeat the exact same words for purposes of emphasis, which is what I just did. And where are they now? Pierre? A Cloverfield were indeed. And now indeed to boot. And Pierre indeed. And clo tilde indeed. Or should I say, a close to old Indeed, I should. I did.

Oh, where are the snows of yesteryear? what becomes of the brokenhearted? Why Do Fools Fall in love? Must we fling this filth that up? Pop kids? Not even child child loopy can answer that one.

And after I posted that piece on the hooting yard website, which I remind you is hooting yard dot.org not dot.org I said dot twice accidentally. hooting yd.org I got a letter about pa club tilde and it read as follows. I was from a rock and pop critic Rick rock pop crit. Do Mr. Key he wrote. I was fascinated to read your piece about pa Clotilde. It's true. Sadly, the junos career lay in tatters by the early 1970s. What was missing from your article, however, was any account of Pierre's later involvement in the punk and post punk See, my cousin said punk crit covered this in an article for the monthly magazine punks named Pierre in September 1979. I clipped it out with a pair of extremely shiny scissors, and I'm sending it to you, so you can transcribe it and share it with your listeners by reading it out. So that's what I'll do. This is a sin punk crits article about Pierre exciting news reaches us that Pierre previously of the chart non topping guru Pierre a cloak team is making a comeback. He has completely reinvented himself for the punk and post punk era, fronting a new band called Pierre every time to fool their first single UI a clue to a raucous and god awful discordant didn't have me tapping my toes while wearing my own pan to fold. The beside close to mana more is less of a kotappa and more of a hands over the ears cacophony of kickoff on Audacity. The band is currently in the studio, recording their debut album, devil news yet a sad sad bear die no pop on phone Clotilde. It promises to be a cracker. Glass is a view shared by plastic Bertrand who I bumped into in a corridor on my way to conduct an interview with Pierre. It came as a surprise to me. That plastic Bertrand is not as I thought made of plastic. This revelation so disconcerted me that when I sat down with Pierre, the first thing I said to him was, Pierre, did you know that plastic Bertrand is not made of plastic? We in mustard, before launching into a mournful lament about Cloete accompanied by copious weeping. Unfortunately, it was all in French, or the dialect of French spoken by Walloons, a language with which I am wholly unfamiliar. So I just sat there trying to look sympathetic while puffing on a Gitane. There was no sign of the panting fooled. By the time Pierre eventually shut up and dried his eyes with a dainty and unpunctual like silken handkerchief. I'd got thrown an entire package of tans at her had heard quite enough mawkish. wallonian, blathering, I was trying to work out what to do next. I could slap Pierre about and tell him to get a grip. Or I could try to divert him on to a different subject. Best of all, perhaps, I could sweep imperiously out of the room and pursue plastic Bertrand. Then the door crashed open and a woman swept imperious on the into the room. I thought for a moment, she was some kind of spice hippie, then I realized it was Clotilde

is probably the the final final piece this week. Unfortunately, it's not about either pa or clo tilde, or plastic Bertrand. It's about something entirely different. And it's called the Pauper and the princeling and the P. There is the story about the Pauper who steals a pee from a princeling. Or it may be that the princeling steals a pee from a pauper. I can never quite recall which way round it goes. I gotta remember because God knows I heard the story often enough. My mom or sometimes my power, read it to me every single night for years and years as a bedtime story. Perhaps that's why I don't remember it with blinding clarity, because I was always falling asleep as I listened to it. I fell asleep in spite of the undoubted excitement of the story, and of the Sturm and Drang, of the violent thunderstorms, which were a constant feature of the weather in that place at that time. I suspect my falling asleep came so easily because my mom or my partner, spiked my bedtime milk of magnesia with a powerful tranquilizer. I was certainly a tranquil child. I never said boo to a goose. My parents kept several geese, but I never dared say booed who were single one of them, frankly, like terrified me with their honking and their waddling about and the whiteness of their feathers of whiteness that seemed an earthly. It reminded me of the final scene in the narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe. Of course, I was not reminded of this when I was an unlettered taught. It was only later when I learned to read. First I read childish comics like the Ipsy Dipsy do and the hammer of Christ. But I was a keen reader and swiftly moved on to Enid Blyton and Enid Blyton off and Enid blight at the end of the tunnel, before tackling Burgess and Borchers and the gloomy rations and potboilers by pebble head until a 12. I read the narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. after week, I was so unnerved by that whiteness that I never read anything else ever again, just reading Poe's novel over and over again and again. It remains the only book on my bookshelf with rather obviates the need for the space provided by a shelf. Hence I have filled it with plaster see models of a pauper at a P and a princeling. I made these models myself, visualizing the Pauper and the princeling based on what little I could remember about my childhood bedtime story. And I based A p on close observation of a frozen p, I removed from a packet of frozen peas stored in the freezer compartment of my refrigerator. In my kitchen. In my chalet high in the Alps, near the sanatorium where tubercular patients lie sprawled, exhausted on balconies. Among these patients who I watched through a pair of binoculars, is a fellow with a walrus mustache who closely resembles the lumbering psychopathic serial killer babinski. But it cannot be him. If it were, I'd like to think I would clamber up to his balcony and engage him in conversation and ask him if he too, grew up listening over and over again and again to the tail of the Pauper and the princeling and the P. If he had, and if he was indeed babinski. It would explain a lot about his subsequent career, reining violent havoc and mayhem upon the Wheezy and the blameless and the innocent. When I tire of watching the bubinski look alike, I trade my binoculars upon the snow capped Alpine peaks, white, so white, so an after ugly blindingly white.
