Good evening resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. This is what you're listening to. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air with the final show of 2014 which was took us into our 11th year of hooting Yod. I think it began in No, yeah, because it began in April 2004. So we had our 10th anniversary in April. We're now in our 11th year. See, see whether it be burning coals or sugar lumps. His manipulation of the tongs is peerless. He is a dab hand. The dab to a demersal fish he has plucked from the tank with the tongs with great care to watch it wriggle before allowing it to plop back in while it sinks gracefully to the sandy bottom. Coal, sugar dab. These are but three of his tongue manipulations. He was born to it, his papaya thrust the tongs into his tiny infant fist. Papaya was the Chateau orange tongs man, as his papaya had been before him and his before his all those prepares stretching back generations. Since First, the tongs were forged on the first shattered tongues man's the legendary enville. The first words he could speak were the words of the song of tongues. Six, he was sent out from shattered across the desert to top pooter practice tongs in his satchel. He confronted bears and monkeys and wolves, and human wolves in the form of the roaming top pooter band ditty. He learned the manipulation of the tones. app, dubbed galab taught him further tricks, sweeping movements, significant passes, sleight of hand, delicacy deafness. The Wonder was that app glob the lab was blind. He proud the castle ramparts with it. No, it proud the castle ramparts with it was whispered long, invisible tones. Many of flunky felt their pinch from an inconceivable distance. Even papaya was in order of app galab. It was important to watch the ramblings of the dab with great reserves of concentration to memorize them. They told the weather the crop failures, the outcomes of battles. Not so the manipulation of the tongs with burning colon with sugar lumps. Those were mere humdrum tongue manipulations to avert blazes or to sweeten infusions. That happened that a piece of burning coal might pop from the half onto the carpet if the fire had not been properly set. far better than pluck the coal from the carpet with the tongs than to let it burn and have needed flunkies with pails and buckets to extinguish it. It happened that an infusion might be bitter or sour, and barely possible without the addition of a Sugar Lump better than it be sweetened and poured unwanted down the drain. But the dab the dab, app dubbed collab with the repository of the dad's wriggling law, incapable of seeing the regular things he had them reported to them, not by the shutter age Thomas man whose job was to concentrate on the manipulation of the tongs to have to watch the dab with piercing acuity, the meanwhile, would be asking too much, far too much. Class by his side was the dab rig old man. It was another hereditary post passed from pepata son. As for the dab, there was a pool for them in the castle grounds. By settled there on the sandy bottom being Debbie until such time as the tank dab died and had to be replaced

then The dotnet man came lumbering towards the pond with his neck. He cast it about with great skill to ensure just one dab was caught in its mesh. And then he hurried, hurried through the ground and in the gate and through the hall and up the stairs and along the corridor to the chamber were in the tank rested on its stilt and he plopped the new dab into the water, and it sank to the sandy bottom awaiting, though of course, it did not know it the twice daily and entrance of the shattered tongs man with his tongs. Neither the dab wriggle man nor the dab net man had any doings with burning coals, no sugar lumps, save to be warmed by the fire or refreshed by the sweetened infusions. demarcation lines was stringent in that castle. stringent to at least by name, the stringent tongs. This was the pop group who played in the castle ballroom, and who performed the song of tongs at daybreak at lunchtime at dusk, a basic guitar bass drums trio augmented on spectacular days by glockenspiel and Ponsonby hooter. They were old hands drawn from the village, subject upon entering the castle, to a stringent code of conduct. The code drawn up by AP, dubbed galab, or more correctly by his papayas papaya, papaya, papaya papaya. It might even be that further peppers be added to that literally. generations who have patrolled the ramparts with it was whispered long, invisible tongues. When the stringent tongs returned to the village, on so seldom days, they carry with the moths and spiders and beetles from the castle. They released them on the desolate top pooter and off they flatter and scary, and creepy.

I'm going to have DRAM today. I had no DRAM yesterday, or for several days before that, and I think it's very unlikely that I will have DRAM tomorrow or for the foreseeable future. The precise extent of the foreseeable future is of course, a matter of conjecture. Some people have the attention span of a gnat and can foresee a little more than that in next few seconds. If that. Then there are seers and wizardy. Persons who can foretell or at least claim to foretell events that occur far into the future. Nostradamus is perhaps the most famous example. But there are others, such as those boffins who can cut long range weather forecasts between the netbrain than the series and the weather forecasters are the vast majority the rest of us who can make reasonable guesses at what might occur a few days or even a few weeks. Hence, according to our appointment diaries. I know for instance, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that in a couple of weeks time I will touch would be visiting a hospital to see a consultant to find out what he has learned from a study of a sample of my precious blood. Yes, it remains possible that this will not happen for reasons mundane or rescheduling of the appointment, or dramatic the hospital collapses to ruin and an earth shattering capitalism. So even the foreseeable future may not be wholly foreseeable. of one thing I can be sure and that is the fact that I will have jammed today. I intend to spread it the jam on a slice of toast, possibly two slices of toast depending on the amount of jam and the liberality or miserliness with which I spread it. I might even eke out three toast slices worth. If I go a bit mad. I know I will have the jam today. From where I sit, if I crane my neck at a certain angle and pier intently through my spectacle lenses, I can see the jam in a small plastic container with a tear off lid resting on the countertop. And then the electric toaster in which I shall be toasting the slices of bread. Will Shao the future 10th. Can I really be sure I will have the jam. Could something happen? mundane or dramatic to prevent what might otherwise seem inevitable? With the jam in my possession now, could it yet happen that I will not after all have jammed today? To which the only conceivable answer is Alas, yes. I might discover when tearing off the lid of the container that the jam is contaminated and gives off a foul Reek and must at once be consigned to the dustbin. Or in a variant of the anomalous phenomenon of spontaneous human combustion, there may be an inexplicable occurrence of spontaneous jam combustion, and I will be left with not jam but cinders. All sorts of other event realities that are likely and the unlikely a feasible. The only way I can guarantee having jam today is to see speaking to you right this second and make my toast and spread my jam and eat it. So that's what I shall do. And I will report back.

Mission accomplished, I had granted a Hurrah Hurray. Though it's only fair to say that it tasted far less toothsome than I had hoped it was bland jam. Tomorrow, I hope instead to have marmalade, but it's best not to hope too desperately. For who knows what might occur before the sun rises tomorrow to crush my marmalade desire.

Cracks began to appear in his story immediately. So rapid was there onset that the story itself had not even started, as I've just demonstrated. Not only that, but the story was full of holes. There were more holes than there was story at this stage. If one examined it, the story did not hang together. But it was exceedingly difficult to examine in any detail, because of the cracks and the holes. These are now so Legion that the story itself was barely perceptible. It will be more accurate to say that it was not perceptible at all by any of the senses, even if all five were in working order. It is, I suppose, vaguely possible, but only vaguely that someone blessed with a sixth sense, might be able to perceive the story. But dimly, dimly. There were just far too many cracks and far too many holes, and it simply didn't hang together. How could you hang a hole after all, or a crack even separately, one by one discrete, let alone all together. It would be a very peculiar nail from which you might hang such a vacancy or multiplicity of vacancies. If you were minded to try a nail, rather than a hook or a paperclip, but let us assume for the sake of argument, and for the sake of His immortal soul, that such a nail or hook or paperclip existed, and from it you were able to hang after much effort and sweat and elbow grease, numberless holes and cracks uncountable, would you then be any closer to an appreciation of his story? I would avert that you would not you would be exhausted and still wallowing in ignorance. As it happens, exhaustion and ignorance are my middle names. So I need not bother my little head about his stupid story. I can really collapse panting upon my palate. In a State of Belief

received a letter, hooting yard central from Mr. Christopher lamere. In New England. I noticed that Christopher Mears name is an anagram of HRH elastic Emperor, though that may not be significant. Anyway, let me read you the letter. This is a genuine letter. Dear Mr. Key, I want you to know that you are my favorite writer. This may seem like a vast honor for a no name panelists friendless failure of a 25 year old to bestow, but it's God's truth. The imagery which you conjure gives me chills. The truth you tell with your stories fascinate and disturb me, especially because I often initially read your tales as flights of fancy instead of actual true events. As a resident of New England, your descriptions of far away old England unnerving portraits of a distant land which my home tries to imitate. Imagine my surprise then, while wandering through some not very dense woods, which, as an American, I would never call a spinny I found myself at the edge of a wooden lake. First, I was convinced that the plank upon plank of maple wood was merely the foundation for some as yet unconstructed building. But when I pressed my ear to the varnish surface, I heard that interminable sloshing of some hidden beast, I was shocked to find that your story of the wooden lake was not a May of fantasy, but an ominous story of hidden portend. I should interrupt here to say that there is in fact a hooting out story about a wooden like underneath which looks a vast and squirrelled tree aquatic monster being named dagobert. Anyway, back to Mr. Lanier. It's the most frustrating thing in the world, since it seems like a conspiracy which I was excluded from, even with word whispered between my close friends. When I broach the subject of vast like monsters, or even the mere idea of lakes hidden by wood, their whole demeanor changes. It's as if they've never heard of a like all monsters, or wood, or even nails. While I have not been ejected from my town, as of yet, people tend to narrow their eyes and his outsider. When I come around, what should I do? I don't own a hammer, and there is no duck pond in my town. Yours in fear, Christopher Lemaire. To which I replied, have no fear Mr. lamere. I have given much thought to what you should do in order to avoid otherwise inevitable gruesome consequences. First, make a magnetic tape recording of the hissing sound made by your townsfolk under cover of darkness, subject the tape to certain blasphemous manipulations, then use rusty blood caked garden shears to cut it and form it into a loop such that when played, it will repeat after approximately 13 seconds. Take it to the precise center of the wooden lake and play it through an enormous loudspeaker or electric hooter deafening volume, have to hand the supply of pebbles, which you can hurl at any townsfolk who approach intent on silencing you as the godel for his resounds across the wooden lake and into the dense woods, execute a tableau vivaan of a historical or mythological theme, Judas with the head of holofernes would be apt, or perhaps President Nixon holding his arms aloft, just before boarding the helicopter on the White House lawn that ferried him to retirement from time to time, increase the volume of the hissing tape loop. Before several days have passed. Your lack of a hammer and a duck pond will count For nothing, and as I so often say when dispensing advice, irrespective of the nature of that advice, remember to wear gloves.

In days of yore when I was young, I tried my hand at verse rather than prose. This was not a good idea. I don't have a poet sensibility. Although I confess I'm not entirely sure what that means. I record with fondness, a handful of the verses I wrote, there was one in particular, in which I alleged that I was sitting in a room with massive shutters and had brilliant team in my hair, but not Jews at my memory. 30 years or more have passed since I wrote it. If I recall correctly, I was sitting in a room with massive shutters, and I did have brilliant teen in my hair. But of course my recollections are all askew I barely recovered last week, let alone the early years of the factor administration. It may be that the debauchery is of my wilderness years frazzled certain circuitry in my bonds that would account for my imperfect memory. Yes, I know for sure as Eggs Eggs that there were a few occasions when I slathered my hair in brilliant team. I'm no longer clear why I did so. One such occasion was New Year's Day 1980, which I spent in a holiday cottage on the south coast, owned by the parents, a friend of mine. This friend was a big brained intellectual with an alarmingly high pitched voice, who went on to become a successful television producer of mindless tat. Even at that young age, he did not have enough hair on his head to slather it with brilliant team. He was prematurely bald. But I was not. And I had brilliant in in my hair where their massive shot is in that holiday cottage. I do not remember any better than I've never had much of a mind for architecture. This is a failing akin to my failure as a poet, but I lose no sleep over it. I don't dream of a parallel world in which I roam through buildings spouting expert knowledge on them in rhyming couplets. Perhaps I would be a better person if I did. But I doubt it occurred to me when I was writing this piece that I posted that poem app on the hooting our blog 10 years ago in 2004. I mistakenly attributed it then to Dobson and this is how it goes. This is a kind of 20 year old Mr. Key babbling at you now. There were massive shutters in that room and I had never left it. Ah, I had brilliant in in my hair. There were roses that will lock it. I was lacking something so unnerved. But for my hatred should have seen it. Even eaten it. Got it on our eyelash, crushed it broken it, eat it out of someone's purse or loved it lusted after it. So here's my signifier. You can read it. You can keep it. You're so bloody thick. You don't even know what to do with it. Well, eyebrows hair, my pastorals then breakfast, and I love her. Oh, come on. You must be guessing. Or maybe you're just so fetching. I'm done with fleshing out my line. My hair is in a tangle and I haven't paid the rent. But I had brilliant teen in my hair and yours were better shutters. Dammit, I couldn't even see your rubbish but I had brilliant in in my hair.

Of course that was probably not written by me but by Rick The young ones has that aerobatics, Frank, peevish sounding. I don't know what that was all about, but more about poetry now, because last week was the 100 and 84th birthday on December 10, of Emily, Emily Dickinson and I celebrated her birthday as I always do. And I was reminded of my long abandoned project of concocting an entirely new corpus of work by her through the simple procedure of jumbling up lines from her poems, more or less at random. The thing with Emily Dickinson is that virtually all her poems have exactly the same form. So you can just really, honestly pick lines absolutely at random, and you end up with what sounds like a proper Emily Dickinson poem. And I thought maybe if I revived this scheme, because I'd forgotten about it, but you know, that might keep me occupied during my dotage. So here is an example of a brand new Emily Dickinson poem taken from bits of existing Emily Dickinson poems. This is my Christmas present to you all, always for me and Emily, and it goes like this. Because I could not stop for death. It's a little ether hood, between my curtain and the wall had power to Mangle me. That actually makes more sense. And my poem about shutters and brilliant teen or Rick from the young ones is Pope. Yeah, so that's it for this year. I hope you've enjoyed this year's shows. And I'll be back on I think January the eighth 2015. To review more drivel from the interior of my boss. Bye bye
