Good evening pickers it's hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point 410 4.4 FM coming to you live from the glistening headquarters of resonance FM in London. My name is Frank key. And I have a question. Could it be that the shade of Christopher smart is haunting the corridors of a large and important municipal building in faraway Oregon? This unlikely question is prompted by discovery made by Brett who's a blogger has a blog called think of England and in the course of his valuable research into the official state crustaceans of the USA, Brett on earth house joint resolution 37 from the Oregon Legislative Assembly, adopted in 2009. Now there is nobody called Smart among the representatives and senators who pass the resolution. But it's clear to me at least, that the Mad poet spirit hovered over whomsoever drafted it. Granted it uses whereas rather than Christopher smarts favored, let and for which he uses in Drupal rt agno. But otherwise, this could be a last fragment of that great poem. So here is either a fragment from dribble art a agno, or joint resolution 37 from the Oregon Legislative Assembly. Whereas the Dungeness crab fishery is the most valuable single species fishery in Oregon, making Dungeness crab an important part of Oregon's economy. And whereas the Dungeness crab is an iconic Oregon symbol. And whereas the Dungeness crab is the most delicious of the crab species. And whereas the Dungeness crab annual harvest begins each year on December the first, when Dungeness crabs are hard shelled full of meat and in their prime, and whereas the Dungeness crab harvest ends on August the 14th. To minimize handling so that post molt soft shelled crabs can fill out undisturbed and whereas this management method has served the resource well for decades, and ensures that the Dungeness crab fishery is truly sustainable. Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of the state of Oregon. That the Dungeness crab is the official crustacean of the state of Oregon.

I'm continuing with poetry verse as other kind. Is this. bonkers Maisie in her cart, trundling past the madhouse wall, actually read the intellectual part. by author Raina happens stall. Yes, she has 100 times. It is the only book she owns. She can act it out in mind while juggling several traffic cones. She travels a lot long the rotted line heading for the distance see sprites cavort within her brain. A brain no bigger than a B. dainty is her air and mean. Though her cap is set askew, she is in love with low thar preen. The Maestro he is bonkers to by the sea they shall be weird. Then sail away in a Barkin tine hearts of 10 hearts of lead. They shall yearn and they shall pine for the land Oh pomposity. They have quit, where Mrs. gubbins will sit and knit commemorative tea cozies by the score for preen and Maisie on the shore. Like King Canute upon the beach in the School huge seabirds screech the carts abandoned it will rot. There's a moral lesson there. Is there not

Dobsons a short essay upon cardboard breakfast cereal packets, leads the reader not unreasonably to expect an essay upon the subject of cardboard breakfast cereal packets. It is nothing of the sort. Such a topic was it need hardly be said grist to the pamphlet is mill for nothing cardboard was alien to him. But we should recall that he had already dealt with cardboard breakfast cereal packet exhaustively in his pamphlet, nothing cardboard is alien to me out of print, as well as in several other works. A short essay upon cardboard breakfast cereal packet is in fact, a handwritten and unpublished screed scratched out by Dobson with a butcher's pencil upon cut or torn sheets of cardboard, once forming parts of breakfast cereal packet composed during a paper shortage. The historical evidence for this paper shortage is slight even non existent, and it may be that it occurred only inside the pamphlet his head. He is known to have imagined crises of various kinds, such as outbreaks of ergot poisoning, bird attacks, planetary collisions and thunderstorms, none of which actually took place, but fantastic details of which he scribbled down in his journals alongside the mundane and the tiresome marigold to suggested Dobson did this to make his life see more exciting, and to provide any future biographers with opportunities for hysteria heightened prose. If that's the case, it must be said that an invented paper shortage is hardly the stuff of high drama. Towel haired young Dobson is Ted Kak has suggested that the pamphleteer simply ran out of paper one day and could not be bothered to fetch a fresh supply from the Stationers. Whether he's recalls a bit of cardboard was genuinely necessary or otherwise. The short essay is an intriguing piece of work, truthfully because it remained in manuscript and was never typeset and turned into a pamphlet proper. Dobson perhaps felt it was too short, although other times he happily issued for publication in pamphlet form some remarkably brief works, not the least of which was the famous and much anthologized paragraph about potatoes. For many of us our introduction to the Titanic pamphleteer Ted cacs view expanded in an incoherent and shouty way during his hour upon the fourth plinth when he took part in gormless gormless ludicrous pageant of inanity in Trafalgar Square, is that Dobson plans to incorporate the short essay on altered and in its entirety into a longer piece, a study of the behavior of toads in the Soviet Union, which despite voluminous notes, a research trip to onsc and the purchase of a third cap with air flats he never actually completed. It is difficult to know what to make of young Ted cacs argument for the word Toad behavior, Soviet and union and know were present in a short essay upon cardboard breakfast cereal packets, were and to what purpose we're entitled to ask, did the out of print print pamphleteer intend to insert this fragment of prose barely 60 words long into a piece which the excellent draft tells us was single mindedly concentrated with laser beam precision upon communist BuffOne die. An additional curiosity about the short essay is that the cardboard treats were at some point coated with a kind of disgusting yet transparent paste, which makes them resistant to all known photocopying techniques. Now there's a thing Further reading a very long essay about Stalinist toads written with a magic marker upon hundreds of cream crackers by Dobson out of print

many odds and ends this week is another free piece. It was suggested to me by a suburban shaman that I should display upon my person as part of my rig. The plumage of who pose that this had not previously occurred to me was no doubt due to a distinct lack of shamanic advice in my life up to that point, I would go so far as to say that I had actively poo pooed manifestations of the mystic, whether in the form of shaman, wizard magicians, or the blind sear whose tent was erected by the side of a mountain path which passed by my chalet. It was through this fear that I was put in touch with a fellow who kept a flock of who pose in an iron cage, and who let me pluck their feathers in return for a small consideration. Once I had the sack of feathers safely home, I took great pains attaching them to my cardigan. I used cow gum and safety pins, and by the time I was done, scarcely a glimpse of wall was visible beneath the hupo plumage, I donned the cardigan and awaited enlightenment. The shaman had not been specific with regard to the esoteric hullabaloo I would experience so I did not know what to expect. I stood in my kitchenette, and boil the kettle and made a cup of tea, all the while concentrating my mental energies upon any perceptible changes of insight into the spiritual realms. These realms were, of course, the ones of which until now I had doubted the very existence. I sat on my stool to drink my cup of tea, it tasted the same as usual. Just as the feel of the store was no different to any of the thousands of times I had sat upon it in the past, I began to think that the suburban shaman had taken me for a fool. Then, having drained my cup, I went out along the mountain path and down into the village. It was the day of the goose market, which draws crowds from the hinterland. Now I began to understand the significance of the hupo feathered cardigan, for all eyes were upon me wide and bright, staring in surprise. A slight yet persistent mountain breeze ruffled the plumage, so that as one witness was later to put it, my torso appeared to be mystically vibrating, while my head and my limbs remained still. And still, I was four I took up a position in the village square between the goose pens and the cement statue of Ringo Starr and I stood there for hours for days so that the villages and the visitors from outlying parts were transfixed by my presence, their eyes gaping, their mouth hanging open, their goose business forgotten,

was useful to catch up with the doings of tiny Enid. And so that's what I'm gonna do now. One blustery and bitter springtime morning, tiny Enid decided to make a goodly supply of bathtub gin. The plucky talk was wholly ignorant about the distillation of spirits and liquors. But she was a resourceful girl, and Sophie clumped with great determination along the street, past the duck pond and the hazardous waste facility to her local library. Now, it may surprise some younger listeners. But in those days of tiny Enid tiny drum libraries were filled with books and had not yet become chat and snack zones for diverse and vibrant hoody team persons. So the heroic infant was able to Jen up on all she needed to know about the making of bathtub grin by consulting a selection of large and impressive volumes in the reference section. Having crammed her sparkling brain with information, tiny Enid picked up all the things you would need if you made her way home, taking a different route, which took her past the Badger sanctuary and the moonshine supplies Emporium. With her usual excessive if not deranged, zeal, tiny Enid set to work and soon had a bathtub full of gin. This she did canted into a Jerry built VAT and proceeded with a second bathtub full. Only when the VAT was filled to the brim with rotgut gin did tiny Enid relax sitting down in her favorite armchair smoking cheroot and listening to gramophone records, records of Xavi a coup gat and his orchestra. While at the library tiny Enid had taken the opportunity to borrow an instructive book by Gabby TAs entitled large scale sabotage of civic plumbing infrastructure. She speed read this while gobbling down her supper of jagged hair and bloater paste sandwiches, so that before bedtime, she was able to pipe her vat of bathtub gin into the local water supply. by the afternoon of the following day, tiny Enid was pleased to note that the whole town was a scene of moral degradation and unparalleled debauch. A Hogarth print come to life. She checked that her VAT was now empty, readjusted the piping system back to normal, plunked a clock hat on her head, and went out into the teeming streets to set the world to rights. Many, many years later, when she wrote her memoirs, tiny Enid explained, it can be difficult to imagine the frustrations of a brave adventurous tot such as I was growing up in a peaceable indeed an idyllic little town bid. Those who have read Lark rise to candleford by Flora Thompson, or watch the television adaptation may have some idea how few opportunities I was granted to perform acts of heroic derring do when everybody was basically quite well behaved and knew their place. I much preferred situations of chaos and abandonment, in which I was able to assert my fascist super tiny persona. The poisoning of the town's water supply with bathtub gin, was one of my more successful provocations. And while some might have used it to preach and hand out temperance tracks, I had a good deal of thumb, kicking people in the head and shouting my head off until they all sobered up. After that, they began to realize who they were dealing with. They even struck a medal for me to commemorate the way in which I dragged the town back from the brink of moral collapse. My oh my she was a proper caution, that tiny Enid

I was doing some research the other day and oddly, I was unable to find a Wikipedia entry for the botsman.org because there without question the most important dots of the past 100 years. They are of course auditing themselves. botsman always referred to them as his old dots, leaving it to the wider world to dub them with his name. botsman was by no means a modest man, but he had his moment of diffidence, and the act of dot nomenclature was one of them. botsman is thought to have named the dots after dot tinned blue stocking sister of the noted mezzotint is Rex tinned in a particularly hectic 20th century year botsman and dot had a fling, and it was when they were holed up in a love nest in one of Ruskin's favorite Swiss villages that botsman one snowbound winfree weekend first conceived of the dots that will bring him fame. It's possible of course, the dots are not mentioned by the Wikipedia for security reasons. After all, it's their military applications that have changed the world. These were not foreseen by botsman, who is on record as stating that initially at least he considered the dots of most benefits to gardening and food Asked potters and hikers. It may have been dot tent herself, who, recognizing the dots of versatility, sent a sketch of them to a bigwig at a top secret intelligence facility. In interviews later in life, she denied having done so, and it's perhaps one for the historians to Winkle out now that blockman dot tent, and indeed the military bigwig are all doornail dead, and I've long since fed the worms in their respective burial grounds.

In bunker's Maisie, which I read, earlier in this show, I mentioned the intellectual part by Rainer heppenstall. And I'd like to quote from him now from his first novel the blaze of noon, published in 1939. Well, this this goes without explanation. It is the sublime in consequence of a thumb that I like the confusion of noises, the sense of unreality that is given as a great and heavenly gift to human beings who live among starving moaning cattle and tumbling milk cans, and hens screeching underfoot, and who, no matter how they try can never coerce their lives into routine, but must always wait on the weather and market prices and the temperamental vagaries of this stock, and at one time spent idle weeks in the rain, and that's another toil both day and night, and yet another time wasted precious hours, chasing a cow which has got into the wrong field and which in running away impales itself eventually on the railings, or in segregating cocked chickens of three weeks old who suddenly discover their sex and in one afternoon, reduce each other to bleeding wisps of town. That is what I like about a farm.

disembark from the ship of fools, and I stepped aboard the Veldt Schmitt tag that would carried me to shore. The woes of the world Weigh Down the tugboat captain, who would not or could not hide his disgust. I was his only passenger and as he stared towards the island of pomposity, he spewed forth a litany of misery piling one curdled complaint upon another until I had to stop my ears with caulks. The C sloshed and smelled of rotting aquatic death. I could see the land. It was close enough that I could make out various pumpers Ladies and gentlemen, promenading upon the harbor wall in fustian and crinoline and tweed. But hours passed, and the Veldt Schmidt tog never seem to get any nearer the shore. Though the engine was chugging away, belching foul black plumes of smoke poisoning the seabirds was it stuck forever between foolishness and pomposity, trapped aboard a tugboat with a world weary Captain moaning and spitting and cursing, corks in my ears and bile rising in my throat. Yes, I was, and this I would learn was very heaven.

I'd like to end this week's show with three types of Incy Wincy. Those listeners with tiny children and babes in arms and little infants may wish to memorize these three types of Incy Wincy and use them in the nursery or at home. baby's bedtime. Very effective, all three of them I think Incy Wincy bajra scribbling in the dirt, put some sticks together and built himself a yogurt. He's a new age badger. His name is little Curt. Careful now his feelings are very easily hurt Incy Wincy lobster cracking in the sea, his brains completely alien to that of you and me Incy Wincy lobster much bigger than a be the lobsters very strange and is never, ever tweet Incy Wincy goat boy creature of two realms, we can see you darting in between the elms. Half of you is human, the other half the goat Incy Wincy goat boy, drowning in a moat.

I'm actually shooting out on the air for this week. Don't forget to go to the website at WD anything you need the three W's I think you can just go to hooting yard. One word.org. Go there. There's books to buy for books to buy. You can take out a subscription details of subscriptions. Or you can just make a donation. You know, that will be nice. And I will repeat my point that if everyone who listens to this on a podcast sends me one pound or $1 I'd actually be quite rich because I was astonished at the number of people who listened to the podcast. So do that there's a PayPal thing on the website, just send me a tiny amount of money and if all of you did, I'd be laughing but if you don't, nevermind, I will still continue to appear each week and add stuff to the website all the time. And that's the end of this week's show. I'm now babbling incoherently bye bye
