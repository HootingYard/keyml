Good evening and this is hooting out on the air with me Frank key for our first show of 2010. Before going on with that, though, there's a couple of post Christmas things I need to deal with. During the latter part of December the end of the year, the post he was struggling along the line towards hemoglobin towers, heaving a sack filled not, I'm afraid to say with seasonal greetings cards, but with tear stained letters from listeners, lazy writers and those have a hackneyed bent, a fond of describing tears as copious, I thought I had the full measure of that word until post he tipped out the daily sack of correspondence by God. Every single envelope was drenched, drenched with the salty servings of ungovernable anguish. I had to make use of a sponge and a mop before I could open them and read the scribbled Lamentations there in the cause of all this misery. Is that this this year mean? Well, last year, I failed to record a hooting yard Christmas special. A year ago if you recall resonance broadcast my reading of Sylvia Townsend Warner's selection from the natural history of Selborne by Gilbert white, detailing the activities of Timothy's have taught us and the year before that I was given a whopping three hours of airtime to recite with germander speedwell Christopher smarts poem, Drew bollati agno, a reading which proved to be an historic piece of radio. I last come last year's festive season that just gone. I simply couldn't rely upon a suitable text. I pondered reading bits from a wizard the garland of mawkish Pap, by prudence foxglove, but somehow it seemed to withered and to mawkish. I was tempted by the idea of broadcasting to have Richard Nixon's six crises, but was unable to choose among them. For a while I even considered devoting a program to the latest sorry outpourings of beatnik poet Dennis beer pint, but neither I nor resonance could face the prospect of the inevitable legal proceedings. So with some regret, I threw in the towel, which was a pity because I could have used it to more effectively soak up the tiers contained in post these sacks, the sponge and the mop only did half the job. Anyway, all I can do is to apologize. And anyone who's still really wants to listen to a Christmas special from hooting yard, should go to the Wikipedia page for Drupal rt agno. Scroll down and there at the foot of the page, you'll find a link to the reading that I did with germander speedwell preserved forever on the interweb. And I recommend listening to it in its entirety at top volume every day. Oh and I do have some exciting news to add to that. After untold years in preparation, dribble out i agno. The motion picture is due to be screened at your local multiplex sometime in February or March, directed by Mel Gibson, starring Christopher Plummer. And using old footage of Valentine dial and Basil Rathbone. This epic production has already won plaudits from my favorite film critic, the grunting and snaggletooth peasant with a rusty spade who stands mysteriously under an elm tree at the edge of the cemetery spitting crows

and there was another to do around Christmas time occasioned by the the card I sent out to listeners and subscribers to the website and those kind of people kind of cc list of people who get credit indications from me. And I don't need to describe the car because it's described well enough in the in the letter I received from Moni listener Tim thurn his letter begins pleasantly enough. Dear Mr. Key, thank you so much for sending me Christmas greetings in the form of a black and white photograph of some old bells. If I'm not mistaken, they look very much like the bells removed from the Tower of st Wolfram's church in Grantham, Lincolnshire in 1946 47, and subsequently recast in Lovebird. Okay, so far, so good, but Tim then starts in on his complaint. Though I like the photograph very much. I cannot say the same for the caption you have added to it. never send to ask for whom the jingle bell tolls. It tolls for thee, is of course a doctored quotation from john Dan's meditation number 17. Non kolento sonnet to decode Murray Eris from the devotions upon emergent occasions, you have inserted the word jingle, presumably in a harebrained attempt to lend a Christmasy air to what is in fact a more somber sentiment that might be excused, or even chuckle that mildly? Well, you're not doing violence to share sense. The point is Mr. Key, while the bell was shown may well have told when in their tower they would never jingle for they're not drinkable bells. Even if we strip away the picture and consider the caption in isolation. It remains nonsensical for a jingle bell, by definition does not call it jingles. That's the point of it. A jingle bell is similar, if not identical to a sleigh Bell, as deployed in legend by Santa and in fact, by the Russians, who for reasons of their own, attached such bells to their slaves, as they hurtled across the freezing desolate steps bent upon some mission authorized by the Tsar in the old days. Other inhabitants of cold climes, like thins and laps would also go a jingling cross the snowy wastes from time to time, none of them not the Russians, nor the fins, nor the laps, would ever think the way down their slaves with a big tolling bell for to do so would be insane. Might I suggest either that you amend your Christmas greeting, or withdraw it entirely and replace it with something less stupid, passionately yours, Tim. And Tim in and further email, provided a list of what he considered suitable subjects, including Robin's puddings, or a Victorian paterfamilias plating a bobble upon a 33. He is, of course quite right about jingling and tolling, and I really ought to have thought more carefully before messing about with the quotation from Dr. Dan. But for crying out loud, Tim has nothing better to do.

This next piece begins with a quotation from Raymond Roussel and it should be fairly clear where the quotation ends and the rest of the text begins. It might take a long time, but my fame will out shine that Victor Hugo on the Polian Wagner died 25 years too soon to know his day of glory. I hope to live long enough to see mine. There lies within me a latent glory of immense force, like that of a shell which has yet to burst. The light of this glory will fall upon all my works without exception, it will illuminate every action of my life. People will avidly dig up information about my childhood and marvel at the way I played prisoners base. Some people are predestined. Then, as the poet says, One feels the brand on one's brow, the star one bears resplendent. I shall never forget it. Mainly dry with sunny or clear periods and very cold. A few light snow showers are possible, especially across eastern part Any accumulations of snow will be small. On the whole tonight will be dry and frosty. And then a dab and then a dab burn the pastel amminadab starting with a widespread frost and ice on untreated surfaces, most places will have a very cold and dry day with sunny spells, but isolated light wintry showers may arrive. Here comes Jimmy lickspittle see him far away. See Jimmy lickspittle fallen in the gutter. Another dry but cold day is expected with some sunny spells especially during the afternoon. Like northwest winds. The pier the shear is the pier the greater in Fort Troon, the lesser in fortune, the connecting door the pier, the pier, the blaze of noon. Another dry but cold day is expected with some sunny spells developing during the afternoon, like northwest winds, isolated light snow showers will arrive. Each night sharp overnight frost will occur. I know indeed that all around me is wonderful. A dark veil with the foolish words nature of things upon it. Cast deadening folds between me and their dazzling strangeness. Flowers open and stars rise, and it seems to me they could have done no less. The middle of next week and into next weekend will continue very cold with widespread frost. The frost will be severe in places and perhaps extreme in some rural spots. Patchy freezing fog is also likely to form which will be slow to clear and may linger all day in a few parts. The mystery of distant mountain blue only makes me reflect that the earth is in necessity mountainous, the sea wave breaks at my feet, and I do not see how it should have remained unbroken. But one object there is still which I never passed without the renewed wonder of childhood, and that is the bow of a boat. Many Western southern parts were mainly dry with some good sunny spells. Although occasional sleet or snow showers are also possible. more frequent and heavier snow showers are likely in the north and east, where further significant snowfall is likely. The further outlook will continue cold with further widespread frost. However, it will probably not be as cold as the previous week with perhaps fewer wintry showers. The stars will turn in their courses, the planets will spin Jimmy lickspittle will lie in the gutter by the pier at the harbor in Britain.

One of the books I read over the Christmas period was Cobra the dread by Martin Amos. It's his book about Starling basically. Anyway, I learned two very interesting things from this book. Two things in particular, one was this and it's a quotation. Hitler's father, somehow very appropriately, was more and more obsessed as he grew older by beekeeping. I didn't know that I didn't know Hitler's father was a dedicated beekeeper. Anyway, another thing I learned from the book was that Starling for a time back this theories of the link of the linguist Nikolai yakovlevich, ma 1865. To 1934. One of Mars more amusing beliefs was that all words derive ultimately from the root sounds, Rosh Sol, Berg, and yawn linguistische, who held otherwise I miss tells us would jailed or shot Dobson came across Mars work at some point, and as a result produced what must be by any measure his most preposterous essay in the FA Cup Final of 1962, as it might have been reported by one of our troglodyte ancestors, the out of print pamphlet here channel's the caveman mindset as he sees it, and construct a 44 page text of belaboring inanity and mercifully mercifully brief extract will suffice. But sauerberg young young young rock birds Sal bird young rock, bird, bird, sound rock, rock, rock, young, young South rock berthoud bird young Sal young bird rock, rock, Berber, Berber, rock, young, South. And so it goes on for 44 pages and accountably. This drivel scooped up no fewer than five prizes during 1963 in 1964, including the prix de brochure anchor yob, and the pearl car and Teddy Johnson glistening golden metal for pamphlets out of print within days of publication.

Blodgett was weighed in the balance and found wanting, but for what did he want. One thing he most definitely lacked was animal magnetism, or let us be quite frank, any kind of magnetism whatsoever. Over the years, he had consulted a number of specialists in the field, they tapped his big rectangular block of a head with their little metallic tools, and they fastened operators to his extremities with clips and wires. They even submerged him in vats filled with a mysterious cloudy solution of supplying him with a breathing tube, so he could remain there for hours on end while they conducted their tests. When weeks or months later, Blodgett received their reports in the post. It was with a certain resignation that he read standing at the window, looking at occasionally at the relentless drizzle their conclusions. Time after time, he had it drummed into him that he lacked magnetism. And time after time, he would fling the letters aside or scrunch them up, or even set fire to them with his dragon breath, and picture himself into some distracting activity. He was a master of many trades, including carpentry and millenary, and tattooing, and eel nurture. If particularly fraught, he would busy himself by combining his skills, for example, by tattooing a design of a wooden hat upon an eel or by tattooing a design of an eel upon a wooden hat. I met him one morning, crossing sawdust bridge. Shortly after one such episode, he was wearing an eel emblazoned wooden hat and beckoning a dog. His way of beckoning was to move his arms in slow, delicate gestures as talks to him by a magnetic theorist. But the dog was repelled rather than attracted, and it scampered off into a field to snuffle myths to clump and be borage. Poor Blodgett wept. I handed him a napkin to wipe away his tears. I did not tell him it was my magnetic napkin, in which a tiny tiny iron load was embedded. I stopped off home to my magnet and cackled as I threw the switch on the Balaji Tomita

on Fiverr, we the poet, Dennis bid Ponte recently received a commission from p i, g. Pig to write a Ballade in celebration of the election of its new president. Oh, pig. For those of you wallowing in ignorance stands for the porridge information group a school, a body devoted to promoting the sale and consumption of porridge in every corner of the land. Since he became a beatnik beer pints, Muse has deserted him, and he's written nothing except for frag mentary squibs. He accepted the commission partly because of the generous fee and partly in the hope that his versifying gifts might be reborn. Alas, he spent many hours sat staring hopelessly out of the window. With an empty brain. Finally, in desperation, he cast around in anthologies for something which if he could not quite pass off as his own, he could tinker with or use as a model. As luck would have it, he discovered George hosford 1802 poem, the scum uppermost. When the middle sex porridge pot boils over, an erotic election ballad with explanatory notes, accompanied with an admonitory nod to a blind horse. He was a works that fitted the bill perfectly, featuring not only porridge and elections, but horses and scum. And as I speak, bear pint is mucking about with the text to turn it into something he can call his own. George hosford incidentally had a way with titles among his other published pieces being bubble and squeak a gallon now free of British beef with the Trump cabbage of Gallic philosophy 1799 as for pig, it is held by some of the members, but the proper title of Timothy Mose 1991 novel, the redundancy of courage should in fact be the consistency of porridge. Though this is thought to be a comment on its pro style.

A couple of things to end with both actually quotations from Raina happens store books you can read about right now happens stall on the hooting yard website. Anyway, the first one is really him paraphrasing Boswell The dream is Boswell Of course who wrote the life of Dr. Johnson. Anyway, this is the James Boswell approach to getting up in the morning. On Thursday morning, he awoke heavy confused and splenetic. On Friday, he remembered a friend's prescription that on a rising he should cut two or three brisk capers around the room, which he did and found attended with most agreeable effect. It expelled the phlegm from his heart gave his blood a free circulation and his spirit of brisk flow so that he was all at once made happy. He resolved to persist in the exercise. So in these snow bound times, when you wake up in the morning, anything, you don't want to get out of bed. Get up, cut three brisk capers around the room and you'll feel much better. The other quotation is from happen stalls book for absentees, which is part autobiography part memoir of other people. But it gave me an idea of how this year I might vary hooting out on the air by using the white technique. I haven't started training yet. And you're probably wondering what the white technique is what I'm about to tell you. Overhead there would sound a curious wailing from father burns room. When I first heard this sharp cry breakout on Monday morning, I had suppose that Father Bernard was either having a fit or whipping himself. Eric Gill, however, had quickly reassured me It appeared that Father Bernards vocal cords were not all they might be, and that he was studying a new method of voice production invented by a man called White in which the vocal cords were dispensed with all together, and the notes produced by expansion and contraction of the sinuses. This did not seem to me possible. Well, I'm going to start attempting to make noise by the expansion and contraction of my sinuses starting tomorrow morning, after I've cut three brisk capers around the room, and you'll find out if I've been successful next week. Bye bye
