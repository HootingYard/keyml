Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. The New World Order has come to pass. It has been decreed by the king that From this day forth, the order of world should not be w o r RL d as at present, but, O w l r d. When a space is introduced between the L and the R, we get our read where read is a common abbreviation for road. Thus the New World Order is to be found along our road, which is to be the new name for every single road street Ave Crescent news lane path you get the idea throughout the kingdom. The usual moaning minis have raised objections, chiefly the posties and dustbin men and others whose duties require them to navigate the various roads and streets. They are at least their representatives say that with every road call our road, they will get lost, lost, hopelessly lost and be unable to perform their functions with jus efficiency. To which the king says Pat that's one of the great things about being the king. You can wave your big gloved hand disdainfully and say, a nun they're challenging. The posties and dustbin men's representatives made it a little facet true. But once the king and glared at them and spat his contempt, they knew better than to persist. They returned to their dead bones, like whip cars, and held meetings where they tell the posties in the dustbin men to get to work starting on our road. Don't worry, your little proletarian heads about becoming hopelessly lost. They were told for how can you be lost when wherever you are, you know, you are on our road. You say you have a king looks after his subject. In the New World Order. Everybody knows exactly where they are at every hour of the day in the night. And that is a very fun state of affairs, indeed. written this day, sitting on a municipal bench on our road.

That's the New World Order as of now. And I thought I'd continue with some more extract from the top of Steph Thompson motif index of folk literature, which I've been reading bits off over the last couple of weeks. And we're going to deal with magic and more specifically transformation. So this is d, zero, to D 699. And once again, even though that is 699 or indeed 700 entries. There's far far fewer than that I'm not sure why that is. I don't know what happens to the numbers that I don't read out. But nevermind. Magic transformation. d 113. warewolf. d 251.

Two little points that I think worth bringing to your notice now. When Margaret Thatcher died last year, I devoted one of my posts to Jews on the dabbler website where I write a column every week to the unresolved question of which bird she most closely resembled. I noted that Matthew Parris claimed she walked like a partridge while Jon Snow of Channel Four news asserted she scuffled about like a hen. Now, things have become even more complicated. I've been reading Dominic Sandbrook seasons in the sun, the battle for Britain 1974 to 1979. You may recall last week I mentioned the fantastic story of Jeremy Thorpe's 1974 hovercraft based election campaign around seaside resorts. That was from that book. Anyway, another thing I learned in this book is that far from walking like a partridge or scuffling about like a hen The Daily Express compared Margaret factor to an angry Woodpecker. So which is it? Is it a partridge, a hen or a woodpecker, or perhaps tree was a combination of all three. And the other thing I wanted to mention is also in fact, from the dabbler but a post, not by me, I posted your bat called john Murray spear and the electric Messiah. And I'm just gonna read you a very brief paragraph from it. It's the kind of paragraph that I don't know if you read it or you hear it and you want to know more, and I do feel I need to do further research on this. The new motive power was constructed of copper, zinc, and magnets, all carefully machined, as well at the dining room table. At the end of nine months, spear and an unnamed woman also referred to as Mary of the new dispensation. ritualistically birthed the contraption in an attempt to give it life unfold unfortunately for spear this failed to have the desired effect and the machine was later dismantled.

Usually when I repeat things on this show it's through forgetfulness, or desperation if I haven't written anything new, but this week I'd like to repeat something that I wrote I read out last week due to having received a request to reread it so that's what I'm going to do so if you if you were bored with it last week you'll be bored with it this week but I make no apologies because I'm fulfilling my my listenership requests, which I always do.

some of that sounded a bit more like the IKEA catalog. I wouldn't want a self boiling kettle or a self returning robe or both. You know, very good anyway. Onwards experience tells us that most cranks hype their bump about in carrier bags. Any crank bump will be peculiar to his own in a fixed whether it be UFOs the second coming of Christ, the grassy knoll, or one of any number of tomfoolery. But no matter what the precise nature of the mania, the crank almost invariably, stuffs is bumped into a carrier bag before setting out into the world. Having so set out he makes his way to his preferred spot. This might be for example, at the foot of a statue in an important square. There will be many passes by weather permitting, each and every one of whom there's a potential convert to the crank calls. Bouncing bag, he may either rent through a loud hailer or more quietly buttonhole individuals by thrusting a sample of his bum fat them as they pass. The bump usually consists of a bundle of getestet nerd screed of wildly improbable pros, which the crank will be willing to give away gratis. The carrier bag will contain numerous copies often dog eared and crumbled. Most days the crank will return home with almost as many in his bag as when he set out. What does he do the crank were not at his spot. He scrubbed A new and more thorough screed sitting at his kitchen table. Each day he gains new insights in tears in a world find fresh evidence for his theory and he committed to paper. The best type of crank will have in his bump several different screens, all of course devoted to the same subject. It will be noted that very few cranks as a veer from that chosen topic. A Loch Ness Monster crank is oblivious to the concerns of a Lindbergh baby kidnapping crank. But it's also worth noting that with the substitution of a small number of nouns, the screeds in their bump can be almost identical. It is generally impossible to become an ex crank. The most a crank can hope for is that his mad ideas gain acceptance by the wider world. Then he is no longer a crank, but a prophet or a visionary in the future. In recognition, a statue of him may be cast and placed on a plinth and an important square. At the foot of the statue, a new crank will take his place with a carrier bag of new bumps, and the gleam of certainty in his wild eyes.

The following is an extract from a book by Trevor Hall called The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney published 50 years ago. nonfiction book Edmund Gurney with a founder member of the Society for Psychical Research, and there's absolutely nothing about him in this extract. On the 24th of December 1892, George Albert Smith announced in the Brighton and Hove Herald that he had taken a lease of the scent and well pleasure gardens. By April 18 93, Smith had been able to supplement the many natural attractions of St. Anne's well, by the addition, among other things, of a monkey house, a gypsy fortune teller swings, and Cecil was for the children, and by popular lectures and demonstrations by himself. In my 1894, Smith announced that some ads well had become one of the most popular amusement resort in Britain. He claimed that close to 3000 visitors had tight threatens for admission on Monday. The attractions now included captive baboons, and exhibition of dissolving views by means of long range Limelight operators, and cuddling and trapeze artists. Smith advertisement in the Brighton and Hove Herald and the Brighton Gazette on the seventh and ninth of June 1894, announced a balloon ascent and thrilling parachute descent by Neil Campbell, Australia's demon of the air on the following Saturday, augmented by trapeze juggling and balancing act. The demon of the sky It was said were performed his wonderful leap from the sky from a height of one mile by means of a parachute. We may perhaps think that a mile was an exaggeration. However, in the event, Smith created more of a sensation with his demon of the air that he could have anticipated. Half of Brighton apparently was wild with excitement, because during the ascent of the hot air balloon, the demon had been unable to free himself to make his spectacular parachute descent. After drifting over the town, the balloon with the demons still attached, crashed into Brighton cemetery, the demon it was stated broker tombstone by the force of his descent, but was miraculously uninjured. And now let's leap forward 60 years when the National Film theatre was opened on London Southbank in 1957, the British Film Academy invited the now 93 year old George Albert Smith as a guest. He was presented to Princess Margaret met Gina lollobrigida, and other stars of the film world and was given a picture of the theater by Lord Hailsham.

fascinating character George Albert Smith, the as you know, from the way that ended by the time he was 93. He was considered one of the, if not the father of British cinema, he invented many of the techniques used in cinema. But early in his career, he was a rapscallion and rogue who, who did lots of shows with hypnotism and convinced the people of the, of the Psychical Research Society that he was psychic. Anyway, some more interesting little snippets of biography now from my forthcoming book, which will be published in November, so you've got plenty of time to wait but obviously, you'll be buying several copies as your Christmas gift to all and sundry. The book is called Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives, and will be available as I say from the sixth of November. In the very brief time we have left his here are three very brief biographies standout French writer real name Mary Henri bale 1783 to 1842. Standard stand up believe that an efficacious cure for the pangs of love was to eat lots of peas. Robert Louis Stevenson Scottish writer 1850 to 1894 Stevenson died while making mayonnaise. His wife found him collapsed from a probable cerebral hemorrhage on the kitchen floor of their home in Samoa. Jan struga, English writer real named Joyce and screw the 1901 to 1953 the creator of wartime housewife harrowing, Mrs. miniver once had a terrible road journey in France, during which the car became stuck in mud in bad visibility. She was shouted at by an angry farmer while stuck behind pigs obstructed by a fallen tree athwart the road. And one of the tires suffered a puncture. She wrote, our delay was due to bog fog frog haugan log, and if only I could make out that the puncture was due to a loose cog, my happiness would be complete. And that's about it. For this week out, you know, I'm gonna quickly add Norman Tebbit, English politician born 1931. In 2010, tablet prompted the glorious headline Norman Tebbit attack child in Dragon outfit. The story below explained somewhat disappointingly, that he was so upset by the noise caused by a Chinese New Year celebration near his home that he ran 100 yards down the street, grabbed a drum that someone was banging, and planted a kick on the backside of a dancing dragon without realizing a boy was inside. That is a bit of a letdown. I think because Norman Tebbit attack child in Dragon outfit is probably one of the great headlines and on that with that mental picture in your mind, that's the end of this week's show. My name is Frank key and the producer was Johnny seven. Bye bye
