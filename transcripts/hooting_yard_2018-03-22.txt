Okay, here we are. Here we go. The first sentence and Abbas were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Neil. Everything else in between was not. Two boys were sitting on the harbour wall playing with dice. One of the boys was clever, and the other boy was dim. Now when I tell you that one of the boys tossed the dice into the sea that sloshed against the harbor wall, you're likely to conclude the boy who so tossed was the dim one. Dice serve no purpose in the sea, by will Bob upon the surface of the waters uselessly, carried by the tide growing ever more distance the one from the other, sopping wet and no longer to be played with. But in fact, it was the clever boy who ruined their play by tossing the dice into the sea. For not only was he astoundingly clever, with an intellect far out with the usual range of boyish bright brains, but he was also a psychopath. No sooner had he tossed the dice into the sea. Then he shoved his dim playmate off for harbor wall into the same sloshing sea. And for good measure. He grabbed hold of a passing harbor kitten and death to it to mewling tract it into the water alongside the dice and the dem boy, the name of this clever boy, young babinski amused by his seaside enormities the youthful psychopath toddled off toward milkbar with not a care in the world. Meanwhile, in the vast wet, merciless sea, the dice bobbed, but the dim boy and the harbor kitten sank like stones, and the waters washed over them, and they were forgotten. My husband made forward 30 no 40 years. 40 is a better number than 30 According to blockman, who famously assigned an abstruse yet comparing non numerical values to certain numbers that took his fancy, for example, eight and 11 and 15 and 16, and 19, and 26, and 29, and 37, and 40. And Oh, for God's sake, shut up with this list of numbers, it could go on ad infinitum. Suffice to say 40 is one of botsman so called Basilisk numbers, whatever that might mean. In the 40 years since the clever boy and the dem boy sat on my harbor wall playing with dice, the wall has crumbled. The big waxy is reclaiming the land. Half of the town is now underwater, including the milk bar where all those years ago babinski drank a tumbler of warm sour goatee milk and travel that is useful crimes. And now he has returned. Look there he is silhouetted against the ghastly sky, swinging his axe. Standing on the town's highest hill and gazing perplexed at the sea below. He has come on a pilgrimage of salt. Eager to revisit the scenes, it directors he remembers them of his youth, but they are gone sank beneath the waves are surely as his first victims is dim playmate and the harbor kitten vanished forever. babinski was not a Manta letter, little thing like the sea confound him, pausing only to waylay a passing Punch and Judy man, butchering him with his axe and slices. The lumbering walrus mustache psychopath lumbered off towards the khanduri, where he rented a deep sea diving outfit, complete with gleaming brass helmet. Then he walked into the sea, following the old familiar roads and paths and knees and alleys submerged under the churning waters until he came to the milk bar. Its door had long ago fallen from it, rusted hinges babinski entered and sat at the common old table, where we're on tiny crabs scuttled and lobsters cracked memories tumbled through his insane head. He could almost taste the goatee milk of 40 years ago. And then from behind the milk bar counter

there appeared as see Wraith festooned in seaweed. It was accompanied by a seagulls kitten. The kitten were a necklace of eel grass, on which was strong a pair of dice. The reef sat down opposite they've been ski, but ghoulish kitten jumped up onto the table, and chased away the crabs and lobsters Hello babinski dugald the race for once. The Walrus mustache psychopath was nonplussed. Yes, it is me your childhood playmate. Poor little gracchus you shoved me on off the old harbour wall into the patellas Sea and traveled tittles. And sorry, I'll start again. Yes, it is me your childhood playmate por dem gracchus you shoved me off the old harbor wall into the pitiless sea and trapped turtles the kitten named after me. I thank you for that. He has been a boon if kittenish companion these past 40 years. We both ground of course. But our bodies were never recovered. When we sank to the bottom of the sea. We were dragged into a cave by an old man with a long beard who carried a trident. He nursed us back to what passes for health among sea rice and seagull until we were well enough to attend his series of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations about undersea life. Labor a real eye opener. I can tell you, even someone as dim as me or as stupid as the kitten. We learned so much. For example, do you have any idea how easy it is to hunt down and kill such tiny fishes dabs and sprats and blennies classes how I make my living or rather racing these days, I roam the seas in my little ship, with tittles as first mate casting my net and catching tiny fish, which I sell to the other denizens of the deep. There are all sorts of down here, drowned sailors suicides, nitwits, who never learn to swim. You should think about coming to join us bubinski There must have been times lying awake in your blood drenched bed when it crossed your mind that you should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent sees. Not that it's silent down here. Oh no. Apart from the shrill piping screams of slaughter dabs and sprats and blennies. There is the continuing reverberation of autumn, played by the house band on the Titanic as documented by Gavin bryars in his 1975 recording the sinking of the Titanic released on Brian he knows obscure Records label. Plus there are all sorts of weird bubbly gurgling noises. Anyway bubinski mild MCE, give it some thought, I think you'll like it here. My ship has no rudder and this is driven by the wind that blows in the The most regions of death

I'm here is another story again where the first and last sentences were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Moore. and everything in between was not. There are currently 17 such stories on the hooting out website at hooting yd.org to which I recommend a visit and they're all marked as such so you know which stories they are and there will be more to come. This one is called children on a country road. I had the wagons Robin when I heard the wagons rumbling past the garden fence. Sometimes I even saw them through gently swaying gaps in the foliage. I would gaze transfixed as wagon off the wagon off the wagon path. But when they were gone, and the road was empty, I saw through gently swaying gaps in the foliage beyond the road, the expanse of the vast wild, windswept desolate top pooter and I was terrified, and I ran back into the cottage gibbering until Paul gave me a bowl of soup on slurping it without a spoon. I was becalmed from infancy Why is Papa had forbidden me to stray beyond the garden fence and foliage. There were countless tales of unsuspecting children wandering onto the top pooter and vanishing in its vast, wild, windswept desolate expanse, never to be seen again in this world. But glimpses of it I had when once the wagons and rumble past frightened me beyond words. Though I was confined to our cottage in its garden, I was a contented taught. I had innumerable pebbles and sticks to play with, and sometimes a bird or ran or a godwit would appear in the sky overhead, and swoop and alight upon the bird table. I would walk in trance does power came charging out of the cottage uncanny speed, a sock filled with wet impacted sand in his fist, and bashed out the brains of the bird before it had time to flit away. On the days when that happened, the soup was particularly slurred about my psychiatrist has asked me repeatedly if I was a lonely child. In response, I insist that I was not never having had any playmates. I had no sense of their absence from my life. All I knew of other children, were the terrible tails of them getting lost on the vast wild, windswept desolate top pooter. Then one day, when I was seven or eight years old, something extraordinary happened. I was in the cottage rumpus room, happily playing a game of put the pebble next to the stick. When I heard the sound of rumbling, I dashed out to the garden and through gently swaying gaps in the foliage. I saw the wagons passed by wagon off the wagon off the wagon. When eventually the last wagon rolled past, I was astonished to see on the other side of the road, coming towards me from the vast wild, windswept, desolate pooter a parcel of children, tiny tots seven in all. Could these be some of the vanished children returning curiously and aged. After years of hopeless wandering? I was a gogue I scampered indoors to tell papar thinking I had come to report a rain or a godwit on the bird table. He was already filling his sock with wet impacted sand. I explained what I had seen. Perhaps I could be my playmates, I added but papaya was cautious. We went outside to look at the children through gently swaying gaps in the foliage. They had stopped when they came to the road and did not cross. They stood there, the seven of them gazing up cottage. I shall call a lollipop lady said papar. When she arrives and helps these mysterious children to cross the road, I will keep them on the other side of the garden fence and interrogate them through the gently swaying gaps in the foliage. You can never be too careful. carry on playing with your pebble and stick until the lollipop lady gets here.

By mid afternoon, the children had been safely escorted across the road. Park let me sit on a stump in the garden while he questioned them through the gently swaying gaps in the foliage. Who are you mysterious? tinies asked papa. The largest child replied for all of them. We are pips he said. Or rather, we will one day become pips. I am Morales, whose name is Bubba. And this he pointed to he taught in turn, is William and Brenda and Elena and Edward and Langston. The little squirt at the end is Chris, who's peppiness will be late and brief. pips are uncomprehending Popol as in Gladys Knight and ver said Maryland whose name was Baba PAPR new little of soul music and even less about Motown and nor did I but we took Bubba's story at face value. And what brings you from the vast wild windswept desert tar pooter to my door as far as you can see, we are but tots said Bubba and our lungs and windpipes have not yet developed fully whereby we might accompany Gladys Knight on her chart toppers. We would like to avail ourselves of the rumpus room in your cottage to use as a rehearsal space. So we can sing our little hearts out until we are equally as proficient as can be. We are confident that Gladys Knight will come calling for us when at different times we are ready to be her pips. propels ferocious countenance hit a heart as soppy as an old sock not yet filled with wet impacted sand. He unlatched the garden gate, and the future pips entered one by one Baba their head, and the little squirt Chris bringing up the rear. They went straight to the rumpus room, and started to sing, though I have to say that at this innocent stage in their careers, as pips, the racket they made is better described as ungodly caterwauling. papapapa I cried over the den. You did not ask them what they were doing on the vast wild windswept desert tar pooter black and white said papar now be on the lookout for a rain or a godwit. Otherwise, our soup tonight will be a thin consomme a. And so I waited. I waited for years. papar never asked the pimps to explain where they had been and what they had been doing before they came to us that day. And nor did I neither of us ever got the opportunity to ask. We could never get a word in edgewise. The seven children sang continually morning noon and night without seeth. We've prayed for Gladys Knight to turn up. We prayed for Gladys Knight to turn up and whisk at least some of them away. I spent entire days gazing through the gently swaying gaps in the foliage, barely noticing the wagons rumbling past trying somehow to summon Gladys Knight. But the vast wild windswept desert top Kuta remained obstinately empty, and vast and wild and windswept and desolate. With nary a sign of a soul singer. Gladys Knight never came for her pips. On my 12th birthday, papaya papaya and I was sat in the ante room of the rumpus room, cotton wool stuffed into our ears to muffle the awful singing. papar looked haunted and woebegone. I asked him what was the matter? a horrible truth has dawned on me sofonisba he shouted. What is that, Papa, I shouted back. I do not think these children are pips, not pips. Then what are they? I think they are fools. He shouted foolish tots who cannot stop singing Yes, I have wondered about that. I shouted. I have wondered that they sing all day every day and all night every night and never seem to sleep or even to get tired. Popol raised his eyes to the heavens. He looked as desolate as the top Buta. He said How could food get tired?

I think there's time for one more of these stories once again first sentence. last sentence translated from the German by Willa and Edwin mill. Everything in between not this is called the bucket Ryder. Cole spent the bucket empty, the shovel useless the stove breathing out cold, the room freezing the trees outside the window rigid, covered with Ryan, the sky or silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it. As I did foolishly, I shoved open the door of the chalet and stepped out and stared at the sky. Aim wha ha mwah shouted. There was no answer. I went back inside and slammed the door shut. Before I froze to death. I put on two coats made from the firm of critically endangered medium sized mammals, which I had stolen from Yoko Ono. Physically, I'm a good deal bigger than diminutive Yoko, hence the two coats. Ideally, I would have pilfered three, but the Beatle Lennon was mooching about the place, and I had to act fast. That was a long time ago. In those days, I did not shout at the sky in French. That skill or art, I learned more recently from botsman. Those seeking Sokka from the sky he writes book 19 lavender series are well advised to note that the sky speaks French with a smattering of Finnish verbs only. I know there are those who damn blockman is a crank and an idiot. But to date, I have found him in an infallible guide. In spite of the often senseless Tashi pedals. I say to date, because now even I am beginning to have doubt. It was after all, because of blockman book nine lilac series that I ended up here in a chalet high high in the ice mountains with an empty cold bucket and icicles forming on my moustache. Should I have created the invitation with a measure of caution? Probably. But immersed as I was in the tenant expounding in book nine. I did not even question it. Instead, I shoved a few essentials into a Pipi bag and ran sprinted to the railway station. I was in such a hurry that I did not even lock the door behind me. Within hours, I was at the foot of the ice mountains, queuing for a ticket for the funicular railway, which would take me to this confounded ice good freezing cold the chalet. The invitation came from the pointy town Nisbett spotting society, an organization previously unknown to me. Dear Sham Beco it read. Please join us for a very special week of Nisbett spotting high high in the ice mountains, Be our guest in our lovely chalet heated by a cold stove. burger. It's chilly out there. So wrap up warm. As I say, it might have been wise to make a few inquiries before rushing off and leaving behind everything I held dear. Not only had I never heard of the point he found this bit spotting society. I had no idea what a nice bit was, How then could I spot one. And if I did spot one, or dozens or hundreds, I would not realize I had done so not knowing what one was dashing off to the shop. I was the utmost foolishness on my part. The rest the best I can say in my defense is that I assumed a representative of the society would be there to enlighten me. But when I arrived, the chalet was empty. There was a small amount of coal in the bucket. So I got the stove burning heated up a pan of milk slops, and sat gazing At the Ryman crusted window, and I waited. I waited for three days until what Cole was almost spent. Then, with a sudden crash, the door burst open, and a woman festooned with the pelts of various hairy mammals came waltzing in. I was astonished to see pointy town's most notorious flapper floss evens through album z. She raised one big mittened fist and cried Death to the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people. Flossie had once been a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army. I'd still like to shout their slogan in greeting thanks since Spivak UI here

I babbled the bucket of cold is almost spent, there are very few milk slops left and According to the Daily ice mountains News Digest and weather forecast dropped by parachute to the chalet each morning. It's going to be twice as cold tomorrow, thrice as cold The day after, and so on exponentially. Flossie seemed unperturbed, and asked me how the Nisbet spotting was going. Somewhat shamefacedly, I explained that I did not know what a nice bit was. Well, nor the way exactly, she said. That's one reason for this very special week. We're hoping that you might accomplish the very first authenticated spotting of a Nisbett that would really give the society a boost. I came to tell you that I've just had word there could be a bit higher up the ice mountains. Apparently, they don't thrive except right near the summit, where the air is thin, and the cold is bitter or bitter. Good luck, Curio. And Flossie wants it out of the chalet. as suddenly as she had come. That was three days ago. Now the coal is spent, the bucket is empty, the shovel is useless, the stove is breathing out cold, etc, etc. The sky offered no sucker, but I have devised a plan. The bucket is large enough for me to squat inside it just about I drag it outside and using knots both sturdy and ingenious. Attach it to the cords of one of the morning parachutes lying in the snow. Then I climb into the bucket. Soon as I expected a flock of winged things with beaks and feathers, probably birds, grasped the parachute in their talents and lifted the knots hold, I am lifted to in my bucket. Let us go and spot on this bit I cry. And with that, I ascend into the regions of the mountains, and I'm the last forever.

So that was three stories for you. The first and last sentence of each one was written by Franz Kafka. and everything in between was written by me with bearing not much relation to the original stories. However, this is my 2018 project. I plan to rewrite all of Kefka stories, or at least gutted versions of them just with the same beginnings and endings. And as I say there are so far 17 of these on the hooting yard website. And I'll be reading them all to you on the radio in the coming weeks. And that's the end of this week's show. do go to the website and buy some paperback books. Or just send me a donation that would be very nice. Bye bye.
