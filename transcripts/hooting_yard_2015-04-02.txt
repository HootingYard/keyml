Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com is six o'clock on Thursday evening if you're listening live and this is that means it's hooting out on the air with me Frank key. when push comes to shove, I invariably topple over. If I'm standing on a precipice or at the edge of a gaping pit, this can be life threatening. Last whenever my plans for the day include roaming in the vicinity of a yawning chasm, I take precautions by wearing a sort of winch and probably a fair, one end of witches wound around my torso under my vest, and the other end of wet dry hammer into a patch of firm ground using a great big iron malade. I'm careful to ensure that this end of my winch and pulley is stuck fast in the earth, for if there is any chance of it working itself loose, the entire activity would be pointless. For if heaven forbid, it were to I was a topple when shoved. My efforts would have been vain for the crumbling or squelchy soil would yield that my winch and pulley and I would surely topple, as if I had never been attached to anything in the first place. That is such a terrible prospect that I make efforts to map out in advance the terrain in which I plan to wander, perhaps a week or so ahead. Of course, fugitive weather conditions can alter the state of the ground as shown on my charts, but risk and chance play a role in all human affairs. And there's no reason why my roamings should be exempt. When setting out on my mapmaking expeditions, I usually attach one end of the winch and pulley to some stable object like a horse trough, or a concrete sundial. My benefactors have long sought to determine me from straying near pits, chasms and abandoned mineshaft. So I'm afraid I have had to use subterfuge as I wave to them from the garden gate with the winch and pulley conceal behind the muffler. I say something like, I'm just going out to check the concrete sundial or my my the day is so Clement, that I think I will stroll along a flat and featureless plane, like the big field where farmer abuse and used to grow his potatoes all those years ago. Sometimes such announcements will be met with questions, which I'm usually able to anticipate by peering at the pharaoh adness of my benefactors browse. At other times, I may have to improvise a convincing response or deflect the queries by pointing at a Starling for example, or forcing a sudden spray of projectile vomiting. when push comes to shove, pointing at a Starling is my preferred option. It's 20 years now since I bashed in pharma be Zions head with his own space. I'd like to think that my benefactors trust me these days, but it seems not. Oh look, there's a Starling in that sycamore tree.

While shepherds watch their flocks at night on punkten Hill, the wind blew wild and they were shimmering. So ghostly gleans one Shepherd had a wristwatch and told the times of the other two. Down below parked and hail on the main arterial road. Huge container lorry thundered past on their way to the ferry. The shepherds smoked the pipe the lorries to belch smoke, for there were no laws in place to stop them. So doing normal their speed limit, crashes and pile ups and terrible accidents were common at that time in that place. Hello pumpkin Hill. When they heard or saw denly in the black night a grievous traffic accident, the shepherds laughed for their hearts were cold and void of human sympathy. They preferred the company of nocturnal sheep wide awake and terrified. A sheep are for most of their time on earth and on punkten Hill. So slowly, the hands of the wristwatch talk off the minutes and the hours. The shepherds are waiting for a sign. There is no signage on the main arterial road safer and occasional arrow pointing towards the ferry. No sign points the way back. But none of the huge speeding lorries ever comes back. They carry the contents of the country load by load to the ferry, and never returned past punkten Hill atop which the shepherds smoke and laugh and are fiercely protective of their terrified sheep. Glory be for Yes, it is a kind of glory up there above the road as the wind blows wild in the night on punkten Hill.

Wrap Up warm because it's cold outside. Well, it would be Wouldn't it this being the Ice Age, there have been other ages stone and iron for example, and bronze, but this one we have dubbed the ice age because it's so chilly. Sitting here next to my oil stove, wearing various furry animal pelts. It is easy to forget just how cold it is outside. I can't see through the windows because they're all frosted up. But I suppose if I turned down the volume on the cassette player, I would be able to hear the howling winds of the blizzard of the blizzard. And they would serve to remind me of the cold. But I would rather listen to the cassette playing pop tones, quite frankly, I'm not in the right mood for howling the wind house and so do wolves. Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish to distinguish one kind of howling from another. Wolves seem to thrive in the chilly chilly weather of this ice age. They have furry coats, of course, or at least hairy, bristly coats own natural as it were to obtain my furry pals. I have to slaughter apt creatures, or at least pay someone to do so for me to slaughter and skin and stick. I am somewhat weedy and short sighted and I would much rather huddled by the oil stove listening to pop tones than be out there in the cold hunting and stalking. In any case, I do not have a pair of snowshoes so I wouldn't get very far. Within a few feet of my door. I expect I would be up to my waist in snow and helpless and I would have to make puny cries in the hope that a tough wolf hunter would come to my rescue. At least you know where you are with Wolves. Those rampaging wild boars are another matter entirely. blindly. I've been woken from a nap by the sound of them battering their tusks against the walls of my heart. I'm pretty sure it there's a wild boar covered in hoarfrost that queued through the wiring of my radio said, I thought the wiring was safe submerged under snow stretching out across the top pooter but those bores are relentless. Now I can only get some of the channels and none of the music ones, which is why I rely on the cassette player. I saved music is pretty grim, all told. But when the alternative is the howling of wind and wolves and the bashing of bore tasks against the walls, you have to take what you can get, and it's not all bad. I grew quite fond of chaps toes icicle Symphony, for example. But the tape was ruined when I left it too close to the oil stove and it partly melted. So now Unlike do with pop tones, I see pop tones with lots of synthesizer at top volume. It drowns out the howling. I used to have a pair of snowshoes. Of course I did, for how else would I have been able to cross the top pooter and make it to my heart. It took me six weeks to get here. plodding slowly. I meant to hang on to them for emergencies, but the fiber they were made from was highly flammable. And one evening the oil stove spat out a stray spark which ignited them. I acted quickly, putting on a pair of mittens, And tracking the burning snowshoes out of the door into a snowdrift. If I hadn't, the whole heart would have burned down and I'd have been a gunner. But it means that now I have to rely on passing the wolf hunters for certain essentials. They can be a difficult lot. I got so fed up with the rampaging wild boars, battering their tusks against the walls that I thought I'd fashion some kind of bought trap. I asked one of the wolf hunters for help. In return for soup. I hoped he would dig a pit outside a few feet away from the door into which the balls might topple and having toppled perish. The rascal ate my soup that said he was a wolf only hunter and couldn't be distracted in his career. by digging a pit for bores. He was huge and violent. So I didn't argue I may no longer have the icicle Symphony to listen to, but I have plenty of icicles. They hang from the ceiling in their hundreds. And occasionally I pluck one off to suck all the users and little spear.

Frank Key  11:47
Sometimes I will use the same article for both spearing and sucking, turn and turn about until my sacking has made it useless for spearing. The icicles are a bit too big to use as pins. And funnily enough, I have discovered I have absolutely no need of pins here in my heart. I've got along quite well without a single pin. That surprised me. But there it is. Apart from the fiendish cold. The reason I don't go out much is fear. Call me namby pamby but I'm terrified of the twin perils of snow blindness and bloco. The wolves and the rampaging wild boars I think I could handle using a combination of mesmerism and gibberish. But neither of these is of much use where the ruination of one's eyes and one's mind is at stake. I've noticed that the wolf hunters all seem to be equipped with very nasty sunglasses, which presumably protect them against snow blindness. Whether they have something similar to guard their brains, I do not know. They're not a talkative lot. Oh, they'll gobble down the soup you profit them. But that's as far as it goes. On one of the radio stations, I'm still able to pick up I heard the other day that the Ice Age might be coming to an end. Some pundit in the studio was Wittering on about all the snow melting across the top hooter. For as far as the eye could see, revealing a buried landscape of VISTA of salt flats. It sounded to me as if his vision was a little different from the snow bound the land of the Ice Age. But I suppose if it does get warmer, I might go out from time to time, though I'm not sure to what purpose I don't put salt in my soup. Never have.

There is a big giant building and at the top of the building, there is an attic and in the attic of stacks and wooden crates, and in one of the crates. wrapped up in the yellowing newspaper, there is a talisman of great significance. The Taliban in this case takes the form of a pewter dog. Neither the puter nor the simulacrum of a dog is itself significant, nor the combination of the of the two. There is a sense in which the terrorist man might as well be a plasticine shrug off the talismanic property of the pewter dog in his in its significance, not in its physical form. That form is in any case ephemeral for everything crumbles everything on Earth. Eventually, the earth itself will crumble. We are speaking of unimaginable stretches of time, the consecutive lifespans of millions and billions. Oh, uncountable gnats. The puter dog in the crate has a terrible power. It has been forgotten, wrapped up and stored away in a crate among other crates in an attic in a big dam building now abandoned and eek slated for demolition. So says the sign tied with a tough plastic tags to repost outside the building. The word condemned is prominent in big bold Black Bloc capitals. bulldozers will be appearing any day now. grumbling along the street first thing in the morning in the midst. But who should come clumping along the street this moment on a windy afternoon? Why is tiny he made the plucky tot with the clubfoot in her polka dot dress has heard tell of the pewter dog. Do not ask cow for there are mysteries within mysteries where the doings of tiny Enid are concerned. Actually clumps along the street. She is swinging a crowbar. She's going to break into the big dam building and rummage through it two rooms until she finds the talent man. Also coming along the street from the opposite direction is a copper. Constable globule is an old fashioned copper with a bristly mustache, and I'm an avuncular manner, he is also a man suffused with a terrible righteousness. He is a preacher in a small and peculiar religious sect, for whom a vast swathes of human behavior is sinful and unforgiveable. Breaking into an empty big damp building with a crowbar, for example, concerns the Perth perpetrator to eternal hellfire. Tiny Enid does not believe in hell, nor does she believe in heaven. It's difficult to say what she does believe in other than her own heroics, and perhaps one or two tenets of fascist ideology. We could say then that the imminent meeting of tiny Enid and constable globule, both approaching the big dam building from opposite directions is equivalent to the meeting of an immovable object and an irresistible force, which represents which is not a question we're qualified to answer. Before they meet, however, there is a moment of congruence when if we were to draw imaginary lines between tiny Enid and constable globule and the puter dog towers man in the crate, they would form an equilateral triangle. how long your hats for this will prove to be a decisive moment in the history of the world. Where the triangle to be drawn between tiny Enid unconfortable globule and any other object, any other object whatsoever. We would not be bounding about such a dramatic claim. But the talisman remember, is significant. Even if we're not sure where in its significance realize. All we know at this stage is that somehow, its significance is connected in some unfathomable yet decisive manner with both tiny Enid and constable globule. Interestingly, neither the plucky top nor the copper are aware of any of this. Tiny Enid thoughts are bent on breaking and entering. With the aid of a shiny new crowbar. Constable globules brain is filled with prayer, a silent prayer, one beloved of his sect. He is also on the alert for any signs of wrongdoing.

Frank Key  19:11
Now, watch as the top and the copper move inexorably towards the points on the street, where they will make up an equilateral triangle with the pewter dog in the crate in the attic of the big dam building. Do not cover your eyes. Do not plug your ears with cotton wall. Be not afraid, for there is nothing to fear. The decisive moment is fast approaching. There will be wonders. But tiny Enid has taken a tumble. She has a clubfoot to remember, and sometimes totters for example, if the paving slabs of a pathway have not settled flat due to shoddy workmanship by pay vias and constable grabill has spotted a misdemeanor. An urgent has disappeared. added a toffee apple wrapper on the street. The copper swerves off his allotted course, to cross the street to apprehend the urgyen and give him a ticking off. Then he will march into a litter bin and have him dispose of his wrapper lawfully. But now, the triangle will never be formed, the future of the world will take a different course. Tiny Enid winded from her tumble and her crowbar having fallen down a drain decides to return home. Constable globule having ticked off the kid goes to take off further genes. And far, far away in the jungle, the mighty jungle. The lion sleeps tonight.

Pick a bomb suggested Gertrude Stein in tender buttons 1914 so that's exactly what I did. I picked a bomb. The barn I picked was the airy barn at the screwin hunahpu farm yard. It was an appropriate choice. Just as tender buttons has been hailed as a masterpiece of Cubist prose. So there is something decidedly Cubist about the eerie barn, which reveals if not its secrets, then to some extent it Irina's when viewed simultaneously from different angles. how one might go about viewing and in Jupiter, but the solid three dimensional bomb from different angles simultaneously, is the point that is moot. It is well to bear this mooted in mind. The Erie Barnett screwed hunahpu farmyard has been the same scene of many, many enormities some involving the lumbering walrus mustache psychopaths babinski, some involving buttons, and some both babinski and buttons. The barn has also witnessed day in, day out the slaughter of an unconscionable number of farmyard animals, not least chickens. One of the buttons on bubinski. his overcoat, incidentally had a decorative bit of folly role, depicting a vanbrugh chicken, but only one of the buttons. Why the overcoat bought an odd button is again the point that is moot. That makes two points of mooting. Having picked my barn I was not sure what to do next, so I further consulted Gertrude Stein, who clearly knew about such matters. Pick a bomb a whole bomb she wrote, and bend more slender axence than has ever been necessary shine in the darkness necessarily. So I did that bend and shine, bend and shine, turn and turn about in the hole airy bound. It was cavernous. When I felt I had Benton Shawn sufficient unto the day, or rather the evening for it was evening. I had an overwhelming sense of mooted good I sent to the Phantom presence of bubinski is great Harry hands drenched with blood is one odd chicken button. gleaming and unnecessary darkness. I did not. And that was a small mercy. Having picked in Benton, Shawn and reassured myself that bubinski was nowhere in the vicinity. I was at something of a loose end. Then I remembered that Gertrude Stein liked to write while out in the countryside, sitting on a camping stall looking at cows. I reasoned rightly. I think that weather is a barn there will be cows or at least one cow. All I need to do was to arm myself with a notepad and pencil and camping stall. Then find a cow Why? Various moody Jews began to dissolve like liver salts in cold water. Gertrude Stein was driven to her countryside cow observation and writing spots by Alice B Toklas. But without car or driver, I had to trudge through farm yard and field and puzzle after puzzle after puzzle in search of my wantings Do you have any idea how difficult it can be to find a notepad and a pencil and it can be stored in a rustic backwater? These things are not just lying about waiting to be gathered gratefully to the bosom of the scavenger. As night fell black and inhuman I was still wondering about like a nincompoop without pencil or Notepad or camping stall. Nor did I encounter a single cow in my writings. Perhaps they had all been done to death in the airy barn at screwed hunahpu farm yard. Before I tumbled into a ditch to spend a night of unrest and terror, I found floating in a puzzle a button. I clutched it tenderly, but then I noticed that it bought a decorative bit of folly role depicting a vanbrugh kickin, was it the button of bubinski that the themed might be close at hand, hunting desperately for his old button might be sick with fear.

I flung the baton away from me as far as it could be flung and toppled into my ditch. Tomorrow, I would pick a different barn, less airy, less Cubist, and far, far from this occurrence spot. And that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it, and I will be back next week. Bye bye
