Good evening This is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. on last week's show, I read a story about starving for me gravy as a sort of birthday tribute to David Bowie. And, sadly, I now have to read another story in tribute to him for much sadder reasons anyway, so that's what I'll do. This was written about three years ago, I think. There is a fictional character named somewhat foolishly Ziggy Stardust, the creation of a one time student of mine named David Bowie. Among the attributes of Mr. Stardust will tell him that he is a like a leper Messiah. I wondered if there was a real non fictional leper Messiah Mr. Bowie had in mind or given he uses the indefinite rather than the definite article, whether they might actually be several such from the size, languishing in leper colonies across the globe. One way to find out would be to make a tour of leper colonies, where they still exist in countries including India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, Vietnam and Japan. Before planning such an arduous itinerary, I did some background reading on this to Bali, and I discovered that he had often expressed an interest in the last nine of those nations, Japan, somewhere he spoke of being under Japanese influence, and elsewhere have pictures of grap girls in synthesis. I also learned that he had once been buried up to his neck when pretending to be an inmate of a second world war, Japanese prisoner of war camp. These clues were enough for me to dismiss any thought of traveling to India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, or Vietnam. And to focus all my attention on the Land of the Rising Sun. It seemed fairly clear that if there were indeed one or more leper messiahs, they were almost certainly to be found in a Japanese leper colony. impatient to proceed with my quest, I jumped into a Japanese car and told the driver to take me to the airport. Instead, he drove me to a forest in the Japanese car and left a hole in the back of my head hiding in the foliage and Pete, it was wet and I was losing my body heat. Mr. Bowie spoke of his honor being at stake when he was under Japanese influence. But for me, it was more a case of injured pride or nearly. And to make matters worse, I was nowhere near Japan, nowhere near even the airport. What price now my important research into Japanese lepen the size anyway, stumbling through the foliage, I came upon some picnickers, along with their hamper, and roghan, folding chairs and cans of wasp repellent by had a cassette deck. It was playing pop tones. I cocked an ear and listened carefully, hoping it might be one of Mr. Bowie songs about Mr. stardust. But alas, it was not. Good afternoon, I said to the picnickers or rather shouted to make myself heard above the din of pop tones. This is something of a long shot, but I don't suppose you will hail from a nearby leper colony. Actually, we do said one munching on a sausage. I was both pleased and surprised to notice that he was of decidedly oriental appearance. Indeed, in spite of the rain, he was wearing a kimono. May I join your picnic? I asked. I'm famished. Wait a moment, he said we will have to ask permission. From whom? I asked. He pointed towards the tent which had been erected some yards away to the east. Our almighty lord and master dwells within that tent. He said, We must seek His guidance in all things including Whether you might join us in our picnicking he swallowed another chunk of sausage.

Oh still my beating heart could it be that I had somehow located the leper Messiah picnicking in the British countryside. My I come into the tent with you I asked. I'm afraid not said the Japanese picnic for leper. But you may wait at the 10th flap. So I did and quite against protocol, I took the opportunity to peek inside. And I was astounded by what I saw. The letter Messiah was not Japanese. After all. There in the gloom of the tent I saw dressed in Scarlet and gray sitting beside a Telly with his tiny hands on his tummy. chuckling away. I leprous laughing No.

That piece also, of course, includes references to another Titanic figure of modern pop music. Let's hope he stays saying he stays well. And labor pictures of drap girls in synthesis in that piece and it's one of those phrases that seems to turn up in in hooting yards stories quite often. For example, mag Strudwick magic Strudwick, where Gallus thou on going to the barn for to milk me a cow, mag Strudwick, magic Strudwick. What will he do? Then? I'll read the high end trails of a fresh slaughtered hen.

Not well the coordinates of the rubbish dump lit lantern handheld visibility, Stygian pebbles underfoot. Buck color snug at the neck distant in comprehensible keening the mighty pyramids of ancient Egypt. Sat is cavort in the forest, a galumphing peasant with a pile. The rubbish dump would appear to be not far from the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Crows fly there on the hour, timetabled, clack, clack, clack, rapid clacks that kind of timetable rain on the pebbles and often choir sings a song. Bob crow Bob Crow, made out of dough, eat him up with salt and herring.

It's scary in the night, spades at the ready. Bob Crow, Bob crow. Sebelius was a terrible drunkard, a dog sniffing a ditch, frisky carrier lumbering hound, two dogs then the Colossus of Rhodes, young marble giants wind in the rigging, a front with a towel in a doorway, like Harry Lyon in post war Vienna. Wheels within wheels, the windmills of someone else's mind. mind how you go, sir. There's room for one more inside. There's room for one more skip at the rubbish dump Babylon or sharp, singing singing a cathedral choir nunc Dimittis and he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.

You could not make it up a new ghost.

Just bear with me a moment while I line up the next thing I'm gonna read. I read that now. There are no drap girls in synthesis in this piece. Last week, we held a funeral service for the parish wolf. Although none of us is sure if it's really dead. It's howling has not been heard for 12 years though. And under our laws, a death certificate can be issued for a missing move after just five years. The general feeling in the parish was summed up by the Sexton in a gnosis nailed Luther fashion to the door of the church. Even in the absence of a corpse it would be for the good of the parish if obstacles if obstacles were held. This was the gist of his notice. Though it was couched in the mighty pros he deployed even when writing matron notes for the parish newsletter. And he did not on any account use the word closure One reason the Sexton is so persuasive is that his appearance and bearing are strong, strongly reminiscent of the act of James Roberts and Justice 1907 to 1975. This is no accident. Over the years, the Sexton has worked hard to imitate that booming voice, and he has undergone cosmetic surgery, the better to ape the appearance of the man who were not appearing in films kept busy as a naturalist, writing driver and falconry expert. Before dawn before dawn, on the morning of the funeral, there was a teeming downpour. The rain had ceased by the time we gathered in the churchyard, but the punctum trees were drenched, water droplets dripping from the tiny gray spongy buds, each bad, like the brain of monkeys, plus an extraordinary number of puzzles that formed on the path, and there were many paths converging on some bibley did did frizzes the only church for miles around all others having been smashed to ruination by the sextons predecessor, single handedly. He was twice the size of the present incumbent, and then a titan among sextons and a brute and the parish has been much better since he wilted away and was carted off to a Mercy Home. No doc splashed in the puzzles for word had not yet reached them that the Parrish wolf was dead, or at least thought to be dead, and no duck dead come near for fear of being torn the bit. I had been asked to read the obsequies and have prepared what I thought was a pretty speech. I have a weakness for alliteration, and made use of lots of W words describing the parish Wolfers winsome and windswept and waterlogged and wirey and Wobegon witless. There was little truth in any of this, for the signal fact about the wolf was that it was for the most part invisible. came a fat guru, the village bus driver, claimed to have seen it seen it crossing the road once or twice, and a preposterous tabloid astrologer Jonathan caner, who wants to spend a week holed up in our mob brimstone Bed and Breakfast establishment said that the wolf paid him nocturnal visits in his dingy room. But few of us gave these tales any credence. Yet, despite remaining unseen the wolf was what had been a mighty presence in our parish, and I felt it deserved a memorable send off with all those w words, even if what I said was inaccurate. Our Vicar had been abducted by a car dealer of Rogue tandis and was tied up in a turret somewhere. So the Sexton took charge of the service. When it came my turn to speak no sooner had I propped my notepad on the lectern and cleared my throat. The neck came a bellowing of cows from the field to joining the church. My words were drowned out. The cows bellowed all day and all night and into the next day, for they were mad old farmer fracked

cows, and there were hundreds of them massive and ungainly and bellowing. The funeral broke up in disarray, and we repaired to a hangar, the village airfield, and we ate cake and macadamia nuts and those under the shadow of gigantic propellers. And when we emerged look, ducks populated the puddles. The Parrish wolf was dead and gone.

Oh, let's just now sing the praises of noted swift puppeteer Rolf swift pup, preferably to a free jazz accompaniment with bongos or on second thoughts about us not, for when we sing it is a god awful caterwauling that sets the teeth on age and makes birds plummet from the sky stone dead. Instead, let us list some of the books which over the past 40 years, the noted Swiss puppeteer has interpreted in dramatic form in 18 hour puppet shows to adoring audiences in every canton of Switzerland. The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann, one Lonely Night by Mickey spear line, me and my ectoplasm by algernon spooky, the decline of the west by Oswald Spangler, Chappaquiddick the real story by James Lange and K DeWitt, Jr. verbose twaddle by will self. The Loch Ness Mystery solved by Ronald Benz the thing on the doorstep by HP Lovecraft the printer Rosendo by Antony hope the prisoner of Brenda by Max desharnais Rolf Swiss pups puppets are made from his own secret patented substance. Now those Swiss puppy 13 and this gives them an eerily lifelike appearance. In the words of the puppeteering critic Horst pup crit. These puppets are eerily lifelike if a few conjoined and twisted pipe cleaners, and a knob of potty can be imbued with life. The puppets a mute chiefly because ROVs with pups voicebox was surgically removed following a traumatic childhood ice skating accident. The sheer dramatic intensity of his productions is made all the more sheer and dramatic and intense by the resounding silence in which they are performed, dropped pins etc. in person, Rolf Swiss pub has a haunted and ravaged appearance, which has led to rumors that when he is alone with his puppets, they come to life and torment him as Michael Redgrave was tormented by his ventriloquist dummy in the film dead of night. 1945 certainly is true that the swift puppeteer has been found on occasion staggering through the streets of Zurich and Lucerne and Winterthur and Geneva, drink sudden and incontinent. But if he has a tragic figure, he's also enormously popular with Swiss tinies who clap their little hands and scraped with joy at the mere mention of his name. So if today we do not sing his praises, we can screech them like a small overtired Swiss child screech and screech and screech and screech, and screech and screech, and screech and screech and screech, and screeching screeching screeching screeching screeching screech until we're carted off and confined to remote Swiss facility high in the Alps, where brutish orderlies will torment us with pipe cleaners and knobs of coffee.

Frank Key  27:55
And so with black screeching of overtired Swiss children really ringing in your ears. That's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I hope you enjoyed the references to pictures of trap girls in synthesis. And of course, to the laughing gnome bye bye
