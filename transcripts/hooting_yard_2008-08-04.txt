My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. I see Radiophonic arm of the global hooting yard franchise and actually been off air for the last three weeks due to the resonance scheduling shenanigans. Anyway, I thought it would be helpful for listeners to be apprised of what I was up to between 630 and 7pm on the past three Thursdays. First week, it slipped my mind that I was not required to babble into a microphone for half an hour. So I turned up at the studio, as usual of sprightly mean, as usual stylishly in garbed in a Flemish cheese cloth suit as usual. As usual, I rattled my tally stick on the railings of the great iron gate to announce my arrival. Now, what normally happens is that the gatekeeper emerges from his cubby heart and unlocks many many padlocks before swinging the gate open a tad to let me in. On this particular Thursday, the seventh of September, I think it was seventh of August sorry. Because my presence wasn't required. I wasn't met by the gatekeeper, but confronted indeed attacked by Skippy the resonance dog, who bounded over the gate and gnashed his glistening spittle fleck fangs at me. Unfortunately, I had no bones in the pockets of my suit. Neither real one's rich in marrow, nor toy one's made out of rubber. Either kind would have served to distract the savage hound. Of course, as with any number of twizzle e plastic novelties of the kind, one can pick up for tuppence at funfairs. lacking any such item that would endear me to a slobbering and terrifying dog, I fled. When I got home, I wrote a stiff letter to the powers that be at resonance, the gist of which was that I'd always been under the impression that Skippy was a blanket hound on hand to assist the blind. With a sideline in rat catching and occasional Twilight howling. I have yet to receive a reply. second week 14th of August, I spent the evening of the next Thursday in a tent pitched in a field, where a combination kiboko gift reunion and Jethro Tull convention was taking place. People are often surprised when they realize just how many souls Oh, fealty to both gift and towel. As for me, I was camped in the field for purposes which had nothing to do with either of them, and that was in a filthy temper. So much so that at one point I've rent the sleeves of my Flemish cheese cloth suit jacket in Umbridge. But that happened after 7pm so is strictly speaking out with the purview of this jaunty little piece. third week was this time last week, I was dusty in the desert and strung out in Erie missed upon a bench in the grounds of an owl sanctuary. And I held in my hands the copper wires have a mechanism of which I had but little understanding. Lembit opik or someone very much like him, was lurking in the vicinity, equally dusty and no less burdened, but somewhat more adult, and trading in grotesquerie with a person whose arms never ceased flapping. This person I knew not. I was glad of the cushions on my bench for I was at the very extremity of exhaustion, having sprinted to the owl sanctuary along a rustic lane pursued by Skippy the resonance dog, or by his Phantom. The more I think about it, the more certain I am that it was the Phantom Skippy. For why in the name of heaven would the real Skippy have pounced upon me as I emerged from a bleak cafeteria where he and I had taken tea. And by Jingo, I had certainly taken tea. Never before in my life, had I taken such a copious amount of tea mug after mug of the mug, and every mug chipped and every sources sloshed with slops, and every teaspoon caked with rust. It was indeed the bleakest of cafeterias. And when I left it, the Phantom Skippy chased me along the lane, and I dodged through a hedge into the owl sanctuary and found refuge on the cushion bench and Lembit opik or someone Very much like him, handed me a mechanism and bite me Hold tight to the copper wires and I slumped, strung out thankful, a dusty and bidis and in the eerie mist.

This is a story called The Temple of Hoon, fat Gar. And the word Buddhism turns up in this as well, not that I'm repeating myself because it was constructed mostly from Canvas and cloth and the canvas and cloth were fed on by mouth. The Temple of Hoon fat Gar is sometimes known as the Mathieson Temple of Hoon, fat Gar, ravaged by moths and time and lashed by wild winds that blow across the top pooter is a wonder the temple still stands 1000 years after the first devotees entered it through the sacred flap. It has of course been much patched and stitched over the centuries, and its fabric is regularly stiffened with starch, carried in canisters for miles upon miles by worshipers of the hideous bad God fatso, for it is he to whom the temple is dedicated. The Wild winds that lash and bat of the Templer meteorologically very interesting indeed. Students of the weather have been perplexed by them ever since modern wild wind studies began before our scientific age, of course, the sheer weirdness of the winds that blow across the top pooter was ascribed to the Mercurial and petulant nature of the hideous back God fatso, for it was thought that he was responsible for them as he was for everything in the universe. We are wiser now, but no closer to getting to grips with the wild, lacking winds. Those who still believe in fat, so have a simple explanation. for them. The winds are the physical manifestation of the temperament of fat souls magic pig. Actually, he has two magic pigs, but we can safely ignore one of them for a moment or two. The idea is that this particular pig, which it must be understood is not a real pig in any sentence, somehow sends the winds howling across the top pooter whenever it is fractious or hungry, or obstreperous, or mad and or otherwise out of sorts. Why the hippie is back God fatso does nothing to placate his magic pig is an ineffable mystery. The religion dedicated to him is short on theologians of any stripe. Although one of the few to have addressed the problem contended that fatso spent much of his time, pacifying the other magic pig, which, if ever it fully awakened, would make the wild winds that batter the temple seem like tiny pipsqueak gusts of summer breeze. Other so called scholars argued that this implied the other magic pig was somehow more powerful when fatso himself a clear heresy. So the first theologian was put in a Crusher and crushed there used to be at least five crushes on the mud playing around the temple of Hoon, fac Gar, so we must assume that there were plenty of heretics to be crushed. Occasionally, a bright young whippersnappers archaeologist will announce plans for a dig at the site, hoping to exuma a fantastical horde of crushed bones, but not one of these schemes ever succeeds. It is said that fatso himself sabotages the expeditions by causing shipwrecks and helicopter crashes, and by pickling the archaeologist brains while they sleep. In these ploys, he calls on the assistance of his flock of bitterns. Unlike the two pigs, the bitterns are not magical, but nor of course have a real, their Phantom spectral buttons beholden to fat so for some service, he did them in the distant past. We cannot guess what that might have been for. It's a topic suspiciously neglected by all the priests and wizards and jumping about men who interpret fatso to his followers, or, I should say, who used to do so. There are none of them left alive today, at least none that we know of. believers in fact, so we're a dwindling bank. Often greasy and myopic and spindly and gormless. They tend to lack a LAN.

Most of them probably would be crushed in the crushers if the crushers were still there because one thing we can be quite clear about the hideous back God fatso is that he expected His devotees to cut a dash. There may have been few opportunities for glittering social panache on the pre historic top pooter especially with those wild wins. But what rare chance is there were were seized on by fat toes followers, great attention was paid to the angles of hats, the tying of cravat and affectations of toffee nosed insouciance. This is not to discount a concomitant yearning for the mud encouraged by one of the magic pigs. So today, there are a few hardware canisters of starch for miles and miles to stiffen the moth eaten canvas and cloth of the temple of Hoon, fat Gar, perhaps in 100 years there will be none at all. Yet fatso himself will still, as far as he is concerned, hold sway over the universe, and his magic pig will still make the wild winds blow, and his other even more frightening magic pig will doze and slumber dreaming of havoc. It's easy for us to dismiss their very existence. Until that is we have struggled stylishly across the inhospitable top pooter and stooped down to crawl through the sacred flap to enter the temple. Then we see what all those believers through the centuries saw a site so magnificent and terrifying that we sprawl helplessly in the mud shrieking brains been designed garga for the God of all gods.

Another the Olympics are over, but it was during the Olympics, of course, that we were hunting out off the air. And there was a lot of press coverage of the frankly, bonkers dietary regime followed by Uber champ Michael Phelps. I don't know if any of you read about it in the papers, but he just eats this incredible diet every day, thousands and thousands of calories. It's instructive to compare his daily food intake with that of fictional athletes Bob net tavole, the sprinter and pole vaulter who thrilled the masses during the last century. We're fortunate then that the fictional athletes coach and mentor, the all too real and non fictional, old hallowed, devoted many pages of his memoirs to this very topic. Old Hello himself grew up in popery, and often had little else to eat but bird seeds stolen from bird tables on the lawns of bird obsessed villages in his bird choked village. Later in life, dining and expensive restaurants, he would often demand a bowl of millet as a side helping and being old halibut. He always got what he wanted. When it came to devising a diet for his sporting protege, the irascible and chained smoking coach paid heed to the theories of the nutritionist catnip wedge, who was himself a top bobsled competitor, though never a champion. Wedge was convinced that he could have won a mantle pieces worth of cups and medals had eaten more laughing cow brand processed cheese triangles during his active bobsleighing years, backing up this theory with abstruse charts and diagrams. Oh hello could make head nor tail of these, but was won over by a certain hectoring tone in the nutritionists prose. As he wrote in his memoirs, I could make head nor tail of wedges, AB screws, charts and diagrams. But there was something in his hectoring prose that convinced me He must be correct. That it was that when I took fictional athletes Bob net to vol under my capacious wing, I insisted that he eat a dozen packs of laughing cow brand processed cheese triangles for breakfast every day, including the packaging with the tin foil and that little red thread ostensibly designed to unseal each portion. Within a fortnight he came second in the ball, just spinning athletic Club's annual rain soaked 500 yard dash practice. In all his previous attempts at this race, the spindly fictional athlete had toppled to the ground in a swoon at the report of the starting pistol. It was the first time I realized that I had a future champion on my hands aren't held hands by the way, well, Harry and curiously fat, but that need not concern us here. He saw how the more obscure writings of catnip wedge and those who did not really understand them as the translations were unreliable. He soon had prescriptions for Bob net to voles lunches and dinners, as well as his breakfast. Lunch he wrote, consisted of curd and balls of sewage and reconstituted meat slices on a bed of sponge and fish in it washed down with two big tumblers of aerated malt vinegar sprinkled with plenty of pips, followed by a slab of seed cake and a toffee apple. Dinner was a whole vegan pig substitute boiled in linseed oil with a drizzle of cognac. Two bowls of raw is of wheat with paprika and enriched mulch, duck brains, cornflakes, hedge clippings, roast potatoes, cabbage and sugar snap peas, and a dozen smokers Pop Tarts, plus pails of water siphon from a distant, eerie pond. If he had a race coming up the next day, I insisted that the fictional athlete tuck into an extra supper of innumerable sausages in sausage g sauce straight from the sausage Saltzman. Bob net to Vols performances both on the track and then the poll vote underwent a dramatic improvement, but he failed to become an outright winner until I would have made a significant unexpected addition to his diet.

All else would have been as a note he wrote, had I not experienced a mental thunderclap on Thursday morning, I had good reason to be thankful to cabinet wegg for showing me how to shovel food down fictional athletes Bob needs to evolve galette. But for him to be a perennial runner up was not good enough for me. That morning, as I hacked and splattered my way through a coughing fit brought on by my umpteenth cigarette of the day, the supply of oxygen to my pulsating cranium was temporarily cut off. And during the resulting spasms, I think I had some sort of abnormal hallucinatory insight. Whatever it was, when I came to rising on the linoleum with sputum, dribbling down my goatee, it was crystal clear to me that what was missing from all of wages advice was guidance upon elevenses. Now for any athletes fictional or otherwise, elevenses is the most important meal of the day, I realized I would have to devise something for my protege or to some snack that would make him the world beater, I knew he could be. And so began a series of experiments. Over the next few months old halabi tried out a bewildering variety of elevens is recipes on the lanky runner, including bath Oliver's distilled ditch water, lettuce and castor sugar Flan jugs, stoat fishing pastry, contaminated yogurt, pronounced yo hort chocolates with roll, greasy Partridge pie milk of magnesia for a straw, and the bone marrow of sacrificially slaughtered toggenburg goats. Some of these snacks knocked seconds off Bob Nick devolves sprinting times, but some made him windy or sluggish or hysterical. None seemed to work consistently. The breakthrough came on the eve of the fictional athletes most important race to date. Back to the memoirs. The breakthrough came on the eve of the blister lane exciting top sprinting in inclement weather challenge ribbon. I desperately wanted Bob net devall to be able to twine that legendary ribbon around his legendary, albeit fictional forehead, and I was so fraught that I collapsed into a coma. unsupervised. The fictional athlete spent the whole day snacking on elevenses neglecting his breakfast, lunch and dinner. Not only did he scarf down my various recommended elevenses, but he got out the pots and pans and cobbled together some of his own, such as a delicious lemon marang pie with eels. The next day at blister lane, he triumphed. We never looked back. I don't know about you, but I find these memories almost unbearably moving. So much so that I'm going to solve into my napkin math. Phelps may be the most successful Olympian in history. But he's not been coached by old hollub. And compare to fictional athlete Bob Nick tavole. He's just a we the milk SOP.

Much has been written in the past by people who know of these things about the knitting of knots. knots we learn has been knit from cord and twine and rope and string and wool, among other materials. While it's true that more knots have been tied rather than not without the aid of knitting needles, it remains the case that the knitted knot has its own special place in our hearts, whether our hearts flutter like a birds or a squirrels heart, or pound like a drum. For with the knitted knot, we say a true craft. Whereas it can be argued that the May of tying of knots, while sometimes requiring deafness and digital agility can as well be done by a brute in a hurry. Not so the knitted knot, hurrying brutes, particularly those whose tails thump upon the ground as they rush headlong to the scene of their next enormity, and most unlikely to have the patience and wit necessary for the knitting of a knot. Nor are their paws likely to be dexterous enough to handle knitting needles, or even crochet hooks. crochet is not knitting Of course, and the crochet not is a different creature to the knitted knot, and one with its own literature, exemplars and Paragons. There exists pattern books containing instructions for knitting knots, and depictions of knots so knitted, but it would be a mistake to think that one needs such a pattern before embarking upon the knitting of a knot. Some of the finest knitted knots have been the work of improvisers brave, adventurous souls who begin to knit with no other aim in mind than the knitting of a knot. its final form unimagined, not even a blurred Wisp in the mind's eye of the knitter. Even improv not knitters, however, need a degree of foresight, for they will wish to avoid the act of knitting being interrupted by a hurrying brute. Such interruptions can prove fatal, if not to the knitter, then almost certainly to the knot, a brute in a hurry, coming upon a knitter will tear and shred and rip and rend. All the while roaring, its brute cries as its tail thumps the ground. Thus, the knitter of knotted is advised in many of these books of the past to find a secluded haven in which to knit to be hidden behind a clump of brambles, or snug in a concealed nook in a cave, or safe behind the ramparts of a mighty and towering fortress. Each of these has been recommended, and this is choice of refuge will depend to some extent on the nature of the brute so hurry through the land in which they knit. There are single brutes who roam alone, and pears, and occasionally trios, but by far the most common and the most frightening are those who hurry about in packs. Various writers have pointed out that the knitting of knots can use the knots they have knitted as part of the operators to bind and immobilize a hurrying brute. This is undoubtedly true, but these same writers tend to neglect the inconvenient fact that before such binding and immobilizing and judicious use of knitted knots can occur, the hurrying brute must first be overpowered, in most cases, at least those cases that bear examination. The overpowering of a brute in a hurry requires inhuman strength, and the kind of musculature rarely found in the average, not knitter. Even more important than to ensure that before the very first clack of needle against needle, the knitter has located a place of safety in which to knit. Perhaps the finest of the books I chanced upon when researching this little talk is actually more a pamphlet than a book proper. It is how to knit knots while remaining invisible to hurrying brutes by Dobson out of print, and contains a plethora of terrific mezzotints by the mezzotint. Just read timpte Dobson claims to invented to have invented a so called enshrouding spectral ether cloak, which, when activated, renders are not knitter invisible, thus obviating the need for a time consuming search for

clumps of brambles, nooks in caves or mighty and towering fortresses. It also silences the clack of knitting needles, or at least drowns out the clack by generating a noise like the buzzing of a million Hornets. orderable only to a brute hurrying past its tail thumping the ground. I suspect that Dobson's cloak is wholly spurious, but the pamphlet is worth it for the mezzotints alone.

Excuse me, I'm finally this week. Here are a few useful things I learned while reading. Buchanan's Journal of man, Volume One number four, published in May 1887. First of all, pianos have lately been made from paper in Germany instead of wood, with great improvement in the tone. Secondly, there is no denying that the young man about town of the 19th century is blocked upon our boasted modern civilization. His is not a pleasant figure to contemplate. Though it is one we shall all see very often and know very well, closed, irreproachable in the most expensive Raymond that London tailors and unlimited credit can supply. He lives leisurely and luxuriously on his father's money and his wife's and being after his natural term of days later away in a tumor, Mount obon ends his existence without making any more impression upon the world's history than a falling rose leaf or an August crickets faintest chirp. And thirdly, in 1885, we were informed of the success of spirits at Cleveland, Ohio, in communicating messages by the telegraphic method in rapping, in which our millionaire friend Mr. j. h. Wade, has taken much interest. A little apparatus has been constructed with which the spirits give their communications in great variety. I have repeatedly stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased physicians have always proved in my experience, more reliable than those of the living. This has been verified at Cleveland, the late Dr. wells of Brooklyn has been giving diagnoses and prescriptions through the telegraph. I think we can agree with a correspondent in the vine land rostrum, who said of the journals editor, Jr. Buchanan. We never read an article from the pan of this world renowned thinker, but that we feel we're in the presence of one whose shoes latchet we are unworthy to unloose. So Buchanan was obviously a kind of Dobson figure of his day. I'm particularly impressed. I think that by the idea that dead doctors will be more reliable in their diagnoses than ones who are still alive. Still, that's what it said in Buchanan's Journal of man. That's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I will be back next week. God willing, and have a lovely week. Bye bye.
