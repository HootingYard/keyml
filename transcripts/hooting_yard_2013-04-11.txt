Good evening, my name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. You know what? Sorry, I'm going to start again. Good evening. My name is William Tell, and I am an archer of repute like Caspar baudrate. The hotelier who pioneered winter sports. I'm a man of Switzerland, country of chocolates with role and neutrality. My son Walter has a large head, and as he lopped along the mountain path, it tilted upon his neck and swung from side to side, he had become an object of ridicule among the goat herds. My wife, Coco, delved into ancient books to see if she could discover a spell to shrink Walters head. I was fully supportive of this strategy, and entered many crossbow tournament's The idea being to win prize monies. So cocoa could afford to buy more and more ancient books. Though one contest in every canton of Switzerland, and even abroad in Italy, where they called me Guglielmo, and our chalet was piled high with ancient books. Cocoa failed to discover an effective spell. Walter became low spirited and unusually cantankerous. I feared for my coop of hens. Towards rich my son began to matter animated versions. He was projecting his inner turmoil against harmless poultry, a psychological commonplace, goat, goat herds are larger and violent when threatened. Desperate, I sought advice from the Swiss Institute of deportment, I was told that the muscles in Walters neck could be strengthened rather than his head shrunk. The way to do this was to make him carry pieces of fruit balanced atop his crown. That goes some way to explaining why Walter had an apple on his head. When Herman gettler, Austria invoked of outdoors came riding by on his horse by every outfit in Switzerland, how I hated the vocht I shot the apple of Walters head with my crossbow to show gessler that I was not a man he should mess with. I had a pomegranate in my pocket, and was about to balance it on gettler his head when I was apprehended by his henchmen chase credit, my quick thinking some unlatch the hens from the coop and set the fear of God into them. He pointed at the henchmen and yelled, kill, they immediately unhandled me and fled alongside their vote of outdoors. Inside the chalet, Coco had brewed a potion from a recipe in one of the ancient books. Walter took a sip and spat it out, but I drank an entire goblet full. Shortly afterwards, I lost touch with reality. My name is William Tell, and that is my statement. I cannot vouch for its accuracy, as the potion is still coursing through my veins. I must now go and tell everything I know about Switzerland, to a man named Ruskin, who says he is writing a book about this fair country.

Frank Key  04:37
That was the statement of William Tell. And what follows is William Tell second statement of particulars. My name is William tel. And I am an archer of repute. much of my time is spent hiking the 26 cantons of my Swiss homeland, firing arrows from my cross By that which presents itself to me as an appropriate target. In a single morning to give an example, between breakfast and elevenses I might shoot at a rampaging wild Swiss bore 100% of the Austrian vote of altdorf or an orchard fruit. So accurate is my marksmanship. I have been known to balance an apple on my son's head, take a considerable number of paces away from him, turn, aim and splice the apple into with a lethal wood and metal missile without harming a hair on Walters abnormally large head. Walter is my son's name. Despite the size of his head, I have not yet tried to balance either a wild Swiss boar or a hench person on it. That sort of thing would probably delight a circus crowd between turns by clowns and performing seals and at times of harvest failure when the tail chalet is short of food. Sorry, that sort of thing would probably delight a circus crowd between turns by clowns and performing sales and at times of harvest failure. When the towel chalet is short of food. I have considered it. Walter would have to be persuaded to wear some kind of brace of metal and leather to support his neck and his back. And I can foresee problems in so persuading him, for he is very fashion conscious. Quite a dandy. In fact, though, just now as occurred to me that slight in the United States President JFK wore a back brace throughout his 1000 days in office without the citizenry being aware of the fact. I must point that out to Walter as reassurance Should I decide to go down the circus performing route next time the towels go hungry? Over the years I have fired arrows from my crossbow in all 26 with candles in cloud, including those which were one sufficiently half cantons but I have not shot at orchard fruit, whether balanced on Walters large bonds or not in each and every one. consulting my records I see that no fruit has been in my cross both sides in odd this violin zog solothurn author govia I must rectify those emissions. For I'm a determined Archer and a completist. I still remember the afternoon I was finally able to place an X against to see no in my handwritten Canton list. There I was in the market square of bellinzona. The capital my heart swelling with pride as a hardy band of my Italian speaking countrymen cheered there, Guglielmo tell to the rafters. The rafters were those of a temporary wooden structure erected for my display of archery skills. For wild Swiss bores had been captured in net by toughened fearless hunters. One more tied to each wooden corner post and I had shot them with my crossbow, one after another, spinning around with the grace of a ballerina. Walter was a babe in arms at the time, the arms being those of my wife, Coco, who watched my feet of bull slaughter with crossbow from a safe distance, sitting on a bench at the edge of the market square outside a butcher shop selling spicy Italianate sausages.

Frank Key  08:50
When my third statement of particulars is Drew, I plan to say a few words about sausages in Switzerland. My son Walter will be a great help, for he is apprenticed to a butcher in our home village in the canton of Ury. The Butcher was first alarmed by Walters gigantic head, but when he learned that his papaya was the legendary Archer William tell his ecstasy was such that it rivaled that of the woodcarvers Steiner, as documented in Verner Hertzog 1974 film. Steiner Of course, it's a matter of Switzerland, a skiing Ace, and his first name is Walter. I like to think he was named after my son, but I've not had an opportunity to question his parents on the matter. But as I said, I'm a determined Archer and I will Winkle out the truth even if I have to tie the woodcarver steiners papa and mama to the corner posts of a temporary wooden structure in the market square of a Canton capital and take aim at them with my crossbow primed and ready to fire.

Frank Key  10:35
I received a letter from while I received a number of letters from Zippy blank cat, and one of them read as follows. Dear Mr. Key, forgive me for writing to you yet again, but I think you may be able to help tackle a massive and debilitating psychological trauma, which has affected me for the best part of my life. In my speed reading of the entire shooting yard canon, I noticed that you had included two statements of particulars by famed Archer and man of Switzerland William Tell. At the end of the second statement, hotel promises a third statement, in which he will address the subject of sausages in Switzerland. But this third statement, has never seen the light of day. I cannot imagine why you would put the kibosh on such a text. So colonias scribed, the non appearance of the statement to forgetfulness on your part. Having said that, if you had to suppress it for reasons to do with seamlessness or national security, I quite understand, and I will leave you alone, and then stayed right to the lovely Julian Assange, currently at the date of writing, imprisoned in an agreeable English country house before heading for the Embassy of Ecuador. I'm sure lovely Julian will be able to unearth William tells third statement of particulars for me if anybody can. Perhaps I ought to explain why I have a burning desire to read it. You say? When I was young, I may have CIT. I begged my parents Mr. And Mrs. blanket to take me to Switzerland to see the gnomes of Zurich. I was fascinated by gnomes at the time, having Raul read a children's edition of Rudolf steiners Theosophy an introduction to the supersensible knowledge of the world and the destination of man 1910 were in Rudolf Steiner writes of invisible bones, among other fantastic beings, imperceptible does the centers of ordinary lumping proles. I was keen to commune with the gnomes of Zurich and badgered my parents incessantly. Now, my mama and papa were great admirers of the big fat spider, Harold Wilson, and knew that he had coined the phrase gnomes of Zurich in 1956. As a pejorative term for Swiss bankers. They knew in other words, that there were no actual gnomes, invisible or otherwise to be found in that fair city. But rather than telling me the truth, they decided to teach me a hard lesson. Driven half insane by my unceasing and whiny demands, they whisked me off to Zurich. At a tender age to tender, I would learn to be crushed by disappointment and have it driven home to me that our political leaders, even the big fat spidery ones, can be monsters of mendacity, unlike say, lovely Julian Assange, who carries the shining torch of truth at all times, and in all circumstances. It was that trip to anomalous Zurich, which led to the massive and debilitating psychological trauma I mentioned earlier. Now to the reason I am desperate to read William tells third statement of particulars.

Frank Key  14:21
On the third day of our visit, by which time I had become a wailing and screeching bundle of fractious hysteria, mama and papa tried to appease me by taking me to a butcher shop. Perhaps they thought the sight of raw meat and blood and then trails and huge sharp cleavers and slices and glistening lives and the butcher's apron soaked in gore would shut me up, as it did, but for quite an unexpected reason. our visit to the shop coincided with a sausage tasting gala, which trunks of a variety of sausages from every candle of Switzerland were produced. printed on paper plates. The Butcher's apprentice stood there in a puddle of I think it was balls blood, handing out the paper plates to all comers. As I was still bawling and screeching at the absence of gnomes, my papaya stifled my cries by plucking from a paper plate a chunk of Swiss sausage and cramming it into my God. As I bent down on it in voluntarily, I caught a fugitive glimpse of a hitherto invisible known standing slap bang next to the butcher's apprentice. I swallowed the mouthful, and then no vanished. Without having the manners to ask. I snatched the second chunk of sausage from the past paper plate and sank my girly fangs into it. Alas, it was a different type of Swiss sausage, and the invisible gnome failed to reappear. I proceeded to scarf as many free sausage samples as I could, but to no avail. The first bite of that first sausage was the only one that revealed the invisible known to me. Two hours later, the butcher announced that the gala was over, and we were turfed out into the street. The next day, we left Zurich forever. In the year since I've been trying to find out exactly what kind of sausage it was that made visible to me. Oh, so briefly, the magical world of gnomes, of which Rudolf Steiner so super sensibly wrote, I have haunted butcher shops from here to kingdom come and taken bites out of thousands of sausages. Not all of them Swiss. Not all of them even cooked, but never yet have I again seen that Zurich butcher is known, nor one of his kind. So you can imagine the excitement with which I read the art of repute, a man of Switzerland, William Tell, in his third statement of particulars would address the subject of sausages. As far as I'm aware, we have nothing on record. Excuse me. As far as I'm aware, we have nothing on record to suggest that William Tell ever commune with knowns. But I feel laughably confident that I will be able to win over him is saucy DRI. some significant clue. I need to read that damn statement of particulars. Mr. Key, please oblige yours yet again. Zippy blanket. I'm afraid that at the time I received this letter, I had to inform Zippy that the document she is so keen to read was stolen from the hooting yard Data Silo, by a ragamuffin in the pay of lovely lovely Julian Assange. Lovely Julian has not yet seen fit to release William tells third statement of particulars, I understand, because it contains compromising details about lovely Julian himself, the kinds of sordid details which will never ever be placed in the public domain. The mind boggles at the mental image of William Tell, aiming his bow at a Swiss sausage atop the lovely head of lovely Julian Assange. And it's surely better that a veil is drawn over the whole squalid business. Sorry, Zippy.

Frank Key  18:52
We've had two statements of particulars from William Tell, and we've had the tried to get the third, although it seems to still be in the possession of Julian Assange. But we've now received a fourth statement of particulars from William Tell our speakers one who, in all good conscience, for better or worse, because it seemed that the time and in that place to be the best, say, I've got that a bit wrong. I'm going to start again. I speak as one who in all good conscience, for better or worse, because it seemed at that time and in that place, to be the best thing to do. And not just the best, but the most meat, the most valiant, if done with both dash and Verve commingled with rectitude and punk teleo. In front of my countrymen, they're gathered as witnesses, that they might brew it My name far and wide, and yea, tell their children and their children's children, so that my name and my deed go ringing them The centuries here in Alpine Switzerland and further abroad across all corners of the globe. I speak I say, and those words to will ring down the ages and across the world as one who gloriously and patriotically, and with pinpoint precision and an eagle eye, if I say so myself, though I am a self effacing Archer not given to boasting about my abilities, even so, by any objective measure, one must acknowledge my feet, and I blush as I tell it, beetroot red, ah, beetroot, King of vegetables, at least for some, but it is not a vegetable of which I speak, but a fruit, a fruit I placed atop the head of my son, and then stepped back and hoisted my crossbow, and shot my arrow and clove that piece of fruit in Twain, while leaving my son, untouched, unharmed, though, it has to be said I might traumatized, as they would say in the psychobabble of a post Freudian universe, my son crying, Papa, papa, what on earth did you think you were doing? And what if you'd missed the fruit and your arrow plunged into me, your little son, and which I strode forward toward him and clapped him on the back and told him to back up and not to be a ninny, and I assured him that his name too, would resound through the years as the son of William Tell, but I was wrong about that was I not for it seems few, if any, remember the name of my son, which was Walter.

Frank Key  22:16
And that's quite enough about William Tell for this week, and in possibly indeed for this year. We move from William Delta, Wilhelm Reich. I'm reading a fantastic book at the moment, published in 2011. by Christopher Turner, called adventures in the Orgasmatron Wilhelm Reich and the invention of sex and very amusing. Wilhelm Reich Of course, the inventor of the orgone accumulator, basically like a cupboard that you went and sat in. Many, many people in the mid 20s or post war America and elsewhere. We're very keen on the orgone accumulator, William S. Burroughs built his own. Sean Connery I think was a big fan. And Norman Mailer, of course. Anyway, there's there's some great bits in this book. And here's a quotation This is actually Alfred casin. writing about Isaac Rosenfeld, who was in the 30s, or 40s, Isaac Rosenfeld was the great hope of American literature, but died young and failed. Basically, he was a great friend and rival of Saul Bellow. Now kind of forgotten, I think, because he, as I say he, his career ended in failure. But here's Alfred Kazdin writing about Isaac Rosenfeld. Like so many of Isaac's attempts to apply his Amanda imaginative vision to life, this organ box was compromised by his poverty and his many interests. It was too obviously a homemade bargain basement or goen box. It looked more like a cardboard closet or staged telephone booth than it did a scientific apparatus by which to recover the sexual energy won or lost culture. Isaac's organ box stood up in the midst of an enormous confusion of bedclothes review copies, manuscripts, children, and their many people who went in and out of the room, as if it were the bathroom belligerently sitting inside his organ box, daring Phyllis Stein's to laugh. Isaac nevertheless looked lost, as if we were waiting in his telephone booth for a call that was not coming through.

Frank Key  25:59
I'm not sure we've got time for the next piece I was going to read, which was an old piece called perhaps this attack. But so I think I'll save that until next week. And I'll also be able to tell you then why perhaps this tack is on my mind at the moment. Which is basically to do with a special show, not on resonance, but you'll be able to listen to it a special show or a podcast by some American people, where they're doing a frank key doubleheader where the great norm Sherman who reads my stories, unlike anyone else will be reading two of my stories, and one of them is the return of perhaps to tack. And there's also a story called pabs attack. Anyway, I think well, what we'll do instead because I haven't got time is we'll we'll bring the show to an end for this week. Don't forget to visit the hooting our website, hooting yard.org, where you can read everything that you ever hear me read on the show. There's lots of pictures to look at, you can buy one of the seven paperbacks that are available from the hooting art show. Or you can just send me some money, make a donation or take out a subscription. And you can spend untold hours on the website, really, if you go back over the archive. So I suppose to bring the show to an end this week. We should not in a week that seems to have been completely dominated by Margaret Thatcher. I think I will, I would say merely this and in fact, it's not words that come from me. But I think the most significant words spoken about satura in the past week. Both appear both appeared on the channel four documentary Maggie and made by Jon Snow, which was actually shown on Monday evening. The first quotation is by Matthew Paris. And the second quotation is by Jon Snow himself, and I'll leave you with their words and see you next week. She walked like a partridge she scuttled about like a head.
