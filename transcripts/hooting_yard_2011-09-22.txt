Good evening, my name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM, live from London. And so where this week we're going to finish the marathon reading of unspeakable desolation pouring down from the stars with the final two chapters, and we've got plenty of time to do that. And then we'll have some other stuff. But before going on, we'll have the chapter 14 obsequies for last tauk struck by lightning, which was first published in an edition of 25 copies in 1994. Long, long ago during the major administration, and has never been republished since. So here is chapter 14. Many had chosen well in PopCap. everything went according to plan. Allah wishes backlit supplied a tiny cadet named vague, who scurried among the mourners with the funeral shedule taking off the names, logging the times, counting the animals and ensuring that minis wishes were met doesn't letter actually had expected. The Reverend two's sermon was the centerpiece of the funeral. He stood poised in the pulpit of the gravel flap auditorium, and as the rustle of applause finally died, he peered over his sinister spectacles at the 26th mourners cleared his throat and began his sermon. Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here in memory of Professor Lars tauk. How can I, in my creaky voice do justice to such a man? I could tell you the story of his life, but he was 94 and it would take me days, even weeks to recount even the mirror Central's were I to pick only selected epiphanic incidents, the reinvention of bleach, the ascent of the mountain at Hoon, a fistfight with a bus conductor, the creation of the postage stamp zoo, I would be imposing on the memory of his life, a partial fragmentary view, which would be irreconcilable with the mighty genius he was, it will not do what they It has been suggested to me that I could sing all 114 works from his magisterial songbook. But how could my poor fluting tones rival a bliss of hearing talc perform them himself. And thanks to many, we have the tape recordings. No, a recital by me would be quite quite unendurable. How to get the measure of the man. take you on a tour through his wardrobe. Read snatches from his books, tell childhood anecdote. bluster, gabble Hold on Hold up his example, as a paragon of what it means to be a fin to be human. None of these will suffice.

So let me say this, he owed me a great deal of money. He was war allied. He knew not the difference between a hero no no more hand. He was often in his cups, that he wants referee the last hockey match. He'd never learned the rules. He did not have green fingers. Many Boyles pained him, he had a scar on his left chin. He confused the different metals. His hair was often unkempt, he set fire to Bibles. His pigs were neglected. adept at ping pong, he righted his bat. He wants suffered from scruffier. his tent had many holes. He never wore a hat. His gas bills drove him crackers. He spoke umpteen languages. His mother told me he was terrified of swans. Geology was beyond him. He hankered for doilies. He counted toads. His bath was made of 10 his first marriage was an old he could not ride a bicycle. He spat out mayonnaise. He avoided paying for hotel rooms by clamoring damn fire escapes. Once he built a bridge, he burned himself in effigy to dismantle the samovar. He loves to eat turnips. He often drooled his thumbs were deformed. He was wants to gloat. rust and rhyme engaged his attention. He was much traveled He designed his own pen nibs. He irked a private detective. his eyesight was atrocious. Candles have been lit for him. He punched an impresario. his credentials were spotless. He gutted hearts. linctus slithered down his throat. He owned dozens of fractals. He thought the moon was his friend in Bratislava. He wept. He fed flamingos with biscuit crumbs. in certain circles. His name was mud. He kept his gutta percha in a gunny sack. The site of geese made him anxious. He smoked two routes. He held off the lantern on the banks of a duck pond. His saliva was bitter. He pumped up a lie low. taxes were levied upon him. He had a zest for crumpled things. His wit was slack in parks, he pondered. He bit his fingernails, he chewed spinach or the pinch, he would talk for hours on the subject of straw. He wiped his bottom with leaves things dangling from the ceiling of his booed while he wrote a disquisition upon flies. Once he was caught with his pants down, he mumbled through a tube he lost on the horses. Finland he adored, he wrapped a tortoise in blankets. In his youth, he survived on crust. His father was a breeder of hogs. Often he behaved like a maniac. twigs and branches fell unremarked in his garden. sculling held no early or for him, he dabbed at his brow with ointments. He coaxed mice from their nooks, he loved many he was injured by a runaway bus, clods of Earth surrounded him, he could be petulant, he strained things and maszlee net he pulverized a diving board with his bare hands. Morse code baffled him. He nearly joined the Marines. He moved his arms towards the like, under a cow tower, he splintered planks. He opposed reactionaries, he overcame this data. His sheep had worms he crossed himself, he played Bagatelle he spied a crocus he fainted. He snored his stomach, his hearing aid his cuffs, his gristle has spun his batteries, his hardship is trapped me his Mint is past his windows, his calcium, his rudders, his pill word, his seeds, his nettles, his illness, autumn shipwreck curtains, banisters, remembrance exile, pandemonium, Hydros, balconies hair meat dribble, fanfares dampness, bauxite canals, Boss gage lasciviousness Muse spigots, iron catalepsy, crack bang, boom Krakatoa last talc is gone

obsequies for lost count struck by lightning. Chapter 15 the final chapter children if he had listened this far, Take heed, last talk could not have known that he carried in his pocket and bedded in his prize, a lightning conductor of superb efficiency. But you will be on your guard. You will not forget to ask papar to place an egg laid on Ascension day and a house leak plant in the rafters of your dwelling. You will not threaten Dally at the onset of a thunderstorm neglecting to throw open all the doors and windows to turn pictures to face the wall and to cover your mirrors with heavy blankets. You will not forget to wear a wreath of laurel and a necklace of coral. You will never put your shiny new boots upon the table. You will not attempt to count the twinkling stars nor point with your finger towards that part of the heavens went to lightning lightning is expected. You will not forget to gather bundles of Hazel and Willow twigs and stand them in pots of water. If you pick a puppy, you will not let a petal from it fall onto your hand. When my mom begged you to gather up the knives and forks and spoons and scissors and skies and tweezers and pencils and pins and needles and all other implements of steel and put them away in the cupboard. You will not disobey her. You will not hang back when your pals go scurrying to the churches to set tolling great clamors of bells. You will not stand near towering pines nor up to your ankles in a basin of water nor by any lead and spout iron gate railings bandstand or palisade in times of lightning will you

And there we have it, it's taken four shows and 10 minutes to get through. So either two hours. And I hope it was worth it, I enjoyed reading it again. And there's quite a likelihood that I'm gonna type out the whole thing, word for word and make it available as a booklet from the hooting yard website. So there's something for you to look forward to. And anyway, well, so we've basically we've been doing that for four weeks and in that in that time, lots of other material has cropped up on the hooting yard website. So we've got quite a lot to get through before we can catch up with with the latest doings. two particular things that I've been involved in, I've been researching two subjects in particular janitors for a forthcoming the book of janitors, which I intend to publish, which is going to be the Definitive Guide to janitor them. And I've also been investigating lobsters. crustaceans of the sea, also known as crayfish in certain circles of death and defining a lobster I have learned is quite difficult. Anyway, I've been Yes, I've been reading up on lobsters and I've been reading up on on janitors. And these came together in a poem, or no, I don't often write poems, but I wrote a proper poem. And here it is. The janitor rattles his bunch of keys. The lobster knows the secrets of the sea. That's it. I mean, I couldn't think of anything else to say. So I stopped there. I think Matt says everything that I had to say about janitors and lobsters. Other people have written poems about lobsters, including john gay, author of the Beggar's Opera, among other things, and the final. Two couplets from his 1720 verse to a young lady with some lampreys is quite quite splendid. So here it is. For when I see you without joking, your eyes, lips, breasts are so provoking. They set my heart more Kaka hoop than could whole seas of crayfish soup. So for any, any men listening next time you want to impress the lady of your dreams. Compare her beauty favorably to a bowl of soup. And I'm sure that will be good. I mean, isn't that great? You set my heart more Kaka Hooper than could haul seeds of crayfish soup. Anyway, just to test if your knowledge of lobsters is as good as my own. Here is a Here is a brief little lobster quiz for you to do. And I'll try to remember to give the answer at the end of the show, which is in a bad quarter of an hour's time. So here's the quiz. What type of lobster Am I describing? It is found in the waters of Western Samoa. It is musical. It is furry. It is magnificent. What kind of lobster is that? And the answer will be forthcoming at the end of the show.

often asked myself if I was born to bogey born to a mule and puke Yes. to scratch and Goblin preen most certainly. And in the end to kick the bucket and feed the worms or wedged in my final box ignited to blaze in glory. But in between times must die. Can I Boogie? was it written the stars spread out across the firmament in Particular alignment at the moment of my birth that I should Boogie once on a Wednesday I recall, I studied and studied a chart of those stars, but I learned nothing. Partly that was because I didn't really know what I would have been looking for, partly because the child had been dropped in a puddle and was smudged. I gazed at it for hours on that Wednesday, hoping for enlightenment of a boogie related kind. But eventually I gave up and crumpled the chart in my fist and tossed it into a dustbin. I was told also on a Wednesday, but on a different Wednesday, that to properly bougie one had to wear a bougie hat, and a shirt with bougie cuffs, and a pair of bougie shoes. But the person who told me this was unreliable in matters bougie At any rate, that he had never to the best of my knowledge, himself boogied. He just spouted off about Boogie, one of those Boogie spatters who were so tiresomely prevalent at one time. Some people feel nostalgic for that time, of course, even weak when they think of it, but not me. I couldn't give a monkey's It was another person who told me and not on a Wednesday this time, but on a Sunday, that if I wanted to witness proper bogey, I should make a beeline for the monkey house. Apparently, monkeys Boogie better than any other creature on earth. They truly were born to bougie I'm not sure this is the truth, I hope to study a chart not dissimilar to the chart of stars, but a chart of monkeys, one that had not been dropped into a puddle and smudged. But try as I might. I couldn't get my mittens on one. The whole monkey bougie business is still up in the air as far as I'm concerned. And I can't quiz the person who told me to get me heads to the monkey house. For an acquired unrelated development. He was found hanging from a bridge driver an important river, his pockets waited with stones. They said he had Boogie in his eyes at the last. But what in heaven's name that might mean I have no idea. It has been pointed out to me more than once that had I been born to Boogie, I would have Boogie by now. Well, frustum Dustin, as they say, that's a persuasive point. If I started to Boogie today, or next week or in whatever years are left to me, would there not be something forced and artificial about my Boogie I knowingness that would be fatal to the boogie itself. There again, some have posited the idea that the of the past it bougie, or the creaking wizard and Boogie as not uncommon variations on the classic bougie, which I suppose might be defined as the bougie practiced by monkeys, if indeed monkeys do actually bougie and I was not being lied to yet again. I shall recreate that smudge star chart from the dustbin and hop it down to the monkey house. And perhaps, perhaps things will become clear to me, at least in terms of bougie.

Colin tells us in his song, Suzanne, that there are heroes in the seaweed. Oh, really? I asked myself, not without a dash of skepticism. And what precisely would heroes be doing disporting themselves in the Sargassum and the bladderwrack and the kelp? Still, one does not wish to dismiss out of hand the words of a figure of such stature, so I summoned my sidekick and went to investigate. out by the aerodrome, we boarded a shower bank heading for the seashore, but not before arming ourselves, each with a long and pointy stick. These I explained to my somewhat dim sidekick we would use to poke about the seaweed In Search of Heroes. He seemed satisfied with this intelligence. But as the shower bank gathered speed, crossing the wild and windy malls, he babbled questions at me. which particular heroes were they that were to be found in the seaweed, heroes of ancient Greece, such as Hercules and Theseus and Jason and Baron bellerophon tragic heroes, such as arrestees, and either person, Hamlet, Byronic heroes, guitar heroes, boy's own paper heroes or modern day superheroes such as Batman and Spider Man and unconscious squirrel, the unconscious squirrel? Or would we find entangled in the seaweed, representatives of all these types of heroes and more? And were they trapped in the sea weed struggling heroically to escape from it? Or have they made it their natural habitat nesting in it as it were, even perhaps feeding off it? I was fairly sure Cohen had not addressed these questions in his song. But to be on the safe side, I decided to listen to it again. Pointing out with a shower bank window that a flock of starlings to distract my sidekicks attention and shut him up. I jammed into my ears, the tiny headphones have my eyelid entered, and pressed play. Precisely three minutes and 49 seconds later, I removed the headphones and turn to my sidekick, who was still staring out of the window, mouth open dribbling, though the starlings have long vanished, and the only bird visible in the sky was a lone Lark, or it might have been a swift or even an avocet. I know nothing of Ornithology. Cohen does not expand upon his assertion, I said. So we'll have to poke about with our long pointy sticks and see what we shall see. First, though, I think we're both in need of refreshments. So we shall stop at the seaside kiosk for some tea and oranges that come all the way from China. My sidekick was happy with this suggestion, and he grinned. It is never a pretty sight. So I closed my eyes. Earlier that day, I had climbed the whole mountainside to wash my eyelids in the rain, which could pass me out something awful, and no sooner when my eyes shut. Then I fell into a snooze. When I woke up the Shire bank was parked in a lay by by at the seashore. I was the only passenger still aboard. Even my sidekick had gone. I disembarked and made my way to the kiosk where I was sure I would find him stuffing his God with Chinese oranges. The Kiosk was bolted and shattered, but by following a trail of spilt tea and strips of orange peel, I soon crack down my sidekick he was squelching about in a tide pool, poking his long pointy stick into it. Have you spared any heroes? I called? No, he replied, just sculpins and Kelly fish and blennies and yellow sponge fish and sea stars and sea cucumbers and sea urchins and sand shrimps and lobsters and crabs and hermit crabs and Greenline shore crabs and barnacles and nudibranchs and Titans and mussels and scallops and abalone shells and limpets and snails. Oh, and a sea anemone. No sign at all then of orde Wingate, or Captain James T. Kirk to pluck but two heroes at random. Nope.

Frank Key  23:18
I went to sit on a slimy Boulder. It occurred to me that heroes might be more likely to swim about in the open sea, festooned with seaweed like mermaids, we would have to hire a rowing boat to extend our quest. It also occurred to me that it would be cheaper and far less tiresome to conclude that Cohen had no idea what he was talking about. Come sidekick I called throw away your long pointy stick and let us catch the shower bank home before darkness falls. And so we did, but we never reached home. For long before we reached the bus stop by the aerodrome the Sherif bank driver killed the light in a lonely lane, and an eight with Angel glands erased the final wisps of pain with the music of rubber bands.

Frank Key  24:45
We've got five minutes of the show left. So I'm gonna tell you I'm going to be really boring and tell you about two of my dreams that I had during the weeks when I was reading obstacles for last talc. So The first one was I woke up I got up a CT 10 to five in the morning. And the very first thing I did apart from the usual ablutions, etc, was to find out about so john vanbrugh the real historical so john vanbrugh 1664 to 1726, architect of Blenheim Palace, and author of the provoked wife turned out to have little in common with the so john vanbrugh date, uncertain, who appeared in the dream from which I had just woken my dream. vanbrugh was famed as a painter of chickens. And he had painted a particular type of white chicken so many times that it was known as a vanbrugh Chicken connoisseurs eagerly sought out vanbrugh Chicken paintings in auction sales rooms, where they sold for tidy sums. Wide awake, I can still see a vampire a kickin white with a red crop in my mind's eye. That just is such a thing as a vampire a chicken now, even though it's just something I dreamed, and a friend of mine who read that on the hooting yard website, also dreamed of a vanbrugh chicken. So kind of spooky, almost like a, like a mind a brain infection. And the other dream I had. This was a couple of weeks earlier. I attended as an observer, a revolutionary tribunal held in a sort of warehouse, where the members of Henry cow were arraigned before a committee of hardline Irish Maoists charged with imperialist deviation. I'm afraid to say that it was decided that Chris Cutler be taken out and shot.

Frank Key  27:19
So anyway, to finish off this week's show, you will remember that I set you about 15 or 20 minutes ago a lobster quiz. The question was as follows. What type of lobster Am I describing? It is found in the waters of Western Samoa. It is musical. It is furry. It is magnificent. So consulting your piece of paper on which you've scribbled down your answer. The correct answer is the musical furry lobster pally by ISIS magnificus. And I'm not making that up. I'll be back with you next week. We may even have further lobster facts and maybe even some further janitor facts. We'll see what we get. But anyway, that was that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And God bless you and may your God go with you or whatever it was the day valid used to say bye bye.
