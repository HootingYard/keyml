Hello and welcome to the radio station other stations don't or possibly aren't, or Anyway, my name is Frankie. This is hooting yard on the air, and you're listening to a general air of decrepitude, previously known as hooting yd on the air x resonance while 4.4 FM Of course, and Joseph k was dreaming. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you about it. Other people's dreams are almost always insufferably boring. My heart sinks when somebody I barely know insists on telling me one of their dreams. It's akin to the horror I feel when button the hole by somebody who is determined to read me their latest poem. These poems are inevitably codswallop and so it is with dreams. On the other hand, we are perhaps rightly fascinated by our own dreams, as I suppose we are by our own poems if we're foolish enough to write them. Dreams, turn up our memories, distort them, pluck them from where they belong, and drop them into new and weird context. Because they belong to us. They're endlessly interesting. We try to wring sense from them to act as our own Viennese quack and work out what the dream tells us about ourselves. Such navel gazing is very pleasing, but you really don't want to impose it on anybody else. pleasing, yes, but sometimes futile. God knows how I have wrestled with the deep deep meaning of a dream I had a few years ago, in which and this is true. In rich I attacked the actor Roy Kinnear, bashing him over their head with a care. I never met the lightness to Kinnear. It is to date his soul appearance in my dream world. I still have no idea what the dream meant, if it meant anything. We might if we're sufficiently engaged, find the dreams of fictional characters intriguing. I can't remember that particular dream Joseph Kay had in a dream by Franz Kafka, which is another reason I'm not telling you about it. But we ought to remember that fictional characters dreams aren't real dreams. They're made up by the author. They may well be based on actual dreams The author had, though there's no guarantee of that. In any case, you can bet on your sickly and wisdom to grandmother's life that the author embroiders and shapes the dream narrative through art. Consider as an example, the story in which your fictional athlete bob bennett tavole has a dream while taking a pre pole vaulting nap. As listeners we know that the dream has been planted in his fictional sleeping brain, probably by his coach, the cantankerous train smoking overcoated Homburg hat is an all too real, old Halong a non fictional character, if ever there was one. In the dream bobbin it to evolve and old Hallam have somehow swapped identities. Thus, it is the coach who is pole vaulting and image so absurd and preposterous. It's the epitome of dream Bizarro re. This is what I mean by art. Fictional athletes Bob needs to evolve. Meanwhile, in the persona of his coke has gone to visit old halabi sicne sickly and a wisdom grandmother in her hovel. He explains to her by thumps on her head that he is going to gamble on her life in a sordid wager. The grandmother then takes off her throb nightcap and is revealed to be a large fierce Wolf with gleaming and razor sharp fangs. Fictional athletes, Bob Nick devolves screens in real life this is the point where a dreamer would be shocked awake. But in the story, the dream continues. Bob net to roll, runs out of the hovel, runs and runs and finds himself on a familiar running track. He runs round and round and round in pursuit now of another runner Just ahead of him. Eventually, the fictional athlete catches up with the runner and they sprint across the finishing line at exactly the same moment. panting they turn to face each other, and Bob net tavole recognizes his fellow runner as the late actor Roy Kinnear.

Frank Key  05:19
Arm in arm they repair to the sort of supersonic milk bar, where they order a couple of sort of supersonic milk based drinks. They sit at a table. All of a sudden, the writer Frank key comes charging in and whack attacks Roy Kinnear, bashing him over the head with a chair. frightened Bob net devolve runs into a sort of supersonic milk bar pantry looking, locking the door behind him. He mops his fevered brow first taking off his Homburg. Remember, he is still in the guise of his coach, old halabi, who we assume is making up this dream. We might ask them at this point, whether the dream tells us more about fictional Bob net to roll or non fictional old hammer Bob, we might ask the question of a Viennese quack who would surely know the answer, but none is available. So instead growing bored, we ask how did the dream end? Having removed his Homburg botnet to evolve or old hollub looked down and saw that his trouser cuffs were dirty and his shoes while they stopped Brom. Bending to retire the shoe laces. He bumped his head on head bumper. So severe was the bump that stars appeared revolving around his fictional dream head as an illustration and a children's comic. They were such pretty stars. Oh, how they twinkled, enchanted by the site. He woke up. And in that case, the first sentence and the last were translated from the German by will and Edwin knew everything in between was not

Frank Key  07:27
stop drama, and actual play. I'm going to perform a play ably assisted by Miss blossom Partridge, aka pansy cradle Drew, who is with me here today. And it's a two Well, it's a one scene play. And it's based on real life. It's like a kitchen sink drama. Think think angry young men think john Osborne, that kind of thing. So, you know, theater about 60 years ago. Anyway, as I said based on real life, and it's a two hander as they Thespians call them before with bats before we perform the play, I could ask Miss blossom Partridge. How did you prepare for the role? Well,

Unknown Speaker  08:21
I spent quite a long time getting in character right? I think I did not just the character I'm playing to but but also the other character rise so that I I felt that I knew both parts

Frank Key  08:36
did you use the method? Did you live with the character for like a month before performing

Unknown Speaker  08:43
I used a method but I don't think I can discuss that without a great deal of money in the teaching contract Really?

Frank Key  08:50
Fair enough. Well, we'll speak to dr. Baxter the chief creative brains behind resonance FM and see if we can perhaps get you to do a show your acting technique anyway. And this this play is entitled overheard in a supermarket and the characters are mother played by Miss blossom Partridge, and child played by me so well, that plays the Act One, scene one.

Unknown Speaker  09:34
Oh, look tiling pigs in blankets.

Frank Key  09:38
Or don't want to throw your poor pig in a blanket. curtain.

Frank Key  09:53
That was a that was something that was something I generally genuinely overheard in a suit. A market and it made me laugh. Possibly hasn't made you laugh anyway. I'm deeply lost in the night, an overwhelming Pong of hamster and hair oil, the air swarming with nocturnal naps in the distance under the elevated section of the motorway scores of loudspeakers pounding out nonstop reggae and rock music, a night of dread. But is it nathie Nash wrote of the terrors of the night and there was nothing nasty about them, or nathie Oh, sweep away the swarms or disperse them with us with a blast from a bicycle pump. Imagine if Lee Harvey Oswald had been armed with a bicycle pump rather than with a man like a car car, no snipers rifle. He was unable to drive so it's plausible he could have had a bicycle and that's a pump. Imagining such a thing such twaddle distracts from the dread and the terror on this night of nights. This night of no owls, Where have they gone? The yew trees branches are now empty and of our world for the first time in living memory. Remember studying them through night vision TRY NOT killers, the mystic third lens for the mystic Third Eye invaluable goggles. night came crashing down so suddenly, up there fat stars glistened, unimaginably distant burning rocks. Down here hopelessly lost. Magnets ceasing to function. compass is pointing in unknown directions, never previously seen on Earth. In tenebrous gloom, trying to decipher the scritti mark and Mark underfoot, approaching the Ducal potting shed behind airy shrubs, someone must be there. The first sentence in the last word translated from the German by Tanya and James stern. Everything in between was not.

Frank Key  12:55
JOHN and I were just discussing, because he's usually very good at spotting the planted quotes from post punk singles imbedded in my story sometimes for our listeners who care about such things. Remind underneath the elevated section of the motorway schools of loudspeakers were pounding out non stop reggae and rock music is from one of the pieces I can't remember the title. spag Bo won't notice. But it's from the first squishy policy single skank Bob belanja one of the songs on the other side and please if you if you hear the word scritti poverty and your heart sinks as mine tends to do when I think of those awful records they made you do have to listen to the first three records that they might I've got that absolutely stuck in my head No, no, no. That should not have been allowed. They're one of their they're a great example of one of those groups who were absolutely brilliant. And then absolutely must it completely and mate what I mean would be what's that all about? anyway? The final straw for me tonight something the the worst thing was the sweetest girl that was when the rock setting what you have to do is listen to everything before that when they were absolutely brilliant.

Unknown Speaker  14:38
Yes here that the French had this great saying which is either no or no Muto, which means let us return to our sheep. Right. It's perfect for when we get

Frank Key  14:54
Oh, I see. Yes. off topic. Right. Well, we're gonna get back on topic now. Because pansy cradle Jew, aka Miss blossom Partridge is going to read to us something that was written in the new in in the church magazine around the time of the coronation of the king in 1937. No, it was published in 1937. Anyway, this is from sometime around the coronation of one of the predecessors of the queen and in the church magazine. I said this

Unknown Speaker  15:46
we say quite frankly that any man who doesn't come to church and say his prayers at the coronation has the intellect of a rabbit and the emotions of a caterpillar

Frank Key  16:17
the intellect of a rabbit and the emotions of a caterpillar. That's me. Right, I'm gonna get a grip now. It looks as if much had been neglected in our country's system of defense. Yes, fought hoity is famously impregnable, and fought toity likewise. But the fence linking them

Frank Key  16:47
excuse me a moment, I have to get back in the zone. I'm going to begin that entire piece again. It looks as if Mark had been neglected in our country's system of defense. Yes, Fort hoity is famously impregnable, and fought toity likewise. But the fence linking them running along the frontier had been constructed from balsa wood and lollipop sticks. And when the swarm of specially trained border wasps was wiped out by Herbert Courtney disease, otherwise known as border wasp, Wipeout syndrome, the flimsiness of the fence became all too apparent. Our neighbors are ferocious and barbaric. Night after night on the other side of the fence, like bonfires and dancing circles around them, screaming impious guttural cries and waving pitchforks by unfathomably stupid. To date they have been kept at bay by the puppy and mash a wasps gummed to lollipop sticks at regular intervals along the frontier. The effectiveness of this defensive measure is unlikely to last. The Puppet wasps cannot withstand torrential rainfall of which there is much intolerance and our factories cannot turn out sufficient replacements because of the shortages from Fort hoity as also from Fort toity. We take Snipes at our barbarian foe by launching snipe at them. For those of you who know little or nothing about flying things with wings and beaks and feathers. The snipe is a type of bird. It has a long, sharp pointy bill or beak see previous sentence. Our snipers are specially trained to sweep relentlessly towards barbarians and to pass them with their point he beat ideally puncturing one of the major arteries. Note that as we've sheep and tail, the plural of snipe is snipe I do not know why that is the case. Ask An ortho linguist why one drawback of our sniping is that for all were savagery, our neighbors seem to have a way with birds. The original idea was that having stabbed and slain a barbarian the sniper would turn round and fly back to Fort hoity otter fort toity, ready to be relaunched for another attack, but the barbarians cross it the snipe and feed the millet and tiny terrified mammals and make pets of them and maddeningly, the snipe thrive in their care. We are fortunate that thus far, the savages have not yet worked out how to get the snipe to attack us. One of our brightest engineers has devised a plan to dig a ha ha along the length of the fence between 40 and 40 toity. Plus, if the barbarians did manage to breach the balsa wood and lollipop sticks and Pappy and mash a wasps, they will immediately topple into the haha. They would be trapped like sitting ducks, and our forces could then make short work of them by dropping in a massive violence and other flowers, smothering them as Helio gabicce did his enemies. Before we can put this plan into action, we need to convert much of our farmland into plantations for violence and other flowers, so we have enough for the smothering. Meanwhile, our black ops team conducts various Black Ops on both sides of the border. by their nature, Black Ops are carried out under the radar. As we do not have a radar. We fashioned a convincing counterfeit by attaching a couple of wire coat hangers to the top of a lamppost near Fort hoity and another one near Fort toity. So pig ignorant and backward are the barbarians. They're completely taken in. baffled by our superior technology. They think a coat hanger is the work of the devil, and that is when it is used for its original purpose as a foe radar. They think it is the work of two devils.

Frank Key  21:29
threatened as we all buy boots on the border, there is perhaps a greater peril lurking in our midst. I speak of the enemy within the peaceniks by our growing in number in spite of our efficient secret police and the Friday night head boy rings both fought it and fought toity. These useful idiots deny that our neighbors are barbaric savages who wish us harm, insisting rather that they are lovely people who just grunt rather more than we do. Look how they care for this snipe these nitwits cry, ignoring the fact that they are our snipe primed to kill and treacherously bought off by the barbarians with millet and tiny, terrified mammals. of equal concern to the authorities is the fashionable theory currently being bruited about the cement water troughs of our foam boards. But there is no land at all on the other side of the fence. No barbarians, just the sea, the vast wet illimitable sea that stretches forever to the ends of the earth. Proponents of this code will maintain that the bonfires great we see our strange inexplicable atmospheric phenomena that the barbarians dancing in circles around them screaming MPs, guttural cries and waving pitchforks. Amir, see sprites phantoms of wind and water and the play of the light. This is a misunderstanding of some kind, and it will be the ruin of us. I mean, that piece the first sentence and the last word translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Moore, and everything in between was not

Frank Key  23:56
and to end this week, blossom and I would like to sing absolute by security policy. No, we wouldn't. That was that was a very, very bad drug. You wouldn't want to hear that. What we're gonna do instead is we're gonna take turns reading a piece from the book of gaff called in gas. And it goes like this. And below that came on to gas and man whose head was as the head of the author

Unknown Speaker  24:32
and his body also was as the form of the author, and likewise his dimension.

Frank Key  24:39
And when the man spike, his voice was as the cry of the otter.

Unknown Speaker  24:44
Now the people of gaff seeing this were much afraid.

Frank Key  24:50
If I gathered about the man with their pointy sticks and read him onto their high row fant.

Unknown Speaker  24:56
Now the Hierophant of gas dwelt in a place Much mist and vaporous, sness and yielding.

Frank Key  25:05
And the people said, Oh hi ro fan of gas. We bring you this man in form like I'm to the otter, what shall we do with him?

Unknown Speaker  25:15
And with his mouth, the Hierophant of gaff spoke mumbo jumbo unto them, and they lay down their pointy sticks and return to their father's fields, where many tears were sown.

Frank Key  25:32
And he took the man like until the otter into his house in the midst.

Unknown Speaker  25:38
And the next day, there came tidings of the Hindenburg disaster.

Frank Key  25:57
Five minutes for last I'm gonna say if I've got time to read this to you. Um, no, I haven't really, I think what we'll do instead is find some shorter, potted, brief, brief lives. which often useful. Oh, no, I know what No, I just realized. I've just realized I'm really not with it this week. Anyway, I just realized that as a new as a new poetry book by Dennis Pierpont has just been published. Lovely new poems by Dennis Pierpont, and it's entitled feather footed, through the flashy fan Islamic Cultural Center passes the questing, Vol. And one of the poems in the book, I'd like to read to you now. I would like to read it to you. Perhaps. Miss blossom. You could talk about knitting for a minute. While I while I find it.

Unknown Speaker  27:06
Yes, yes, I do think well, rather than knitting perhaps we should talk about poetry. There's there's been quite a lot of poetry floating around at hooting yard recently. And it's interesting that Dennis beer pint should be putting together this collection at this point, because obviously, he's got a lot of material to choose from. And I think he's ready.

Frank Key  27:33
Yes. He's ready. He's on a journey. He's on a journey on a journey. JOHN, how are you?

Unknown Speaker  27:42
Wow.

Frank Key  27:43
Okay, good. All right. Well, to end this week show then here's a new poem by Dennis Pierpont from his new collection. Feather floating through the flashy fan Islamic Cultural Center passes the questing roll. I sprawled in the mosque and I thought about Allah. Did he I wonder ever visit Valhalla? Would the Vikings have allowed him to enter and make it an Islamic Cultural Center? Or would they have smoked him with x and bludgeon violence in their Nordic dungeon? There is only one true God. Requiem aeternam Donna a. Ken Dodd.

Frank Key  28:43
That is the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And this blossom part do you think someone might write into complain about that poem? I can't think who or why would do that a Viking bat?

Unknown Speaker  29:02
I don't know.

Frank Key  29:03
Anyway, I'll be back next week. I may or may not have Miss blossom Partridge with me. I don't know. But I'm sure you've enjoyed having her on the show. And sorry to keep mentioning scritti politically, I know that can't be easy for you. Bye bye.
