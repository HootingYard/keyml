Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. It's the fourth of June 2015. And it's 6pm here in London. For a long time I used to go to bed early. I was exhausted from long days working as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. There are those who think that being a janitor is an easy life, little more than a matter of rattling a set of keys swashing a mop along the corridor or floor and glaring reproachfully at all who pass by. There may be janitors of that kidney, but I was not that kind of janitor and never had been neither in this nor in any of my earlier janitor shifts. It's a curious fact that the buildings in which I have been a janitor of all housed milk related activities. Before being appointed to my post in the evaporated milk factory, I worked at a condensed milk canning plant, a milk of magnesia research Research Laboratory and the milk slots swapping tank. When I was younger, I lacked application and was frequently reprimanded on a carpet, as is usually the case by my superiors. The overseer of the slop age tank was particularly rancorous as I recall, but by the time I fetched up at the evaporated milk factory, I took my duty seriously, excessively so and that was why I was exhausted at the end of the day. To be precise, I was exhausted before the end of the day, hence my going to bed early. There is a pamphlet by Dobson entitled tips for janitors out of print, which helped to mend my ways. On a boiling hot summer Sunday, at a loose end, I went to visit a dying janitor in a Mercy Home. his brow was beautiful and his jaw was lanten and he was slowly perishing from a malady which had set in after an attack of the bindings, and which he could not shake off. Due to his advanced age. It was not entirely clear how old he was, for his birth certificate had been destroyed by worms. He certainly looked under the unbelievably ancient when I went to see him on that boiling day. propped up in a sort of collapsible med medical chair, surrounded by dripping foliage like general stern would in the Big Sleep. He had made a vain attempt to mask his decrepitude by dyeing his hair black with boot polish, and by sporting the type of T shirt worn by young Japanese trendies. Neither ploy for me. I knew I was looking at a janitor who had began his career in the age of gas, mantle's and steam. My visit was prompted by a plea from the charitable charitable board for janitors close to death, seeking volunteers to pay social calls on janitors close to death. To brighten their last days, I thought myself to lagu breus to be suitable for such a good date. But the board's director, an ex flapper by the name of Minzy henbane said that this particular dying janitor rejoiced in the lagu breus and few near real and bleak and that my presence would lift his spirit. Like the Italian castrato opera singer Luigi marquese 1754 to 1829, who, irrespective of the party was playing, insisted on making his stage entrances on horseback wearing a helmet with white feathers several feet long. I like to cut something of a dash when entering a Mercy Home.

On this particular Sunday, I was in smothered in fine kingley rayment complete with the pelt of a Wolverine gulo gulo, the largest land dwelling member of the weasel family, a burnished golden helmet marquese would have died four and a bobble or two. It was stiflingly hot, of course, but my blood is ice cold. And I had achieved a temperate equilibrium. As I strode majestically into the greenhouse, where in the dying janitor awaited me. I'm unable to tell you his name, not because I do not know it, but because I found it completely unpronounceable. He was of tan tower been parentage, and bought one of those impossible, and I must say foolish names they're so fond of in that land. He was also wearing a pair of dentures, which had been designed for a mouth much larger than his. So it was not only his name, I failed to catch. I had brought with me as a gift, a bag of extra crunchy, hard, crunchy herbal crackers. And it looked to me as if those gigantic teeth would be more than a match for their crunchiness. Indeed, they were for a few minutes as the dying janitor shoveled the crackers gratefully into his gob. It was like being in a hot, damp greenhouse with a snapping turtle. He crunched his way through the whole bag full so rapidly, that I wondered if he was ever fed. I had not seen any staff in the Mersey home, not even a janitor. In fact, I had not seen any other patients. There were some pigs in a sty between the greenhouse and the main building. But otherwise the place seemed deserted. One of the things I've always liked about people from tan Tara bin is that they're so easy to rub along with. After he had sculpted crackers. The dying janitor sat there smiling weekly, but I supposed contentedly while I roomed above him, but Greenbrier send few nariyal and bleak, just as Mimsy henbane had suggested. I decided to stay until his smile faded, and propped myself against a pane of glass, having first visited the dying Janet. Sorry, having first twisted the dying janitors neck round slightly, so I was still within his sight. It felt good to be doing something selfless for one who had trodden the path of janitor done before me. I wondered if this was what being a Boy Scout was all about. My only connection with the toggled tribe had been a single incident in the year of the Tet offensive. When I failed to stop a snack bar hooligan pushing a puny Boy Scout into a lake. I would have intervened, but I was too preoccupied at the time with recalibrating a mechanism, one of my leisure pursuits in the days when I was an indolent janitor, rather than the indefatigable one, I became at the evaporated milk factory when I no longer had time, nor energy for leisure pursuits of any kind. Despite his penis, the boy scout had passable swimming skills, and he managed to avoid drowning in the lake, a lake in which many had met a watery death. I knew this because their names were inscribed on a plaque affixed to a post at the edge of the lake. And I had bashed the post into the mud myself with a hammer one day many years before when I have nothing else to do. I used to roam the lakes and ponds, and there abouts with my hammer, looking for posts to bash into the muck. If I could not find any post, I became dis contoured and squatted on the nearest available tasik sobbing until it was time to wend my way home. I had plenty of time to dwell upon my past, as I leaned against the pane of glass in the hot greenhouse for the dying janitors smile never wavered. It seemed that he was so pleased with the crackers With my le goobers presence, that he had entered a state of transcendent bliss. I was determined, however, to keep to my plan of staying with him until he was no longer smiling.

I knew Mimsy henbane would approve. And in a sense it was also a way of a swaging the guilt I still felt about failing to prevent the snack bar hooligan shoving that puny Boy Scout into the lake. that had happened many years before, as I have indicated, but as time passed, my conscience gnawed at me with ever increasing ferocity. In those days, far from going to bed early, I often never went to bed at all, instead, marching up and down countryside lanes all night incapable of sleep. I was keeping the same hours as ours, and if nothing else, that fraught Insomniac period helped me to extend my own theological education. If I was a pamphleteer like Dobson, rather than a janitor, I'm sure I could churn out innumerable essays on owls and other nocturnal birds. As it is, I make do by buttonholing, the occasional evaporated milk factory employee and sharing my bird learning with them, whether they like it or not. It was a pity that the dying janitor was from tantaran and wearing dentures far too big for his mouth. And that would have been unintelligible to me, where he to be prodded into speech, for there was something in his demeanor, which told me that he like me, was an erudite janitor. I would not guess what his area of expertise was, of course, so I made a mental note to ask Minzy henbane when next I called into the charitable board for janitors close to death HQ. mean Z's journey from flapper to charitable board director was an extraordinary one. Her story has inspired poets, novelists, composers, filmmakers, and creative Titans in just about any field you can think of. Not least the designers of T shirt worn by young Japanese trendies. Dennis beer pied wrote a series of cantos about her. Anthony Burgess struggled for years with a novel based on her life, but was forced to abandon it when he concluded that such a work was beyond his imaginative powers. an opera booth by Booth was inspired by her. Dan Brown is apparently working on a pop boiler called the Mimsy henbane code. Before his untimely death, Raina van Fassbinder penned plan to film about her set in a tough foreign dockyard full of rough homosexual sailors. The list goes on. Yet intriguingly, not one of the works based on her life ever addressed the root of her devotion to Janet as close to death. There is always plenty about her flapper hood, and about the Antarctic Expedition, the beekeeping, the shipwreck, the surgical interventions, the gladsome, the spring, and the buffet of autumn, the postage stamp mystery, the years of crime, the gutta percha interlude, the bittersweet romances, the collapsed lung, the other collapsed lung, the delicate little fist, beating hopelessly against wooden panels in the heart in the forest, the evil chickens, the gaudy Buddha, the Karen Carpenter incident, the vandalism, the scuba diving, the pitfalls, the obelisk, the gravel pathways, the euphonium band, The pint of milk, and the gruesome business in the tough foreign dockyard full of rough homosexual sailors. Yet as janitors dying or otherwise not one word, I know because I checked, before I started working myself to exhaustion in the evaporated milk factory, I was able to spend some of my leisure time making a thorough study of all the Mimsy henbane related books and films and plays and Opera booths, and trendy Japanese t shirt, etc. From beer pod to Burgess from booth to Brown, no creative Titan deems janitors worthy of a mention. I try not to take this personally

and deny that I have poked pins into miniature wax ever dreamed of Any of those named or have any have or have any others, such as Harrison Birtwistle and Salman Rushdie and the paperback is pebble head during spooky midnight ceremonies where I have been joined by jabbering chanting, hooded, blood soaked, wild eyed, whirling, drooling, drugged up maniacs. In any case, whatever lagu breus dismay I may feel towards those who have ignored my profession is more than outweighed by the fact that Mimsy henbane herself, devoted her latter years to my kind. And she did so selflessly, apart from the excessive fees charged to those lucky enough to find a haven in one of her mercy homes, or in one of the greenhouses next to the pig size. In one of her mercy homes, and the extra charges she levied on the relics of those janitors who dying died and passed into the realms of which we know not. So despite my hours of study, I am as clueless as the next janitor as to Menzies motives. All I know is that she fully deserved my gratitude, and that is why I stood leaning against a pane of glass in that greenhouse, while a dying janitor propped up in a collapsible medical chair, his hair slathered in boot polish, and his dentures too big for his mouth, smiled at me for three whole days. I did it for Minzy I think what what the smile off his face at last was that he felt pangs of hunger for more crackers. he mumbled something at me in that weird, impossible tan terrible accent and pointed a bony finger at the empty cracker bag he had dropped on the floor. I told him, I would go to old mar purgatives clifftop superstore a lengthy hike away to get another bag full. I wondered if he would still be alive when I returned. As I turned to sweep out of the greenhouse, as dramatically as I had entered in my kingley rayment. He rummaged in a little wooden cupboard next day, his chair, took out the Dobson pamphlet tips for janitors, and pressed it into my greedily outstretched hands.

Over the next few days as I made my slowly goo breus, fue nariyal bleak way towards the coast and the clifftop, I stopped from time to time to sprawl on bright summertime lawns, and I read out and I read the out of print pamphlet from cover to cover. When I had finished it, I started again from the beginning. I was thunderstruck, in spite of my various milk related janitorial posts, I felt I was reading about an entirely new a different calling, one of which I was profoundly ignorant. Between them, the dying janitor and Mimsy henbane. A Dobson changed my life. Eager as I was to become a reborn janitor at the earliest opportunity. I was mindful of my promise to the dying janitor in the greenhouse next to the pigsty. I had made him so happy with that bag of extra crunchy, hard crunchy herbal crackers, and had vowed to fetch him another bag torn between duty and desire. I spent a miserable morning sobbing on the tasik then fortune smiled upon me, just as the dying janitor done by sending into my path, a Boy Scout as puny as the one who years before I had seen pushed into a like by a snack bar hooligan. The child appeared at the side of my tasik and inquired if I had a job for him to do in exchange for a shilling. I took his coinage and sent him off towards our mar purgatives clifftop superstore, having armed him with full instructions and a map and his shilling back to pay for the crackers. Then I turned my face towards pointy town, and headed for the evaporated milk factory and a new life.

That was about a janitor. This isn't. When considering Borneo, it's extremely important to differentiate between the wild man of Borneo and the wild men of Borneo. The first thing to grasp is that the wild man of Borneo was not one of the wild men of Borneo. Obviously, he was a wild man. And thus if one lumps together indiscriminately all the wild men of Borneo, then one is forced to conceive that the wild man of Borneo was in the round one among the wild men of Borneo. But in another respect, and one that's critical, as we shall see, the wild man of Borneo was not by any stretch of the imagination, one of the wild man of Borneo. A second point of utmost importance is to bear in mind that neither the wild man of Borneo nor the wild man of Borneo have any connection whatsoever apart from the nominative, with Borneo. All three, for there was but one wild man of Borneo, obviously and less obviously, two wild men of Borneo. All three were citizens of the United States of America. The wild man of Borneo was originally German, and arrived in the United States as a teenager, while the wild men of Borneo were natives, the one born in New York and the other in Ohio. To be absolutely clear, I ought to confess that in the foregoing I have written chronologically Kim can, putting the wild man of Borneo before the wild man of Borneo. In truth, the wild man of Borneo, sorry, in truth, the wild man of Borneo, born in 1825, and 1827 precede the wild man of Borneo, born in 1862. We can perhaps better distinguish the wild man of Borneo from the wild man of Borneo by lodging their given names in our heads. The Wild men of Borneo were Hiram W. Davis, and his younger brother, Barney Davis. The wild man of Borneo was Leonard bought chart. Without wishing to complicate things further, it is well worth noting that the latter, the wild man of Borneo, was commonly known as loosey goosey. He acquired this sobriquet from his habit, when covered in tar and horsehair and locked in a cage and federal meet. of uttering a fierce cry of booth de goof D. Neither of the wild men of Borneo is ever recorded as having used these words, if words is what they are. The Wild men of Borneo were noted rather for their prodigious feats of strength, wrestling skills, and what used to be called mental imbecility. Having digested all of the above, we should be able with confidence to tell the wild men of Borneo from the wild man of Borneo equally helpful, if not more, so, is the knowledge that next time we disembark from a boat, its sales billowing in the Southeast Asian wind upon the shores of Borneo. Should we then encounter any wild men, though they may be in Juba tably wild men of Borneo given their wildness and location, they will be neither the wild man of Borneo, nor the wild man of Borneo, with all three of whom we are now. Service I believe familiar. It would be interesting to know if either the wild man of Borneo or the wild man of Borneo had a familiar in the sense of a grim Malkin or witches familiar. I do not think any of them did but I would not wish to pronounce upon this definitively without learning more much, much more about both the wild man of Borneo and the wild man of Borneo.

All of that was absolutely true By the way, as is this grabber had an afterlife, be winged upon a cloud plucking sweetly at a harp. That at least was his dream from which he awoke tense and troubled in his cell. He was a lifer, convicted years before of murder most foul, are there he often wondered, less foul murders for which his sentence would have been commensurately less than life. He read up on the law, but nothing launched too long in his head for he was easily distracted. It came as a surprise to him. How many distractions could occur to a lifer in his cell? The sheen of the buttons on his stripy tunic, a stain upon the ceiling and an scuffling across the floor. buzzers buzzing and bells clanging somewhere far off. From his window. He watched clouds scattered across the sky. clouds that prompted his dreams of an afterlife in heaven. Oh, grabber grabber What has that done? He could no longer remember the foul deed committed in his cups after a night on the tiles, cups and tiles. They could be suits in an old tarot deck along with whisks and arrows. They used to be arrows on his tunic, but one day they came and gave him a new tunic with stripes. They did not explain why they never explained anything to grabber they gave him his food in a bowl. It was while scoffing his food one day that grabber felt amusing about Little Miss Muffet. She sat famously upon a tuffet Eating her curds and whey now grabber found this distinctly curious curds, and more especially why would like not be served in a bowl as his food was? Why then did a Little Miss Muffet? Take her bowl from the serving hatch all the way outside towards the tuffet where she sat Why did you not remain indoors as grabber did grabber had no choice in the matter of course, but he felt sure that in Little Miss Muffet circumstances, he would take his seat in the canteen rather than prance outside into the field in search of a tuffet. Her behavior made no sense to him. Grab a thought to about other characters, little jack Horner and Mary Mary Quite Contrary, and Rumpelstiltskin and Henry Kissinger, among others. These thoughts went nowhere and grabber never reached any conclusions. He lay flat on his back in his iron cot and the days past. Oh, grabber grabber, every hair on your head has been counted. He wants to try to count his own hair, which he allowed to grow long but one day without explanation. The prison barber came into his cell and hacked away his tresses. It was the same day they swapped his tunic. There was something else of significance that happened on that day, but it was no luck, but he no longer remembered what he kept no journal having no pencil. He had requested a pencil once and begin and been given a cushion. It was a tiny cushion filled with straw. The straw still smelled of the farmyard and caused grab a flight of reverie. By the confusing flights, they had never set foot on a farm. The closest he had come with a village green, where he roamed in his cups after a night on the tiles and took a break to the head of a mendicant sleeping and then to the horse trough in the moonlit night. He took that brick to the mendicant head 2030 times in an inbred frenzy. Oh grab a grabber and do what thou has done. But it could not be undone it can never be undone. Only the buttons on his stripey tunic can be undone. That grabber does not undo them. For if he did, he would only button them up again. Life with buttons and that's the end of this week.
