Good evening. This is resonance while I 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. At the end of last week, I appeared, I did a little spot at the Greenwich Book Festival, the inaugural Greenwich Book Festival in Greenwich. In a tent, and I was sharing the bill with a couple of other people we could think together, one of whom was stru at home, great screw at home. An author whose works are so filthy, that barely a single sentence is suitable for broadcasting on the air, which is probably why you've never heard Stewart on resonance. Anyway, and one of one of the things screw at home Mike's to do when he reads his work to a live audience is do so standing on his head. And I thought this was a superb idea. It looked very good, and very impressive. So I decided to take a leaf out of Stewart's book, and do this week show standing on my head. So I've been standing on my head since about 30 seconds before the theme music. And I will be continuing to stand on my head for the duration of the show. Yes, and with through the magic of radio. Unfortunately, you're unable to see that. But I can assure you it's true. Wish me luck with the next 28 minutes or so because I'll need it. It's a very interesting view of the thieving from here. Anyway. I'll read an article in a newspaper about tiny lethal phantasmal poison frogs. And I was reminded of Dobson's pamphlet, my terrifying encounter with a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog out of print. It is by any measure one of the most exciting works. One of his most exciting worked guaranteed to have one panting for breath and to call beads of sweat to break out upon the brow. This is due to the pamphleteer deploying, as he so rarely did his remarkable ability for building suspense. alerted by the title, we are in a state of heightened expectation for the appearance of the mind miniscule killer, so tiny yet so toxic. But Dobson is in no hurry to come face to face with the lethal frog. He begins by recounting in exasperating detail how in preparing for a morning crowd along the towpath of the old canal. He discovered that the aglets on his batavian crime busters boots had become rusted and brittle. The boot laces fraying as a result, reluctant to Don a different pair of boots. For reasons he enumerates over three pages. Dobson describes his search in drawers and cupboards and hidey holes were a replacement pair of boot laces throughout this, quote, desperate fossicking unquote, as he called it, marigold tube is staring out of the window at the incessant rainfall, picking out a tune on her semester, composing in her head. The words of the song that would like to be known as The Ballad of incessant rainfall. And his monograph on Dobson's various items of footwear. Aloysius nesting bird asked why the pamphleteer did not simply remove the laces from one of his other pairs of boots and reuse them when it became obvious that he had no pristine boot laces to hand. The answers his own question by delving into Dobson's infamous pamphlet. Every lace has its own boot, out of print, but work which collapse in excruciating detail, the unfathomable depth of the pamphleteers neurosis in these matters. Those

of us who have read our nesting bird will have his commentary in the back of our mind, as we follow Dobson crashing about the house on his futile search 20 pages in we're no closer to our own encounter with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, but the tension is becoming unbearable. At the point where Dobson described ripping at the point where Dobson describes clipping out onto the floor. The contents of a battered cardboard box kept under the kitchen sink. We are ready to put the pamphlet aside and to put the kettle on for a common cup of tea. Next, we take a nap and when we return to the pamphlet, we find that is what Dobson did to giving up hope of finding new boot laces for his batavian crime busters boots, and leaving marigold tube clinking and musing and staring out of the window. The pamphleteer retired to his nap hub. Now he cranks up the suspense by treating the reader to a detailed account of his period of unconsciousness, accompanied by masterly if somewhat florid descriptions of his pillows, his cover met, and his mattress. nesting birders remarked that, quote, no one has ever written about the nap as brilliantly as Dobson. The only one that is that he never devoted an entire pamphlet to the subject. Unquote. This is uncharacteristically careless of nesting bird, who was overlooked the mid period pamphlet 50 pages of prose about daytime naps in theory and practice, out of print. It says an inexplicable lapse on the part of the greatest of Dobson list, one I am minded to attribute to his habit in later years of mountain mock cloth, Bish, Bosh, flossy flapping. So we're put on tenterhooks still awaiting the terrifying encounter with the tiny, lethal phantasmal poisoned frog wondering if perhaps, when Dobson wakes from his nap, it will be to find the diminutive assassin perched within his Buffon But no, he wakes, He grants he stumbles to his s greatwall and begins scribbling. What we now come upon is not the fatal frog, but one of the central mysteries of Dobson is scholarship. This is what the pamphleteer tells us. I woke I granted, I stumbled to my escrow twang, and thereupon scribbled 10 pages of mighty prose, putting the finishing touches to my pamphlet, six more lectures on fruit. The puzzle is that no such pamphlet exists. Given the importance within the canon of the original six lectures on fruit out of print. It seems barely credible that Dobson could have completed a sequel, only to destroy it so utterly, that Not a trace remained. As nesting bird has demonstrated, though, the pamphleteer wrote innumerable fragments and scraps and unfinished doodles. Whenever he considered a work complete, he invariably published it, including the stuff that can only be described as bollocks. That is nesting birds word, not mine. There is no other reference anywhere to this pamphlet, and in fact, marigold qu in the late interview, directly denied its existence. Everything Dobson had to say about fruit she said into a tape recorder is contained in the six lectures. The very idea that any further essays could have been wrung out of his brain is preposterous. He simply didn't know enough about fruit. As with all of marigold tos tape recorded pronouncements, this has the ring of truth, and it's backed up by the remarks of the pointy town fruit or a cigarettes Mondo fig or plum tree, who recalled that Dobson used to stand in front of his market stall fruit display, scratching his head and wearing an entirely vacant expression for hours upon end, on many a market day morning. As if that were not evidence enough We have the famous incident when the pamphleteer took part in a charity fruit quiz on the radio and failed to answer a single question correctly.

My own theory about this perplexing mystery is that Dobson is deliberately pulling the wool over our eyes. by claiming to have written a pamphlet for which no credible evidence exists. He guesses rightly that our bafflement will be sufficient to make us forget all about the tiny, lethal phantasmal poisoned frog, at least temporarily, so causing us greater terror and alarm when he reminds us about it. A few pages later. It is an inspired display of narrative fireworks. Here is how he makes our hearts thump. Having Pat, having talked to the final full stop on my majestic fruit sequel, I decided to go trudging along the canal towpath in the incessant downpour downpour after all, I determined to wear my Latvian civic cavalry boots instead of the batavian crime busters boots. For the laces in the former were I knew in tip top condition. Earlier in the week, I had run them through a pneumatic bootleg testing contraption hired from Huberman it was worth every penny. Though, when the time came to return the machine to that most gorgeous of department stores. I admit I shed a few tears. As I trundle this along the way in a top my cart. I wondered if I would ever be able to afford to buy one of my own. Then all my boot lace problems would vanish in the ether packs I thought as I rounded the sordid duck pond. If I could write a pamphlet that would outsell a pebble head paperback. I might. Oh Hang on. I'm forgetting myself. You will want to know about my terrifying encounter with a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog.

Allah wishes nesting Bode rightly numbers this is among the top 100 paragraphs ever committed to paper by the out of print pamphleteer. Yet even after this Dobson continues to twist the knife. It seems the suspense could not be brought to a higher pitch. But it is I have read the pamphlet 1000 times studied it, subjecting the text to the most abstruse critical scrutiny and even discuss it even disgusted with frightening continental literary critics, all homerun spectacles and atrocious beards and Zhu tines and arrogant hand gestures. But still, I cannot work out how he does it. No sooner has he reminded us of the tiny toxic at Petco dough bait with which he is destined to come terrifyingly face to face. Then he postpones the awful moment by spending dozens of pages Wittering on about other types of poison dart frog, frogs in general, toads, green things, things with wings, things with legs, tiny beings, poisonous beings, radium beings, Ecuadorian and Andean life forms, and weirdly, the Flemish painter duck boot. Now we're unable to let the imminent encounter slip from our mind. There is no relief from the tension. Dobson's ability to shoehorn boots into his frog nightmare is sheer genius. If the reader manages to get through all this without swooning or just dropping dead, it's a capital idea to toss the time for the decide and put the kettle back on. Or if there is a dog in the vicinity to take it for a walk and let it off its leash, when one reaches an expansive green sward and throw the stick for it to fetch repeatedly. And then perhaps to head to a pond and take from one's pocket the paper bag of style breadcrumbs one has brought with one and track the crust, one by one into the pond as nutriment for ducks, if there are ducks in the pond, or swans. If there are swans and unleash the dog again and allow it to leap fiscally into the pond for a swim. If the bylaws permit the swimming of dogs in the pond, Van on the way home, pop into the orphanage to distribute arms, and perhaps have the dog leave the dog there to serve as the orphans pet. Unless the orphanage is in a designated risk a rabies zone in which case Skippy or practice or whatever the dog is Old will have to be returned to wherever it was one gathered it from outside the post office perhaps, or the dog pound. And then as one skipped slightly along the path towards one's door becomed becomes one will be both physically and mentally prepared to face the final, final hideous revelation of the Dobson pamphlet. The encounter so long threatened with the tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog of the title. So once safely back in the parlor, first quenched by that nice cup of tea, one can fling oneself into one's armchair, Allah Nayland Smith, in the fool man crew books of sacks, Roma, and in hands no longer shaking with fear, pick up the pamphlet and read. And then as I crept from the wreckage of the airplane onto an Andean smoke, so incredibly high above sea level, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. It was tiny, it was lethal. It was phantasmal it was poisonous. It was a tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog. I was transfixed with terror, my whole body stiffen, as if I were a piece of timber. The slopes of the Andes are steep. So immediately, I began to roll downhill, just as a piece of timber wood as I rolled, so the distance grew between me and the tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog until I could no longer see it. By the time I came to rest, at the foot of that Andean slope, I was no longer paralyzed with fear. The tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog was far, far above me now in the thin air,

and it was so tiny. I calculated that even hopping as frantically as it could, I would be long gone before it reached sea level. I stood up in Ecuador, and walked away from the mountain delivered from peril, sound of limb naam of brain writer of pamphlets.

He was a man of part. He was a slobbering and syphilitic whoremonger, who could yet charm the birds from the sky, often when leaning against a mantel piece at a swish cocktail party. Like Eric Saffy, he likes to eat sausages and camphor. His neck movements were sometimes like those of a vulture and sometimes like those of the sadly extinct giant short faced bear. When out and about on his so called patrols. He usually wore a crushed Crimplene cravat, and the super abundance of brazen jet cufflinks, each one of which he polished vigorously with swore fieger the distribution of so many unnecessary cufflinks about his person was a wonder to behold and was regularly remarked upon by fashion mavens, but never copied when he wore a hat, he wore it with a chain linking it to a sturdy ring bolted to the back of his neck, and he wore it with a clap. He sucked on spangles of many flavors. So the thing out of a dental vise through a side door, slinking with surprising elegance along our night alley thick with the leavings of debauchery. he whistled, oh Danny Boy, attracting the attention of police officers threatened with truncheons and prosecution, he turned upon those who would do him harm or battle risks there and face them down. Magnificent in his imperiousness. His slobbering has increased as he grew older, and he collected them when he could into a 10 spittle basin, and left it out on his porch at night where rainfall diluted the slobbering, and the morning you diluted them further, and during his morning patrol, he pulled them into a pond. You could cut yourself on the creases in his trousers they were so well pressed the eye on them with a vintage paste weeks the Mayan like George Clement, so he ate grol for breakfast. When taking refuge in thickets of shrubbery, he passed the time by fomenting wild schemes in his brain. The skin on his ears had a pattern of verdigris as if it were copper or bronze. Likewise, the skin in the area of one of his collarbones imagine him at 90 in a dingey somewhere out on the cold and soaring sea alone without or compass or radio set, or his beloved sausages in camfil. His 10 flask of Courvoisier a, almost empty. Even here, long tailed vermin are scuttling through his mind, like the sewer It is his slobbering is unabated. Yet Two days later, he is to be found sprawled on a deck chair upon a golden beach is still glorious Buffon shiny with hair oil, the bolt in the back of his neck, freshly greased and dangling from the ring and the train of Panama hat, like the one favored by the actor Sydney Greenstreet. And imagine him now age just 10 at a crossroads in desolate terrain, a big black crow is perched on the signpost. With a shall he wander this puny child

beyond the pond and the puddles in that ramshackle owl enclosure and the ditches now count the ditches. You see there are 123 of them. Take this telescope. Can you see why beyond the third ditch across the flat mark, there is another ditch that is the last ditch that is way we are headed. Give me back the telescope and take my hand. I have a policy tanned on a withered arm and unsightly scars hidden under my cloak the results of a botched medical procedure. It was both invasive and pointless. I sent further withering of other limbs and appendages. Call it guesswork or hypochondria. I feel it in my water. That is why I'm so keen to get to the last ditch. It is where I will wallow pending the last trump you must help me across the pond and through the puzzles and past the owl enclosure and then over 123 ditches and then through the flat Mark until we get to the last ditch. After that it's up to you. You can come and wallow with me or turn around and make your way back. Either way, keep hold of your first aid kit. It's of no use to me. It's interesting that the carrion crows are hovering over the pond and the puddles rather than over the ditches. I suppose they have a completely different perspective up there be winged and raucous my wife became a crow the Whoo hoo hoody whoo woman cast a spell on her. And off she flew. I was standing by the pond in a puddle, watching my crow wife soar through the sky. I took out my telescope to follow her until she vanished in the blue. That's when I saw the last ditch for the first time. I thought it was just another Deck, the fourth one. After those three you can see from here, I suppose there were other decrees beyond it, a fifth and sixth and so on, as the flat Mark stretches to the horizon. But one day I put on my hiking boots and can carry the steak and strode out that way for miles. This was before the witterings Of course, before the medical procedure. I had vim, I walked all day and all night, and I got as far as the mountains. But I didn't come across any other ditches. That really is the last ditch. You remember his fan. I heard that he carried on past the last ditch all the way to the mountains as I did. But instead of turning back, he started climbing. Of course, he had grappling hooks and pythons and sturdy rope. So he was prepared. His vim made mine seem like latitude. I received one postcard from him. It was ice cold to the talk after that, nothing.

That's the end of this week's show. So able to get down from my standing phrase completely gone standing on my head standing on my head, I'll be able to get out of the standing on my head position and pull myself up. Right. But I hope you've enjoyed this week's show. Don't forget to visit the hooting out website at hooting yard.org where you can read thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of posts to juice over from over the last dozen years. Look at some pictures, buy some books, buy some paperbacks or buy the ebook by aerostat to hooting yard, a frank key reader which is the perfect introduction to my work incredibly cheap, I think it's four or five pounds an ebook and if it were published in book form, it probably be about five or 600 pages are all the stories on today's show a from that book. So I do recommend that you buy that. And with that, I'm going to take a deep breath and get out of my standing on my head position and go upright again. And I'll be back next week when I'll probably just sit down at the desk as I normally do. Bye bye.
