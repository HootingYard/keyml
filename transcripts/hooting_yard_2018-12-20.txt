Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Now the big news is, apart from the fact that this is the final show of 2018, as I'm sure you've worked out, but the big the big bad news is that the hooting od website which I know most of you spend, much of your time perusing is has been completely obliterated from the internet. It is not available whatsoever, and cannot be accessed by any computer in the world. But fear not risk is being seen too. And excitingly, there'll be a sort of relaunch of an all new singing and dancing, hooting yard website in the near future. But I don't know when. Because it's not my it's not my bag. Other people deal with this. But it does mean that the website is completely kaput, which means that because usually when I'm here, I read things by looking at the website and just picking from there. But this week, I'm unable to do that, as none of it is available. So I've had to have recourse to the old fashioned paper. And I was rummaging around looking for stuff to read. And I found some Phantom old printouts that I had made. And I thought so I thought I could read some of these to you today. And I thought I'd begin with a story called massacre of the innocence at Hoon, which is as far as I recall, about 30 years old it's a story from the previous century. And it was originally published in a in an out of print pamphlet called tales of Hoon, copies of which probably cost a fortune on eBay. Anyway, this is a dumb old old story written when I was young, and it's called massacre of the innocence at Hoon splattered with seagull droppings. The woman of twigs stood at the very edge of the cliff, her back to the sea. barefoot she rocked gently back and forth on her impromptu podium. The villages were gathered about her record and sniveling some carried pitchforks or dainty little tin boxes for a bit. They were all ears as they waited for the woman of twigs to speak. She had blindfolded herself with a threadbare bandage, bound her hair into tuft with flax and yarn and roots, and held in the hands and held in her hands, a ribbon of bloody silk precisely at the moment that the thousandth wave of the day crashed against the rocks below. The woman of twigs seest her rocking, cast the ribbon to the winds and shouting to make herself heard over the screeching goals began. You asked me to save the village from doom. I have communed with a variety of weird and tiresome shades to seek guidance. You are correct, your village is imperiled. There is only one way to rescue it from the coming agony. Three of your number must travel many miles distant to the town of Hoon, there, they must find a turn, possibly broken the turn of Hoon, which has had engraved upon it, or rather affecting the likeness of myself. Do not ask why. Having scoured Hoon for this turn and found in who knew this turn of Hoon, it must be brought back here with Drew haste and holed into the broiling sea from this very spot on the Cliff's edge. That task complete You're really drilled once again, no dilly, I have left unmentioned only one crucial point, the three who will venture to Hoon there to find and return the turn of Hoon must all be called Ned. That is all.

Work began at once on building the carrot. In the kitchens the villagers boiled up large iron pans full of mud and silt dredged from the riverbed. trees were felled in the spinny. The Smithy at his Advil, beat out a goodly supply of nails, spikes and very sharp hooks. Within a week, the foul smelling but indestructible vehicle was ready. Volunteers fanned out across the countryside to trap a suitable beast of burden. Horses, oxen, even a crippled reindeer of great elegance was sighted and stalked, but another week elapsed without success. Eventually, it was decided that the three Ned's would have to travel under their own steam pulling the carrot by themselves. Ned Ned and Ned agreed, drooling with excitement, in their eagerness to set out on so glorious and journey, one that would save the village and bring them renown left the village at a gallop in the middle of the night. Without maps they relied entirely on local law and superstition. from infancy eek Nate had been imbued with a long Catechism of souls and Proverbs. Now he had engraved upon his skull, a different calculate handed down through the generations. If you wish to go to Hoon, spit three times and follow the moon hoons beyond yawn crumpled head, hemmed around by gorse and saved when you see eight petals strewn your eight days and nights for a moon they traveled without pause to dragging the stinking carried, while we furred like bundled in it sleeping or feeding from polythene bags full of curdled slops. First, I followed the course of the great frightening river until suddenly it wormed its way underground. For 18 months, they traveled through a desolate landscape flat gray and enormous and curiously redolent of shard. But as I entered into hinterland, things changed, in rapid succession by passed on asbestos works a barrel of rainwater a custom post, damp Hector's elk encampments, fence posts, grotesque wooden carvings, horrifying shrubbery, improbable water tables, Jerry built hops, a kailyn quarry lumps of disgust, monstrous sorry monstrous gulches nebulous stretches of pointed brambly things, ornithologist hideaways, parakeet enclosures, quarentine shades, Rusk market, strange gobbets of sludge, a tremendous farmyard urn burials of vacuum wrestling pythons extravagant banks of yellow fog, yeast traffickers and zillah crushing factory, Ned said tonight and the Ned soon we shall be in Hoon, I can feel it in my water. He was not mistaken. The great South Gate of Hoon was over 1000 years old and completely overgrown by clumps of hideous fleshy foliage using poisonous SAP. All attempts to destroy this abominable vegetation had met with failure, and it had not been possible to open the gate for at least 200 years. Rather than blasting a hole in the town wall. A ramshackle lift contraption was knocked up close by two wooden platforms. One other side of the Great Wall were raised and lowered by an exciting system of

Frank Key  09:53
pistons pulleys, and winches operated by a team of gatekeepers where Bella constrictor masks, in return for their labors, they exacted a hefty price. Unfortunately, a hefty price Unfortunately, the three Ned's were utterly panelists, mastering among themselves, our heroic trio decided to profit gift in lieu of payment. Ned offered the gatekeepers his cap, which was made of rusted whisks. Ned presented them with a sick Toad he had been pampering for the past month, Ned gave them a handful of silt scraped from the underside of the chariot. well pleased with these gifts, the gatekeepers allowed the exhausted threesome to clamber onto the platform. Two days later, the three Ned's were lowered to the ground on the other side of the wall. Last February in Hoon, finding the possibly broken current of Hoon could only be a matter of time, they would be implacable by would be implacable fossicking into every corner of the ancient town. As soon as they disembark from the wooden platform, however, they were set upon by a whirling tangle of ruffians, who bashed them senseless stone with shirts off their backs. Empty their polythene bags of slops into the gutter, holy dismantled the chariot, had at them with ferocious scimitars and left them for dead. And indeed, Nate and Nate were dead. Ned was carted off by a passing stretcher patrol, but painted his last breath An hour later, by which time the ruffians have scampered away heading for the mountains. They stopped by the kale in Korea to eat their packed lunches. And then, as night came down, they strolled up the mountainside. These ravines their gazes fixed on the sky above, to look at the number of stars to view the boundless firmament.

I said I was young when I wrote that story and being young I was also pretentious. So I think it's probably worth telling you that I consciously based the final scene of Massacre of the Innocents at Hoon, on the third movement of Charles Ives is second string quartet. Anyway. Yes. Are we however, anyway, here's something else, which, again, predate the hooting yd website, and it's going to be read to us by pansy cradle June

1 and jetdirect support for that, known as puny verse and Jetix was a tiny taught, child of poor bandage wanders, who became world famous in 1932, when he single handedly averted a funicular railway disaster, in distance snowcapped mountains, saving the lives of thousands of people. His self sacrifice soon became legendary, and there were even moves to have him sanctified. The Pope was said to be in favor, but was outwitted by the cynical maneuvers of the local papal nuncio, who held a grudge against the boy's parents due to a bloody vendetta that lasted for several generations. Versus Gen X is brief life has been filmed many times. And there are very few male child actors who have not assayed the part. There is a no doubt apocryphal story that the grade child method Dr. Tad Wensleydale was willing to have his kidneys removed to add realism to his role in the magnetic boy, a 1962 version of the story.

Frank Key  14:49
So that piece was from the early very early years of this century. Massacre of the Innocents at Hoon, as I said, was from about 1988 30 years ago. This next piece is even older. As far as I recall, it was written in about 1983 or 1984. So I was even younger and even more pretentious. And this is called docking hack. hats are often docking caps are being docked. The Council's got a town plan, the master on a chart pips have been spat out and drudgery is by bide chocolate pudding seem to be in everybody's pantry. And here comes traitor bill. He caught a shark in waters. His Southwest has been askew since 1954 ish. Bubbles surged from froth the chemist shop is shot. There's pills and pills and pills that no docking man could swallow. Suffering aborted the counter in a caucus.

Plastic wrapped in plastic the docking coffers emptied in the broth saloon bar, a gorgeous snag to Babel. prepared to dance Puja, not a tear or boohoo thousands of museums stacked with golden maps, misshapen trunk road closures, big stone reconstructions dockings cottoned on to town about a tower. The frame is out of kilter, the coffins filling coffins. Oh, but I want to go back to that docking docking hack.

Frank Key  17:21
Just as I said that the previous story I read was influenced or at least at the end by Charles Ives, his second string quartet in a weird way, which I can't quite put my finger on. And yet I'm very well aware of docking hack, which I just read was heavily influenced by skank block belanja. The debut single by scritti politti before they went awful. I can't quite work out but there's something about it that I know when I wrote it. I was thinking of the lyrics of skank Bach belanja. You are your hardhat green Gartside and over to pansy cradle June.

Here's a little hidden. Here's a little poem. I walked along the filthy Street and knocked on the house. On the start again. I walked along the filthy Street and knocked at the house of sin. A Crone unlatched it spattered to me and said, You can't come in.
