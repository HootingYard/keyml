Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. The name of the show is hooting yard on the air written and presented by Frank key and sound engineered by Johnny seven. And this week I'd like to talk to you primarily about swans.

Frank Key  00:46
I was walking along the towpath of the old canal, when suddenly and out of nowhere. a madman Swan came flapping at me in stormy rage, and thumped me so hard with its wing, that it broke my arm. confound you, swan. I cried in my distress. But the swarm had already returned to the canal, gliding through the water, of vision of elegance. by one of those curious coincidences with which my life is stippled, the physician who tended to my fractured bone at the canal side clinic with called Dr. Swan fracture. I suppose you must have have to set quite a few bones broken by swans, I said, through the haze of anaesthetic with which I had been unnecessarily injected. Actually, you're the first such patient I have had to attend to in 20 years of practice at this clinic, said the doctor. For the swans on this canal are known for their placidity. There is perhaps something in the canal water. Later convalescing shattered on an Alpine balcony. I reflected on this. My reflections were unhappy ones. If Dr. Swan fracture was correct, and that canal swans were planted, then what had I done to provoke one of them to such uncharacteristic violent frenzy? Or was it not something I had done, but simply me my being my essential self? Was I without realizing it, a danger to swans. A man can come on down when faced with such an uncomfortable truth about himself. And I did indeed, come on dumb. I raved and splattered on rolled about. It never occurred to me that Dr. Swan fracture was talking through this hat. Many years past the majority of them spent trust and medicated and bewildered in a series of lunatic asylums. Before one day, I was visited by an ornithologist. This saintly chap was convinced that the mad and the lunatic and the bewildered, could be brought to their senses through a better appreciation of birds. He it was who enlightened me regarding the ineradicable savagery of swans. When I explained that there was something in the canal water that made placid the swans that greed there in he laughed like a drain. When eventually his gurgling ceased, he said he had never heard such poppycock in his life. There is no drug on Earth, he said, that could pacify a swan. Indeed, his own studies had shown that the only way to render a swan harmless was to ring its grateful neck. Dr. Swan fractures neck was anything but grateful. Rather, it was scrawny and bit pimple and wrinkled, as I learned when I clamped my dirt, my hairy hands around it and run it having striven into the canal side clinic and through his waiting room were sat several patients, nursing Swan broken arms.

This one isn't about swans. puny, neurasthenic cadet Vig, was on Sentry duty outside fought hoity for points when an angel of the Lord appeared unto him 12 point cadet vague trembled in terror. Two points. Excuse me. The angel of the Lord appeared to be perplexed. It opened its ring binder and looked carefully at the Wi Fi cadet, and then at its paperwork, and then at cadet Vig again, and then back to its paperwork, and it's brow furrowed. For the purposes of its earthly visitation. The angel had made use of a hole punch and inserted all his papers into the ring binder. Normally, when shimmering in its celestial holes, the angel had each individual sheet affixed to a wall with drawing pins. The mass of papers spread out for visual as is the practice with serial killers in television dramas. six points. You are puny neuro scenic and outside of forte said the angel. It says here you should be stately plump and inside a Martello tower. cadet Vig did not know what to say in response, so he married quaked two points. Well, never mind said the angels slamming shut to the ring binder. What 40s this? For Tweety, said cadet vague truthfully. The angel returned to its ring binder. One point rummaged through the papers found the entry forget vague and said. According to my records, you are meant on this day at this hour to be on sensory duty at 4288 point. cadet Vig was on the point of swooning, his legs turned to jelly as he realized that yet again. He had misread the duty roster. Captain nitti would be furious 10 points. The milk SOP cadet had an awful vision of months stretching ahead during potato peeling punishment. How long he wondered? Would it take him to cross the Erie marshes to Fort toity. Could he get there before Captain Mitty discovered his mistake? He had a sudden bright idea. Is it in your power? He asked the angel of the Lord to transport me instantaneously to the sentry post outside fort toity far away across the Erie marshes. So I will not get into one of my pickles with Captain Mitty. The angel once again considered the content of its ring binder six point yes it said eventually that is well within my power. But I am minded instead on this starry starry night to shower you cadet vague, with teeming thousands name millions of points more points than any cadet under Captain at each command has ever been awarded. Now cadet Vig did swoon he crumpled to the ground next to the century box outside fort whitey. As he lay there, robbed of consciousness, innumerable golden shining points rained down upon him. And when he woke, the angel of the Lord had vanished, and stars drifted across the boundless firmament, and here clanking towards him in full armor, Captain nitti his face purple with rage, his eyes like burning coals, two points, and cadet Vig for the first time in his puny life was not afraid. He cocked his blunderbuss and took aim at Captain nitti he had millions of points. This story has accumulated a total of 53 points, if I have tallied them correctly.

plops onto the map from Tim third. Boy, Mr. Key you seem to know an immense amount about birds, yet virtually nothing about fish. Is there any reason for this disparity? If so, I'm agog to know a god I tell you passionately yours, Tim Fern. Often with Tim's letters, I find the best thing to do is to ball them up in my fist. scrunch them a few times. Then deposit them in the wastepaper basket. Occasionally after the scrunching I drop them directly down a waste chute. If, for example, the wastepaper basket is overflowing, as it sometimes is, or even if space remains in the wastepaper basket, I feel impelled to cast the letter as far from me as possible to obliterate it from my sight. There is always the possibility you say that if I put the scrunched rhetor into the wastepaper basket, I might wipe it languishes there, hike it out and unstructured and unball it up, if that's a phrase and reread it. Once it's plunged down a waste chute. It's gone forever, of course, or at least it's retrieval is made a matter of great complexity, necessitating the involvement of various municipal waste management personnel who may or may not demand bribes or other favors in order to send one of their number or some kind of scuffling robot down into the middle to run rummage for tins, scrunched letter. Usually when I discarded him with letters so promptly, it's because they're annoying. He can be a very exasperating correspondent. And I think he takes a curious pride in being so I may be wrong on that point, but I don't think I am. Some people gain a great deal of pleasure from being annoying. And Tim is one of them. I believe he sits there, wherever it is he live, picturing in his mind's eye and me, huffing and puffing, balling up and then scrunching his latest letter, tossing it into a wastepaper basket or down or waist chute, and then going to have a lie down in a darkened room to recover from the mental disturbances caused me I in my turn, live there in the dark, picturing in my mind's eye Tim thurn, chuckling or chortling, or even guffawing fatuously as he imagines my irritation. I impute vacuity tears laughter because this makes it more vivid and hateful. Having no idea what Tim looks like, I have to rely on my imagination. Sometimes he is a sin as a rake, angular and CD with unseemly stains on his clothing. And other times he is a Tubby kind of fellow smug and Goofy and seedy with unseemly stains on his clothing. Once I was so damn livid after reading one of his letters, that I decided to consult the graphologist who could from Tim's handwriting, fashion a convincing portrayed often the possession of which could help me visualize is despicable. chuckling chortling guffawing, vacuity all the more vividly. Unfortunately, Tim confounded me by typing his letters, which rather paid to my plan. It would be wrong, however, to think that all of Tim's missives are equally annoying, some of them are not not annoying at all. Those ones I do not boil up and scrunch and dispose of, but instead my out flat upon the bluffing pad upon my desk, and I reread them carefully while composing in my head a reply. Such was the case with the one cited above regarding birds and fish. It was an unexceptionable vaguely polite query, and I thought it deserving of a civil response. Of course, I didn't want to give anything away. I do not want Tim thurn or anyone else for that matter, peering into the innards of my head to see what lurks within whether or not I know the first thing about birds or fish is my business and nobody else's.

Frank Key  13:55
So go get called for a polite response. I could not answer Tim's question directly. I would have had to craft my reply as carefully as I read and re read the letter that is very carefully indeed. Eventually fueled by a slurp of Dr. Baxter's invigorating Brighton syrup, I worked out precisely what to write. First, though, I called on my priest to ascertain how many years I would have to languish in purgatory, where I'd be less than truthful, or to put it bluntly, to tell a bare faced lie. apprised of this information, which seemed not too onerous, I wrote. Dear Mr. thurn, thank you for your delightful and not at all annoying letter. I'm afraid that somewhere on its journey between your postbox and my doormat. It was Norwood and nibbled by squirrels or some such small skittering mammals, and much of the content destroyed or rendered a lead illegible. The only surviving text is an email Somehow two birds, and I am agog to know, might I suggest that grammatically it would be better to place those phrases in reverse order. That being so I would happily bombard you with whatever it is you wish to learn about, for example, Swift's and swallows and geese, and starlings and linnets and partridges and quail and woodpeckers and teal, and pressing coals and thrashes, and warblers and orcs and guillemots and share waters and spoon bells and skewers and albatrosses and swans and pigeons and owls, and penguins, and rooks, and crows and Deluxe, and our Beano Deluxe, and pipits and ostriches and cassowaries and grebes and divers and cranes and egrets and sandpipers and cookers and parrots and waders and goals, and night jars and cockatoos and budgerigars and petrels and for miles and mittens and herons and more hens and pelicans and kestrels and cormorants. Especially cormorants, and hobbies and kites and rails and eagles and busta rods and corncrakes and P hens and clovers and lapwings and wryneck and curlews and turns and doves and grouse and razorbills and parakeet and hummingbirds and Rennes and magpies and drac doors and add a push chickens by me now in a bit more detail which birds are of particular interest to you. Yours carefully. Mr. Key

in a medieval painting Captain nitti boring attribute. St. Clement, for example is usually shown with an anchor, St. JOHN chrysostom. With B's st Dunstan with a hammer and tongs and st vest with a wolf carrying a goose in its mouth. Captain ality was often to be seen with a handful of breadcrumbs. There are several photographs of Captain nitti taken by the pointy town High Street snap by Fx duggleby. And all but one of which is attribute or emblem is present and correct. Captain nitti holdout he's open and palm piled with breadcrumbs as if proffering them to the viewer. The exception is the picture of Captain nitti. Pretending to fly. He is wearing a pair of wings made out of corrugated cardboard, satin and Tat, and gazing into the middle distance with a look of startling stupidity. The trains with which he is attached to the ceiling of duggleby Studio are clearly visible despite the photographer's effort to bleach them out with bleach. reading this, I'm suddenly reminded I think I read this only a couple of weeks ago, but I'm going to carry on in any case. There are two different stories given as to the origin of Captain if he's traditional association with a handful of breadcrumbs. The first is that our hero was regularly sent on maneuvers to a municipal Park, where insurgents bent on toppling the regime were sent to use the flower beds with their dazzling splurges of lupins and hollyhocks as places of concealment, and then to the flower beds with a pond in which to mergansers pin tails on swans were rife. softhearted, and by some accounts, soft brain, Captain nitti like to feed the ducks and swans by scattering breadcrumbs upon the surface of the waters. After the regime was toppled, he took much of the blame distracted by ducks in the words of the official chargesheet. Unlike a saint in a medieval painting, Captain that he was not martyred unless one considers a sentence of several months potato peeling, duty, and martyrdom. The other story is vastly more complicated, and impossible the summarize, readers would do better to study the seven volume level sequence game of breadcrumbs, making notes all the while in the margins. Those of you without the patience or ability to read can instead watch the television adaptation, which is one of the mantel pieces worth rewards, including the silver bobble for best swarm and the FX duggleby Memorial pot for most innovative use of bleach. And I did read that only a couple of weeks ago, certainly within the last month, for which I apologize. But you know, sometimes I have to repeat myself, because I will Anyway, it was read a bit differently. And you'll, you've enjoyed it anyway, I hope.

Frank Key  20:32
Yeah, as john pointed out, it was a remix or a cover version. Can the original artists do the cover version of their own work? An alternate version. That's what that just was. It was an alternate version of something I did recently. Anyway. Speaking of Captain nitti, one bright grim morning, Captain nifi, was walking along and imposing an expansive Boulevard, when one of his lungs collapsed. he gasped before crumpling in an untidy Angular heap upon the paving slabs. As he fell, his capitani cap fell off his head, and landing on its brim roll into the gutter, where it was worried by a stray dog. The dog had strayed from its owner, who was known to Captain nitti. Though the dog was not captain, he had what is known as dog blindness, in that he could never perceive any dog with any of his five senses. So even had he had his wits about him. Rather than being sprawled gasping on the pavement, he would not have been aware of the dog gnawing and pulling his cap. Lighter, in a bed on a ward in the clinic to where he had been ferry by a rickety and inefficient ambulance, Captain that he asked the clinic chaplain, who was sitting at his bedside, telling the seven last words from the cross on his rosary beads, where his cap was, the Chaplin replied in Latin, a language with which Captain nitti was unfamiliar. What he said was, Do not interrupt me with questions about your cap, when I'm praying for the salvation of your immortal soul, through the words of Christ in His last extremity. But in Latin, meanwhile, the dog had carried the cap in its mouth, away from the boulevard to a patch of gauze and scrub over by the viaduct. Here it lost interest in the cap and deposited it in a puzzle. Then it scampered off to frighten some tiny tots gathered around the spooky fathomless inky black pond. Captain nitti made a miraculous recovery and that very same day at around tea time was back on his feet. He discharged himself from the clinic and went in search of his cap. does it bring tears to your eyes? The thought of him bareheaded and desperate, looking in all the wrong places plagued by invisible dogs day after grim bright day. fruitlessly, fruitlessly, fruitlessly, it should.

Finally this week, or at least I think, finally, here's an extract from Captain knitties diary from 1954. Last night, it was my turn on duty for the nocturnal pig watch. brandishing my out punch doc. I set out across the top pooter as night came crashing down. Some say it is an affectation of mine to use a Swiss stick designed for mountainous terrain when crossing the flat, wild, bleak, desolate, windswept top hooter. Perhaps it is, but I never leave home without my open stock these days. Some say also, Why are there no Twilight's anymore? No dusks. And it is true that nowadays, day turns to night in a seeming instant. I cannot account for this. So I do not try to conjecture would prove fruitless I fear and would make no difference. The fact is, as I grasped told of my owl punch, doc and open the door There was daylight and when I stepped out, and as I pulled the door shut behind me, so it was night. Night, the time when we were night, the time when we must keep watch for pigs. It has not always been so years ago if you can believe it, there was not even a nocturnal pig observatory on the top puja. Apparently people used to just turn down the lights in their huts and chalets and lie down in their beds and sleep untroubled sleep. It is hard to credit is it not? Yet it was so. Wherever nocturnal pig observatory now stands, a triumph of filigree in cement, as it has been described, was nothing more than a stretch of flat wild, bleak, desolate, windswept tar puja identical to the flat, wild, bleak, desolate, windswept tabuteau, surrounding it on all sides, as far as the eye can bear to see. hammering on the door with my open stock. I summon the duty pig observer whose shift was at an end. He handed me the cap and the dockets and flips and flaps and repeats, unfold his umbrella and headed out across the night blacktop pooter I see I settled myself at the console and adjusted the pig scanner. There was a poem from the oil heater, but at least I was warm. Outside the wind was howling, and the stars were quivering in the heavens. I thought a beer pints poem, wobbly stars. And so I gazed, I gazed now at the monitor monitors. Now out through the reinforced plexiglass pig proof window. I saw no pigs. It was a small mercy. But we must snapshot small mercies and cover one close and cherish them for not all nights of piglets on the flat, wild, bleak, desolate, windswept takuto.

Frank Key  27:31
That's all we have time for this week. There will probably be more about swans and even more about Captain nifi next week. Those of you who've been a coupon an eye on the hooting yard web website will have noticed that it hasn't been updated for about two months. I'm not sure entirely why this is possibly share indolence, possibly a vacancy between my ears. But I'm hoping to get it cracking again very shortly. So do keep an eye on it. And you can always visit and read years and years worth of archives in any case, and yeah, that's it for this week. I'll be I'll be here again next week. Bye bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:22
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans of the Nerds who wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
