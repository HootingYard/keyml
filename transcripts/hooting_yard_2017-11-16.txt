Hello, my name is Frank key Oh, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com if you're listening on a computer, and this is hooting out on the air, and then as we know, there came a time when tahltan the amateurs amateur came a Cropper, he was in pursuit of a shifty pastry Hawker. A man with a barrel known to galumphing long illite lanes. tarlton carried a torch sweeping it's bright beam ahead of him, both through avoid pits and puzzles, and in hopes that he might catch a glimpse of his quarry. But as the old saying has it, a torch in the hands of a nincompoop sheds no light. Incidentally, it's well worth your while to jot down old sayings and a notepad when you hear them. They can be invaluable in establishing rapport with countryside peasants. If you fall into conversation with such a person, you will discover that their utterances often consist of little else, but old sayings strung together. By dropping in your own crumbs of rustic wisdom from time to time, you will be able to maintain conversational sparkle, in other words, in otherwise trying circumstances. The beauty of it is you do not need to grasp the actual meaning of the old sayings you deploy. Consider, for example, the one we've just encountered. A talk in the hands of a nincompoop sheds no light. On the face of it. This would seem to make little or no sense. Unless we presume the nincompoop has neglected to press the knob that lights the bulb of the torches carrying But one must always avoid presumption as we learned from botsman third notebook lavinda series, say that saying to say a sophisticated urban person at a Swiss cocktail party, and you face a series of brewski questions, demanding that you clarify what you're saying. Say the same words to a peasant in the countryside. And as likely as not he will suck thoughtfully on his piece of straw, a nod before parrying with a saying of his own such as you can't milk a goat with a hammer. But white white white things are the words erupting inside your head dear listener, you say I know you only too well. Grateful as I am to be given tips on talking to peasants. You say? tips I will no doubt my use of where next I go trudging through an area of rustic squalor. I cannot let past the clear implication in your opening that Tarleton was a nincompoop. How can such things be? Talton? The amateurs aerator and nincompoop? Surely, Sir, you are in jest. Batman's answer that it's true enough that few persons have ever tried this earth whose brains were as acute as dolphins indeed hold his brain in the palm of your hand, and you would be astonished at its heft. It is worth noting in this context, that you could if you wish to so hold Tarzan's brain. It is kept preserved in jelly in a jar in a display case in the lobby of his alma mater, Miss blossom partridges Institute for the education of frighteningly adept tinies make an appointment with the bursa, Don a pair of gloves, and an attendant will open the display case and unscrew the lid from the jar. And with special tweezers, lift the brain from its protective jelly and allow you to hold it, registering it tefft for up to 60 seconds. The jar is clearly labeled with tulsans name so you will not miss daycare for the brains of other alumni in other jellies in other jars in other display cases in the same lobby. Now, as true as it is that Tarleton was no dimwit, it is equally true that nincompoop burry is to be found in the most unexpected places. Here we might recall another pursuit of blockman from the fifth notebook, lilac series. No man is all nincompoop he observed, but all men have an inner nincompoop ever ready to emerge and flourish.

Frank Key  05:18
botsman compares this inner nincompoop to a mayfly in a passage I recommend your attention. His point is that even the most dazzlingly, sensible and spectacular minds may from time to time, and ephemerally exhibit the shore signs of nincompoop Murray. This is what I argue happened with Tarleton as he stumbled down an elite lane in pursuit of the shifty pastry Hawker. It was night a black night moonless and starless on account of a great shroud of cloud. The first incipient sign of telephones, in a nincompoop was that he did not wait until sunrise to go prowling after his quarry. Even the swiftest of shifty pastry hawkers cannot cover too much ground trundling a Barrow in the hours between dusk and dawn, and overmind would still be ill lit in the daylight, shaded as it was on either side by towering pines and Titanic cedars, yet there would be light enough for a man of tarlton piercing vision. Not so on this night. This black on Holy Night. On holy I say because it was the one night in the camera in the year when intps and goblins are let loose from their fetters, and are free to dash about all mystery fun havoc and mayhem. On this night, turns are upended, Wells poisoned cows turned inside out. That at least is what the peasants believe. It's what they will tell you in the form of old sayings if you're willing to listen. The wise man stays a bed on since spiv x night they will say or when Slovaks night comes around again, burner Dolly and slaughter a hen for all the startling heft of his brain touton the amateurs amateur did not need to heed such warnings. In fact, he dismissed the peasants old sayings as nonsensical babble. This was his undoing. This was his nincompoop re. And so he went a stumbling along and Ill lit lane in the night, sweeping the beam of his torch ahead of him. What was he to do when all of a sudden, a goblin came swooping down and gobbled up the light and swallowed it, and then belt it out in the form of thick black poisoned fumes. Poor Tarleton was terrified, and in his terror, he turned on his heel and ran from the Goblin. But he made only a half turn. So no sooner did he begin to flee. Then he crashed into a towering pine or a titanic cedar, and came a Cropper and the back given to his head, dislodged his brain, within his cranium, and he fell to the ground and knew no more. He might have been dead. The peasant who found him at daybreak, thought him so and being a grave digging peasant. He hoisted his spade from over a shoulder and began to dig a pit in which to chuck the body. he whistled that he dug an ancient rustic cocoon, and it was the sounds of his whistling and of his digging, that woke Tarleton from his stupor. He robbed his bonds but remembered nothing of what had happened during the black on holy night. He did not even remember that he had been pursuing a shifty pastry Hawker. Where am I? He asked in an uncharacteristically weedy and quavering voice. What place is this? What day is it? Why are you digging a pit?

Frank Key  09:17
The peasant did not reply. He was an obtuse peasant, and a peasant with a stubborn sense of purpose. Having began to dig a grave by the side of the lane in the shade of towering pines and Titanic cedars, nothing would stop him until he had shoved the whole body Six Feet Under and covered it over with earth. And here was a second instance of tulsans nincompoop, very close observation of the peasants countenance of the grim determination of his digging, might have persuaded Tarleton to get to his feet and Run, run away as fast as he could. But he sat up and let his public And listen to birdsong and he was still sitting and smoking and listening. When the peasant is digging done, threw down his spade and turned and picked up Tarleton in one huge hairy hand by the scruff of his neck and chucked him into the pit and retrieved his babe and began to shove spiteful after spiteful of soil and muck rich with worms over the amateurs amateur sprawled in the pit, and soon enough, buried, never to be found. The peasant stamped his great boots on the grave to smooth the ground and remove all traces of his digging, and then whistling he went on his way. Just one thing you interrupt. If Tarleton was buried alive in an unmarked grave and an L rip lane in an area of rustic squalor, how is it that his brain was retrieved and stored in jelly you know jar in a display case? in the lobby is Miss blossom Partridge Institute for the education of frighteningly adept tinies Ah, I could tell you a thing or two about Miss blossom Partridge, and certain members of staff at her institute that would curb all the blood in your veins. Things innocent is should never here remember the old peasant saying? ignorance is better by far when you see a brain in jelly in a jar.

This is a story called The blind goose killer of IRQ. Last night, I dreamt I went to IRQ again, have you ever been to wide awake or in your dreams? You would surely remember if you had IRQ is a unique place. A tiny Belgian and clay exclave sorry, is a unique place a tiny Belgian exclave oh so high in the Alps. More precisely, it is an exclave of the province of Flanders. Valid tiny population include a tiny proportion of war loons. archives are known to state with pride that nothing ever happens in work. That is largely true. It is so tiny and so high above sea level, in contrast to the rest of Flanders, that very little of note has ever occurred that its official history available from the kiosk in the street, both singular runs to a four page pamphlet printed in very big type one and a half pages of which consists of advertisement, and the pages themselves are tiny, just as the kiosk is tiny, and the street is short, never signed up to the European Union's Schengen treaty. So visitors if there are any still need to show their passport, the frontier. This is a chalet at the foot of the funicular railway which climbs up up up dizzying steepness to the village where the air is thin and the police officer is idle. As one of the lights from the railway one is thrust almost immediately into the heart of irk. This is the village square. It is a pack of well tended lawn with a flower bed rife with tulips and in and a tiny concrete statue of Tip Top Belgian cyclist Eddie Merckx, it is here you will find also slumped on a bench at all hours of day and night, the blind goose killer of irk. When the exclave was founded by a smattering of Belgian tuberculosis patients over 100 years ago, it was decreed that only one person in earth was permitted to kill a goose and that this person must be blind. All the other laws governing the territory were imported wholesale from Flanders. The origins of the goose killing edict are obscure and may have resulted from a misunderstanding. Whatever the country There has always and forever been a designated blind goose killer in Urk. It is a lifetime position, one of great honor but paltry reward. What happens is this, let us say you are in Urk and you wish to make a goose die, you must go to the bench in the square and rouse the blind goose killer, who is probably dozing, you introduce yourself presenting your identity papers if you are an archive, or your passport, if you are a visitor. The blind goose killer cannot Of course, see these documents, but well act what is known as the sniffing and the rustling of the pages. You must then state in Flemish that you wish a goose to be killed and ask the blind goose killer to kill the goose for you. almost invariably, and while still half asleep, the blind goose killer will accede to your request, although once in a blue moon, or if in an ill temper, or if bilious, he or she will refuse. Assuming the answer is positive, you must then go and fetch the goose you want killed. You hand the goose to the blind goose killer. Apart from blindness Another characteristic shared by all who have held the position is the possession of a pair of hands with eerie, vaguely inhuman musculature. Once in the grip of these hands, the goose cannot escape its fate. You could say it's goose is cooked, though that introduces a second putative abstract goose, which is one goose to many and may serve to befuddled, the blind goose killer, so is best left unsaid. As soon as it has been strangled, you take the dead goose from the blind goose killer and offer your thanks.

Although they are in receipt of an annual stipend from the burgers of IRQ you should give them some loose change as a tip. As I said last night, I dreamt I went to work again. It was a disturbing dream more of a nightmare. The entire tiny exclave was overrun with living honking dazzlingly white geese, and there on the bench in the Square was slumped the blind goose killer, torn and bloody and lifeless. He had been pecked to death.

grasp of the baffled eel is a brand new children's book about an eel named Jasper, who is baffled what baffles in Oh, just about everything that happens in his life as an eel. I don't need to go into the details. I'm sure you can imagine yourself as an eel and tally up in your head, all the things that would baffle you. I say it's a children's book. And that's indeed how it's been marketed by the soulless twerps in the marketing department of the publishing house. But I suspect the book may appeal more to older readers, very old readers, those in or approaching their dotage. It may even proved popular among those who have passed beyond dosage into death. at rest and and coffin What better token of life to take with them clutched in their cold, stiff hands than this baffling eally book. There are no illustrations. Most of the words as simple ones have one or two syllables, with only a few instances of longer or less common words, among which I noted flap doodle japonaise array and hemoglobin jaspar. The email is baffled by these words, but you will not be not even if you're dead, because nothing baffles the dead. They say walls have ears but birds and eels do not. They also say that Jesus wants me for a sunbeam. But try telling that to an eel. You will only baffle the eel as Jasper is baffled in a bravura display of realism. It might even be Hyper Realism. There were certainly points in the book where I felt vividly that I'd been plunged into the wide Sargasso Sea. I was sopping wet and festooned with seaweed, though it's fair to say that I'm usually sopping and festooned when reading books, it is and always has been my way. Oh Jasper Jasper, pour baffles he will no longer a glossy ello an elver with its life stretching before it full of promise, but a full grown adult eel lost in the immensity of the world, oceans and seas and rivers and lakes and other watery parts. watery parts of the cover seven tenths of the globe, with its magnetic bits and its vegetation and its eels. For Jasper is not alone. But he is alone in this book, population of eels and its pages one, one al but Oh, how he fills those pages, turning up once, twice, even three times before it's time for you to turn the leaf. And that's not surprising, because this is his story. No other eel gets a look in a nauders any other living creature other than occasional mentions of a rabbit and a plover and a brass neck goose. But these are incidental beings. They will one day have their own books in which Jasper eel may make a fleeting appearance. I would have been interested to learn more in this book about eels and gap on a zuri. But then, most people who know me will attest that I constantly carp on about eels and Japanese to the exclusion of other perhaps more pressing matters. I make no apology. Though I may never be transfigured into a sunbeam for Jesus. I have buttered my parsnips and I will take them with me to the grave. Instead of my copy of Jasper The baffled eel, which I will donate to an orphanage library for the future edification of generation after generation of orphans tinies as baffled as Jasper, by the complexities of this complex and baffling universe. Now, let us all sing saga niveau de bloomin Xin

there's gonna be a slight pause while I wait to line up for the next thing I'm going to read to you. So just hold your horse, horses hold your Hold your horses. What does that phrase, john, where does that phrase come from? Our Deborah Vaughn. Who? I have no idea someone who had too many horses. Yeah. And there's a lot of them. I'm sure. A lot of people who have too many horses, and Okay, I'm ready to go. One morning. Recently, I walked out of my house and along the path to my front gate and they're standing on the other side of it was a barbarian. Sensing he was about to smash my gate down with mighty blows from the heavy wooden club he was brandishing. I moved to distract his attention by pointing up at the sky and saying, Oh, look at p wit. According to Pepin, stows bumper book of barbarians. barbarians are particularly partial to P words and will usually become much less barbaric in their presence. But of course, I had invented the P word. I have pointed at nothing. I was merely playing for time. Soon enough, the Barbarian at my gate would realize that there was not a nearby p word. And he would set about smashing down my gate and laying waste to anything and everything in his path, including me. As he turned his head to look up, therefore, I dug into my pocket for a glob of plasticine. And I swiftly fashioned it Excuse me.

Frank Key  25:08
Okay, as he turned his head to look up, therefore, I dug into my pocket for a glob of plasticine and swiftly fashioned it into a toy or model peewit it was a pretty cack handed effort resembling a punch drunks darling, or even starlin rather than a p word. I hope Nevertheless, it would serve to fool the Barbarian and placate him for a minute or two. This would give me time to make a call to the defensive civilization foot patrol, who would come screeching up in their squad cars, and taser The Barbarian. You might wonder why a foot patrol goes about in cars. But these are strange times. Strange Times indeed. Before I had time to call them however, the Barbarian at my gate had ascertained that the sky was empty of pee wit turned his head back to glare at me, spotted the plasticine sort of P which in my outstretched hand, made a series of mawkish, icky cooing noises. Grab the P word in his huge hairy paw, and began to dribble. Not for the first time I gave thanks to Patton stone. But in the bumper book of barbarians, Pepin stone advises strongly against the tasering of placated barbarians. Apparently, this only redoubles their barbarity when the effects of the taser were off. Thus, I was in something of a quandary. The Barbarian too stupid to realize that the plasticine p word was not a real p word. remained as if transfixed at my gate, thus blocking my exit, and I had an urgent appointment at the village wrestling ring. Also, it occurred to me that the manner in which the Barbarian was mauling the P word. In the mistaken belief that he was coddling it meant that it would soon lose its purity shape, and be once again a plasticine glob. As soon as the Barbarian noticed this, he would cease the cooing and the dribbling and be once again barbaric. What was it Pepin stone had written to the Barbarian mauling his coddling or words to that effect. I realized I needed a real peewit one that could fly and thus coax the Barbarian to follow it away from my gate. But where can I obtain a p with a short notice? I rushed back indoors and logged into the EP wit website on my computer. I noted that there were a couple of fairly local peewit vendors, one of whom offered express delivery by drone. I tried to place an order but as usual we EP with site was agonizingly slow, and repeatedly asked me for my password and the name of my childhood pet puppy. I could not remember my password, and I never had a puppy. In desperation, I wondered if I could make my own flying p word out of plasticine by attaching to it a propeller. I had a stash of plasticine. But where could I obtain a propeller? Could I make one using a couple of drinking straws? Damn Pepin stone for not addressing this eventuality. Then I heard the first crunch of my gate being smashed by the barbarians club. Clearly the plasticine peewit had lost its shape and he was no longer placated. I cowered in a corner, listening to the awful sounds of the Barbarian, destroying my gate and my garden path and my front door and anything else in his way as he came lumbering barbarically into the room. I was about to cry out for mercy using the wording recommended by Pepin stone when the Barbarian laid down his club, mopped his brow with a filthy rag and said, Good morning to you, sir. I am detective Captain unstrapped nada Taub. I come from a far country and my brain is hot.
