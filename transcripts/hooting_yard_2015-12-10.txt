Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And I'd like to begin with a variation on a theme by protocol harm. Conquistador your stallion stands in need of company for an adventurer and conqueror, especially one who led the Spanish conquest with Mexico and Peru in the 16th century. This is a lapse on your part. You should never leave your horse alone and abandoned, for it is likely to become fractious. And the last thing you want to have to deal with, either in the jungles or the mountains, is a fractious horse. You might argue that a native Peruvian firing poisonous darts at you through a blowpipe would cause the more concern than a horse in a bad mood. But there you would be wrong. Let's say that the native Peruvians aim is impeccable and his poisoned Dart plunges into your neck. It is true that you would be surprised and have only minutes to live as the toxins Ravage your innards, but it's a simple enough matter to pluck the Dart out of your flesh and have one of your fellow Conquistadores immediately suck on the puncture, drawing every last drop of poison into his mouth before spitting it out. Apply a medicinal poultice to the tiny hole in your neck and job done. You will be right as rain and ready to carry on adventuring and conquering. By contrast, if after abandoning your stallion while you clanked off on foot on an errand of death, you return to it to find it lonely, fractious, and temperamental. You may have some difficulty getting back into your saddle, your horse may re up on its hind legs, and make terrifying bellowing noises. If you're not careful, you could end up being cracked under its mighty hooves. A fleck of horse spittle might land in your eye, blurring your vision. The rest of your Conquistador troupe may have written on a head, leaving you behind without food or water or a compass. You will know from your training back into lado that it can take hours to become a fractious horse, by which time your chances of catching up with your fellow adventuring conquerors before nightfall are remote. Unless the Conquistador who suck the poison out of your neck has stayed with you. You will now be all alone in a strange, exotic landscape. famished you do not know which fruits and berries are safe to eat. And in any case, there will only be fruits and berries available to you. If you're in the jungle. As I pointed out earlier, you might be up in the mountains and there will be little to eat but impacted snow, which you will have to melt and soften before trying to shovel it down your throat. Bear in mind that the air is very thin up in the higher reaches of the Andes and you will become exhausted quite rapidly, especially if you're expending energy hacking at a patch of snow to make it more easily meltable. Added to these impairments your horse will be hungry too. And it's fractiousness may return with a vengeance. You will have to find a way to duplicate it a second time. And by now it will be wise fewer clicks. If it is a clever horse, which it probably is having been chosen out of so many other horses to go on a conquista dorial campaign. It is also much more difficult to become a frightened horse in the dark. And the Peruvian night is far more eerie than the night in teredo with which both you and your stallion are familiar Further problem will present itself. If a nocturnal Peruvian native fires a second poisonous Dart into your neck through a blowpipe. Yes, it's simple enough for you to remove the Dart. But without a fellow Conquistador. to suck out the venom, you will have to instruct your horse to do the deed.

Not many horses are skilled in such an art. Apart from anything else, their mouths are much bigger than the average Conquistadores mouth, and their teeth are huge, so it's exceedingly difficult for them to get sufficient purchase on your neck to suck with any conviction. Of course, if you have a vampire hoard, it will suck away quite happily. But after draining the poison, it will continue to suck your blood until the top over, topple over, pale and dead. All things considered Conquistador, you're advised never to leave your stallion in need of company. No horse is an island entire of itself. Further tips on looking after your horse when adventuring and conquering in Mexico and Peru. Available in the are available in the government pamphlet. 50 tips for Conquistadores on looking after your horse when adventuring and conquering in Mexico and Peru.

I've never been a fan of comic books, nor have I developed a taste for graphic novels. I can admire the scale and inventiveness but somehow I can't drum up genuine enthusiasm. Of course as a child, I had my weekly diet of comics, including Pepsi popsy, factory met addicted addictive memorabilia, and the dinky. But when I discovered proper books, I was smitten by pros. And there was no turning back. Until last week, that is when I discovered a fantastic comic featuring the cartoon superhero laundry bag boy, I have to admit it's been a revelation. And I'm smitten all over again, this time by crude and cat candy drawings and by storylines which have surely been devised by a dribbling toddler. Yeah, there's a majestic cleanness about laundry bag boy, his adventures. This scrapes his pratfalls, his laundry bag that I find irresistible. The comic got picked up absent mindedly from where it had been discarded on a bench under a sycamore by a path in a park was fat and dog eared and threatened by rainfall.

I thought no more than to carry it to the nearest municipal waste bin and consign it to oblivion. But the waste bins had been commandeered by an avant garde arts project organized by a man called Simon whose name was Peter, just like one of the apostles of Christ. But whereas the apostles were, as Charles bradlaugh 1833 to 1891, observed illiterate half starved visionaries in some dark corner of a Greco Syrian slum. The artists Simon and his pals were goatee bearded trendies from shortage destined to rot in hell. Before they rotted, they'd filled over municipal waste pins in the park with some kind of compacted orange substance hardest concrete, rendering the bins unusable. According to leaflets available from the temporary kiosk, this art intervention was a courageous statement about Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib and the war on terror marches. I would have liked to wander through the park from Ben to been contemplating this thought provoking work. I found that my thoughts were paralyzed rather than provoked. So instead, I took shelter from the downpour. Under a derelict bandstand, and began to live through the comic, I'm so glad I did. Issue 10 volume 34 of laundry bag boy contained a couple of short strips about Douglas the pig, who was I learned laundry bag boys Peppa Pig, and a few pages of adverts and promotions for other publications. The bulk of the comic, however, was a single full length comic strip adventure called laundry bag Boy, that shark attack years now, just as in my adulthood, I've never been a comic buff. Nor have I ever cared much or at all for shark attack, the British jazz funk band who had hits in the 1980s with night birds and down on the street, among others. Frankly, their smooth path left me cold when first I heard it, and still does two decades on. readers who lit or listeners who disagree with me and wish to champion the music of Shaq attack and show me the error of my ways are invited to argue their case. But I will only pay attention to contributions which shake me to the core and forced me to reassess my entire vote time travel. Those are the stakes. Be very careful before you tap that keyboard and hit send. The plot of the story such as it is, posits that for a period of seven years precisely wiki is our maddeningly unspecified laundry bag boy acts as a kind of familiar to the dollars dishwater jazz funk stirs by remain unaware of his presence, but he's always there haunting them, watching over them in a patch of shadow on stage or perched up in the rafters of the recording studio, breathing softly clutching his laundry bag, which is sometimes empty, but more often, about two thirds full of filthy unmentionables long overdue for the washing machine. With his yellow hair and blazing eyes, we the readers can always spot the superhero, but to the shark attack personnel, including roadies sound engineers and hang persons on he might as well be invisible. You may wonder why none of them smell the pond emanating from his laundry bag at times when it is about two thirds full. This is because one of laundry bag boys superpowers is an ability to pluck from the empty air a canister of air freshener and spray the contents of his noise some bags until it smells of roses and honey and lavender and poppy coral, and citrus mango and pumpkin and nutria doll and peach and apple and, and one other fragrance, the name of which I cannot be bothered to look up right at this minute. More than one critic reviewing a shark attack concert is claimed to have dubbed them the sweetest smelling band in the world. Although whether this really happened outside the pages of the comic book is not something I'm competent to assert or deny. For I don't care one way or the other.

I'm less interested in shark attack than in laundry bag boy himself. I have read mountains of prose in my time books upon books upon books, but never have I fallen so deeply under the spell of a fictitious being. Despite looking from some angles, like an incompetent portrayed of the columnist Peter Hitchens, laundry bag boy with his aforementioned yellow hair and blazing eyes, and his pet pig Douglas and his conjured up air fresheners. And these laundry bag stand in my view, above the heads of Emma Bovary or Oscar crease or Santo Panza or Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, or Hans cast drop, or Molly bloom or Murphy or mulloway or Malone, or Tyrone's Lothrop, or Dr. slop or the widow wadman or Ishmael or Ahab or pangloss or Percival bastle booth, or Bartleby the Scrivener, or trilby, or Svengali, or Hazel Blears, or Greg or sanza, or Don fabric to corbera prints of Selena or Batman or Robin the boy wonder, or Robin Hood or Humphry clinker or Pitbull, Magwitch or jack Free firming, or as an as white, or the Mad Arab Abdul alhazred or pinky brown or Charles Swan or Quentin derwood or Martin chuzzlewit or Phu manku or thousands of other fictional characters. He is a true superhero, and yet has a humanity that is palpable, not literally palpable. Of course, that would be stretching my enthusiasm too far. But figuratively, or so I would ever and had already avert during that very first skim reading, sheltering from the rain under the ruined bandstand in the park. As I became transfixed by the adventures of laundry bag boys shock attack years. When I got home, I reread the comic with closer intention three or four times, I think, I learned more about laundry bag Boy, that he had many more soup powers, and ones that made the air freshener things seem like a party trick. He could, for example, meld his brainwaves with those of Douglas the pig, giving him an extra human perspective on any given situation. He could count the number of pins in a pin cushion with unerring accuracy in a split second, from behind a dry stone wall. His head, including the yellow Heron, blazing eyes, could expand to four times its normal size for up to an hour at a time. Secret flaps in his laundry bag could be manipulated in such a way that it was turned into an inflatable dinghy with plastic oars, a couple of emergency flares, a compass operative on this and other planets and a waterproof cabin for the pig. Strictly speaking, possession of such a laundry bag is not a superpower as such, it smacks more of the kind of gadgetry deployed by fictional spies, such as James Bond, who was of course, named after an ornithologist, author of birds of the West Indies, first published in 1936, and in its fifth edition, still in print today. Or, on one page of the comic, laundry bag boy, it seems studying a copy of bond book while loafing backstage at a shark attack concert. This appears to be wholly gratuitous. There's no important plot development hinged upon it, and indeed, there is a marked absence of any other ornithological content whatsoever. There are not even any birds even in the sky, always depicted as, as a uniform, pale, blue cloudless, flat and artificial. I soon learned that such a sky is a constant throughout the canon, for I was so enthused by the shark attack years that I took myself off to a specialist supplier of comic books, and bought as many other laundry bag boy titles as I could fit into my own non laundry bag. Regrettably, Most, if not quite all of the stories had a subplot related in some way to jazz funk, though not specifically to Shaq attack.

And yet this did not dim my GUI. I deduced that either the writer or the artist. Neither of whose names appeared in any of the comics, as far as I could see, was a devotee of that devilish music and lack the self control to expand their aberrant leanings from the otherwise stupendous stories. Yet how often we forgive writers and artists for what after what are after all, minor irritant. For example, I've never been able to stomach Denis bear Ponte infuriating habit of conflating dish cloth with other kinds of rags and sponges, yet, I'm still able to enjoy his verse for it, vigor and punctilious. I feel the same about laundry bag boy matches, I might wish that William Holsteins bassoon Sonata se could stand as a substitute for true colors by level 42. Another thing I've noticed about laundry bag boy is that he never blinks. This might be a limitation of the cartoon strip medium, or it might be His eyes are Uber eyes, piercing and all seeing and never for a moment at rest. And there is a lot for him to look at all The quality of the drawing is scrappy and fumbled, occasionally looking as if created by a cracking on a damaged extra sketch. Throughout the series, there is an incredible amount of detail. The sky might be shown as flat and birthless and cloudless. But everywhere else in these pictures is a magnificent clutter of things. To take a picture at random, consider the opening frame from laundry bag boy gets into the groove with Herbie Hancock issue for volume 28. examining this with a winckelmann scope reveals in a rectangle taking up half the page, potatoes bloaters the width stone of brazing Goodman 14 hours dental floss diagrams, cotton pins, pork grind furballs rotating things custard Mark shoe laces, coat hangers, an aerodrome flame retardant fabric sampled snapping cap tin cans, a glazed bowl, a Viking helmet, a syrinx a rickshaw deeth pots and pans, advance covered Nazis golden tooth mug, Bunsen burners and other burners a tea strainer, a fence post, gravel cloth sand effluvium ectoplasm, railings, or brothers Johnson compilation compact disc, basil, Hornet dust tweaking mechanisms, a pile of lug worms, a dictaphone belt, sandpaper, grimy unpleasantness, winches and pulleys, talcum powder, Country and Western paraphernalia, laws, injuries, screwdrivers, shredded wheat, box cutters basho truck holders, shipping timetables phosphorescence a spider's web a fountain pen, mysterious hat like object which are not hats, a basin a dimity strap, a bathtub, a shukri a be an ice bucket, an immortal a puppet, a puppet crow with one eye button dangling loose, a puppet cow.

It really is extraordinarily packed with detail. laundry bag boy himself does not appear in this opening frame of the cartoon, and orders Herbie Hancock. The absence The beginning is a crucial part of the plot. But I won't spoil it for you by explaining why.

While I was buying up back numbers in the comic shop, I took the opportunity to pump the proprietor for more information about laundry bag boy. Increasingly, the shop was run not by a geeky nerdy nerd geek, the kind we tend to associate with such establishment. But by a batty Crone with a Quaker, we air about her. Her hair was white and wild, and she had a decided plum in her mouth. She was kind enough to offer me from a somewhat battered tin, a choice of arrowroot and Garibaldi biscuits to match while I browse the cardboard boxes packed with comics unlikely as it seemed, she knew everything there was to know about my newfound fictional hero, a walking encyclopedia of laundry bag boy law and learning our karma and in ponder abilities, facts and figures. One thing she told me in particular have me quite perplexed. In spite of the popularity of the yellow haired, blazing eyed superhero, there was no official World Wide fan club to which I could apply this thing the nomis when there are such organizations devoted to virtually everyone you can think of from fictional detective such as Sherlock Holmes and sola Pons, to real detectives, like Ian Blair and karg pan of the yard. From Sid gravel band talk to Rock Hudson, from Lascelles Abercrombie to Spider Man. from Mike Huckabee data and Rand from booth Brutus Maximus to Popeye, from Arianna Huffington to Ringo Starr from Krishnan guru Murthy to choose day weld. Yet in this seething maelstrom of often ill advised fandom, there was an unfathomable void where laundry bag boy ought to have been. I've decided to correct this preposterous state of affairs. Tomorrow at 5:15am sharp, I will be striding onto a podium by the perimeter fence of Pang Hill our sanctuary and announcing the formation of the official laundry bag boy fan club. If you're unable to be there, please write to me at hooting dock yard@gmail.com with Josh it's about time laundry bag boy had his own fan club as the subject header and nominate yourself for an official post in the organization. You can make up your own grand grand sounding title. A roster of fan club officers will be posted on the site and badges will be issued in due course.

But before we go as an extract from Mr. Key shorter, potted, brief, brief lives, my book of 500 plus very brief, potty biographies. This week, Francesca Mati Swiss animal communication expert 21st century when a cow named evil went missing in Bavaria in 2011. Those concerned for her welfare were grateful to Francisca Mati, who was in telepathic communication with her. I spoke to Yvonne yesterday, and she said that she was fine, but didn't feel ready to come out of hiding. She said she knew that urns had been waiting for her, but the that she was scared. She said she thought that humans would lock her up, and she would no longer be free. Ernst was a bull with a deep baritone Moo. Yvonne was eventually found and taken to a cow sanctuary. So it all ended happily, just like this week's episode. Bye bye.
