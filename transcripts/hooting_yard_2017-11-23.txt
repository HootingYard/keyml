Frank Key  00:01

Unknown Speaker  00:19
You are hearing me and you are listening to resonance 104 point four FM. This is Miss blossom part which is knitting half hour with me your host, Miss blossom Partridge, and I'd like to thank you all for tuning in today. Having spent the day getting getting hair with a young man on the bus, he was a new knitter. It occurred to me that we should start our show today with a knitting tip. Someone asked me earlier in the week about seeming shoulders, and although you can use a kitchener stitch or graft shoulders together, if you're seeming shoulders it's actually better to go with a traditional backstitch This adds a lot of structure to

Frank Key  01:02
me. Hello, excuse me. I think you might have come in at the wrong time. Were you meant to be in the studio? Now?

Unknown Speaker  01:14
This is Miss blossom partridges knitting half hours it not

Frank Key  01:17
No, it's this is hooting yard on the air

Unknown Speaker  01:21
with Miss blossom Park which is nothing half hour well.

Frank Key  01:25
We could do a mash up but I suppose but I think he come in. I think this is heating yard on the air with me Frank key and it's not miss bras and partridges knitting half hour I'm sorry.

Unknown Speaker  01:40
Well, I'm sorry to you too, but I am Miss blossom Partridge and I thought this was my knitting half hour.

Frank Key  01:47
Well, it's not your knitting half hour is my mighty bros half hour.

Unknown Speaker  01:53
Okay, I think I'm going to go back to my knitting unit.

Frank Key  01:58
You sit in it and I'll read stories to the listening public

Unknown Speaker  02:03
and I'd like to apologize to my listeners Sarah I'm very sorry that I can't give you more tips tonight but Mr. Key has obviously overruled me.

Frank Key  02:11
Well, it's my it's my half hour. Not not miss blossom partridges.

Unknown Speaker  02:18
Mr. Key take it away.

Frank Key  02:20
I will take it away. I will take it away. I hope you enjoyed that little drama. That was that was an impromptu drama. And the part of Miss blossom Partridge was played by Miss blossom Partridge herself. And if you'd like some actual knitting tips, she can give you some real missing tips. Maybe we'll have a well maybe we'll have a new thing till later in the show. Anyway, yes, this is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key. And what I'd like you to do is picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. You are wearing a pair of round gold rimmed granny glasses. Beside you in the boat is your wife, an avant garde artist from faraway Japan. You turn off your mind relax and float downstream. Then you turn your mind back on just a tad just enough to Imagine no possessions. You wonder if now would be an opportune moment to raise with your wife that malarkey about her acquiring a second apartment solely for the storage of her collection of coat. You open your mouth to speak. But what comes out is gibberish. Goo Goo Goo joob you blurt. Your wife looks at you as if you've taken leave of your senses. Which To be frank, you probably have. Perhaps Bernard my brain was right when he wrote that there was nothing wrong with you that could not be cured by standing you upside down and shaking you gently until whatever is inside your head falls out. It strikes you that such a maneuver would be perilous if performed in a boat on a river. Your wife who would have to turn you upside down is diminutive. And it is likely that if he made the attempt, both of you would topple over capsizing the boat and forcing you to swim to the river bank. There are apparently tails of the riverbank, but you did not write them. Nor did you write tales of topographic oceans. But you did write about that famed ocean going sailor Sir Walter Raleigh, who you described as a stupid get you pronounced rally as rally. Nowadays people will usually pronounce it as a rally, but in his own time, his name was universally pronounced Raleigh. The project Creation of surnames is important. I have heard tell that an alarming number of young persons confuse you with the Bolshevik psychopath Lenin. These are presumably the same young persons who confused Clarice Starling. The be FBI agent played by Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs with your successor. starlin. Oops, I meant Lenin's successor, not yours. Now I'm getting things all mixed up in my head, just like you. Well, you wrote a lot of nonsense too.

Frank Key  06:06
Went to Wivenhoe. I'm so I'm so perplexed by the presence of Miss blossom Partridge at my side. Still my beating heart that I couldn't even get the third, third word of that sentence right. I'll start again. Imagine the music. If I had no possessions, imagine the music. Take two. I went from Wivenhoe to cuxhaven. By way of ponders and for the journey I wore upon my head a hat woven from the hair of gorgeous hairy beasts, and a pair of goggles. Otherwise, I was dressed in the sort of suit you might see Edward G. Robinson wearing in a film noir with accompanying Spats. It was suggested to me that I might take in nunhead and snodland along the way, but I had no time. I had no time. Other than the sea crossing for which I commandeered a skiff and its Skipper, I walked the entire route. Whenever I became exhausted, I slept upon the ground under the bowl of night. I would like to say that I grew familiar with the stars, but I did not. Unless it was cloudy as it often was. I could see countless stars twinkling above me, but they appeared randomly scattered, and I was never able to discern any patterns. I always woke up with strands of hate in my hair. Wherever I had slept. I used my gorgeous woven hat of hair as a pillow. Though I was walking rather than cycling, I carried with me a bicycle pump. Often I pumped it pointing ahead of me as an exercise drill, and also as a means of dispersing gangs of gnats or midges hovering in the air. Sometimes I fancied I could hear their faint insect shrieked as they were washed out of my path. I refreshed myself with water from duck pond. I tried to keep a steady pace. There were times when I felt the bile rising in my throat. Whenever this happened, I stopped walking, sat on the ground, took my journal from the pocket of my film noir suit and wrote a memorandum. Here is an example. I am no longer in Wivenhoe 10 minutes ago walking along a buskey Lane lined by what I think are plain trees. I pumped to the pump at a cloud of midges scattering them. Shortly afterwards, I felt the bile rising in my throat. Above me The sky is wonderfully blue and dotted with the limits. swooping sweeping. Tonight it will be dotted with stars. The stars do not swoop they stay where they are far away in the cold universe so far away that the limits can never reach them and nor can I but I can reach cuxhaven by way of ponders end and must do so quickly. While there is still time. The act of writing in my journal always made the bile subside and I was able to press on. When it was humid my goggles steamed up. I carried on walking as if in a mist. When I came to a stream or a reel, I would take off the goggles and dip them briefly in the water and wipe them dry on one of my film noir sleeves. Sometimes a true engulfing mist would descend. Then I would get down on my knees even if I even if where I was was muddy and take from my pocket my little wooden God and prop it against a stone and beseech it. Here is an example Have the seat King. own little wooden God propped up against a stone. I beseech you to sweep away this engulfing mist and to make visible my path so that I might walk on fearlessly towards cuxhaven by way of ponders end. Uber, goober. himmelfarb, Farber goober. The last four words were my incantation, designed to assuage my little wooden God and have it do my bidding. My bidding was always done, for the air would clear sooner or later, and if the land was flat, I could see for miles. One day I was able to see ponders end far in the distance, and on another day, I saw the sea, and once I was on the sea, being skipped across it by an energetic Skipper in his skiff. I saw kesavan just in time.

Frank Key  11:02
I paid the skipper to skip me across the sea. He refused to skip me otherwise, I had no cash, no checkbook, no debit or credit card, not even shells or beads or trinkets, but I had honey along my journey from Wivenhoe to the coast by way of ponders end. I had paused whenever I passed an apiary and snaffled honey from beehives. I collected in pouches strung around my waist attached to a cord hidden under my film was sued some of the honey I ate to keep myself from fainting. But I was careful to keep some aside for I did not expect to be skipped across the sea for nothing. My offer to pay the skipper in honey was met with great civility, even delay. I knew that if ever I made the return journey from cuxhaven to Wivenhoe by way of pandas and perhaps able to take in nunhead and snodland. Given that I would no longer be pressed for time, I would be accosted by several irate beekeepers, demanding recompense for their stolen honey. I had time enough in cuxhaven to work out a way to repay them. If time passed and my head remained empty of ideas. I could prop my little wooden guard against the cuxhaven stone and procedure it for a brainwave. If all else failed, I could stay in cuxhaven and never go back to Wivenhoe through all the days of my life. Yet conscience told me this was wrong. It was one thing to be holed up in cuxhaven quite another to be holed up in cuxhaven tormented by guilt that good honest beekeepers have been robbed by my own honey snaffling hand. Yes, it was true that I bought a bee stings, but I had suckler venom and spat it out and rubbed my hands with doc leaves. I still had doc in my pocket. Should the bees of cuxhaven have acne with their stings? I hoped they would not for our resolve not to take their honey in cuxhaven I had sausages

Frank Key  13:46
we're gonna have a knitting tip for Miss Botham Partridge

Unknown Speaker  13:50
Oh, welcome back listener, as well as apologizing to my own listener. I'd like to apologize to Mr. Keys listeners. Suffice to say it's very, very difficult to carry on a show when someone has needles. That brings me to my tip, which is that I'm often asked, Would you Is it better to use wooden needles or metal needles. And of course, this is entirely a matter of personal preference. Although you may find it easier if you're knitting with certain fibers for example, bamboo or silk or some Cotton's that are very slippery. Using a wood needle can actually give you a bit of added friction and and make the stitches stay on the needle more easily. If on the other hand, you're using a sort of grippier or rougher yarn. Again, having a smoother needle like a metal needle can make it easier to move the yarn along. Another good tip is to store your needles in a jar that's full of rice, particularly if you wouldn't need it. Excuse me.

Frank Key  14:54
Is that true? Yes. It's really

Unknown Speaker  14:56
Yes, it really is. The rice index Little bit like pebbles in a vase with flowers. The rice keeps the needles upright. And if there wouldn't it also stops them from getting too damp. It keeps the humidity down. Basma? Well, this is it, john, you know, sorry, john is our engineer who's patiently

Frank Key  15:19
our engineer, my engineer, not you. You're not you can't just come into the studio.

Unknown Speaker  15:25
This is still my half hour. I know. But it is still my half hour.

Frank Key  15:30
I think we should let the listeners decide.

Unknown Speaker  15:33
Okay, well, let's decide

Frank Key  15:34
if you'd want to vote on whether you want hooting out on the air or miss blossom partridges, knitting half hour, press seven now. That means seeing

Unknown Speaker  15:46
as Mr. Key has many, many more listeners than I do, I'll give him that. But I would like to say two things. The first is to all of you, fellow Americans. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, and the second is, is to all of you who remember those great moments in history. Today is the day after a very important anniversary, which is one of Mr. Mr. Keys fixations as I recollect.

Frank Key  16:11
It's the day after the 54th anniversary of the assassination of john F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza in Texas in Dallas, Texas. I know many of you would probably like to make your own scale model of Dealey Plaza, out of plasticine and cardboard, and if you'd like to do that, you'll find full instructions on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org well, very many thanks to miss blossom Partridge for those exciting missing tips, especially the one about sticking needles into a tub of rice. I don't really know how to follow that. So what I'll follow it with with older listeners will recall House of terps as an out of print pamphlet published by the malice aforethought press in 1989. That's how I recall it myself. If you ever find a copy of it on eBay, you can expect to pay quite a bit of money for it. But anyway, the other day rummaging in a medium, I came upon several sheets of Bath paper. And it was the typed manuscript of a piece also called House of terps. It bears no resemblance to the published text. It's the prologue to what I clearly intended as a lengthy narrative poem, which equally clearly, thereafter abandoned anyway for the benefit of scholars who I know devote their waking lives to poring over every syllable I've ever written here as the past fragment of the the firt, the first verse, verse version of House of terps. Nothing to do with the house of tubs you may know again written at some point in the late 1980s. So a generation ago Welcome to the house of terps riddled with visionaries. Idiots twerps balls, pontoons, maniacs, cranks of the highest and the lowest ranks, raised and ruined, rich and poor. What brings them all to the same door, a vision of a visionary world. Each year, a pennant is unfold from the very top of the houses walled in howling wind as the mercury falls. As winter bites. Ice grips the land. Each member of our demented band bids fairly well to home kiss kin, and with a doomed and gritty grin sets forth upon a long slow trudge towards a circular Bank of slug. This sludge bank bows the trudges way to cross it takes near half a day, weighed down by netting, pig iron shoes, torna case gum, a supply of booze, branches, forks, bays and bait, all gifts for the keeper at the gate. The unfurl of the winter flag is at nine His name is crag. The House of terps depends on him. His countenance is pale and grim. His history is shadowy and obscure. He's lived here since the age of four. As he got guest workers from the slime crag makes a note of name and time scraped on the page with a blood stained hook in his huge registration book. he slams it shot, then barks go three to room 19 or 23. The guests head off on a path Have gravel for they have not yet cease to travel to house loons are further six miles trudge of a gravel and pebbles, not slime or sludge. crag remains hard by the gate until he's counted in all eight. We'll leave him there in probably dressed as we consider each mad guest. Potato Smith is sick at heart, festooned with rotten sacking. He made a fortune in fine art. his sense of humor is lacking. Curtain shriveled at five he likes to suck wood splinters. He is only just alive, but comes here every winter. Primrose leak a friend to aunt is only 32. She wears black hat, black coat, black pants. She's also known as su vote damn in summer at her house, she speaks the lingua franca she murdered Hector locked your frat house, the International banker.

Frank Key  21:08
Then there's Dr. Rufus glob the noted bandage stainer. His head looks like a Bakelite tub topped by a venti strainer. His berry has grown to a pot from eating too much custard. The other guests both him a lot, but think he cuts the mustard. Our fourth Powell has a widow's peak looked not unlike a panda. See t pucks, part duck, part Greek half blind and part green lander. She lives on a diet of grueling swaps and vats of sour beer. You can't buy those things in the shops, but crag supplies them here. Lascelles distemper, jolly has no sense of direction. He is a proper trolley and has a cork collection. He says By Jove and golly Gosh, another dumb cop phrases. He talks a huge amount of talk and he is prone to crazies. old dog mouth fits a legion. He broke his wooden legs. Like others from his region, he sets fire to hard boiled eggs cragen heya Saba, like they could share the same mother. But crag was once an orphan tyke and dog mouth has no brother. Sister girthy of the cross is a religious Nutter. She roams the land astride her house, a great a goat, a fractured butter moths have fluttered around her head in incandescent light, proof that she is not quite dead, but shining, dazzling, bright. The last of the guests, the turpentine house has crutches painted yellow, his head is cracked. He's such a louse. He's such a grotesque fellow. watch him grow warts upon his ears, watch him act agitator. He's quite as vile as he appears, Ned hellhound you will know writer. So now we've met this motley crew on with our Tale of derring do

Frank Key  23:52
okay, if I read this quickly? Should it be time to read it before the end of the show? I think yes, let go. Good evening, and thank you for your warm welcome. Well warmish, the clapping petered out rather quickly. And I must say that other audiences and other auditoria have shown a site to more enthusiasm. But there we go. I'm not complaining. This lecture in Locke is much preferable to being out and about in all weathers in the company of sheep, dim witted and fearful beasts that they are. But I should introduce myself, my name is Bo Peep. I'm often known as Little Bo Peep, by dint of my diminutive stature. I don't mind being called Little. It's an affectionate ring. It has an affectionate ring, but I do object when some newspapers compare me to a dwarf from a vogner opera. Clearly the organizers of tonight's event expected me to be smaller than I am. What a tiny lectin the one thing most of you will know about me is that I lost my sheep. I do not deny it. Quite why it caused such a kerfuffle in the press is a mystery to me. I became the poster girl for neglectful and inept Shepherd SS. And even now, I can barely leave my cottage without some mucky little country urchin calling out to me to ask where my fever is trying existence. As I welcome this opportunity to tell my side of the story. It all happened on one of those blustery, Misty weather, weather days in some god awful rustic backwater. As usual, I was sitting in a field supervising several sheep. My childhood ambition of intergalactic space travel was boldly going where no people had gone before, seemed as far off as ever bored out of my considerably acute mind. I drifted into a dose, and as I dosed, I dreamed I dreamt of the moon and the ukri the light with blue grasses prickled my ankles and I simply could not see where to get to through the fumi spirit has missed the moon drag the sea off great like a dark crime. Bells startled the sky. Eight gray tongues affirming the resurrection bombed out their names, the ukri pointed up, it had a gothic shape. The moon was my mother, her blue garments and loose small bats and owls. She was bald and wild. The message of the ukri was blackness, blackness and silence. I started awake, rubbed my eyes and saw that the sheep I was meant to be Shepherd ething was gone. My immediate hunch was that they had been abducted by a band of roaming Wagnerian dwarves. I had read of several such crimes in the daily nibelungen leader and countryside advertiser. So with the gung ho approach, for which we peeps a universally admired, or if not universally, then at least in and around seabob lead web shear. I hosted my crook and marched off to the newsagent kiosk under those pollarded wemos by the canal just before the level crossing at catch worth. It was not the advertiser that I was looking for. It so happened, but this newsagent kept in stock various 17th century tracks including de Gunn's downfall or the great idle dig up route and brunch by Roger crab. A fiery flying roll by a Baeza cop and the neck of the Quakers broken by Ludwig Magilton. The one I wanted, obviously, was the lost sheep found by Lawrence Clarkson. After a close reading of this pamphlet, I felt sure I would be able to locate my sheep and they would no longer be lost. I purchased a copy and repaired to a buskey arbiter read it. I had barely digested the opening paragraph when I was set upon by a vulgar mechanic. He was a repellent and violent filthy fellow, not unlike a Wagnerian dwarf by considerably taller. I cried Unhand me, sir, and smashed him in the face with my shepherd as his crook, nearly breaking his jaw row betide those who mess with a peep, I added, kicking him in the head as he lay sprawled and whimpering, but he's a plum trees slender shade, above us in the shining summer heaven. There was a cloud my eyes dwelt along upon, it was quite white and very high above us. Then I looked up and found that it had gone just like my sheep.

Frank Key  29:03
So I miscalculated, and I haven't got time to read the rest of that. So what I'll do is I'll read the rest of that story to you. Next week, I might repeat the final paragraph. I'd like to thank very much Miss blossom Partridge for her knitting tips. I'm not she's nowhere near a microphone so she won't be able to say goodbye. Maybe if she shouts from the corner.

Unknown Speaker  29:27
Hello.

Frank Key  29:28
Good, but not Hello, because that would be at the beginning of the show. You kind of get the hang of this radio work. Okay, that's it for this week. Bye bye.
