Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. And my name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Or if you're listening to the podcast, this is the hooting yard on the air podcast. Which of us does not wish to become a saint asked me most people, and they will readily admit that the idea of being venerated after death is a very appealing prospect. The paraphernalia of shrines and icons and relics are attractive in themselves, the more so when compared to the utter oblivion into which almost all of us will fall after death taps us on the shoulder and beckons us away. And there's the rub. Of course, you have to be dead to be a proper saint. So it's not a standard career option to discuss with your lifestyle coach or your community hub outreach advisor. I'm assuming here that you have such a coach or advisor, that you can be expected to make their very way through the complexities of our contemporary paradise Oh, pap without one. If your coach or advisor does recommend sainthood as a viable life skill to be added to your CV, they are delusional and you must cut your ties with them at once. Obviously, this will lead to a few days of chaotic rudderless, miasmic turmoil until you get a new coach or advisor, but better than a fruitless attempt to retrieve living sanctity. That said, there are certain things you can do while still alive to prepare for your canonization, depending in large part upon your general health and vigor, and taking into account any dangerous medical conditions, the path to sainthood can be a long one. And there are many pitfalls along the way. When the time comes for your suitability to join the pantheon of enshrined ones is to be assessed. Great store will be held by how you conducted yourself in various situations. It's well to be mindful of this, even when no witnesses are present to watch you comport yourself, for someone somewhere will act a tattle tale, you can be sure of that. Some activities are altogether safe in that you need not worry over much about besmirching the purity of your soul while engaged in them. Hiking to a picnic spot in an area of outstanding natural beauty and picnicking there upon while watched by sullen cows is unlikely to threaten your future sainthood. But such opportunities are surprisingly rare. And you can't spend your entire life on hikes and picnics much as you might want to. So it's important that you be aware of those occasions when it's so easy to tarnish your record. Consider for example that you're out a strolling by the railway sidings, sidings, where it's known from time to time for enormous out of control locomotives to come thundering along the track. Their drivers rendered incapable a couple of miles back by the sudden incursion into the engine cabover, darting Hawk or crow. Your Path crosses that have a baffled and woebegone often come to pick, pick primroses and peonies, to brighten it. dank hovel in the slums. What you must do is to resist the temptation to shove the orphan into the path of the oncoming train cackling easily as you do so, and thereafter twirling your mustachios like the most hackneyed of stage villains. If you follow your natural impulses and enact this terrible deed, you're doing a grave disservice to your chances of napping, that posthumous shrine where thousands will come to worship one of your bones. Instead, reach into your pocket and take out tuppence and give it to the orphan with the instruction to by itself a truck ice or a toffee apple, no longer woebegone, the orphan will scamper away towards a tuck shop while away from the path of the screeching train. Be careful, however, that the tuck shop is not on the other side of the railway sidings for then the orphan will have to cross them to purchase its treat and it may miss time it steps and under the wheels of the giant locomotive. After all, though, you would not be as culpable as if you would push the often deliberately, a forensically minded devil's advocate At a later date may twist the fact sufficiently to have your motives questioned with fateful results.

What we can learn from this example is the necessity of being aware at all times of the potential for mishap. Let us say you have an appointment to see your lifestyle coach, the new one that is not the delusional one you've dismissed. You will arrive at the skyscraper and have in your Pipi bag along with your usual jumble of Tat, a copy of the latest issue of vacuous pugger mentum magazine, in which you've highlighted an article recommending Best Buys in pointless gossamer fripperies. The purpose of the visit to a lifestyle coach is to seek you seek their counsel regarding the frippery that is just right for you. But also tucked into your puppy bag is a small canister of poison gas spray. You must be very careful when reaching into your Pipi bag at the beginning of the interview to take from it the magazine and not the canister. For if you have the latter in your hand, you're likely to aim it at your lifestyle coach and depress the knob atop the canister. Remember that poison gas is usually lethal, and you may end up having to explain your slip to both an ambulance crew and officers of the law. If an incident like this comes to light, when you're being praised for sanctity, those supporting you will have their work cut out. Most people are aware that a condition of sainthood is the performance of miracles. Pretty much every saint has at least one attested miracle to their name. So it's understandably tempting to devote some of your time on earth to learning conjuring tricks. The reasoning is that if you can, say produce a rabbit from a previously empty cardboard box, or saw a goat in half and then make it reappear whole to resounding applause from an audience of credulous minis or preschool infant, then such an act can count as your miracle. I'm afraid to say that this is drivel. The only miracles worth their salt are ones performed when you're already dead. And there's not much you can do to ensure that a crippled mendicant sprawled in front of your shrine besieging you to restore there with a limb gets up and walks away with limbs Julie and wizard a few stop at nothing want to be saints have tried to arrange for such exciting scenes to take place after their demise by bribing down at heel actors from their deathbed. But it's a ploy not without its risks and rarely succeeds. The average down at heel actor will simply flip from your side as you grow new or last and spend all the coinage on strong drink waking up some days later in a ditch with no memory of the bargain nice struck. A further pitfall for the overambitious saint to be is to be in too much of a hurry to identify the trade or beast or sickness etc, of which you would like to be patron. Most such patronage is have already been allocated. And although there are some duplications, you should not rest your hopes on any particular role. You may have your heart set on becoming the patron saint of hedgehogs, and spend much of your time doing good work among the hedgehog community, setting up sanctuaries and so forth. But this is no guarantee that you'll ever be granted your desire. Those who decide on these matters are notoriously fickle. And you may find that all those hours and days and years spent feeding milk through a funnel to injured baby hedgehogs rescued from entanglement in Bramble patches would have been better spent in the company of say, seabirds or television cat show hosts as a general rule, leader blameless life and avoid poison gas canisters, and the temptations of railway sidings

preferred advertisements now the first advertisement is for the new hooting yard book. Yes, it sounds at last. It's entitled What's it called? My mind has suddenly gone blank. It's called gravitas, punk, teleo rectitude, and Pipi bags, and it's about 340 pages long, packed with 101 stories from hooting yard, and some illustrations and perfect Christmas gift really. So, to buy your copy, go to www dot hooting yard.org and you'll see a picture of the cover and click on the picture of the cover. And that'll take you to where you need to go to buy your copy. And you can only buy online I'm afraid. But yes, so by that, here's the second divert. trumpets, patterned rarefied pig fat and sourdough paste comes in handy tubes. Spread thickly on a digestive biscuit, or between two slices of sliced up solidified milk sludge it makes for a perfect picnic snack. You will well know if ever you've been held responsible for the packing of a picnic hamper the difficulty of picking the appropriate picnic snacks. how common it is to be sat in a meadow pipe clenched in your teeth moustache bristling to be lambasted by your fellow picnickers as the picnic hamper is unpacked, and harsh words are said about say the sausages or the unsliced on solidified milk sludge. Many an idyllic picnic has been destroyed before it's even properly begun. Because of hamper contents fury many Meadows have resounded with unseemly implications. Many moustache ends have been tweaked with spiteful tugs by the fingers of furious picnickers reaching across the picnic rug to assault the hamper Packer. It is a sorry state of affairs, but one which trumpets aims to make a thing of the past. Our pastes are beyond reproach. We have been manufacturing pastes in tubs and tubes for over half a century from our paste works in pointy town, old Park trumpet who founded the firm and whose moustache was as magnificant magnificent as an example of the walrus variety as as ever been grown in this town made it his business to end picnic unpleasant list good and proper. It is easy to chuckle at those early promotional leaflets with their clunky slogans such as there will be no more unwarranted tweaking of mustaches at picnics when you pack trumpets paste in your picnic hamper but they bespeak a great moral purpose. It was a time when Meadows were loud with the din of mustachioed men wearing boaters pipes clenched between their teeth, venting their fury at the choice of snacks packed into their picnic hampers. bonneted ladies blushed and held their dainty hands over their ears, and in some cases swooned. into this Maelstrom stepped old Park trumpet with PASTE SPECIAL specifically designed to bring due decorum to our meadows. For more than 100 years now, the firm that still bears his name has continued to manufacture exciting and toothpastes usually quite edible for use at picnics. We're proud to do so.

So universally is the author of Tales told by an idiot known as the Potsdam windbag. In a new anthology of his work, his real name does not even appear, not even on the garish dust jacket. I have to confess that I do not know what that name is. And nor have I bothered to find out. I could have consulted an encyclopedia, or a dictionary of 19th century Teutonic bloviating. But I'm currently adopting an era of foppish latitude, and I could barely bring myself to squelch across the sodden fields to the railway station to collect the copy of the book that had been left there for me in a postal pouch, by a postal pouch person in person. By the railway but bestow myself I did during one of our recent thunderstorms. And that's for the past week I've been overjoyed to reacquaint myself with the pros of a true master. Admittedly, it's difficult to say of what precisely the Potsdam wind bag is a master. His stories are baffling, pointless, often idiotic and grind on pitiless length. One example included in the new book, The Tale of something or other, I have not yet worked out what it is, though. prates on for over 400 pages before stopping abruptly in the middle of an ungrammatical sentence. Perhaps that's not fair. That is a sort of grammar at work, but it's one unique to the Potsdam windbag. He wrote exclusively in fractured English rather than in his native tongue, despite never leaving his beloved Potsdam nor ever, so far as we know, communicating with any English speakers. One of the most arresting facts about him is that when he died, his extensive library was found to contain Not a single word in English, except those he'd written himself in mind did he write this new anthology is so hefty that I have to hire a peasant and his cart to carry it back across the field. The thousands of pages of dense, sometimes incomprehensible prose are a mere fraction of the Potsdam wind bags outpourings, estimated to run to more millions of words, that then the combined works of hundreds of other wind bags whose forgotten and unread books happily clog the bookshelves of our proper libraries. Now the surprising thing surprising to me at any rate, was that the peasant to hold the tome home for me in his cart was steeped in the writings of the Potsdam windbag. When he was growing up in a bear cabin in the forest, a paperback of the popular selection tales told by an idiot with the only book his parents owned his father, a woodcutter had been an autodidact who had taught himself to read through persistent study of the text, and thereafter read the tales, his bedtime stories to the peasant throughout and indeed beyond his childhood. This I thought might account for the strangulated vowel sounds and guttural grunts which littered his speech patterns. We were talking the peasant and I over a shared bowl of soup at my kitchen table for having hired him for the casting and enjoyed his company. I was loath to watch him vanish into the downpour. In fact, he hasn't left my hat since I invited him in a week ago, and has taken to sleeping on the floor of the pantry. He told me in his favor at Potsdam windbag story. Sadly, it's not one that has been collected in the new Anthology, so I can't read it out to you here. It's an early example of science fiction, in which the world becomes convinced that a character called Stephen Fry is a super intelligent being with an all powerful brain. characteristically, our author never makes a convincing case why so many should fall under the spell of this pandemic delusion, his tears dropping into our soup. The peasant wept as he recalled the terrific sadness of the stories end, where Stephen Fry is revealed as merely an average man with a reasonably large vocabulary. I wonder if the Potsdam windbag was trying to say something about himself in the tale he called the cleverest man in the universe. His command of the language he chose to writing if eccentric is highly impressive, and as I said his work rate was prodigious. But it's one of the latest stories, and it could be that looking back on his life's work, the Potsdam windbag was seized by the thought that it was all a waste.

The biographical details are sparse. Born and died in Potsdam during the 19th century, wrote acres of clotted prose may have hobnobbed with Potsdam movers and shakers from time to time. Other than that, we know little, yet What does it matter? We have the work and in the form of this bulging anthology available to everyone with the physical strength to heave it home from bookshop or library, I hope a brand new readership who will be well rewarded and fighting their way through the coagulated morass of these teeming thousands of pages. The peasant will awake soon, we shall share soup and read to one another

artists of the past now tralala the drainage ditch is one of the four last songs by elegantly bouffant sociopath lo thar preen. It is for the majority of critics, the best of the quartet, a brain numbing racket of melodic astringency that I'm going to start that sentence again. It is for the majority of critics the best of the quartet, a brain numbing racket of melodic astringency with impasse thumping over wicker rich contralto voice sings word torn from the innermost depths of preens creative being. There's also some yodeling, which rarely goes amiss, and reminds us that priene often claimed to be channeling the spirit of Christopher Plummer in the film version of the sound of music. preen also claimed to be Swiss, which he patiently was not, but that's a matter on which a quietus should be put. It was long believed that preen wrote the four last songs in his deathbed out on a balcony in the mountains while in the final ravages of tuberculosis. New research shows that in fact, he composed these towering pieces on horseback while riding along various clifftop paths, and it was his horse that was tubercular. Armed with this knowledge, we can make much more sense of the second of the songs, the tralala Dennis's coughing up blood, Dennis, of course, being the name of preens horse. It was long believed up until a few seconds ago that lowth are praying had a horse called Dennis. I believe this myself, but I've just received a message tapped out by a spirit medium, which suggests that Prince clifftop journey was an elaborate fiction that he had a goat rather than a horse that the goat was penned in a goat pen in a field behind his shack, and he wrote the four last songs while holed up in the back room of a rough some tough seaside tavern, while avoiding the bailiff's. This has the ring of truth, as preened spent the best part of his life being pursued by bailiff's sometimes across continents. It's not clear if the goat was called Dennis, and it would be interesting to know, but the wrapping of the Spirit medium cease to suddenly as it had begun. And now the only sound I can hear is the eerie whistling of the wind in the pines are possibly the larches I can't tell one tree from another. Nor could Lowe's are praying if we accept that the words of the third song trawler, looky loo, what the hell are those things growing in the orchard? Are autobiographical? Uh, surely they must be. One curious feature of the four last songs which has exercised the brains of some of our finest musicologist is that there are only three of them. It's been proved in a breathtakingly pompous essay by Vander Blue, that lowth are praying, never even considered writing a fourth song in the set. So all those hours and days and weeks and months and years, good god years that people like me have spent rummaging in dust bins in Switzerland, hoping against hope to find a lost manuscript have been a complete waste of time. Vanda versus is a very arrogant man with suspicious stains upon his bomber jacket, but his argument is watertight, and we must all of us bow to his superior wisdom, much as it rankles to do so. That's not the only thing that rankles and high word No. But if I was to catalogue a full list of my rankle meant you would lose patience, I fear and put me down as a tiresome complaining get you would not be wrong.

I'd like to tell you about ringer Sedgwick. Sedgwick, a crony of the tapas had many toppings. Some of them were like lids and some like caps. One Of particular note was the flat one, the one that decisively lacked fears. That was unusual, but not unexpected for Sedgwick was a ringer and a truxton. One at that with the distinctive old red shawl and the calipers. His grip was firm, you could say that thin and you could say much else people did. Take a walk along the bridle path one morning just after dawn and you'll hear of little else. Even the birds making a birdie dawn didn't seem to call out his name. Although of course, that's just our human fancy at work. Any bridle paths here are about to be the same in the mornings crowded with folk who've risen early from their beds, wandering out of doors like sleepwalkers heading nowhere in particular, with no particular business. It might be the Pong of the bridle path that attracts them in there dozens woken from dreams of pigs upon gravel, always the same dream shared by so many. It's quite a wonder. After all, this is not pig country hasn't been for 100 years or so long before segs time. By the time he came along. It was all geese or otters are just vast tracts of cement. His parents had both been among those who poured the cement without much in the way of skill but with enthusiasm. You need to be keen to perform certain actions when you've not been apprentice to them. But Sedgwick knew ringing backwards he'd been trained to it. Lots were ones you'd be surprised how readily he took to it all things considered, by which things I mean his dumps and flops and clannishness. Each intern he struggled with but defeated. He was a decent man, Sam on the bridle path have a morning habit that he cannot count and never could, but they're wrong. A ringer unable to count will be a strange creature indeed, a strange in its own way as those otters that prevail were once the pigs held sway. They're not quite like any other authors, or at least any more likely to chance upon a standard river bank. Take your binoculars or a telescope and have a look. You'll see what I mean. Of all the top of cronies it Sedgwick the truxtun ringer you would want at your side if you are up a creek or in a snowdrift he was such a reliable man. It was said of him once rightly, I think that things hinged upon him of how many cannot be said most of us are rarely given the chance to be hinges and if we are there's the fear that we would not pass muster. That fear can in itself be corrosive of our hinge pneus before we've even set out upon the escapade or brouhaha in which we wish to play the hinge. But Sedgwick didn't know fear it was alien to him. Once he was pitched by a mini Madcap into a pit of scorpions and was in seussian. You may wonder how a two can chat could ever find himself in so unlikely a quandary and wonder you may until you do your homework. Remember, he was a crony of the tapas by God the best of them. There were others of course, some ringers, but most not and all have left their tracks muddy or sleety or oddly magnetic. Sedgwick tracks are were something else again. They had an a pattern or of looseness even abandoned that didn't sit well with his everyday demeanor which was forthright and abandoned. A glint in the eye the lack of fluff on the collar. When the whole of truxton was on its uppers. Sedgwick didn't crumble, and many did. Too many of the histories are to be believed. Vendors soccer coupons were exchanging hands for ludicrous sums it was that bad. There were no longer any pigs on the pig farms, just bales of hay in fields bales bale by tapper at a time when he could still move his limbs. How easy to forget. Have Ever so many tabs been stumped. So little purpose. Oh, there were portance there were simply too many birds in the sky swooping coin beating their wings more urgently than birds usually do. Only Sedgwick was prepared to Don a polythene suit and descend into the chemical vats. Pregnant women cheered him on from behind a fence. Most of them were praying you would have to No matter what your confession and that's the end of this week's show. Thank you for joining me and I'll be back next week. Bye bye
