Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. I've been reading a biography of Peter Warlock whose real name was Philip Heseltine. Peter was 1894 to 1930. English composer. Best work as far as I'm concerned is the curfew, which was a setting of a poem by wb Yeats. And it's one of the most depressing, miserable mournful pieces of music I've ever heard. Anyway, Philip has on time Peter Warlock, he was one of he was basically a combative drunkard who got into arguments with most people he ever met. But also in the late 20s, he lived in a little Kent village called eynsford in a cottage, and there's a bit in the biography the biography by the way, is called Peter Warlock the life of Philip Heseltine by Barry Smith, published in 1994. To to coincide with his centenary. Anyway, there's a great bit in the biography which I will now read to you. Close to the ruins of Ainsworth castle. Phillip shared the small Mainstreet cottage with his composer friend ej Moran, together with a collection of cats and a Maori housekeeper come factotum. How Collins, Tae akau Collins had previously been a barman at the London drinking club. Settled gray gave this intriguing description of him. In contradistinction to this more or less floating population of cats and women. A permanent member of the establishment was a strange character called how Collins, whose Mari grandmother had been a cannibal, and used within his memory to lament the passing of the good old days when she could feast upon her kind. Besides being a graphic artist of considerable talent, particularly in woodcut, he was one of those people who without ever having learned a note of music, or received a lesson in piano playing, have an inborn technical dexterity, and a quite remarkable gift for improvisation. He used to compose systematically also, but without being able to write it down. I remember him once playing to me a whole act of an opera he had conceived on the subject of Tristram Shandy. He subsisted chiefly on stout, of which he consumed gargantuan quantities, and when elated would perform Maori war dances with quite terrifying realism. On spirit, however, he would run completely a mock in true native fashion, and on one occasion, almost succeeded in massacring the entire household. Personally, I'd like to know more about how Collins but he died in 1929, the year before Peter Warlock, so something tells me we may never find out any more about him. And one of the other things one of the other things Peter Warlock like to do apart from drinking, was to go on naked motorbike rides in the night around the countryside. And yeah, anyway, during that he was of course Born in 1894. He was a exactly of the generation where thousands of his contemporaries were wiped out in the First World War. He was actually declared unfit for military service. According to a Harley Street doctor He suffered from general neurasthenia, and an inability to mixture right when mentally excited, and especially in the presence of other people, with the consequence that he has had occasional prolonged retention.

As one of the commenters on the hooting yard website pointed out, surely an inability to make sure he would have probably been killed quite rapidly by five minutes in the trenches. Anyway, as a seemingly fit young man's warning about London, he was subjected to insults from officious patriots. And his common retort to such persons was to decline one of his favorite quotations from Samuel Butler's poem, Sam of Montreal. So imagine you're an officious patriot walking the streets of London in, say, 1916 and you see this tall, fair haired young man who looks perfectly fit wandering around and you insult him and say, why aren't you in the trenches? To which he replies Oh brother in law water Mr. Spurgeon does have a Dasha, who season is also the skins of Canadian owls. Thou coolest trousers, pants, whereas I call them trousers. Therefore, thou art in Hellfire, on May the Lord PTV.

As another person commented on the blog that's similar to George melies. The young George Melly, when threatened by ruffians used to take out of his pocket a copy of a book of poetry by Kirsch, fitters, and declaim nonsensical babble to them and the ruffins would run away thinking within a matter last week, on the show, you may well of course you remember because all of this stuff is engraved on your brain, isn't it? But that you'll recall a piece tungsten greed, and unfortunately that contained an error, which rendered it incomprehensible and as a consequence, the hooting yard incoming postage logistics silo was bombarded with untold thousands of letters from listeners expressing bafflement, befuddlement, and in some cases, complete indifference. I've now taken the opportunity to reread re re read and re re re re read too many reads there the text I scanned it through a botsman scope, subjected it to the pegwell Farmington test and carried out several other procedures that you need not bother your ungainly little heads about and as a result of my labor's which I can assure you we're herculean, I'm now able to announce that if you replace the word tungsten grieb, in the text with the word zinc ygritte, all becomes clear. Well, it's not exactly clear then, let us say, less misty.

I recently came across a fictional character named somewhat foolishly Ziggy Stardust, the creation of a one time student of mine named David Bowie. Among the attributes of Mr. Stardust, we are told that he is like a leper Messiah. I wonder if there was a real non fictional leper Messiah Mr. Bowie had in mind or given that he uses the indefinite rather than the definite article, whether there might actually be several such messiahs languishing in leper colonies across the globe. One way to find out would be to make a tour of leper colonies where they still exist in countries including India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, Vietnam, and Your pan before planning such an arduous itinerary, I did some background reading on this to Bali and I discovered that he had often expressed an interest in the last name of those nations, Japan. Somewhere he spoke of being under Japanese influence, and elsewhere have pictures of jack girls in synthesis, whatever that means. I also learned that he had once been buried up to his neck when pretending to be an inmate of a second world war Japanese prisoner of war camp. I caution I, these clues were enough for me to dismiss any thought of traveling to India, China, Romania, Egypt, Nepal, Somalia, Liberia, or Viet Nam, and to focus all my attention on the Land of the Rising Sun. It seemed fairly clear that if there were indeed one or more leper messiahs, they were almost certainly to be found in a Japanese leper colony. impatient to proceed with my quest, I jumped into her Japanese car and told the driver to take me to the airport. Instead, he drove me to a forest in the Japanese car and left the hole in the back of my head, hiding in the foliage and Pete, it was wet, and I was losing my body heat. Mr. Bowie spoke of his honor being at stake when he was under Japanese influence. But for me, it was more a case of injured pride or nearly. And to make matters worse, I was nowhere near Japan, nowhere near even the airport. What price and now my important research into Japanese leper messiahs. Anyway, stumbling through the foliage I came upon some picnickers along with their hamper, and rug and folding chairs and cans of wasp repellent. They had a cassette deck, it was playing pop tones. I cocked an ear and listened carefully, hoping it might be one of Mr. Bowie songs about Mr. stardust. But alas, it was not. Good afternoon, I said to the picnickers or rather shouted to make myself heard above the din of pop tones. This is something of a long shot, I said, but I don't suppose you all hail from a nearby leper colony. Actually, we do, said one munching on a sausage. I was both pleased and surprised to notice that he was a decidedly oriental appearance. Indeed, in spite of the rain, he was wearing a kemono my I join your picnic? I asked. I'm famished. Wait a moment, he said, which you'll have to ask permission. From whom? I asked. He pointed towards a tent which had been erected some yards away to the east. Our almighty lord and master dwells within that tent. He said, We must seek His guidance in all things, including whether you may join us in our picnicking he swallowed another chunk of sausage. Oh, still my beating heart. Could it be that I had somehow located the leper Messiah picnicking in the British countryside. My I come into the tent with you. I asked. I'm afraid not said the Japanese picnic leper. But you may wait at the 10th flap. So I did and quite against protocol. I took the opportunity to peek inside. And I was astounded by what I saw. The leper Messiah was not Japanese after all. There in the gloom of the 10th I saw dressed in Scarlet and gray sitting beside a Telly with his tiny hands on his tummy. chuckling away. A leprous laughing No.

Last night I dreamed I went to pointy town again. I went by way of the blister lane bypass where important roadworks were taking place. In spite of the fact that I have never in my life been within 20 feet of a pneumatic drill. I took it into my head that I wished with all my heart to take Party in the roadworks. I hopped off my bus a number 666 dogs through the many container lorries thundering along the road in both directions, and an end, a muddy trench grabbed hold of an unattended machine tool. With shore and steady thumb, I depress the knob that spurned the machine to life, and proceeded to gouge out crumbly slabs of geological significance from the bottom of the trench. This being a dream, I was able to continue my deft roadworks until I reached the burning core at the center of the earth. I still have my machine and dug through the final layers of rock fragments with my bare hands. And there I discovered an egg. This is the egg of the world, I said, I wonder what will hatch from it. With the egg nestled in a pocket of my Tyrolean jacket, I clambered back up to the earth surface. Oddly, instead of finding myself at the blister lane bypass, I was in pointy town itself, near the viaduct outside the old collapsing abandoned swimming pool. The door was ajar, and I pushed it open without the least trace of fear and stepped inside. As I did, so, I heard the egg in my pocket crack in the empty pool with it, distorting acoustics, a jug band, as if awaiting my arrival, struck up a gunk band arrangement of Mother Goose by Jethro towel. Was it a goose egg I had in my pocket. I fumbled in my pocket to hoist out the cracking egg, but something nipped my fingers and I quickly pulled that my hand eggless blood was flowing far more copious Lee than one would expect from the tiny bite I had received. I waved my hand and my blood splattered the jug band. They played on undisturbed. That's the thing about dreams. They make no sense. They have no significance. I'm not even sure what a jug band is. I've never engaged in Rogue roadworks. I've never been to pointy town.

JOHN, my sound engineer just asked me if I've ever been to funky town. Actually, john, I have. And I'm going to tell you all about that next week. And as you remember everything, listeners, you'll be waiting awaiting tales of funky town. Next week. Well, we'll see what we can come up with. I don't often write poetry but here's a poem to be you can you can memorize this and next time you're at a sort of poetry gathering. And you're called upon to perform a poem. You can do this one. I don't know if you ever go to poetry gatherings I certainly did. Last time I went to a poetry gathering. I was thrown out by a poetry fascist or something anyway. Here it is. eerie old barn wherein I lay sprawled the farm that it stands on what is it called? It goes by the name of screwin hunahpu farmyard. There you see, that was not so hard. But other questions we might raise in these squalid sordid days in this airy barn of Whoa, have answers we will never know.

After they scooped out most of my vital innards. The surgeons replaced them with Bish Bosch, artificial substitutes made from an amalgam of rubber on wire and tin and concrete. Then they seal that the slicing is they had made earlier lifted me from the operating table and placed me into some sort of translation And jelly poured there was a blinding flash of light. And the next thing I knew I was back in bed in my pajamas in my chalet I unbuttoned my pajama jacket, expecting to see scars, but I was completely unmarked. Now from that account, you might think I'm describing the experience of being abducted by aliens. We know how fun they are of carrying out intrusive surgery for their own implacable purposes. Forgive me if I gave the wrong impression. What actually happened was that I woke up in my pajamas, in my bed in my chalet and I felt distinctly peaky. Now usually when I'm peaky, I swallow a glog of Dr. Baxter's invigorating syrup, but on this particular morning, my pickiness was beyond the pale one Grog, then another did nothing to alleviate it, and so I thought it best to consult my doctor. As it happens, his surgery is perched rather higher up the mountain slope than is my chalet. So by the time I staggered into his waiting room, I was pickier still, I was so peaky it beggars belief. When eventually I was ushered in to see Dr. Fang, he took one look at me and gawped. Good heavens, he cried. Seldom have I encountered so piki a patient, you may be mere minutes from death. Watch now, as I proved my metal Tapping Machine and summon a hot air balloon to ferry you immediately to my exciting new research clinic even higher up the mountain slope. There my unpaid interns will carry out innovative and as yet untested procedures to obliterate all traces of pickiness and have you back on your feet in no time. Moments later, the door crashed open and a gaggle of said unpaid interns. All white coats and stethoscopes and burning enthusiasm dragged me out and into the basket of their hot air balloon. At this point, my penis reached a new pic and I lost consciousness and you know the rest. The point is, do I feel any better? It's difficult to judge. Admittedly, I haven't yet attempted to rise from my bed, in part because my new artificial innards seem to weigh considerably more than those they replaced, which I lost or tossed into a wastepaper bin in the clinic. Perhaps the extra weight I think it's the concrete. Perhaps the extra weight on our carry is Dr. fangs rooster. Build that my strength. But I'm also rather alarmed at the terrific rate at which my rubber and why and tendon concrete heart is pounding. I seem to have acquired the metabolic rate of a squirrel. That might be a good thing. Of course, I will be more alert. Though constant quivering may prove socially ruinous. Dr. Fang has promised to pay me a chalet visit tomorrow, during which we will check my progress. I might also find out if there is any truth in the rumor that his experimental surgery is in fact part of a dastardly plan to breed a race of half men half robotic auto martyr, with whom he intends to conquer the world. I think I saw on his bookshelf, a ring binder on the spine of which was written plan for global Dominion through the agency of robots squirrel people. I think I had best asked him if I could borrow it. Now I think I'll eat some nuts for supper.

I've got a horrible feeling. I've actually run out of material for this week's show with six minutes left to go. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to read you a couple more extracts from Barry Smith biography of Peter Warlock neither of which have anything to do with Peter Warlock at all. Apparently, wb Yeats, I'm not entirely sure I know very much about Yeats other than that he, at one point got into automatic writing, under the influence of Madame blavatsky. Anyway, apparently, wb eight, employed a sensor, to if anyone wanted to set any of his poems to music, that you had to submit your setting to this censor, who would either you know, agree them or more More likely, refuse permission for your your musical setting. Why Yeats didn't actually undertake this task himself, I have no idea. But anyway, he had this center and the origin of his reluctance to have his poetry set to music. According to Barry Smith was as follows. It was born of his horror at being invited by a certain composer to hear a setting of his the lake isle of Innisfree, a poem which voices a solitary man's desire for still greater solitude. And in this setting, it was sung by a choir of 1000 Boy Scouts. So that's mildly amusing. The idea of a poem about solitude. So I'd like one of my poems to be sung by a choir of 1000 Boy Scouts I wonder if I can arrange that there's nothing resonance can't do. I'll get Ed Baxter onto the onto it immediately. And I'm sure we can, you know, with his with his ability to get people to do things I'm sure we can do that. And the other the other quotation is about Berlioz. When Berlioz was found wandering about the mountains, notebook in hand, sketching his over quarter King Lear, he was arrested as a spy. And his protest that he was not making note in a secret cipher were received with ridicule by the police. It is well known, they said that music cannot be composed without a piano forte. Berlioz we know, could not play the piano forte, but his case provides no rule. And the fact remains that a great deal of music especially at the present time, is either extemporize at the keyboard, or else built up of fragments discovered more or less fortuitously at the piano forte, and afterwards unskillful II glued together I wonder if that's still the case. I suppose nowadays a great deal of music is extemporize that the guitar anyway, that is that is the end of this week's show. I think it's been a very educational one actually. You've learned much mostly about Peter Warlock, but also about Berlioz web eight, David Bowie, and no one else can think of that I mentioned. So I'll go away now and I'll be back next week, but hopefully with half an hour's worth of material. Bye bye.
