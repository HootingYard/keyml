Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. And over the years, I've been on this show, I've occasionally read extract from one of my I say one of my favorite books, possibly my favorite book ever. longtime listeners will recall excerpt from further science book 20, by Norman Davis, published in 2001. It's a little spineless pamphlet with a yellow cover, obviously, self published by whoever by Norman Davis, whoever he might be. And it's just fantastic. And I thought that rather than reading extract, I would read the entire book to you, or at least as much of it as I can read. In the next 28 minutes or so. Yeah, I found this in a secondhand bookshop on Charing Cross Road many years ago. And I have no other information about it. I will put out my plea, as I often do when, when reading bits from this book, as I said, it's called further science book 20. If anyone has books, one to 19, should they actually exist? Please send me a copy. And Norman Davis, if you're listening, you could possibly send me the entire run. If you're still alive, of course. Yes. So without further ado, I'm going to read to you further science book 20. by Norman Davis, published by Norman Davis in 2001. mammal bone structure. One, that backbone segment consists of two opposite fused bone forms. The single half moon round plate welded to the multi jag formation to while the winds protrude at the change point from narrow neck to wide rib cage structure via the shoulder blade plate with the ribs expanded to the contracted tail bones via the hip plate. Three, the skull closed plate is opposite to the hips, open plates and a bone circular hole blocks off two of the three tail sections to enable legs etc. For that these small liquids in testing over contract in contrast to the overexpansion of the large light solids in testing, five while the single smooth stomach contrast with the multi Angular segmented pancreas six that digestion also occurs in threes, saliva, carbohydrate, stomach pepsin proteins and 10 and sorry sick that digestion also occurs in three saliva, carbohydrates stomach pepsin proteins and renin fat with the pancreas adding three enzymes one for each with additional bile for fat and the protein enzyme.

To dragon stumps are very sharp edges was the generic genetic origin of specialist carnivore teeth, etc.

This is hooting out on the air on resonance FM. And I'm Frankie and I've got a bit of a sore throat so I'm coughing a lot. I'm also reading to you further science book 20 by Norman Davis.

I'm sorry that this cough will try to suppress it. melting point sequence one that melting points in sequence from low temperature to high are seem to be in three cycles of physical form, color and attribute linked to below zero degrees melting point, Tony wean FOSS green cyanide, chlorine are poison gases acting in sunlight and via h CL and pressure over Mercury, purple blue three low plus melting point 15 to 30 degrees just above poison gases come fever hot white aspirin, Sammy silic high bad smelling putrid wine sense etc. urea, white fat, white needles albumin declines decline and precipitation burning taste oils, ammonia carbolic and phenol disinfectants etc 440 degrees melting points bring changes to sulfuric acid affect yellow resin spermaceti fat 550 degrees melting point dark electrical light changes battery oil King Corona yellow powder right no sent read in transmitted light green reflected needles, vinegar acetic acid decline coumarin picric acid no fatigue.

the three melting point cycles are differentiated by polarity cycle one polarity deflection is to the right cycle to polarity to the left and cycle three polarity to the right again 21 so that as there are repeating three cycles of atomic Element Attribute, So likewise are there three cycles of melting point attributes, with each melting point having a different acid in the sequence melting point cycle one HCl cycle to sulfuric acid cycle three nitric acid 22. The above also explained the differences between the three acids and between fats cholesterol, explosive gas poisons and aconite et cetera et cetera.

Current theory one that matter is a sea salt expanded macro cleavers die, too, and as becoming a Blackberry, not a prickly green gooseberry also equals the basic difference between a gooseberry and a black currant, ie that black currents are of salt soiled near sewage farms. gooseberries the opposite.

While I'm clearly not going to be able to read to you all of the science book 20 Today I got completely the wrong idea of how long it would take. And I do hope you're enjoying it and though you're learning a lot so far, Today we've had mammal bone structure, local recipe map, carnivores teeth, fashion sequence, vegetable white sequence, wild Proverbs, pro anti lime melting point sequence, wild plant and current theory. And before we go this week, we've got time for Pacific Islands and I think I might just have to carry on next week. If you if you would like to hear more. Tune in next week. Ah, here's Pacific Islands. One that far west Fiji is rugged lava tooth green, fat fish cannibals. firewalking refined Indians blue eyes, blood sunset. to people to North fairer than South Tonga have oblong round their head, less fears. Naked tattoo. Most drape for forest single large oaks mist etc. Three, Tonga to South yellow we sunset undergrowth bark cloth carpet, melon pawpaws pig false happy for East to the Cook Islands. Genuine happy matchstick palm forest. Course hibiscus friends you pay me five, east to the north society aisles.

Six Austral islands to South lace brim hats, fat red vertical cause hibiscus dresses, baskets, seven east to emoto, Cavalier ferns citrus with cloud Green Blue Sea eight, East to White Sea chalky clear big separate palms, nine mangrove oblak slight barren fire bright etc. I do like the way so many of these sections end with etc as if he could go on and on. But to remember Tonga the South includes pig and between and

and that's I've just been told I've got 10 seconds left. I Bye bye. I'll be back next week.
