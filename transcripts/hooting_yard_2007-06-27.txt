Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air coming to you live from London as ever. One of the pleasures of live radio is you never know quite what's going to happen. And that includes me today. For example, I've got a terrible head cold. I'm deaf in one ear, and my tubercular coughing, maybe even more pronounced than usual. And you just have to put up with that. And let's hope it all goes well. A generation ago, the airplane pilot and sage Newman asked our friends electric. It was pertinent then and there's perhaps more so now. Over the years, many thinkers have grappled with Newman's question, but it's fair to say that none has been able to give a satisfactory answer. much publicity was generated when pill brow published his big fat Symposium on the problem. The garland did laureate of pseudo sci fi hermeneutic psychobabble persuaded over 100 movers shakers and hysterics to respond to the poser put by Newman, and then told the radio and television studios giving inaccurate summaries of their replies. Few who saw it will forget the news night appearance when pill browse pretensions were comprehensively demolished by weatherman Daniel Corbett who strode across the set from his meteorological map, I literally tore a copy of the symposium to shreds, before pill brows, and Jeremy Paxman eyes. It was a cheaply produced paperback edition of the book with weekly glued binding, but Corbett's feat was no less impressive for that. Since that watershed, there have been other muted responses to Newman appearing for the most part, tucked away in little red specialist journals, or inserted at the tail end of lectures delivered in drafty half empty civic holes in the depths of winter. The question remains cogent, the responses have almost invariably shirked its implicit challenge. Until now, for last week, Blodgett commanded space in all the major newspapers to announce his answer. Our friends, electric, no, it read in big bold letters, and then in smaller type continued, not my friends at any rate, my friends are made of gas. bloggers, Blodgett went on to describe the small band of his pals who appear to him in the form of clouds of luminous and sometimes volatiles gas, anticipating the charges that he's subject to hallucinations, he refutes it with aplomb. Blodgett gas friends shimmer around him, he says, ethereal, Mercurial and insubstantial, but boon companion Still, he gives the example of his friend, Abu kotoba, a friend composed of particularly volatile gas, and Islamic fundamentalist gas for forever railing against the iniquities of pretty much everything he disagrees with and threatening to behead sinners and Apple states and infidels. Blodgett is himself an infidel, of course. And this has led some critics to claim that he's making up all this stuff about a gang of friends made out of gas who have around him. He's keen to dispel the impression that his chumps and ghosts or race, they are as real as you are I he writes, completely human with human virtues and vices, but they're formed of gas clouds, Abu kotoba and I disagree on many points, but I count him as my friend, because I admire his striking beard, also, of course made out of gas and his amusing tendency to fly off the handle at tiny provocations. Blodgett gives fewer details of his other gas pals, although he finds room to mention Daisy blanket, a blind widow woman with a gas guide dog and, and hopper tip and ancient Egyptian gas Pharaoh. He explains that when they're not by his side, his friends flit from place to place, sometimes together in a gang and sometimes apart and try to strike up friendships with others. They have met with little success in doing so. And Blodgett puts the blame firmly at Newman's door.

intentionally or not, Neumann planted the idea in people's heads they've been future their friends would be made of electricity, he writes. Thus today, citizens are less open to the idea that they may have friends made out of gas. This is a great pity. I have found companionship and joy with my little band of gas pals. They have much to offer in the Hurly burly of contemporary life. And I urge each and every one of you to put out the hand of friendship to members of the gas community. Next time you're waiting at the bus stop and notice a cloud of luminous or volatile gas approaching you. Take that bold step, shed your new monoid prejudices and greet that gas cloud as a compadre, you can make a difference. Blodgett has been hoping to appear on Newsnight to further his cause. But the producers are somewhat wary after the pill brow incident, and have no plans to invite him onto the program.

Someone suggested to me that I should hum our friend's electric by Gary Newman and tubeway army after reading that, but I'm afraid I don't know how it goes. And so you'll have to do that. And more importantly, I've been thinking about the logo or brand for the 2012 Olympics. Clearly that 400,000 pounds design is a hideous mistake and will have to be ditched and replaced at some point within the next five years. My own view is that the organizing committee will to take a cheerful, jolly image from an already proven successful brand, slapped the Olympic rings on it somewhere and have done with it. Consider for example, that the iconic lions golden syrup tin, what could be better than a picture of a lion being attacked by a swarm of Africanized killer bees? Go and look at your lions golden syrup 10 if you don't know what I'm talking about, and I think that would make a superb logo. This is called up in the mountains Dobson and marigold crew were up in the mountains. Dobson was wearing an ill advised cravat, while marigold chews sported a leopard skin pillbox hat. They were in pursuit of a murderer reported to have taken refuge in the mountains. Their purpose was to persuade the murderer to repent his killing spree. They had no interest in bundling him back down from the mountains to face earthly justice. They simply wanted him to repent. The murderer was babinski heavy of mustache and lumbering of gait. He had proud the streets of pointy town in darkness before I botched slaying panicked him and he took to the mountains. The mountains were teeming with bears. Many, many many of the bears were afflicted with lupus, a particular form of earth sign lupus common in that mountainous region. You might think that lupine animals like wolves would be more prone to lupus than Earth sign animals like bears. But as I just pointed out, if you were listening, this was a strain of earth sign lupus, not lupine lupus. There were few wolves in the mountains, but they were for the most part tremendously, hail and healthy wolves. lupus, neither earth sign nor lupine. But human is an unaccountably popular disease in the television medical drama house MD. intriguingly Dobson and marigold two had arranged their trip to the mountains by buying tickets from a travel agency named foreman Cameron and chase. These are the names of Dr. Houses young assistants. In a further twist, so improbable that it could almost be fictional. The conductor on the train that brought them to the station at the mountain foothills with a man called cardi Wilson, cardi and Wilson are as it happens, the other two main characters in house MD. And not only that, but with his huge lagoo breus mustache and lumbering gait. The train conductors resemblance to the killer babinski was startling. There had been an unfortunate incident on the train in the dining car. When a gung ho Dobson had removed his ill advised cravat and tried to shove it into the conductor's mouth to incapacitate him and to place him under arrest, thinking he was babinski. This was despite the warning words of marigold to alert to one or two subtle features of Cuddy Wilson's physiognomy, which differed from that of the fugitive maniac. Dobson was lucky not to be thrown off the train, for it so happened that the train conductor was an adept of goon Fang, and he had no trouble at all disarming Dobson of the ill advised cravat and crumpling him into the helpless posture known as Pon gak Hoon, in which he spent the remainder of the journey. Thus, upon arrival at the mountain foothills, the pamphleteer was unable to think straight, because he had missed his breakfast, and valuable hours were lost as he insisted on stopping at a snack bar, where he stuffed himself with bloaters and Special K and sausages. Let us treat

ourselves to a bird's eye view of the terrific mountains. If we imagine were hovering directly above them hundreds of feet in the air at Cloud level, perhaps, we can draw a triangle between three points. Call them a B and C. At a we have the snack bar in the foothills wherein we find Dobson and marigold to add b we have an encampment of mountain bears, many stricken with a sign lupus and that C The killer babinski taking shelter in a declivity that might be a crevasse high in the mountains, examining the contents of his knapsack packed in a panic as he made his getaway from pointy town. Had babinski red Dobson's uncharacteristically useful pamphlet, never pack a knapsack in a panic out of print, he would not have been in the pickle in which he now found himself. Dobson did not write the pamphlet specifically to advise homicidal fugitives from earthly justice who had fled into the mountains, and the majority of tips in its 20 pages have a more general application. Indeed, one of the few positive reviews the pamphleteer ever received in his lifetime came from a noticing big sturdy boots, the Journal of the budget spinny hiking club, whose anonymous critic praised the pamphlet for its, quote, judicious good sense and greaseproof paper rapping, unquote. The writers only caveat was Dobson's exclusive use of the word knapsack, which was felt could cause offence to those who prefer the terms have a second rucksack. Younger listeners should know that in those days, the barbaric backpack had not yet solid to the language. So they're at point C, the disconsolate babinski rummaged among the items he had packed panic stricken into his knapsack. Instead of useful things like a compass and pemmican and string. He found that he had a paperback Gazetteer of bassoon clot Shire a tattered pin cushion innocent of pins, from which half the stuffing had fallen out. A photograph of a pig, to corks, and unpaid gas bill, a badge from Richard Milhouse Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign when he ran against Hubert Humphrey, several small and purposeless cloth pads, a rusty whisk, a paper bag full of bent or otherwise damaged fountain pen nibs, the packaging from a black pudding here they can just before he killed the toothless vagrant of pointy town, hair dye, a plasticine Starling much dust a cardboard tag or tab or label on which some unknown functionary had scribbled the word pointless. a beaker caked with mold another beaker with a gash in its base, a sleeveless and walked 12 inch picture disc of Vienna. It means nothing to me by Ultravox whittles twigs scrunched up dead cloth, the node bones of a weasel or possibly a squirrel feathers, a pictorial guide to cephalopods, someone else's illegible addressbook an empty carton of no egg, more dust, more feathers, more bones and a syringe containing a goodly amount of earth sign lupus antidote. Having meekly laid out all this rubbish on a ledger in the declivity, or crevasse where he squatted bubinski stuffed it all back into his knapsack made the knapsack a pillow, lay splayed out on his back, and fell asleep. Meanwhile,

over at point b on our triangle, there many many many bears both those with earth sign lupus and those without what also fast asleep and had been for some hours. It was as if they had been engulfed by some sort of narcoleptic gas. But those with knowledge of the mountains and of the mountain bears would tell you that there was nothing to worry about. It was simply a case of an encampment of sleeping bears high in the mountains, who would eventually Wake Up. Down in the foothills, village folk might tell stories about the mysterious experiments going on in the pneumatic institution for inhalation gas therapy, but they knew not aware of they spoke for they were peasants, rather than scientists. And that's their expertise was in such matters as slurry and pig swill and barnyard maintenance rather than an exciting gas activity. In any case, by skipping along to point a one could find Dobson and marigold true in the snack bar wide awake and intently planning their next steps in tracking down the killer babinski and making him repent. Ever resourceful marigold true had brought her oXby steering panel to facilitate the search. neither she nor Dobson could be said to be natural mountain is both of them more at home on the flat surfaces, such as ice rinks and tidal plains. Yet they have a sense of overwhelming duty to make the killer repent, preferably on his knees, or sprawled on the ground in a posture of abject groveling lat are like Pon gak Hoon, from which Dobson was only just recovering with the help of the tremendous snack bar breakfast menu. So enthusiastically was he stuffing his gob that marigold chew began to wonder if her parable would be too bloated, to clamber in sprightly fashion up into the mountains before nightfall. She was well aware, even if Dobson was not that at nighttime, these mountains were both eerie and perilous for all those years ago. She had paid attention in the prefabricated schoolroom when Miss Huda brass taught the important key stage four spritely clambering in mountains at night learning module. And it will be night star splattered and Moonstruck before the three corners of our triangle, each set in motion and begin ever so slowly, but implacably to converge upon each other. The triangle twisting, warping like babinski Ultravox record shrinking, Dobson and marigold to the killer babinski and many, many, many bears, including those stricken with a sign lupus will meet in the most desolate hour of the night up in the mountains as a spot we can call point D. and here at point D, as if awaiting them bashed firmly into the hard compacted snow stands an upright cylinder of reinforced plexiglass sealed with a rubber cork. It is one of a number of cylinders placed here and there in the mountains by boffins from the pneumatic institution for inhalation gas therapy. And as the peasants down in the foothills could tell you as like pausing their doings with slavery and pigs will and barnyard maintenance. Only the devil knows what some of those boffins are up to. And as I can tell you, even though I am no devil, there were rogue elements among the boffins bad boffins and one such boffin had just yesterday, filled the cylinder at point D with a new and terrible and loathsome gas, which when uncorked would fail, all living things within a 20 yard radius crumble them as if they had been placed in the palm gak Hoon posture, beloved of goon Fang adepts, like the babinski double train conductor, and their brains would be modified in gruesome and unseemly ways. And then, as the gas dispersed into the clear mountain air, as dawn broke, each of them would awaken Dobson and marigold to the killer babinski and many, many, many bears, including those stricken with a sign lupus, and each of them the world would seem raw, different, alive with new Tangs and hues and vapors. And the three points of the triangle would slowly move apart relentlessly forever, as if they had never ever converged.

as regular listeners to hooting out on the air No. The show consist entirely of reportage none of this is made up or fictional in any way. And as a way of clarifying that for you. There was a there's a new biography of Peter Mark Roget, the, the man who compiled Roget's thesaurus, a new biography of him by Nick Reynolds, Renison and Steven Poole reviewed it in the papers at the weekend and he wrote among among the other things that is noted in his biography is this Roget studied medicine at Emory University and began work at the wonderfully named pneumatic institution for inhalation gas therapy, where he probably knew Coleridge, who loved to suck on the nitric oxide. Yes, so that's the pneumatic institution for inhalation gas therapy somewhere in the mountains. Talking of Coleridge, I may have mentioned this before, but it's an anecdote I very much like from Table Talk by Samuel Rogers, where he wrote code or it was a marvelous talker, Wordsworth and I called upon him one for noon when he was in a lodging of power now, he talked uninterruptedly for about two hours, during which Wordsworth listens to him with profound attention. Every now and then, nodding his head as if in a cent. On quitting the lodging I said two words with well for my own path, I could not make head or tail of Coleridge eration pray, did you understand it? Words with replied, not one syllable of it. I think it must have been fun to listen to Calgary talking uninterruptedly for two hours. onwards, in punga, you can recognize the sap traps because they were plumed hats, or so I'm told in guma. By contrast, perhaps of the sap traps are unplumbed and look like any other hats supported by a million other humans. The satraps can be distinguished by their tattoos, pumpkin satraps as true tattooing, which is reserved for their shaman, but there are no shaman in guba. If one flies over the mountains into Gar, one finds that the satraps wear plumed hats and sports tattoos, and that the truth method of adverting to their satrap them is their habit of always carrying a bundle of tally sticks. The shaman of Gar have both plumed hats and tattoos, but they do not carry tally sticks. They tie their hair in complex stylized knots. This much I have learned and then grateful to have learned from a fascinating periodical entitled satraps and shaman of panga and guma, and Gar. It is published on the first Thursday of each month, and it's packed with articles and photographs and quizzes and competitions. Since I picked up a copy of the newsagents in an Esplanade on a mezzanine level as an airport a short while ago, it has become my absolute favorite periodical ever. Even though I have no previous interest in either satraps, or shaman, whether they were from panga or guma, or Gar or any other country you care to mention, I have been won over by the magazine's exit. In all particulars, but mostly by its vividness. It is the most vivid of periodicals more vivid even then the Reader's Digest. In punga the satraps hold councils that which are discussed important to meteorological issues. The Tongan shaman consider the weather to fall within the purview, and this can lead to clashes between satraps and shaman. Such clashes are conducted at a strictly verbal level, and give rise to some fascinating linguistic quirks. Because there are no shaman in guma the guman satraps have the weather alter themselves and face no clashes. In Gar, the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots. I have said that Gar is on the other side of the mountains from panga and guma. But I have yet to learn what these mountains are called, or indeed where they are. vivid as the periodical is, I have to say that it's forthcoming on matters geographical. And that's an understatement. I've been toying with the idea of writing a letter to the editor suggesting that a future issue might include some maps. When I was a little chap, I had a passion for maps, just like the narrator of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I'm no longer a little chap at all. But I'd like to see maps,

colorful ones of panga and goober and Gar, they would make the periodical even more vivid than it already is. In poker, the satraps have dominion over the birds of the air, or at least they act as if they do. They devise many laws to which the birds of the air are subject. flightless birds fall within the remit of the shaman of panga. They do not create laws, but they consider flightless birds to be sacred and count them often. The sack perhaps count the birds of the air also with different purposes in mind. In guma, all known birds are poultry. In Gar, the satraps carry tally sticks, and the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots. I stumbled upon my first copy of the periodical in that newsagent in an Esplanade on a mezzanine level at an airport quite by accident. I was due to board a flight to a remote Prison Island, where I had been asked to sluis out the convicts brains with an exciting and dangerous new fluid. I had a few minutes to spare before my flight and went to pick up the latest Reader's Digest repair work was being done to the newsagents frontage, so I had to squeeze in through a side panel that's entering a part of the shop I would normally not have explored. Most of the racks here was stacked with fruit pastels and pastry snacks. And I have no need of these things. For when traveling. I always take my own food a single copy of the September issue of satraps and shaman of panga and guma and Gar layer top a tinderbox on the floor next to a display of packets of jammy teardrops. I picked it up out of curiosity, and was struck by its vividness in panga the satraps have a counting system of astonishing complexity. It is possible that their brains are wired in a way unique to them. The shaman counters you I would count although as you would expect, they use different words for numbers. The satraps do not even use words when they count, nor do the satraps in goombah but that is because they do not count at all. The guman the satraps pipe and hum in place of counting, they manufacture spikes and nails and do a lot of purposeless hammering. In Gar for satraps carry tally sticks. The publishers do not make a binder available in which to keep copies of their vivid periodical. And this is another matter I plan to raise in my letter to the editor recommending the inclusion of colorful maps. I'm extremely keen on binders for periodicals, whether or not they are vivid. It is true that I have quite a number of loose unbound periodicals in my collection. And that pains me I numb the pain with prayer for that is what the Bishop of Suffolk told me to do. When some of the more promising convicts had had their brain slowest with my exciting and dangerous new fluid. I sent them a project to make binders for my unbound periodicals including satraps and shaman of panga and goober and Gar. They made an excellent Fist of it with limited resources. And I like to think that the brain sluicing had much to do with that In panga the satraps make regular changes to the plumes in their hats according to the phases of the moon, the shaman take no notice of the moon for veio fealty to the sun in guma the satraps believe that the health of their poultry is dependent upon the stars. In Gar, the satraps carries tally sticks, and the shaman tie their hair in complex stylized knots. I have counted all my binders, and I'm carrying a tally stick. And later today, after I have watched the news bulletins and weather forecast on television, and had a little chat with the Bishop of Suffolk, I'm going to tie my hair in complex stylized knots. Bye bye
