Gosh I'm feeling intense and tonic. My name is Frankie. This is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. I banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of my troubles. The font was hewn from adamantine rock and the water it contained so of necessity holy water was icy. When the priest slopped it onto my bashed head, I screamed at such a pitch. The stained glass window depicting the martyrdom of sin biblically bib, spikes tongs fire, which shattered a falling sharp slice the priest juggler, and it collapsed but not before dropping me into the font. While I splashed about balling and freezing, minuscule organisms with which the water was riddled swam into my ears and borrowed tiny tunnels into my brain. Were in they lay their eggs. It's the organisms will miniscule. Imagine how microscopically we were their eggs. before death claimed me. I was plucked from the font by the Sexton, whose beard was so vast and hairy. I was almost suffocated as he crushed me to him. gurgling I was passed to my mother, a woman of great dustiness, who endangered my life many a time in the following month, usually by taking me to unsuitable picnics, and suitable in that they took place in snow storms or during beaumier weather on steep hillsides down which I would roll gathering pace as I approached the bottom, a railway line or major arterial thoroughfare along which huge container lorries thundered. Fortunately, though perplexingly the Sexton was always on hand to rescue me in the nick of time. Miraculously, I survived into toddlerhood. Around this time, my mother began to encourage me to play on the roof of our hotel during electrical storms. I was grateful for the rubber booties and led the lion swaddling jacket the Sexton gave me more than one side toppled from the roof into the moat, and I soon learned to swim skillfully to dodge both the sharp fangs scavenge of fish and the unexploded mines they're in. Regular swimming while wearing Raymond to lead does wonders to build up one's muscular strength. And sure enough, by my sixth birthday, my mother was exhibiting me circuses and freak shows. I was known as Little dagobert, the strongest boy in the universe. Sometimes I came close to being flattened by the steam rollers I pulled across lawns and village greens, until the Sexton gave me a handy tip to avoid even the gentlest of downhill inclines. Being of an implausibly rare blood group, I had to be extra careful in the vicinity of sharp knives, axes and slices. My caution served me well when, on my 10th birthday, my mother had me apprenticed to a well known butcher. He was a florid, chubby, deranged and blood drenched man, who took both pride and pleasure in his inhumane slaughtering methods. I was inconsolable for days after he slew the Sexton and chopped him to bits and made him into illegal pie fillings. I resolved to run away to see though we lived far, far from any coast. One crisp autumns dawn, I gathered my few pitiable belongings and tied them in a bundle and tied the bundle to the end of a stick, and with the stick propped jauntily over my shoulder, I set out to make my white in the world. Before I got so far as the garden gate however, the microscopic eggs in my brain all hatched at once, unless Fourth monsters that I had passed through much travail in my short life. Things were about to get much, much worse.

That was called Little dagobert. And it's the opening story in the new anthology by aerostat to hooting yard, a frank key reader, which is an E book available from the dabbler editions. And it's got 147 stories in it. I wrote a lengthy and erudite introduction by Roland Claire. a bargain at something like four or five pounds, I think it's designed for the Kindle, but apparently you can read Kindle ebooks on pretty much any contraption you might have. So I recommend that you buy that go to the hooting yard website. And you'll see a picture over to the right or left over to the right of the screen, a picture of the cover which lovely covered by Ruthie Bosh with a picture of a bird. And if you click on the cover, then it takes you to a place where you can find a link to where you can go buy the book. So I E book, The E book, not a book, as I recommend that you do that. One Piece you won't find in it is the thing I'm about to read now and the reason it's not in it is because I only wrote it last Friday. Yesterday I put all my eggs in one basket and counted my chickens before they hatch. These deeds put me in bad odor with the eggs and chickens man who, when it came on his rounds in the afternoon reprimanded me. He told me in no uncertain terms that I was foolhardy. I am sorry to varrick I said, For I lived in the Soviet Union, at least within my head. I felt strangely compelled to do both those things. I said, I don't know what came over me. He looked at me closely the expression on his face and admixture of reproach, contempt, pity, disgust, superiority, compassion, bewilderment, nausea, manners, loving or rancor, spleen, pomposity, sympathy, empathy, and psychopathology. I did not like the way he was absent mindedly swinging to and fro, a huge, gleaming razor sharp Butcher's cleaver. Perhaps he said, eventually, you are a fool. Like those holy fools with whom Your beloved Mother Russia used to swarm? Oh, no, I said, You've got the wrong Russia. I think you'll find that holy fools were rife in the vast Russian countryside under the Tsar. My own preferences, my own preferences for the Soviet Union, from which such fools were eradicated. Be that as it may, said, the eggs and chickens man, this is neither Czarist Russia nor the Soviet Union and your behavior was that of a fool, foolish and foolhardy. I hate to be reminded that I do not actually live in the Soviet Union. I could feel hot tears welling up. Why don't you pop inside? I said, there's a piping hot samovar full of black tea far too much for me to drink all by myself. He gave the cleaver another more measured swing, and I felt a sickening spasm in the bowels. I think not. He said. I have my rounds to do. I'll be back tomorrow. And by then I'll want to see that you've redistributed the eggs into several baskets and uncounted the chickens uncounted I said, How can I uncounted chickens to vorige. Stop calling me to Varric he said, You are perfectly able to button the buttons on your trip surge jacket and then to unbutton them. The principle is the same As he walked off along the line drawn Tilly swinging the butcher's cleaver, it occurred to me that I could use what just happened as material for my work in progress, a novel written strictly according to the precepts of socialist realism, I went indoors, poured a cup of black tea from the samovar and sat down at my escrow two or three hours later, I was still sat there, staring into space, my pen and touched the paper blank, the black tea stone cold

Because that will help all of us to continue doing what we do and you to continue listening to what we do. So please do that. You might like to mention hooting yard but send 10 pounds and everyone will be happy. Thank you very much. I love you lol up he she or it lollipops. We lol up you will not lol up vile up. This is the famous opening paragraph of Dobson's unfinished unpublished novel, the lepers. It was one of his very few attempts at fiction, a register for which he was completely unsuited, as he recognized in his magisterial pamphlet, and magisterial exegesis of my resounding failure as a novelist, with a surfeit of adjectives, and a ham fisted watercolor plate of Ida lupino. out of print. In the pamphlet, Dobson wrote, what I wanted to do in the law lepers was to drill down down and down as deeply as anybody could drill into the very core of lolloping. I thought that if anybody was qualified for the task, it was me for when I am not trudging or plotting or gathering or saturating or stalking I lol up. I have a lot of uptime on Canal towpath seaside promenade, important Metropolitan Boulevard, rustic lanes, and many another home to the pedestrian. I have love up to in all four seasons of the year in light and dark in blistering heat and bitter cold. Indeed, in my preliminary sketches for the novel, I planned an entire chapter in which my fictional hero dapsone, a hugely successful pamphleteer, beloved by millions and the cynosure of millions more, it seemed lolloping during a cold snap.

Frank Key  13:54
A secondary aim was to really queue my way through the connecting wire if there is one between lolloping and lopping. In the domain of trees for example, lopping is an intrinsic part of palardy you cannot pull out say, a willow, such as the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing in brief encounter, David lien 1945. Without doing a bit of lopping, you might use a woodsman's axe or a sword of some description. But whatever cutting tool you avail yourself of a lot, you will. The question is between the ramshackle shed from where you collect the axe or sore and the willow you are set to Pollard and thus lob? Is it imperative that you must love up? Could you in the throes of hysteria, skip or even sprint? And if you did not lock up, how would this affect the quality of your loping and therefore we'd piercingly acute logic, your palardy actually that appears to be three questions not one, so the careful reader will spot perhaps before I did that I'm becoming hopelessly entangled in the thickets of my own creative struggle. I'm no longer even clear whether I'm writing in the appropriate grammatical tense. when one considers that lopping might also apply to the lopping off of limbs and Gosh, hole heads by the armed and armored henchmen of a particularly vindictive medieval Baron, is it any surprise that my novel Giada to a hold of that magisterial opening paragraph, it is not. Later in the pamphlet, Dobson confesses that he shoved the manuscript of the loppers into a drawer where light of that year around the time of Harold Wilson's resignation as prime minister, it was eaten by voracious famished beetles.

Before the next piece, a date for your diary on Saturday, the eighth of February if the ice of February is a Saturday at the bfsi on the South Bank, there's a program of selection of animated films as part of the British animation awards 2014. And one of the films that the early evening showing I think it's six o'clock 630, something like that. One of the films in the selection, on the eighth of February is a recipe for gruul which is a, an animated short made by Sharon Smith. Based on my story, a recipe for grew, which are not interwrite as part of the film is the London premiere of well, the greatest film ever made, basically, hopefully is lined up for, you know, all the Oscars that it could possibly win. And we other awards might even win a British animation award award. So a recipe for Girl by Sharon Smith, an animation based on a recipe for growth. The story by me is the bfsi on the South Bank, on the eighth of February, be there or not. There's a story I remember from my childhood called the brass neck goose. Or rather, I remember the title but not much of the story itself. As far as I recall it involved in goose that was ordinary in all particulars, except that its neck was made of brass. When except such improbabilities child, as indeed one continues to accept them when grown if the spinner of improbable tales is a skilled one. If for instance, a Latin American magical realist with a clutch of literary awards under his or her belt, introduces into a fat novel a goose with a neck of brass, we might have a moment where we say perish or pure. We might even cut the book across the room into the fireplace, but more likely given the laurels with which the writer is garlanded, we will accept the goose and read on dazzled by the author's inventiveness. On the other hand, if we're reading a book by some lesser known writer, and one say, whose infelicities of style and boneheaded stupidity have already tempted us to trap a book into the fireplace. And then, as we're growing increasingly exasperated, a goose with a brass neck is introduced for no compelling reason on page 114. Then, push or push Sure, again to be the mildest explosives with which we will erupt. A company no doubt by curses unsuitable for delicate is we will also be likely not only to give into the temptation and to truck the book into the fireplace, after all, But to ensure that the roaring fire is blazing there in the better to obliterate this Farago of printed nonsense from our memories. But as children we don't we do not care to pins for the literary reputation of the writer, and we're immune to infelicities of style, and even to boneheaded stupidity. As children were caught up in the story, however improbable, however ill written. For one thing we're probably not reading but being read to by Mama. As we like tucked snogging bed. our bellies warm with milk, our eyes fixed on the paper stars glued to the bedroom ceiling. When we are told that Ipsy Dipsy limping along the lane meets a goose with a brass neck. We simply accept that this is the kind of thing that happens to Ipsy Dipsy and might even happen to us. If ever we find ourselves walking along a country line. Unlikely as that may be given a we live in a hideous urban sprawl with bailius sprig of greenery to be seen. I said I could not recall the story But see, see I've remembered it but he didn't see and the lane. little details rear reappear in my mind's eye.

I remember it's the Dipsy, pointy Red Hat, and the calipers on his legs. For Ipsy. Dipsy was a cripple, at least at the beginning of the story. I remember the line. It was lying like the avenue at middle harness painted by Obama was deputy deputy or Flemish. Was he still wearing the calipers at the stories end? Or have you been able to cast them aside and just throw them happily into a deck on account of some magical cure affected by the goose? The goose is magic powers in here in his brass neck as quickly as the memories come shimmering, like the paper stars on the ceiling long ago, so equally quickly, they fade like the stars will fade in the heavens. The night sky will be black and vast and pitiless. And I will talk to her about fumbling in the darkness, aged and exhausted, knowing that there will be no brass neck goose to save me from extinction.

So, Pete Seeger died earlier in the week 1919 to 2014. I remember reading an article once that attacked PC, on account of the fact that he retained the legal copyright to the lion sleeps tonight. Even though he knew the penniless, penniless persons foreigner from whom he had stolen it. Who didn't get any of the money? For anyway, I don't know if that's true or not. Who would want to cast aspersions upon the dead? Anyway, just thought I'd mention it. Pete Seeger anyway, he died and he was 95. And excuse me, in one of his songs. Pete Seeger sang about what he do if he had a hammer. Well, I had a hammer. I hammered in the morning. I hammered in the evening all over this land. I hammered out danger. I hammered out a warning. I hammered out love between my brothers and sisters all over this land. Like should have seen that coming. As I said, before I hammered the love out of them. I hammered out a warning. It was hardly my fault if I thought I was just remarking about. Personally, if I think one of my siblings roaring towards me at dusk, armed with a hammer, I'd have made a run for it. Particularly when it was clear. I'd been hammering things all day, all over this land. Anyway, I had a good night's sleep and the next day I continued hammering. There was not much left to hammer in this land. So I crossed the border. I hammered the Some the border guard. And then I had a happy day hammering everything that lay in my path in this new country. Bang, bang, bang. That was me with the occasional doll thump if I hammered something soft and squishy. I didn't discriminate. If I saw it, I hammered it. It really was as simple as that. But then I was fortunate to have such a good hammer. When my hammering was still in the planning stages, it was suggested to me that I should obtain a silver hammer from Maxwell's. For sure, I said, I actually said for sure, like a character in a bad play from the interwar years. But I was right to do so. Maxwell's silver hammer was fashionable enough and it's time. But the kind of hammering I intended to do required something sturdier a real Thumper. So I've got my hammer from Huberman that gorgeous department store. I was so pleased with it, that I hammered my way out of the shop, and didn't stop hammering until I got home. It was the following day that I started to hammer all over this land. Then the day after that, I hammered my way halfway across the neighboring land. It was much bigger and much more densely packed with people and things. So I had a lot more hammering to do that in my own land. But eventually, I got to the frontier, having hammered pretty much everything in sight. As I nestled down for the night in a border chalet, I inspected my hammer, I was pleased to see that it was almost as good as new. There were a couple of scuff marks, and quite a lot of blood. But otherwise it looked as if it would serve me well, for as long as I continued hammering all over as many lands as I descended upon, like an angel of death with my hammer.

And I think we've got just time for one last tale this week. I better read it fairly quickly, but it's very short. One La la la morning, tiny Enid was limping along the cliffs at the edge of the big frightening sea when across the sky. Zooming directly at her came a gigantic, colorful but winged flying insect of unknown provenance. Most infants would have screeched in Kara and cried for ma or part of rescue them. But of course, the plucky fascist taught was not most infants. She raised her arms as if in terror to pull the wool over the huge airborne beings eyes. If it actually had any, and screech she did. But it was a screech, not a fright, but a blood curdling menace. It was so terrific of screech that the enormous brightly colored moth ish type being was immediately deafened, playing havoc with it complicated navigational head integuments and it plummeted forthwith into the broiling waters were unable to swim. It's drowned. Tiny he made landfall her arms and patted the pocket where he carried her tiny toy mannlicher carcano snipers rifle, which, in spite of being tiny, and a toy was a devastatingly effective firearm. I'm glad I did not have to use my trusty snipers rifle to slaughter that curious wing flapping monster, she thought, for it remained fully loaded, and I can put the bullets to better use. Should I happen later this morning to come upon malefactors and ne'er do wells roaming the cliffs as indeed she did. But that is another story for another more gruesome time. That's the end of this week's show. I may not be here next week, so you may hear a repeat. But that won't stop you sending your tenor to resonance and buying the E book from the dabbler. Bye bye
