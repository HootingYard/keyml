Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. We've got a lot to get through this week. So I'm going to crack right on with the first in a series of tugboat tales. And as you might expect, this is called tugboat tales. Number one. I once read a story I can't remember where about a dyspeptic tugboat captain who wore sinister black gloves, and struck fear into his crew. I remember that his name was Captain Bagshaw or showbag and that his tugboat was ancient and Rusty and rotten. I think I read the story in a newspaper, which would suggest that it was factual rather than some made up fiction, but I can't be sure. The captain's black gloves were made of wool, and often became tattered and frayed. And I recall a phrase in the story where we were told that he used to dam them with malevolence. Now, I've done a lot of darling in my time for I'm handy with a needle and thread and crochet and knitting needles and such like, I have done socks and jumpers and balaclavas and mittens, though not admittedly gloves. Yet I cannot for the life of me think how I might done something malevolently, though God knows I tried to in the weeks and months after reading the story of Captain Bagshaw or showbag in that newspaper, if it wasn't newspaper, it may have been a periodical. I tried snarling or spitting at passing puppy dogs as I damned, but it came across as churlish and bad tempered rather than malevolent, and I felt like a fool. When the captain snarled, he made a sound like the coining of 1000 crows, and when he spat he spat sulfur. There were no puppies on the tugboat, of course, but there was a badger. The captain did not snarl at it, because it was his creature is familiar. At one point, I think it's described as a demonic badger, whatever that may be. I think we were meant to see the captain as a kind of Ahab figure obsessed and mad, as well as sinister. But for me, this effect was floored by the fact that it was a rented tugboat bagshawe shore bag did not own it. Every week, he had to slip some coinage into the waiting palm of a seaside bureaucrat representative of a doll organizations stuffed with accountants and administrators. Their main business seemed to be civic coastline management and prettifying with renting out a tugboat to a sinister big gloved madman as an afterthought. Somehow that made him less than master of his vessel for me, and I remember touching ruefully as I read the paragraph in which this was explained. whoever wrote the story clearly felt it was important, for it was a very long paragraph leaden with detail, and I skipped past it on my subsequent rereading. So there was Captain Bagshaw or showbag on his rented tugboat with his demonic badger and a terror stricken crew. And then there was the radio cabin, a tiny cubby hole squeezed under the all up deck. I'm no expert on maritime who ha, but I suspect it's unusual for a tugboat to have an all up deck, let alone a radio cabin. No illustrations accompany the story and the writer is vague on details about the tugboats specifications. I have to say that this did not bother me when I read it. And it was only years later when I talked about the tugboat with a rattled and Brian soaked old sea dog while on holiday at Oh, hula Holmes Wharf that I learned of these anomalies. I put them out of mind However, I'm sure there are all sorts of different designs of tugboat flying the harbors of the world, big ones and tiny ones, rotting ones and gleaming ones. Ones that fly flags and ones that don't and ones with and without all up decks and radio cabins. It's only just occurred to me that we're never told the name of the tugboat.

The captain's handwriting was spidery but surprisingly legible given that he never removed his sinister black woolen gloves, even when wielding his fashionable fat fountain. pen. It was a sturdy pen, and it needed to be because one of the captains enigmatic little ways was that he mixed it ink with glue. He used the pen to keep his log, of course, but was also given to scrawling commands and directives and warnings and decrees on sheets of foolscap and pasting them up all over the tugboat. One such sign was on the door of the radio cabin, forbidding any of the crew to enter in any circumstances at any time ever. The punishment for doing so was not made explicit, but it did not need to be. For as we have seen, Captain Bagshaw stroke showbag kept the tugboat in a permanent state of stomach churning terror as a youth, if one could imagine him as a youth. He had studied the methods of tyrants and dictators and megalomaniacs from Joseph Stalin to Paul Bano Heusen, and once he stepped aboard his tugboat, even though it was rented, his self belief carried him through. As I have indicated, I may not be convinced of his power, but the crew certainly were. Except that is for the latest recruit a plug ugly, loose limb Blanton jawed feather hatted, scented and perfumed dimity deckhand who cut his teeth in the Puffin club. I think the writer guy gives his name, but I can't remember it. Let's pluck a name out of the ether and call him say, Siegfried Sassoon for the sake of convenience. No, let's not. Let's call him Puffin boy. Now, Puffin boy, in addition to being plugged ugly and loose limbed and lanten, Jordan feather hatted and scented and perfumed and dimity was functionally illiterate. He could just about managed simple three letter words like orb and lip and jog, but anything more complicated was beyond him, and bagshawe showbag like to write his brutish decrees in long winded flowery sentences so as not to waste even a speck of his full SCAP. That's it was that Puffin boy blundered into the radio cabin quite unaware that it was off limits to such as he. Although most of the captain's commands were senseless and deranged, he had good reason to keep his crew away from the radio. He wanted to ensure that no one twiddle the dial away from important seafaring information channels and tuned into a program very popular at that time, called tugboat crew playtime. This was a music show, which was bound to distract tugboat crews from their tugboat duties. For It featured a roster of presenters with mellifluous voices, who played tunes requested by tugboat crew members from near and far. A typical show would include works by glazunov borodin vai, burn kind heart, Hines car, Gruber Sebelius, Petula Clark, Conway Twitty, Alexander Scriabin, the Memphis drug band, our boli. oumou Sangare sleater Kinney Sylvester a river well tests Big Bill broonzy Bucks Fizz Augustus Pablo Bela Bartok, Cliff Richard and the shadows. Morton Feldman, Charles Ives, big audio dynamite George Formby, Mercedes Sosa Jacques Brel, Schubert Schumann, Monte Verde, Ned Rorem, Quicksilver messenger service, Cassie Uber, Cab Calloway, the Psychedelic Furs, OMara, portuondo Burning Spear, Peter Warlock, Carl Ruggles, the strawberry alarm clock. Joan Baez have a gal Brian Dennis brain, Cheech and Chong Neutral Milk hotel, and the carpenters. Not only did Puffin boy retune the radio to tugboat crew playtime, but he managed to jam both the tuner dial and the volume knob. This was not done by design for Puffin boy was an innocent dunda paid up on the all up deck

Captain Bagshot shore bag was stalking around with his demonic badger in tow when his eardrums were assailed by Yana tracks glycolytic mass blaring from down below. As expected, he flew into a rage. What was unexpected was that he did so literally, his feet left the deck he flapped his arms and he found himself soaring 40 feet above his rented tugboat. a gust of wind took him then, and he was carried off over the glistening sea into the blue. Months later, an intrepid ornithologist was clambering around on a rock He outcrop, buffeted by wind and waves. peering through his blockman scope. He observed a sea bird's nest, orcs or skewers, I can't recall. And there was the captain in his sinister black gloves, scribbling on a sheet of foolscap with his fashionable fat fountain pen, and the birds were gathered around him screeching madly and trembling with terror. I wish I could tell you what became of the tugboat and its crew, particularly Puffin boy, but the writer confesses he does not know. Perhaps one day, I will remember where I read the story and track it down and track down a copy and find out whether it's truth or fiction and tell it to you properly.

I don't know if there are any plans for tugboat crew playtime to be broadcast on resonance FM but if it happens, I'll let I'll be the first to let you know. Now. Excuse me, apparently, crouch is a big I'm gonna start again, because I put in a put in a an indefinite article there when I shouldn't have done. Apparently, crouch is big threat says caca. At least that's what it said in big black letters on a staple bundle of paper I noticed while sitting on a bus yesterday. There was smaller lettering underneath lots of it. Also black on a white background, but I was too far away to be able to read it. Having digested CAC as view of the threat from crouch, I turned my head to look out of the window at the passing scene. There were all sorts of words to read outside in all different colors. tasty snacks in red on yellow, Kung wild loon red on white stop all in uppercase. black on white with a red trim and furniture wanted in gold on green. We're just some I saw among many, many others, but somehow I couldn't get the caca crowd dude are out of my head. Later, back at home, I pulled some boiled water into a cup and added an infusion of something I understood might dampen the fires in my brain pan. The infusion turned the water Brown, but had little effect on the spongy form gray blob inside my skull, which was still throbbing away. I assumed that caca had good reason to see crouch as a threat, indeed a big threat, and wondered if I too, should feel imperiled? And if so, what precautions I should take. The problem was that I did not understand the nature of the threat crouch posed, should I barricade myself inside my home? Or was it a case of getting some tablets from the chemist? If I did both, I might be overreacting and laying myself open to ridicule, not for the first time of course, but still. On the other hand, if I did neither, or if I failed to come up with any kind of defense against crouch, who knew what might become of me? It's at times of quandary like this that some people turn to God. But I have read my Dawkins and Dennett and Harris and Hitchens, and I wasn't going to fall for that one. incense in a kneeling posture wouldn't help me. If crouch came smashing into my life, wreaking whatever havoc crouch wreaked. caca would be more help to me, even God, I realized, could at least give me some handy tips on anti crouch techniques, but I have no idea how I might go about contacting caca. Despite its foul taste and ineffectual brain soothing properties. I got down another cup of tea infusion and pondered what to do next. My first idea was to go out onto the balcony and shout, caca, caca caca, like some kind of secular mu as in hoping that Cat Cat might be in the vicinity and would respond to my call. The chances of this was so remote that I swiftly dismissed it as the act of a pole. Kroon. I have read exhaustively on the subject of pole crooners over the years, and believe me, it was not a fellowship I wish to join. Wild Horses probably could drag me to a poltroon conclave, I do not think I'd be strong enough to resist their demented equine force. But Fingers crossed, there were no nearby horses of sufficient wildness to do the deed. Another idea occurred to me, which was that I could arm myself with a hammer and a hacksaw and stalk the streets in search of crouch. This too I dismissed partly because I was unsure if a hammer and a hacksaw would be weaponry enough to finish crouch off in one go. And partly because I didn't want to risk getting an asbo I've only just got my bus pass and library tickets back after a confiscation order. And that was a road I never wanted to go down again. dusk was falling. I spat into my tin spittoon and switched on the bed board bombardment box. On the screen, a glassy eyed noodle head was shrieking who is the biggest threat crouch or caca? You decide for crouch call? Oh 956739876254301 for caca call

Frank Key  16:42
Oh 956739876254302 my brainpan world in a miasma of chaos. What fragile morning I had in the here and now was snapped asunder. The hideous input of the noodle heads words was that caca was to was a threat. It was not as I thought that crouch spelled in Parliament and caca provided Sage counsel, it was a twin pronged attack. How cruelly I had been deceived by the staple bundle of paper on the bath. There was only one thing to do. I kick the knob on the box to silence the still shrieking, glassy eyed noodle head pulled on an item of casual knitwear and strode out towards the cluster of community hubs. Ah, but I carried on past them not looking back until I reached the Civic pond. And I sat there in the twilight on the damp grass and a more hand paddle towards me and fixed me with it's more hand stare. And I stared defiantly back. And the space between us fizzled with silent and invisible sparks. Until I was the more hand and the more hand was me.

Let's move on now to Oh, before I move on, I just wanted to someone pointed out to me that both of the pieces that I've just read and with people turning into birds, what that means, I don't know, but something you can think about. Let's move on to animals of the Frankish kings. in that corner of the ethereal realm where reside the Frankish kings, it was breakfast time. The kitchenette was overcrowded as usual, there was much jostling as the kings who each had very different breakfast needs struggled to find space to prepare and consume their morning repast. I was going to say that their breakfast needs differed in a very real sense, but of course that could not be so in the ethereal realm. Bacon sizzle that Charles the simple deployed his considerable skill IT skills while low Thea the second stood at his side, smashing many, many eggs into a big bowl. Both skeleton bowl had been bought it who Berman's the department store which is a byword for utter gorgeousness, though the bowl was plain and functional. Lo Thea The second was something of an egg fiend, or at least had been accused of being such by Pippin the short, the latter King may do with a handful of raisins for his breakfast, for he had decided to follow the same diet, which would work such wonders for Charles the fat. Charles the fat was no longer fat, and there had been some talk that he might adopt a new name, such as Charles the frankly skeletal, but it was decided that this would wreak confusion in the various published histories of the Frankish kings. He and Pippin the short, were rummaging in the rayson box, which was usually kept on the shelf by the suck and blow air circulation piping system hub, but this morning had somehow found its way into the pulses and lentils crate over by the window. Also by the window was odo, trumping on a cream cracker, as was his habit and peering through the greasy glass at the fields outside. One might have thought that these fields were the illicium ones, but alas, it was not so. They were just common fields, overgrown with Bracken and veteran furs, fields in which the Frankish kings disputed themselves on the weekday afternoons to get their recommended exercise. Far away across the fields stood the fabled and gorgeous who Berman's department store its frontage a glory of chrysanthemum packed hanging baskets. odo could not see it from where he was, of course, but his dreamy gaze prevented him from getting cantankerous at the antics of movie the pious and Louis the fourth trends Marina's who were fighting over the scotch pancakes. On some mornings, odo wanted to bang their heads together, even though he knew that the clang of their crowns colliding would wake Mui, the indolent, sprawled on the table taking a nap. While Charles the fat had addressed his fatness, and now gave the light his name. Louie the indolent, had become even more of an idol good for nothing than he had been during his earthly Frankish reign. Every now and then, the more mischievous kings such as Pippin the short and arnoff would poke at him with pointed sticks are no solution to the crowdedness of the kitchenette was done a electroair up high on the wall, and he was going to clamber up to it as soon as his porridge was boiled. This could take some time, as arnoff believed in over boiling his porridge for abstruse medical reasons he never condescending to articulate. It was because of him that the tiny kitchenette was fitted with no fewer than 16 fire extinguishers. These two came from who Berman's which center maintenance serve to test them once a month. Between the pulses and the lentils crate, and the iron spigot was at Crawley stacked with packets of cereal. Louie the stammer was crouched by it, trying to decide between Special K loopy fruit and weak loops or coco pops. He always ate his cereals dry without milk that he was lactose intolerant, and something about Madcap. Charles the simple saw him trying to make his mind up and prompted him to choose the coco pops, but only because he wanted to hear Louie the stammer trying to say coco pops.

Frank Key  23:50
Charles the simple was cruel, but in a childish way. He had been banned from who Berman's for playing stupid pranks at the revolving doors. When Louis the spammer ignored him and plumped for the loopy fruit and weak loops. Charles the sample pushed his way annoyingly towards the frankly filthy workshop and began chopping up a piece of raw liver. He had not yet grasped the concept of breakfast. And today after breakfast, it was time for the weekly car maintenance class. None of the Frankish kings could drive and of course, there were no cars in their corner of the ethereal realm, but it was still important, but they kept busy. Even Louie de indolent, was persuaded to join them in the activity tent, though he soon dozed off when the instructor started gathering on about crankshafts. Next week, Pip in the short and Louie the fourth trends marinas get lost while hiking. And after that piece appeared on the hooting yard website, which I'm sure you all know by now is at WWW dot hooting yd.org and I've got in the post what can only be described as a screed from Madame booboo, who describes herself as a mystic channeler. So I thought I'd read the letter out on the air. Dear Mr. Key, she wrote, I was in my kitchen boiling an enormous pan of rhubarb when I was other sudden in Gulf by wisps of Ecto plasm. And a voice spoke to me from the other side. Please note that this is the same place you described as the ethereal realm in your piece entitled, Annals of the Frankish kings, or at least I strongly suspect it is. Of course, there are many realms over many, many many, and we have cognisance of a mere handful. The vast majority of people are only familiar with the one realm this earthly one, but I am a mystic channeler and thus have access to more realms than I can shake a stick at the ethereal realm or other side being one of them. What happens is that the spirit beings who languish there sometimes find themselves impelled to send messages to those of us in this solid world of concrete and cement and soil and pebbles and clouds. It is no easy matter to breach the awful chasm that divides us, and that's where I come in. Even when I'm covering about engaged in workaday activities, such as boiling up an enormous pan of rhubarb, my channels remain open. I would explain further, but I suspect your puny brain would be incapable of grasping the Ehrenreich nature of my gift. As that wag HP Lovecraft put it the most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. I can vouch for that. Anyway, all this is by way of a preamble to the marrow of my message, which is that I have to pass on to you a complaint. As the Ecto plasm wafted around me, I became aware of a voice being channeled through the mystic ether. You may not be surprised to learn that it was the voice of Pippin, the short of whom you wrote in the aforementioned Annals of the Frankish kings. Here is what he said faithfully recorded using my pencil of the paranormal, which as luck would have it, I have sharpened under a zinc and copper pyramid just before putting the rhubarb on the boil. I have admitted the hideous guttural gurgling noises, which began this mystic communication, but otherwise give it for baiting. Oh, Madame booboo, you must pass on a complaint to a place called hooting yard. It must be known that I am not a Frankish King short of stature. Pippin the short is a mistranslation of pepper breath. I should rightly be known as Pippin or pepper for younger, for I have an older brother named Carlo man. That is always meant

Frank Key  28:29
age, not height. You cannot imagine how fed off I am of being thought a diminutive King, when in fact I am a king of average height. Please make sure this understanding is corrected to sweet or I may have to consider litigation which can get frightfully complex in this ethereal realm where I languish Enjoy your rhubarb. After what sounded like a choking sob, the voice grew silent and the Ecto plasm dispersed. I was about to stir my enormous pot of boiling rhubarb when another voice crashed in from the beyond. This time it was huri i'd siren of the silver screen Pola Negri who channeled a message of Titanic world importance through me. However, what she had to say is no concern of yours. I trust you will admit that you have produced the reputation of being a younger and rectify your error at once. Your sincerely madhhab boo boo van mystic.

Very quickly, there's just time to tell you about the fact that Mrs. gubbins is thrown a fit, dark cloud lewd and hailstones began to ping upon the pavement inside haemoglobin towers. Mrs gubbins an 83 year old colleague Daisy death, we're putting the finishing touches to their new software development pump action graphics hub 1.0 already being touted as a harbinger by techno build magazine. Would you care for a cup of tea dear? Ask Daisy noting that this is gubbins was panting as thematically and mopping her brow with a dainty handkerchief embroidered with a patent of crocus's, hollyhocks. mealy bugs and spurge. ack, gasped Mrs. gubbins. You're getting yourself all flustered. Mrs. gubbins said Daisy a little sharply, just because you forgot to insert a backslash into the command line for the ActiveX pod system trade default, reminded of this peccadillo This is gubbins became even more agitated, toppled offer ergonomic extruded plastic workstation seating module and landed on the floor threshing about in an alarming fashion, deary me matter Daisy to herself, and resolved at once to call an ambulance, despite the storm which was now raging outside, like something from the imagination of the painter john Martin. Meanwhile, a stream of grew was flowing from Mrs. gubbins thin lipped mouth, and her head was turning green. And at that moment of tension and suspense, I'm going to leave you because I don't know what happens next, I haven't been told yet. That was putting out on the air for this week, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
