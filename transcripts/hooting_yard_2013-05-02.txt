Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I forgot a couple of weeks ago that we celebrated the ninth anniversary of hooting yard. The first show was on the 14th of April 2004. So we're now in the in the run up to the exciting 10th Anniversary Show going forward. I got a letter this week from Kimiko. Ying. I'm not entirely sure who can Mika Ying is, but I think she lives in the United States. And she wrote to me, and said, Dear Mr. Key, I came across the following picture today, which struck me as remarkably familiar. And words from one of your earlier writings came to mind. Quote, each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle 14 votes to wear bucolic Hamlet. The the photograph to which Kimiko drew my attention is of a person wearing a pair of overalls, and a diving helmet and cycling along the beach. If you'd like to see the photo, go to hooting yard.org, the home of all things shooting yard on the World Wide Web. I'm sure you've been there before. And it's great photograph. And I had absolutely no memory of the piece that she was referring to. However, using the extremely state of the art, hooting yards search engine. I discovered that this was a story that had appeared on hooting yard, actually just before just before the radio show began. It appeared in March 2004. And this is the piece my diving helmet is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week on Friday afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle 14 votes to a bucolic Hamlet called mustard powervr. Curiously, there is no neighboring village named mustard Magna. Although a rustic barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of God in the local God pot drinking heart told me that they had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this toothless derelict said the sizeable cluster of wooden buildings known as mustard magma had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them driven insane by ergot poisoning, each bear capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling with a single flak from its mighty poor. Two hours after the first bear lumbered across sawdust bridge, the village of mustard magma was completely obliterated. It is still shown on some maps jamming my bicycle into a kiosk on mustered Parvati Yoko Ono Boulevard. I joined six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. huddled together in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot. We discuss our diving helmets, and take lamentably inaccurate minutes, which are published regularly through the good offices of the mustard parva thing whose editor is none other than the blind cousin of marigold, true source, the belle of Amherst and other essays written during an unprecedented p super by Dobson limited edition of three copies, unsigned, bound in tact, and coated with a foul smelling medicament concocted by Dr. Fang

think the interesting thing about that piece is so it demonstrates how marvelously my work has developed over the last nine years. It seems, you know, there's there's been this incredible development of themes. I think, actually one of the things I don't write about bears very often. But funnily enough, I did write about bears this week, in a piece called me and my bear, which I will read to you now. The heavy bear who goes with me, and manifold honey to smear his face, clumsy and lumbering here and there. I wish I could say what kind of bear he is. Others no doubt can tell you. But I'm afraid I'm a trembling bundle of earth sign ignorance. I have no idea which pigeon hole to put this bear into. What I do know is that I am wholly responsible for it. I know this because the bear came to me in a dream, and in dreams begin responsibilities. It was a vivid dream, perhaps because shortly before resting my head on the pillow, I had tucked into an enormous sandwich, in which many a pickle had been inserted. Pickles of all kinds. I know more about pickles than I do about bears. But that's neither This is neither the time nor the place for pickle matters. In my dream, I think it was the year 1909 and I felt as if I were in a Motion Picture theater, the long arm of light crossing the darkness and spinning my eyes fixed on the screen. It was a silent picture, as if an old Biograph one in which the actors are dressed in ridiculously old fashioned clothes. And one flash succeeds another with sudden jumps, the actors to seem to jump about and walk too fast. The shots themselves are full of dots and rays, as if it were raining when the pictures were photographed. The light is bad. It was that kind of film. Suddenly, among all these jumping actors, the lumbered interview the heavy bear, the central tan of every place, the hungry, beating brutish one in love with candy, anger, and sleep, eyes met, and I felt oh so vividly, that from now on until one of us died. This bear was my responsibility, which is all very well in the world of dreams, but gave me something of a start. When I woke up, and found the bear all too heavy and solid and Good heavens, real slumped at the foot of my bed. I squeaked in fear, but soon enough, learned there was nothing to be frightened of. It is a very placid bear all things considered, except for those times when it is shoveling all and climbing buildings and kicking footballs and boxing. It's brother bears in the hate filled city. But it has never laid a poor on me. Indeed, it seems to take great pains to be helpful, acting like a crazy factotum. It has proved to be an interesting few weeks, getting used to having my every footstep dogged by a heavy bear. It's certainly caused a bit of a rumpus in social situations and on public transport. It never before occurred to me that bears were not welcome on buses. Given the behavior of a number of human passengers, this seems a huge injustice. I have tried to explain to bus drivers that the bear is my responsibility and goes with me everywhere, but they're not willing to listen. So we've done a heck of a lot of walking me and my bear up hill and down Dale and along all those lanes that the buses ply.

I am so tired at the end of each day that I have sworn off pickle sandwiches, but I still find it hard to sleep. This is because breathing up my side. That heavy animal that heavy bear Who sleeps with me housed in his sleep for a world of sugar. This despite the fact that I have made a complete change to my breakfast, or as our Flemish pals call it, head on to bite diet. No more eggs and sausages and smokers Pop Tarts for me. I've been buying enormous quantities of sugar puffs, dozens of cartons at a time. For those of you unfamiliar with British breakfast cereal brands, sugar puffs are made from sugar coated wheat flavored with honey by the Quaker Oats company. My bear seems to like them. And in fact, it has been feeding on sugar puffs for lunch and dinner and supper as well as breakfast. But it's still housed in its sleep. And it's getting heavier. I am stuck with my bear and I'm not complaining. But I noticed in the paper the other day that the local flea pit has a screening next week of an old Biograph Motion Picture called actors in ridiculously old fashioned clothes, jumping about and walking too fast in dots and rays with a bear horse gak 1909 I wonder what will happen to my bear when it sees itself up on the screen? It came to me in a dream will abandon me when it sees the dream will it take responsibility for itself and find its own sugar puffs? I will let you know.

When I say I wrote that piece I did write a lot of it but a lot of it is is quotations from Delmore Schwartz. From his poem, the heavy bear that goes with me I think something like that. And from his story in dreams begin responsibilities. Delmore Schwartz, of course, the great hero of Lou Reed. I think he taught Lou Reed University and course one of the one of the I think European some on the first Velvet Underground album is dedicated to Delmore Schwartz. And there's a great song on the Blue Mosque. Blue reads album The blue mask, which is his kind of homage to Delmore Schwartz. I always feel that Lou Reed is somehow both a genius and a complete fool at the same time. Anyway, I was told that he may be there is one body of opinion, which is that the most boring man in rock music is Paul Simon. But someone told me that, in fact, Lou Reed may be the most boring man in rock music, someone who met him reported that their entire conversation was about how great it was that suitcases now came with wheels. So you didn't have to heave them about he could just roll them behind you and Lou Reed seem to find this fascinating. Anyway, enough of all that, when I when I was looking around to discover that piece about the diving helmet, I found I just chanced upon something else that had appeared on the hooting yard website way back in 2004. And it was a quotation from the magnificently titled book by Abigail Stanley Hannah, called withered leaves from memories Garland, published in 1857. You might need a box of tissues to also rag to wipe your eyes as the tears begin to stream. Next to Rosa Whittier sat Julia balcom with saddened expression of countenance and large, deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper expression of melancholy in their glances than is usual to them. Marry age of childhood and elicited your sympathy. Err, you knew her history. Trulia was a cripple. She was drawn to school by an older sister, with rosy cheeks, bright flashing black eyes, and a sprightly animated countenance and carried into the school room in the arms of her teacher, or some of the oldest scholars. And so she came year after year, mingling with the Mary group. But where is she now? Yon little mound of heat up Earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can but hope that she who was denied the privilege of walking on Earth, may now saw on Angel's wings. This dead child was obliged to crawl from place to place after her more favored companions, dragging her useless perished limbs behind her back, but he who cares for us, knew what was best for her, and we cannot doubt his infinite wisdom.

He was out by the Tar Pits as usual, thinking hard about tar. As usual, tar occupied his thoughts when he went to the tar pits, but the rest of the time, he could dismiss it, tar from his head. He was a carrot top, and he smelled the fresh mown grass. Tar is a product of the destructive distillation of organic substances. It is a highly complex material, varying in its composition, according to the nature of the body from which it is distilled. different products, moreover, being obtained according to the temperature, at which the process of distillation is carried on. As a commercial product, there are two principal classes of tar in use woodstar, the product of the special distillation of several varieties of wood and coal tar, which is primarily a byproduct of the distillation of coal during the manufacture of gas for illuminating purposes. These tars are intimately related to bitumen, asphalt, mineral pick, and petroleum. He knew more with and the more he thought about it, the more his head became tar filled almost up to the brim. It was a relief to Lola over to the pier, and to board the waiting paddle steamer and chug along the wide important river all the way home. For a paddle steamer snack, he had a blood orange in a paper bag. He leaned on the rail, eating his snack and keeping an eye on the riverbank in hopes of spotting an author. When he was not at the tar pits, thinking about tar, much of his time was spent trying to devise a working otter scanner. he envisioned some sort of contraption to be worn on his head with a visor that could be lowered with viewfinders attached, and a handheld control panel with lights and buzzers was there a river bank Creek to more glorious than the author? He thought not. Yet the pull of the tar pit was irresistible. Sometimes, as soon as he disembarked at the pier close to home, he turned tail and reboarded the paddle steamer and went straight back. Then he thought hard about wood tar woodstar, also known as stock Archangel tar is principally prepared in the great pine forests of central and northern Russia, Finland and Sweden. The material chiefly employed is the resonance schools and roots of the scotch fiber and the Siberian large, with other less common for tree root.

A large amount of top is also prepared from the root of the swamp pine in North and South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama, in the United States. In the distillation of wood, a series of products including gas, tar, Pyro, legionnaires, acid, acetone, wood, spirit, and charcoal may be obtained. And any of these may be the primary object of the operation. He had never been to any of those places to Russia, or Finland, or Sweden, to North or South Carolina, or Georgia, or Alabama in the United States. He had never been anywhere really safer along the wide important river from his home to the tar pits and back, but he had no wanderlust and he was a moral Cretan. A portion of fruit in a paper bag was his favorite snack. He did not care much which fruit. He used the same paper bag day in day out until it was tattered and torn and felt a bit. Then he asked the green grocer for a fresh paper bag. The green grocer was a huge beast of a man with a florid face and one withered arm and he did not give out paper bags willy nilly, but he liked to hear tales of tar. woodstar is used in medicine under the name of fix liquidator its preparation under ventum pikers liquid dye is composed of wood tar and yellow beeswax. Externally tar is a valuable stimulating dressing in scaly skin diseases such as psoriasis and chronic eczema. Internally, wood tar is a popular remedy as an expectorant in sub acute and chronic bronchitis. It is usually given us Tarwater, one part of wood tar being stirred into four parts of water and filtered. Given internally tar is likely to upset the digestion taken in large quantities, it causes pain and vomiting and dark urine symptoms similar to carbolic acid poisoning. That is what he told the greengrocer when applying for his most recent new paper bag. It was a hot Thursday in August, and he had some bright ideas in his head about the auto scanner. He bought a Carlsbad plum to go in his new paper bag and headed towards the pier. Ah, sweet mystery of life. At last I found the ah, I know at last the secret of it all. Although longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning, the burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall, tar and otters, otters and tar.

The tar found in Tar Pits is not actually tar.

Now they're finally this week. There are bits of bits of this piece that you will have heard before, but in a slightly different format. And other than that, it's great stuff. So I'm going to read it again even if you've heard it before because it's very very good. I stressed that the quotations rather than my own work but framed in I'll just shut up and read it. We know how important it is to eat three square meals a day. But what should those meals be? I've been doing some important research on this matter, and have devised what we might call the ostrich Prince magician diet. breakfast first where we follow the example of a 20th century ostrich in London Zoo. This bird ingested a lace handkerchief, a buttoned glove, a length of rope, a plain handkerchief, probably a man's assorted copper coins, metal tacks, staples and hooks, and the foreign nail. Do not be alarmed by the fact that the ostrich died. Everything dies eventually. But let us make sure we tuck into splendid breakfast before we do. And it's possible, referring you again to the hooting yard website. If you rummage around, you can find a link to a photograph of all the things that the ostrich ate very neatly laid out after it and died. And if you can't be bothered to rummage around if you wait until tomorrow, may the third I'm gonna sneeze if you wait until going forward the Third of May in the dabbler which is at the dabbler.co. UK I think this piece will appear there and there's a link to link to the picture. Anyway that that's breakfast now lunch. For lunch, we can do no better than to replicate a list of the grub Russell that bought the merchant Taylor's company to welcome Prince Henry into their ranks in the summer of 1607 swans, godwit shovelers partridges, owls cuckoo's ring doves pull it ducklings teal, peacocks rabbit Leverett and a great turkey along with 1300 eggs, three great lobsters and 200 prawns, salmon salt fish place so Dori carp and tengiz solo ins and ribs of beef, mutton and lamb. Dow's it. Neat tongues and sweetbreads and figs dates, prunes, current almonds, strawberries, gooseberries, cherries, pears, apples, damsons, oranges, and quintus 28 barrels of beer were provided to slyke the diners thirst, together with more than 440 gallons of wine. And that list is taken from a book by Ian Donaldson a biography of Ben Johnson, published in 2011. And finally for dinner, nothing beats the repast enjoyed by a certain do for described by Harry Houdini. In his 1921 book, miracle mongers and their methods, a complete expose of the modus operandi of fire eaters heat resistors poison eaters, venomous reptile defiers, sword swallowers, human ostriches, strong men, etc.

and I quote, The dinner began with a soup of ASPs in simmering oil. On each side was additional vegetables, one containing thistles and burdock and the other fuming acid. Other side dishes of turtles, rats, bats and mold. Were garnished with live coals for the fish cause he ate a dish of snakes in boiling, tar and pitch. His roast was a screech owl in a source of glowing brimstone. The salad proved to be spider webs full of small explosive squids, a plate of butterfly wings and manner worms, a dish of Toad surrounded with flies, crickets, grasshoppers, church beetles, spiders and caterpillars. He washed all this down with flaming brandy, and for dessert ate the four large candles standing on the table, both of the hanging side lamps with their content. And finally, the large center lamp oil wick and all this leaving the room in darkness to fours face Shawn out in a mask of a living flames. And I'll leave you with that.
