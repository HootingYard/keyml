Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. Live from London. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. Now, first show of 2016, in which we will celebrate hooting yobs radio shows 12th birthday. Which leads me to realize that if we're still around in a year's time, a year or a year and a quarter, hooting yard on the air will become an unruly teenager. best not to think about that. Anyway, that's the future but let us think briefly about the past. Over 40 years ago, David Bowie demanded lay me place and bake me pie, not unreasonably in the circumstances, as he added on starving for me gravy. We've all I think, been there, as they say nowadays, I've certainly had gravy hankerings of my own, most recently, this very morning. Oddly enough, the first stirrings of a gravy craving stole upon me shortly after I'd finished my breakfast of eggy cornflakes and smokers pop tarts. I left the house to take a turn around the duck pond over by the viaduct And there came a constriction in my throat, a throbbing in the head, and a Pang in the belly. gravy. I thought, I'm starving for me gravy. I was unlikely to find any gravy by the duck pond. So I wheeled about and set off in the opposite direction towards the parade of shops. Past the Hatters and the Haberdashers and the ironmongers there is a pie shop. To my dismay, I saw that its shutters were down, and there was no aroma of baking. I hammered my fists upon the shutters, and screamed the words of David Bowie quoted earlier. Clearly gravy starvation was playing havoc with my common sense, for as I well knew, the pie shop did not have an in store dining facility. So even had it been open. I could not sensibly have demanded that my place be laid. I might touch a den that the ironmonger came out of his shop next door to see what was afoot. He was armed with a sample of his ironmongery a wrench or a crowbar and who can blame him. I was hardly the picture of an upstanding citizen in my gravy, famished hysteria. He dealt me a hefty thump on my cranium and used harsh words sprawled on the paving slabs. I got an apology for causing such a racket. I was about to explain that I was starving for my gravy. When the iron manga recognized me. Good grief, stipendiary landgrave suivent to the county Infanta. It is you he cried and immediately proceeded to mumble his own fawning apology, helping to my knee to my feet and dusting me down as he did so Unhand me tradesperson I barked. Just tell me why the pie shop is shot when I am in need of me gravy. By such direct questioning did I learn that the pie shop proprietor had taken leave of absence to attend an important festival in a neighboring land he had left at dawn apparently in a cabriolet, both his face and none of his horse. dogged with cosmetics in the guise of Aladdin Sane. I had forgotten all about the Bowie song. With well practiced aristocratic disdain. I tossed a coin to the iron monger and told him to return to a shop. Then I continued along the parade towards old Mrs. Snuggle B's Dickensian dining parlor, a place of grease and spoons, only to discover that she too had left town. And for the same reason, though the urging begging outside her door, told me she was an officiant Nardo of the Berlin trilogy and had gone to the festival under Japanese influence in action. Bono, clutching her set of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies cards. I needed an oblique strategy of my own. If I was going to get me gravy.

I decided to pop along to the palace to call on the county Infanta. After all, I was asked to Pendry landgrave this weekend, so I was always welcome. She was a tiny little thing being an Infanta and I suspected she had not yet graduated to solid foods. That being the case, there might well be some gravy available. I hustled past the I bustle past the sergeant at arms and made straight for the pallet kitchen. I did not expect to see the Infanta herself in these lowly skivvies quarters, but they actually was gurgling away sitting in a tin can. I am about to feed her in fantan us her elevens is, said the cook. Would you like some? I was appalled by the cooks overfamiliar tone, but so gravy, deranged that I let it pass. I will if you'd having gravy, I cried. No. When she's sitting in her tin, can I make her swallow a couple of protein pills, said the cook. Dammit, I could have cried pulling rank, but I was fraught and weary. I walked down some protein pills reached over to the sideboard for a helmet, put the helmet on and climbed into the tin can next to the Infanta. Soon, thanks to the palace's winch and pulley operators. We would be floating far above the moon. There is no gravy on the moon.

So that was a little homage to David Bowie. 69th birthday is tomorrow. And that piece will appear tomorrow in the dabbler which for which I write something every week. The diablo.co.uk I think is the address. And if you go there tomorrow, you can read that piece. Anyway, the New Year got off to an auspicious start for me. Almost the first words I heard on New Year's Day. After tuning into farming today on BBC Radio four were Swan guru. Outside it was still the dark before dawn, but I resolved with New Year vim to go in search of my very owns one guru. I wasn't listening to the radio with sufficient attention to learn whether a swan guru was, on the one hand, a human being possessed of breathtaking insight into swans, or on the other hand, a swan possessed of breathtaking spiritual insight, which could act as my teacher and guide. But I knew which one I preferred, and it wasn't the human being. And so as the first light of the New Year spread across the sky like a patient he theorized upon a table, I set out for nameless pond in search of a swan. As I looked towards the pond, I record the popular hooting yard series notable authors excuse me, after that paragraph again. As I love up towards the pond, I record the popular hooting yard series notable offers sitting on swans, which featured photographs of famous authors sitting on swans, the swan upon which the infant Raymond Roussel SAT, for example, was it a mere Swan? Or was it the writers swamp guru? I did not suppose I would never know the answer to that question. But just posing it made me all the keener to lay claim to my own Swan guru. standing at the edge of nameless pond, on which several sprightly and savage New Year swans were scouting, I tried to determine which one would be the perfect spiritual teacher. But then I was struck by two thoughts. One. I'm extremely myopic, too. I'm all for logically ignorant. If I were to pick a particular Swan here or now as my guru, would I be able to recognize that Swan on subsequent visits to nameless pond? I had to concede that this seemed unlikely. In my world, a swan is a swan is a swan. Well, then, that being so why not choose the swan nearest at hand as my guru? Next time I came here, the nearest Swan might well be an entirely different swan. But did that really matter? So long as I received from it the spiritual soccer I sought. Convinced that I'd hit upon an effective method of mitigating my myopia and ornithological ignorance. I fixed my gaze upon the nearest swan. The next couple of minutes would prove critical. I had to lay myself open, fully receptive to whatever spiritual wisdom the swan saw fit to impart to me. The better To accomplish this, adopt open mouth dribbling slightly like a dim witted child. I tried to empty my brain of all conscious thought, and I succeeded so well that I toppled over having forgotten how to stand up bright. sprawled in the pond side mud, I sensed a terrifying inrush of what I can only describe as swana. So Swan oddity, it surged through me magnificently. I stood up, dusted myself down a bit adhere to my Swan guru with a wave of my hand, and set off for home row betide anybody I met along the way, with one of my when I would break their arm.

I've just been handed a laminated sheet of a4 with a message to read out. resonance. FM's annual fundraiser runs from February the 13th, to the 21st, featuring nine days of live events, a spectacular online auction, as well as a whole host of special broadcasts. resonance relies on the support of our listeners, help us make more amazing programming by heading to resonant.fm to make a contribution. That's what it says, and I, I endorse that message. It's very important that you do send money to resonance, and we will have the channel where you can do that now. I mean, you can do that anytime you like. In fact, it right in front of me that this is a little collecting tin. It's not a tin Actually, it's made of plastic, but you can hear the coinage. You too can contribute. You can contribute now. And then you can contribute again during the fundraiser week in February next month, starts just over a month today. And spigot boy was the eponymous hero of a cartoon strip that ran in the children's comic the Ipsy Dipsy do during the early 1950s. Each week spigot boys adventures stuck to a rigid formula. The Strip consisted of just four panels, in the course of which the towel head micpa would happen upon an imminent act of civic malfeasance, which he would then foil by disguising himself as a spigot. Given these limitations there was in each episode, but will during fecundity of invention. That wait no doubt went over the heads of the infant readership. One of the great pleasures of the spigot boy script was that in each episode, at least one of the speech bubbles would contain a direct quotation from the works of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Almost always, the words chosen seem to fit seamlessly with no sense that they'd been shoehorned in. Occasionally, of course, adherence to the formula meant there was a rather forced gratuitous quality to the Hopkins quotation. But even when that did happen, the strip was saved by, for example, the inclusion of a startlingly executed picture of a wheat here, or unattach in the sky, just above and to the left of spiggott boy's head in the moments before he adopted his spigot disguise on foil the schemes of that week's civic malefactor. The Strip was discontinued after the Edit tricks of the Ipsy Dipsy do realized that the villains in each episode were in fact crude caricatures of some of the leading professional footballers of the day, many of whom were called either Wali or Nat. One seldom meet with top flight professionals named Wally or Nat in the game nowadays, which is a great pity. But there again, one seldom meets with the towel head nipper, fictional or otherwise, who can expertly disguise himself as a fully functioning spigot at the drop of a hat. That, I think is a greater pithy and I should know, because I know more about pity than anyone, pity party and put it those are my areas of expertise. And you would do well to remember that, for when I am crossed, my rages are terrible, not unlike those of a 1950s infant whose copy of the Ipsy Dipsy do has been snatched from this tiny little hands and cast into the fire, where it says consumed by flames more terrible than the flames of the deepest pit of hell.

I wrote the light shining in Buckingham share. My version was completely different to the original, and anonymous digger cracked of 1648. Though it was written in archaic prose, and contained a plethora of commas. Indeed, it contains many, many more commas than I would ever be likely to deploy. All things considered when acting in the waking world, sound much duller, most of the time, the phantasmal world of sleep, and by acting Of course, I mean writing the act of writing, in prose, with commas, but boy, oh boy, not half as many commas as I or rather, the dream of me, managed to pack in furiously, so many they were tripping each other up almost in light shining in Buckingham share the dream version. That last sentence may be grammatically compromised, but that's the price you pay for a plethora of commas. My text was handwritten, and it was clear or dream clear that it would remain as an addition of one. Nevertheless, I got the strong impression that my light shining in bucking and fear was considered by readers to be the best thing I had ever written. I'm not sure how I gained this impression, but you know, dreams or dreams. It's a pity then, that I cannot remember in the waking world, a single word of the text. All I recall is the archaic prose and those damn commas. Anyway, I'm now planning to pay a visit to Buckingham shear and to study the light, and to make copious notes on the light in my pocket book with my propelling pencil. And then, Upon my return from Buckingham here to parlay those notes into a piece of majestic prose, handwritten in an edition of one I'll let you know when I'm done, and you can make an appointment to come and read it.

Frank Key  20:13
And so I went as planned to Buckingham share their study the light approached accounting along a path in Berkshire not wishing it but it's back here isn't it? I always say Berkshire. I'm going to start again and I'm going to pronounce it Berkshire even though it's probably meant to be bout here. And so I went as planned to Buckingham share there to study the light. I approached the county along a path in Berkshire, not wishing to waste any time, I'd already taken my pocketbook out of my pocket, and was holding in my other hand, by propelling pencil drew be propelled and ready for writing. As I stepped across the invisible county boundary, the sun was blotted out, and Buckingham shear was in shrouded in darkness. It took a few moments for me to realize what had happened, a gigantic flock of gigantic bird that swept across the sky, so gigantic of flock and the birds so densely packed together, that the sun's rays could not break through. Well, I said to myself, that is an uncommon phenomenon, to be sure, but the birds will fly fiver and the ceremonial county of bucking machine will again be based in light, light, which I will study and make notes upon prepper tree to my handwritten pamphlet on the subject. But having swooped in front of the sun, the gigantic flock of birds stopped. I could not see very well because it was so dark, but they appear to be hovering in the air static, but for such flapping their wings has kept them buoyant. The uncommon phenomenon had become uncommon are still not knowing what to do, I decided to eat a sausage. I had several sausages about my person in two different paper bags into different pockets. I hope that in the time it took me to eat a sausage, particularly if I nibbled it slowly, the birds would after all swoop elsewhere. I had passed several yards back a path time bench, or suitable spot to consumer sausage snack. So I turned and headed towards it. As I did so, I inevitably crossed from Buckingham share back into Berkshire, and listen carefully. At that precise moment. The flock of birds continued their swooping and the sun reappeared and light was shining in Buckingham share. If an uncommon phenomenon can become uncommon, a still and then even uncommon a yet then that is what I had witnessed, are well I said to myself, perhaps I will delay that sausage and start making notes on the light. But as I turned again, and stepped again into Buckingham share that damageable flock of birds swooped in front of the Sun again and stayed hovering there. blotting out all light. Well high being taunted by birds. There was a simple way to find out. I took a step back into Berkshire, the birds flew away. I stepped forward into Buckingham share again, the flock swooped in front of the sun, and crunch the world into darkness. I say this little pantomine several more times, like a fool. And always with the same result. I retreated to the bench in Berkshire and sat down and ate a sausage. It was while I was eating the sausage that it occurred to me to make notes on the light in backing and fear from my vantage point a few yards across the county boundary. Then I would not have the pesky birds to contend with. But in the time it took me to eat the rest of the sausage. I have second thought unless pernickety person might have studied the light in Buckinghamshire while sitting a few yards outside the county in Berkshire. But I am pernickety. I have not studied the science of optics with any great diligence or even at all, but one thing I know is that light, the thing the phenomenon is perceived by the eyes and it's the act of perception, the stimulation of the optic nerves. That is the essence as it were, of the light

Frank Key  25:03
absent the eye, the light is futile or indeed non existent by this reasoning, if I'm in Berks here, then so is the light. I can only see light shining in backing of here if I'm in Buckingham share. But the birds of Buckingham share, or at least a gigantic flocks worth of them were plainly determined to prevent me from seeing that light. Oh, vindictive birds. A poor Scribbler, sets out on a journey to record the fascinating subject of light shining in Buckinghamshire, and he is thwarted by unfeeling savages of the sky conspiring against him. Now, I had nothing whatsoever to write about. I put my pocketbook back in my pocket, tucked my propelling pencil away in another pocket and ate another sausage sitting on a bench in Berkshire, where the light I'm sorry, just say, with US dollars ditch water

Frank Key  26:48
is nearly the end of the show. But before we go, I just like to read. I got a I posted the light shining in Buckingham share on the hooting God website hooting yard.org and Dave commented, I think that's Dave who made a theremin out of a badger. He sent me a quotation from Thomas de Quincey which contained lots of duck whistles a quintic like commas to and I think I've just about got time to read the quotation from Thomas de Quincey. such cases remind one to forcibly have the pretty horatian tale, where in a contest between two men who undertake to mimic a pig grunting he who happens to be the favorite of the audience is applauded to the echo phase, felicitous execution and repeatedly encored whilst the other man is history off the stage, and well kicked by a band of amateurs and Cognoscenti as a poor miserable copyist and imposter. But unfortunately, for the credit of his exploders he has just time before they have quite kicked him off for exposing to view the real pig concealed under his cloak, rich piggy it was and not himself, that had been the artist forced by pinches into mimicry of his own poolside music. And that was Thomas de Quincey to end on grunting pigs to end this week's show. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.

This is vanilla fielding. I'm listening to resonance FM, London's most fabulous art radio station. It's lovely. Isn't it?
