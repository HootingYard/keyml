Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. Oh, to be in Pepin Stowe, among the toughest adept, which will stand in a ring around the bonfire, breathing in the fumes and snorting like bears. On the other hand, might it not be safer to be barricaded indoors behind shutters with a pile of rags ready to set a fire and fleeing from the rooftop? Whenever I find myself in such a quandary, I seek counsel from my pal Aesop, who lives in a tin hat at the end of a long and bosky Lane. I set off to see him taking with me two loaves of bread. And on the way I sold one of the loaves and bought a higher sense and aesthetic touch I learned from sweetie Appleyard, a softwood, I knew happily wolf down the bread while I contemplated the flower, which we would plop into a vase on his window sill or mantle piece. Perhaps I should point out that Aesop was not named after the ancient Greek fabulist, so people invariably assumed that to be the case, after all, one week with very, very few Aesop's these days, and I cannot think of anyone else of my acquaintance who goes by that moniker. As far as my power was concerned, it was simply that his power and Mar liked the name. His sister was called a tosser, for the same reason, and not because the parents had a thing about the daughter of Cyrus the Great, and the mother of Xerxes, the first In fact, they weren't ignorant pair who knew nothing of the ancient Greeks, nor of ancient Rome, nor Sparta, nor Carthage, nor of the Chaldees, and it must be said that I saw himself was pretty sick. Quite the dimwit one of the reasons I bought the highest since was to give me something to concentrate on while he gobbled down the loaf of bread. His table manners were absolutely awful, like friends catheters. But the miraculous thing about Aesop was in spite of his stupidity, he always dispensed judicious advice, at least on matters related to tongued ism. He had you see once been an adept himself, unlikely as that may seem, though, beetle brown and inarticulate and in sanitary, he had been privy to the mysteries. It was never clear to me whether they drugged him out or if he had to escape their tongue disc clutches. But either way, he now had to remain in hiding in his tin hat at the end of the line, sheltered in clumps of large laburnum, hornbeam and pine, those being the four kinds of tree which grow in and around Pepin stone by dint of the soil conditions. I'm tempted to Sally off on a digression regarding the many Tom dissed proclamations about soil, those dealing with dry crumbly soil, the winnowing of it through sieves, the transformation of soil into mud through the agency of rain or ditch water, the commingling of soil with blood on battlefields scarred by war, the distribution of pebbles within expanses of soil, soil, the home of worms as of untold creeping things, the Claudy nature of impacted soil and the engine of impaction whether organic or machine, circumstances of soil pulverization, salts, agricultural, horticultural and botanical and the related yet separate issues important to tundish of day soil and night soil and the employment of night soil men, their wages and duties and equipage. But all this can be studied more profitably as source. For example, in one of the many Tom disks soil journals publicly available. The unholy snorting and bellowing of the Pepin slow tractor of tundish could still be heard, though, frankly, as I approached ever closer to a soft tin hut smothered under the clumps at the End of the Lane. It was 745 in the evening tundish time when I bashed my fist on his door, the loaf of bread was still fresh and the highest since on wilted 746. The door creaked open. To my surprise there in the vestibule stood not

a sob, but his sister, a tosser, who might have not seen for many years. She did not recognize me and she is as much a Dunder pate as her brother. So I had to explain at length who I was and why I had come a calling, and why I held in one hand a loaf of bread in a paper bag, and in the other hand, not in a bag a hyacinth. By the time I was done with all this rigmarole, enunciated in ringing tones, the better to penetrate a tosses wax blockaded, is, it was 752 it need hardly be said that time is of the essence to tandis and thus to those whose quandaries skitter within a tongue dist purview. Soon enough, it would be eight o'clock and the bonfires in Pepin. Stowe would be at their height, ready for burnings, and not any old burnings, but tongue just burnings. I toss a scowled but she led me into the hat pointing with her shriveled white hand to the carpet were a soft place sprawled in the gloom. I thought he was dead. But of a sudden he leaped to his feet and shook my hand with his usual muscular vim, making me wince. He snatched a loaf of bread and began gobbling, paper bag and door, an empty vase stood on the mantel piece, so I dropped the highest infant into it set for contemplation. When you finished eating Aesop, perhaps you could advise me on my quandary, I said, I mean two minds whether to join the tundish the depth, standing in a ring around the bonfire, breathing in the fumes and snorting like bears, or conversely, with my hat of caution on my head to be barricaded indoors behind shutters with a pile of rags ready to set a fire and fling from the rooftop. What say you pal Aesop. He still had his mouthful of bread, so I waited for the quandary to laundry in his brain during his chewing. What I did not expect was for his sister a tosser to jump straight in with her own unsolicited advice. You are not in Pepin stone anymore, she said. You have entered into the tin hat of a tasa as it will henceforth be known. Here all is dim, both light and wits. Stay with us, Mr. For at eight o'clock sharp. We shall be world up in the air on storm tossed currents blowing Ooh, ferocious. We'll want you for ballast. It was one minute to eight. I had 60 seconds to decide my fate. At that very moment, Aesop swallowed his last mouthful of bread belched as he does fixed me with his black vacant eyes and said I forget exactly what he said that he was inarticulate. Though I recall there was something about soil, possibly night soil, I threw myself out of the tiny heart, the tin heart, just as it was lifted clear of the ground by storm tossed currents. Later, back in Pepin stone, I saw the tongue just fires burning, the adept with silence now and ominous. I crept in shadows past my chalet all the way past it until I reached the kiosk of the night soil man, it was empty, save for a coat hanger, on which hung a bright new uniform. I tried it on. It was a perfect fit. Night would fall soon, soon, and I would be ready.

I'm pleased to inform listeners that there's been an interesting cultural development, trying to bring together classics of avant garde rock music with that kind of Saturday evening, television drama, Sunday evening television drama, you know, that's very kind of peaceful and nice and nothing bad ever happens. And the first like larkrise to candleford being the perfect example. And the first artifact from this is a kind of rerecording of trout mask replica by Captain Beefheart in the magic band, with the vocals done in that kind of BBC costume drama generic peasant accent. And here is here is old fart at play. Those of you who know trout mask replica sort of done like Laura Roy used to candleford poppy with the khaki sweatband bold goat potbelly barnyard The only he noticed the old fart was smart, the old gold class Madonna dance into the fiddle and saw he ran down behind the Knoll and slipped on his wooden fish head. The mouth worked and snapped all the bees back to the bungalow. Mama was flattening lard with her read and I'm a rolling pin. When the fish had broke the window, rubber oil You wrecked and precisely detailed airholes for which breath should come is now closely fit with the cat or of the old fart inside. An assortment of observations took place. My more literal lips like a cat Peck the ground like a rooster pivoted like a duck or stockings down called Dustin dough balls. She cracked her mouth glaze caught one eyelash rubbing her hands on a gorgeous gingham or hand grasps sticky metal intricate latch work open to the room smell cold mixed with belanja rubber bands crumpled wax paper bonnets, fat goose legs and special jellies ignited by the warmth of the room. The old forest smelled this through is important breather holes. cleverly he dialed from within. From the outside we observed that the nose of the wooden mask where the holes had just been a moment ago was now smooth, amazingly blended, camouflaged in with a very intricate rainbow crowd replica. The old fart inside was now breathing freely from his perfume bottle atomizer error bulb invention has excited eyes from within the dark interior glazed, watered in appreciation of his thoughtful preparation.

So there you are the larkrise to candleford version of old fart at play by Don vanvleet. One November morning that say I'd messed up that sentence or sad again. One rain last November morning in the latter half of the 1950s. Dobson awoke from uneasy dreams and succumbed to a fit of Ernesto mania at the breakfast table after flat colorizing his steamed dough and gooseflesh Flan he announced to marigold two Oh enamorado mine. what the world needs is a pamphlet decisively written on the flight patterns of the common Shrike. marigold to let this intelligence sink in while she managed her Calgary. This was the period it ought to be noted. When the out of print pamphleteer and his Bell kept to differing breakfast menus, later to be chronicled in the pamphlet to come recipe book 1000 breakfasts in 500 days out of print. munching dumb marigold two asked pointedly Are you intending to pen this pamphlet yourself? Dobson? To which the pamphleteer replied after a long pause while he masticated a mouthful of flang 32 times. Yes, of course. marigold, choo side, Dobson, she said, not unkindly, you know, nothing of the Shrike. I doubt you could tell one apart from a robin or a Starling, or a pratten Cole or even a vulture. How the hell are you going to write decisively or otherwise about the flight patterns of a bird of which your ignorance is limitless I have a one word answer to that replied to Dobson research. So it was that when his breakfast was fully digested, Dobson clambered into his Galician zookeepers boots. Donda threadbare waterproof and stalked out into the rain. He made for the top of pill garlic tour and stared at the sky for hours. When he returned home, he was drenched and dusk was descending. Well asked marigold to what have you learned? The sky is a vast expanse set to Dobson across which clouds scarred and from these clouds falls rain now is drizzle now in sheets, hence the puddle forming at my feet, which I shall mop up with a mop on the end of the stick when I have done enlightening you my darling dear. From time to time. Below the scudding clouds, birds saw and swoop across the sky. Some go fleeting until they can no longer be perceived by the human eye. Some coming to land on the branches of trees or in nests built high or low in trees, or even in hedgerows. There are many different types of birds, many more than the ones you catalogued over breakfast this morning. Each has a distinctive manner of keeping itself airborne. Through keen and judicious observation, one can learn to differentiate one type of bird from another purely from its method of flight without needing to get close up to it. For example, while it is resting in its nest, or on a tree branch, as my pamphlet will be devoted exclusively to the common shrikes flight patterns, that closer observation in the nest will not be necessary. That is fortunate, for I much prefer to stand wind swept and rain lashed upon the top of the tour than to be hunkered in shrubbery for hours on end, where I would be subject to biting by insect and other things that crawl upon the earth and in shrubs. There are goos one can smear upon the skin to repel such creatures said marigolds to waving her hand towards a wall mounted cabinet were in such goos were stored. That may be so sad to Dobson but if you are listening attentively, you will grasp that for present purposes I need no such repellent. So will you be standing atop pill garlic tour again tomorrow staring at the sky asked marigold true. I will not set Dobson for tomorrow I will be consulting works of ornithological reference in the library. And lo it came to pass the following morning after a breakfast of eggy buns Dobson and lightly grilled hen head with tomatoes marigold to

Frank Key  18:06
the pamphleteer was to be found poring over an enormous ornithological reference work in the ornithological reference library Reading Room. In those days, libraries were havens of quiet in what Pratt dubbed the Hurly burly of the urban conurbation. And the only sounds to be heard with a frantic scraping of Dobson's very very sharp pencil as he scribbled upon his daughter, and the strangulated choking of a fellow bird researcher with a predilection for high tax cigarettes. Dobson was making notes from his study of the boys and girls bumper book of shrikes. He copied out one passage in its entirety. Now tinies Let me tell you why the Shrike is known as the butcher bird, you see, it is a right patience and a violent little birdie, and it likes to win crap in its talons insects, smaller birds, and even teeny weeny mammals, like field mice and shrews. once caught is impales. Its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the flesh into smaller, more conveniently sized fragments and serves as a sort of pantry or larder, so the Shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time. It's cold, it's strident. You will probably have nightmares about it now, but it is well to learn that nature is a realm of blood and gore. How did you get on at the library, asked marigold to when Dobson returned, he had trudged home in a downpour and a puddle was forming around his feet, which today were clad in a pair of Paraguayan Mining inspectors boots. It looks as though I'll have more mopping up to do a light of my life, said Dobson. You will no doubt be pleased to hear that I have formed a plan of campaign for the accomplishment of what I suspect will be one of my most important pamphlets. I'm glad to hear it said marigold to who was knocking back a beaker of some fluid she had strained through a sieve earlier that day. Its color was indescribable, and it was PIP free. Dobson took his jata from an inside pocket of his writing code. Listen to this, he said in an excitable voice. The Shrike is a rapacious and violent little birdie, and it likes to entrap in its talents, insects, smaller birds, and even teeny weeny mammals like filled my son shrews. once caught, it impaled its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the flesh into smaller, more conveniently sized fragments and serves as a sort of panfry or ladder so the Shrike can return to the uneven portions at a later time. It's called a Streisand, and that's not all but you get the gist. I do said marigold true. But what is your plan of campaign and when do you do to set it in motion. Using keen and judicious observation from a top pill garlic tour, said Dobson, I will wait to spot a bird impaling an insect or a smaller bird or a field mouse or a shrew or some other tiny mammal a polar Thorn, that I will say to myself, possibly out loud, is a Shrike. It will then be a simple matter of watching it fly away from the thorn and to trace with my pencil in my daughter, the patterns it formed in the sky. This diagram will then form the basis for an accompanying text, which will describe the patterns in decisive prose. The next morning, Dobson ate lobster for breakfast while marigold two had mashed up kaikan crumpets and cornflakes. Then, the pamphleteer headed out for pill garlic tour in the torrential rain, he stationed himself in the vicinity of a thorn bush near the summit and watched keenly and judiciously all day. That was Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were identical in all particulars, except of course for the breakfast. By the time dusk descended on the second Thursday, Dobson was soaked to the skin and had yet to spot a Shrike. He returned home crushed and despondent. marigold Chu could tell from the misery act upon his countenance, that his plan of campaign was yet to bear fruit.

Frank Key  23:02
But as the pamphleteer stood in a puddle in his Latvian ice rink attendant boots, contemplating the mopping he would shortly be engaged in with a mop. She asked. Did you spot a Shrike today Dobson? I did not. He moaned in a voice ancient and sepulchral. I did said marigold, true. Just after you left this morning, I went out into the garden to cast my gaze admiringly upon the hollyhocks. And, gosh, all of a sudden, a bird swooped into view, a newborn hamsters struggling in the vicious grip of its talents, and I was jolted by a wave of nausea as I watched the bird impale the poor, tiny thing upon a thorn in the thorn bush, next to a hollyhock patch beside the shed. Somehow, I managed not to vomit all over the lawn, and I realized the bird was a Shrike. So I ran indoors for my sketchpad and propelling pencil and rock back out in time to see the Shrike fly away there upon executing a tighly accurate rendering of the patterns that formed in the sky. until some minutes later, it was a lost view in the overcast, grey immensity of the rain rattled Imperium, and you're sure it wasn't a pratincole as Dobson assures exit eggs, said marigold true. brandishing the relevant page of her sketchpad in the pamphlet is face now transformed by joy. This is fantastic news, cried Dobson, and he sprang forward and clutched marigold chew in an embrace of boundless love. And that is why the pamphlet flight patterns of the common Shrike by Dobson out of print has the subtitle, with a tremendously accurate diagram by merrigan True. In closing, it's worth noting that Dobson's text, far from being decisive, is incoherent, jumbled and in places quite potty, probably because in the bliss of their wild embrace marigold to sketchpad was dropped into the puddle of rainwater and became smudged. The diagram as published was newly drawn from memory A few days later, and was by no means as tremendously accurate as claimed. In fact, a reputed ornithologist, has said that the flight patterns represented a typical not of the Shrike, but of the pratincole.

And that's the end of this week's edition of hooting yard on the air. I do hope you've enjoyed it. My thanks to mark the engineer who played the part of rocket Morton, in the in the reimagining of old fart at play from trout mask replica. Very good bit. I think it was rocket Morton who said Oh, man, that sounds heavy and one of the magic band anyway. So this has been this has not been heavy. This has been morally uplifting, I hope and I'll be back with more such drivel next week. Bye bye.
