Good evening This is resonance 104 point four f m. Live from London it's hooting yard on the air with me Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for approximately 27 and a half minutes or possibly 28 and a half, something like that. I had several reasons to sail across the sound to stick insect Island. There were rumors of murder and mayhem and pagan sacrifice. My brother had made the crossing a fortnight before, and no word had come from him. My own homecoming was long overdue. And I wondered if the tiny post office still sold those amusing wax dolls of Captain Todd and cadet Jarvis. The poking of them with pins was a delightful memory of my childhood, and I wanted my own nippers to share the experience, even though it would never be quite the same on the mainland. I had been too long gone, I realized as the skipper brought the boat into harbor. The stone walls were greatly weathered. The fishermen taps were dilapidated. The ice cream kiosk was a burned out shell gold swooped and rampaged. You're quite sure you want me to leave you here. Ask the skipper. As I disembarked, I nodded, schlepping some coins into his hairy hand. They were counterfeit, of course, but he would be dead before he could spend them. I walked up the slope past the notary's office and the chapel and sat on the old familiar bench by the fountain. There was nobody about it this hour. In the square the stone statue of cadet Jarvis much bit crumbled, gazed sightless Lee towards the woods, as it had done for a century or more. I hoped my business would not take me into the woods. It was in the woods we found my brother. I was six years old, out with my father for a moonlit walk. Usually when he went out at night to like poisoned bait for wolves. He went alone, but on this occasion, apparently, I had been fractious and keening all day, and he thought the moonlight might become me. My brother was wrapped in a filthy blanket and wedged in the branches of a tree, a sycamore I think, at about, excuse me at about my father's head height. He was about six months old and fast asleep. My father placed him gently in the poison bag and carried him home. We never did discover who had abandoned him there. When his hair grew, it was blank and straight and tare black. The town if you could call it a town began to stir. The Butcher came marching up the street, baring his bloody meat cleaver proudly like a soldier on parade. The Beagle poked his head out of the Bailey and sniffed the air. The lantern extinguisher rolled along in his wheelchair, extinguishing the lanterns one by one. shutters were raised and bells clanged. When the duck man approached the fountain with his ducks in tow. It was time for me to move. I could not help glancing back at the woods as I made my way as inconspicuously as possible towards the stationary shop. The flat above it was where my brother told me he was going to stay. When we parted on the key side two weeks ago, I did not tell him of the knot in the pit of my stomach wrench so tight, I thought I might die. I did not warn him about the flat over the stationery shop. I did not warn him at all.

The shop was not yet open. I pretended an interest in the window display of typewriter ribbons set in a riot of Stan hopers with their pale Tiger flowers which exhale from afar a strong and accurate breath as from the putrid mouths of convalescent invalids. I could smell it through the vents in the window. Eventually I heard bolt strong back and a latch lifted before the door was open. I gave it a shot of knocking the station to the floor. Looking down at his puffy piggy face. I felt both rage and nausea rising within me. But I left him there and without a word barged through to the back of the shop and took the staircase two steps at a time and flung open the door of the flat. I knew at a glance it was an option keypad, popping a six B pill to study my nerves. I began a search that the most diligent bloodhound would envy. I was careful to leave the place looking untouched. But in a quarter of an hour, I had examined every inch of the flat and found Not a trace of my brother. The single anomaly was a black and white photograph of the balletto main Nan Q. propped on the mantle piece. It was singed in one corner. My brother was deaf and blind to the ballet as he was to all the performing arts. I returned downstairs to find the station or in the company of three ruffians. The shop door was locked and bolted again. And so thick was the pungent foliage In the window that the view of the street was completely obscured. I could not see out and of course, no passers by could see in two Tilly lamps had been lit to light the interior. Well, well, well, I said the old gang back together. Have you never been apart? Still ironing each other's trousers? I sounded more confident than I felt. It was many long years since I'd been face to face with the Mets boys. They had terrorized my brother and me as children. They have terrorized the island and it seemed they did so still. You're going to come with us to the woods, said one of the gets his head even puffier and pickier than the Stationers is is looked as if they've been stuck on the wrong way round. I was about to laugh or shriek but one of the others suddenly lunged forward and stomped me in the stomach. We're gonna take you to the Badger sets. He said something may a second time. Those are the words I'd hope never to hear again. There is one dream or nightmare that has recurred throughout my nights. My brother and I sometimes this children sometimes as adults are being driven relentlessly towards the Badger sets in the woods, pursued by the Veldt Schmidt boys, the four of them or sometimes many, many more, more than ever existed in the waking world. They are armed with sticks or bludgeons and they are roaring, we trip and stumble on twigs or tendrils. The wind howls through the swaying trees and uncanny, terrible swaying, our clothing is torn to rags, and we're pressed ever closer to the Badger sets. I always wake before we reach them. And for that I'm thankful. Once sitting in a canteen on the mainland, fiddling with a class on my brother, usually so self possessed, so Bruce confessed to me that he had the same dream at least once a week, more than once it had incapacitated him for days afterwards. The station unbolted his door, and we stepped out into the Milky morning light. The duck man was sitting on the bench smoking while his ducks flashed in the fountain. All the lanterns had been extinguished, and the lantern extinguisher had parked his wheelchair outside the tavern waiting for it to open. From the butcher shop came the sound of savage cleaving, and a steady stream of blood trickled out of the doorway into the gutter, where it was lapped up by dogs. cadet Jarvis's eyes of stone continued their eternal gaze towards the woods, obviously, was to wind it from the thumps to make a run for it. And where would I run to? None of the islanders would help me not even mistress Pim in the post office. Nobody even looked at me as we made our way along the street, across the green and onto the lane. There were dozens of people out and about now, some like sleepwalkers, some hailing each other or stopping to exchange a few words. Words I knew bitterly would be incomprehensible to me now.

I was a stranger here become invisible. They all knew better than to meet my eye to register my presence. I was too much change to any of the older folk to recognize in me, the boy I been, and the plastic surgeons on the mainland were too skilled to leave telltale scars. I didn't even recognize my brother. The first time I saw him, I've cried fled the island. They had changed his height and posture and gait as well as his face. It was only when the unfamiliar figure in the kit of a goat man, a doxy on his arm, leaning on a post in the shadows of the harbor, took from his poor shepherd. The filthy ragged blanket had been wrapped in as a foundling and shyly waved attacked me that I knew him. I ran them, tumbling towards him and kissed him. Would he be there the Badger sets changed once again transformed, made into something awful and strange and grotesque, with paws or flippers and a gigantic twisted head and no eyes, or one eye golden and the other of Ruby, jabbering a mad litany. I've never been able to forget the names of all those who year after year, on the feast day were taken into the woods and never seen again. I tried to forget, we all tried to forget, but we never forgot a single name. Captain Todd cadet Jarvis. Nan que the game the names we grew up with whispered mattered, barely breathed. When we were children, they sent delicious tingles of terror down our spines, which cherished our fearful shadows gathered by the ice cream kiosk under the moonlight, each slosh of right to sea water against the harbor walls, prompting another name counting them off, one by one year by year. We were never told what actually happened to them once they've been taken deep into the woods where the Badger sets were. Now my brother knew, and soon, very soon as the Veldt schmetz boys steered me away from the lane into the woods, I would know too.

Charles Montague doubting 1843 in 1926 is remembered today at all. It says the author of travels in Arabia deserta, a classic account of his wanderings in northern Arabia, published in 1888. One hesitates to call it influential for it's written in a highly rote, archaic, often quite bonkers style, that's probably inimitable. But it has at least been more or less constantly in print since T. Lawrence enthused about it in the 1920s. Unlike doubt, his later works mad epics written in verse so chunky and chewy and Anglo Saxon, they make virtually anything else read like pointy head management guff. The titles include the dawn in Britain, volume, one of which has recently been reissued. I discovered with glee, Adam cast forth, the Titans and man's soul or the riddle of the world. For your edification and enlightenment, I've picked some of my favorite lines and phrases from book one of man's soul. I posted these on the on the hooting yard website and some of the Spelling's are so odd that I had to make a note that I'd double check them to make sure I'd people didn't think I'd miss type them. Anyway, here's just some bits from man Saul by man soul sorry by Charles Montague Dowty. 1920 I think I heard horse murmuring to mild as of see deeps along Main wave rose, beating boisterous and rushing bellows like to raging scour of ravening wolves wide whelming on cliffs and creaking winged Muse clamor flapping around a long foreshore of human souls such a multitude he comprised as clustered blends, some greater and some less, we see often wind driven flock of foam in day of storm on some tempestuous strand I slumbered till a turtle is gentle flock folding from flight there rattling wings lighted on the male feet, jetting with mincing pace there Irish next, with crew Ling throat bowl voice of peace and rest.

I'm gonna get myself a crock of knowledge and put it on a shelf. Certainly given me an idea for a hooting out Christmas special on the site. Listeners may recall unconscious squirrel, the unsuccessful cartoon strip about an unconscious squirrel created and then abandoned by Lamont Pinochet one hesitates to say that the character is much lamented, as nobody took much notice of the strip when it appeared, and Pinochet himself found it tiresome, so much so that they used to fall asleep while drawing it. Now, in a bold move, the unconscious squirrel has been revived in a new pop boiler by pebble head. The nuts of narcolepsy is set in a woodland Hill, where an unsuspecting squirrel eats some poisoned or contaminated nuts, which cause it to swoon into unconsciousness. As ever, the best selling paperback just handles his material in a bravura manner, investing his simple tail with stylistic flourishes and cracking dialogue, displaying an enviable command of the exclamation mark. Early reviews have been positive with Lex pilgrim the daily hubbub monitor, praising it as a real page turner of the sort we expect from pebble head with thrills and spills are plenty while the angling magazine minnows in net noted with approval, its lack of clunk. Curiously, the knots of narcolepsy is dedicated to the memory of Eric Fogg 1903 to 1939, the English composer who fell or possibly threw himself under a tube train at Waterloo station. On the eve of his second marriage, an open verdict was recorded. There is no evidence to Eric fog have a thing about squirrels and pebble head has never expressed any previous interest in him, nor about English music in general. The paperback case is known to be an enthusiast for noisy aggressive Germans, which will have to await the deliberations of those dedicated folk who compile the annual register of deputies of potboilers for enlightenment. interviewed on the porch steps of a particularly sorted bordello pebble had dropped hints that we will be seeing more of the unconscious squirrel. I find he said, There comes a point when my characters take on a life of their own. It's almost as if I'm a reporter, or a biographer, rather than a novelist. You will recall Digby smooth the fascist podcaster who first appeared in my book, the assassination of Stephen Fry, sometimes I fancy he's sitting at breakfast with me. slurping porridge with disgusting table manners. I can't even remember writing the other 40 potboilers of which is the protagonist. The words just come on summoned. I have an inkling that something similar will happen with the unconscious squirrel. Now that the basic lineaments of his character have been established that he's a squirrel, and that He's unconscious. Already, he seems freed from the confines of my own pulsating writerly cranium. I swear to God, he took on comport corporeal form this morning, I was eating my breakfast and across the table, there was Digby smooth, and he was staring at something something behind me and I turned to look and got a fugitive glimpse of a narcoleptic squirrel snuggled against the wainscot shimmering and hulusi Energetic haze for a moment before the vision dissolved, but I know he will be back and I've already felt impelled to dash off 20,000 words of a second unconscious squirrel potboiler. I don't want to give too much away, but in this one he plays a leading role in the Hindenburg disaster. When he was able to get a word in edgewise pebble heads interviewer taxed him with the point that he had not in fact created the unconscious squirrel, but taken him in all his particulars from an almost forgotten cartoon strip by the creator of magnet boy, the boy magnet.

That is indeed true, said the paperback is having now unfurled his umbrella against an unprecedented downpour. And I've never tried to conceal the fact if you knew anything about my work, you would know I have revived and reinvented existing fictional characters before many a time. I have written that the last count 26 short stories about Dr. slop from the life and opinions of Christian Shandy gentleman by Lawrence stern. And I've written a trilogy of sci fi adventures featuring brave driver Joseph bomb from the good soldier shake by Jaroslav hashtag. As a two has become very real to me, though for some reason neither of them ever comes to breakfast. Dr. slop is usually hovering on the landing, while Joseph bongs sits in the potting shed on my allotment whistling the revelation that pebble had maintained and allotment will come as a shock to his readers. How in the name of all his holy one wonders to so indefatigable a paperback just fine time to grow radishes and kohlrabi and tomatoes and potatoes and bug loss and beetroot and hollyhocks. Not only to grow them, but to keep them free of hideous diseases and the predations of tiny parasitic, creeping things. annoyingly, the interviewer did not pursue this fascinating line of inquiry. dismayed by rainfall, he left pebble head standing alone on the steps of the bordello, tucked his notebook into an inner pocket, gave his pencil to a vagrant and ducked into the shelter of a railway station, descending the escalator to catch a train back to his office, or were more perplexing when one considers that he was working for a magazine entitled pot boilers and allotments and the social glue that binds them. In an echo of the past, the railway station into which the rain soaked reporter hurried was Waterloo, and he fell or possibly threw himself under a train from the very same platform from which Eric fog fell, or threw himself 70 years ago to the day.

Mermaids are committed members of the social justice movement. So says David toughly. Is this a blindingly obvious truth, or is it error nonsense? It has a certain radio thought a day program Thought for the Day ring to it, but actually it comes from a an online poll faced deception of Bob Dylan's Desolation Row to which the blogger Mick Hartley links. Mr. Hartley thinks that David toughly of red land by Australia is talking twaddle. But I'm not so sure. For one thing, Mr. Tough location suggests that he lives next to the sea, and that's May, from time to time have seen conversed with or otherwise had traffic with mermaids. As far as I can ascertain, Mick Hartley is a Londoner, and that is unlikely to be familiar with such semi aquatic beings. Other than those times they splash and cavort in the Thames. I did know that the government's latest equalities bill didn't have a job to say about mermaids, and this may indeed have led to a justified sense of grievance even a victimhood. But for the time being, I'm gonna reserve judgment. I plan to view footage of marches and demonstrations, seeing if I can spot any mermaids among the more common students. crusties and Beatty higher education lectures. I'll report back where my researches are at an end. But when is research ever at an end

a health tip I went to see in a fishing smack, and I dangled a net over the side and I caught among minnows and weed, a cord. Then I stood for sure. The key side I hurried to my chalet, and I slapped the cord on my tabletop and with great savagery, I gutted it with my bare hands exposing it in it. I took the liver over to the draining board, where I had ready a glass jar into the neck of which I'd stuck a funnel. I squeezed and squeezed the liver until my fist ached until every last drop of oil had dripped down the funnel into the jar. Then I threw the funnel away and took a big iron spoon, and I poured oil out of the jar onto the spoon and inserted the spoon in my mouth. And I drank the oil greedily, desperately, gurgling Lee. And that my syphilitic friends, is how I preserve my health, and why I can gamble cross the green sward with the zip and vim of a monkey. When the fancy takes me.

I'm actually individually tweeting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it, learned some important lessons about how to live your life or not. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
