Good evening This is Frank key with hooting yard. I'd like to begin this week with an apology. The apology is not actually from me. It's from Jason Hello stretchy. From the introduction to dogs stories from the spectator being anecdotes of the intelligence, reasoning, power, affection and sympathy of dogs selected from the correspondence columns of the spectator, published in 1895. And, in his introduction, Jason most straight he says. Before I conclude this introduction, I should like to address a word of apology to the correspondence of the spectator, whose letters form the present volume. Though the copyright of the letters belongs to the editors and proprietors of the spectator. I should have liked to ask the leave of the various writers before republishing their letters. Physical difficulties have however, rendered this impossible. In the case of nearly half the letters, the names and addresses have not been preserved. In many instances, again, only the names remain. Lastly, a large number of the letters are 10, or 12, or even 20 years old, and the writers may therefore be dead or out of England. Under the circumstances, I have not made any effort to enter into communication with the writers before including their letters in this book that their permission would have been given Had it been asked I do not doubt the original communication of the letters to the spectator is proof that the writers wish to public use to be made of the anecdotes they relate. As long then, as the letters are not altered, or edited, but produced verbatim. I may, I think, feel assured that I'm doing nothing, which is even remotely discourteous to the writers

should note that anyone who writes to hooting yard at hooting dot yard@gmail.com can expect the same treatment I will. I will assume that anyone who writes to me on any subject whatsoever is happy for whatever they write to be published on the hooting yard website at hooting yard without the.in the middle hooting yard.org. And I have to say I do like the idea that anyone who's wrote a letter 10 or 12, or even 20 years ago, may therefore be dead or out of England, as if these are identical states. Maybe they are who knows. Anyway, onwards with something else now. We take as our text for today's lesson, the Gospel of Matthew chapter 10. Verse 29, are not two sparrows sold for fathering and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father. Sometimes it so happens that you will go to a sparrows cellar to make purchase of a pair of sparrows, only for him to state an asking price of more than a farthing or he might charge a filing for a single Sparrow. But throw in a second Sparrow with a buy one get one free offer, in which case you will pay a filing for two sparrows, even if the one Sparrow costs of filing in itself. There again, you might find yourself being offered a free Sparrow buyer seller of say partridges or linnets, who has an unwanted stock of sparrows, and cannot wait to be rid of them, for they agreed to Eating up his grain and millet that he would rather feed to his partridges or limit. So when we ask the question as we must, are not two sparrows sold for farming? The answer is no, not always, not in all circumstances Come what may, for there may be times in places where we will will be asked to pay more or less for a pair of sparrows. And from this, we can learn much about the ways of God and man. Yes, the honest Sparrow seller will hand us to sparrows upon receipt of a filing. But not all Sparrow sellers are honest. While some Sparrow sellers are too honest, for their own good, and as with Sparrow sellers, so to those from whom we buy other birds, not just partridges and limits, but starlings and kitty wakes and seagulls. But what is the second part of the verse from Matthew chapter 10, that one of them that is the sparrows, that one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father? The first part of the verse is a question. The second part is not it states quite vehemently and unchallengeable that without your father, one of the sparrows will not fall on the ground. But which of the sparrows is it shall not fall? One of them will, and one of them will remain in the air in flight and birdie swooping until your father appears, at which point we must assume it will plunge towards the earth, just because your father has arrived. The more one studies this passage, and I have studied it for years and years, the more problems it raises. Why does one Sparrow fall on the ground without your father? And why does the other Sparrow fall on the ground when your father appears? Is your father armed with a shotgun or a catapult? Does his mere presence in juicing the tiny frail Sparrow a heart attack? And if he can have that effect on a sparrow, what other birds partridges say or linnets, or starlings or kittiwakes, or seagulls or Robbins, or Rennes, or even hummingbirds?

These are profound questions and we must dig deep to answer them. Deeper certainly, than a sparrow may need to dig to light upon a fat juicy earthworm for its morning snack. My own experience has taught me that all that digging will be as naught unless one has first found a sparrow seller to sell one a pair of sparrows for a filing. Last in this day and age more leaden than golden. Such Sparrow sellers are rare indeed, rarer even than the proverbial hen's teeth. But the hand is quite another class of bird from a sparrow, as you will know, if you have ever kept poultry, Thus saith the Lord.

There's always protests going on at the moment. The occupy protests outside some pools in London and seemingly all over the world in all these various cities. And protest reminded me of a protest from over 40 years ago, which I read about, and I'd like to read you a quotation. Mostly celebrated of all the experiment is in other worldly ways of life, with some of the Beatles, one of whom towards the end of the decade, caused great offense to many by going to bed in public with his new bride, a Japanese lady, who was variously described as a sculptress and the filmmaker, though none could remember seeing any sculpture by her, and the only film she was known to have made consisted entirely of shots of naked buttocks moving with more or less grace, away from the camera. Mr. And Mrs. john lennon then, having been married, elected to spend their honeymoon entirely in bed, a custom which was after all, not entirely original. What made their honeymoon different from most That it was spent in conditions of extreme public exposure in a suite at the Hilton Hotel Amsterdam, to which reporters, interviewers, newspaper and television photographers, and other interested parties were free to come, and in suitable cases, invited to join them in the bed, and they're celebrate with the loving couple what was supposed to be the point of the entire proceedings, to wit, a demonstration on behalf of personal and international peace. To this end, the walls of the bedroom were decorated with signs saying bed peace, hairpiece, stay in bed and grow your hair, and the peaceful to argued reasonably enough that if everyone stayed in bed occupying themselves in growing their hair, there would be no wars, to the question what would happen if most stayed in bed and grew their hair, but a few of them more ruthless declined to do so. They had clearly not addressed themselves. For the philosophy behind the performance was summed up by Mr. Lennon, who said that all would be well if the Vietnamese both North and South would only take their trousers off, followed by the Arabs, the Israelis, the Russians and the Americans. Well, Mrs. Lenin unwittingly touched upon the fallacy in the argument by proclaiming that their mood could be summed up in the words, remove your pants before resorting to violence. It might of course be objected that this is the spirit which in practice presumably guides every rapist, but granting them this is Lenin meant to say that he who removes his pants will be unable to resort to violence, it still left unresolved the problem of what to do about those whose pants stayed resolutely on, and still more of a problem of how to deal with those who had learned to do violence while naked from the waist down or up, or even both. And that's from that's from Ben Bernard Levin's book, the pendulum years Britain in the 60s, which was published in 1970. So a kind of instant assessment of the decade just gone, and very good at is to elsewhere in one of his newspaper columns. Bernard Levin said memorably of john lennon, there's nothing wrong with him that could not be cured by standing him upside down, and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls out. I should just add, that in future, we should always refer to Bernard 11. As Bernard massive, unflagging moral, exquisitely shaped, enormously vital, enormously funny, strong, supple, human, ripe, generous and graceful, loving. And if you want to know why, you probably need to go and read the hooting yard website, or the dabbler which I write a column for drew on Fridays. If you put Diabla plus Bernard Levin into Google, you might find that quote, or the reason why you need to refer to burn 11 that way, I'm gonna stop babbling now. And we'll have a little bit of the Caucasian lullaby while I

the text of today's lesson is taken from fingers by oz. Well, Blake's done, chapter four, paragraph 16. He glanced at So Richard Dickie, in fear that the bird might have changed into a charging ostrich of fire. Excuse me, he glanced at Richard Dickie, in fear that the bird might have changed into a charging ostrich of fire. How common is it that behind our backs when we're not looking a caged bird, such as a budgerigar, or a canary turns into a charging ostrich of fire in all honesty, the army must be very rarely or I have never known such a thing to happen in all my days. For one thing, those who know their ornithology will know that the ostrich is a much larger bird than either the budgerigar, or the canary, and would not fit into the average domestic birdcage, that if by magic, some comparatively tiny caged bird transformed itself into an ostrich, it would do itself and this truth, break some bones and possibly even be suffocated, as it became an ostrich confined within a cage much too small to hold it. Against this one could argue two things. If the cage was constructed from flimsy materials, it might be that the burgeoning ostrich would simply cause the bird cage to fall for bits around it as it expanded in size from budgerigar or Canary to fall ostrich or bear in mind that Blake's done specifically describes an ostrich of fire would not be inflamed and blazing bird burn the cage to cinders as it underwent its transformation. Thus, however unlikely the event we must concede its possibility, but what would cause an ostrich to burst into flame. If anything, such a fate is more likely to visit a canary. For once upon a time, canaries in their thousands perched in cages hung from the rafters of coal mines to act as detectors of noxious fumes and gases. If the miners did not notice that a canary had choked on escaping gas, and toppled from its perch, or indeed, even if they did notice, an explosion might occur in the mind and the canary be consumed by fire. ostriches, being so much bigger than canaries, would prove an impediment to miners down a pit. So one cannot imagine them facing the same awful fiery death as the tiny birds. But then consider the ostrich is notorious tendency to swallow the most unlikely of materials. One 20th century ostrich, for example, was found to have ingested a lace handkerchief, a button the glove, a length of rope, a plain handkerchief, probably a man's assorted copper coins, metal tacks, staples and hooks, and a four inch nail. With that kind of diet, one can well imagine the addition of combustible items and an agency of combustion. So we see too, that the idea of an ostrich of fire is not so far fetched as fridge charging, that would be a perfectly instinctual reaction to a bird finding itself a flame, whether it would find a pond or lake in which to douse and extinguish the flames and the kind of domestic parlour in which all's well Blackstone's cage birds or Richard Dickie find itself is another matter entirely. Though I suppose one can imagine it charging out of the parlor and into the kitchen, towards the kitchen sink, or up the staircase and into the bathroom towards the bath. Then it would have to hope that the kitchen sink or the bath were full of standing water, for I'm not sure ostriches, which are reportedly particularly stupid birds would have the wherewithal to insert the plug into the plug hole and turn on the taps with their talents. Thus, we can see that having resolved some of the difficulties posed by the passage, were not wholly in the clear, there remain insoluble problems, as perhaps in life there ever will be. Let us now sing a hymn

that in a previous life, perhaps I was a sort of country Vicar or something, delivering sermons to the faithful in the little village church. Anyway, talking of men of the cloth, I thought for no reason whatsoever. I thought it was time we enjoyed once again. Dance critic Wilma Saul's burries report of the crumpled Jesuit father Bob and his magnificent performance as she reported, as Wilma saulsbury reported in the Plain Dealer in July 1999. I think this is a splendid review because you can picture exactly what she sat through and wished that you two had been there. As an introduction to the Jesuit priests choreography, con all performed, overwhelmed and expressionistic evocation of a dark emotional state that suggested sacred dance only in a few gestures of prayer sector a recording of prepared piano music by john cage. The brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying in a heap as the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Khan had disappeared and verbeeck had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the floor, he cried out to God ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded his fist against the real wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed in lyrical movements by 10 dancers who had learned the graceful choreography in each workshop.

I should point out that on the hooting yard website, which of course you're familiar with, you can see a photograph of father Bob of putting his dance students through their paces. Unfortunately, there isn't a photograph of him taking part in overwhelmed and hammering his fists on the wall and crying to God. Although at least not a photo of that, that I've been able to find. You'll also be able to see a photograph of the ostriches of the contents of the ostrich his stomach, in my previous piece, the Sermon on the charging ostrich of fire. The part about the contents of an ostrich his stomach is based entirely on a genuine 20th century photograph of the content of an ostrich or stomach. So you can go and see pictures of both of those things at hooting yard. And while you're there, you can buy some books. You can read many things, look at many pictures. And don't forget you can always send me some money I often make that play on this program and I'm doing so now. You know, handy to remind you every now and then. In an antique shop, I did that over the purchase of a bosoms wig. It had been pounded once with talc or something like it white, so white, and flex still clung to the horsehair. At least I think it was horsehair. It was known to be the wig of a boson because as if it were a great work of art rather than a topper for a bosoms paid, there was a card of provenance, one could follow the ownership of the wig through three centuries. Think of that. I'm no chemist, but I wondered if the wig was subjected to test whether one would discover flex not only of talc, but of sea salt, and other briny particulars. They say that in those days for hard tax ships biscuits fed to the crew was sometimes rife with weevils, perhaps within the strands of horsehair, like hidden weevils, eggs and crumbs of ships biscuit to if I may purchase what I feel compelled to take the Bolton's week to a chemist for tests, and would the chemist comply? The only chemist I know is born as a coat. He might inveigle me to let him keep the bosoms wig, and have it disinfected we borax, and then wear it on his chemists noggin. Winter is approaching after all, and his head must get a chillier such a season. He's not a hat owning man, as he's told me more than once in the smoking room and then his lab where we sit the two of us puffing on fags and talking of everything but chemistry. His eyes are those of a Moonstruck cough, and I cannot imagine what he took cast them upon me and please to keep the bosoms wig that I could ever refuse him. I'm not made that way. That's my dithering in the antique shop. If I bought the bosoms wig, I would want it for the wooden head so smoothly carved that I keep upon my caco vandrie cabinet that the wooden head has been tested. I know it to be free of woodworm and other tiny creeping things that would match it to ruination the cabinet itself I'm not so sure about in the night it creaks in the night. And also in the day, I Creek to repeatedly jarringly for I am ancient, like Methuselah.

That's almost all we have time for on hooting yard this week. Before I go, I must remind you that in a week's time, or just over a week's time a week in a day, on Friday, the 18th of November. You really mustn't miss the hooting yard live experience properly entitled an evening of lagoo breus music and lopsided prose. I will be babbling prose and outer Spaceman will be playing music company on his ukulele singing songs and we'll be appearing at Wolfson and Thai bookshop cafe gallery, which is at 12 Bermondsey square London, S e one. Basically, if you find yourself on Tower Bridge, walk south, and after about five or 10 minutes, depending on your rate of walking, you'll find it so it's seven o'clock start I think it's a fairly prompt start at seven o'clock start walks in and tie an evening of dubious music and lopsided prose costs five pounds. And if you want to book a place, just in case it's sold out, go to rather go to hooting yard and look for it there. Or go to Wolfson untamed.com. and book your place. that's really about it for this week. But I'll leave you with a quote from Stanley Baldwin. My inside is a mess of cold rumbling fluidity. My brain is costed faced is dying. Hope is dead. Not really that was just Stanley Baldwin in a rather glum mood. I'll be back next week on an evening of the goobers music and lopsided prose Eve as it's officially called. So have a nice time in the meantime, and I'll write some more stuff, which I'll read to you next week. Bye bye
