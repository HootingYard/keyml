Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. I was listening to I shouldn't really confess this, but I was listening to a different radio station earlier today. And there was a government minister being interviewed and I kept going on about things being robust and transparent. And I thought, yes, hooting yard needs to be more robust and transparent. So I'll hope and let's hope that we have some robust transparency here. This is a cowboy story. Bristow Cuddy and I were out on the trail. It pleased me that the Shanks and withers of my horse were clearly superior to those of my companions, horses, were we to gallop to a Gulch. I felt sure that I would get there first. But we were in no hurry. I was the only one with a working knowledge of the importance of vitamins. So I was in charge of our picnic arrangements as usual. My plan was for us to travel down at sunset further up the trail once we'd pass benzi poplars. There ain't no poplars at benzi, just scrub and tumbleweed, but the places sainted to the memory of Gerard Manley Hopkins. So that's why the folk there Call it what they do. A lot of those folks are monks who spend their days grunting over illuminated manuscripts in the scriptorium. But there's a fair smattering of cowpokes and Wranglers and ornery cat's mouth though babies too. You'd need some kind of VAT I make them to keep track of all the shenanigans they get up to, and that includes the monks. Briscoe was originally from Finland. His real name had lots of double eyes and double K's in it. It was too much of a mouthful, so he was known as Bristow. Back in Helsinki or Helsing falls. He had a wife named Theodora who wallowed in a swamp of moral turpitude. She had a way of tilting her head at a particular angle that drove Bristow, hobgoblin crazy, and that was why he left Finnish shores and was beside me now on his horse heading along the trail. He was so dazed brain that he thought he knew more about vitamins than I did, but I had him down as a corn ponent buckwheat kind of man, and I was really wrong. I've been wrong about Cuddy. True enough. caddy was a talented countertenor, who'd sang a few hours in his time back east. But then he got infected tonsils and suffered all sorts of disasters. He lost an eye and some of his bones and could no longer pay the rent on his flat path room. So he hitched a ride on the big old golden rail road and fetched up on the prairie with nothing but a pair of spurs and a bottle of mouthwash. His hair was yellow, and he had gruesome personal habits, but I gave him a horse and let him ride with me. Sometimes a man needs a helping hand. Carry sang as we rode along the trail of Mama, he's saying, what color will the lights be? Will light turn blue on me? It was a song that wacko Jimmy Osterberg would record on the phonograph years down the line. But even with his ravaged tonsils, I always preferred Cuddy's take on it. You could tell he'd once wow the Pluto crapped at the Opera House, but those days were gone, and Cuddy knew it. Maybe that's why he never bothered polishing his spurs. My Spurs were glistening. I had the made specially from pewter by a pewter sperm maker back in Choctaw country. They were fastened to the heels of my bingle boots. The bingle company makes the sturdy is boots you're ever likely to wear. And I know I'm gonna die with my bingle boots on. They're advertised as the boots of destiny. And even if you have no idea what your destiny will be, they're the boots your will be shot in when you meet it. It was hot on the trail. We came to a place where to one side of us was a swarm of flies and so the other side was a swarm of bees. Cuddy stopped singing took from his holster his self loading repeater, Chabrol, Truffaut Rivette, and shot them all dead, one by one.

The Mormons have a homemade hooch called leopard sweat. You can look that up if you don't believe me. I'm no kind of Saint, let alone a latter day one. But I had a flask of the firewater in my Pichet for which was a gift from a Mormon prophet we'd met yesterday. He was out in what he called the wilderness. And I got himself hopelessly entangled in a thornbush Bristow and Cuddy wanted to rob him and taught him with rattlesnakes, but I advised mercy and I was listened to. So we rescued him from the thicket and got a flask full of leopard sweat as a result. I was damned if I was going to share it with my company arrows. They could make do with their own spit. The PICHETTE by the way, was a delicately embroidered reticule made for me by a good time girl name of mod from old mar purgatives who house back in vinegar Ville. This mod had a way of tilting her head of a particular angle that reminded Bristow of his Helsinki Theodora. So we got out of there quick before he got the creepers. I was keeping a close eye on him and sometimes to eyes through binoculars. If he strayed too far ahead, or Dally too far behind bristows horse suffered from sleep apnea and hysterics, and he sat askew on his saddle, so that was causing us no end of problems. We were still hours away from benzi poplars when the trial was blocked by an in comprehensible and gigantic and hard and rectangular and monolithic slab of pure black iron. It was so huge that we were in golf in its shadow long before we reached it. bristows horse shook with terror and Covey's horse went all wobbly. My own horse with its superior withers and Shanks trotted bravely towards the slab, but it was obvious there was no way to pass it. I tapped at the metal with a tuning fork and out rang a tone at once sweet and sinister. I thought the sound might prompt Cuddy to sing again. But he was busy chewing a prune. faithfully but of necessity, we left the trail detouring off into unknown country and hoping to rejoin it beyond stovepipe hat Gulch. Before we got that far, though, we came to a cluster of ruined and rotting shacks. The horses were thirsty, so we dismounted and took them to a bumbling rivulet. As we did so, a group of people emerge from the shacks. There were men, women and children, all of them slobbering inbred halfwits, and all of them armed with mannlicher carcano rifles. This you will recall was the cheap mailorder firearm later to be used by Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot President Kennedy in November 63. I could see cutting reaching phase gun so I stopped him on the draw, knocking him to the ground. I wanted if I could to avoid a shootout. The leader of the slobbering, inbred half Wits came towards me. his stride was uncertain and spamming and as he got closer, I saw that his eyes were milky and sightless. Then he tilted his head at a particular angle, and behind me, Bristow let out a horrible scream. I turned and saw that he was aiming his bounce back at the half word, but it was shaking too much to be able to make a steady shot. I ran back and not the revolver from his poor. If you read the literature you will find that cowboys often found themselves in predicaments. Such predicaments may differ in circumstance and detail from those you face in your everyday contemporary lives. But you're still able to place yourselves through an imaginative leap in predicament distant in time and place. So let's briefly exchange places you and I I'll leave you with Bristow and Cuddy, the one during the memory of his Theodora and the other unconscious while you were set upon by armed and slobbering in red halfwits in a hot and hostile desert landscape far away from the trail. And I shall sit on a bendy bus slewing through rainy windswept streets bearing me God knows where and God knows why.

I've been watching a very exciting bee cam live on the interweb I think it comes from the the Natural History Museum. It's a live bee cam and here is my logbook from yesterday. 5:15am leap out of bed and plump myself in front of the bee cam become enthralled. 7:24am considerably basic needs such as washing and dressing and eating a hearty breakfast of kedgeree and bloaters and smokers Pop Tarts, but I'm so overwhelmed by the B cam that I postpone any activity 11:45am be haunted. Three o'clock pm, numb to the human world beginning to think like a bee making occasional buzzing noises 3:14pm nip away from the bee cam momentarily to Don it yellow and black striped leotard and black hat with antenna 7:25pm recall that I plan to write something for the hooting yard web page and to transfixed by the B cam to move 11:35pm realize that I have spent the entire day observing either bees or the absence of bees on the became suffused with a warm glow of beingness continue to watch bees with now bleary eyes make a mental note to explain to listeners that bleary eyed has nothing to do with terrifying diminutive MP Hazel Blears. 1:07am drag myself reluctantly from B cam to bed. As I fall asleep reflect upon the fact that I've never had so be centered a day as the day just gone, resolved to be even more be minded in future. And as a result of my immersion in the became I wish to announce that henceforth I will be following the path of pollen. As you may already know this path is an important and ancient tradition of be shaman ism. Look up Naomi Lewis on the web. Like her I will be bouncing out of bed at dawn and doing the lameness static walk. It looks like walking in a figure of eight when bees come back from foraging. They do this to tell a hive where the best nectar is and so on. The walk is seen to give one access to infinite knowledge and vitality. You might wonder what precisely is implied by that, and so long as if there's some kind of fluffy vagueness about the path of Poland. But I can assure you this is not so I'm confident that as infinite knowledge and vitality begin to serve us every last kink of hooting yd you as listeners will be thankful that be shaman ism is being practiced here. And you may indeed take up lameness katic walking yourselves. Incidentally, I've been asked a number of times over the years if used van dongle BRAC the suburban shaman was in fact a suburban be shaman. But I'm afraid that my researchers to date have thrown me a very pale light on the matter. While some authorities claim that he shed bits of beeswax as he roamed his shame, manic suburb. Others counter that they were simply bits of earwax falling from his admittedly rather grubby head. I do not yet know enough to pronounce on the question four. I've only been following the path of pollen since this morning. And so my knowledge is not yet infinite. I'm hoping it will be so by about Thursday week.

I know that many listeners are fans particularly of the heroic infant, tiny Enid. And so this is the first tiny Enid story that ever appeared in hooting yd tiny Enid knew all there was to know about the capture of ostriches. As we sat together gulping down tumblers of lukewarm tap water she gave me some tips. Here are some precautions she said. avoid excessive exertion and rough handling during capture. Otherwise, sudden death or permanent collapse will occur as a result of muscle damage. Or structures that go down as a result of capture stress usually die of secondary problems such as pneumonia or renal failure. It is imperative that stress factors be minimized. Capture only at low ambient temperature around 28 degrees centigrade. Prevent over exertion and minimize handling of the captured Birds when attempting to capture ostriches in camps or in small enclosures, be very careful not to herd the ostriches into the fence. The fence can be used as a guide to steer the bird into a capture Boma, but not as a net. broken legs and lacerations are the usual outcome of a poorly planned ostrich capture operation ensure that iron standards and fallen trees are not in the path of the running birds. Once an ostrich is caught, always be aware that the powerful legs are effectively used for defense. The bird will try to disavow or at least maintain its captors. Stay away from the front of the bird unless you have control of the head with the neck held at full extension and lower than the bird back. Those are very useful hints tiny Enid, I said, and I was grateful to have heard them for who knew when I might be sent out to capture an ostrich. I haven't finished Lancelot. She said my name isn't Lancelot. But tiny Enid have for many years had a fixation upon the act of Lance Percival and the symptoms of her mania cropped up in unexpected ways. I made a snap decision not to contradict her, for she had been known to throw fits and dribble when confused, and I hated having to mop up anybody's dribble, let alone tiny he needs Go on, I said for mass capture of ostriches in a large camp or in the wild, she continued, the use of the plastic capture Boma is very successful. Young ostriches up to two years of age are often found in large groups called crashes. These crash units can number up to 60 birds. Due to their strong herding instinct. These units can easily be manipulated and chased into a capture Boma using a helicopter. Once the ostriches are in the Boma, they should be allowed to rest for at least an hour before they are loaded. Excited and hot birds tend to panic when loaded immediately into mass crates and will pile on top of each other and trample each other. The use of a shield to force the birds gently forward and up the ramp will minimize injuries of the birds and the handlers. Larger aggressive males can sometimes be problematic. They should be placed on their own in separate crates. That sounds like a very good idea. Tiny Enid, I said as she paused for a sip of her water. across the field. We could see wild hogs careering madly into the swamp, and the faint silhouette of a water colorist sat at their easel attempting to capture the scene. When time is not a factor said tiny Enid a pop up corral set up around a watering point or a small patch of Lucerne with supplemental feeding is a useful method for the capture of ostriches. The birds are allowed to enter the capture corral on their own, and stress levels are kept to a minimum as no chasing of the birds occurs. She paused again, took a cigarillo from her pocket and asked me if I had any matches. I fumbled for my little box, but it was damp. I'm afraid my matches are damp tiny Enid I said. If you blow on them, they will eventually become dry Lancelot, she advised while you do. So here are some final points.

Never capture ostriches at high ambient temperatures. Do not handle ostriches, roughly during capture, do not chase the birds excessively during the capture procedure. Never use a net gun to capture ostriches. Never chase ostriches into a fence to capture them. Are your mattress dry yet? No, they're not I panted. In that case said tiny Enid replacing the cigarillo in her pocket. I suppose I shall have to visit the news agents. And she said the last of her water rose from her chair kissed me lightly on the forehead and walked away. years later, in a second hand shop, I found a watercolor painting of wild hogs in a swamp done in pinks and greens and pale yellows. And I bought it because I wondered if it was the painting made on that golden afternoon when I sat with tiny Enid for the very last time

More about birds now, not ostriches though. Despite having tiny pea sized brains birds may be more intelligent than we thought. avian scientists have been studying crows, which are apparently able to carry out tasks involving food and twigs, which would be beyond the width of a human infant. They can also make elementary tools like hooks, though why a crow with its fears lacerating talents would need a hook is beyond me. the cleverest CRO in this particular study, incidentally was called Betty, which seems an unusual name for a CRO. If I had a pet CRO, which I do not. I'd call it something like Cecilia or hortensia. Or perhaps Clytemnestra. But Betty was a new Caledonian crow. So perhaps that's pertinent. In trying to explain why miniscule bird brains are able to wield such unexpected mental power. The scientists suggest that they may work in entirely different ways to the brains of mammals. A prized of this pansy cradle drew has suggested that I could challenge Edward de Bono and Tony Buzan as a self styled brain expert, and churn out a series of books with titles such as think like a crow. rewire your brain, the Kormoran way, and storm pet crawl thought patterns made easy and swiftly moving on. And last week, we were very lucky to have some poems by Dennis beer pint on the show. And just found rather late in the in the day, a Guy Fawkes Night poem by by Dennis beer pint, which goes like this. Remember, remember the fifth of November gunpowder treason and plot. Remember to the case of the distressed pig solved by special agent blot. The distressed pig was found in a rowing boat crossing 10 Tara beam Lake agent blot swam out to it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becomed agent blot took the oars, and he rode to the mud splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plotted his way in his Wellington boots to the pig farmers hat down the lane, and he felt the brute with a frack of his fist and bound him up with a train. Special Agent blot drag the pig farmer off to the prison, banging the center of town and that is why on November the fifth, the distressed pig did not drown

is a very rare extract from the out of print pamphleteer Dobson's private journal. So previously unpublished, dated the 27th of March 1969. For the past few weeks, I have become increasingly fixated upon the young Israeli singing duo Esther and Abby Oh firing. Yesterday I dug out a reel to reel tape recording device from a jumble of abandoned equipment in the broom cupboard and made a looping tape or tape loop I think it's called of the pair performing Lord of the Reedy River. This is my favorite of their waxwings perhaps because in my dreams, I like to think that I could one day be a lord or Tsar or Baron or potentate of a really river, a very Reedy river, a river so choked with reeds and weeds and thin stringy green flora that the water is brackish and its surface covered in scum. One imagined the smell of this river being quite unbearable, and it being shunned even by dogs. The song appears on last year's long player up to date copies of which I think I will give out as birthday and Christmas presents. Whether the recipients wanted or not. I'm toying with the idea of founding an ester and Abby affarin fan club, although I suspect one already exists. Of course, Lord of the Rings The river is only one of their great tracks. I've become convinced that if music has a future, these personable youngsters are the key to it. Another terrific thing about them is that so many anagrams can be made from Esther and Abby Oh farin including fat horse brain media. Mashed airborn fat bear firm Oh Satan, die Moyers refined a bath? Oh, train beside a farm. Bob's in fire at a home for Santa Barbara is mine. hamster foe in bad air and a basin of mired Earth. I think that last one would make a great title for their next album. So if I can find out how to contact them. I'm going to write and suggested I suppose I ought to mention here that marigold Chu says their music is driving her crackers and she has decamped to a seaside resort, even though it is March and the weather is exceedingly inclement. She has not even told me to which confounded, pebbly shore she has gone so I am quite bereft and only the dulcet tones of Esther and Abby Oh, foreign singing Lord of the Reedy river, and indeed Sani kakuzu gala purple eyes and act Varma land do schooner a keeping me from flinging myself off a parapet as my grandfather died when he could no longer cope with his aversion to breakfast cereals. A tragic episode, told him fall in my pamphlet, cornflakes, ready break Special K and suicide, which I'm sad to note is now out of print.

I'd like to end this week's show, as as often with some quotes from other writers. Well known writers this week actually, not not obscure people, beginning with Emanuel swedenborg. From the delights of wisdom pertaining to conjugal love. When I was desert is to delight my mind animus According to my Idea of heavenly blessedness a southern stupor occasioned by the light of heaven, which is as white as snow, and whose essence is said to be wisdom, seized my mind, men's and darkness, my eyes, and I was reduced to a state of insanity. And presently, from the heat of heaven, which corresponds with the brightness of its light, and whose essence is said to be love, there arose in my heart of violent palpitation. A general uneasiness seized my whole frame, and I was inwardly excruciating to such a degree that I threw myself flat on the ground. And it may be that swedenborg threw himself onto the ground while on a road or by the side of a road, which makes the next quote, perhaps more personal than otherwise might be. This is from Arnold Bennett, who wrote in literary taste, how to form it. To my mind, one of the most beautiful words in the English language is pavement, enunciation, enunciated study it sound and see what you think. So there's something for you to do after listening to hitting yard, and not Say the word pavement, study it and see if you think with along with Arnold Bennett, that it's one of the most beautiful words in the English language, pavement. I won't be here next week, and so probably play a repeat, but I'll be back in two weeks with more stuff, prose, quotations, and Dennis beer pint poems. Bye bye
