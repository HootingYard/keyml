That was pull the plug with parrot and paperback. This is Frank key and paperback. This is a sample of me talking followed by the sound of a paperback falling on the floor. Which do you prefer parrot and paperback or Frank key and paperback, you decide. But enough of that, my name is Frankie, this is hooting out on the air. And I'm going to read to you for 28 or 2028 27 minutes or so. And I'm going to begin this week, more or less where I left off last week around by popular demand, which I've just made up because no one has contacted me at all.

The other day, I met a man who claimed he could eat his own head. I consider this preposterous and said so we were at a sophisticated cocktail party and he was leaning insouciantly against a mantel piece. I can prove it to you. He said, as a demonstration, I will eat your head and that will show that I could eat my own. I thought about this for perhaps three seconds before responding. your so called proof has several distinct flaws. I said. First, that if you eat my head, I will be in no position to form a judgment on the success or otherwise of your antics. As I presume I will lose consciousness and die as you know through my neck, thus severing all important nerves and arteries and whatnot that enable my brain to function. Second, your ability to eat my head has no bearing whatsoever on your claim to be able to eat your own head. It's an entirely different

head.

Frank Key  05:20
He took a sip of his cocktail before conceding. Those are both valid points. But there were but two, and you said you had several. Let those two suffice for the time being I said, very well, he replied, I can see that I'm up against a skeptic of formidable mental acuity, you're not by any chance a Jesuit are you? I assured him I was not, despite it having been a childhood ambition to be ordained into that order. I too, once dreamed of becoming a Jesuit, he said, but alas, I lost my faith. Still, that was a long time ago, since when I suppose I learned to replace it with the more fervent belief that I can eat my own head. You won't be satisfied until I you until you actually witness me and the act of doing so will you? I nodded my agreement. He looked at me in silence. And after a pause, said, there, there what I asked. I just ate my own head and regurgitated it as a bird does with food read young, he said, You must excuse my manners. For I'm a terribly fast eater and tend to gobble my food. I can be quite a cause of social discomfort. You're in the better restaurants. I witnessed neither eating nor regurgitation. I said, you just stood there looking at me. He sighed with a measure of impatience. I have just explained to you that I eat with regrettable speed, he said. And this habit has a deleterious effect on my digestive system. One consequence of which is that I cannot tolerate certain foodstuffs, including human flesh and bone and brain matter, etc. So I spew them up immediately. You are a very foolish man. Good evening to you, sir, I said, and I turned on my heel and wandered off across the room, away from the mantle piece in search of somebody else to talk to. Later that evening, passing near the mantle piece again, I saw the man biting the head of another party guest, a person who I reasoned, had not had the benefit of a Jesuit critical education, and thus could not counter the arguments of this foolish but persuasive fellow. There was blood on the carpet, as they so often is, even at the most sophisticated of cocktail parties.

I had a wife yearns to walk in the shoes of the fisherman. First I had to persuade the fisherman to give me his shoes, or at least to lend them to me. But he was a surly and cantankerous fellow, as fishermen often are, especially when trafficking with landlubbers. And I certainly loved to the land. In fact, it was precisely my loving of the land that made me long to walk in the shoes of the fisherman. I reasoned acutely, I think that wearing a fisherman shoes while walking about pairing up birds, I could broaden my land bound lab by a tuning myself to the denizens of the deep fish, and those whose domain was the sky birds. It might be argued that simply wearing a fisherman shoes was no match for plunging into the briny depths and swimming about with all those Mariann beefin creatures below. But I'm a cautious man, and I did not wish to run before I could walk as it were, though, that's possibly not the best analogy to make. It has been my experience that most people are open to bribery by herring, but this ploy would obviously not work with a fisherman. By following him about for several weeks and closely questioning his local kiosk owner, I discovered that the fisherman had an unquenchable thirst for squelch. Using my underworld contact, I was able to obtain half a dozen bump a multi packs of the canned fizzy drink. And one morning shortly after he had returned from a night fishing expedition. I loaded the cans onto a cart and trundle it down to the foul and reeking Wharf where I knew the fishermen liked to warm up about. He proved to be a very canny fisherman and drive a hard bargain, but eventually agreed to let me borrow his shoes until midday, on the understanding that I would then bring him a further half dozen multipacks of sculpture. I had no intention of submitting to Santa extortion, but nodded agreement. I would worry about the consequences of reneging on the deal later. For your edification, I wanted to reproduce a verbatim transcript of our exchange at this point. Unfortunately, the tape I made on a cassette recorder concealed in my bomber jacket was wiped Later that morning, when I was engulfed in a terrific electrical storm. See below. And so I set out to walk in the shoes of the fishermen and to look at birds in the sky. I have not counted on the happenstance that the fisherman's feet were several sizes smaller than mine. Walking in his shoes was an agony. But I persevered repeating my mantra. I am not a milk stop. I am not a milk stop. I am not a milk sob. I walked in the shoes of the fishermen away from the wharf and oversold us bridge and along Yoko Ono Boulevard and pass the important roadworks the ballistol mind bypass and through the acre of mud and along the perimeter fence of POC haven aerodrome and under the viaduct up up into the blue forgotten hills. All the while, I was keenly watching the skies and I saw several birds. The first was about 5.7 inches long, with a wingspan of roughly 9.6 to 11.2 inches and a weight somewhere between 8.6 and naught point six three and 1.02 ounces. It had a black forehead and a blue gray crown night and upper mantle. The rump was alight olive green and the lower mantle and scapulars from the brown saddle. The side of the head, throat and breast were a doll rust red merging to a pale creamy pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers were dark gray with a black shaft streak. The rest of the tail was black apart from the two outer feathers on each side which had White wedges. each wing had a contrasting white panel on the coverts and a bath wide bar on the secondaries and in a primaries.

Frank Key  15:12
The flight feathers were black with white on the base of the portions of the veins. The second reason in a primaries had pale yellow fringes on the outer web, whereas the outer primaries had a white outer edge. My own or theological education had been brought to a premature end because of the war. But I knew a limit when I saw one. I jotted down linnet in my bird book, together with a note of the date and the weather. And the fact that I could barely think straight due to the stabbing pains in my feet, showed in the fisherman shoes. I tucked the bird book back into my pocket, and I screamed, I am not a milk sob several times at the top of my voice. Shortly afterwards, I had to take the bird book out again because I spotted a second bird. This one was a larger than a European Robin, and it had a white rump and tail with a black inverted t pattern at the end of the tail. It's plumage, plumage, had gray upperparts bath throat and black wings and a face mask. It had a whistling crackly song, and it's called was a typical Chat Chat noise, just the same as its flight call. cursing the war that paid to my avian studies, I wrote bunting in my bird book and added a brief pen portrayed of the fisherman who shoes I was walking in with increasing difficulty and much anguish.

Frank Key  16:55
The third bird I saw that day up in the sky above the blue forgotten hills was about seven inches long, weighed roughly 1.1 to 1.4 ounces and displayed a light green body color, abdomen and rumps while it's mantle's back and wing coverts displayed pitch black mantle markings edged in clear yellow undulations. The forehead and face were yellow with blackish stripes down to the sear. It displays displayed small purple treat patches and a series of three black spots across each side of its throat, called throat spots. The two outermost throat spot was situated at the base of each cheek patch. The tail was cobalt, dark blue, and outside tail feathers displayed central yellow flashes. its wings had greenish black flight feathers and black coverts with yellow fringes along with central yellow flashes. Its build was always gray and its legs. bluish gray with zygo dactyl toes. I scribbled down night jar in my bird book and collapsed to the ground memories of bombs and artillery fire in my head and excruciating spasms of agony surging through my feet. I took off the shoes of the fisherman and made my way back to the wharf in my socks. The fisherman was sitting on an upturn barrel surrounded by drained and crushed well Joe cans. As I approached him swinging his shoes by their laces. I realized I had not yet thought of a stratagem to avoid having to pay him off with another half dozen bump a multi packs of his favorite fizzy drink. But as things turned out, I did not have to, for all of a sudden, we were engulfed in a terrific electrical storm. See above. I escaped unscathed, probably due to the stylish Li conical gutta percha hat atop my head. But my cassette tape was wiped and the fisherman was struck by lightning several times and quaking like a jelly toppled off his barrel and over the edge of the wharf and into the sloshing sea, into which he sank remorselessly emitting squelchy sparks remorselessly I tossed the shoes into the water. They were no good to me being far too small. But I had walked in the shoes of the fishermen observing birds in the sky. So I had succeeded in realizing one of my greatest ambitions, a lot of land. I had communed simultaneously with creatures of sea and sky. I knew later back at home, go From a can of squelch oh and browsing in an illustrated treatise upon birds did I learn that I had seen neither a lunate nor a bunting nor a night jar. The birds I had spotted were a traffic and a wheat here and a budgerigar. Clearly there was only one thing to do. I would have to fish the shoes of the fishermen out of the wharf side water and cram my feet back into them and go walking again away from the wharf and oversold us bridge and along Yoko Ono Boulevard and pass the important roadworks at the Bristol mind bypass on through the acre of mud and along the perimeter fence of pox haven aerodrome and under the viaduct, and up up up into the blue forgotten hills, looking at birds in the sky, this time writing their proper names in my bird book, all the while walking in the shoes of the fisherman

Speaking of fishmonger's, as I was sort of a little while ago, fishermen fishmonger's similar reminded me of a piece I wrote seven years ago in 2008. And it was prompted by Reiner happens stalls observation that in one of his poets sorry, then in one of his pines, TS Eliot, so oddly bids us to pray for fishmongers. Oh, Lord, through that infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and place is the opening couplet of the fishmongers prayer. This has the distinction of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is why you will rarely hear it recited in full length is due to the fact that within the rolling cadences of it's many, many, many versus all known types of fish, both edible and inedible, and mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial monomaniac named egg but Bach he was not himself a practicing fishmonger, nor indeed did he live in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little man whose ears were perplexingly shaped it as much as they looked as if they had been stuck to his head upside down. his obsession with fish is thought to have been caused by a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders nine times out of Such a happenstance will lead to a phobia. But in eggbutt box case it had precisely the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon his brain after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted to fish and the mongering of fish were terrifically shriveled. Some seaside vicars still include an abridged version of the fishmongers prayer in their services. But not many.

And that my lovelies is I think almost the end of hating yard. I wonder if we've got time for just one last bit of one last bit of Norman Davis. For the for this week. Do we have time we have oh we have time. Okay. Then let's have something on bird greenness age table. One, that while we oldest living birds are the long tailed long migration swallows and turns etc. sleek fast with some of the largest birds to these are followed by short factor ducks and crows heavy rough, tough, slow, medium sized land water. Three, ven COMM The thrushes static territorial, followed by the day night birds of prey predators for then geese, followed by CD's ng finishes and htet and elegant doves and wagtails. Five tree birds have brief alized woodpeckers tree creepers not hatch flycatchers tippetts redstarts, great tid, bulfinch, Kingfisher, etc. Six, with the least long living being the smallest, Rennes and gold crest, etc. And then that's your lot for this week. I'll read some more Norman Davis and some more of my own stuff next week. Until then, have a final time and just let's have a little little repeat of a paperback book falling to the floor or desk was a sample. Bye bye.
