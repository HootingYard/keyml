Good evening, welcome to resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. It's the new season of hooting out on the air, which will probably be uncannily similar to if not identical to all the previous seasons of hooting yard over the past 10 and a half years. For those of you new to the show, if there are any new listeners, what happens is that I am I read out sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose for about half an hour, interspersed now and then with our theme tune, which you just heard, which is the Caucasian lullaby by slap happy and Henry cow from the 1975 album, desperate straits. And that's about it. Really, that's all what really happens on this show. Occasionally, I might direct you to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org where you can read all the stuff that I read by yourself if you wish. And you're also there when you were there, I usually try to beg people to donate to the pooting yard fund for distressed out of print pamphleteers. So you can do that too, if you wish. But so that's what to expect on hooting yard. And we'll begin this new season with a story called Captain knitties. Lung collapse is that wasn't very well done was it? I have to read that again. Captain knitties lung collapses. One grim bright morning, Captain nitti was walking along and imposing an expansive Boulevard when one of his lungs collapsed. he gasped before crumpling in an untidy Angular heap upon the paving slabs. As he fell, his capitani cap fell off his head and landing on its brim rolled into the gutter, where it was worried by a stray dog. The dog had strayed from its owner, who was known to Captain nitti. Though the dog was not. Captain nitti had what is known as dog blindness, in that he could never perceive any dog with any of his five senses. So even had he had his wits about him. Rather than being sprawled gasping on the pavement, he would not have been aware of the dog knowing and pulling his cap. Later, in a bed on a ward in the clinic to where he had been ferried by a rickety and inefficient ambulance. Captain this he asked the clinic chaplain who was sitting at his bedside, telling the seven last words from the cross on his rosary beads, where his cap was. The trapline replied in Latin language with which Captain nitti was unfamiliar. What the chaplain said was, Do not interrupt me with questions about your cap, when I am praying for the salvation of your immortal soul through the words of Christ in His last extremity. Meanwhile, the dog had carried the cap in its mouth, away from the boulevard to a pack of gauze and scrub over by the viaduct. Here, it lost interest in the cap and deposited it in a puzzle. Then it scampered off to frighten some tiny tots gathered around the spooky fathomless inky black pond. Captain nitti made a miraculous recovery and that very excuse me, Captain nitti made a miraculous recovery. And that very same day at around tea time was back on his feet. He discharged himself from the clinic and went in search of his cap. does it bring tears to your eyes, the thought of him bareheaded and desperate looking in all the wrong places plagued by invisible dogs die off the grim, bright day. fruitlessly, fruitlessly, fruitlessly. It should.

Captain nifi like a saint in a medieval painting, Captain Mitty bought an attribute. St. Clement, for example, is usually shown with an anchor, St. JOHN chrysostom. With B's st Dunstan with a hammer and tongs and st vest with a wolf carrying a goose in its mouth. Captain nitti was often to be seen with a handful of breadcrumbs. There are several photographs of Captain nity taken by the pointy town High Street snapper f x duggleby in all, but one of which is attribute or emblem is present and correct. Captain nitti holdout is open palm, piled with breadcrumbs as if proffering them to the viewer. The exception is a picture of Captain nitti. Pretending to fly. He is wearing a pair of wings made of corrugated cardboard, satin and Tat, and gazing into the middle distance with a look of startling stupidity. The trains with which he is attached to the ceiling of Fx duggleby Studio, are clearly visible, despite the photographer's efforts to bleach them out. With bleak there are two different stories given as the origin of Captain knitties traditional association with a handful of breadcrumbs. The first is that our hero was regularly sent on maneuvers to a municipal Park, where insurgents bent on toppling the regime was said to use the flower beds with their dazzling splurges of lupins and hollyhocks, with places of concealment. and thence the flower beds was a pond in which teal mergansers pin tails and swans were rife, soft hearted, and by some accounts, soft brained, Captain nitti like to feed the ducks and swans by scattering breadcrumbs upon the surface of the waters. After the regime was toppled, he took much of the blame distracted by ducks, in the words of the official chargesheet. Unlike a saint in a medieval painting, captivity was not mastered, unless one considers a sentence of several months, potato peeling booty, a martyrdom. The other story is vastly more complicated and impossible the summarize, listeners would do better to study the seven volume novel sequence game of breadcrumbs, making notes all the while in the margins. Those of you without the patience or ability to read can instead watch the television adaptation, which is one of mantel pieces worth of awards, including the silver bobble for best swamp and the FX duggleby. Memorial pot for most innovative use of bleach.

Dear Mr. Key, writes a correspondent I have just made up. I know you are a constant reader who always has a book on the go as they say, it would interest me to know how you go about choosing which book you're going to read next. In the normal course of things I would be hard pressed to give a straightforward answer to that question. Like most of us, I suspect, I alight upon books for all manner of different reasons, not always rational. Today, however, well I wrote this, the beginning of the resonance break, so just bear with me, just pretend that it's early August. Today, however, I can say definitively that that I decided on my current reading simply because I saw a photograph in the newspaper of Michael Gove reading it. When he was sacked as the education secretary in the recent reshuffle, The Guardian had a double page spread on Michael Gove, much of which was of course devoted to attacking him. Among the accompanying photographs, was one of goverdhan Literary Festival, where he was shown reading from the title was clearly visible, the Lost World of British communism by Rafael Samuel essays written in the 1980s, but published in book form by verso in 2006. I immediately wanted to read this book and eventually got round to borrowing it from the library. And when at the time I wrote this, I'd only read a few pages. But I said it looks very promising. In the preface by Samuels widow, Alison light, I learned that among the treats in store for me were such details as and I quote, what communists sang or watched at the cinema, what they wore open neck shirts if they were men, with a pen or pencil, prominently displayed in the breast pocket. jumper, slacks and sensible shoes if they were women. How party members comported themselves in public, they were urged to be neat and clean. Where they went on holiday, if indeed they took holidays, preferring bracing walks in bleak settings, the content and feel of their homes, which were usually uncomfortable with a small shrine of books, and the garden left a wilderness for want of personal time.

bracing walks in bleak settings. That sounds like me, I must be a communist. I wonder if that's one of the questions I ask you on immigration to the United States. Are you now or have you ever been fond of bracing walks in bleak settings? anyway? I've been thinking as I sometimes do, about the ineradicable stupidity of certain animals. These thoughts were prompted by the newsagent cat. It really is a bewilderingly stupid cat. I then found myself pondering the blue footed boobie, a bird which gives the impression of being as witless as any cat. The newsagent does not have a pet boobie last. So I had to make do with examining pictures, one of which I posted on the hooting yard website. I didn't post a picture of a cat, because you already know what they look like. I then began to wonder which one is the more stupid, the cat or the booby? Surely the best way to find out would be to pit one against the other in a lack of intelligence test. A brain off between the newsagents cat and a blue footed boobie. Unfortunately, it was at this point that I learned by consulting my copy of Dobson's bumper book of facts about things the lower extremities of which are blue, out of print, that the blue footed boobie is not native to the shores. Apparently, they're to be found from the Gulf of California, down along the western coast of Central and South America, to Peru. The wonders of space age technology means Their far distant cabinet habitat need not determine. All I need is for a hooting yard listener resident in that part of the world to get hold of a blue footed boobie and stick it in front of a computer. I will do likewise with the newsagents cat, and we can link up using Skype, we can then subject them to a series of tests that one against the other cat versus boobie. To determine which one is the thickest. I will read an account of the contest and its results. As soon as we've we've managed to conduct it

having a slight technical hitch here, but while that's going on, while that while that I've just exacerbated the technical hitch now, but while we're having the technical hitch I should mention the interesting fact that Dusty Springfield, one of her favorite pastimes was ordering crates full of brand new crockery, and then taking each bit of crockery one by one out of the crate and smashing it in a wild, wild frenzy against the wall.

Frank Key  17:32
Through the miracle of being capable of solving things I've managed to solve the technical hitch, and I thought I'd tell you about the fact that I went to the greengrocers and bought a bag of weird oranges. I say bag, but it was really a net span from some kind of red synthetic fiber, fastened with a dinky metal clasp. The neck contained by my reckoning half a dozen oranges, and weird they were, though my intention had been to buy blood oranges. I was persuaded by the pattern of the greengrocer to take the weird ones instead. The curious thing about his pattern was that by the time I was a few yards along the street, clutching my neck, on my way to the park, I was unable to recall a single word of it. Why was I carrying weird oranges? Instead of the blood oranges I had wanted. I had no idea. But no did I seem able to retrace my steps. I hurried on towards the gates of the park as impelled by a force out with my perception. Arriving at the park, I made my way to my usual bench and then the duck pond. The Ducks looked forlorn and Ill tempered. I discovered that it was impossible to unfasten the clasp on the neck with my bare hands. It was, as I said, dinky about the size of say, eight standard stationery stapled impact impacted together laterally. I picked out it with my fingernails, but could get no purchase. I then tried to tear a slit in the net itself. God knows what the fibers were made of. Whatever it was resisted my increasingly energetic attempts to render it. I gave up when my fingers were red with bloody stripes, and my hands were shaking. My plan had been Oh, it hardly matters does it? Now it was so plainly abortive, in any case are reflected as I sat on the bench, panting from my exertions by plan probably would not have succeeded anyway, since I had been coaxed in Buying weird oranges instead of blood oranges, the latter being a crucial element in my plan, a tail, or it might have been a merganser paddle to the edge of the duck pond and fix me with a look of reproach. I spat on the ground and kept on spitting until I had exhausted my friend. Then I went to trudging without a more purpose. through the park and along the line passed the railway sidings up into the hills, those damn noble pointy hills. I left the net of weird oranges on the park bench, from which they were snaffled before the day's end by a wolf. It was a weird wolf. So at least there was some kind of neatness to what was otherwise a most Jamboree jumbly day.

Another thing that happened during August during the break was that my brother asked me a question, which he was in Poland at the time. And he sent me an email saying, Why are there no bananas in Poland? I posted this question on the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org and I was absolutely disgusted that not a single reader bothered to answer the question. So perhaps listeners to the hooting yard tro might be better at doing that. If you'd like to tell me why there are no bananas in Poland, you can write to me at hooting dot yard@gmail.com One of the things that again, I'm going to refer to today in this following piece for which you should read sometime early in August. Two of the answers in today's Guardian crossword we're speckled and splodge. This put me in mind of Dobson's pamphlet, a comparative study of speckles and splodges and smudges, out of print. It is one of his most exasperating works. The exaggeration lies in the words of the critic rapper ku tech in the fact that quote, Dobson opens with the grand statement that the speckle the splodge, and the smudge, each of them wholly discreet and different phenomena, and to model them up is not merely ignorance, but dangerous ignorance. wars have been fought and men have died for failure to distinguish between the three. This is exasperating on two counts, first in the 80 pages of microscopically tiny prints that follow the pamphleteer himself neglects to explain the difference between speckles and splotches and smudges. Second, nor does he provide a single example of the war and death he so melodramatically warns the reader of and I'm going to read this sentence run on because I hate to end with a preposition, even though to do so is completely defensible. Unless one is up against the most rigorous of patents on certain patents are with a hammer of correction.

Frank Key  24:19
It is perhaps worth noting that rapid Kahu tech bore several dents in his head, made by one such Hammer of correction wielded by a particularly rigorous patent, whose paths he used to cross occasionally. The Critic like to spend his mornings at a sophisticated pavement cafe, sipping from a glass of bank along the pavement would come the pendant with his hammer, lashing out with what used to be called gay abandon. The dents in his head did not affect rapid gootecks critical acumen, however, and we must agree with his judgment about this particular Dobson. pamphlet, in a sense, we have no option but to agree with him and trust him, because we're never likely to read the work itself. As he points out, the text of the pamphlet is microscopically tiny, and he's not exaggerating. It's so tiny that the average reader would ruin their eyesight. Before getting to the end of the preface and acknowledgments wrapper Kahu tech explains in an afterword so his own essay, that he was able to read all 80 pages of text, because his sense of vision was inexplicably enhanced by one of the blows to the head he received from the peasants Hammer of correction. In a further afterward to a second printing of his essay, the critic relates how a subsequent blow from the same hammer restored his sight to rich, previous mild myopia. And so, I shall never again be able to read Dobson's pamphlet on speckled and splodges and smudges, but quite frankly, why on earth would I want to it's absolute drivel. A hugely magnified copy of Dobson pamphlet has been made available by the Dobson pamphlet magnification commission. But so tiny is the text that in spite of the hugeness of the magnification, it is still pretty much illegible to any human eye.

Frank Key  27:03
It's nearly time to go. But I think before I do, I'll read you an old the text on the back of an old Victorian I think trading card for Dr. Thomas is at collect trick oil. And that's the correct pronunciation as a collector electric. Dr. Thomas is electric oil what it has done, what it will do, it will positively cure. toothache in five minutes. earache in two minutes, backache in two hours. lameness in two days, coughs in 20 minutes hoarseness in one hour. Cold in 24 hours, sore throat in 12 hours. deafness in two days, pain of burn in five minutes. School in five minutes. croup it will cease in five minutes, and positively cure any case when used at the outset. Remember that Dr. Thomas is eclectic oil is only 50 cents per bottle, and one bottle will go farther than half a dozen of an ordinary medicine. It's unlikely that any listeners to this show are deaf. But if so, get yourself a bottle of Dr. Thomas is eclectic oil. And apparently, you will definitely be cured in two days. quite a remarkable medicine that that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. If as I say I said at the outset if you're a new listener. I hope you've been well. I hope you've enjoyed it even more than the old listeners who are probably bored to the back teeth of my babbling I will be back next week. Bye bye
