Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Half an hour of inspiring prose. And I'd like to begin today with a story called jog or parafin. A curious tale attaches itself to the shortest pamphlet Dobson ever published. of a light hearted even frisky disposition, one foul winter's day, he wrote as follows. Obtain a large drug of paraffin. Remove the cap from the drug and slosh the paraffin over a pile of something dry and brittle in a public place. Toss a lighted match onto it, stand back and watch the resulting Blaze. This will warm your cockles and provide a pleasing spectacle to pass the time of day. Having nothing further to add, the pamphleteer persuaded marigold to to set these four sentences in a particularly decisive and heroic typeface and issued it under the unambiguous title found with parafin for the cover marigold true chosen mezzotint by the mezzotint test Rex tint, depicting his sister dot tint hand tinting one of his mezzotint with a paraffin based colorant. Before doing any typesetting or production work on the pamphlet, however, marigold true had a fracture has to do with Dobson over his use of the word jog. She insisted that a jog was by definition an open neck container, and that he should prefer the word canister for a canister would have a cap and be a more likely receptacle for parafin van would have drug which, though it may be fitted with a plug or a stopper would never have a cap. Dobson never took kindly to having his errors pointed out to him, believing that the sheer force of his prose, even in so shorter pamphlet is this auto silence his critics. He was fond of quoting Christopher smartline from Drew bellatti agno where the poet says, For I pray God for the ostriches of saulsbury plain, the beavers of the Medway and silverfish of Thames. Oh, sorry, sorry, wrong line. I was distracted there for a moment by a freshly laundered dish cloth flapping in the breeze. The line Dobson liked to use to defend himself against detractors was for my talent is to give an impression upon words by punching, that when the reader casts his eye upon him, he takes up the image from the mold, which I have made. marigold crew, though, was a stickler and challenged Dobson to produce in the real world rather than from the skewed universe inside his skull, a drug sealed with a cap. characteristically, the pamphleteer tried to shirk this by muttering some nonsense about his urgent need to examine a nest of stints in a shrubbery over by the pond. Why on earth he persisted in his lifelong delusion that ornithology could rescue him from any pickle he found himself in is a question for wiser heads than mine. marigold to made short shrift of his stinky babblings, of course, and Dobson was left with no choice but to head off to Huberman in the hope that somewhere on the shelves of that honorably gorgeous department store, he might pounce upon a kept jog. And therein lies the strangeness of this tale. For As he approached the plaza where who Berman's loomed enormous, he found the building and shrouded in a weird mode of mist, like the purple cloud in MP shields novel of that title, and he wandered into the mist and through the doors of who Berman's and they're in the foyer, he came upon a tottering tower of drugs, all with screw top caps, and all filled to the brim with paraffin. And it was convulsed by a desire to toss a lighted match upon them, and to pass an entertaining time watching the Blaze, just as he described in his yet to be typeset pamphlet. But as he reached in his pocket for a box of lucifers he was felled by an eagle eyed Huberman security guard, a titanic monster of a man whose epaulettes glistened in the midst and whose buttons glistened in the middle Stephen more than his epaulettes so glistened, and Dobson was kept under lock and key in a broom cupboard in the basement of the department store until bailed by an eerie, cadaverous magistrate, who wrote the land on horseback following the move missed wherever it's settled.

Home Again, fuddled, and with mysterious move stamens upon his clothing. The pamphleteer told his tale to marigold true, who, despite raising a skeptical eyebrow, skipped at once to her shed and cranked out Dobson's pamphlet with the text as Dobson wanted it, the world once again cast from the mold his words had made.

And that story, you've got a quotation or two quotations from Christopher smart. And in the story that follows. There's a quotation from john Milton from Paradise Lost. So you could say that in among all the other stuff you get with hooting Jada Keller kind of crash course in masterpieces of English poetry. This is called hectic clanging. On Tuesday morning, I was woken by the hectic clanging of the bells of some bibley babe Dibs. I had been dreaming about a monkey as big as a planet, as I sometimes do. Using the botsman technique, I squeezed the sleep out of my brain clambered out of bed and threw my windows wide open. I was rather disconcerted to note that, as Milton put it in book four of Paradise Lost the story cope of heaven, all the elements at least had gone to rack disturbed and torn for Monday had been mild with sunny intervals, and there had been no sign of cosmic Cataclysm. Indeed, I had made the point of watching Daniel Corbett's early evening weather forecast on the BBC, and that always reliable and beautifully well spoken presenter had said nothing at all about rack disturbance and a tearing in the heavens, as far as I could remember. I had, however, taken the precaution of making a copy of his forecast on my Bakelite televisual simulacra meeting device, and the steam would have dispersed overnight, making it ready for viewing. So I went into the parlor and depressed the starting knob. I was keen to see if my memory was playing tricks, for there seem to be no other explanation for the disjuncture between Daniel Corbett's prognostications and the foul reality out with my windows. While I waited for the valve to warm up, I recalled that the monkey in my dream had been about as big as the planet Mercury. In earlier dreams, it had been the size of one of those gigantic gas planets you read about. And I wonder if this shrinkage was something to be welcomed, or indeed, to be feared. It was hard to tell. I sat down on my stool and pulled my crumpled hestia night shirt tight about my torso. And the simulacra mating device hissed into life. There, as if by magic was Danny or Corbett again, telling me about the weather. dumbfounding me, for as he moved his arms in graceful scooping gestures, like a meteorological ballerina. His words were not those are remembered from yesterday evening, but those of Milton Dan said that the story cope of heaven, all the elements, at least, will go to Iraq disturbed and torn. And he was right, of course, for that was precisely what was happening outside. I have concentrated like a mad thing watching him the day before, as I always do. And I was absolutely convinced that what his simulacrum was saying now was not what I had heard then, the Bakelite device could not be at fault for I had had a person from porlock come to give it an overhaul but a week before, and he had pronounced it to be in full working order. Was my brain being monkeyed with by the planet sized monkey of my dreams? I watched Dan Corbett again three times, and three times he spoke of RAC, shutting down the device, I changed into my crumbled hessie an outdoor clothing and hurry down the line to bibley bibs, the bells spill clanged as I staggered into a Pew and prayed as hard as I could for my immortal soul on Tuesday morning.

This is a story about tiny Enid like Kaspar Hauser she was an enigma. Like Petra von can't. she wept bitter tears. And like woodcarver Steiner. She knew great ecstasy. But was it a religious ecstasy? Or was it as for woodcarver Steiner, related to ski jumping at championship level? Had she been so inclined, there is no doubt that tiny Enid could have been a top skier in spite of her clubfoot. For we know that she never allowed that infirmity to dissuade her from the most remarkable exploits. Hang Gliding hot air ballooning, pole vaulting and daring undersea rescues were among her many accomplishments, and she was only narrowly pipped to the post in a Lincoln sport contest. When her Finch Edgar became rattled and tripped Susskind react instead of Cisco wreath in the final minutes, yet we have no evidence that tiny Enid ever strapped on a pair of skis, nor dwelt in an area of snow fallen on sloping ground. Equally However, if hers was a religious ecstasy, were hard put to identify to what brand of supernatural belief it could be ascribed. Those who knew tiny Enid crinkling Glee as they recall that, like Benjamin Perry, she spattered Catholic priests, so I think we can rule out the Ratzinger wristers as we can confidently dismiss any connection to Aztec fundamentalism, given tiny image reported remarks on timax Cal tacky, the goddess of sweatbands, whom she described as far too sweaty. This is not the place to examine tiny ended somewhat unseemly preoccupation with both human and divine sweat from from we must keep on track. That track is the one we hope would lead us to know the source of tiny he needs great ecstasy. With woodcarver Steiner, we know where we stand, as we do with St. Teresa of Avila, and any number of visionary enthusiasts and mystics through the ages. But what can we say of the great ecstasy of tiny Enid except that it remains a puzzle we know she experienced such ecstasy for we have the mezzotints done from the life by the mezzotints East Rex tent, which depict tiny Enid in great transport of joy. It is true as Rex tense SR dot 10 pointed out that in many of these mezzotints timing, Enid could more accurately be described as chuckling or giggling in a childish way it slapstick scenes of pratfalls and lock about rather than convulsed in spiritual ecstasy. But let us not forget that in one of the most well known of the mezzotints tiny Enid is shown so convulsed, standing next to a clown with unmistakable beads of sweat upon his brow, and great patches of perspiration visible under the arms of his clown costume. As he reaches up to flap his big clown gloved hands in some sort of funny business. Tiny Enid would never have laughed at a clown sweaty or not, for she feared them if she feared nothing else on Earth, ever. trawling through the various biographical documents which survived, I found no indication that tiny Enid ever professed any religious impulses whatsoever, nor, for that matter, any more broadly spiritual leanings. Indeed, all accounts agree that she was a severely practical type of heroic infant never more essentially herself than when solving very concrete problems, usually involving the rescue of persons imperiled. One thinks for example, of tiny Enid abseiling down a crevasse to deliver a life saving plan Following bag of nutritious bread pudding to the half starved half frozen polar explorer, so Blinky cheese lip, or digging a tunnel under the vinda van de C to reach a trio of extras from a Verner Hertzog film trapped in a subterranean pool rife with blind albino aquatic tentacle beings, each with thousands of razor sharp fangs and on a suede durable appetites. One picture is tiny Enid kicking a get in the head with her big black boot. Perhaps we must ask. It was her reveries of such deeds which sent her into her great ecstasies we ask but for the time being we cannot answer yes with any great conviction. Not until much further work has been done to disentangle the hugely complicated legacy. Tiny Enid left in her heroic infant tile wake.

And the other day, in the paper I came across I can't remember where it was already. I was reading a paper and there was a story. I came across the phrase Avast and chilli gasworks and this reminded me that for ages now I've been meaning to say something on the show about the blister laying gasworks. More specifically, I wish to address the time that the manager of the gasworks approached Dobson the out of print pamphleteer, asking him to write an instruction manual for the gasworks janitor. The word vast and chilly certainly describe the blister lane gasworks to a tee. They describe to the manager, a man of huge bulk and cold disposition named East van pan. his mustache was of the Kaiser vilhelm type and his eyes were glazed seal. Interestingly, no one could ever recall seeing him off the gasworks premises and how he lived and fended phase everyday needs was a complete mystery. Equally perplexing was the fact that in his left hand at all times he carried a hammer, almost as if it were an extension of his arm. Perhaps it was so chilly was his manner that no one had the temerity to ask him about it. janitors came and went at the gasworks with bewildering rapidity. Some left voluntarily after a few days or weeks, and others were fired by pan often within minutes of their appointment. Curiously, not a single x janitor would speak of their experience remaining steadfast in their silence, even when badgered for a scoop by bumptious reporters from the daily shovel. It is Against this background that one needs to consider Dobson's response when he was summoned to the gasworks by his fan pan. Unfortunately, we do not know how the pamphleteer reacted because there is a gap in his journals covering this period. He may have cried with delight, or he may have shuttered with queasiness, but we're unlikely ever to know. So let's just crack on and find out what happened next. Dobson presented himself at the gasworks gates promptly at six o'clock in the morning on a Monday have blustery gales and drizzle. He was met by a woman so tiny that he mistook her for a female high monkey jealous and wondered if he had been created according to the Paris celsion whoa monkey jealous recipe of burying a bag of bones, semen, skin fragments and hair in the mud for 40 days. tactless as ever. Dobson wondered this aloud and had his knee slapped by the tiny woman. Had he been any taller. No doubt he would have slapped his face, but his knee was as high as she could reach. She introduced herself as Mrs. Pan, wife of the gasworks manager and Bade Dobson follow her down a very long corridor hissing with gas jets, at the end of which was his fan pans office. As enormous as his wife was miniscule pan towered above the pamphleteer as he coldly outlined what he wanted Dobson to do for him before appointing a new gasworks janitor, he explained he wanted to have an instruction manual clearly setting out the janitorial duties, and he wanted it to be written in sweeping magisterial prose so that whoever took on the job would be properly austrac. As he said this he flailed his hammer in the air. He went on to say in a voice redolent of Antarctic desolation, that Dobson had been recommended to him as a writer of sweeping magisterial prose, and as a man who knew a thing or two about janitor dumb. Dobson was curious to know who might have made such a recommendation. But just as he was about to ask Mrs. Pan rushed into the office with a stricken look on her tiny face. The pamphleteer was astonished to see his fans pans cold imperiousness, crumble into usurious solicitude, as he swept his tiny little wife into his arms, and without dropping his hammer comforted her, chirping into her ear softly, like a limit eventually becomes this is pan explained why she was stricken. There had been a pile up on the blister lane bypass, she said, just beyond the gasworks,

and fumes and flames were being blown by the blustery gales in their direction. Unless they took action, the whole place could explode in a conflagration like the one that engulf the potato building just after the war. This van pan looks Dobson coldly in the eye and told him that this was just the kind of circumstance where a competent janitor would be a boon and the pamphleteer could only nod in agreement. Then the gasworks manager turned around and depressed a knob upon his desk and Dobson felt a sudden lurch in the pit of his stomach. It took him a few seconds to realize that the entire vast and chilly gasworks was descending via the thrumming of some incredible and complicated engine. below the surface of the earth into a subterranean vault is vast and chilly is the gasworks itself, while above ground, the Firestorm created by the blister lane bypass pile up raged and raged for days and weeks and months. For many years now Dobson is to hunted high and low for a copy of the legendary missing pamphlet. How I spent six months underground in an amazing subterranean vault built to house the blister lane gasworks, together with Mr. And Mrs. Pan and their cat who do bras. If ever a copy can be discovered, we might learn what happened in that time. And more importantly, why when his van pan at last press the knob to return the gasworks to ground level. His plans to have a janitorial instruction manual written in sweeping and magisterial prose by Dobson seemed to have been utterly abandoned. We might learn to whether it was giant his van pan or tiny Mrs. Pan, or even perhaps Dobson himself, who managed to train who do brass the cat to carry out all the tasks the matter the manager expected of a vast and chilly gasworks.

Lastly, this week, I think Lastly, probably I originally came across a fascinating personality test. Normally I give short shrift to such things because they tend to be devised by Airheads drunk on a combination of psychobabble in inanity. But this one delighted me. Unfortunately, I can't read out the whole thing verbatim. Here. rarely have I seen a document so thoroughly protected by copyright threatening extreme measures up to an including the crushing of one skull and the sail into slavery of one's descendants. Yay unto the fourth generation, very occasionally, I've shown a devil may care attitude in the face of such warnings, but I'm not an idiot. Anyway, excuse me anyway, as far as I can see, and there's nothing to stop me paraphrasing a few of the questions from the test. So that's what I'll do. It's called Are you bird or a cow. I looked in vain for any indication that these are meant as types of human personality. So I can only assume that we're meant to take it literally. Maybe the test is meant to be conducted on behalf of your bird or cow acquaintances who are confused about their identity. Now, it would make perfect sense when you think about it. So for example, there are questions like question seven, would you say you were flighty or given to rumination? And question 11. A, do you prefer standing in a field or purchasing high up in a tree? Remember, I'm only paraphrasing these, then that's exactly how it's written. And one question asked specifically whether for breakfast you would prefer to eat millet or card. Ugly it doesn't go on to ask about elevens his lunch, dinner, tea or supper. And nor is there any mention of snacks. This may indicate a certain laxness in the methodology employed par for the course with tests such as this. But given the ferocious look on the face of the person who devised it, whose photograph appears at the top of the first page, I'm minded not to level any criticism. I am, I did complete the test for myself, rather than a proxy for my Crow, Martin, or for a cow I know called de gustibus. And the results were extremely interesting. But I'm not going to tell you what they were.

So that's it for hooting yard this week. I did have something else to read, but if anything, there's really time to read it. So I could what could I do? I could tell you to go to the website, www dot hooting yard.org where you will find just endless endless stuff to read. archives going back to December 2003. Long, long ago. Anyway, so go and read that and while you're there you might like to buy the might take the opportunity to buy one of the hooting yard books there's unspeakable desolation pouring down from the stars. Or befuddled by cormorants. Yeah, so do that. And remember that this show is repeated at one o'clock on Monday afternoon, if you want to listen to it again, and fully, fully absorb the meaning of it all. Bye bye.
