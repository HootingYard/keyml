Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. This is hooting yard on the air and I am your genial host, Frank key. I say dreamy Oh, no, no, maybe I'll become grumpy at some point. But for the time being, I shall attempt to be your dream your host. And I'd like to begin this week with a letter I received from Dr. Ruth pastry and possibly trying to pretend she was on a board an ocean liner when she wrote it are wholly their key. She writes, I have a few questions for you about Dobson's magnificent collection of boots. Often in stories were told about the Austrian Postal Service ones, and the Nova scotian seabird tagging patrol ones. And we can add to these the many other boots we've learned about over the years, those designed for Hungarian flying officers, not least among them. What I want to know is did Dobson have some sort of official connection with the many and various organizations whose boots he saw fit to where are there gaps in the biography where he was where he was, unbeknownst to us actually employed by them? If this is the case, I really think it's time we were filled in on the details. Or if not, it begs the question of how an out of print pamphleteer managed to obtain what what I presume were pairs of boots normally made available only to those tireless servants who, for example, delivered the post in Australia or tagged seabirds in Nova Scotia. I do not want to think even for a second that Dobson may have gone marauding around the globe thieving boots wherever he found them. It pains me to consider the very real possibility that my favorite pamphleteer may have been wallowing in a fetid swamp of moral turpitude. I suppose it's only fair to declare an interest here. As you know, I'm a woman of impeccable rectitude, and would never ever stoop to thievery. But for many years now, I have been coveting a pair of Uruguayan butchers assistant boots, and I cannot for the life of me think how in heaven's name I can get my mitts on such an item, short of becoming an assistant to a Uruguayan butcher position for withdrawn, hopelessly unqualified. My final question then, is to ask if you have any advice for me in this regard, not that I'm expecting sensible answers to any of my queries, given the key track record, but I live in hope, and at least I've got this off my chest. I'm now going to wander up onto the deck of this entirely factual ocean liner and stare at the sea before eating my dinner at the captain's table, jealously eyeing his Peruvian sea captain's boots, which have been covered in a fashion very similar to the boots I covered passionately yours, Dr. Ruth pastry.

I was mistaken recently on the hootin yard website@www.oneonone.org suggests that Dobson wrote a pamphlet called kitchen groanings there is actually a late 18th century work of that name, penned by an angry cook when shore discontented housemade I was sure there was some kind of Dobson connection, and I left to the most obvious thought that it was yet another out of print pamphlet by the out of print pamphlet here. Unable to place it however, I knitted my brows and set the tiny engines whirring in my pea sized yet pulsating brain. And eventually in the middle of the night, I realized I've been thinking of a radio program made by marigold Chu in the dying days of 19 53 invited by the visionary radio producer, Doug hammer shield, no relation to the then Secretary General of the United Nations dag Hammarskjold to create a piece of sound art for his fledgling fledgling long wave radio station. Radio dag Hammarskjold, marigold true. rummaged in the broom cupboard where she allit upon her vintage blatner phone, a modified wire recorder that was the precursor of the mid 20th century tape recorder. The briefcase he had been given by the producer was precise. Dr. marigold Chu, who wrote to her in his spidery handwriting. Here at Radio, Doug hammer showed were on the lookout for pieces of belligerent combative, confrontational sound art of between six and 10 hours in length. Usually, the stuff we're sent consists of a lot of guttural shouting, often in German, which is fantastic as far as it goes, but it will be nice to bombard listeners with something a little more challenging. I know you used to sweep across the fields outside pointy town 20 years ago with your blatner phone, recording cows and peasants. And I wonder if you would rummage around in your broom cupboard for the vintage machine and make a program for us, which we would broadcast every day for months on end, or at least until our license comes up for renewal. marigold had fond memories of the bucolic field recording she made in her younger days, and looked forward to heading out to her old homes armed with the blatner phone, mindful that there would be new cows in the fields and older peasants digging the ditches. She was already putting a sound collage together in her head, deciding to add the noises of rotting badgers and babbling Brooks to the mix. She took the blatner phone from the broom cupboard and put it on the kitchen table and went upstairs to dig out the bus timetable and a map from her bedside bus and train timetable and map and chart and diagram cupboard. Alas. On the landing, she tripped over a pile of Dobson's out of print pamphlets, fell clunking her head on a hard thing and lost consciousness. Meanwhile, down in the kitchen, the pamphleteer himself had just returned from a pointless errand. He was exhausted and rancorous, carrying the kettle across the room from it place of boiling on a counter to its place of filling at the sink. He bashed it inadvertently against the blatner phone, and in so doing flick the switch which set the machine recording. For the next six hours, every noise that Dobson made, was picked up and preserved for posterity on the thin steel tape of the blatner phone. Most of these noises were groans for Dobson sat slumped at the kitchen table with his head in his hands, shifting only to make and then to drink copious cups of tea. If by his groaning he was trying to gain marigold two's attention, he was staring failure in the face. She being splayed flat on the landing away with the fairies. Indeed, she later recalled that during her swoon, which lasted the same six hours as Dobson's groaning in the kitchen below, she had visions of fairies and elves and parries and Aziza and nymphs, and sat is and Tim, and leprechauns and sprites, and do n days and Pixies and goblins. It was not often her head was cluttered up with such twaddle. And when she awoke, she was mightily discombobulated.

Mighty is my discombobulation Dobson, she said, she staggered into the kitchen and she told the pamphleteer of her trip and fall and clunk and swoon, Dobson groaned. The worst of it is, she continued ignoring him, that my head is now so fairy filled, presumably as a direct result of the clunk that I'm having the devil of a job trying to remember what I was doing, or indeed, why on earth I might have rummaged in the broom cupboard for that dear old blattner phone, which I see is perched on the table whirring away. Dobson's groaning had been so terrific. He had not even noticed the modified wire recorder perched like a miniature science fiction windmill between a packet of cornflakes and the tea strainer. But before he could speak a hammering was heard at the door like the knocking the gate in Macbeth Dobson ceased groaning and went to see who it was who could be paying a visit at so ungodly an hour. It was visionary radio producer dog how much he old Who shoved the pamphleteer aside as if he was so much chaff and bounded into the kitchen, where he babble that marigold, chew, as if in an ungodly frenzy. ungodly hours and ungodly frenzies can often come in twos and like magpies even in threes. And as if to prove this last point and ungodly magpie came sweeping through the sky and smashed into the kitchen window, clunking its small birdie head and falling into a swoon. Not unlike that, from which marigold two had just woken, such as a furious interconnections of the known universe. marigold marigold babbled Hammarskjold, I see you have been making your type of belligerent combative, confrontational sound art of between six and 10 hours in length, or be it in your kitchen rather than out in the field. Thank heaven you have done so I must snatch the tape immediately from the blatner phone and take it to the studio for we have suffered a calamity involving carpet beetles and the queuing clean through of wiring and other dramatic events worse than the worst things that happen at sea. And if I do not have a field recording to broadcast right now, my fledgling long wave station will be shut down by the radio police. That's it was that later that evening listeners to radio dag Hammarskjold retreated to six hours of Dobson's kitchen groanings and the station was saved for another day. The program caused a short lived brouhaha and the column inches of obscure avant garde sound art magazines were filled with guff about it. marigold Chu herself disowned the recording, and rightly so for it was not the tape he meant to make. Although since the dying days of 1953 when always happened, Brian ino has taught us to honor our errors as hidden intentions. marigold Chu never counted herself as an email list, and forever regretted that she had not caught up with the cows and the peasant, the Badgers and Brooks for which as far as she was concerned, the blatner phone had been invented. In any case, actually wrote in a letter many years later. I have to listen to Dobson's kitchen groanings day in day out for as long as they lasted, and I did not consider them to be sound art. If I want sound art, like any sensible person, I will listen to ill tempered Germans shouting their heads off, or to cows and peasants and rotting badgers and babbling Brooks Dobson's kitchen groanings. Like all his other groanings work for me merely the groanings of an out of print pamphleteer. The old would have been writing, not groaning in the kitchen with his head in his hands as the blatner phone word and hissed and the standard and godly magpie lay on the window sill away with whatever fairies clutter the tiny heads of birds.

Look news now and indefatigable paper back east pebble head has yet another new book out this week. Planet of the cloth EOD bears is a sci fi pop boiler, featuring heroic Spaceman, Captain befo Melvyn Bragg The story begins with the captain spaceship forced to crash land on a remote planet, populated entirely by bears who are hard of hearing, scorched beyond repair. The spaceships engines attract the attention of some of the bears, who communicate with each other by a complex system of poor manipulation. Captain befoe who has among his accomplishments, a diplomate in earth, bear behavioral studies, is bit flummoxed when he realizes he cannot fathom the space bears lingua franca. Using his space spade, the captain digs a pit in the spectacularly gruesome soil of the planet's surface, hoping to trap at least one of the bears in it. But these are widely spaced bears, and they wait for the captain to finish digging his pit before dissolving his space spade using their exciting Ray guns. Then they put befo himself into the pit. For 40 pages of the paperback are then taken up with the captain's musings about his predicament, which include passages of blatant plagiarism from writers such as WNP Bob bellion Stefan's vike Sylvia Townsend Warner and prudence foxglove. pebble haters either forgotten about the rest of the spaceship crew, or wishes us to believe that Captain befoe was flying a solo mission. The latter is highly unlikely given the nature of interplanetary protocols at the time, described carefully and at length in pro leg dominum. The sort of thing pebble head can dash off as breezily as the rest of us would write a shopping list if we still had shops to go to in this wasteland. Eventually, the cloth EOD space bears haul Captain befo out of the pit with a winch and subject him to a personality profile questionnaire. This is given in multiple choice format, which allows pebble head to play around quite foolishly with the conventions of multiple choice personality profile questionnaires. It transpires that befoe is a drugged up chaffinch type, the most dangerous personality profile as far as the space bears are concerned. They put befo back in the pit and holder BAM moot. pebble head has great fun with this, probably more so than his readers. At the end of the mood, half of the planet suns explode for no apparent reason. befo exploits the resulting mayhem and confusion to clamber out of the pit and to sprint towards his hobbled spaceship. Just before he gets there, a cloth eared space bears zapped him with a different type of exciting Reagan befo does not dissolve, but instead is himself transformed into one of the space bears. Somehow his hearing is not impaired by this metamorphosis, and it becomes a valued member of the community, even though he never quite masters the poor manipulation technique. And the final pages pebble had described with exquisite dullness, the slow rusting and disintegration of the spaceship over many planet years, until Not a trace of it remains. And then just as we're thinking What a waste of time the whole book has been. Captain befo or rather the space bear he has become goes into a kind of spasmodic fit sheds his space bear characteristics and a form of echo dices knocks together a brand new spaceship out of space cardboard boxes and space twigs and space gum. Weirdly, transmogrified the planet's atmosphere, so the space bears can hear properly, and blasts off into the boundless firmament heading for his next adventure. Word has it that pebble head has already written three quarters of the sequel, but he's keeping under his hat, whether it will be about Captain befoe, or about the no longer cloth eared bears. If you want to know more about pebble heads hat and what else he keeps under it, and will soon be a You will soon be able to register for a newsletter in paper form delivered to your door by the post he once in a blue moon or when the cows come home.

In a huge church bell lies on the side is battered and dented, but it's clapper remains intact. Next to the bell is a crate of toads. The toads have been counted and recounted at least three times by the toad counting person whose coat and cat are hung or off hook on the back wall between the bell and the crate. The Toad counting person himself is no longer present. We are to understand later that he's been called away to an urgent Toad count elsewhere, one for which he is permitted to dispense with his coat and cap, hence the presence on the hook. The toads have all been injected with a narcotic drug, they are still some of them are toxic toads, but it's not immediately apparent which ones and this will prove significant later on. Alongside the crate of toads is an occasional table on which has been placed a fiendishly embroidered tablecloth. It's a bit tatty around the edges, which overhanging the table almost to the floor. The tattiness, we will learn is the result of it having been nude by wild beasts arrayed atop the table upon the cloth, or a whisk and a jar of unidentified paste, and a Bible and a squirting utensil molded from bright plastic. Later we will learn that an accompanying funnel has been stolen from this tabletop arrangement by person or persons are known as the legal parlance has it, detectives will become involved. Then there is a gap. There is a trap door in the gap, but it's been secured with fastening pins to prevent accidents. Beyond the gap is a sofa, plump Lee upholstered Baxter is reclining on the sofa wearing a cardigan and slacks and plimsolls he is smoking a pipe and between puffs is whistling. Oh Danny boy. He is an expert Whistler and the sound he makes is grating upon the ears. His hair is absolutely caked with brilliant team. behind the sofa looms a piece of classical statuary. It is a representation of a generic Greek or Roman god. Later there will be a brouhaha over the identity of the God which will remain unresolved. Eastern even after blood has been shed, and a terrible vendetta sparked. The head of the God is out of proportion to the body, and the legs are ill made and the words wersi and lack of ornament, although they are for the most part hidden by the sofa. Past the sofa there is another Toad, this time solo and uncrated although like the other Toad It has been a nice the ties and it's still the toad may have escaped the earlier Toad counting and it may be toxic, or the converse may be the case on both counts, that is the counting and the toxicity. The Toad may have been counted, and it may be a non toxic toad. Baxter will be compelled to address these issues later, leading to the irretrievable loss of his wits. Finally, the opposite end from the battered and dented Bell, there is an iron spigot by dint of a faulty washer it is leaking and drops of water of falling into a pan placed at its foot. It is quite a big pan, tin and pristine as it is come directly from the manufacturers production line. Lights are cleverly directed to shine upon it, making it gleam brightly, almost as brightly as the sun enter stage right, the anti Baxter and those were the opening stage directions for his fans scrim draws drawing room, tragic comedy, The bell and the toads, etc. It's 1951 production at the festival of Britain closed 20 minutes into act one. It has never been revived.
