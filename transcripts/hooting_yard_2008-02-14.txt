Good evening and welcome to this week's shooting yard with me Frank key this week number two in a series of previously and podcasts stories and this is called by aerostat hunting yard. So wanted this to be a seafaring yarn. I wanted to hear the wind in the rigging smell was salt Tang in the breeze roll with the creek and lurch of old wooden boards on the deck. I wanted to write a maritime tale of a fabric woven of ships cables and hoses and Arctic wind blowing through it and birds of prey hovering over it. I wanted to prattle on about smacks bilgewater focus on some splicing the main brace whatever that means. Pirates will appear cutlasses, gleaming perched in the crow's nest, I will yell alanda hoy, then scurry down the rigging to help tamp down the pinnacles. Now first things have looked hopeful. I had received my instructions from Dobson as as he was precise. track down verbal, he wrote, beat him to death with a club, wrap him in chains and throw him down a flooded mineshaft I should expect a full report upon your return dogs. As soon as I have read his memo, I doused it in highly flammable chemicals and took it down to the boiler room of my building. There in solitude and gloom. I placed it in the roaring furnace. The flames licked up towards my face, and I turned away. I knew the tears will not be long in coming. In been two years since one of Dobson's communicated, uprooting me from my rut and catapulted me into frantic adventure. Three years before that I had been sent on a mission ranging over four continents. The year before that embroiled in a world shattering plot, and there had been at least half a dozen earlier escapades. No doubt these Dobson inspired excitements were meant to be wild and life enhancing. Yes, I yearned for tedium and futility. trudging out of the boiler room I began to solve. It would be weeks, perhaps months before I could once again wallow in monotony and on we despite my misgivings, I'm very particular about my work. Dobson has even accused me of being finicky. I began to pack up once having dusted down the enormous half a sack which I always carry on my assignments. Within an hour of receiving my instructions, the packing was done, and I was perched on a wooden stool in my kitchen, morphing down above slops. I had no idea when next I would eat. Having twice been struck by lightning while doing Dobson's bidding, I have taken the precaution of sprinkling finely ground purslane onto my slops and stashing a small patch of the stuff in my house. another half hour and I was out of the door and on my way. The weather was incomprehensible. I shall not record it here. I checked my watch by the gasworks clock and spat into a hedgerow. It was not for me to question why Dobson wanted burble obliterated, and I could not help feeling a small pang of surprise. I had always understood burble to be a trusted agent, a man who could be relied upon. I knew for a fact that he'd been invaluable when Perkins and throwback contracted the dank and what ensnared by abandoned repressed mappings. I can only assume that he had lately committed some heinous offense for which Dobson could not forgive him on earth could he have done but I couldn't allow myself to dwell on such matters. It wouldn't get the dog bathed, the roof fed or the baby mended, whatever that saying is a spat into a hedgerow and lurched onwards.

Over the years, I've paid a great deal of attention to gait and have a repertoire of ambulatory techniques which the greatest of actors would envy. My usual form of locomotion is a sort of official lump. It should go without saying that when engaged on one of Dobson's missions, I say, diligent paint to disguise this, prancing, hobbling, limping, trudging and scampering cannot be brought into play. I am unusually adept at hurtling, stamping and kept rolling, and have on occasion found it useful to bound strike. Plot guide or stalk. However, in the initial stages of any mission, I am an inveterate lurker I found that it aids the circulation, pose the brain and abolishes any creeping panic. One day I shall write an essay explaining why I lurched to the docks Of course, all Dobson's assignments begin at the docks while eating up the pan of slops in my kitchen. I had done a spotter preliminary research. The first thing I had to do was to find burble, and he could be anywhere. leafing through my card index. I traced his movements over the past year. He had spent Easter with wooden berry in the Antarctic swiftly moving on through bloody fall and concrete like disappointment. elk, flin, Flon and gubbio. I already knew that he'd been in Hobart for most of July. I was not able to discover his whereabouts during the latter part of that month, or for the first week in August. On May 8, however, he turned up in innsmouth, staying only a couple of days before a frantic spree through drop out poor kin tap logs, middle term, NaVi bog or pickled Crow, corn reindeer, Depo. Black. He spent Christmas in teutoburg wild and typically so in the New Year announced again there was a gap then burble turned up once more in February in xentry, than in weed. After that, he travelled through zaxy x yarden zog an intriguing fellow I thought to myself, but was he still in zog? I can only find out by going there. After all, I had to start somewhere. I allowed half an hour for the slots to digest. Using the time to trawl through the shipping timetables. I could make head nor tail of them. My head spans shimmers and jangles frolicked in my brain and I nearly threw up my slops. I ingested a handful of crushed mugwort and immediately felt better. damned good lurch weighed down by my massive half a sack helped to dispel further the throbbing in myself. It took just four hours to arrive at the docks. They were splendid, but indescribable. I think Dobson attempted to write about them in one of his absurd pamphlets. But as usual, I cannot remember a word of it. It hardly matters. I lurched past a group of stevedores that were mucking about with torque wrenches, basket length of flax, that sort of equipment. One of them resplendent in a toxic vest hailed me. You there he cried. Can you lend us a hand with these torque wrenches bust
