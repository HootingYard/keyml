good evening resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key This is hooting out on the air. I haven't been here for a couple of weeks where something horrible has happened

Frank Key  01:02
I'm gonna have to can you put the music back on

Frank Key  01:18
technical Horace sorted out Yeah, I haven't been here for a couple of weeks because I'm thinking having my eyes attended to add an Eye Hospital. But I can well I can see well enough to blunder about the place and, and even read if I have very big type and sometimes microscope or a microscope magnifying glass magnet. Yeah, anyway, so I think instead of babbling, I should just start reading something too. Otherwise the half hour will pass by in a daze of stupidity. A vulture was hacking at my feet. I punched it in the throat and it flew away up to a corner of the cage, where it perched furious. I was furious to get myself out of the cage, clanging the door behind me and went straight to the band dad jury. It was shot which made me more furious. I took a plum from my pocket it quickly and threw the stone at a wind cat. I missed that the act of throwing calmed me down. leaving a trail of blood from the wounds in my feet. I crossed the site to my cabin. I was about to go in when the hooter hooted definitely. We are trained to stand absolutely still Chin up hyper alert, all wax removed from our ears, to await whatever announcement or command or diktat or you case will follow. When at last the sound of the hooter died. I heard the grunting the grating voice of grandma PIP straw ordering me may to report immediately to the cause Ponte. It was the first time I had ever heard my name spoken aloud by grandma PIP straw, and I felt a curious admixture of pride and terror. I sprinted to the cars pumped as fast as my vulture hacked feet would allow the security get scammed the identity number tattooed on the side of my neck, and shoved me along a passageway in to the inmost hub. Grandma PIP straw was sitting on her musnad knitting. She looked up at me, and I saw reproaching her half blind eyes. We have CCTV footage of you punching Geraldine the vulture in the throat. She said, What have you got to say for yourself? Actually, don't answer that. You will be wine and I can't stand whining. So a voucher hacks at your feet. What do you expect? Birds are savage wild creatures. woodpecker will pack you if you are made of wood. A Swan can break your arm. According to Tim Henman, a vulture will hack at your feet. Deal with it. But you do not punch Geraldine in the throat. You're fired. The security gate will escort you roughly off the premises now be gone from my half blind sight. And that is how I lost my job as an aviary assistant grandma pips drawers lovely zoo. unemployed, penniless and hopeless. I wandered from the seaside resort to seaside resort, jostling with seagulls as we scavenge for scraps. Then one night when the seagulls were asleep, I was rummaging in a municipal seaside dustbin and I found a discarded copy of Dobson's pamphlet, things to do when you have been dismissed from your job at a zoo, out of print. I wondered what qualified the 20th century's greatest pamphleteer to expound on the subject. As far as I was aware, Dobson had never been employed by a zoo in any capacity. So I approached his text with a measure of caution. I was bowled over the pros was hysterical and jarring, but Dobson really seemed to know what he was talking about. Over 40 closely typed pages, he suggested two things to do for somebody in my predicament. I can't remember the first one, possibly because I did not understand it. But the second suggestion was absolutely brilliant. I will not quote the pamphleteer directly on legal advice, but the gist of it was run away and join a circus. I tossed the pamphlet back into the dustbin, and I ran away.

Frank Key  06:19
Oh how I ran. Some weeks later, I eventually arrived panting at a big top pitched in a mud stricken field on the outskirts of pointy town. While running, I have had plenty of time to devise a circus act, which I wish sure would see me welcomed with open arms. Before going into the tent, I brushed my hair and removed all the wax from my ears. Then I prance through the 10th flap and presented myself before the circus ringmaster who went by the name Baruch Spinoza. Hello, I chirped. I would like to join your circus. I see. He said, Who are you? And what is your circus act? I am little mini pips draw the amazing vulture puncher. I said, I punched vultures in the throat. That sounds highly entertaining, said the ringmaster you're hired. I would like to say that I was an instant success at Baruch Spinoza his big top but in truth it took several years to perfect my act. Initially, I had a great deal of difficulty finding an available vulture and had to make do with a toy one made of marzipan my punching technique with my dainty little fist one the crowds over and when I upgraded to a Pappy and mash a vulture the applause was thunderous. It so happened that one muggy summer's day we pitched our circus tent in a mud stricken field slap bang next to grandma straws, a lovely zoo. I could not resist paying a visit. Though years had passed. The same security gates stood on guard at the gate. He did not recognize me. When I tried to enter he stopped me. The zoo is shot he said grandma PIP straw passed beyond this mortal realm last week. She became hopelessly entangled in the rivals of wall she was knitting with fatal results. We shall not see her like again. To pay her funeral costs. We're selling off the zoo animals and aviary birds bargain bin prices. Can I interest you in anything? Of course I jumped at the chance to buy a real life voucher for 35 pence. I took it back to the big top happier I think than I had ever been. Goodbye mozzie pattern pm ASHRAE. From this day on little mini tip screw the amazing vulture puncher really would be amazing. But in my glory and excitement there was one thing I had not accounted for. It is a signal fact, at least in this work that vultures have a sort of hereditary memory passed down from parents to hatchlings that are hurt inflicted on a vulture will be remembered by that vultures offspring and their offspring and their offspring. Yay onto every generation. And Dennis, my bargain been 35 p vulture, was a direct descendant of Geraldine. That night in the big top I promised into the ring with Dennis by my side. As the crowd gawped I punched him in the throat with my dainty fist. He flew away up into a corner of the tent where he perched on tool circus pole and there came swimming into his vulture brain. The inherited memory of his great great grandmother, Geraldine also punched in the throat years ago by little mini dip straw, whose feet she was hacking as any vulture would hack. Dennis was furious. He fixed his Volcker gaze on me standing in the ring bellow, accepting the wild applause of the circus crowd. And he swooped he descended upon me at a dazzling speed and plunged his beak down my throat. A vulture avenged falling back, I was relieved to feel him drowning irretrievably in my blood, which was filling every depth flooding every shore. The first sentence translated from the German everything in between.

This is called the knock the manor gate. It was summer a hot day. I was eating breakfast when I was disturbed by a knocking at the manor gate, pushing my lemon meringue pie to one side, I picked up my portable arrow phone or pop and snapped it open. I held it at arm's length above my head until I lock it locks on to my factotum kampot akiak chiaroscuro image of his head floating in a haze of static appeared on the screen. I pressed the Pops summoning knob and waited.

Frank Key  12:17
While I waited, I thought about Trump hot days can pass without encountering him, and I wanted to be sure it was indeed Heath who answered the summons. He has been our family factotum since long before I was born, if it is possible to be both suave and decrepit, both urbane and toothless. That was kampot Heaven knows how aged he was all from what would his crutches had been fashioned. Eventually he appeared creaking in the doorway. I told him I had heard a knocking at the manor gate and would have him investigate. He must had something unintelligible and went away. I finished off the lemon meringue pie, and started in started in on a dish of bloaters. I have eaten all but one of them when kampot returned, bringing with him a stranger. This fellow was nondescript, so I shall not descript him. Good morning on this hot summer's day. He said, I am detective Captain Kirk pan and I have come to place you under arrest. I was momentarily disconcerted but quickly realized the coppers error. You are confusing me with kampot. I said gesturing at the factotum He is a member of the lower orders the servant class and that's given to act of malfeasance. By all means, take him away. Your factotum is as innocent as a newborn kitten said card pan. It is you I have come for an E spat in my eye. But I have done nothing wrong. I cried. Are you sure of that? said the policeman spitting in my other eye. The crimes of humankind and numberless numberless. For example, in Thailand, it is against the law for an individual to own more than 120 playing cards. But we're not in Thailand and I do not own that many playing cards. I shot back. Well said card pan looking thoughtful. Those are both matters we can look into down at the station in the basement interrogation chamber. We might also find out whether you've ever taken hold of a salmon in a suspicious manner. Whistle excessively allowed a chicken to cross a major thoroughfare or given a pig the name Napoleon who knows what you might have done in addition to the hyenas, enormity for which I'm arresting you I was about to ask what that was that cargo van whacks me on the windpipe with his truncheon. I saw my factotum smirking as I gasp for breath. I was astonished to hear the copper say, excellent work chum pot. Then the pair of them bundled in a nun to gently out of the room and down the stairs and along the hallway and out of the malla door and into the back of car pans gleaming black police van. As we drove along boschi country lanes towards the village police station, I experienced a shocking epiphany. Despite his suavity and urbanity Trump was a most untidy man. His clothing was ragged and filthy. His shoes were always caked with mud, and I suspect he was a stranger to shampoo yet he wore pinned to his chest a broke, polished to a gleam every day, a gleam so bright that when it caught the sun on hot summer days, such as this flash gas, gold vermilion, I'd almost blinded the observer with its brilliance. It was an oddity compared with the factotum General unseemliness. And once long ago, I had asked him about it. This brooch belonged to my dear departed mother, he told me she was a sainted woman, a paragon of virtue, a model of kindness. She spent untold years, resuscitating newborn kittens whose owners had drowned them in the toilet. I was devoted to her. She took her last dying breath in the drainage ditch, where her poor withered body pass beyond this cruel world. She pressed her brooch into my hand, and made me promise to wear it every day, and to polish it to a dream every day in her memory. And I have kept that promise, I could do no other. I found this little speech emotionally shattering and I wept.

Frank Key  17:11
And now in the back of the police fan, I was again emotionally shattered, and again I wept for I suddenly saw what I had been blind to for so many years. Trump had lied to me. His broach was a police bag. Well, how was item No. This was in the days before we all became familiar with coppers and their ways through endless television crime dramas and police procedurals. In any case, Trump was, as I had told card pan, a member of the servant class, as any phrenologist will tell you, though such specimens are a bitterly dishonest. They lack the intelligence necessary to embroider so credible and heart wrenching A Tale of trumpets I count of his dying mother. I was still in a state of mental chaos when they tied me to a chair in the basement interrogation chamber, and Shawna Clyde light into my eyes. From behind it, I heard the suave and urbane voice of kampot, as if for the first time. Well, well, well, he said, I suppose I ought to introduce myself or reintroduce myself. I am detective cadet kampot. Though you might prefer to think of me as the recording Angel. I've been keeping tabs on you for years and years since before you were born. And in that time, I've gathered enough evidence of your unimaginably numerous and multifarious crimes to have you banged up in Kochi for a very long time indeed. My boss, Detective Captain Kirk pan says he's never seen such a lengthy rap sheet. I suppose we'd better make a start on it. So in your own words, tell me about the time you cooked an item mute swan. That was as you well knew the property of the queen, as all mute swans are. And so began my interrogation. I confess to everything on that long, long list. I sang like a canary. And all the while in my throbbing brain, I kept asking myself, what would become of that last uneaten? bloater in my breakfast dish? That is the great question. Or rather, it would be if I still had any prospect of release. And in that piece, the first sentence and the last were translated from the drove and by will an Edwin Moore and everything in between was not

should go is a bird I remember from my childhood, it was often to be seen perched on the railings around the plot of what once had been a thriving orchard, now overgrown with weeds and nettles. The trees were dead or dying. The gold was alive and raucous. It was a one legged gal, its other leg a stump, having suffered a catastrophic bird injury. I admired its ability to balance on the railings. I admire to its inhuman savagery. Birds and not like us, not at all. As a loose end, one day when Harold Wilson was Prime Minister, I fashioned the dole orchard girl from my wire coat hanger and cloth and rags and cotton wool and pipe cleaners are used lollipop sticks for their legs, snapping two thirds of the length of one to represent the stump. I finished making the dollar at 10 o'clock in the morning, and went missing off along the line towards the orchard. I placed my doll on the railings near to where the orchard go often perched. Though there was no sign of it that morning. When I returned home, my mom and power were discussing the death recently announced a month short of her 90th birthday of Alice be topclass. I remember how I got into a spat about her middle name, pass or it was blossom. While ma was sure it was by bat. Ma was right. But it was several days before she was able to claim victory when the mobile library with its reference books came to our neck of the woods. Late that afternoon I returned to the orchard to see how my gold doll was getting along. As I approached the railings, I saw that it had been rent asunder, torn to shreds, clearly within human savagery. The orchard goal itself was nowhere to be seen, but I had no doubt that attacked and destroyed my dog. It pains me that the orchard girl had plainly loathed its likeness. I gathered up the few stray remnants of coat hanger and cloth and rag and cotton wool and pipe cleaners and lollipop sticks and returned home resolved to make a more flattering replica.

Once again, I've met with a technical problem. I want to point out in talking about technical problems. Any of you visiting the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org should be aware that at the moment, it's been attacked by Gremlins, and is the sometimes if he try and go to hooting yard, it takes you to one of those evil sites that I don't know, remove all your bank account details or something. So I haven't been updating the site while that's been going on. I'm hoping that it will resolve itself fairly soon. And I'll be able to go back to posting things but be warned, it's probably not necessarily a good idea to go to hooting yard for a while. Although I have found that you can go there and and if the first time you try and go there it goes wrong and then the second time This all goes right again. So you might want to risk it. But I'm babbling because I'm still having problems finding you the next thing I want to read to you so we'll have a bit more music.

Frank Key  25:53
And I couldn't I don't know what's going on here. I'm having great difficulty, but I thought I would end with a folk song. This is already great focus on I think. Actually, it's two voices, and I've only got one but we'll just that you'll just have to imagine is two voices. old farm a frack, old farm a frack What are you carrying in your sack? of half a dozen weasels in my sack. Three for Jill and three for jack. Are you sure they're weasels and stoats are even little baby goats? No, they're weasels of that I'm sure. Now get in the barn and lock the door. And our farmer frac burns the barn to the ground and swings his soccer weasels round and round. Then it climbs up to the top of polka dot Hill. gives the sack of weasels to jack and jill, how Thank you. Thank you all farmer frac. We've always wanted weasels in a sack. So there you go. And oh, here's, I think that Yeah, there's just time to read this to you. This is an extract from three possible lives by floured JD. And this is from the life of Thomas de Quincey. Although he's not actually mentioned in the text. Henry through slavery is a diet of raw meat in order to obtain splendid dreams. Lamb spoke of liliput he and rabbits when eating frog fricassee and a sister Mary wielding a knife chase the little girl who was helping her in the kitchen, and then stabbed her own mother through the heart. Hazlitt with perceptive about musculature and boxes. Wordsworth used a buttery knife to cut the pages of a first edition book. Coleridge his head shrouded over in a fog, read poetry badly, and mustard gloomily. There were others who helped themselves to dreams. Robert savvi experimented with laughing gas, and Radcliffe sought out huge quantities of indigestible food to reinforce a terrible night visions and lamb complained about the derelict impoverishment of his dreams. And that's all from hooting out for this week. I hope I'll be back next week and not back in hospital having my eyes seem to hopefully hooting yard the website will be back on track very shortly. And until when is goodbye for me, and it's goodbye from john. By the go I've told you. Okay, next week.
