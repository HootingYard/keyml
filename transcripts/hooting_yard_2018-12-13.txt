resonance 104 point four FM My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air the penultimate show before Christmas 2018. And the Oxford University Press A couple of years ago published volume seven of its majestic, Collected Works of Gerard Manley Hopkins. The racist book, a snippet, 110 pounds, is devoted to the diaries, journals and notebooks. As a good Catholic, Hopkins kept a record of, of the sins he committed. And the new addition of his letters and diaries includes not letters, diaries, journals and notebooks. The new edition includes previously suppressed details we learned for example of frequent bouts of old age old habits, I think we can guess what that means, and of occasions when unseemly thoughts are prompted by the sight of choristers, kart boys and other young men. But several other entries are suggestive of the fathomless depths of the poet's sickening depravity and moral turpitude. He confesses in the privacy of his diary to quote looking at and thinking of stallions, unquote, and worse, much worth self indulgence at Croydon in fruit. How Hopkins escaped prison is one of the enduring mysteries of Victorian Jesuit literature.

Yes, self-indulgence at Croydon in fruit. Which brings us brings us is is our theme for this week. Last week theme was poultry. This week's theme is fruit. And Dobson's six lectures on fruit were among the most highly regarded of his works held in an esteem that the contemporary reader finds unfathomable. revisiting these pamphlets, but it swiftly becomes apparent that Dobson had no idea what he was talking about. The revised view of the lectures is put best by one upstart young Dobson scholar who dismisses them as bloviating and orotund. Consider the first lecture on the putting on the putting of fruit into pies, in which Dobson challenges the accepted definitions of both fruit and pie, not to mention the usual meanings of the verb to put. Some critics like to pretend that the essay is a precursor of what would become known as post modernism or deconstruction, and in as much as it's clueless gibberish, that correct. In his defense, the pamphleteer does not dress up as his babble in needlessly complicated, pseudo academic jargon. Indeed, his language is direct, even earthy and littered with harsh Anglo Saxon expletives. But he betrays depth of almost unimaginable ignorance. The climax of the lecture is supposed to be a recipe for what Dobson calls a prune and lemon pastry explosion. But the instructions are so befogged by weightlessness, that, to my knowledge, no one has ever succeeded in making it the Genesis They said the lectures was an invitation to Dobson from the orchard persons of the porter tongs. Those of you familiar with the geography of this wretched seaside town, well know that it is bounded on its eastern landward side by a terrific number of origins. The orchard person's social club and community center was situated in a clearing between a pear orchard and a persimmon orchard, and the usual entertainment it hosted one nights of compound pop music and freakish dancing. Past Perhaps that's why Dobson chose to deliver his second lecture on the cutting of grapefruit into segments of equal size in the form of rhyming couplets, to the accompaniment of a glockenspiel. He was not a skilled glockenspiel list, nor did he have much understanding of geometry as those orchard persons discovered, who went home and had and tried to cut their grapefruit the Dobson way. For the third and fourth lectures, Dobson resorted to anecdote and personal reminiscence recounting a series of yams under the headings all the plums I have ever eaten, where I was and what they tasted like, and how I built a coat hanger out of fig stones. All the audiences were dwindling By this time, and only three people turned up to listen to what was to become the most notorious of the lectures, the dialogue between a raspberry and a tangerine. Even those who are most severely critical of the series are forced to admit that Dobson did a tremendous amount of research for this one. He was barely out of the reading room of the pointy town municipal library for weeks on end. poring over books on topics as diverse as fruit Philately, biochemistry, aerodynamics, the peninsula wars, tug boats, flamenco dancing, and the Diet of Worms.

But his claim stove penetrated the very essence of a raspberry and a tangerine, a quite frankly ludicrous. marigold to told him so as they ate breakfast on a hopeless veranda on the morning before the lecture. Dobson's response was to weep great racking sobs in his bowl of Special K. He spent all day making revision revisions to the text, some of which have a certain Jesuit rigor, and by the time he arrived at the clearing between a parent persimmon orchard, he was brimming with confidence. preposterous it may be, but the dialogue between a raspberry and a tangerine remains retains To this day, a kind of magnificent climate read briault. lengthy extract from the lecture form the libretto of a concept album by prog rock Titans, gratuitous on loud. The published addition of six lectures on fruit contained only the text of the first five lectures. Some Dobson is to have argued that the sixth in the series never actually existed, that Dobson had some kind of brain spasm, and that all knowledge of fruit with wipe from his mind Evie van boo did much to spread this story in a foolish conspiracy theory novel, but he overlooks the fact that the pamphleteer was never a man to let ignorance stop him expounding at length on any subject he turned his mind to. What in fact happened was that when Dobson arrived in the clearing on the first Thursday, sorry, what in fact happened was that when Dobson arrived in the clearing on the final Thursday, he found the doors of the social club barred and bolted, and no one in sight. Even the birds had fled from their purchase on the trees that fringed the clearing. Dobson took one look at the mighty iron padlock on the door, reached into his sacral took out the notes of his sixth and final lecture. Some excuse me, some drivel about bananas or marmalade, and tore them into confetti, and cast them into the wind. And then he trudged off into one of the orchards on sugar branch, until pears and persimmons came tumbling. To Earth, and he sat on a tuffet and gorged himself on fruit until he was bloated and bloated. He waddled homewards along the vein out of the orchard, body and brain with fruit bloated.

When I think of fruit, I often think of fruit or as adhesive. And that, in turn, reminds me of a little known story that's told about tiny Enid in which the plucky plump footed Todd devised a method of placating wolves through the agency of fruit based gasps sprays. Yes, yes, I know that a gas spray is a different order of things to a fruit or is adhesive. But given that most fruit rose gums and pastes are made from math, bananas, and the pulp of tangerines, and that tiny Enid gas braid was formed, at least in part by a gas derived from the pulp of bananas and mashed tangerines I think I'm pretty safe ground in forging the link. The weird woods of Whoo hoo Dee booboo, near where tiny Enid spent some time in a boarding house were infested with packs of fierce and dangerous wolves. packs which had savaged any number of innocent Woods hiking types, who blundered foolishly into the weird Woods have a weekend. The heroic infant was not herself a hiking enthusiast, but she had a curious sentimental affection for hikers with their thick woolly socks and social ineptitude. alarmed by reports of wolf attacks, she took it into her head to do something about them. The attacks that is not the reports of the attacks. She sighed. She sighed and left it to someone else to take on the task of correcting the slapdash grammar misspellings and vile prose in which the report written by On the cub reporter on the daily wolf attacks in the woods Clarion were couched tiny in its first impulse was to slaughter the wolves one by one in hand to pour combat, or with pebbles and a catapult or with her trusty blunderbuss. She had got as far as driving towards the weird woods in her souped up jalopy flying a banner in blazoned with the words Death to the wolves in the woods, daubed in blood when she had to break sharply and slow off bumpity bumpity bump into a field to answer an urgent message on her metal Tapping Machine. Tiny Enid was an independent sort of girl, but she had a mysterious mentor, whose advice she often took. It was this mentor who suggested to her that rather than killing the wolf population, she instead seek a method of catering them. And sorry, she instead seek a method of allocating them. I have no particular love for wolves came the tapped out message. But we must be ever mindful of biodiversity, tiny Enid, the earth can support both wolves and hikers, just as it supports both fruit flies and fruit. The diminutive adventurous was not wholly convinced by this analogy, but on this occasion, she deferred to her mysterious mental, possibly because she had been reading up on the Gaia theories of James Lovelock, drawn to them by her interest in the primordial and Sonic Diocese of the ancient Greek Pantheon. Never forget that tiny Enid was a girl of broad education, even if the only book she ever learned by heart was Atlas Shrugged by the postage stamp collector and Rand. falsey is the fruit and fruit fly and our dream may have been it obviously set tiny enough to thinking how fruit might help her poor Kate the wolves of the weird woods. She turned her jalopy round and sped back to town to consult some encyclopedias in the library. Unfortunately, sick headed Andy Burnham had got there before her, and the reference section had been turned into a chill out zone for federal teenagers.

Frank Key  17:50
There was not an encyclopedia to be seen just games consoles and reconstituted patties of meat in bands. Tiny Enid fell the handful of us with pebbles fired from a catapult before heading off to the laboratory of her power Professor Fang, a man who knew a thing or two about fruit and wombs, as he knew about everything else in the universe, everything that is except for hiking and thick woolly socks, for he was an indoor type. I want two things from you, Professor Fang announced tiny Enid in her shrill shouty way. First, a method of protecting wolves with fruit. And second, a way of reprogramming the spongy form gray blob that passes for the brain of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Judy's thick headed ways. I've had to use my stack of pebbles just now. And we'll have to waste parrot precious time collecting further capital ammo, ammo. Who knows how many hikers will be torn apart by wolves in the weird woods of Whoo hoo Dee Woo. While I am scrambling around, but the allotments replenishing my pebble supply. Give me 15 minutes, replied Professor Fang. So it was that in the time it would take to read a chapter of Atlas Shrugged the Mad cat boffin devised both the spray of banana pulp and mash tangerine based gas with which tiny Enid was able to locate the walls and the similar gas derived from tomatoes and conference pairs, which were injected into Andy Burnham's heads through these ears would allow his brain pans to work properly. History and hikers tell us that tiny Enid succeeded in becoming the wolves and making them less savage After the heroic clubfoot infant clumped from one end of the weird woods to the other spraying her gas, not a single hiker was ever attacked again. The Daily wolf in the Davie wolf attacks in the woods Clarion, having no news to report was forced to close down and the cub reporter became a bitter enemy of tiny Enid feeding spurious stories about her to the independence on Sunday, and other downmarket rags. Not the tiny one cared for she was forever after the Campion of bat man and bassy women with maps in protective cellophane projects on lanyards, safe at last to tramp through the weird woods. Whoo hoo Dee woo woo. As for the terrible tale of the burdens brain that is unsuitable for family listening, and we'll have to wait for another more ghastly time.

Finally, this week, we began with Gerard Manley Hopkins and we end with john Ruskin. This is from john Ruskin's force clever Gera a series of letters addressed to the as far as I recall addressed to the workmen of England, or possibly the workers of England and Wales or something like that. This is from the letter letter five. And the only the one thought he regret is that there's no illustration of the work described. So this is roschin. happens on the very day on which I published my last letter, I had to go to the Kensington museum. And there I saw the most perfectly and roundly ill done thing, which as yet in my whole life I ever saw produced by art. It has a tablet in front of it, bearing this inscription. statue in black and white marble Newfoundland dog standing on a serpent, which rests on a marble cushion, the pedestal ornamented with pietta euro fruit in relief, English present century number one. And this is Ruskin again, it was so very right for me the Kensington people having been good enough to number one, the thing being almost incredible in its oneness, and indeed, such a puncture or accident over the iota of missed creation, so absolutely an exquisitely miscreant, that I am not myself capable of conceiving a number two, or three, or any rival shape or association with it whatsoever. The extremity of it unvirtuous consisted observe mainly in the quantity of instruction, which was abused in it. It showed that the person who produced it had seen everything and practiced everything and misunderstood everything they saw. And Miss applied everything they did. I had seen Roman work and floran time work and Byzantine work and Gothic work and misunderstanding of everything had passed through them, as the mud does through earthworms. And here at last was their worm cast of a production. Well, I don't know about you, but I'd like to see a Newfoundland, Newfoundland dog standing on a serpent upon a cushion. I think that would be pretty good. But maybe still, so I'm wearing the one in the monitor Kensington museums. He doesn't say which one? We could probably work it out. The VNA? Possibly, I don't know. Anyway, that's, that's, I think that's it for this week. And yeah, you can always go and visit the hunting yard website. Some of you may be told that it's infected by viruses, but it isn't. And I it really isn't. It's just that one of the virus people hasn't updated their records. But if you don't believe me, then just don't go there. Until you get the all clear. And that's about it. I think anything else to say pansy?

Unknown Speaker  27:46
Well, have we got a minute or two left? To Oh, no. Okay. Well, then I'll finish off this is the final bit of currents theory, leading to the hypothesis that salt enables carbon absorption with the green gooseberry non salt sodium, an inward acting process as in catch flies and pods, whereas sodium salt processes outward, black currents being only skin black, purple, etc. And that's it for me and Mr. Key and good night.

Unknown Speaker  29:21
Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers and wanted to touch matters. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course, I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you. It was the sound of music.
