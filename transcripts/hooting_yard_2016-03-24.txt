resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com Live from London My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. The device stood about shoulder high with a star shaped head, one point of which could be opened. The head would contain the actual brain energy. Its upper body, cylindrical in shape and a gleaming Chrome. How's the output unit through which the brain would react, and also the controlled antennas projecting out on either side gave the look of arms. Its waist was girdled with a ring of rope, Mellotron radiators, for exerting a repulsion force when it wanted to move by rappelling itself away from nearby object. Below the repeller drones was an hourglass shaped power unit housing a solar charged battery. The power unit, in turn, was mounted on a pancake shaped transportation unit. This unit was equipped with both casters, and a sort of Caterpillar crawler arrangement for the contrivance to get about over obstacles. Inside was a gyro stabilizer to keep the whole device upright. Tom felt a glow of pride and eager impatience, as he inspected the device. If it worked as he hoped, this odd creature might one day provide Earth scientists with a priceless store of information about intelligent life on Planet X. And that was a quotation from Tom Swift, and the visitor from Planet X by Victor Appleton. And it appeared on the hooting yard website exactly 10 years and one day ago. And I thought it might be fun this week on some Well, let's not get too carried away. I thought it might be interesting this week to take a trip back in time and see what was going on in hooting yard 10 years ago. And yes, so, in those days, I always used to begin each each day's posted with a quotation from a variety of sources. I'll dial to go back and do that again. Anyway, here's something else that appeared hooting yard all those years ago in March 2006 varias a story told that one night tiny Enid a woke from troubled dreams, went downstairs to get a glass of milk and was amazed when looking out of the kitchen window to see the burning wheel of doom in the field beyond the bottom of her garden. It was turning slowly with hideous creaks it's huge flames licking the sky. Tiny Enid drained her glass, draped a shawl over her dressing gown, slipped into her Uruguayan mountain Ranger boots and unlocked the back door. She walked down to the wicked gate marveling the fierceness of the fire was such that night was banished and the sky as bright as day. As tiny Enid unlatch the gate, her Peck crow hopped along the path to follow her. He could not fly for he was a crippled crumb. Hearing the tap tap tap of his talons on the paving. Tiny Enid turned and whispered you must stay indoors. illya kuryakin it is not safe for you. No sooner were the words out of her mouth that a snaggletooth ruffians stole out of the bushes and hoisted tiny Enid over his shoulder cackling as he carried her off towards the burning wheel of doom.

Let us not judge the snaggletooth Rafi and too harshly. He was a poor half witted hobbled the boy whose moral compass had been skewed growing up as he did during the sorry years of the john major government in which his father had served,

for him children, for he had no hoons nor blankets to swaddle him against a cruel world, indeed, have more compassion for him than tiny Enid showed on that wild and strange night. reasoning that she may as well take advantage of being carried across the mud splattered fields. She waited until I worked three quarters of the way to the burning wheel of doom, before reaching up pushing aside a greasy strand of hair from the snaggletooth Rafi and ear and saying loudly Unhand me now sir, or I shall wring your neck, the snaggletooth Rafi and cackled again and plodded onward. so tiny, Enid swung herself off his shoulder and run his neck. dusting off her hands, she looked back towards the house, to make sure her pet crow that stayed indoors. And then she turned to face the burning wheel of doom. The creeks were that much louder now. The flame is higher and more terrible. Imagine you were side clutching her hand in your fright. And you asked her, What do you see tiny Enid. This is what she might say. This is a strange night and grow stranger still, for I do not see what I thought I would see at the base of the burning wheel of doom. I have heard many tales of it. And always there are peasants dancing in a circle around it. Their brains big dies and by ergot poisoning. And as they reveal by passed from hand to hand, a flagon filled with the blood of ducks and they eat drink of it. And they babble and screech and wail and over to their left should be a band of other peasants, tootling pipes and horns and plucking hops and beating drums. Yet there is no peasantry here, just the creaking burning wheel of doom, a blaze in the night in the field by the lake. Tiny evade would pause for a moment, taking a few steps forward and then add, yet Someone must have sent the snaggletooth Rafi and to abduct me. Who could that be. She reached under her shoulder the pocket of a dressing gown and took out a box of matches and a route. disconcerted to find all the matches in the box spent. She scrolled back through the mud to wherever lifeless body of the snaggletooth Rafi and lay a rifle through his pocket. She found not only a surprisingly expensive cigarette lighter, with which he hastily lit her to route but a calfskin wallet containing cash, a bus pass, creased and crumpled receipts from sorted shops, and as Bo and a photograph of the snaggletooth, Rafi and father, discarding the rest, she gave the snaggletooth Rafi and a kick with her at Uruguayan mountain Ranger boot and studied the snapshot carefully. As the wind blew across the muddy field, tiny he needs student Hirshhorn looking now at the photograph, now at the burning wheel of doom, from one to the other, at first perplexed, then gradually putting two and two together until her eyes lit up with the gleam of certainty. The snaggletooth Rafi and father's face was unclear in the picture. He was turned sideways on shaking hands with john major, who was instantly recognizable Of course, with his tidy gray hair, his spectacles and that curiously distended upper lip area. They had been photographed in front of a hoarding emblazoned with words, which, though only partly visible, suggested something, try them to bat milk. Other clues indicated that the picture had been taken in the snaggletooth Rafi and father's parliamentary constituency. on a Thursday in winter, the penny dropped.

Tiny Enid ran pell mell back to the house, the burning wheel of doom blazing furiously behind her now, stopping I need to check that elior kuryakyn The Crow was nestled safe and sound in his basket. She grabbed her address book and flick through the pages until she found the name she was looking for. glancing at the clock in the hallway, she picked up her metal Tapping Machine and dialed the number, hoping that she would not be too late. He may have had to resign twice in disgraceful circumstances, but she still owed undying loyalty to blind David Blunkett, and she would save him if she could. When, hours later, Dawn broke, the burning wheel of doom over by the lake in the field was sputtering and dying, extinguished by a fresh fall of morning drizzle. illya kuryakin slept peacefully in his crow basket. Tiny Enid sat at her kitchen table, having kicked off her Uruguayan mountain Ranger boots and hung her shawl on the radiator. She was smoking another tree root, and drinking another glass of milk, waiting patiently for the squeak of the newspaper delivery boys bicycle wheels, for the third of the daily manacle on her doormat. anticipating the grove pleasure she would feel when she saw her name once again, as boulder she in Banner headlines, the heroine of the hour.

Does any boy's conscience smite him at my naming the insect? I hope not. I hope you have not been tempted by Satan to do any harm to the little harmless and often useful creatures that cross your path. A butterfly akok chafer A housefly a snail, a caterpillar, a worm. These and all others are God's handiwork and if you could see them through a glass that magnifies very much indeed, you would be more astonished than I can tell you. And that's a quote from kindness to animals, or the sin of cruelty exposed and rebuked by Charlotte, Elizabeth.

One of the more outlandish episodes in Blodgett, frankly debauch life was the time he opened a dancing school or to give it to correct title, Dr. Blodgett terpsichorean Academy for keen young caps. It goes without saying that the rascal was not a doctor of any kind, nor it must be said, Did he have any skills as a dancer, short of flinging himself around a room, knees and elbows a Kimbo, like some ungainly puppet whose handler is having convulsions. Any keen young chap who enrolled in the academy hoping to learn how to Dysport himself with a plum in a quadrille Foxtrot, or even the mashed potato was quickly disillusioned. Dr. Blodgett musical tastes were narrow and intense. He was a devotee of a particularly rigorous form of tonic improvisation, open ended pieces that often lasted for hours on end, performed by earnest young men with incipient beards, whose brows furrowed as they tinkered with deliberately out of tune Viola's trombones bells and thunderous pounding drums. Blodgett devised his own dances to this screeching racket, the most notorious of which was called for no apparent reason, the mustard plaster is about called habit, a record or Blodgett instructions for this dance. survived the Inferno, which laid waste the academy just a month after it opened. Blodgett Of course vanished as soon as he got his hands on the insurance money, and as far as we know, never taught dance again. Plus, what is presented here is a piece of history that could easily have been lost forever. But now you too can learn how to do the mustard plaster by following the notes written by Blodgett himself. One let us call the dancers, basil and ghido. They take up positions facing each other, pointing with their sticks. Basil's stick is cut from a sycamore tree, and has traces of birdlife upon it guidos is made of plastic. The symbolism is clear. By maintaining this stance, staring fixedly at each other, until I snap my fingers. To basil raises his stick upwards and forwards ghido essays a series of 12 jumps and hops and crashes his body as hard as and fast as possible into all four walls of the studio. If his hat falls off, he must replace it in a single fluid motion, full of elegance and grace. He then takes a flying leap to return to his starting point and raises his plastic stick to meet Basil's it is now basil three it is now Basil's turn to jump about and hurl himself at the walls, while ghido stands absolutely still with his stick above his head. Basil should flounce. However, rather than trying to emulate guidos more frenetic movements, he should nudge the wall rather than Buffett them and sashay back to his starting position with an air of insouciance. When he is once again opposite ghido he punches him in the throat for to the insistent clanging of bells ghido leans backwards, balancing his stick on his forehead. Basil takes hold of his neck tie, but not tightly. They rotate a full 360 degrees, pretending to be figurines and a decorative smoke shaker. This takes consummate skill and the difficulty of teaching this movement explains the supplementary fee tacked on to the standard cost of this lesson to be paid in cash.

Five having completed a full rotation, Basil adopts a heroic pose while ghido splays himself on the floor as a snap of my fingers, Basil crumbles and ghido gets up shimmies volt over basil and in rapid succession. Si is a quadrille, Foxtrot and mashed potatoes so low basil will get stays feed. They throw their sticks out of an open window and clutter each other like the lovers on a hilltop during a thunderstorm. A pop from the trombone brings the dance to an end.

Here's another quotation. This one is from life in the gray nunnery at Montreal by Sarah J. Richardson. I'm quite annoyed with myself that when I was posting all these quotations on the heating yard website 10 years 10 long years ago, I didn't give any further details of the the sources like the like the date would be nice, but I have no idea when life in the gray nunnery at Montreal by Sarah J. Richardson was published. I suppose I could look it up and the door opened and a figure representing the Roman Catholic idea of his satanic majesty entered the room. He was very black and covered with long hair. Probably the skin of Some wild animal. He had two long white tusks, two horns on his head, a large clover and a foot and a long tail that he drew after him on the floor. He looked so frightful and recalled to my mind so vividly. The figure that I saw the white nunnery that I was very much frightened. Still, I did not believe it was really a supernatural being. I suspected that it was one of the priests dressed up in that way to frighten us.

For a brief period in the middle of the last century, the phrase two men in a boat trip off the tongue as easily as the more familiar Three Men in a Boat of Jerome K. Jerome comic novel. I'd like to point out, incidentally, as if in brackets, that the K in Jerome K. Jerome stands for clap cup, which is a splendid name, I think. It was a very brief period no more than a fortnight, but during that time, the whole world was abuzz with basil and guidos kropotkin fan Fernald unusually for a dance routine in praise of a totemic anarchist, performed on a rowing boat to the accompaniment of a shore bound orchestra, dance band, light show perfumes and fireworks, it captured the popular mood. Thousands of people, some say millions, trekked to the lake nearby just spinning to witness the spectacle. During its two week run. And basil in ghido, became overnight celebrities formed over in what with retrospect, was an outbreak of mass hysteria. Within days of the final performance, during which an orphan child in the audience became overexcited and was clunked on the head with an oar. The whole thing was forgotten. trudging around the lake today, it's hard to picture the ecstatic scenes that took place here 50 years ago. Now, 60 years ago, of course, there are no longer any boats to be seen, and the lake itself is surrounded by a tall electrified security fence. It is said that monstrous aquatic beings with flippers and tendrils swim and rise below the surface, or that the water is poisoned, or even the lake is haunted by the shade of that orphan child, though she only suffered mild concussion and lived long after the incident. These are just stories believed only by the credulous but what is beyond doubt and readily apparent to anyone who wanders there, as I do, is that the lake is dead, choked by weeds choked to beyond hope. It was so different on the bright summer afternoon in 1951, when basil and ghido disembarked from their hired Shara bank, and stood hand in hand wrapped in wonder before laying out their picnic rug by the jetty freshly graduated from Dr. Blodgett terpsichorean Academy for keimyung camps. The ill matched duo with touring the land, seeking a like pond or other body of water on which to stage their kropotkin fanfare and odd. The spark of the idea came from ghido guidos brain was thick with Bible burning, but he held the Russian anarchist Peter kropotkin in higher steam, having fallen under his spell after reading a translated copy of research on the ice age, an article kropotkin published in notices of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in 1876. Thereafter, impressionable young ghido devoured everything by the Russian he could lay his hands on. When Blodgett demanded that his students choose a subject to interpret via the medium of dance dedeaux was already decided.

Frank Key  24:42
Basil roped in as a collaborator was initially reluctant until shown a photograph of kropotkin whose beard thrilled him as no doubt it would thrill anyone who has the slightest interest in majestic 19th century facial hair. It was basil who brought to their partnership, the rubbing But element, possibly because he misunderstood Blodgett instructions. Basil was by no means stupid, but he was notoriously in attentive. We should be glad it was so far you can imagine the kropotkin fanfare and odd taking place on dry land. By confining the dance to the limited space afforded by a rowing boat, Basil forced himself and ghido to find radical solutions to seemingly intractable problems. Ideal that was as a stage upon which to show kropotkin periods of imprisonment in the Peter and Paul fortress in St. Petersburg, and later in France. The rowing boat had to be wholly reimagined when the dance addressed the anarchist field trips to Finnish and Swedish glasses. Basil and ghido succeeded triumphantly. A fan foreign art can be defined as an ostentatious display. It certainly was. That was the rubbing boat on the lake with the two dancers aboard pirouetting jumping about striking poses and of course, rowing while on the shore, a full orchestra supplemented by a dance band with a slick crooner, playing what can only be described as very frightening music. guidos parents, meanwhile, was scampering around operating the light show, and the complex piping system that sent jet to exotic perfumes wafting over the cross. And yet, and yet, what has been the beginning of a whole new strand of rubbing boat based dance extravaganzas with basil and ghido, the pioneers and masters of the form was in the end, just a flash in the pan. Though they had sold enough tickets to keep the kropotkin fanfare and odd running well beyond its two week run. By just spinny bylaws meant it had to end, in any event, do go now fell victim to the jangles and was carted off to a mysterious clinic hewn into an inaccessible mountainside and basil became a bus conductor. I never worked together again. And that's the end of this week shooting out on the air a trip back in time 2006 when hooting yard was young, well, yeah. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week. I might read some more stuff from 10 years ago, you never know. But I'll be back next week. Thank you very much to john for engineering as ever, and bye bye.
