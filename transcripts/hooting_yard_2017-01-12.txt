Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com on your computer. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air the first show of 2017, which is our in April, we will hit our first 13th anniversary of 13 years of hooting yard, but we're not there yet. And before we get there, we've got some material to get through. He went to an orchard with his charms, and they stole a pallets worth of plums. Then they scampered off to their hideaway as the last light faded from the day. The sky grew black, then darker black. They Sorry. I'm gonna start again because I got something wrong. Um, it's important I get these things right. He went to an orchard with his chums and they stole a Punnett worth of plums. Then they scampered off to their hideaway as the last light faded from the day. The sky grew dark, then darker black. They transferred the plums into a sack. Then they tumbled out of their hideaway tent, and around the town in the night they went depositing plums from door to door. mystery that was against the law. For in that town plumbers had been banned, as elsewhere in that plumbers land. According to the Kings decree, Kim Kim Carew, Kim Kim Curie, the king looks just like Dick Van Dyke plums were a fruit he did not like. Why then you ask did he allow the orchard trees bow upon bow to sprout so many Carlsbad plums let us ask the little charms. But oh, they vanished in the night. Now they're completely out of sight. Oh, the hills and far away as dawn breaks on a brand new day. And townsfolk find plums on their stoops. They greet them with shrill cries and whoops, and hide them quick before King Klaus comes on his round from house to house. If he finds a plum, his rough will wax and cause umpteen heart attacks. So hide your plumbers Well, folks of the town till human voices wake you and you drown. The theme of this week show is plums. So if you're averse to plums, look away now. It occurs to me that looking away will not save you from hearing further about plums. So look away and stuff cotton volunteer is, but only if you're averse to plums if he like plums, you may find much in this episode of hooting yard to enjoy a recipe next. For this recipe I read you will require a bag of frozen crinkle cut oven chips, six cans of sculpture a turn it a parsnip, a pallet of Carlsbad plums and the head of a pre slaughtered pig. So I went to the shops and bought a bag of frozen crinkle cut oven chips six cans of squirrel joke or turn it a parsnip and a pallet of calve bag plums. obtaining the head of a pre slaughtered pig proved more difficult. Not one among the parade of shops I frequented had any such thing in stock. The butchers, which was my best hope, had it shut us down at a scribbled sign posted on the shutters announcing closure due to rampant infectious disease. Though it did not specify whether this referred to the butcher himself, water his supply of meat

Sitting on a municipal bench eating one of the coals, bad plums. I wonder if I might make a vegetarian version of the dish using a pig's head fashioned for marzipan. But my skills as a sculptor or molder have atrophied, since the heady days of my youth are the Institute for sculpting and molding. And I was not convinced my efforts with marzipan would yield anything that looked remotely akin to the head of a pig. By the time I had eaten the second Carlsbad plum, it was clear to me that I would have to go in search of a pre slaughtered pig and remove it head. It is surprisingly difficult in this day and age to find a dead pig in a small town. I wandered into the countryside, keeping my eyes peeled, peering into bogs and ditches. This proving fruitless I made my way to the top of a bluff from where I could see for miles around. But climb was onerous, and when I reached the summit, I was thirsty, so I opened one of the cans of sculpture and downed it in a single glog. gazing out across the countryside, I shouted, dead pig dead pig, Come out, come out wherever you are. I hoped by this means to coax into view a peasant pushing a wheelbarrow in which rested a pre slaughtered pig. Such a sight is not uncommon in the countryside. Also, I am given to understand from my reading of various bucolic texts, in the pauses between my repeated shoutings I felt that wondering if an urban person could be a Bane Was there an equivalent countryside quality in which a rustic person could be rusty? I had no opportunity to find out for after an hour or so the top of a bluff does a single peasant had appeared. The day was hot, and I noticed that my bag of frozen crinkle cut oven clips was almost entirely thought. I was also conscious that I had depleted my stocks of both Carlsbad plums and sculpture. Unless I returned home in haste, I would end up consuming all the non pig's head ingredients for the recipe, and my day would be wasted. I skittered down from the bluff like a gambling lamb, and headed back through the fields of muck towards town. All the while I was racking my brains trying to think of an acceptable substitute for the pre slaughtered pig's head. What did I have in my cupboard? Pink wafer biscuits, peas, a bowl of for us a jar of pickles, several contaminated cocktail sausages, blah, blah. Somehow none of these seem quite right, nor even remotely suitable. If I was to vary the recipe, then the least I could do was to use something's head. By now I was nearing town, so I looked around me with fresh eyes. All I had to do was spotted living creature sees it slaughter it, remove it head and pop the head into my pity bag along with the bag of now unfrozen crinkle cut oven chips to turn up the parsnip and what was left of the cans of sculpture and the cove bad plums both further depleted on account of peckish, pneus and thirst during my long countryside Krug. There were plenty of creepy crawlies to be seen, but they're tiny, tiny heads were hardly fit for purpose. Just as I was losing hope, I came upon a pond at the edge of which a toad was flopping about with a cry of inhuman savagery I fell upon it seized it and strangled it. Then I bit off the head, spat it out, wrapped it in a sheet of greaseproof paper, I happen to have a my pity bag and carried it home. I would not be able to follow the recipe with 100% accuracy, but I felt confident that I could knock together a toothsome sapper. Alas, I did not consider that the toad I pre slaughtered might be one of those toads that is highly toxic, but so it was, as I write these words, I'm shaking violently, sweating, vomiting, and my own head has swelled to twice its usual size. I fear that was I tucked into an hour ago, after an exciting time at the cutting board will prove to be my last supper.

exciting news. Tarleton is back on his balcony. He's eating a plum. It's a Carlsbad plum. He gazes across the city and the wasteland into the distance where the pinkie rossett peaks of the pinky Russet mountains shimmer in the haze from one of thousands is dangles a piratical earring but there is no piratical parrot on his shoulder. He has though, acquired since last we met him a wooden leg. telethons brief we might recall was to gouge and Hugh gougeon Hugh he did heroically losing a leg in the process. But he did not complain. He showed fortitude. I was encamped at Fort whitey he said to himself, and then at Fort toity. So it only is only meat that in forts I show fortitude. No wonder Tarleton was showered with Petunia petals by adoring peasant. there remained a few petals in his hair for a long time since he shampooed it is a long time to since last he stood upon this balcony, eating a plum. It was so long ago that he only dimly remembers. more vivid are the memories of Fort hoity with it ostrich ears and bandages and zinc and fought toity with champions arrayed along the crenellations and games of spit in the gutter. It was between fought that towels and lost his leg to a crocodile. In the Middle Ages returning Crusaders brought with them the embalmed bodies of crocodiles, which were wrapped in chains and hung from the ceilings of cathedrals. Talton did not think of his gouging and hewing as a crusade, but it was, Oh, it was he spits out the plum stone into the palm of his hand, makes a fist and taking care of Elaine tosses it over the edge of the balcony down into the shallow pool around the fountain. How many Carlsbad plump stones lie there, barely submerged. He has never once missed a toss. Tarleton turns and withdraws into his chamber. His head is full of squeaking imaginary backs.

Much of what I read on this show is fiction and A lot of listeners will know. But sometimes, I like to read a little bit of autobiography. And this next piece is wholly autobiographical. So living from my chalet down to the post office, I stopped short when I saw the edge of a crevasse a monkey encased in a block of ice. Now, I am no expert on monkeys. And I wasn't sure what kind of Monkey It was. It was between a quarter and a third of the size of an average human if such a thing exists. I made a note with a propelling pencil in my drafting pad to remind me of the precise location, then carried on down to the post office at the foot of the mountain. I transacted my business, this distance in time, I cannot remember what it was on my way to the funicular railway station, stopping off to buy a pastry snack and a bag of plums. I told the conductor that I wanted to alight before my usual chalet level stop. He raised one eyebrow and gave me a quizzical look, but dented my ticket with his metal ticket dinner. Without further comment. The windows of the carriage was steamed up so I could not see a thing outside. I met my pipe and we began to Creek slowly upwards. I got off when the conductor gave me the nod and trudged over to the class. In my absence, the block of ice had not thought one iota if anything, it did frozen to even more adamantine solidity. Not surprising, given the foul weather. The sun had been obscured by clouds and mist and bad air for three or four days on the trot. I tapped my badminton knuckle on the ice, but of course, the monkey inside did not stir. How could it it too, was frozen solid. My first thought had been to melt the ice in situ, releasing the monkey dangerously close to the crevasse. If upon regaining consciousness, it bounded off in the direction of the gaping chasm, and looked as if it might plunge to its death. I hope to forestall such a calamity by tempting it with plums or pastry. But while aboard the funicular railway, I had become peckish extinguished my pipe, and eaten half the plums and the entire pastry. I had to rethink my plans, it would make far more sense to hold a block of ice up to my chalet and to melt it there. This would have the advantage that I could immediately put the frozen monkey in a place of comfort my sofa or my bed, so that when it eventually awoke, it would be less likely to panic and plunged down a cravat. The problem now was how to transport the block of ice up the unforgiving mountainside. Monkeys I knew were banned from the funicular railway and with good reason. I was barely strong enough to clamber up hill unencumbered, let alone shoving Sisyphean fashion, a block of ice containing a monkey ahead of me. For one wild moment, I envisioned a helicopter swooping down rope dangling to ferry my cargo to the chalet. But of course, the mountain and its hinterland for miles in every direction, were a no fly zone, according to directive number 17. What I had always found puzzling, incidentally, was the impossibility of finding out what on earth directives numbers one to 16 were, nobody seemed to know or at least nobody was willing to tell. Then I remembered that I had in my cupboard in the chalet a very lengthy length of sturdy chain. It should be possible to perfect one end of this to the block of ice, and to devise a contraption which with minimal effort for me, for example, dainty movements of my little fingers would drag the block of ice up to my chalet satisfied, I let my pipe and waited for the funicular railway to resume my journey up and home.

While I waited, I paired the monkey inside the ice, or as much of it as I could see, which in truth was very little. Sometimes ice is crystal clear, but this block was somewhat more opaque. It gave the monkey a blurred quality, as if viewed by a catastrophic Lee myopic person or seen in a dream I had often dreamed of such monkeys blurry, Ill defined and ominously still, it had never occurred to me to wonder what these dreams might mean, as if they could possibly mean anything. Starving has always seemed to me a far better guide than Freud. That is why I have a hammer and sickle emblem nailed to the door of my chalet to announce my stance to any visitors, thus averting the risk of futile conversations. And the funicular railway carriage arrived on schedule, and I clambered aboard, and I smoked my pipe and ate the remainder of the plums and I alighted at my usual stop, and I went home, and I devised a contraption to drags a block of ice up the mountain slope, and I fetched the chain from the cupboard, and I fixed one end of it to the bracket on the contraption, and gave it a hefty tug to ensure it was secure. And I started to make my way slaloming back down the mountain, paying out the train behind me until I came to the block of ice with the monkey inside it. And I wrapped the train round and round and round the ice, and gave it a hefty tug to ensure it was secure. And I returned to the funicular railway stop to wait for the carriage to take me back up hill, and then I began to feel peckish again, and instead of going home, I slalom down to the village and bought another pastry and another bag of plums, and I sat on a stone bench next to a statue of Stalin and scuffed the pastry and the plums and when I was replete, I fell into a dose right there on the bench, and I dreamed of a monkey blurry ill defined and ominously still. I can hardly believe that 50 years have passed since that day.
