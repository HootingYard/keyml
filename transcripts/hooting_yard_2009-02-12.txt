Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. Sorry, I wasn't with you last week, but I think I may slowly be falling apart. Anyway, I'm here now, this week, I want to read a selection of interconnected stories. What the interconnection between them will become apparent to astute listeners. And I hope that there's time to do all of them in half an hour. If there isn't, well, we'll just have to carry on next week. So without further ado, here is the beginning of the is the first story in the interconnected set of stories. In his later years, Blodgett amassed a collection of inky punk. I'm going to start again because I've already messed up the first line. In his later years, Blodgett amassed a collection of inky Puck stampings kept in an album bound in the start stiffened fleece of a lamb. The fleece was spotted with unexplained bloodstains, which Blodgett made no attempt to remove. He could have used a Peyton's blood stain eradication spray glue, as manufactured by Don Federico, his royal and ancient Portuguese spray and paste company, but he chose not to boffins in our lab, were recently given the opportunity to scrape minuscule quantities of the blood off the binding, when they subjected it to test they were able positively to identified as the blood of a fruit bat. Curious indeed, but no more curious than much else about Blodgett, later years. In his new television series, The pitiful whimpering of a soul in torment. Celebrity historian Simon seabag stimmung bag examines in detail the final decade of Blodgett life, and on earth some startling startling fact. I'm sorry, startling fact, although among them are a number of Blodgett Starling collisions. It seems unlikely that a man could collide with a Starling on repeated occasions as per being struck by lightning, stumbling bag, as it has at his fingertips and massive, convincing evidence, including owner's illogical records, accident reports and ticket stubs from showbiz bird displays. He also gives us a remarkable account of the time Blodgett decamped to a large area neglected to keep a log of his stay there, and upon returning home spent some six weeks Dementedly chopping logs with a very sharp axe. Despite being over 80 years old. He's aim carted the entire supply of chopped up logs back to the laundry or dumped them outside the door and kept a log in his journal of their gradual depredation through theft, and rot. There are other distinctively blodger tech glimpses when hurrying bricks on the brain tormented scribblings on parchment regarding supe Starling collisions missed misted glass obscuring decisively important bus timetable, sings, chewed and spat out intimations of mortality, imitations of Christ intimacy with a mute milkmaid delusional vampires card games ditch digging, reading aloud a fiery flying roll by Ibiza cop to an audience of stunned Potter's as a potter is encountered in hospital corridors smashed up lobster pots, a zest for crumpled things. The historian takes us through it all, at a pace, sometimes gentle and other times hectic and occasionally incomprehensible, unless one is already familiar with the material. This is stimmung bags way as viewers have come to expect from his previous TV documentaries, on topics such as collisions in the sky, and on starlings.

For most of us, though, whether or not we're students of Blodgett, it's the attention paid to the collection of inky Puck stampings that's truly revolutionary. Indeed, I had no idea that Blodgett maintain such a collection, nor that he kept it with such uncharacteristic carrying a starched different lamb's fleece bound album stained with the blood of a fruit bat. Again, one has to admire the way stone bag marshals the evidence a particularly difficult task when one considers how many similar collections was destroyed after the coup which brought the new regime into power. There will be younger viewers who have never known about inky PUK stampings, let alone that people will use to collect them. Of course, few were kept in albums as magnificent as Blodgett, it being far more common in those days to shove them haphazardly into cardboard pouches or discarded agricultural sacks. What shines most brightly in this excellent television series is the almost inhuman concentration with which blowdry attended his collection, pairing at the stampings for at least three hours every day, no matter what else was going on in his life, or in the world at large. It's remarkable that on the day, loving you by mini repetition hit number two in the British Singles Chart. Blodgett spent at least nine hours, not only preparing his inky Puck stampings, but rearranging them within his album, getting through an entire packet of stampings hinges, each one torn in half as well as his usual habit. I think it says something about the man that he did not even collide with a Starling on that day, and it says something about Simon seabag stimmung bag that he has crafted such a long, blurry black and white television documentary series with a deafeningly loud, yet simultaneously muffled soundtrack, to which one must listen with one's ears pricked up and one's mouth hanging open, drooling into a pewter pot held by one's unpaid companion on the balcony of a sanatorium upon which the snow falls and does not melt.

Frank Key  07:05
drooling into a pewter pot held by my unpaid companion on the balcony of the sanatorium upon which snow was falling snow which showed no sign of melting, and I realized it was going to be a hard winter. My companion was a deaf mute, and I could have used sign language to communicate this insight to her. But I was wearing sick woolly mittens against the cold so I let it pass. She could not lip read my language. And even if she could, my beard is now so majestic that my lips are thoroughly obscured. It further occurred to me that in a hard winter, I might perish on this balcony covered in snow. Well, I thought worst things happen at sea. It's a notion I've often clung to for comfort. But God knows, given some of the calamities that have blasted me over the years, I do wonder just how much worse things could have been. Had I been aboard a boat or a raft. The idea that maritime disasters were worse than anything that could possibly happen to me on land, was instilled in me at my mother's knee and kept me shore bound even in the teeth of press gangs blandishments and wanderlust. The Press gangs were the hardest to overpower Of course, lumbering brutes flailing cutlasses at me as I staggered drunkenly from a dark side Tavern at dawn. Lucky for me to leave it in my cups. I have a gaze that could wither a row of hollyhocks. I mean that literally, it was a trick I picked up from a mountebank in a fairground tent. And when I deploy sparingly, would it have helped me to face down in Perelman at sea? I will never know it's much too late for me to go sailing now. how late it is, how late. That was the title of a book by a swear a Scotsman I record a book that won a prize. I doubt he had a clue what he was talking about. I stare at the falling snow from my balcony drooling into a pot. And I think I'm the one who knows what late means. The puter drop pot is a memento from the long ago morning of my life. It belonged to my mother as it had belonged to my grandmother, and I think to my great grandmother, all of whom kept buttons in it. Women of those eras I mashed thousands upon thousands of buttons, never discarding a single one. into the pewter pot, a button would go with all its fellow buttons. When the pot came into my possession, I stuck it in a cupboard for years. Then when my death mute, unpaid companion, signaled to me that she needed a container to catch my drool. I thought it in the cupboard and found it. I tossed the buttons all of them over the balcony. Different balcony the one in the home I was ejected from but below that balcony to lay snow deep and crisp and even, and the buttons fell there and we're soon buried under another fall. And just as the snow here is unlikely to melt for we're so high on the air is so cold and thin, so to the snow at home will never ever melt. It is a frozen place where I come from, and very far from the sea

is a frozen place where I come from and very far from the sea. The first word I ever spoke with icicle and I was in my late 20s before I ever heard talk of tugboats and barnacles and offshore gas fields. The idea that solid ice could simply melt away was so foreign to me that when I first saw it happen it really Fried my wig daddy Oh, as the hepcat would say, not being a hepcat I screamed and swooned. My ghoulish uncle Lars grabbed me by the mitten one day and dragged me off with him on one of his joints. We wore snowshoes to negotiate our way across the freezing frozenness resting while in the shadow of an immense ice mountain. Uncle Lars clamped his pipe in his drawers, and took from a pocket of his in swaddling furry wrappings a box of matches. After lighting his pipe, he held the still lit Lucifer against a crag of ice, and I watched as it melted and dripped and vanished away as if it had never been there at all. It was as if the world I'd grown to understand had no underpinnings was my Figment. And so my brain collapsed, and I screamed and swooned. So severe was my trauma that I was chained up in what we call the Mad cabin for months on end. My recuperation was slow, but I gradually began to understand the concept that ice and water and steam were but different forms of the same substance. I cannot overestimate the importance to my recovery of a pamphlet I was given on the day when one of my chains was removed. It was called child be thunderstruck, as your tiny brain copes with the notion that ice and water and steam are but different forms of the same substance. The author's name I learned was Dobson. Sadly, the pamphlet has long been out of print. Such was my first encounter with the 20th century's Titanic pamphleteer, an encounter which led from initial enthusiasm to wild over excitement to mono mania. I became so demented about Dobson that I risk being kept in the Mad cabin for years and years. Fortunately, on a visit one day, Uncle Lars taught me to hide my light under a bushel. Not literally Of course, for that would have been a very foolish thing to do. And despite his clumping weirdness, Lars was no fool. But I learned to temper my Dobson zest when the waters were lurking, and went so far as occasionally asking to take delivery of works by other writers such as Zadie Smith and column Toy Bin. Needless to say, I never actually read such um, Dobson is trash, but made use of the books as pamphlet camouflage, or as handy things to chuck up the wall with my free hand chucking things at the wall was my other great leisure activity in those days, and remain so. It's a great pity that Dobson has so little to say on the subject. And yet there were so many, many topics to which the pamphleteer turned his attention. I found that as I worked my way through the cannon, I became obsessively interested in whatever Dobson was writing about to the exclusion of anything else, even if the subject is the pamphlet I've been reading the day before. That being so I often wonder how different my life might have been If, on the day I was eventually unchained and ejected from the Mad cabin into the frozen waste of my homeland. I'd been reading something other than dogs and short, strange, brilliant pamphlet, why those let loose from Mad cabins should immediately up sticks and settled at a seaside resort.

Frank Key  14:47
Before I up sticks and settled at a seaside resort, I said farewell to Uncle Lars. For old times sake, we went on a jaunt he was more ghoulish than ever and had exchanged his passion. For some sort of newfangled, smoking contraption, into which he crammed fistfuls of disgusting, blackened vegetable matter, and sent out blooming coils of me asmik fog. We stopped again beneath the great ice mountain, and Uncle Lars again struck a match for his smoke. And again, he held the match against the ice, and I watched it melt away. But I know the screen nor swooned that I had read my Dobson, and I knew what was afoot. Uncle Lars knew that I knew and he flashed me a conspiratorial grin. For an instant I thought I might scream at that, for the grin of love seldom seen is never forgotten, and it has sent many dribbling Greenie to the Mad cabins. I quailed at the sight of it, certainly, but it did not utterly undo me. Not only because I'd seen it once before, and was that inoculated against it? But also because yet again, I could call on Dobson having read his pamphlet on terrifying facial expressions. I grinned back at laws as best I could, knowing that I might never see him again. And he puffed the mat out and handed it to me as a memento. Look there on the mantelpiece of my seaside chalet between the toy binnacle and the heap of sand. You see that half burned Mac. That's the match that was my parting gift from uncle Lars. Sometimes I put it in my pocket, and I go down to the promenade and I lean upon the railings and stare out to see, as I stare, I held the match delicately in my fingers and the whole world makes sense. I know that all the water I can see was once ice until it was made hot by untold billions of matches lit and the flame where it were upon it became the C and the C two will vanish. It will boil and seeds and become vapor just as Dobson for told.

Frank Key  17:28
And the C tube will vanish. It will boil and see them become vapor just as I foretold. Dobson wrote it is the final sentence on the final page of the final pamphlet in the notorious series of so called cosmological blurting things he composed during the space age. Upon publication, these essays met with a level of derision comparable to the reception given to Philip Gossett on fat loss 1857 but at least God the Father of father and son 1907 by Edmund Goss had a coherent, preposterous argument to make, trying to reconcile his scientific observations of the fossil record with his Christian beliefs as a member of the crackpot Plymouth brethren. Dobson on the other hand in his blurting makes no sense whatsoever. It's as if he's issuing a series of grand statements about the nature of the cosmos, past present and future, which are wildly contradictory, bonkers and incomprehensible. He even his prose loses its shine in some of these pieces, where he chanters on about, say, stars and gravel, endlessly repeating himself, and it seems quite forgetting the niceties of grammar and punctuation. marigold Chu tried to dissuade the pamphleteer from making a complete fool of himself, fearing that what reputation he had would be damaged irreparably by the blurting. She hid all his pencils in her mysterious cabinet. Dobson outwitted her by ingratiating himself with a charcoal burner, who gave him a couple of sticks of charcoal with which he scribbled away until marigold Chu discovered them and ground them to obliteration with a pestle and mortar. Dobson hurried back to the declivity in the hills where he had come upon the charcoal burner, but the man had vanished, and in his place was a sparkly eyed dwarf all dressed in green, with bells upon his cap, and a startling affinity with rabbits and hares. He was like a figure from a folk tale, and Dobson wondered if in that case, it might be persuaded to magic up some writing instruments out of thin air, perhaps as a reward for answering a riddle or three But the dwarf was merely a dwarf, albeit a flamboyant one who was fond of rabbits and hares. So the pamphleteer trudged back home in a foul temper. Entering the kitchenette, he rifled through the cupboards, poured all the breakfast cereals out of their cartons into a sack and retreated to his study. with scissors and a tube of Brian Ito's proprietary extra sticky gum for pasting purposes. Trademark Dobson painstakingly cut out words from the cereal packaging, arrange them into sentences and stuck them into his notebook. Not surprisingly, the sections of the blurting, which resulted a particularly dim witted, he quickly exhausted his supply of cardboard word and thumped his head repeatedly upon his escritor in the ravages of despair. At this stage marigold two tried to tug Dobson's head out of the cloud, and fix his attention upon other mundane topics. Why don't you give the cosmological blurting arrest Dobson and write a pamphlet about an everyday subject? Think what you could make of something like oh, I don't know, a sack full of mixed breakfast cereals, or a dwarf with rabbits and hares. Those are the sorts of topics that are screaming to be written about I would have thought and who better to address them than you. Dobson merely banged his forehead upon his desk again. That night, the pamphleteer lay on his back in the middle of a field staring up at the stars, the mania was still upon him. He had come to the field towards dusk armed with a paperback botanical guide, wondering if he might find a clump of isatis tinctoria or wood or glass them from which he could eat some blue dye to dog further blurting things. But he had left it late in the day, and there was not light enough for him to identify with certainty any of the clumps of foliage in the field. And so he stared up at the stars all night, barely blinking, transfixed. They found him in the morning flat on his back

soaked in June. There were four of them toggled out in the apparel of hikers, each of them Beardy and bug eyed and carrying ruck sacks packed with enigmatic cargo, measuring instruments and metallic meters with dials and Coddington lenses and Bakelite blocks from which dangled wires and clips and Hooters and McKenzie beams and scanners or nozzles. They had mapped to and big foldout diagrams and logbooks full of arcane jottings. And they had pencils. Dobson woke up. Good morning, he said to the quartet of lanky eccentrics looming over him, And who might you be? Weezer ouisa said the lanky is busiest most bug eyed one other brethren of Plymouth. Not to be confused I hasten to add with the Plymouth Brethren, a sect of krisztian crackpots were a man of science, man of parasites of super sons of Uber science. Our project is to untangle the knot of nature to lay bare the secret workings of the universe. That is why our rucksacks contained in our array of paraphernalia, the likes of which will not be found in the rucksacks of ordinary mortal hiking persons here, take a look. And so saying he plumped his rucksack on the ground, and unfastened its flaps and gave Dobson a glimpse of wonders. This is very interesting, said the pamphlet here addressing the four of them as one for now they were huddled so close together that they might have been a single beast with eight legs and four Beardy heads. I am Dobson the pamphleteer and I am currently engaged in a series of blessings which tally uncannily with the aims of your project. Perhaps we should join forces. I see you have pencils. That's it was that rather than returning home that morning Dobson through in his lot with the brethren of Plymouth. for three weeks he lived with them at their encampment a stone's throw from the declivity where he had met both the charcoal burner and the dwarf. And with the aid of borrowed pencils, he completed his color cosmological blurting things. When his work was done. He went back to marigold to in triumph. Of course, when the pieces were published and comprehensively demolished by the pamphlet reviewing critics, Dobson's reputation suffered, just as marigold Chu had said it would. I'm not gonna lie I told you so. sort of person. Dobson she said one morning as she was spreading marmalade substitute on a potato based smacking treat. But have you seen what it says in today's daily keep up to speed with the latest pamphleteering shenanigans? No. Let me read it to you. Here quote, Dobson's reputation will take a long time to recover from the plunge into the uttermost depths it has taken since he published his so called cosmological blurting these witless works evidence of a weak brain. The best thing Dobson can do is to go into hiding for a decade or so, perhaps by taking up a janitorial post in some far flung place like Winnipeg. Of course, that's exactly what Dobson did do. marigold crew did not join him, she stayed to hold the fort. It was a big fort with delightful crenellations and many flags, and it had the shiny, highest portcullis outside of Navarre.

I'm not going to be able to complete the the set of stories that I began at the beginning of the show, because there isn't time this week. And in fact, we've got to come to an end now. But before we go, I just want to mention that you can now follow hooting yard on Witter. As you may already know Witter is an exciting new social networking service, designed for people with pea sized brains who want to shrink them further, even unto the point of invisibility. The idea is that every 50 years Witters right on account of their doings in beautiful, if somewhat clogged handwriting on sheets of vellum and roller sheets up and seal them with wax and carry them around the countryside, stopping every now and then to a cost of wayfair or a peasant because I shove into a ditch and home by then read the winter aloud and at length. I think you'll all agree that this is a splendid new way to get the hooting yard message across to folk far and wide. which shouldn't be confused with a similar service, recently popularized by the most intelligent life form ever walk the earth, otherwise known as Stephen Fry, who cleverly uses it to demonstrate his command of childish scatological exclamations to the delight of a thankful nation. That's all from hooting out for this week. Bye bye
