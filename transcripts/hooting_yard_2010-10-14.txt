Good evening This is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key resonance 104 point four FM. Back in the studio now, after a diet, the frieze Art Fair. Apparently I'm going to be at the frieze Art Fair myself on Saturday. But what I will be reading, I have no idea yet because it hasn't been written. Keep an eye on the resonance website shedule b may find out I can't even remember what time I'm on on Saturday. Anyway, enough of all that, and over the last few weeks on the show, we've been going through the alphabet, and this week. In half an hour, I think we should have time to complete it. So we're resuming our alphabet at the letter W. If you're a certain type of folk singer, or Vicar, or countryside Rambler, you will as likely as not be wearing a jumper or sweater or pullover made of wall. It may conceivably be a polo neck. you more than anyone will know that there is a good wall and there is bad wall. I would go so far as to say that in the matter of wall, there is no middle ground, no gray area. Either the wall is good, or it's bad. And there's an end and if your jumper or sweater or pullover has been knitted from goodwill, you should count your blessings. Depending on where you live good wall can be hard to come by. You may have had to send away to some far distant wooly apparel concern to have one of their catalog items delivered to you through the mails in a packet. The cost of transportation and packaging will have added to the basic price of your chosen jumper or sweater or pull over. But the outlays justified when it's guaranteed that the network was done with good wall. But whoa bit I do if for some reason you're forced to wear something made from bad wall. Bad wall comes from bad sheep. They may be diseased or repugnant or unseemly, or even all three that does not stop unscrupulous shares from sharing the wool from them and selling it onto equally unscrupulous wool merchants who in turn have it processed and knitted into garments? It is both sad and astounding what reserves of human skill can be deployed into making something out of bad wall spotting a garment on a market stall or for sale from the Barrow of a Barrow boy, it may not be immediately apparent whether the wall is good wall or bad wall. It may not even become evident when you put it on pulling it over your head and inserting your arms and tucking it about yourself. But if it's made from bad wall, it will contaminate you as surely as night follows day. That's the thing about garb and knitted from bad wall. The knitting was bad and the garbage is bad because of the bad wall and disporting it upon your frame. sashaying along the boulevards of your photo bog, it will make you bad too. It's a wonder that bad wall has not been made illegal. Perhaps there are happy lands where that's the case is that on a pleasing thought, a happy land where all wool is good, and none of it bad. Alas, it's an impossible dream. For there will always be bad sheep and bad Shearer's and unscrupulous merchants and ne'er do well traders and Barrow boys. Hence, if you're wearing good wool, I repeat, Count your blessings, count them until Kingdom Come and then count them over again. And if you're wearing bad wool, reflect upon the circumstance, ask what you have done to deserve bad wall. It is likely that you have brought the bad wall upon yourself through your own contamination for bad attracts bad in persons and wall as in other phenomena of the boundless universe.

So we move on to x and it will become apparent what x stands for. If you listen it's one of those words where the x sounds more like a Zed. But listen out and I'm sure it will become apparent. Towards midnight as I crept through the graveyard, the sky was pitch black, the stars obscured by clouds. My top Ah, lamp shed only meager light, and I stumbled many times over the rough and ravaged ground. Somewhere an owl hooted. I hooted in reply mischievously, for even inside macabre circumstance. I've retained my joie de vive, what do you have to don't you when surrounded by doom and death and memento mori perched on a promontory overlooking the awful sea, the graveyard was whipped by winds, how they how old so so many of the tombstones have toppled over the years, over the centuries, and the salt wind had crumbled them as I had hooted at the owl, so I howled at the wind. I hooted. I howled, and then I chuckled insouciantly like the dandy I can be at my best, and I held my lamp aloft as I peered into the black. Somewhere here about was the ossuary, where bones were stacked in numerable. Abandoned within the vault, not a single bone, I'd been told had a tag that might identified that could have led to it rejoining the other bones with which once as a skeletal structure, it had looked inside a body with breath and blood and life. Lonely abandoned bones lay in stacks in the ossuary, and here I come at a dead of night.

On Thursday, during a rainstorm, I took shelter in the library. Unlike most modern libraries, this one still had some books in it. by some miracle they've not been consigned in their hundreds of thousands to a line pit. browsing the shelves, I lit upon a tome and titled The Academy of armory, or a storehouse of Armory and blaze on containing the several variety of created beings and how born in coats of arms, both foreign and domestic, with the instruments used in all trades and sciences, together with their terms of art. Also, the etymologies, definitions and historical observations on the same explicated and explained according to our modern language, very useful for all gentlemen, scholars, divines and all such as desire any knowledge in arts and sciences, by Randall home, it was over 300 years old, having been published in 1688. And if the slip pasted in the frontispiece was to be believed, no one had borrowed it from the library since 1819. The year john Ruskin was born. Gosh, I thought sweeping a hand through my terrific hairstyle. Now, armouries, I can take or leave, but I have ever been fascinated. Sorry. Got a bit of a frog in my throat. I'm going to start that again. Gosh, I thought sweeping a hand through my terrific hairstyle. Now, armories, I can take or leave, but I have ever been fascinated to the point of loosened bowels by blazons. It is the kind of chat by an Simply put, don't ask me why. Better by far, I'd say to be a blazer Ernest, than a Vin Kenya. In any case, I'm only half Flemish. Later, perhaps I will tell you about the other half of my ancestry. both halves are mostly bones now, bones rotten and crumbled to dust. But then that is true of every man, jack avus, isn't it? So it's hardly worth saying. I propped the home turn on a lectern. And as the downpour continued to beat relentlessly upon the smudge and grubby windows, and the sky darkened, I leafed through the pages. The book smelled for some reason of vinegar. What could the reason be? I picture to myself a 19th century blaze inist. Perhaps or rather Kaddish one in Regency trues tossing the book into a trough of vinegar as he salads to Pump room. Did they have troughs filled with vinegar in those days for a purpose beyond my Ken I knew not. And Randall home wasn't going to tell me. He was going to tell me about armories and blaze ons. But he was also going to tell me something else something of great import for this present essay. What he told me in the failing light at the lectern in the library in Libya, three page 429 paragraph one was this raspa torium rasping hooks, scraping instruments to shave and scrape filthy and scaly bones. It's called also, Zeiss. I knew what I had to do. I slammed the book shot to replace it on the shelf where I found it, and I strode No, I missed out into what I thought was rain, only to have maryada tiny hail stones pinging onto my bonds. As luck would have it. There was a surgical instrument and appliance shop bang next door to the library. I ducked Inside Out of the Hale and made immediate purchase of a Zeiss. What do you want it for? Ask the shopkeeper, a surly sought whose parents I surmised had never coddled him for the scraping of filthy and scaly bones. I cried using my theatrical training. all well and good, he replied somewhat crestfallen. I think he was less interested in making a sale than in outwitting me for some skewed psychological frolic of his own. Wrap it for me, I commanded with pastry paper, and butchers Sterling. He did as he was bid, a broken shopkeeper.

I took my disaster home and waited for the darkness to fall. Then I changed into garb appropriate for the practice of creeping among toppled tombstones, and I stole out of my chalet and climbed towards the promontory, and I scaled the graveyard gates and made for the ossuary, the Zeiss clutch tightly in my dainty, dainty yellow big gloved hand.

Why is for yachtsman Excuse me. Some years ago, were one strolling in a marina or a harbor, it would be quite common to hear a bunch of tinies chanting a rhyme as they danced hand in hand in a ring around a collapsed and comatose seaside salt. Sea, the drunken yachtsman vomit on his blazer, it is mine here blockman xapian with your taser. There are several problems with this and we're indebted to Arturo himmelfarb Bob, the noted collector of children's gruesome seaside songs, who recently published a research paper in which he tabulates the perplexities on an abstruse graph with pointy bits and no doubt expensive for color printing. As is the way with good old Arturo, a draconian embargo has been placed on the graph. So I was unable to reproduce it on the hooting yard website. So instead, I'll do my best to summarize the points he makes using plain words, rather than exciting graphic hullabaloo first, first, botsman is given the duck honorific mine here, in spite of the fact that all the available evidence suggests he was Swiss. Though there have been arguments of deathly tedium, questioning his nationality nobody has ever claimed botsman was a Neverland, or even a Belgian as for the so called Africana cradle in the nursery conjecture, that nonsense was comprehensively demolished Long, long ago, by yours truly on primetime television, no less, thanks to the good offices of Russell hearty. Secondly, botsman was famously teetotal and never allowed a drop of spirit as well. gotta pass his lips. The idea he would be found lying ruined by drink at a marina is laughable. It is true. He was fond of the sea, which he memorably described as that soaking wet immensity stretching to the horizon and beyond. And he often sculpt about ports and harbors and key sides and marinas doing his blots many doings. But those doings were always done sober, have no doubt about that, too, which one might add, that his love of coastal pearl use did not extend to the sea itself, for he was a boat scared man all his life that he would ever have gone yachting is inconceivable. In a different section of his fantastic graph, Arturo demonstrates that at the time, the children's duty was recorded, the taser had not yet been invented. In those days, if one wanted to fail a malefactor, one use the club or a bludgeon the taser itself in its initial form, like from 1974, the year of POTUS Richard Nixon's disgrace and resignation. In any case, as the upper right segment of the graph demonstrates with admirable clarity, one needs neither taser nor club nor bludgeon to subdue assault in a coma, whose collapses due to his having glugs an uncountable amount of in some way, and the rhyme makes no sense whatsoever. Hot brain Gallic postmodernist jack post mode has attempted to undo as he puts it, Arturo's tremendous diagram, but nobody takes him seriously anymore Thank heaven, which all goes to show that the life can be sucked out of even the dirtiest children's chant when the leeches of academe are properly applied.

During the last splatters of the Harold Wilson years, I had occasion to read a slim book entitled Zen Buddhism, which consisted simply of a series of what I think are called cones or colons, not sure how it's pronounced. anecdotes or parables designed to assist one in striving towards Zen enlightenment. I do not recall any particular cone in detail, but they all seemed very similar. And tucked away in my memory. There's a sort of generic cone, which goes something like this.

One day, beanbag was fishing in a stream and he caught a pike. He decided to take it to his master as a gift. Here, Master, I have brought you a pike. He said. beanbags, Master took the pike and then he picked up a stick and bashed his pupil about the head with it. Ouch. wailed been bag. Why are you hitting me when I have brought you a pike. The master pushed beanbag down a slope and resumed his meditation. beanbag rubbed his head and understood he was one step further towards enlightenment. I was young and impressionable. But even then I could see that this was complete twaddle. Compared to zen, Roman Catholicism seemed sensible and coherent. I decided to have no track with Eastern mysticism in future. Years later, however, I was glad I had read the book. I was commissioned to write a potted biography of the Whoo hoo hoo woman, and struggled to find an angle from which to approach the subject. Then I realized that the witless cones provided an ideal model. I was able to scribble dozens of short yarns about the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman, based on my faltering recollection of Zen cones. The only changes I had to make what's a substitute for Zen masters bashing and shoving with the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman's technique of making haphazard gesticulations at a robin or at a flock of sparrows, or in extremists when faced with a particularly recalcitrant acolyte. Wandering woozily off to a nearby kiosk to buy herself a toffee apple. And that brings us smartly to the end of our alphabet.

So anyway, while I was concentrating on subject matter from A to Zed number of other things came to my attention that I didn't have didn't really think I could insert into it on the on the hooting yard, website or indeed on the show. So making up for lost time. We can address some of those things. Now I wrote a book while I was doing the alphabet, called strange cults and secret societies of modern London, by Elliot O'Donnell, modern in this case being 1934, which is when the book was published. His book is to be believed, Mr. O'Donnell could hardly walk into a pub or a hotel lobby, or go for a walk in a park without bumping into someone who had an astonishing tale to tell of weird and hitherto unsuspected goings on in the city and its suburbs. Some of those I'm going to bring to your attention now. I after reading the book, which I think you'll agree with me from the bits I read of it is absolutely fascinating. I discovered that Elliot O'Donnell wrote innumerable innumerable books about, basically about cults, secret societies, ghosts, hauntings, werewolves and so on, and was apparently very respected in the in the field. But more recently, since his death, I think in the late 50s, or the mid 50s. Apparently, some of his accounts have been called into question, which I find a great pity because I think we should accept all of them as absolute truth. Here's one. This is the quote, as I say, from strange cults, and secret societies of modern London, by Elliot O'Donnell. One evening, an acquaintance of mine, who is an Irish writer of some repute, having drunk rather more than was good for him. By no means unusual occurrence. In attempting to stagger home from his club, by some means, he could never quite explain, got into a strange house instead of his own, and found himself in a semi dark room full of queer looking people, male and female, clad in leopard skins, being given a skin by a dark, foreign looking girl, he tried to put it on, and in spite of it of his addled senses, he's so far succeeded that no one appeared to notice it was upside down. Probably no one paid any heed to him. everyone's attention being centered on a woman who was standing in the middle of the room, haranguing them. My friend could not see her very distinctly owing to the lights being turned down, but he judged her to be colored. She looked so dark, and not a British subject, but she spoke with a decided foreign accent. The cool night air, blowing into the room, through an open window, near at hand, gradually sobered him, and his brain became quite clear. He realized then, that the people around him belonged to some strange exotic cult. And finally, the amazing fact that they were leopard and Panther people dawned on him.

The unfortunate thing about that person ticular quotation is that Elliot O'Donnell is usually very careful to tell us where abouts in London or there abouts his his anecdotes take place to add greater verisimilitude no doubt. Also, it's a shame he doesn't identify the Irish writer of some repute and one of the readers of the hooting yard website in the comments on that piece has been researching trying to work out who it was. So if you go to the website at hooting yard.org and look it up, you'll be able to follow the research. Here's another quotation anyway, from the same book, this one with a distinct in fact very clear geographical location. Just out of bravado, my friend had slept several nights under a tree known to followers of the tree cult as dangerous near certain old crossroads in the south Mimms district. Now, like murder, some vices will out. And when I saw my friend after he had been sleeping under that tree, I was startled at the great change in his appearance. In his face, I could detect signs of vice. I had never associated with him before. He confessed his guilt to me and attributed it as I have already hinted to the crossroads and tree influence. As he lay under the tree in question, watching it's gently swaying branches over his head, and its smooth, gleaming trunk. He felt a current advice emanating from it and passing into him. He felt it was trying to communicate telepathically with him, trying to fill his mind with its own foul and beastly ideas. And when at last he fell asleep, his dreams so strengthened his vicious thoughts that he could never shake them off. Day and night. They obsessed him and eventually he indulged in the vise from the urge to which there seemed to be no escape as a last resort, in his efforts to turn over a new leaf, he went abroad, and I have never heard of him since. I've got a couple of questions there. To what foul and beastly vice did Mr. O'Donnell's friends come? And it's the sinister tree is south Mimms still standing almost 80 years later. It could be also what type of tree was it? Is it a large a you? Perhaps we will never know. That's the end of this week's hooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it and found it educational. I will be back next week after my dipping my toe into the freeze Art Fair over the weekend. Bye bye
