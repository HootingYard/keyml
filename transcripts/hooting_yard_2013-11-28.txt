Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air. And I'd like to thank john for allowing me to read my horoscope on on his show dress now. I didn't meet a boy called Leo in 1973, unfortunately, but they go Twas brillig and I babble Joffe until my listeners cried enough, and stopped my god with a plug of dough. And then it was that I knew Whoa. Whoa, such as I'd never known. Not even when I was skin and bone in starveling days of pimply youth, before I grew so fat, forsooth fat and loud and babbling guff. Oh, oyster, oyster swagger and path puffed up like one of those eerie toads that leapt at you from beside the roads. Well, at least they leap at what I wrote of them in my memoir, the texture which is what I braid, hoping to make my listeners afraid. Instead, I plugged My God with dough, and brought me down so very low, that now My life is full of Whoa. And it is time for me to go. Go where? To the seaside, I suppose to my seaside Shall I Oh, prose to thump my typewriter, the legend keys and right of Hornets, wasps and bees.

That was a bit of verse and this is a bit of prose. So fatuous snugs be preening in his Perry Wigan epaulettes factory was to his fat friend the king standing on the pier beckoning goals.

and call the sneakz B to execute a hurried pencil sketch, which can later be worked up into a huge oil painting for the Kings gallery. But no goals swooped today, for it's one of those Birdland days in the kingdom. The sky is empty of birds, as happens on the bird list days, which, alas the Kings prognosticators can never predict with any accuracy. Where the birds go on these days, has not yet been ascertained. Though several philosophers are hard at work in the king's tower, trying to account for the circumstance. The philosophers previous task was to explain the workings of railway timetables, a job they performed so well that the king presented every man track of them with Perry wigs and epaulets, and special coins to keep in their pockets. They were toy coins, not legal tender, but they christened brightly and pleased the philosophers who were easily pleased by kingly gifts. sneakz B was too fatuous to be a philosopher or prognosticator and to be frank he was something of a butterfingers with his sketching pencil. But so vacuous was the fact king that he thought snugs be cack handed scribbles was surpassing in loveliness. When the king called him, snakes be scampered forwards along the pier, but he tripped on top of them plunged into the sea. Mermaids snatched away his pencil and his sketchpad, his Perry wig and his epaulettes and pawpaw snakes be flailing in the water under a bird The sky was dragged below the surface by the mermaids pet scavenger fish. They fixed him with limpets to a sea bed rock there to perish. The king who had not noticed snakes, bees fall groups Tired of calling grew tired of holding out his upturned Millett scattered palm at the end of the pier on a bird last day, he tossed the millet into the sea and turned on his heel and minced back to the promenade where his horse waited. With the immense patience of a horse. The King mounted his steed and gallops along the coast to an ice cream kiosk. Would tomorrow be birthless, too?

Think of almost exciting Sherlock Holmes stories we could have read had Watson got his finger out and written them down. And last week, you may recall if you were listening carefully, I read an article called inside a spaceship from the magazine awareness from summer 1968, which was the Journal of an organization called contact UK. Contact appears to have been some sort of UFO space people. Organization, although given that I'm contact and also given the name of of the piece that I promised last week, I would read to you this week. Young extraterrestrials wants to make contact. It does make you wonder if it's some kind of dating magazine. Anyway, last week, I read you the case of a young Irish man who had an encounter with a UFO when stumbling home drunk from a jazz club in Belfast in 1967. And this week, I'm going to read to you the following article from contact about Mrs. See. This, we believe is one of the first modern contact stories ever to be published. It was related by the witness, a housewife living near Coventry, who we will call Mrs. C. Her first contact with spacemen took place in 1940s 1940. Sorry, and her last encounter occurred around 1952 like the Belfast contactee Mrs. C is a healthy, well balanced person whose moral qualities are quite outstanding. We consider her to be a truthful and honest person who does not stand to gain by relating her experiences. I am now 45 years old, a housewife with children. It was around 1940 while walking down a country lane one afternoon in Meriden near Coventry, that I came across by sheer accident, a dome shaped craft and it's crew. They were tall men standing around the craft, apparently adjusting something around the perimeter. They were all wearing one piece garments and had unusually high foreheads with something different about the eyes. The craft appeared to be quite solid, giving off a gray blue light. I recalled walking past the craft, and on retracing my steps I was surprised to find it had disappeared. A few months later, whilst at work, I had another experience. I had occasion to go into the department where lifting work was done. There I noticed a tall youngish man engaged in this work. The first thing that struck me was the way in which he was doing this. He seemed that complete ease and under no strain compared with the others. His overalls were also unusually clean. He saw me and came up I then recognized him to be one of the crew that I had seen by the craft at Meriden. He said that my war, remember this is 1940 was upsetting his world. I laughed and reminded him that it was his two. He was quick to answer that he did not come from this world and said, Take me to your king and queen. I replied that it would be impossible for him to make contact with them, especially during the war. He then asked if I could go with him to the country homes of head scientists and other leaders, in order that they could talk over their differences with each other. I replied that it was no use me going with him. As I was insignificant. He had no accent, and I don't recollect seeing him at the factory again. During the whole of the three years I worked there. If ever I felt depressed or miserable, I used to suddenly remember this unusual person and yearn for a meeting with him. This was really only an escape into dreamland for me.

Frank Key  16:14
Then, one day in 1951, I arrived home to find that I had a visitor. He explained that he was a messenger, and had signed on for the job. He said that unless I really wanted to meet the person that I had seen at the factory, I was to refrain from intruding on his thoughts. I was completely bewildered and recall thinking that he must be mad, as it was impossible, I could have done this. I was taken several times to the craft, which was usually situated on some lonely grassland spot, I got the impression that three people had got something for erasing your memory from the time of Sorry, I get the impression that these people had got something for erasing your memory. From the time of contact until the war on the craft. I was sure that it was connected with the unusual watch that they wore on their wrists. The interior of the craft was about the size of four double bedrooms. It was well lit, although I could not see where the light emanated from. One side of the wall was filled by some sort of scanner, another was filled with row upon row of meters. In the center was a table made of what appeared to be fiberglass. This slid into the floor. Most of the crew looked similar to us, averaging six to seven feet in height, high foreheads with greased black hair to neckline and smaller noses. They came and went from the craft. Others who stayed in permanently were very different. They had a bluish complexion, and slightly different facial bone structure. They had larger mouths, and their large eyes had side vision as well as frontal. They all wore either brown or blue one piece garments. I thought the most intriguing thing about them with the way in which they were able to transfer their thoughts to each other. This seemed to be a natural gift to them. It required deep concentration on their person, on the person you were thinking to, with the exclusion of all other thoughts. They tried to teach me how to do this, but I never really mastered it. I was told that I didn't try hard enough and that anyone could do it. When I didn't wander off and just bed, I found that I was able to read their thoughts and answer them. By asked me many questions, such as how blood transfusions were administered, and about household gadgets. They wanted to know about everything I had ever done or witnessed on what I believed to be right or wrong. Often I didn't understand what I said and asked me to visualize such things. One time I got rather tired of all Excuse me. One time, I got rather tired will look questions and cursed my interrogator. I didn't mean any harm, but they insisted I retracted it because we do not understand the power of thought. If we wish someone ill it can often bounce back on ourselves. They said it wouldn't harm them, but may have an adverse effect on my children and me. The space people but krisztian in attitude They are not ceremonious where they come from. They said that we were immature and still had to grow up. They also mentioned that before people could live together in equality, there would be trouble among the races, it would be so bad that people of all races would be too ashamed afterwards, to even mention it. Whatever my space friends may think of us, they will not harmless. They were very kind and patient, and I always felt that complete ease with them. The older members of the crew told me that it wouldn't help to tell a story of my encounters, as it would be of no benefit to me personally, I was told that in order to have success, making open contact, a great number of people had to believe that it is true and can be done. We in contact UK, I've set out to do this as one of our aims. One of the crew claimed to be a member of the wildlife Preservation Society. So I was half jokingly told, by wildlife, they meant our human race, they very much wanted to help mankind.

Frank Key  21:16
Some of the crew had signed on for the mission without really knowing what it entailed. However, the driver or leader of the craft always knew the purpose. He was responsible for the craft and never left it unless there was a replacement. If I took away my initial fear of them, and the unknown and unfamiliar ways of their life, I was shown a book it was fairly thick with dark embossed with a dark embossed cover. Inside was a strange writing I had never seen before. It reminded me of something not unlike shorthand. I was also shown a map of the solar system. And although I was not really interested in interested in it at the time, I met I remember being told to look to the east to find these people. Another interesting feature in the craft was a black screen on which white lettering would appear and seemingly self raised. They wanted an exchange of ideas with us and wanted also to obtain some of our kitchen gadgets for trading. They also wanted to help us grow up that as one of them pointed out, it involves a great deal more than you think. It will come onboard the spacecraft where people from different planets, the older ones didn't particularly want to be involved with our planet. But the younger ones did express the wish to make contact. They asked me whom they should contact. I was bewildered. And so were they but they said that they would keep trying. There will be a lot of misunderstandings and errors, but we will understand in the end. Like the Belfast contact. This amazing and most revealing story is but a synopsis of the full report. Peter Coleman is producing the full report of the encounters to be published shortly. details to be announced in our next issue of awareness.

Frank Key  24:12
So bearing all that in mind if you do meet a space person, have a kitchen gadget with you and be prepared to discuss it and perhaps trade with it. Not sure what kitchen gadget you might want to use. Maybe even a simple whisk would be enough who knows. In golf, he shook panting there was a crocus in his buttonhole. It was wilted now. The morning was a damp one, and he had no hat for it. snagged on a thornbush a mile back and in his Hurry, he could not stop to retrieve it. Like King James the first his tongue was overlarge for the mouth that contained it. And he was forever slobbering over the head, the flak from fighter jet drowned out birdsong. As it was, he could never tell the call of one bird from another. His ears simply did not have the ability to distinguish. Often as now, he thought of the custody of his childhood suffers thoughts that made him slobber or were more shaking in the goals, hapless and ignorant. He came of good family ruined by speculation. grumble is all moaning at their misfortune. But he did not moan. He had a different bent. I shall follow my own star. He had said almost his first words rendered barely intelligible by that too big tongue. Follow it he did, even when it was invisible in the morning mist. Shaking in the goals, he scanned the sky for portent but could see all the blur of milky half light. He struck a match and set fire to a flare. up it went fizzing orange Lee. They came for him before noon, the Mr. dispersed and the fighter jets had long past birdsong could be heard again. They interrogated him about his hat. There was no question but they he must retrace his steps as far as the thornbush, hatless his prediction would never be heard. He stumbled back the way he had come before dawn. Everything looked so different in the blaze of noon, so different that certainly was lost, so lost, and instead of the thornbush he came upon a bloom and splendid Lake, upon which thousands of swans were arrayed, all gazing directly at him. He slumped to the ground and took from his pocket or Brazil that would he pop it into his mouth, or plop it into the river, like what would you have done in his place? Your answer should be roughly 200 words in length on one side of a sheet of paper. Let's send it to me at Holton yard. That's the end of this week's show. Bye bye.
