Wouldn't it be amusing if we got Johnny seven by gray bags to the top of the hit parade? So come on, listeners rush out and buy a copy. And in your millions, he probably only needs a few thousand nowadays to get to number one. And then we could you know, it could be on pick up a week on Radio One or whatever it's called. Anyway, I think that would be highly amusing. And so I urge all of you to purchase a copy I'm not sure how you purchase a copy but I'm sure a copy of purchasable just send money. send money. Yes, anyway. Yes, that was that was the end of tronic seven show with Johnny seven by gray bags. I almost feel like playing it myself. This, by the way is the following show hooting the art on the air. My name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for almost but not quite half an hour. And one of the incidental pleasures of reading the long forgotten Memoirs of obscure figures from our island history is to stumble upon fleeting mentions of that gruesome ogre of children's nightmares, the grumpy man. All of us I think, can recall the shiver that ran down our spine. When we sat up my mom calls me and she read to us Tales of the fearsome grumpy man lurking in his cave and occasionally emerging into the light, to grunt and grunt and lay waste the earth and grunt some more. Now we're grown we can look back with fondness on this both some fantastical creature safe in the knowledge that he never really existed. What did he the other day, I was reading the long forgotten Memoirs of an obscure figure in our Ireland history. The expatriate Hollander, Joost van dongle baraque. It's an unfathomably doull book, or I should say booked for van dongle Brack managed to eke seven fat closely printed volumes from what was by any measure, a fairly uneventful life. I love this stuff, and could read it until the cows come home. I was about halfway through volume three, when, to my delight and consternation I came upon this passage. luncheon that day, I ate a goodly amount of my lady Kemp pudding, but it had not been sufficiently boiled, or perhaps it had been boiled for too long. For shortly after digesting my third bowlful I suffered the most terrible mortification of the bowels, and had to be carried from my place, by the servants, and deposited on an ottoman in the smoking room, where I moaned weekly, and cursed heaven. Thereafter to make Recompense. When I was able to move, I repaired to my private chapel, and offered origins to the almighty that he might spare me from the horrors inflicted by skittish cooks. I then determined to berate said cook, and had her summon from the pantry, only to bought only to be told she was not to be found there. I strongly suspected her of being involved in unseemly canoodling with Mr. snippet, the gardener and so I pulled on my out of doors boots, and went striding through the ground past the film but hedges on towards the Haha, were sniffing had his heart. While I was walking last, waving my stick, I caught a fleeting glimpse of the grumpy man darting between the elms. When I reached the heart, I banged my fist on the door, hoping to disturb the gardener and the cook. But there was no response. And when I opened the door to peer inside, I found the hut was empty. My mood was now tempestuous. So on my way back to the house. I berated one of the estate peasants, who was pushing a wheelbarrow full of dead toads from one pond to another, shouting my head off, did me the world of good.

Frank Key  05:15
Back in the house I settled in the library and spent a profitable our reading their collection of sermons by Parson freak pit outside the sky with luring, and there were hints of English drizzle. I closed the book and thought longingly of the canals of my homeland. These thoughts were interrupted by a servant who came to inform me that the cook and Mr. Snip edge had been seen boarding the male coach heading for the coast. I cursed heaven once again, kick the servant all the way along the corridor, and feeling a renewed mortification of the bowels. shut myself in the thunder box until it was time for supper. for supper that day, I took goodly amount of my lady can put in.

Frank Key  06:23

And particularly if you have had a fleeting glimpse of the grumpy man. Last week, I tried to play something and I'm going to have another go playing it now. And we'll see if it works. It might work.

that was almost as exciting as Johnny seven by gray bags. That was my brother, who, who lives in San Francisco has done for decades. And he's recently taken to making little films of himself singing Japanese songs. You can actually watch him singing that voting yard website at hooting yard.org always well worth a visit. And when I say he's taken the film's chloral there's one so far there's one film of my brother singing a song, but I thought I should play it to you. I have no idea what that was about probably something to do Yoko Ono. Anyway, In other news, I should mention that next week, there's a rare opportunity to see me babbling prose in front of a live audience and you could be in that audience.

For this recipe I read, you will require a bag of frozen crinkle cut oven kit, six cans of sculpture, a turnip, a parsnip, a pallet of Carlsbad plums and the head of a pre slaughtered pig. So I went to the shops and bought a bag of frozen crinkle cut oven trips, six cans of sculpture, a turnip, a parsnip, and a Punnett of Carlsbad plums. obtaining the head of a pre slaughtered pig proved more difficult. Not one among the parade of shops I frequented had any such thing in stock. The butchers, which was my best hope had its shutters down and a scribbled sign posted on the shutters announcing closure due to rampant infectious disease, though it did not specify whether this referred to the butcher himself or to his supply of meat. Sitting on a municipal bench eating one of the Carlsbad plums I wonder if I might make a vegetarian version of the dish using a pig's head fashion from marzipan. But my skills as a sculptor or molder have atrophied since the heady days of my youth at the Institute for sculpting and molding. And I was not convinced my effort with marzipan would yield anything that looked remotely akin to the head of a pig. By the time I had eaten the second Carlsbad plant, it was clear to me that I would have to go in search of a pre slaughtered pig and remove its head. It is surprisingly difficult in this day and age to find a dead pig in a small town. I wandered into the countryside, keeping my eyes peeled, peering into bogs and ditches. This proving fruitless, I made my way to the top of a bluff from where I could see for miles around. The climb was arduous, and when I reached the summit, I was thirsty, so I opened one of the cans of sculpture, and downed it in a single glog. gazing out across the countryside, I shouted, dead pig dead pig, Come out, come out wherever you are. I hoped by this means to coax into view a peasant pushing a wheelbarrow in which rested a pre slaughtered pig. Such a sight is not uncommon in the countryside, or so I'm given to understand from my reading of various bucolic texts, in the pauses between my repeated shoutings I felt a wondering if an urban person could be a Bane Was there an equivalent countryside quality in which a rustic person could be Rusty's? I had no opportunity to find out for after an hour or so atop the Bluff, not a single peasant had appeared. The day was hot, and I noticed that my bag of frozen crinkle cut oven chips was almost entirely thawed. I was also conscious that I had depleted my stocks of both Carlsbad plums and squelched Joe. Unless I returned home in haste, I would end up consuming all the non pig's head ingredients for the recipe, and my day would be wasted. skittered down from the bluff like a gambling lamb and headed back through the fields of Mark towards town. All the while I was racking my brains trying to think of an acceptable substitute for the pre slaughtered pig's head. What did I have in my cupboard? Pink wafer biscuit, peas, a bowl of fayrouz, a jar of pickles, several contaminated cocktail sausages, blah, blah. Somehow, none of these seem quite right, nor even remotely suitable. If I was to vary the recipe, then the least I could do was to use something's head. By now I was nearing town, so I looked around me with fresh eyes. All I had to do was spot a living creature sees it, slaughter it, remove its head and pop the head into my puppy bag, along with the bag of now I'm frozen crinkle cut oven chips, the turnip, the parsnip and what was left of the cans of squirrelled Joe and the cold, bad plums, both further depleted on account of peckish nurse and thirst during my long countryside trunk.

There were plenty of creepy crawlies to be seen, but their tiny tiny heads were hardly fit for purpose. Just as I was losing hope, I came upon a pond at the edge of which a toad was flopping about with a cry of inhuman savagery. I fell upon it seized it and strangled it. Then I bit off the head, spat it out, wrapped it in a sheet of greaseproof paper I happen to have in my pity bag and carried it home. I would not be able to follow the recipe with 100% accuracy, but I felt confident that I could knock together a two thumb supper. Alas, I did not consider that the toad I pre slaughtered might be one of those toads that is highly toxic. But so it was. As I write these words, I am shaking violently, sweating, vomiting, and my own head has swelled to twice its usual size. I fear that what I tucked into an hour ago, after an exciting time at the cutting board, will prove to be my last supper.

Those of you who regularly read the hooting yard website well know that back in December of last year, I ran an advent calendar daily post of photographs from the archives of the kiboko gift. Those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, the kiboko gift was a short lived organization. Sort of offshoot of the Boy Scouts, devoted to camping and Woodcraft. And in the night, I think it lasted from 1920 to 1929. And they never had more than a few hundred members. And they were almost entirely based in the southeast of England. And the founder john Hargrave was he then became more interested in wacky economic theories. And most of the kiboko lifters left and he seemed puzzled by this and there's a great recording of him being interviewed and saying, I really don't understand I wanted to talk about economics, but they just wanted to go camping. So they left and perhaps the reason that they wanted to go camping was like because that's what the Kimbo gift was all about. Anyway, they had fantastically colorful tents, like carried totems and very interesting organization, but they had a kind of somewhat mystical, mystical air about them. And in 1925 john Hargrave wrote an article called a short exposition of the philosophical basis of the kiboko gift. And includes this essay, it includes a passage where Hargrave insists on I quote, the unity of the unique unit of the universe. So I'd like to read that to you now. It's a fantastic quotation. You can find it in a splendid book called The Kindred of the kiboko gift by Annabella Pollan, which I do recommend you read. It's recently been acclaimed as the most beautiful book in Switzerland. I don't know, I didn't know they had an award for the most beautiful book in Switzerland, but they do. It's a great book. And I do recommend it and you can find links to where you can buy it on the hooting yard website, but anyway, let's, let's hear john Hargrave talking about the unity of the unique units of the universe. teapot chairs, mud, electric light bulbs, fingernails, hammers, steam engines, mountains, hats, shoes, needles, tram tickets, lilies, telephones, tents, dynamos, walking sticks, cow down, churches, iron foundries, neckties, cat, human beings, steel plates, bricks and mortar, glass, ceiling wax, trees, thoughts, tables, music, flowers and flower pots, clouds, gutter gratings books, food, buttons, machine guns, beads, rain, clocks, boots, Ferro concrete, eggs, sunlight, coal, stars, solar systems, slugs, pictures, maggots, wheel bolt, smells, darkness and light, color studs, speech, seeds, birds, boot laces, insect skeletons, peppercorns, babies, space, time, matter, all religions, all spirits, all materials, all all are accurately for one the great power.

I think we've just got time for one more piece. I'll run through it quite quickly in the United States during the 1950s. People often found communists hiding under their bed that this was a common phenomenon is clear from the historical record. There are numerous contemporary accounts of which the following is a typical example. It comes from a letter written to his local newspaper by a solid citizen in one of the midwestern states. One day last week, just after turning in for the night and settling down to sleep, I became aware of a rustling noise under my bed. I was far too tired to get up. So taking my torch from the bedside table, I leaned right over and with my head upside down, Shawn the torch under the bed. I was startled to see lying on the floor, an urbane and stylishly dressed man who had about him something of the air of an important State Department diplomat. He was faffing about with bits of microfilm. Who the hell are you and what are you doing under my bed? I cried. Oh, good evening, he replied in the cultured voice of an East Coast Mandarin. I'm so sorry to disturb you. Allow me to introduce myself. hiss. Alger Hiss. This is a fine piece of carpet By the way, very comfortable. While he was saying this, he was hardly stuffing the bits of microfilm into the pockets of his Expensive Jacket to conceal them. I'm pleased you like my carpet, I said, but you haven't explained what you're doing under my bed. Alger Hiss ignored my question and took from an inside pocket of his Expensive Jacket a pamphlet which he thrust at me Wonder if I might interest you in this pamphlet? He said, it gives a Marxist Leninist perspective on the current crisis and is well worth reading. Should you wish to remove the imperialist blinkers from your eyes. I'm not one for bookish learning. I said, Well, it's a pamphlet rather than a book. Perhaps you could leave it on your bedside table and pick it up later. Perhaps I said, but at that point, Alger Hiss unleashed upon the strange bright eyed gaze of fiendish communist hypnotic power, and I promptly fell into a deep, deep and troubled sleep. When I woke up, he was gone, and there was no sign he had ever been there, save for the pamphlet on the bedside table, which I handed over to my local FBI agent for analysis. Although we have many similar accounts, what has been lacking to date is counter testimony from communists themselves, explaining what they hope to retrieve by hiding under the bed. Or were more welcome there is a new book by the pseudonymous agent x. It's entitled why I spent much of the 1950s hiding under the beds of solid citizens, and it's a rollicking good read, or at least it would be where it not padded out with lengthy passages of indigestible Marxist dialectic and incoherent socio socio economic blathering. I've extracted the key passage so you don't need to read the book itself. I received instructions from Uri, my Moscow handler that I was to be a sleeper. Unfortunately, the microfilm bearing his message was damaged by pigeons. And it was not entirely clear to me how I was to proceed. Sleeping seemed to be the gist of it, however, and my faith in the party was unshakable. So I did not question how useful this would be in fomenting the great proletarian revolution and bringing the hated capitalist United States to its knees. Instead, I found a darkened room with a bed in it and lay me down to sleep. But something was not right. And I soon realized what it was. The boardwalk comforts of mattresses and pillows and blankets were a terrible distraction, classic techniques of the degenerate system to allow me into false consciousness. Or in this case, false unconsciousness. I extrude them and lay down instead in the dark on the floor under the bed. Soon enough, word got out among my fellow spies, and we were all at it. Happy Days.

Frank Key  27:58
Some of these sleepers were so fanatical and so devoted to the cause, that a quarter of a century after the fall of the Soviet Empire, there are still thought to be several communists hiding under beds in the American Midwest, solid citizens, Be on your guard. And that's the end of hosting for this week. I'll be back next week. But meanwhile, come along, if you're in London come along to the Brewers, the Brewers arms, and brewers bar anywhere, whatever I said earlier on the shacklewell line in Dalston at eight o'clock next Wednesday, and I'll be revealing all sorts of stuff. Live. So see you there. Bye bye.
