Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Those of you who have listened to the three hour recording of me and germander speedwell reading khubilai agnosia by Christopher smart. And if you haven't listened to that, I suggest you do so forthwith. I'm sure you can find a link to it somewhere on the web. Just dribble out agonized Frank ke germander speedwell into Google, and you'll probably find it and then sit back for three hours. Anyway, those of you who've already listened to it will or read the poem will probably remember the lions. Lead has blessed with the politest lively subtlety is acceptable for the Lord led bars blessed with the jackal. But the Lord is the lions provider. I wonder whatever became of Hausen, bows, the stout companions of my childhood. On the long summer afternoons, we three played together in the shadow of the old viaduct out by Pang Hill. We've played football and hockey, and we pole vaulting over decrees, and we set fire to buttercups, and we've pretended to be Prussians or Russians or monsters from the far Carpathians, and always has had his politest puppet of woolen wire, and bows, his cardboard jackal. And in the glomming, at the end of those endless days, hasn't bows would crop back to Pang Hill orphanage and sneak in through the hidden wicked gate. And I would try and time along the canal towpath rife with flocks and lupins to the enormous mansion, where mom and pop lay on separate Ottomans in separate chambers in separate wings. Both of them neurasthenic, and medicated and moaning. I ate my dinner with crouch, the impossibly tall and gangling servant in the baronial Hall tenebrous and kill where bats swooped in the rafters, and the rafters rotted, and sometimes shards of rafter dropped into my soup. And I thought of husband buzz, shivering in their attic room in the orphanage, going hungry to their iron cots. Sometimes in the night, I would slip out of bed and paddle along the corridor water miles wireless room to transmit coded messages, buzzes and clicks and bleeps to my pals. Either has or both I forget, which had smuggled a portable metal Tapping Machine into the orphanage and kept it hidden under the sand bag that served as his pillow. It was a hazardous business, for there was always the risk that he might be caught by the beetle. If that happened, how's your boss would be made to put a source but on his head on spend a week on the orphanage roof among the crows and ravens without shelter slaking his thirst with rainwater from the gutters. It was hazardous for me to the wireless room was thick with dust and cobwebs, spiders and beetles and gnats. Ma had abandoned it long ago before I was born. Once it had been her sanctum when she was young and lively and the recipient of mountaineering trophies, crowd still polished the trophies devotedly day after day with his special rags. The messages we exchanged in the night were couched in a private language hasn't been I had devised. I still have some of the transcripts, musty and dog eared the ink fading in a filing cabinet in what was once past smoking room. I do not know why I keep them for I long ago forgot the language and can ring no sense from them. Perhaps it is they are the sole remaining tangible reminders of my childhood from And the orphanage, the railings of which I often stood and wept burned down last year. The Beatles grandson was arrested. But I do not know the outcome of the case. The local police officers do not speak to me anymore.

As a child, I was barely aware that the police existed certainly on those long afternoons by the old viaduct hasn bars and I never once saw a police officer. The only person we ever saw in uniform was the Tommy man with his dog on his patrols, and we would always hide from him. We used to make up stories in which he and his dog were involved in alarming has cam episodes. Once I think hazal bows devised a plan to kidnap the dog and take it back to Pang Hill orphanage to attack the beetle, until I pointed out that it was an old and lame and almost blind dog and could not attack one of the gnats in the wireless room. Then one day, we saw the tally man alone and dogless, and we assumed the dog had died. We decided to make an excursion to the pet cemetery to leave a bunch of loopings on his grave. The pet cemetery was out beyond the orchard and the railway tracks and the decor airfield. But none of us was clear precisely where it was. And we got lost. The sun was sinking in the West. When we came to an army camp. I was worried about crouch who would be cooking our soup and herrings. And we'll be wondering, Well, I'd got to Hausen bars were fearful of the beetle, who would no doubt be pulling a couple of source funds from their hooks and clearing the staircase up to the roof. Though it was summer, there was a chill in the air at dusk, and we shivered as we sank exhausted to the ground at the perimeter fence. We were far from home, far from the mansion, the orphanage, and we had no idea what to do. When the sky grew darker search lights flashed on and we were caught in them, bright beam of one century spotted us and took us into the camp. He put us in a tent and told us to wait. We were I think, so awestruck by his uniform, so much more resplendent, and that of the tally man that we could hardly think we made no attempt to escape. About half an hour passed before a captain entered. his uniform was even more impressive, all crimson and gold with epaulets and medals, and he carried a sword. He wrapped a few questions at us, which we answered truthfully, in shaky little squeak for we were tired of hungry and terrified. Then he left Hausen bars and I rummaged in our pockets for playthings and improvised a game with a button a rubber band and a boiled sweet wrapper that kept us occupied until we heard the splattering of an engine, followed by the pop of a hooter. It was crouch, he had been summoned to collect us. At least, that is what we thought. When he came into the tent, accompanied by the captain, we burst into tears of relief for housing buzz, alas, the relief was short lived, the captain announced that crouch had come to take me home. As for your orphans, he said, war was declared earlier today. And we know every recruit we can lay our hands on. You will be shipped overseas at the break of dawn to fight the good fight. I clutched crouches hand, and he led me away to waters jalopy. As we went out through the 10th flap. I looked back at housing bars, my childhood friends, I never saw them again.

So I hope where the county or city or place where you come from was mentioned in that list, and it made some kind of sense to you. And moving on within minutes of beginning my research into the poultry yards of arch Kooks. I struck gold. I suppose I should not have been surprised to learn that it was a topic to which Dobson had turned his attention in his pamphlet, the poultry yards of the Grand arch Kooks out of print. Like a day is Hadrian Neverland would put it I then struck base metal for it turns out that this is one of the rarest of the rare of Dobson pamphlet and I couldn't not get my hands on a copy. try as I might. Not that I tried very hard, having other things on my mind, such as pencils performance in the World Cup, guff, pomposity and potato crisps, of which more later If it pleases Your Lordship. Now the obtain ability of a pamphlet would do a knockout blow to a Wheezy milk syrup researcher, but I am made of sterner stuff. I gulped down a beaker of sculpture, and at dead of night, I stole out to the weird woods of Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo, and sought out the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. I found her crouching in a patch of nettles moving her withered arms in some in comprehensible but no doubt eldritch fashion and muttering gibberish good old Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman I thought she never let you down. Not least if you remember to bring her a gift. As I did. I greeted her and handed over a rather smug back number of the Reader's Digest. I had no idea to what weird and spooky you should put it, but it's better not to ask. She gave the magazine a couple of gummy bites to make sure it was genuine. And then asked me in her weird Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo voice what I wanted. I cleared my throat Are you familiar with the out of print pamphlet in Dobson? I asked. When I spoke aloud the great man's name an owl hooted and a wolf how the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman's head moved slightly in what might have been a nod. It was either that or magical spasm. I pressed on. There is an unobtainable pamphlet by Dobson which I feel impelled to read a woman of Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo. I continued. And I was wondering if through your tremendously strange powers, you might be able to commune with transients shimmer rings of Ecto plasmic do dark and somehow have transmitted to you. The full text of this pamphlet, entitled the poultry yards of the granddad cooks, and declaim it to me here in the weird woods in moonlight, while I scribbled down what you say in my notepad with my propelling pencil, I've patted my pocket to indicate that I had come prepared with these essential items. The Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman did some business with a toad on a news and a hacksaw and some parsley and the bleached and boiled skull of a Starling and a handful of breadcrumbs. And there was a mighty flash of eerie incandescence across the sky, and a boom as of thunder, and then she began to rise in hideous jarring contortions. As the night hair grew chill as the grave. Then she began to babble. And I started scribbling. When we were done, I patted the weird woman on her weird head, promised her further back copies of the Reader's Digest, or her other favorite periodical cop talk. And I headed for home, crashing the precious recovered text. I had a long day's work ahead of me, transcribing the scribble in my notepad using my eye Woo, a fantastic new device from Apple, specifically designed for the transcription of unearthly hallucinate re babblings into tough, sensible prose.

I chuckled to myself, wondering what Dobson would have made about 21st century technology. Somehow, I couldn't imagine the great man twittering or Facebooking or posting videos on YouTube. Though there is of course, that tantalizing paragraph in his pamphlet, tantalizing paragraphs about the world of the future, out of print, where he seems to be hinting at some kind of handheld operators, called an eye Ruskin. I must look it up and parlay my observations into a postage here One of these days. As soon as I got home just after dorm I switched on or as they say, nowadays, powered up my eye Whoo. And left it to bleep and hum while I fixed a solid breakfast. This involved more eggs than you can shake a stick at, which is a goodly number of eggs. I can tell you. This is my own breakfast recipe called Hitchcock's and nightmare. Alternatively, Orwell's glut all of my many and various breakfast recipes are named after writers, painters and film directors, and I hope one day to cobble them together into a compendium, but a more urgent task was at hand. What I wondered a Dobson had to say about the poultry are that the Grand Lodge cooks in that rare a rare pamphlet. The I will history jotted like some living organism, as it tackled the bonkers babbling of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. But before sunset, I had a printout. It ran to 40 pages of densely set text, cleverly imitating the authentic look of like a stettler pamphlet direct from marigold Choo shed. I was too exhausted to read it there and there, so I shoved it into a drawer and went to bed.

Frank Key  21:07
During the night, I had that dream about the kiboko gift again. The next morning, after a breakfast I call a Claude Chabrol special. I sat down to read. I was careful to bear in mind that what I was reading was not Dobson as such, but Dobson as filtered through the eerie, inexplicable powers of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman, a different text entirely. Nonetheless, it was the nearest I could get to the pamphlet his own words. Dobson or the Wu Dobson began by listing the grand arch troops whose poultry Artie had studied. It was an incredibly long and tedious list, packed with ludvigsen videos and Hogan Holden's and Gotham Dyson, all written on bertos. Here and there, a few biographical or historical details were scattered about, but nothing about poultry yard, nor indeed about disgusting rabbits. Next came one of those dogs, sonian, digressions, sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating. This one was firmly in the latter camp, being an extended meditation upon stars and yeast. Neither which topic for pamphleteer seemed to have a clue about by the time he'd finished whispering, I was halfway through the recovered pamphlet, and still waiting to learn about its ostensible subject matter. I began to wonder if the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman had played a joke on me actually really been in contact with ectoplasmic beings from a realm beyond our puny understanding, or what she just raising. I wanted to trust her, not least because I paid good money for that back number of the Reader's Digest, from Omar purgatives, anticommunist secondhand periodical shop. But of course, I need not have worried after some closing Flim Flam about boiled yeast, the Wu Dobbs and last got to the matter in hand. Here was the sentence that made me sick bulk up right. It is patently obvious to anyone who has studied these things that all grand arch Dukes, maintaining poultry yards upon their estates around which disgusting rabbits proud, did so because of their fantastic fanatical devotion to the cause of unreason. He goes on to explain, unfortunately, this is where the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman's channels of communication with the mysterious realms seem to have broken down a tad. But I'll read it to you anyway, this is what the pamphlet says. I say patently obvious, because it's both patent and obvious. Consider the unsealed regime considering it again. Imagine yourself strutting about the corridors of the art Ducal Palace. Is your path blocked by hens it is why other hens not in their coop in the poultry yard. Hear them clucking if you could translate their clucking, into human speech, specifically hydromatic speech as spoken by quite a number of granddaughter groups. What do you think they'd be saying? eek eek, we're in fear of the disgusting rabbit to skulk about the perimeter of our yard. You might argue that rabbits are one of the last animals on earth whose method of propelling themselves hither and thither could be described as skulking. You might argue that but do you want to be seen arguing with hens in your palace corridor by one of your men or valets? Whoa, whoa, whoa, they would snare your minions later downstairs in their pantry. The old fool was arguing with hands who ever heard of such a thing? They're after they would treat you with contempt and even come to question your art dukedom. The lettered ones among them might start reading insurrectionist pamphlets produced by bearded German revolutionaries that are by far never to argue with hens in the corridor, no matter how panic stricken they appear, gather them up one by one and put them right back in back in their coop in the poultry yard. Send a rider to dash on horseback to the land grave in his distant fastners to alert him to the presence of disgusting rabbit.

His forces may sweep in within days or weeks or not at all, for you can never second guess the landgrave he has his own hands in his own poultry yard, where he argues with them all day long. For much interbreeding it is no more line has made him soft in the head. See him dribble, see him draw. See him argue frantically with this hand on that hand, hauling himself around the poultry yard on the crutches which support his with the legs, the legs of his hands or with the two as other legs of the disgusting rabbit who's around his castle? Yes, he has his own disgusting rabbits to contend with, as do all land graves and Mar graves and granddaughter troops in the Antion regime. You would do well to learn that and to cease your whining struck your corridors as you may for one day or will crumble the footmen and valets will break out of the pantry and run amok, and there will be traffic between the terrified hens and the disgusting rabbits. Oh, odious, odious, but now you have glimpsed what is to come. You must be a fierce and ruthless grand Archduke in all your finery, though it freighter tatters I will leave it to the experts judge if this is the authentic voice of Dobson or the witless practical of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. Either way, it takes us some way to build a better understanding of the hens of unreason. And that is all we set out to do in our modest way, on this autumns day.

It's nearly the end of the show for this week. But before I go, I'll read you a couple of further extracts from Mr. Keyes shorter potty brief, brief lives. book published by constable which is out a week today, first day, the first of October. So next week, instead of me reading it to you on the radio, you can read it yourself. And anyway, to end this week, we'll have the entry for Cornelius Cardew, English composer and Marxist Leninist revolutionary firebrand 1936 to 1981. In 1966, Qadri was in New York, while his wife Stella remained in London, struggling with four small children, and virtually no money in a top floor flat. Stella wrote a stream of letters to car Drew, complaining bitterly about the couple who had come to stay with her. They were helping themselves to food, not paying a penny towards the housekeeping, and leaving stellar to look after their pneumonia wracked child while they went off galavanting to switch parties, nor did they show any sign of leaving until cardroom eventually wrote a stern letter ordering them to do so. The names of this couple were Tony Cox, and his then wife, the avant garde Japanese artist, Yoko Ono. So that's one to bear in mind. Okay. That's in the book was published next week, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
