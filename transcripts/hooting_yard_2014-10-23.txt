You are indeed listening to a radio radio resonance. Right you are in DC I'm going to start again. You are indeed listening to resonance, FM, the home of radio art, but there's no art for the next half hour. There's no art on this show is just babbling. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frankie, and I'm going to babble at you artlessly for the next 27 or 28 minutes. The other day I met a man who's devoted the past several years to a singular literary project. His aim is to produce a bowdlerized version of the complete works of HP Lovecraft, and which all reference to the spine tingling of the spooky, the eldritch and the uncanny, it's expunged. I was able immediately to grasp the value of this scheme. Lovecraft is a fascinating writer, but there must be many potential readers who are deterred from his work, because quite frankly, they do not wish to get the collywobbles exercise, the spine tingling and the spooky, the Eldrick and the uncanny, and an entire new constituency of fans will be created. I asked my new friend how he went about the creation of an expurgated Lovecraft he explained that he began by simply deleting all the terrifying adjectives, adjectives, adverbs, verbs and nouns. This had the unintended consequence of rendering much of HP Lovecraft prose bitty and near incomprehensible as he put it, how passages were reduced to strings of prepositions? Like commendably brief, the resulting text lacked heft. So then he said proudly, his real work began, he realized that he could reinstate a certain amount of readability and up the word count, by replacing, for example, show golf with a pretty vase of flowers or hideous tentacles with gambling run bunny rabbits. I pointed out to him that some people, not least myself, found rabbits utterly frightening. And he promised to look again at his revisions. bid me farewell, and I sat alone at the cafe table, mercilessly correlating all the contents of my mind.

clattered up to the post office counter saw perplexed. Hello, toots. What can I do for you today? said the friendly postmaster. I am so perplexed said toots. I have lost my maytals the postmaster was hard of hearing, and had been ever since a traumatic childhood incident when he was inadvertently placed into close proximity to attacks on for the duration of a lengthy communist party rally. If you have lost your marbles, toots, you'll be wanting a psychiatrist not the postal service to repeated himself louder and with exaggeratedly precise movements of his lips. Oh, I see, said the postmaster. But what makes you think I can be of any assistance to PT went on to explain his belief that the Postal Service engaged as it was in the great work of sending and delivering sundry items all around the world was the obvious agency to consult if one wish to track down something lost. In this case, his maytals the postmaster took his point with certain reservations which he kept to himself. I will keep a lookout for them, toots he said. toots, whose saw perplexity was now etched deeper than ever upon his countenance was dissatisfied with this response. Are you not able to do something more than that? He screeched alarming in the queue behind him. Several persons among whom was escapee from the big house up on the hill. The postmaster asked not unreasonably what toots would have him do. Some kind of tracking said toot with post office dogs bloodhound tracking or tagging the sending of telegrams or telegraphed uniformed post office runners. I don't know notice is slapped up in post offices across the land, vans scouring the countryside, the full wave of the Postal Service thrown behind the surge. Let me stop you there said the postmaster while I serve this scary from big Al's up on the hill to slumped in a corner of the post office woebegone and weeping. The skimpy bought a single postage stamp, plopped it into a pocket of her apron, and trudged out and along the street past the haberdashery and the book is on the ferry Grotto, over the bridge across the canal, and along the line through the spinny up the hill to the gaunt iron gate of the big house, along the path by the turnip beds and the stone statues of Daredevil wartime airplane pilots across the lawn and down the alley along the side of the house, in through a door, tucked almost imperceptibly in a porch, down a flight of stairs into a gloomy corridor until she reached the door of her gallery. She took from a different deeper pocket of her apron, a huge Imk inserted it into the lock, turned it and pushed the door open in the pitch black of the scullery. She had the saddling, sudden rattling of chains and fetters, locking the door behind her. She flicked a switch, and a light bulb on the ceiling, cast a dim glow, revealing a huddle of scar musicians chained and fettered. I have pots and pans to scrub she announced. So my my towels, play your scar music to clear me in my drawers. And soon enough, the scullery was loud and joyful with the strains of Monkey man.

And the bloke who I met who was doing the expurgated HP Lovecraft told me that story about tooth losing his maytals and apparently it's a true story. I didn't know that. At least that's what he said. The farmer rebuked is spayed is the title of a painting by Cedric farm painter I. It's been described as his first grade dog, and as the jewel of the pointy town municipal gallery area. The work itself was destroyed in an inexplicable bird related capitalism, and today exists only in the form of a mezzotint copy by the noted mezzotint test Rex tent. tent always claimed that he made his print by sitting in front of the original painting, gazing at it for hours working steadily, but his account has been called into question by his own sister, dot tinned. In her memoir of her brother, she wrote that he cannot have sat where he said he sat having been barred from entering the Galleria, or its grounds or appurtenances by dint of insufferable pomposity. This distance in time we can never know which tent wrecks or.is telling the truth. All we have is the mezzotint itself, several thousand copies of which were printed and distributed by Rex tent devoted and possibly insane patron Walter mad. The farmer rebukes his spade is a rustic scene. It shows a dreary and rain soaked field pitted with many a puzzle. To the left, there is a tree which may be a large or box or plane or Sycamore against the trunk of which is leaning a spade at an angle of 42 degrees. It has been measured precisely by swivel eyed enthusiasts. Next to the tree and the spade inside profile is the finger of a farmer, Florida face and fat belly. One arm is raised and one finger of one puffy hand is in mid wag. The farmer appears to be shouting his head off, in what one critic has described as an unbridled an unhinged spewing forth of rancor and remonstrance. In the top left corner, silhouetted against the bleak sky, there is a bird almost certainly a small bittern, which, as other sources confirm, was the favorite bird of both rec tent, and Cedric farm painter. See painters and mezzotints wax elegiac about their favorite birds, the Journal of mezzotint and painting related orthology volume 28 number eight August 1909. My own copy of the mezzotint was unfortunately destroyed in the course of a sophisticated cocktail party, which got out of hand and swiftly descended into an unsophisticated cocktail party and pitched battle.

Just a reminder that if you want to read for yourself all the stuff that I recite on this show, you can go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org on the World Wide Web and you can spend possibly the rest of your life looking through the archives, which now go back to 2003 I think anyway, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Higgledy Piggledy, as without any order of position or direction, in huddled or jumbled confusion and Disorder, With heads and tails in any or every direction, usually contemptuous. An early citation from a new Dictionary of the terms ancient and modern of the counting crew 1699 makes explicit the reference to heads and tails, defining the word as all together as hogs and pigs lie. This pig based etymology seems to me to be thoroughly erroneous. My own exhaustive and exhausting research as exude from historical obscurity. You know what, it's been so damnably exhausting that I'm going to have to break off here to take a nap. Assume several paragraphs of zero.

Fast better, I'm refreshed and as if the nap were not enough. I've also glugged two teaspoons worth of Dr. Baxter's frenetic brain activity enhancement call deal. So, let us resume my own exhaustive and exhausting research as zoom from historical obscurity, Monsignor Higgledy and Dr. Piggledy, the one a priest and the other a physician. The spellings of their names are in accord with the Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford English Dictionary earliest citation from john florio's a world of words, or most copious and exact dictionary in Italian and English, a 1598. In this case, Hungary is spelled h i g l e d i, and Piggledy PIDLED I II. write those down in your notebook. In 1492, or there abouts. The Monsignor and the doctor were commissioned by Bruno lapu. Bell to take charge of the keep pointy town neat and tidy campaign. This may seem anachronistically modern, in both its intention and its phraseology. But Bruno lapu Bell was ever a figure who transcended the petty bombs of time. written as for example, the well known portrait of him etched by noted actor Rex van edge, in which he's clearly depicted wearing flying goggles, and a Spandau Ballet t shirt. a visionary he may have been, but Bruno lapu Bell by the terrible error of judgment in picking Higgledy Piggledy for keep pointy town neat and tidy campaign. The one was a butter fingers and the other was passing strange you know why we would today probably diagnosis clinical insanity which was which Monsignor or physician, I have not yet been able to ascertain from the documents. What they do make horribly vivid however, is that now pair of 15th century pointy towners could have been less able to make, let alone keep things neat and tidy. Wherever they went in those ancient boulevards, attempting to align things neatly and clear away clutter and chaos. They only made things worse. By the time Bruno lapu Bell put a stop to their activities, all of pointy town with a gumball of confusion with even well defined pathways crumbled and leading in jagad zigzags towards nothingness, or haystacks from the hinterland to be found plopped upside down in the middle of the town square, or horses behind the counters of pickle shops. There is a measure of truth in the observation that more than 500 years later, pointy town has never quite recovered. That's why as soon as you went to the town, even today, you become lost, lost, hopelessly lost. pigs have nothing to do with it.

Exciting news. Tarleton is back on his balcony. He is eating a plum. It is a Carlsbad plum. He gazes across the city and the wasteland into the distance. Whether Pinkie Ross it peaks of the pinky Russet mountains Shema in the haze from one of thousands is dangles a piratical earring but there is no piratical parrot on his shoulder. He has though acquired since last we met him a wooden leg telson is brief we might recall was the gougeon hue gougeon hue he did heroically losing a leg in the process. But he did not complain. He showed fortitude. I was encamped at 440 he said to himself and then at Fort toity sorry that is only meat that in forts I show fortitude. No wonder Tarleton was showered with Petunia petals by adoring peasants that remain a few petals in his hair for a long time since he shampooed it. It is a long time to since last he stood upon this balcony, eating a plum. It is so long ago that the only dimly remembers. more vivid are the memories of Fort hoity with its ostriches and bandages and zinc and 40 with champions arrayed along the crenellations and gains of spit in the gutter. It was between forts that Talton lost his leg to a crocodile. In the Middle Ages returning Crusaders brought with the meme bombed bodies of crocodiles, which were wrapped in trains and hung from the ceilings of cathedrals. Talton did not think of his gouging and hewing as a crusade, but it was, it was he spits out the plump stone into the palm of his hand, makes a fist and taking care of Elaine tosses it over the edge of the balcony, down into the shallow pool around the fountain. How many Carlsbad plump stones lie there, barely submerged. He has never once missed a toss, towels and turns and withdraws into his chamber. His head is full of squeaking imaginary backs.

I have a letter from Miss Miss Octavia funnel. And she wrote Dear Mr. Key, I'm sure I read somewhere that Dobson's companion and a man uncle marigold qu was a feral child likes a wild boy of every wrong, or Kaspar Hauser. Is this true? I think I can help this family out here. She's clearly unfamiliar with Dobson's rare and out of print pamphlet. 10 things guaranteed to drive marigold true crackers. an amusing Bagatelle which he wrote for marigolds birthday one year, it's worth quoting at length. So that's what I'm going to do now. That can be no doubt about number one on the list of things that drive marigold to crackers. countless other times I have witnessed her seizing with fury when he is mistaken for Mary gold true, the so called savage infant of splat. splat is a tiny stricken village in Cornwall, and it was here on a muggy summer's day in 19, something that a peasant pushing his Barrow of countryside filth along the line, was astonished to encounter a small child roaring and spitting and growling and scrambling in the muck. If gender was indeterminate, but bit savagery, was unquestionable. The peasant sad to say had the morals of the gutter and a heartless foul as a swamp. And they decided then and there to sell the child to a traveling circus or a zoo, plucking the child from the ditch, who shoved her onto his Barrow and traveled off towards a larger town where mountebank were known to gather. But the child best deal being that she was sank her teeth into the peasants wrist and attacked him in a whirling frenzy of bloodlust. She was knowing the hair of his head, when a kindly doctor arrived on the scene. he patted her on the head and announced their their little one, Be not afraid. I am a kindly doctor, fascinated by natural philosophy, and I shall take you to my comfortable house and see if over a period of months or years, I can instill in you the civilized qualities that were your birthright, but have been stolen from you. By no doubt, tragic circumstances. What is your name? The child how old? Ah. Said the kindly doctor, you are inarticulate. That noise you made sounded to me like a combination of a wolf and a bear with perhaps a touch of corncrake I deduce that you have been raised since you were a baby by wolves and bears and corncrakes and may have by bees and Hornets to still you must have a name child. So I shall call you marry Dr. Gold to took the child by the hand and let her to his house which stood all alone in a field outside splat. There he dunked her in a disinfectant bath, dressed her in girly clothes and embarked on a comprehensive pedagogical regime. Over the following weeks, he attempted to teach metaphysics, arithmetic, rhetoric, logic, Latin Greek bread, baking, botany, chemistry, religious instruction, conspiracy theory, merchant banking, astronomy, philology, and the rudiments of table tennis or ping pong. During this time, reporters from the splat Korea and Beagle camped out on his doorstep, filing a series of woefully inaccurate stories about like the girl like called the savage infant of splat. Her famous spread throughout Europe, and Dr. Gold drew received visits from some of the most distinguished intellectuals of the day, including capisco blanket and wubi. It was the latter, who persuaded the kindly doctor to have the gold baptized by being fully submerged in the sea off the coast of Cornwall, during which baptism she nearly drowned. She entered the booming ocean a savage infant biting and squealing and howling, wrote the doctor, and she emerged as marry gold to a pious Christian child. This is a selective account of course, the doctor makes no mention of the drenched and spluttering top two was fished out of the water by a passing trawler.

Nor does he admit that the pious Christian child, remaining carb could be savage for the rest of her long, long life. In spite of the doctors lessons, to which he soon added physics, geology, alchemy, pole vaulting, paleontology, entomology, knitting, forensic medicine, vexor, lalaji, Dianetics and pottery, the savage infant of splat became a savage adolescent, and in turn a savage adult. She celebrated her 26th birthday by creeping into Dr. Gold to his bedroom as he slept, and smothering him with a pillow. There after she spent her days crashing around like a wild maniac, as the ones comfortable splat house fell into ruin about her. When she died, craggy an ancient decades later, she had learned nothing, nothing except to speak two words, the same two words with that were the full extent of the wild boy of Ave Ron's vocabulary, God and milk.

And that's the end of this week show. I had, in fact, read that piece before, possibly about six years ago. But so if you're a longtime listener, you'll have heard it before. If not, you won't, but I didn't change your word. And I'll be back reading you more stuff. Mostly brand new, if not all next, same time next week. Bye bye.
