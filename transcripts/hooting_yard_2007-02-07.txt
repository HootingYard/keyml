Hello, this is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for half an hour. I'd like to begin with a one day there was a I want to begin I'm going to start again. I'm going to start again because I've completely screwed up in the beginning of this show. This is hooting yard on the air. Once there was a chump, and there was a flapper and they sat in a rowing boat in the middle of a vast, vast lake. The lake was so big it might as well as been a see for neither the Trump nor the flapper could see the shore. The Trump thought he was a flop, but the flapper knew she was a flapper. I am a flapper said the flapper and you are a camp. I am not a Trump said the Trump insulted I am a flop. Either way said the flapper. Hand me that or it is time we rode home for Look, the sun is setting and if we do not row home, we will be plunged into darkness out here in the middle of the vast, vast lake. Such a prospect gives me the collywobbles. Now you might protest that a world weary Demi mundane flapper is the last person in the world to get the collywobbles and you would probably be correct. Be that as it may, the Trump being a chump took her at her word and handed her the oar and grabbed hold of the other or himself. And together they began to row. The flapper road with insouciance ease and the Trump rode like a camp That is to say, ineptly, so ineptly there instead of rowing home, they've wrote to the wrong side of the vast, vast lake. That is how the chump and the flapper found themselves at nightfall. Surrounded by a gaggle of murderous thugs lumbering about on the jetty of an ill starred fishing village. There was much grunting from the thugs, most of whom were wielding clubs, and their clubs were spattered with blood and brains and the Lord knows what else. I think it would be a good idea for you to essay a tad of champery to distract the thugs, said the flapper to the Trump. Surely you mean a tad of fuckery protested the Trump. I mean, what I say snapped the flapper and be quick about it. Or we will be bashed by brutes wiping his hands on his plus fours that Trump was about to engage in diverting company when a police car screeched interview behind the murderous thugs and out stepped Detective Inspector kargh Pan? Yes, the so called spindly copper had not after all, plummeted to his doom over a waterfall in some Ruritanian Princeton, for he was here in this godforsaken fishing village, accompanied as ever by his Troika of deceptively diffident bloodhounds. Bam, bam, and ooh bummed who us on a moonlit jetty ended the criminal careers of the camp and the flapper cargo pan, place them in manacles and bundled them into the boot of his car before driving off at inhuman speed up into the hills, leaving the thugs to smash the rowing boat and the rowing boat oars to smithereens.

How can ye stooped mendicant to my gate. I am good king Wenceslas and I am looking out and I can see you pour and shivering in your rags, for the snow is deep and crisp, and even. There are not even any tracks in the frozen white expanse, such as would be made by wolves or bears. Wait there at my gate, oh, wreck. And shortly I shall descend from my castle ramparts and join you in the snow. So said old hollub on the feast of Steven, for he had rented a room and a castle and was getting carried away by his new surroundings. Those of you who've been paying attention will know that old halb was the cantankerous Training Manager of fictional athletes Bob needs to evolve, and thus far more likely to be found puffing cigarettes at the side of a running track than loading it from the Tower of a splendid middle European castle. And yet here he was a battered tin crown on top his potato shaped head, pretending to be monarch of all he surveyed, though all he could survey was covered in snow, including the mendicant. It was not true, however, that the snow was deep and crisp, and even. It was certainly the first two. But no one could in all conscience call it even for here and there, the snow had drifted into clumps. simas hires a swarm, and it was beside one such one sized clump, that the mender can stooped. Now, unbeknown to old hollub, this mendicant was known as the natterjack man, and he was well known in the vicinity of the castle, he had earned his sobre K, because he had the face and have manners of a toad, though none of the hallucinatory properties of a toad skin, which if licked, can provoke visions, depending, of course, on the type of toad.

Up in his rented chambers, old halab straighten the crown on his head, and prized his feet into a pair of galoshes. Between these extremities, his garb or Raymond was such that we shall pass over it in silence, for we do not wish to frighten the tinies clutching a lamb thorn in his grimy fist and coughing violently. The legendary athletics coach stumbled down a stone staircase impeded every few steps by the crows, bats and badgers whose domain this was. It was that kind of castle, reaching the grand entrance hall at long last toes crushed by the constricting galoshes. Old halabi took a moment to gather himself. He was not a sentimental man, but he felt a dowel Pang in his breast as he pictured himself standing at the edge of the race track at Oh hooligans Wharf, around which fictional athlete Bob needs to vote would sprint, round and round and round, unstoppable. rashly the club should pay six months rent in advance faze castle chamber and sent Bob Nick tavole off to a basket tree weaving compound hi in some distant hills, where his sprained ankle would be rested and righted. The old tyrant had not foreseen how grievously he would miss his fictional charge, nor that he would spend his castle days moping and splenetic and endlessly removing the crows which perched on his tin crown, as one perch now, calling at his splitting volume. Old halb reached up and grab the bird by its black throat and tossed it nun to gently towards the stairwell. Then he aimed and activated his pocket pod, and the huge iron doors of the castle swung open, eerily silent, and he thumped out into the snow. On the feast of Steven.

The NASA jack man still stooped by the swan high clump of snow, awaiting the man he thought was good king Wenceslas. For a begging bowl, he carried a plastic beaker, which he had found discarded outside the pie shop and canteen at the End of the Lane that led from the castle to the stinking cluster of hovels where the local mendicants spent much of their time lying around groaning and whimpering. In truth, they were rather well appointed hovels, each with its own spigot and cat flap and guttering, the latter of gleaming new stainless steel installed by the local stainless steel guttering chaps, and paid for by the mendicants themselves with the proceeds from the sale of their hot salty tears to a sinister ex Princess, who haunted the wild and horrible Woods beyond the hovels. hailed stooping mendicant, yelled old hollub in what he thought was a kingly tone. stoop no more for I bring the sucker for NASA jack man on the stooped and pushed his black plastic beaker towards the king. By God, you look like a toad. cried old halabi, aghast. Then he collected himself and remembered his manners. Still, that is no reason why you cannot become a top championship athlete, a for the sucker that the wild wily old coach had in mind was that he could take this record beggar and transform him through a rigorous exercise regime into a world beating sporting legend weighed down with medals and trophies. The natterjack man made no reply, but pointed to his withered leg, and then his other withered leg, and then to his withered arm, and then his other withered arm, and then sort of distorted himself in such a manner that his general weirdness was gruesomely apparent. But the counterfeit good king Wenceslas simply laughed in his face. I am the king, he shouted. Do you think for one minute, you puny wretch, that I have not the power to turn you into a pole vaulting champion of global renown. I have no doubt in my astonishingly incisive mind that you can become a credit to T mahalo Bob. And he grabbed hold of the natterjack man's ragged sleeve and propelled him towards the nearest athletic stadium 20 miles distant, and put him through his paces. It is a curious fact that only upon his deathbed 30 years later, the winner of no fewer than 16 pole vaulting gold medals, famed beyond common sense, throughout tan Tara beam and pointy town and all points westward, learned for the first time that his benefactor was not nor ever had been good king Wenceslas but was none other than the irascible and chained smoking old halb. The surprise felled him or would have felt him had he not already been lying on his back, close to death, muffled by bandages in the bedroom of his converted hovel in the shadows of the castle upon which snow had fallen, in which crows and bats and badges had swooped and scuffled where a tin crown and a pair of galoshes could still be found high on the highest shelf in the highest chamber, higher than even the natterjack man had ever voted in his prime.

Today I am wearing the socks of Pepin chewed, and so a tired I shall stride forth decisively. There is of course, a risk that curves will snap to my socks and kittens to possibly for the socks of Pepin to emit odors which convulsively befuddle our four footed friends, though they remain undetectable by the human nose. Also, I've been told by my spy at the lab who keeps me up to date on such matters. It is best to wear a pair of tough Uruguayan Airforce boots over the socks of Pep intrude. This will go some way to deter occurs and kittens. And that's one decisive progress through the boulevards meets with less travail. You may ask where I am going so decisively through the boulevards of this important town. I am going to the post office, I last, unlike the post office in Plovdiv. It is not emblazoned with a mural painted by the Plovdiv fivesome, but nonetheless, it is a very fine post office. Outside it on the Esplanade is a flagpole with a big blue flag flying a topic. The doors are made of some weird iridescent metal and swoosh open as one approaches, having thrown off any trailing curves and kittens. I am going to cause those doors to swoosh and I shall make my decisive strides into the post office lobby, where a cadet in a cadet cap and tunic will point me towards a queue leading to a counter behind which I know in the innermost fibers of my being there will be a tally stick person ready to sell me some posted related items. When the exchange has been made, I will exit again through the swooshing doors, having saluted the cadet and I shall stride decisively into the Esplanade and gaze at the flag atop the flagpole and I shall not flinch. And that was an extract from 40 visits to the post office by Dobson out of print.

Before moving on, I think I should point out that the Plovdiv fivesome mentioned in that last piece did in fact exist. People often accuse me of making things up, but the Plovdiv fivesome and we're a group of five artists in Plovdiv, one of whom painted a magnificent mural on the post office. If you go to the hosting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org, you can actually see a photograph of the post office. Unfortunately, the photograph was taken in the 1930s before the mural was painted, but you can still see the Plovdiv post office where that piece took place. And if you do visit the website, you will notice that it has for 2007 it has an entirely new look, and is now a kind of standard blog. And you can leave comments and indexing is better and all sorts of things. So do go and visit and read and leave comments. And this is called bronchitis person's helicopter journey. And it's a story set in an Islamic State. handbook handed me that you gore said the molar the Mufti snatched the Google from the ayatollah and handed it to the Mullah. Are you going to take the Google to the Grand Vizier? asked the Mufti that I am I said the Mullah, turning on the heel of his floppy booty and exiting through a rich brocade curtain. The Ayatollah stroked his tremendous hairy beard and looked at Mufti Do you have your portable metal Tapping Machine on you? he asked. And on seeing the Mufti nod, he added, I want you to contact them resin. firmer resin cried the Mufti dumbfounded. The same, said the ayatollah leaving the Mufti to tap a message to the meridian. The Ayatollah went out into the courtyard, almost hidden behind the luxurious Mimosa Japonica, candy Taft Mater lupins and ox lip. whirring robot's version of Big Bill broonzy was playing the blues. The Ayatollah was tolerant of music, so long as it was mournful. He sat down on a mat and ran his fingers through his hair he beard again. Meanwhile, at the Grand visitors palace, the Grand Vizier was impatiently awaiting the Muller with the Google. Last week he had volunteered to undergo ideological reeducation. All the talk in the palace now was of the correct application of mouth say today I thought the Grand Vizier wanted the molars Google to add to his collection of baubles, the significance of which was only now beginning to dawn on him. He popped a filbert into his mouth, and continued pacing up and down on his big and attractive carpet, his impatience growing just as the ayatollah was stroking his superb, hairy beard for the umpteenth time, the Mufti joined him in the courtyard, the Mufti had an abnormal growth on his forehead. strikingly disconcerting news, he announced the move as in has bronchitis. The ayatollahs let go of his beard. Hmm, disconcerting Indeed, he said, Go and switch off the broonzy robot, I need a bit of peace and quiet to think. In January, the remote control device for the robot had been left out in the rain, and no one had been able to repair it. So the Mufti had to fight his way through lilac flocks could Tony Aster, hollyhocks and Erica to reach the knob on the side of the machine to switch it off. Now the only sound in the courtyard was the insistent call of a corncrake. Far, far away. Suddenly, the ayatollahs ceased cogitating and spoke Mufti, he said, there is a helicopter idling on the helipad. Go to it, fetch the murzin then fly him to the Grand visitors palace. That is my clearly considered plan of how we should proceed. Excuse me. And so the scene was set for that historic meeting in the palace. When the Grand Vizier, the Mullah the bronco move is in and the Mufti sat on demands in the room of baubles, their attentions fixed upon the Google

Rex tense mezzotint of the occasion of work of the imagination, for of course he was not present is one of his greatest mezzotints. It took him four years to complete it. And when it was done, he gave it as a gift to the ayatollah, who framed it and hung it on the wall of the courtyard, where it was soon obscured by burgeoning fleabane Veronica eglantine, hibiscus, poppies and daisies and Lady slipper an old man's beard, by saxifrage, and Narcissus, by orchids by briars by creeping Jenny and viola, and it hangs there still, though, the ayatollah is long dead, and the faraway corncrake is no more.

And this probably the final story, I think this week is about an invisible detective. Not to be confused with detective Detective Inspector karg pan who you met earlier on. When I zoomed all the books from the buried library under the big field of cement, one of the volumes they found was the first edition of murder in the merch by chlorine Winslow. You probably know Winslow as the author of fangs in the mist, her most famous work, the one that won prizes, the one that's So thousands of copies, the one that was turned into an opera booth by booth. Booth himself is an intriguing character, but I don't want to get sidetracked. Perhaps I'll read to you about him another time. About his many operas, opera booth sand opera buffers, soap operas and light operas. About his pet Curlew does Mondo once savage but domesticated by booths. I'm going to start that sentence again. Perhaps I'll read to you about him another time about his many operas, opera booths and Opera woofers soap operas and light operas about his pet Curlew. Dez mondo, once savage but domesticated by booth according to his own bird taming plan, based on Edward de Bono's revolutionary six hats system, about his love of both chocolate swiss roll and lemon meringue pie about the booth gate scandal, about the time boof, visited a gigantic dam in a distant land, a dam that didn't work and I and how he never went back, even though the dam managers implored him to about Desmond's birdseed preferences, about six hats of different colors, and about booths musical adaptation of fangs in the mist by chlorine, Winslow, but all that can wait, because I want to tell you about murder in the Merck murder in the murk is as its title indicates a murder mystery. It features Winslow's, so called invisible detective, invariably known only as the invisible detective. Some critics of poo pooed Winslow's prose, particularly her dialogue for passages such as this one. This is for murder in the Merc there are things that creep up on the face of the earth Dale Winton, that is best you. Ah. heavens above the invisible detective screams Dale Winton the invisible detectives ruddy plump, ever reliable assistant. What is the matter? Fear not Dale Winton. I was merely saying get to keep you on your toes said the Invisible detective. David Dale Winton mopped his brow with a large red, yellow green, blue and black embroidered cotton neck a tree from Peru. For all her leaden pros, however, chlorine Winslow was a supreme divisor of plots in murder in the Merc a clerk armed with a dark lurking in the murk goes berserk murdering many. Winslow gives each of the victims a quirk for example. The first to be slain has a tattoo of several coumarins on his torso. The second is a smarmy brilliant team get who bathes in as his milk and toasts his crumpets over the fire using a replica of the magic five pronged fork of 10. Tara been part of the cutlery treasures in the museum at or near ag the third victim is a poultry cow poke poultry man as we follow in the invisible footsteps of the invisible detective and the invisible detectives assistant Dale Winton. The twists and turns and thrills pile up page after page just like in a well thumbed library book you may remember reading when you were young and feckless and callow our last, like Dobson's many pamphlets, murder in the merch is out of print.
