You are indeed listening to resonance 104 point four FM. This is hooting out on the air. And my name is Frank key and I'm going to read to you for just under half an hour. The chief reason Plutarch and Petrarch never met in a he man wrestling bound is a matter of simple chronology. Consider their dates of birth and death Plutarco 46 to 120 ad and Petrarch 1304 to 1374 ad, more than 1000 years separates their days on our little planet. And none of the fantastic time travel contraptions dreamed up by sci fi writers and visionaries has ever been built, at least not in any working form. had one been made, then Plutarco could have been a wizard into the future, or Petrarch into the past and suitably attired, or possibly naked and greased like the wrestlers of certain ancient civilizations. The pair could have entertained the crowds, displaying all sorts of he-man wrestling holes, and grunting and throwing each other around the ring. If their bout was fought according to a brutal set of rules, someone may have needed to stand by with a pail and a mop to clean up any shade blood and someone else, preferably a child urge and would be needed to play splints or any broken bones. It's unlikely that either Plutarch or Petrarch would agree to fight to more genteel wrestling rules, for they would not wish to appear namby pamby to their thousands upon thousands of supporters, whose side you come down on depends to a large extent upon your cranium blips. If you spent much of your adult life poring over the parallel lives and the muralidhara, scribbling a lot of notes in the margins or in a pad, then you will probably cheer on Plutarco and hope that sickening crunching noise you heard is not one of his bones being shattered. On the other hand, if you'd like nothing better than to curl up in a hammock with a copy of de Amadeus, who triggers gray fortunei or the secrete them, then you will be backing Petrarch and wanting to see that pail filled with the blood of Plutarch. Or, if you have wasted your life, and never read a word by either of these Titans, you may be swayed by say Plutarco beard or by petrarchan hat. The position you will not want to be in is one of neutrality. For you, we'll see how the adherence of both the big p arcs are violently partisan, with a last for gore kept apart by a fence of iron steaks. Not to join one marble The other is to miss out on the frenzy of the day. And in any case, you will have to choose to sit in one section of the ringside and in spite of their screaming and just stick you lating and spitting. The mobs do sit quite neatly even on their benches or their bucket seats. No one wants to spoil the view of the ring. We're in Plutarco and Petrarch grand forearms smashes and trip each other up and stamp about in a great show of he man grappling. Once you've plumped for your campaign, you will want to take out a bet with one of the ringside bookies gambling it's time travel wrestling bounces big and sometimes ugly business punters scuffles tend to break out and rampant bookie hounds are unleashed. These are fearsome dogs, each one individually clone from the DNA of Subarus or whatever Subarus is equivalent to DNA is that will be a matter for the pathologist and it's not a good idea to get embroiled in their arguments for you would soon go loopy. The bookies set their bookie hounds on any punter scuffling or any punter they just don't like the look of but carry yourself with grace and good humor. And you also have no problem placing your bet, whether it is on Plutarch or Petrarch. This is not of course a he man wrestling match to the death for both writers need to return at some point to their own times or be bruised and bloodied and broken. If for any reason one or both of them were not plopped back into their own. Small world,

whether it be in Boucher or diretso, or they're about there would be a hideous juddering panic inducing crumble ment of the space time continuum with unforeseen consequences. One such consequence, weirdly, might be that you wake up in the morning to discover the world is run by giant hamsters, and all because after their close fought he man wrestling about Plutarco and Petrarch wandered off together out of the ring, and forgot to return to the holy fictitious time machine at the appointed our giant hamsters in charge, it's one of multi fold possibilities. But while I suspect we would all wish to avoid, however attractive the idea of the two literary giants hobnobbing as they vanish over the horizon, arm in arm, it really is important to bundle both of them back or forward to their own times, for the good of us all, except perhaps the hamsters.

I went from within hota cuxhaven by way of pondless end, for the journey I wore upon my head, a hat woven from the hair of gorgeous hairy beasts, and a pair of goggles. Otherwise, I was dressed in the sort of suit you might see Edward G. Robinson wearing in a film noir with accompanying Spats. It was suggested to me that I might take in nunhead and snodland along the way, but I had no time I had no time. Other than the sea crossing for which I commanded a skiff and its Skipper, I walked the entire route. Whenever I became exhausted, I slept upon the ground under the bowl of night. I would like to say that I grew familiar with the stars, but I did not. Unless it was cloudy as it often was, I could see countless stars twinkling above me, but they appeared randomly scattered, and I was never able to discern any patterns. I always woke up with strands of hay in my hair. Wherever I slept. I used my gorgeous woven hat of hair as a pillow. So while I was walking rather than cycling, I carried with me a bicycle pump. Often I pumped it, pointing it ahead of me as an exercise drill, and also as a means of dispersing gangs of gnats or movies hovering in the air. Sometimes, I fancied I could hear their faint insect shrieks as they were washed out of my path. I refreshed myself with water from duck ponds. I tried to keep a steady pace. There were times when I felt the bile rising in my throat. Whenever this happened, I stopped walking, sat on the ground, took my journal from the pocket of my film noir suit and wrote a memorandum. Here is an example. I am no longer in Wivenhoe 10 minutes ago, walking along a bosky Lane line by what I think a plane trees I pumped the pump at a cloud of minges scattering them. Shortly afterwards, I felt the bile rising in my throat. Above me The sky is wonderfully blue and dotted with Linux swooping. Tonight it will be dotted with stars. The stars do not swoop they stay where they are far away in the cold universe so far away that the limits can never reach them. And nor can I but I can reach cuxhaven by way of ponders end and must do so quickly. While there is still time. The act of writing in my journal always made the bile subside and I was able to press on. When it was humid my goggles steamed up. I carried on walking as if in a mist. When I came to a stream or a real I would take off the goggles and get them briefly in the water and wipe them dry on one of my film knife sleeves. Sometimes a true engulfing mist would descend. Then I would get down on my knees even if where I was was muddy and take from my pocket my little wooden God and prop it against the stone. And the secret. Here is an example of such besieging. Oh little wooden God propped up against the stone Don't I beseech you to sweep away this engulfing mist and to make visible my path so that I may walk on fearlessly towards cuxhaven by way of ponders end? Uber goober. himmelfarb, Farber goober. The last four words were my incantation, designed to assuage my little wooden God and have it do my bidding. My bidding was always done, for the air would clear sooner or later, and if the land was flat, I could see for miles. One day, I was able to see ponders end far in the distance, and on another day I saw the sea, and once I was on the sea being skipped across it by an energetic Skipper in his skiff. I saw cuxhaven just in time I paid the skipper to skip me across the sea. He refused to give me otherwise.

Frank Key  10:56
I had no cash, no checkbook, no debit or credit card, not even shelves or beads or trinkets. But I had honey along my journey from Wivenhoe to the coast by way of ponders and I had paused whenever I passed an apiary and snaffled honey from beehives. I collected it in pouches strung around my waist attached to a cord hidden under my film was suit. Some of the honey I ate to keep myself from fainting. But I was careful to keep some aside for I did not expect to be skipped across the sea for nothing. My offer to pay the skipper in honey was met with great civility, even glee. I knew that if ever I made the return journey from cuxhaven to Wivenhoe by way of ponders and perhaps able to take him nunhead and snodland. Given that I would no longer be pressed for time, I would be accosted by several irate beekeepers, demanding recompense for their stolen honey. I have time enough in cuxhaven to work out a way to repay them. If time passed, and my head remained empty of ideas, I could prop my little wooden guard against a cuxhaven stone and beseech it for a brainwave. If all else failed, I could stay in cuxhaven and never go back to Wivenhoe through all the days of my life. Yeah, conscience told me this was wrong. It was one thing to be holed up in cuxhaven quite another to be holed up in cuxhaven tormented by guilt that good honest beekeepers had been robbed by my own honey snaffling hands. Yes, it was true that I bought a bee stings, but I had to suck the venom and spat it out and rubbed my hands with doc leaves. I still had doc in my pocket. Should the bees of cuxhaven have at me with their stings? I hope they would not for our resolve not to take their honey. In cuxhaven I had sausages.

Here's Episode One of an exciting detective story. plump crumpled costume gumshoe Smedley blabble Pang was in a proper fix. It was the sort of fixed private detectives tend to find themselves in. The wind had blown his hat clean away and his gun was jammed. And he was trapped behind some bins in an alleyway. And the rough tough thug he had been pursuing was closing in on him. Armed with an unjammed gun full of bullets. It looked like curtains for black Pang. He could hear distant sirens. But the cops would be speeding to a different crime in a different part of the picture postcard country village where blabble Pang plied his lonely trade, a trade which often filled him with disgust at the iniquities of his fellow villagers. Sometimes he was actually physically sick. Ping, a bullet zipped past the bins and struck a piece of municipal battery which had been uprooted from its spot outside the butcher shop and dumped in the alleyway. It was a steel and led representation of Leica the pioneering Soviet space dog. The statue was unpopular with the villagers, most of whom loathe the Soviet Union and canine life forms and space travel in equal measure. Probably because of the curriculum taught in the village Community Education hub. from infancy they were brainwashed by the theist pedagogue who ran the place with it was said an iron fist in an even more iron glove. This man was plump and crumpled and costumers are in peril detective. A resemblance not accidental, for he was blackhole pangs papar the relationship between the two was fraught. The papar had always opposed Smedley his decision to set himself up as a private eye, wanting him instead to join an anti Soviet dog strangling space rocket sabotaging pressure group, but the sun followed his own lights. And now they had brought him to this dingy alleyway where he was likely to perish in a hail of bullets fired by the unjammed gun toting rough tough thug. Is it really curtains for Smedley black or Pang? Or will he escape and undignified death behind some bins? Will with crisis force him to reconsider his life choices and to conclude that his power had been right all along? Will will thugs gun gum suddenly jam to find out in the next episode of our exciting cereal story, curtains for blabble Pang

there is a pavilion by the shore I do not go there anymore. I used to visit every day on my clumping horse with its rattling Dre, and I'd hammer my fists upon the door of the pavilion set beside the shore. But I do not go there anymore. I cannot go there anymore. I used to clump along the lane line by beach and large and plain but something went wrong in my brain. And now I languish in the drain. I languish in a drainage ditch, I'm smeared with grease and tar and pitch. I've lost the use of my lower limbs, and at the mercy of Vernon's winds. All sorts of vermin suck my bladder Xilai sprawling in the mud, and others know my skin and bones while I grown my dramatic groans. Above me, a hot air balloon will be arriving very soon, I'll be winched up by a length of rope and washed with disinfectant soap. The balloonist will sing arousing hymns to cure my withered lower limbs and will hover in the boundless sky eating a snack of lemon meringue pie. Then I'll be dumped back on the line a few tweaks putting right my brain and then I shall return once more to the bright Pavilion by the shore I'm sure there's something before I go that you're very keen to know the balloonists name Don't be a clot.

clutching a bag of feathers in his sweaty fist the nameless miscreants stocked along the towpath of the canal. It was a paper bag. It was a stinking canal into which thoughtless gets dumped such debris as toffee apple wrappers and cartons and bent bits of metal. The feathers in the miscreants bag were the feathers of swans. He had not plucked them himself, but stumbled upon them. A pile of Swan feathers swept into where he by the side of the canal a mile or so south, where there had been a short lived Swan war earlier in the day. The feathers had been scattered and swept together by a broom wielded by the lock keeper. The lock keeper was the father of the miscreant, the long lost father. He did not know the miscreant was his son, nor did the miscreant know the lock keeper was his father. In physical appearance, there was nothing to connect them. The one was in probably tall and loose jointed and land jord like a giant the other cubby and squat, morally to a chasm lay between them, for the lock keeper was civic minded and held down a steady job and used his broom to sweep up that which was scattered alongside the canal. Be the feathers of swans, or the discarded wrappings of toffee, apples and other confectionery. The miscreant, by contrast, was a miscreant, who would if given a broom, use it not to sweep up rubbish but to beat about the head of someone weaker than he whom he could rob the miscreant had not stuffed feathers into a paper bag for any motive of beautifying the canalside. He had simply taken them as miscreants will take opportunistically, anything they can take. He saw the swan feathers in a pile, and thought to himself that he could sell them to a dishonest milliner of his acquaintance. This millionaire he knew would decorate his hat with all sorts of goodies of dubious provenance. His customers never asked questions, not even when their heads grew, boils and sores, because they are hat harbored toxic elements, the milliner was too careless to decontaminate. A ruthian might sell him a box of beads for cash and the milliner would stitch the beads into a hat and sell the hat or neither know nor care that the box of beads had been robbed from a hazardous waste compound. So the miscreant was confident he could sell the bag of feathers to the dishonest milliner. Even though the swan war was occasioned by disturbance in the brains of the swans, caused by weird turquoise sludge through which they had glid so gracefully some hours earlier. The sludge was almost unbelievably poisonous. It had been dumped in the canal and in nearby ponds by boffins, bad boffins, who were engaged in secret and fiendish experiment in their lab. One of these boffins was the cousin of the lock keeper. There had been much interbreeding over the course of an tallied generations in this part of the land. The Milner shared a bloodline with the buff into and thus with the lock keeper, and thus with the miscreant, there was even talk in the tavern of squalid couplings with swans in the past when people knew no better there's been traffic with beings aquatic, an old school might matter staring gloomily into his tankard. Only the most observant might note the feathers visible when he hitched up his trousers, or the way he waddled slightly as he left the tavern, later heading into the night to none knew where, and was that a faint splash that could be heard, not so distant within minutes of his leaving. It is tempting when writing of swans and boffins and canals to regurgitate great chunks of prose written on these topics by the acknowledged masters, men like Dobson and defend z and women like Kathy Meldrum, it's a temptation which must be fought and defeated. Partly in respect for the copyright laws and partly from sheer pomposity. One must breathe through one's nose in an actually way and make words with World bear. One must breathe through one's nose in and actually weigh and make a world with words of one's own. The fact that that last sentence is a direct quotation from definity is neither here nor there, and probably the reason I fluffed it at a guilt.

The toxic sludge dumped by the boffin was a byproduct of the experiments going on in the lab. The purpose of these experiments was monstrous and related in some ways to the matter mattered by the old stir in the tavern. Not all boffins are miscreants by any means, but some are on the bad boffin whose daily duty it was to roam the canal side of the pond, pumping hazardous sludge into the waters was one such he was impotent in his criminality, not carrying a jot if it was witnessed by innocence. He was of the view that all souls are besmirched, that guilt gnaws away at the innards of everybody in this part of the land with a history of sorted breathing. He may have been correct. Justice not all boffins are miscreants, nor are all miscreants boffins, for example, the nameless miscreant with his paper bag of feathers was no boffin. He has a tiny brain, and one which did not always work properly, not due to contact with toxic sludge, but rather because of repeated blows to the head received from other miscreants once upon a time in his fighting days. Had he been a buffoon of any kind, he might have devised a way of resolving the dilemma that faced him now, as he stalked along the canal towpath for his way was blocked by a gaggle of swans. Recently at war, the swans were Pepe. With adrenaline, their aggression by no means diminished. a truce with each other struck. They turned their cold, horrifying eyes on the miscreant whose approach was impertinent. How one wishes it were meet to read out a screed by hackie Meldrum here in her magnificent compendium of violent Swan anecdotic. She relates dozens of instances, not unlike this confrontation. Some of her tales even take place alongside canals or be it that in her world the canals are clean and well tended the lock keepers need not go brooming about and miscreants are few and far between. It is true that more than one bad boffin hos interview in her 500 pages, but their sins are not of a sludge dumping character. The badness of Hattie's boffins is limited to Swan cruelty, or one should say attempted Swan crawl t with one exception. And in that case, the boffin is a blast FEMA had our paper bag cluttering miscreants known that deep in his past, there had been several occurrences of Congress with swans and other waterfowl, he might have borrowed into the nooks and crevices of his tiny brain to deploy some atavistic sound or gesture with the effect of placating the swans blocking his path. But he knew nothing of his past. He did not even know his own father, who at that very moment was coming towards the swans from the rear, having swept up with his broom, a couple of tin cans and straight toggles torn from a duffle coat. The lock keeper was returning to his lock keepers hat for tea and toast, his broom over his shoulder, his lips pursed in the whistling of a happy, happy tune. So, we have a gang of swans, rancorous swans, they're a night savagery, compounded by the effect of the traces of toxic sludge still present in their systems. Their malevolence focused upon a hapless miscreants carrying a paper bag full of Swan feathers, destined for a dishonest milliner unseen by the swans because behind them, and not one of them looks back comes a lanky man with a broom that there will be violence packing, bashing blood, screeching lacerations, splashing, all in the dapple of sunlight by the side of the canal along it to towpath is it would appear inevitable. We expect the swans to attack the miscreant, the lock keeper to attack the swans. The outcome of course, being beyond our wit to foresee oblivious to their parts. The boffin is siphoning sludge into a pannier, the milliner is selling infected buttons onto a cap. So make no mistake, these two cannot be forgotten in the telling of the tale. Hattie Meldrum for one would have done more than sketched them in, you would get potted biographies as likely as not.

There is a moment in all anecdotes age where we can stop as if freezing a frame in a Motion Picture. Some say events are foretold in the stars. Even if we disparage such twaddle. It remains the case that sometimes circumstances are such that we're convinced we know what is about to happen. Ah, but we forget, we forget in the present instance, that there is another fellow who plays a part. At the very moment the swans are about to launch their attack on the miscreant. The same moment the lock keeper takes his broom from his shoulder ready to attack the swans. There is a gurgling in the canal. Bubbles disturb the filthy surface and with a mighty splash emerging from the depths comes the old stir the matter man from the tavern now transformed Half Man Half Swan, gigantic and he it enrapt the lock keeper and the miscreant and all the swans within the fold of its enormous beating wings. It holds them close, close enough almost to suffocate them, but it does not suffocate them. It holds them whole. And I hope you're held whole by a giant half man, half Swan, or something similar. That's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
