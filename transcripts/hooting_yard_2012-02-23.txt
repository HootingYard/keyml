Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Putting out on the air is the sort of radio arm of the hooting yard global domination Foundation, or something. There's a website at hooting yard.org there are six quantum six paperback books and other merchandise you can even buy hooting your badges. And soon you'll be able to buy hooting yard t shirts, when I've got my act together, as the young people say, and sometimes they say the hooting yard quarterly, a new publication in paperback format. So that's something to look forward to. Anyway, that is the that so far is hooting yard, global domination, enterprises, GMH, or whatever were called, and so on with the radio arm part of it this week shooting out on the air. There may be circumstances in which you wish to ascertain whether your dog is barking up the wrong tree. I would No, I don't keep a dog myself. But I can imagine a situation where such knowledge could prove critical. If I speak of the matter in the abstract, that's because of a total lack of hands on dog based experience on my part. Some might argue that I'm precluded from pronouncements about the issue, if we can call it an issue by dint of this lack, but I beg to differ much as a dog might beg for a bone from his master's table. Note that in spite of a deep ignorance of dogs in their ways, I'm yet able to pluck from the storehouse of vivid illustrative example of common dog or dog like behavior to get my point across. Right those who scoff be hushed, so we can get on with it. Though for present purposes, we need consider only an abstract dog barking abstractedly up an abstract tree. I find that concrete examples can be a boon to the dimwit Not that I think for one minute anyone listening to this is a dimwit who understand, but it's best to be on the safe side, and a Scribbler, never knows if or when his words may fall into the clutches of a dumb debate. So for our examples, let us take one dog, and four trees and Mastiff say, and a pine and a large and a sycamore, and a witch Elm. However, unlikely it may be in the real world, let's just say there is in the middle of nowhere, that is in a vast and otherwise featureless flat expanse of land, a row of four trees planted in a straight line, equidistant with roughly six yards between them, blocked everything else out of your mind. Well, everything except the dog, which you need to remember, though, is not yet entered the scene. So far, we just have the line of trees, the pine and the large and the sycamore, and the witch Elm. We could have a line of more or slightly fewer trees, but four is a manageable number for the dimwit. Now look, here comes a monkey scampering towards the trees at high speed. I didn't mention the monkey earlier, partly because I didn't wish to overtax your brain, and partly because in any case, it will soon be out of sight. The monkey You see, is being pursued by the dog, the massive and is hurtling pell mell towards the line of trees up the trunk of one of which it will climb with breathtaking monkey agility, and then conceal itself in the high leafage. This truly accomplished the monkey is as promised, out of sight. Now, enter the dog panting in hot pursuit of the monkey. Those of you who are keen on dogs may wish at this point to form a closer bond with our abstract massive, so let us call it

Desmond. Imagine Desmond's now stopping short of the line of Trees. It is intelligent enough to realize that the monkey must be hidden high up in either the pine or the large, or the sycamore, or the witch Elm, but not sufficiently savvy to know just yet which one I should point out here that I have no opinion either way on the intelligence of dogs, nor do I have a clue where about in the hierarchy of canine intelligence, the Mastiff can be placed, as compared to say, a boxer or a daxon. Let us credit Desmond with enough news to realize that, as the monkey is no longer visible anywhere in the vast featureless flat expanse of land, it must have climbed and hidden in the leafy driven one of the trees. Remember, Desmond, Danny, an abstract dog after all. We now come to the nub of the matter. Desmond thinks that by barking at the foot of the trunk of the tree atop which the monkey is hiding, he can somehow persuade the monkey to climb down and deliver itself into his Desmond's waiting pause. At least, I assume that's what he's going through the head of any dog that barks up any tree at its quarry. Whether this is sensible behavior is another matter entirely. Quite frankly, if I was the monkey, I'd stay put. But we must deal with the world it is not as it ought to be. And in the world as it is, the dog would bark up the tree, especially if it had been driven to distraction by the antics of the fleeing monkey. This seems plausible. But which tree does Desmond bark up? According to basic probability theory, the likelihood is that he's going to bark up the wrong one. You can work through the permutations in your head if you like. One of the reasons I limited the line of trees to forests so that you could do so without becoming numbered dazed. add just one tree to the row for example, a cedar and the chances of does Desmond barking up the wrong one grow ever greater. If it Desmond barks at each tree in turn, for a period of say, a minute or so the foot of each one, he will sooner or later, to your untold relief and mine bark at the right one. That is unless we throw in an added complication. The monkey being a monkey might well be agile enough to leap from tree top to tree top, from large to pine to Sycamore to which Elm and back again so that at no point is desmond barking up the right tree. In these circumstances, we could have without fear of contradiction that Desmond is barking up the wrong tree. Conversely, though, the monkey of his original pursuit may avoid the dogs barking, there may be loitering in each of the trees, other creatures, such as squirrels have close or even equal interest to a panting barking desperate, massive. So you see, even in the simplest concrete example, drawn from abstract propositions, things become hopelessly hopelessly entangled towards everlasting, the wide wide world

a BBC program called the big questions, which is on every week, sort of studio panel discussion, no studio discussion, with invited guests and people invited, dragged in off the street, talking about the big issues of the day. And I can't quite remember what the subject was, but I saw part of it the other week, and there was someone there was a vicar in the audience, who at one point said that the government ought to be responsible for origami. I see. Anyway, I assume this woman with a vicar she was dressed like a vicar with a vicar's dog collar, but it was probably But she was an imposter Vicar, deliberately or inadvertently. My father, in the 1960s was occasionally mistaken for a man of the cloth due to his in judicious choice of shirt wear. But he wasn't a vicar, but I think this woman more she had a sort of Anglican air about her. And she, she reached Anyway, she recited this list of things that the government should be responsible for, which she kind of shouted. And one of the things on the list was origami, can't remember the other things. It's a moot point whether this is a utopian or dystopian vision. Perhaps she was harking back to Gordon Brown's ill fated government of all the talents, you remember the goats. And she took it to literally. I mean, if a government was to contain all the talents, logically, one such talent would be the ability to Fold paper in intricate oriental fashion. Thus, there ought to be a ministry of origami. Excuse me. They're also the Ministry of origami and associated paper folding, with a secretary of state, supported by Junior ministers and private secretaries and an army of civil servants. Five Year plans for the development of origami on our shores would smack too much of Stalinism. But such bonkers nurses camouflage nowadays by different jargon. Plans to roll out the origami stakeholder consultancy initiative on a region by region basis. amounts are much the same thing as uncle Joe's mad cap schemes, but sound a little less megalomaniac. But would origami become compulsory, what each citizen have to set aside say half an hour per day to fold a sheet of a4 into the shape of an ostrich. Surely that's not what the vicar had in mind. Think of the sheer increase in the amount of waste paper as the more cack handed among the citizenry faff about using up sheet after sheet of a4 in abortive and misshapen attempt to make a halfway decent, or at least recognizable origami ostrich. On the other hand, if origami was to remain as it is now voluntary, what on earth would be the government's role? I mean, we're already cajoled through advertisements and leaflets and publicity campaigns to make sure we eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. But as far as I'm aware, there's not a dedicated band of fruit and vegetable police who will place us under arrest if we fail to comply. So maybe the secretary of state at the Ministry of origami and associated paper folding would content him or herself with mere hectoring and lecturing, poster campaigns, television adverts, mass mailings and the like. Indeed, one advantage of having a leaflet about origami plot through your letterbox would be that the leaflet itself could be folded, intricately oriented into the shape of a sparrow.

Frank Key  13:34
But I don't know. The problem with each initiatives is that a change in government can lead not just to different priorities, but to complete you turns. Imagine that you've been persuaded through relentless hurrying to eat your five fruits and vegetables every day, while setting aside half an hour to do some intricate oriental paper folding. All is well with the world you've slotted happily into your routine. Then inevitably, there's a general election, a new government takes the reins of power, and the new Secretary of State for origami and associated paper folding strides into the ministry on their first morning, bright eyed, dedicated and power crazed. The new board might decide that instead of encouraging origami among the hoi polloi, it's the sort of activity that needs to be controlled and restricted and licensed. It is time for training. The minister announces our week into the job. We have seen this country become the laughingstock of the origami and paper folding world as our hapless cack handed. scrunched up excuses for paper squirrels and ducks and electricity pylons bear no resemblance whatsoever to the fantastically intricate oriental paper squirrels and ducks and electricity pilots. of our competitors, and even less resemblance to flesh and blood squirrels and ducks and electricity pylons in the real world. And so the minister outlaws amateur origami of all kinds, and establishes a new national origami and paper folding baccalaureate, without which no one is even allowed to fold a sheet of paper in half for any purpose whatsoever on pain of arrest and a long term of imprisonment. Whether that's a good thing or not, I leave the listener to decide. It's certainly the kind of issue to sharply divided opinion. Just as 30 years ago, there appeared a book entitled, author's take sides on the Falklands, one can imagine the BM pen song intellectuals of Hampstead and Holland Park, cobbling together a hastily published, authors take sides on origami, whichever side one is on, it's surely the case that many if not most of those who would purchase such a book would immediately rip each page out of it and fold the separate leaves either intricately and Oriental Lee, or with cat candy butter fingers into paper models of the Secretary of State, adding buttons for eyes. Whether they could display the resulting origami on their window sills, or have to hide it in an unlicensed folded paper den would depend upon the complexion of the government. It's very bewildering.

They say the devil is in the detail, but it's a fact. I decided to find out. First of all, I wanted to have a better idea of the detail. I was pretty sure I would know the devil when I saw him. But somehow paradoxically, perhaps the detail seemed a more nebulous entity. So I turned as I always do to the Oxford English Dictionary, which for its main definition has this to say detail, the dealing with matters item by item details, treatment, attention to particulars, especially in the phrase in the detail item by item part by part, minute circumstances circumstantially. So, to go into detail, that is to deal with or treat a thing in its individual particulars. Fair enough, that gave me somewhere to start. If the detail is a minute, individual particular item of a thing. What better way to test the thesis than by taking something apart bit by bit, until the devil in all his evil burning foulness is found lurking within or not as the case may be? The next step was to choose something to dismantle. Now, it must be said that I'm not the most dexterous of traps. On the contrary, I'm a bit of a butter fingers dangling on string from the ceiling of my boyhood bedroom. Well, many many ethics model airplanes, Spitfires and stickers and Messerschmitt and Sopwith camels and Boeing seven, four sevens and Parker, double teenies and Harrier jump jets and so on. All expertly fitted and glued together, and their insignia transfers impeccably transferred. But all these were constructed by my older brother, with whom I shared a room until I was about 10 or 11. I think I tried at least once to emulate him, but the resulting plastic plane did not turn out well. As I recall, the only successful model I made was a cardboard head of Henry the Eighth carton folded from a template printed on the back of a Kellogg's cornflakes carton. It occurred to me that I could just smash something too bit. For generally speaking, violence smashing requires not dexterity but gung ho and a big hammer. Attempting though this was however, I felt it would be going against the spirit of the project. I'm not sure that fragments and smithereens counters details according to that dictionary definition. No, I must be methodical and pick something apart, piece by piece, neatly aligning the individual parts on a suitable surface, such as a base cloth, laid out and flattened smooth upon a tabletop. Green Bay's would make the most suitable background to contrast with the gaudy Scarlet hue of the devil. Were he indeed, to be hiding in the detail? After much reflection, I had a brainwave. I was sitting there staring glumly out of the window at some crows humming and hawing whether to dismantle an alarm clock or a bicycle pump or an Orrery. When it struck me that of course, the simplest thing to take to bid would be something that was Child's Play to put together in the first place. Child's Play, literally, I scampered off to a toy shop and bought a Mr. Potato Head. For those of you who have put away childish things, first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians 1311 and put childish things away so decisively that you can no longer remember who or what Mr. potatohead is lettering, let me remind you, Mr. Potato Head is an American toy, consisting of a plastic model of a potato, which can be decorated with a variety of plastic parts that can attach to the main body. These parts usually include his eyes, shoes, a hat, a nose and a mouth. The toy was invented and developed by George Lerner in 1949, and first manufactured and distributed by Hasbro in 1952.

Frank Key  22:08
The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts that could be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable, such as a parsnip, or turnip, or even a fruit such as a Clementine or a cow's bad plum. Before leaving the toy shop with my purchase, I checked to see that the model was sold in its constructed state, rather than as a jumble of bits. It would be pointless for me to have to put it together before dismantling it. And in any case, if the devil is in the detail, then he would likely be visibly evident within the Mr. Potato Head packaging box, his goatee horns and perhaps his pointy fork, poking holes in the cardboard or cellophane. Back home I took Mr. Potato Head out of his box and set him on the green baize cloth upon the table top. Was that a whiff of sulfur I smelled. It might have been perhaps the devil sensed I was closing in on him and was giving off hellish vapors in his panic. There again. With the devil panic being discovered in the detail. He might rather be gleeful at being unleashed. I hadn't thought of that. I sniffed again, and took a very careful look at Mr. Potato Head, seemingly so innocent upon the bass. Was I about to take an awful irrevocable risk was I about to unleash Satan from his bondage. I gazed into the eyes of Mr. potatohead and asked myself Was I being criminally reckless, playing Terra doodle with the fate of nations just to prove or disprove a familiar saying was there not an easier way? I came to the conclusion that I have not studied demonology with sufficient intensity to answer that question. And that is why I have made an appointment to see father Ninian tongue lash, the Jesuit Exorcist to seek his advice. And that is why Mr. Potato Head is still sitting all his constituent parts connected and dismantled upon the green Bay's flattened upon my tabletop.

Those were three of the essays that I've been appearing daily on the heating yard website since the first of January this year. So far, we're at 54 days of 2012. And there have been 54 essays, including today's one, which was called on jelly. And previous subjects have included the dubbing club, and the magnificence of Peter winguard. Although I didn't actually write that one myself that was a guest post, the only the only essay that I didn't write myself but pretty good going so far as the plan is to do 366 that being a leap year. I'm not sure I'll get that far, but I will try. Anyway, the next the next in the sequence, which you'll hear next week on the show, is on speed and speed there refers to the 1994 film starring Keanu Reeves, and Sandra Bullock, and Dennis Hopper. And so there's something for you to look forward to next week. This week, I just like to end with, well, not so much a quotation as a list. And it's a list written by they don't even list it. Anyway, enough of this babbling Thomas Nash, the Elizabethan pamphleteer who is a great favorite of mine. One of the one of the pamphlets Thomas Nash, published in his lifetime, was the splendidly titled have with you to saffron Walden, which I think is one of the best pamphlet titles I've ever heard, anyway, and Nash, who died at the age of 3332, or 33, had a lifelong sort of vendetta with Gabriel Harvey, who was a pompous fool. And in fact, it's Gabriel Harvey who is admonished to get get weed eater, Saffron Walden because that's where Harvey came from. But in another pamphlet from 1593 called strange news of the intercepting certain letters, and a convoy of verses as they were going privily to victory over low countries. Nash devised a series of nicknames for Gabriel Harvey, and I'd like to read you that list of seven or eight. nicknames now. gafa Yaba no Gamaliel hobgoblin Gilgal is hombre de hoy, Gregory habba. Dean, Gabriel Hank. Hello, Timothy tip toes, braggadocio. glorioso, and my favorite in practice in a pistol pragmas. So, yes, this is in practice of a pistol pragmas signing off from hooting yard for another week. I hope you've enjoyed the show. And I'll be back next week with them to tell you about speed, among other things. Bye bye
