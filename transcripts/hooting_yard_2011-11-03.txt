Good evening This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. And there's just been the advert for the show two weeks tomorrow. So I don't need to repeat all that because you will have listened to it. And it's borrowed into burned into your brain, and you'll be getting your ticket and turning up. No doubt. Now then now even though it's unseemly to rejoice at someone's death, I must admit that I've been with glee when I heard the news that said Jimmy Savile had shuffled off this mortal coil for shuffling off alongside him with the various legal and contractual entanglements, which have prevented me from launching one of my pet project. For years, the light syndrome he threatened to break my arms or worse, if ever I tried to bring my exciting and original conception into being. Now all obstacles and impediments swept aside in a twinkling. I'm able at last to announce that soon soon, the world will gasp but Frankel fix it. I've already bought a wardrobes worth of garish tracksuit much chunky jewelry, and several thousand cigars. I've dyed my hair platinum. Yesterday I went on a sponsored run herring across the field and raising dozens of pens for charity. I am ready to fix it. But what you ask will I fix? Well, Justice said Jimmy Savile made dreams come true for the nation's tinies I shall make dreams come true for the no less important group of the nation's hooting yard readers and listeners. Well do I know that so many of you lie awake at night, tossing and turning, chewing your pillows hoping against hope that one day you will make a personal appearance in our hooting yard story. And by the way, don't think that I've confused the process of dreaming when you're asleep with tossing and turning and chewing your pillow when you are sleepless the beauty of Frankel fix it is that it will make the wishes and desires of both states of dreamy sleep and anguish sleeplessness come true. Could Jimmy have made the same claim even in his pump? I. So how does it work? Well, all you need to do is to send me a letter along the lines of this illustrative example. Dear Frank, please fix it for me to appear in one of your stories where justice I'm about to topple into the bottomless Vita pit of God. I'm rescued by the heroic tot tiny Enid Yours sincerely. And then add your full name. I will then write a story in which you are named over and over again and in which you are about to topple into the bottomless Viper pit of Gar when you are rescued by the plucky fascist tot tiny Enid hand typed on standard unrolled a4 paper. The resulting story will be something for you to treasure and to pass on to your children and your children's children. Yay. And to every generation. Just 1000 pounds a pop. What better way to retrieve fictional hooting yard immortality

half the price I think with your letter, your form letter describing the story you'd like to be in. Don't forget to add the check for 1000 pounds. Anyway on the subject of the bottomless Viper pit of God. It was on this day 200 years ago, was born Cornelius Crake, the man who proved conclusively that the bottomless Viper pit of God was indeed bottom Less Well, perhaps not conclusively for arguments continue to rage on the fringes of what I suppose we can call the bottomless Vita pit community. There remains a handful of doubting Thomases wild eyed loons for the most part, and I use the word balloons advisedly, for at their meetings, they all make noises, not unlike balloons, those birds have the order GAVI forms, sometimes confused with cormorants by people less expert in ornithology than myself. I can state with quiet and rather compelling confidence that I have never mistaken a loon for a cormorant nor cormoran for a Loon. And I will pursue through the courts, anybody who claims I have, so be very, very careful. Gosh, I really must learn to avoid mentioning birds so early in a piece which is meant to be addressing another subject entirely. Such as my enthusiasm for our avian friends, that I get quite carried away and Babylon recklessly. So spirited that I actually forget the existence of full stops just breathlessly adding phrase after phrase connected by commas about loons and cormorants, and all sorts of other birds, Robbins and ducks and even ostriches, until I've completely lost track of what I intended to write about when first I say fingertip to tippy tapper. And I'm lead or I suppose in truth, I should say I lead myself down unintended bird haunted piles, for example, by saying I lose track. The word track makes me think of a rail. And of course a rail. Apart from being a track, such as a locomotive might Thunder along is also a type of bird, an entire family of birds. In fact, the Rayleigh die, including the coot and the gallinule and the Craig Ah, Craig. Craig. as often happens when one is mingling down the byways of Ornithology. One is led inexorably back to where one started, in this case, with Cornelius Craig, whose 200th birthday we celebrate today. He it was who, as I have mentioned, proved conclusively or almost conclusively, we're it not for a curiously persistent band of wild eyed loons, the bottomless pneus of the bottomless Viper pit of God. I can't treat Parson who devoted his time equally between the spiritual welfare of his peasant flock and the intense study of pit. Cornelius Craig first came to public attention with his pamphlet on the bottomless Vita pit of shrubbery net, written in Latin, with footnotes in dog Latin, and an index in Pig Latin. It was a little read, but the front cover caused the sensation. It featured a mezzotint by the 19th century mezzotint rxlist tinters, depicting literally millions of vipers writhing in a bottomless pit. I tried to count each and every Viper in this sensational mezzotint wrote Wilkie Collins, but there were simply too many of them, and the pet itself was bottomless. Incidentally, did you know that there is no such bird as a Wilkie this in spite of the fact that it would make a very suitable name for a bird as can be proved by pretending it is and trying it out on the tongue.

Frank Key  08:58
For example, when out roaming the hills staring at the sky, if one sees a flock of birds appear, swooping, swooping, one can point and cry, Oh look, a flock of Willow keys. Or similarly, if one sees on one's lawn if one has a lawn, a bird pulling from the earth and earthworm for its sapper, one might remark to one's companion. There My darling is nature red in tooth and claw, an earthworm being eaten by a Wilkie. To my mind, both these examples sound convincing to the ear. Wilkie sounds as if it could be a bird. Collins does not. One might in fact work one's way through a list of 19th century novelist judging which ones would make possible bird names for newly discovered birds perhaps or in a new artificial language like Esperanto or Glocer, or August? That will be a happy project for my twilight years when they crash upon me. But there I go, again, prey to the blandishments of birds. Unless I'm careful, I will stop prating about parakeets and vultures, and that will not get us anywhere. Well, it will no doubt extend your knowledge of the parakeet and the vulture, of which you may think you know something, until I bestow upon you the full Titanic weight of my own parakeet and vulture learning, when you will realize have fathomless is your own ignorance. fathomless, bottomless the bottomless pit of God. That is my proper subject today, not birds. Anyway, buried in one of the dog Latin footnotes in his pamphlet on the bottomless Viper pit of shrubbery ness, Cornelius Craig made mention of what at that time was known merely as the Viper pit of Gar, it bottomless sness being not only unproven but unsuspected. There had been conjecture among Viper wrists and pit observers, but of a desultory kind stray remarks between mouthfuls of sausages, picnics, and that sort of thing. 19th century Viper tourists were forever charging or for picnics, usually choosing sites close to Viper pit. Craig being a pet enthusiast, rather than a viper wrist, did not receive invitations to such picnics, and his fellow pit aficionados tended not to picnic at all, preferring to rent rooms in banqueting houses and the like. This all changed in the late Victorian era, of course, but we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. It so happened, however, one stormy March day that the country passed and stumbled upon a viper forest picnic quite by chance, while sallying across a more famished he was offered a sausage and a beaker of invigorating tonic, a shy pass and he did not at once join in the conversation of the Viper wrists, but squatted to one side of their picnic blanket, eyes glued to the sky. There are no pets in the sky. But there are puppets, sometimes a bird which always fascinated Crake, probably because pipit and pit are so close in the sound. It may even be that short sighted as he was, he had once misread a reference to a puppet as being a reference to a pit, and that happy accident had led him along a mental path he had never intended to follow. I am restraining a powerful temptation to tell you everything I know about puppet. As he was munching his last mouthful of sausage and preparing to flit away from the picnic, one of the Vipers made a controversial remark about the bottomless Viper pit of shrubbery ness, Cornelius Craig was impelled to utter both a rejoinder and a corrective. These raised the collective eyebrows of the Viper wrists until the past and revealed himself as the author of the stupendous pamphlet, at which point he was garlanded with praise, given a second sausage had his beaker refilled, and was coaxed onto the picnic blanket.

And it was at this very picnic that he was persuaded to undertake his study of the bottomless Viper pit of Gar, challenged to ascertain once and for all, as best the science of the time allowed, whether it was bottomless or not. With much needed funding from wealthy and well connected Viper wrists. Cornelius Craig devised and constructed a probe involving vacuum funnels and nozzles and steam power and Coddington lenses. He had this transported to God by train, following in its wake astride his humble horse Keith, before the year without, he was able to write up his results in Latin and have them translated and published in one of the leading Viper risk journals. On a stormy March day, precisely one year after the historic picnic, the Viper pit of God was officially renamed the bottomless Viper pit of God as a special pit side ceremony. The mayor, the beetle, the Grand Vizier The honest burgers and a gaggle of peasant folk gathered for speeches, the cutting of ribbons, the flying of banners, the relentless pounding of drums, the popping of two colors and chanting, chanting, chanting, and others celebrate or what have you, including the tossing into the bottomless Viper pit of several vipers, and a picnic with sausages and beakers of invigorating tonic. Cornelius Crake, the shy and modest country Parson was in attendance, but went unrecognized, for he had grown a massive beard and wore a weird hat and would talk of nothing but pipits. I will tell you everything you could possibly want to know. And more on the subject of pipits another time.

That piece appeared on the hooting yard website yesterday. And I suppose on a lot of blogs, people use tags you know, that could have been tagged with Viper pit Crake, birds similarly, but for some reason, quite possibly ignorance. I've never made it my practice to add tags to hooting your posts the address, I shoved them into a category that appeared as pros, but I've always neglected the tags. And it's not something I've often thought about until the other day when I've realized that a skilled tagger can create something approaching poetry. There's a friend of mine who I thumped on the bonds with the hammer of thump Enos until she caved in and began blogging. And she began a blog called Blackberry, Juniper and sherbert for some reason, and I have to say that very quickly, she showed an incredible grasp of tagging. Consider this, this was one of the very early posts and the tags were memory, rain. Swanage wind what a Corker memory rain Swanage wind, it's time surely to reject Carol Ann Duffy from the poet laureate ship, and appoint my friend in her stead.

It's a curious fact that whenever I think of the characters who stalked the dreams and nightmares of my childhood starlin liveaction. Paavo Nurmi, the one who looms largest and most vividly is the one who never actually existed outside my infinite imagination. The breadcrumbs man was tall and gangly and pale, and breadcrumbs was scattered in his hair and in his beard, and upon his coat, and the pockets of his coat. they too were crammed with breadcrumbs, and he left a trail of breadcrumbs in his wake. As he patrolled the streets and alleyways and bridges of the ancient city were in my dreams and nightmares I grew to manhood. He followed me wherever I roamed through the ancient streets and alleyways and across the ancient crumbling bridges over the river. Sometimes the river sparkled in sunlight. But when I climbed down the steps to the mud banks, I saw it was filthy and rife with toxic sludge, and tiny wriggling worms. The breadcrumbs man followed me down the steps to the mud banks too, and scattered his breadcrumbs upon the waters, where they floated, neglected by the worms, and by any other living things that might present themselves in my sleeping brain from time to time. They will never remember any birds.

Frank Key  20:03
Always he remained behind me, the breadcrumbs man, and if I turn to speak with him, he stood Stockstill and averted his gaze, shunning me. So the words caught in my throat. But what would I have said, with Stalin, and lev Yashin and Parvo Normally, I would have long and animated discussions about communism and football and long distance running. But I've got them mixed up. So I will talk to Starling about football to lead the action about long distance running, and Parvo. nerney, the only non communist of the trio about communism. Sometimes when I woke, I would record these conversations in great detail and write accounts of them in my jotter, complete with stage directions. I remember thinking that one day in years to come, I could mold these dialogues into a dramatic presentation, and take the theatres of the land by storm. And years later, when I had grown to manhood, I came upon the Johto one day in a chest stuffed with memorabilia, and I read a few pages, and I shook my head and guffawed for it was all nonsense, and witless nonsense at that. Yet the breadcrumbs man who never spoke, and to whom I could never utter a word, the breadcrumbs man haunts me to this day. He no longer appears in my dreams and nightmares and has not done so since asked since one summer afternoon in my early teens, I was at a picnic in a Brighton Buttercup splattered field, and replete with sandwiches and sausages and pastries and pickles. I fell into Windows. I found myself striding purposefully across the most crumbling and ancient of the crumbling and ancient bridges across the river. I sensed that the breadcrumbs man was following me and turned my head momentarily to confirm that it was so I quickened by pace. He did likewise. Then we were at the docks. I had never visited them before. They were huge tankers and container ships, some with the hammer and sickle emblem daubed on their side. And there were smaller boats, fishing smacks and tugs and rowing boats. And for the first time, there were birds, girls, screeched, guillemots, tumbled and swooped orcs and skewers rule soared. I looked behind me, there was the breadcrumbs man, somehow paler than ever, almost a ghost. And again for the first time, he looked directly at me. His eyes were milky, and blind and terrible. Suddenly, he emptied his pockets of breadcrumbs and shook the breadcrumbs from his hair and his beard. The gulls and guillemots and orcs and skewers, descended in a frenzy of scavenge and peck a blur of birds in which the breadcrumbs man was engulfed. And when the birds flew away, he had vanished. I never saw him again. In the bright field on that summer's day, I woke, I cracked open a can of squirrels show and slurped it down. My mother was packing things away in the picnic basket. I'm going to be an ornithologist, I declared. I am not an ornithologist,

seemingly much about birds and picnics this week, not sure what that's about. I have two days worth of hooting yard pros. If I was tagging, like my friend, it would be birds and picnics, obviously. And recently, I read an interesting book from 1974 called Victorian people and ideas by Richard de altec, who far as I know, was one of the great scholars of the Victorian era, despite being an American professor of literature, and, and there's many good things in the book, but I thought I'd I thought you might enjoy this quotation. The evangelicals fast humanitarian concerns prompted them to found literally hundreds of philanthropic and missionary organizations, some with dense networks of local branches and committees reaching across the country. The diversity of these causes, as well as their individual limitations may be inferred from this small selection of late 18th and early 19th century societies, some of whose titles are as long as their constitutions. The ladies Association for the benefit of gentle women of good family reduced in fortune below the state of comfort to which they have been accustomed. The friendly Female Society for the relief of poor infirm aged widows, and single women of good character who have seen better days. The Guardian society for the preservation of public morals by providing temporary asylums for prostitutes. The London orphan asylum for the reception and education of destitute orphans, particularly those descended from respectable parents. The National Trust society for the relief of the ruptured poor, the Society for returning young women to their friends in the country, and the Royal humane society to restore persons in a state of suspended animation. Seemingly, the evangelicals have a society to cover every contingency.

Frank Key  27:24
The beginning of this week show we mentioned the death of some Jimmy Savile, and it wouldn't have surprised me how he been around in the 19th century. I think he may well have done some sponsored runs for the National Trust society for the relief of the rock could pour, possibly also for the Society for returning young women to their friends in the country. I must say I personally would be quite interested in the Royal Humane Society, for restoring persons in a state of suspended animation. I think I may have to reform reform that that society and see what we can do. Anyway, that's the end of the show for this week. Don't forget to come to the live hooting yard experience and an evening of lopsided prose and lagu breus music where I'll be accompanied by out of Spaceman. That's two weeks tomorrow on Friday the 18th of November at Wolfson into a bookshop in Bermondsey square, London, S e one, go to the Wolfson and type website, there's two O's in wolf. No worries three hours in Wilson, w, w, OLFSN and Tay one word, go to their website or follow a link to it from the hooting yard website. book your tickets, and you can listen to me babbling all evening, except I'll be interrupted by outerspace man singing songs, which will probably come with something of a relief. And yeah, yeah, go to the website to hooting yard.org send me any spare cash you have lying around. It always helps. poverty stricken scribblers can always do with a bit of spare cash and buy some books or anything else that you want to do. So yeah. Okay, that's it for this week. I'll be back next week, possibly with more about birds, and possibly even more about picnics.
