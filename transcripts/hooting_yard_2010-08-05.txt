Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And longtime listeners will know that the theme music you've just heard is the Caucasian lullaby by slap happy and Henry cow from 1975. Someone commented on the hooting yard blog at www dot hooting yd.org that they assumed that was the theme music was the choice of theme music was an act of hostility towards my audience. Make of that what you will? Maybe it was I was striding manfully across sawdust bridge on my way to see a man about some snails. When I was accosted and harangued by a gobby get his speech, if one can call it that was in decorous and unseemly, and His head was somewhat larger than the usual head. I wonder if in his infancy, his fontanelle had sealed properly, or if it remained a jar as it were allowing a surfeit of oxygen into his cranium. Were that the case? It might just might account for his loud haranguing for loud, it was drawing the attention of other citizens passing along the bridge, each of whom gazed at him and me, before hurrying along, bent upon whatever errands they were bent upon that morning. I found it very difficult to judge whether his torso was closed in a pullover, or a cardigan, the garment seems to resist definition. It was certainly not a sweater, nor a jumper, nor could it be called a top, but I could not pinpoint exactly what it was. Such was the nature of his harangue, that it was impossible to interrupt him, so I had no opportunity to question him on the matter. The presence of buttons argued for cardigan, yet it was not quite a cardigan, having a definite something of the pullover about it. It began to rain. atop the the, excuse me, a top of the gets unusually large head purchased a yellow oil cloth sour Westar, suggesting to me that he was not neglectful of meteorological conditions. Given the size of his head, the southwestern, which would have served as adequate cover for most heads looked comically tiny. It occurred to me that he might wear it in rain or shine, as protection phase unsealed fontanelle and that it's keeping the rainfall off the top of his head was secondary, a sort of bonus. Meanwhile, with a certain breo I unfold my brolly. I held this aloft, as if I were Liberty brandishing her flambeau though necessarily at an angle better poised to borrow raindrops from falling on my head. And just as my brolly barred the raindrops, so the gobhi get barred my progress further along sawdust bridge towards my appointment with the snails chap. As he delivered his loud and unseemly stream of invective. He constantly shifted his position so that he was always standing directly in front of me as I fainted this way, and that in my attempts to go where I wanted to go, I ought to have lashed out at him with my brolly. But long, long ago, I made a vow. Well, if I'm honest, I was forced to make a vow on pain of eternal punishment in the hereafter. And with the added spur of the threat of having my fontanelle pierced and punctured in the here and now. The important thing for present purposes was that the vow had been made and that I had held to it.

raindrops were falling at a slight angle upon the buttons of the Gabi get cardigan or pull over and then dripping his feet, which I noted was shorting the sock and sandal combination associated with a certain stereotype. He did not seem at all that type to me there on sawdust bridge in the morning rain, delivering his loud harangue and accompanying it now with wild gesticulations. I did not feel menaced by these gesticulations for at no point did his arms move towards my head or my body. They were rather like the movements of the sales of a windmill or of a swimming person doing the butterfly stroke. seemed curiously disconnected from his harangue, neither emphasizing points within his indecorous guttural balling, if indeed there were any, nor accompanying it in any way. Also, he was wearing mittens. There was a spattering of yellow stains upon the mittens and identical shade to the patches of yellow on his moustache, which was of the walrus variety. I jumped to the conclusion that it was either mustard or custard. Perhaps from the eating of a hot dog or a custard tart. I was unable to discern any crumbs, the composition of which of bread or pastry would have confirmed which of my suspicions was the correct one. Although of course, it was possible that the stains were neither mustard nor custard, but another yellow substance entirely. Again, so unstoppable was the Gabi get harangue, that I was unable to question him on the point. When long ago I made or was forced to make my vow. I was vouchsafed a few tips about what I could do in circumstances where I might wish to lash out with my brolly instead of lashing out with my brolly. But with similar effect, one is rarely vouchsafed anything at all nowadays, but as I said, it was long long ago. As I peered at the Gabi gets rather go cheese cloth trousers are where they pantaloons, one of the tips bubbled up from the sea of memory, and bobbed to the surface. Tilt your head heavenward. I recalled being told and call out lustily and high in pitch for all the angels in heaven to be collaborate together and send down to you a deus ex machina. Now, I have never knowingly seen an angel and instinctively I feel such a creature cannot really exist. But the Gabi get was getting on my WIC By this time, and so I followed the old advice I had been vouchsafed. Of course, when I tilted my head heavenward. All I saw was the dry underside of my brolly. So I shifted it to one side again, with I hope no little breo and the raindrops immediately splashed upon my face. I sang out imploring the aid of quite probably fictional unearthly winged beings. And do you know, all at once, there was a mighty gust of wind across the bridge, and the Southwest or top of the Gobi gets head was blown clear away. It skimmed and swooped across the sky, like a bright yellow bird, and a raindrop, perhaps more than one raindrops, plural, fell directly through his unsealed fontanelle and landed Splish Splash upon his exposed brain, and he crumpled to the ground. And oh, last last he ceased haranguing me, for He neither spoke now, nor croaked. He was silent. I left him where he lay sprawled upon the paving slabs, whether dead or alive, I did not know and I hurried on wood to meet my appointment with the snails man. We transacted useful business repair to a canteen for luncheon parted with a handshake in the shade of a gigantic shrub in the Botanical Gardens. And I made my way home crossing sawdust bridge, I saw no sign of the gobby get who had harangue me. And I learned later listening to a local news bulletin on the wireless that he had died upon the bridge that morning of water on the brain. I attended his funeral later that week and placed a bunch of dandelions in the grave side mud. It was still raining.

In a bold move, the colossally arrogant film director Horst gak, has bought the right to the much loved cartoon character, unconscious squirrel, the unconscious squirrel, and he's planning to feature it in his forthcoming adaptation of Sylvia Plath poem, the moon and the yew tree. The film with a working title of unconscious squirrel, the unconscious squirrel in Sylvia Plath, the moon and the yew tree, To be shot entirely in class Oh gape of vision, an exciting new cinema technology developed by Horst ghacks mysterious wife and collaborator actrix Primrose dent. According to press releases, plateau gape vision will utterly transformed the viewing experience rendering everything from action thrillers to comedies to submarine heist genre movies into a uniform, blackness, blackness and silence. Professor dimity cashu an academic in the department of plant ology at the University of ACC, has been quick to point out that there are no squirrels conscious or unconscious in the poem, only small bats and owls and is fretful that Horst ghacks screenplay will trivialize class work. In an open letter to the director posted on her blog, she asks, How are you going to insert a cartoon squirrel into your ill advised film treatment without doing violence to the legacy of st Sylvia Horst gak, being Horst gak replied within 30 seconds in a comment or diatribe, longer than Dr. cashews original blog postage, buried within lengthy paragraphs of invective Was this the squirrel is engulfed by PLAs fumie Spiritist mist and lies unconscious for the duration of the film, six and three quarter hours, partly hidden by the role of headstones. I have been able to acquire the very same headstones that we used in the graveyard scenes of plan nine from outer space starring Bela Lugosi and his posthumous standing, though I need hardly point out that the production values and aesthetic cloud of my film will far surpass Edwards cult classic. A war of words is now broken out across the blogosphere. No doubt Horst gak will win the day, for we must remember that he has Primrose dent at his side, and if sufficiently provoked, she will simply turn off the entire internet actually has threatened to do before her impeccably manicured fingers poised over the big black button on her Uber console. unconscious squirrel, the unconscious squirrel in Sylvia Plath, the moon and the yew tree is due for release at some point after the expiry of the ancient Mayan calendar in 2012.

If you're the kind of person who wanders around the blogosphere before Primrose den turns off the internet, don't forget to go to hooting yard.org, the finest website ever weather, billions of words to read and books to buy donations to give all sorts of things. If you're listening to the podcast, you may wish to thank me for reading to you for half an hour by sending me a pittance via PayPal or even more than a pittance. But onwards now. The night was a little less than perfect, and his horse did not have a metabolism. That's the preamble to a story called a night there was by Robert F. Yang, which was published in analog science fact and fiction in July 1963. And this fragment from a pulp magazine was almost certainly the inspiration for Dobson's important pamphlet, published as it happened on the day of the Kennedy assassination in Dallas, entitled somewhat in elegantly in elegantly. A comparative study of the metabolisms of the horses have three nights of the realm out of print. Dobson begins with a bold declaration. In this pamphlet, I'm going to prove beyond all reasonable doubt and Brooking not one whit of opposition that the horse of salons a lot of the Arthurian round table had the metabolism of a squirrel that the horse of his confrere Sir bedivere had the metabolism of a gnat and the whole have soaked clouds with a shovel of later date have a metabolism so extraordinary and anomalous that science has yet to account for it. By findings, which will completely overturn the accepted wisdom regarding the metabolism of horses written by Knights of the realm are backed up by a wealth of evidence, only I have had the energy and diligence to Winkle out of the documentary record, and this evidence in the form of a vast scholarly apparatus of footnotes and citations and what have you will be published in a separate series of pamphlets in due course.

Frank Key  15:45
It never was. So the reader has to take on trust 40 pages of wild assertion, idiotic Wittering at quiet ignorance, and frankly, incomprehensible gibberish, all of it written as we would expect in majestic sweeping dogs sonian paragraphs. The pamphlet is remembered today chiefly for the much anthologized passage about nose bags crammed with hay, which, though factually inaccurate, has served as a model for many a novice pamphleteer. I well remember the way these words have Dobson's transfixed me in my early faltering stabs at composition, and half the years I was unable to write a finished piece without inserting something about hay in those bags, no matter what miles sensible subject. It has to be said that editors were kind to me, the inevitable rejection letters are received, gently pointed out that I could easily delete the hay in those bags stuff without fatally undermining my prose. But I was young and headstrong, and I wouldn't countenance the change even have a comma to what I'd scribbled so decisively with my propelling pencil on my tablet of note paper. In those days, I cared not to pound the keys of a typewriter like Mancunian polymath Anthony Burgess, my hero Dobson was a Scribbler. And so would I be the truth of it was, of course that without acknowledging the fact I was being smothered under the Dobson cushion, as so many beginners have been my salvation and the prompt that allowed me at long last to cast the cushion aside, was a commission from a now defunct magazine, beasts of barnyard and field to pen an article about nose bags crammed with high. I worried and fretted at it so much, that in nervously knowing my propelling pencil, I managed to get a sliver of LED stuck in my craw and had to be in clinic. It was the morning of my 51st day there. When sprawled on my balcony, gazing at the mountains. I sensed a tiny yet dramatic shifting of the integuments within my head, and knew at once that I was free of Dobson. The Mighty out of print pamphleteer will always remain my idol. But on that morning in that clinic on that balcony, I knew it was possible for me to plow my own farro. I tore up the few puny pages of prose. I had written about hay in those bags, and instead submitted to the magazine, a piece about swill for pigs. Last later that day, listening to the news on the wireless in the clinics rumpus room, I learned that the skyscraper housing the offices of beast of barnyard and field had collapsed after attack by woodworm and weevils and tiny, tiny beings that bore through cement. And the magazine had ceased publication. I thought, I'm not gonna let that stop me. And it has not.

Frank Key  19:21
I want you, if you can close your eyes and conjure up an image of the ancient world. What do you see? Do you see a fellow in a toga beating a bird about the bonds with an iron bar? No. Then read your Pliny. Here he is Pliny the Elder in the natural history, telling us about parents. She has an heyd as hard as is her beak. When she learns to speak She must be beaten about the head with a rod of iron that otherwise she carries for no blows. And that's in the translation of the natural history by the 17th century, Translator filamin, Holland. and elsewhere in his translation, he uses the phrase Barton and mew for aviary. I think that splendid. And I suggest that we all take every opportunity to resurrect that word. So next time you need to refer to an aviary, please call it a Barton and mew. You might want to make a note of that in your day book, particularly if as plenty or Holland says elsewhere, your memory is so shital you will soon forget the same again.

Frank Key  21:05
Here's another quote from filamin Holland's translation of Pliny the elder's natural history. Now certain nations there be that account beasts yay and some filthy things for God's yay and many other matters more shameful to be spoken, swearing by stinking meats by garlic and such like, but surely to believe that God's have contracted marriage and that in so long continuance of time, no children should be born between them. Also, that summer aged and ever Horry and gray. Others again young and always children, that they'd be black of color and complexion. winged lame hatched of eggs, living and dying each other day, our mere foolery is a little better than childish toys. One person who was very familiar with the ancient idea that an egg might serve as a childish toy, and that from the egg would hatch a God was tiny Enid Excuse me. On the day of her birth, she was presented with an egg by her mysterious unnamed mentor. And as soon as she grew older enough for childish play, it became a favorite toy. It's easy to forget give them the plucky tots, many deeds of heroism and derring do that she was still butter taught, and when time allowed, she played as other tots too. She played games such as hide the egg in the pantry, roll the egg down a gentle incline, and balance the egg on a precipice over a yawning chasm. It's not entirely clear when tiny Enid learned that her egg contained an ad yet unhatched God, it's also perfectly possible that it did not and that the venture some little fascist simply invented the idea for purposes of self traumatization. Either way, we do know that one hot summer's day, she stopped treating the egg as a placing placed it in a carton, put the carton on her mantle piece and spent many long hours watching over it, waiting for it to hatch. Several writers better to call them hacks have devoted vast swathes of psychobabble to the suggestion that tiny Enid was convinced or convinced herself that by embarking on ever greater feats of infant heroism, she could somehow persuade the god to crack open it to egg and burst forth into the world, ushering in a new dispensation under the cope of heaven, and not Incidentally, installing the tot as it Archangel. In this reading, tiny Enid is impelled to act and adventures of ever greater recklessness, for purely selfish reasons. The hacks who peddle this stuff never stopped to consider two blindingly obvious objections. One, it makes no sense whatsoever. And two, there is no evidence that at the end of each of her adventures, tiny Enid dashed back to her mantle piece to check on the egg. On the contrary, she was notorious for sticking around to receive plaudits and medals and cups and

Unknown Speaker  24:35
cash prizes,

Frank Key  24:36
and to watch parades passed by in her honor. And on occasions when these things did not happen, she would bash a few heads together, literally, until she considered do gratitude was displayed. These are not the activities of one who hankers for the imminent intervention of the Divine whether from an egg or from anywhere else indeed a better case could be made that a child is self possessed and drunk on her own reputation as tiny Enid would consider the arrival of a new God as fatally stealing her thunder. It's worth asking what sort of god she was expecting to hatch from the egg on her mantle piece. Although she was not a religious girl, it's a matter of record that she had, like the Swiss skiing Ace woodcarver Steiner, great expertise. During these enhancements, did she have visions of egg hatched God? It's a great pity that she never left us on account of at least one of her great expertise in her memoirs. The egg itself is mentioned over and over again. At first in references to its status as a placing as here on page 47. I passed many a happy hour playing carry the egg towards the pond and other delightful pastimes. And then, from page 88 onwards, she constantly reminded us of its numinous presence. before wrapping up my jalopy to speak to the rescue of the stricken and the main two had been attacked by the giant lobster being I paused to look at the egg and its carbon on the mantle piece. It had not yet hatched, for example, and the next Thursday was a particularly dull day without any opportunity for daring rescues of those imperiled. I spent much of my time contemplating the egg and its carton on the mantel piece from which no God had yet hatched. in her lifetime, no God ever did hatch from the egg. But I suppose it's not impossible, but one might still do so. For though tiny Enid herself eventually grew old and died, she always kept the egg with her wherever she roamed in her long life. And at her death, it was found among her effects carefully catalogued by those who keep her flame alive. The egg in its carton, is now kept in the tiny Enid museum recently established in a cavernous hangar on a so called rustic industrial estate, on the edge of the mythic marshes on the outskirts of pointy town. If you visit and pay through the nose for an entrance ticket, seek out the egg in its refrigerated chamber. And who knows, perhaps while you were there, you will see the shell crack and a god hatch out come blind and trembling into the world.

That's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. I'll be back next week with more morally uplifting prose and the odd quotation and what sort of thing go to the website. Have a nice week.

Unknown Speaker  28:10
Bye bye.
