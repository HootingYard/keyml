Good evening this is indeed hooting yard with me, Frank key. I hope you've got pens and or pencils and paper handy because we're going to begin this week with some extremely useful reference information. There's a hooting yard aficionado named Mike Jennings, and he's very sensibly spent his time, trawling through the entire hooting yard archive on the interweb. That's six years worth of babblings. For me, this is the written stuff on the hooting yard website, not the podcast. And from that troll, he compiled a bibliography of every pamphlet written by Dobson which I have ever mentioned. Or at least I think so. He says in an email, much work has to be done of course with regard to details, such as binding, font, illustration, etc. But I know my limitations, such scrutiny I will leave to more qualified Dobson just with the requisite anoraks and little greaseproof bags of egg sandwiches. And so it's a also describes it as a tentative work in progress. The Bibliography is ordered according to an arcane system of Mr. Jennings own devising one the intrinsic beauty of which I hope we can all appreciate, and I took the liberty of applying a set of blockman numbers to the pamphlet titles. Though broadly similar to ordinary numbers, they of course harbor a terrifying underlying significance. To paraphrase HP Lovecraft, the Most Merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind to understand the botsman numbers. Anyway, here numbered are the are over 100 Dobson pamphlet, unless otherwise stated, and nowhere is it so stated, all titles are out of print. One, the adhesive properties of 600 different types of glue with diagrams to Dobson ethics, three a recantation of Dobson ethics, four on the history of potato clocks. Five, my revolutionary new method of moving sludge around the countryside. Six hedges hidden from sight by steam. Seven I piano tuner. Eight.

Nine why I shall bestride this century like a Colossus 10 certain aspects of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting 11 killer bees fairing push gas and tomatoes on the vine. 12 how I coped with a collapsed lung during a thunderstorm 13 true nor eel teeth papen slops for dinner.

So I hope you found that useful list useful. And you ticked off the ones you'd read, or the ones you're collecting or the ones you want to swap with another reader. This is called two vans. Two vans, we set out to tramp, the widow and the break of dawn, hoping to make vanish before nightfall. I knew little about my traveling companions. I had no idea for example of what the champ was a champion, nor did I know whose relict the widow, the widow was, nor for how long she had been wearing her widow's weeds. They, in their turn, must have known almost nothing about me safe perhaps that I was a fanatical devotee of trebizond. Culpepper, whose glorious image shot forth rays of golden light from the bad guy wore upon my tunic. donkeys we had abducted with great daring in broad daylight from the beach where they were employed to give rides to holidaying urchins. They were sturdy beasts with a surprising elegance in their carriage. I was well aware as where the camp and the widow that laws exists to regulate the number of hours a donkey may be worked, but I spat in the face of the laws, and my companions did too. We were determined to get two vans in a single day. And if In so doing, we were to exhaust our donkeys, then Soviet trebizond Oh, culpepper's recorded pronouncements on donkeys, and nomadic, to say the least. And though I could not claim to have a full understanding of them, I felt sure we were following the right path. By path there, I mean, of course, the way of trebizond though Culpepper, not the path to Vande accustomed as they were to the golden strands of their seaside resort, abducted donkeys would have been utterly discombobulated had we led them along the main arterial trunk roads to vans, with its thundering traffic of container lorries and speed frenzied van borne riffraff. We chose instead, to make our way across fields and green sward, taking the occasional quiet country lane or abandoned railway line where the opportunity arose. We had no map. Instead, we relied on the widows profound and in many ways unnerving knowledge of the lie of the land. In lesson type enlightened times, they would have burned her for a witch. Have the three of us only the tramp had previously been to Vande? One of the early heats in his progress to the championship had been drew to take place at Vandy marshes, and the Tramp was billeted in the village beforehand. In the event, the contest was canceled because of an unprecedented Starling storm, teeming millions of birds swooping over the marshes, and the Tramp and his rivals were driven away in Shera banks to a new location. When he spoke, which was rarely the champs speech was punctuated with chuckles which I found mightily disconcerting. And my own knowledge of vans was based on a roto gravure by the noted roto gravure wrist Rex roto graph, which had been presented to me as a prize for PR Sweden's by trebizond. Oh cold peppers in a circle. I pored over this picture for hours and hours, drinking in every detail, until I felt as if I knew vangie itself. In truth, of course, I knew nothing. Nothing whatsoever, a vantage advantage marshes of anything at all, in essence, in the ungrateful beggar. 1898 lay on boy reports his mother telling him, my dear child, it is true, you're an ox, but an ox whose bellowing will one day astonish Christendom through diligent study of the way of trebizond Oh Cole pepper, I had eventually had drummed into me my own ox like stupidity. I had high hopes that my visit to Vande might inspire my Bella wings, which to date had been few and those few incoherent

when I published an account of an earlier journey by abducted donkey to a village that I mistook for vank it was suggested to me that I also have included through a kind of ventriloquism, the donkeys thoughts and observations. There are narratives that go in for that sort of thing, and no doubt readers who lap it up. But trebizond Oh, kalpetta expressively forbids such misuse of our talents if talents we have and he is surely right to do so. On the present occasion, we had not even learned our donkeys names, and that would have been a necessary precursor to any attempt to burrow into their interior beings. For logistical purposes. Before we even got clear of the beach, the widow had assigned each donkey or nonce name, but her choices were long winded and multi syllabic and did not serve their purpose. I have forgotten what they were. I have forgotten more than that. But what I remember with absolute clarity as if it were yesterday, is how as day became dusk and dusk darkened tonight, the champ the widow and i upon our donkeys guided at the last buyer star burning bright against the black reached the end of our journey. There was Vantage, and they're closest still so close, we could stop and dismount and make the last few yards on foot was Vantage Well, number five. The domed building like a Grecian temple was falling to ruin after years of neglect. Its structure cracked in places across beam detached the render upon the exterior walls in need of replacement. And little remaining of the original lettering, there was still evidence of the other wells close by and hidden in the undergrowth was the concrete hard standing where one stood a large wooden hut that was used for storage. This was the last of five wells sunk following the discovery over a century ago of magic water by self styled farmer Edwin cash was highly sulfated and he bottled it and sold it labeled as farmer cashes famous medicinal Van dewater extolling it great medicinal value in curing such ailments as lumbago stomach troubles, rheumatoid complaints and nervous disorders. But then the sanatorium was built nearby on higher ground, and its drainage system contaminated the magic water and the business collapsed. Just as the structure of the van dwell number five was in a state of collapse. Just as after a day riding our abducted donkeys, the widow, the champ and I were close to collapse. We had strength enough though, working together to sink our siphons into the ground and suck up the magic water. we cared not that it was contaminated. In the night, on the outskirts of vans, we drank our fill, each for our own reasons. The Champ plagued by lumbago. Fearing that next season, he would fail to retain his championship drank the magic water. The widow martyred by stomach troubles and rheumatoid complaints, drank the magic water and me with my nervous disorders and my fanatical devotion to trebizond Oh Cole pepper. I drank the magic Vantage water to I drank deep above us, the bright burning star was extinguished and we were engulfed in darkness. We could no longer see each other nor are abducted donkeys. We could no longer see even the crumbling ruin of vans. Well, number five. We waited for the dawn for a new day. For the Transfiguration wrought upon each of us by the magic water van.

I learned the other day that some people seem to think I make this stuff up. When in fact it's all rigorously researched. factual reportage goes without saying I hope that van dwell number five is as I described it, it's History and Edwin cash the self styled farmer is an existing historical figure. And around 100 years ago you could have bought a bottle of his famous magic Van dewater Altru vans by the way is on the outskirts of basil than in ethics. And two ends this this week, a poem overthe could Cold Blood when and full Jen sack blood when was una merveille years she had an orange head. She played spinette with great L and the day before she wed. She married a man called food Jen sack, one of Liz and Croix eobs his nose was as the beak of a crow, and he soon lost his marbles. Baldwin hired a rowing boat and plied it across the lake. She gathered her herbs and flowers and infusion for to make this will set your brain to rights do drink it for Jen sack, she said when she rewrote the lake as soon as she got back. But there was rotten ergot in her bubbling hot to sane. So when her husband drank it, he went permanently insane blood when he had to train him up in the attic of their Chateau. And Ever After all her days were filled with grief and Whoa. If this story has a moral, it is one I have forgot. Just be very wary of contaminated gold.

And that's all we have time for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you made notes of the various Dobson pamphlets, enjoyed the reportage on the village of Vande Vander marshes by the ways and RSPB reserve preserve and enjoyed this little polymer that the merveilles and the ankle rehab. And I'll be back next week with more stuff to entertain you. And that's it. Bye bye.
