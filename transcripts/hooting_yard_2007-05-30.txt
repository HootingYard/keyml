Afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and it's that time of the week when we go to hooting yard. And I don't know if you remember the last bank holiday, how long ago was it two days ago, and it was extremely wet and wretched. Just like today, really. But this is what I wrote on the on the morning of the bank holiday two days ago. What better way to spend a wet bank holiday afternoon than to curl up in front of the television to watch a trilogy of films by one of the great unsung otres of the silence screen. The cable channel UK golden pap is to be congratulated for screening the Masterworks of the great and greatly misunderstood pastors tack. When tax films are mentioned, which is rarely, they are dismissed as fake twee confections for children in an age when childhood was seen as a time of purity and innocence. Thus, the damning rebuke of a cravat wearing pipe smoking goatee bearded critic like ruin luck both who wrote with these insipid pieces of froth tack not only drains his films of sound and color, but also of plot tension, engagement, disturbance of life and death and sex. What Bob says is true, yet he fails to understand just how radical and approach tak took. Yes, these films are indeed fe and tweet, yet at the same time, they are cloying and saccharin, miraculously, inoffensive, whimsical in the most nauseating sense of the word. The first in the trilogy is Pepe the pony goes to the paddling pool. The part of Pepe was played by taks own pony poopy, a placid, well groomed little darling with gossamer ribbons flowing from its main in silent black and white. We want just Pippi Cantor's towards a paddling pool and splashes about gently and charmingly. There are no fancy camera angles. No clever, clever montage look tacky, saying a pony in a paddling pool. He followed this up with biffi the Africanized killer bee joins a swarm in this possibly the finest of the three films biffi play by tax pet Africanized killer bee Leticia is shown buzzing around a municipal flower bed, then going off to draw in a swarm of her fellows. Tax camera is static, except at the very end, where it pans to show busy journey from solitude to companionship. The last film is the one where tak takes the greatest risk with his creative vision. With schmoopy the vampire bat sucks the life blood from a consumptive often, the task of retaining a quintessentially tak esque tweeners must at times have seemed impossible. But once again, the OTA in tack pulls it off in a magnificently sugar coated fairy cake of a film. schmoopy by the way, was played by taks own vampire bat Flopsy, while the part of the consumptive often went to a doe eyed and consumptive often the director found swooning and crumpled, clutching weekly at the railings of Pang Hill orphanage during a blizzard. If there's a better way to spend 11 hours on a wet bank holiday than watching these films, I for one another loss to think what it might be.

This is a story called pale and fierce. It was pale and fierce, gulping down a bowl of soup. I wonder if it was jar come to deliver me from Babylon, but I have a very shaky grasp of rastafarianism. So I cast that thought onto the winds. Not that there was much in the way of wind that day. In fact, the air was eerily still. I held aloft the feathers of a carrion Crow and it did not so much as tremble. I discarded the feather on the edge of some scrub rife with goals and returned my gaze to the pale, fair thing, it was licking the last dregs of soup from its bowl. For as long as I can remember, I have had a deep interest in soup, and I was intrigued to know what had been in that bowl. It has always seemed a great pity to me that Dobson abandoned what would surely have been his magnum opus, a compendium of all known soup recipes from around the world throughout history. Before taking a step towards the pale face thing, I reached into the pocket of my Paraguayan man of destiny trousers, and took out a box of Swan Vestas. It would be useful to know if it was frightened of fire before getting any closer. bunching three or four matches together. I struck them across the sandpapery side of the box, and as soon as they lit, I flung them across the ditch which ran between me and the pale theists thing. With no scrub or gauze to ignite for I fell on a patch of bare Earth, the matches spotted out quickly, but not before the tiny flames had attracted the things attention. With dramatic results. It left for the now empty Super Bowl and scampered away towards the cops or spinny. This is not the place to go into detail about the difference between a cops and a spinny, which would involve giving dictionary definitions. So be content with the idea that the pale face thing was making off with surprising agility towards the clump of trees. They were a mix of punkten and simnel trees, and I worried that once it was within their shelter, I would lose sight of the thing for a while heavy with the budding spring foliage, fat leaves and dripping pods all enmeshed within a riot of twisting twining tendrils. Earlier in the week, on the Tuesday, I had won a tin cup for excellence in pole vaulting at a magnificent sports stadium in pointy town. Although a few days and passed without any further jumping about I was still fit, and I ought to have been able to vote the ditch with ease. As it was I crawled on a pebble during my run up and discombobulated somehow managed to topple over landing with a squelch at the bottom of the muddy trench. As with copses and spinneys. So with ditches and trenches. Don't worry about it. Just listen. The ditch was deeper than I thought. When eventually I clambered to my feet I saw that the mud walls loomed up much higher than my head, and days upon days of rainfall had worn them smooth. I'm very good at sizing up situations rapidly and astutely for I had been a tantaran cadet, and had the cap and the badges to prove it. Not that I was wearing them. Now of course, I trudge through the mud for at least a mile in both directions, and was astonished at the uniformity of the dictators depth and feature lessness. Nowhere did I come upon a place where I might gain a foothold on some dragon shard or clump of roots. Returning to the spot where I had first fallen, which I have marked cadet fashion by scraping tea for tan Tara beam into the muck with a pointed stick. I reached into another trouser pocket, took out my whistle and popped a shrill blast on it. This would, I hoped, summon the pale face thing back from its sanctuary in the spinny. Already you see I had worked out that if I was going to escape this ditch, I would need it help.

While I waited for it to come to me. My thoughts turned once again to Jah Rastafari. I wonder if my predicament was a separation imposed on me by jar for purposes only he knew this was so dispiriting that I was in danger of betraying my tantaran cadetship and succumbing to tears. Indeed, I even sniffled once or twice, I wanted something to smite, to snap me back to my usual gusto. But all I could see was a ditch beetle in a puddle at my feet. It was beyond smiting for it had already drowned. I popped on my whistle again. All I knew of the pale face thing other than its paleness and fierceness was that it was keen on soup and frightened by fire. These were the facts I had to work with. As far as I knew it might be death, and my whistling was in vain. What then I could recharge my steps along the ditch going further than a mile in each direction this time, hoping to find that clump or shard or even a ladder. But night was falling and I would be blundering About in the dark, better to remain here only yards away from the spinny or cops. I did not know what kind of creature the pail fit fist thing was, but it had a head and arms and legs, and possibly a tail. Though of that I was not certain. And I had to persuade myself that it also had a sense of compassion. Surely, it would want to rescue a pole vaulting tin cup winner, who was also an X 10 Tara bin cadet, it might even know something of jar, though that was unlikely. who truly knows jar, there can be comforting, theological speculation, even for a sinner such as me. I gave the whistle a third longer part and turned my mind to the Divinity or otherwise of Haile Selassie. As if on cue, the head of the pail theists thing, peeps down at me from the edge of the ditch. It had shockingly huge, bright eyes like those of a tamarind, but otherwise, there was nothing monkey like about that head. Somehow, I knew speech would be useless. I merely gazed up at it imploringly. Its head swivels left and right with insect speed, and then return to look at me again. In the mud. I stood to one side and pointed at my tea for 10 Tara been scraping did I see a flicker of understanding in those big tamarind eyes, it was hard to tell. A carrion crows swooped into land and perched on the ditches edge a little way from the pale face thing. It might have been the same crow from which I have plucked a feather to test the wind. Bird and thing looked at each other, and I was aware of an intensity in the space between them, mesmerizing. I see alien, utterly beyond anything I could comprehend. I squelched my boots in the mud. What would Haile Selassie do? What would God do? What apart from squelching? was I going to do? I've dredged up all I had learned as a tantaran cadet, testing the wind with the feather of a carrion Crow, always carrying a box of Swan investors and knowing how to strike them through or fourth time. Daily pole vaulting practice with rest periods. Never bringing a pan of soup to the boil and transferring the soup to the bowl with deft elegance. Never trying to eat soup with a fork. The carrion Crow and the pale face thing we're still gazing one to the other in an uncanny compact. Always buying soup bowls from humans, collecting the discount vouchers and tucking them neatly into the little Huberman discount voucher wallet provided being Spry and sprightly through the waking hours, and on ones pallet lying splayed out, checking the mercury six times a day, never using the string that ties one's tent pegs into a bundle as a leash for a dog. the naming of dogs to be restricted to pack or rags or spot, praising jar Rastafari discarding the pips from fruit with care. Never mixing soup with fruit. The sky was black now, but in the faint starlight I could see silhouetted, the carrion Crow and the pale face thing utterly still utterly in wrapped by each other.

knowing the difference between a Spinney and the cops knowing addict from a trench not being reliant on maps, marking one spot by scraping tea for 10 Tara beam in the mud with a pointed stick, always carrying a pointed stick. Having the pointed stick threaded through one's dreadlocks to keep the hands free, using the hands to smite things to revive gusto. Not smiting that which has drowned, tying knots, keeping one's cadet cap clean and dry. Daily polishing one's badges with a rag steeped in cadet badge Polish from humans, speculating upon the Divinity or otherwise of Haile Selassie regular study of Ethiopian history. It's doing frippery where air it raises its unseemly head. I had been taught that these kantara been cadetship skills would stand me in good stead throughout my days in Babylon, but now to unseemly heads turn to look down at me in the ditch in my ditch, the carrion Crow and the pale face thing and I knew I was lost.

Who Berman's department store was mentioned in that story. And it's also mentioned elsewhere in things I've read recently political balsa wood Crow, and a piece I read last week called Annals of the Frankish kings. So for those of you who need to catch up, and of course, all of these pieces can be read on the hooting yard website. www dot hooting yard.org. And anyway, I've had a couple of inquiries from readers and listeners, asking if Huberman department store has a mail order service. One of the requests is from someone called Tim thurn. And his request is rather more specific. Dear Frank, he writes, I'm on the lookout for a penis melting Zionist robot comb, not the kind of item A diffident chap like me is going to march into a shop and ask for even in a whisper. I wonder if Huberman runs a mail order service? And if so, whether this is the kind of thing I might find in its catalog? Well, Tim, even if Huberman did do mail order, this is not the kind of thing you'd expect to find in it. For the simple reason that a penis melting Zionist robot comb lacks gorgeousness. Only the gorgeous is to be found in that legendary department store, which of course is a byword for gorgeousness. The original shop was opened in 1909 by Jacopo Huberman and sold only cream crackers shellack and bays. It was yakko pose paramour loopy, and international woman of intrigue, who extended the range of stock to include other forms of gorgeousness. She believed firmly that the gorgeous could be found in all things both expensive and cheap, handcrafted and mass produced, decorative and functional. At times, her choices and those of the smitten Jacobo are questionable, and stretch the definition of gorgeousness to an alarming degree. loopy was very fond, for example, of mud splattered the Googles and filthy discarded things, some of which crumbled to dust when picked up. Just before the Great War, she was given the run of what became the bargain bin basement of Huberman in its new premises, fantasy eco monstrosity, which had previously been the headquarters of a SMERSH esque cabal. There were rumors that loopy continued the Cabal sinister business from her hidey hole next to the pneumatic piping system hub, but that was probably just tittle tattle queer stories attached themselves to yakko Huberman two, four It was said that his limp was exaggerated that his startling walrus mustache was counterfeit, that his pin number of sobriety mask the luening of a madcap and that his cakes were mere crumbs and breadcrumbs that that or false Of course, for the signal fact about Jacobo Huberman was that he shimmered like a saint. Today there is no bargain bin basement and the pneumatic piping system has been replaced by a new fangled Uber pneumatic piping system, but otherwise, who Bergman's is as it has been for nigh on 100 years, the brightest star in the retail sector firmament the absence of a mail order service, so perplexed Dobson that he wrote a pamphlet on the subject, which is regrettably out of print. He devoted almost 40 pages to worrying away at the problem, but was unable Excuse me. He devoted almost 40 pages to the problem, but was unable to reach a sensible conclusion. By the time he finished writing his essay, he was in such a foul temper that marigold Chu dragged him off to the snack bar at who Berman's stuff his face with lemon meringue pie. Incidentally, the snack bar at Huberman is the very same snack bar where Lumberton stalks the snack bar hooligans mentioned at the end of a piece I wrote, I wrote and read here the other week called kargh pan, and better And so we find that everything in this world is linked by loops of intricate yet unfathomable significance. or so it seems.

On the hooting yard website, the address of which I've mentioned, you can of course now leave comments on the pieces which appear there. And this should be compulsory I think. But when that piece about who Berman's department store appeared on the website, there was a comment from someone called Kristen shatavari. Who wrote I should mention that who Berman's without an apostrophe provides an arresting contrast or who Berman's with an apostrophe, which Frank has described. The store I speak of can be found between the gasworks and the rendering plant it acts on the vog. If you were to enter this huge, impossibly damp and decaying building, your first sight would not be an array of exquisite booths, proffering perfumes and pomades but a heaving jostling market selling rancid meat and putrifying vegetables, noise some pests, swarm and crunch beneath your feet and all manner of vermin scary and contest with the feral children for the repulsive scraps leftover from the day's business. Who Berman's is also famous for its seminar carrying brutish store lackeys, each of whom has sworn to enforce a particularly draconian religious code. Their brains have been addled by a tar like tobacco, which they true, blackened saliva drooling from their gap toothed Moore's customers should be advised to keep their distance because of their habit of xpect rating on one of the many thousands of spittoons at least one of which can be found next to any of the stores guard stations, could there be a less gorgeous place on earth? And to which another comment was upended from this time from outer space man who said in answer to could there be a less gorgeous place on earth? Littlehampton?

So there you go. If you take the opportunity to comment on on the hooting yard website who knows your comment could be read out on the show, and you've got a little warm glow in your heart, no doubt. And this is called pebble head versus pebble head. The annotation has been carried out on a scale which is necessarily extensive, but which seeks at the same time to be as economical as possible in face of the twin challenges of Browning's wide range of curious information and his immense and flexible vocabulary. Without the prior labors of a cook to draw upon preparation of the body of notes would have been an even more formidable task that in fact was. Despite all that has been transported to the present site from cooks commentary, a great deal of ore remains in that capacious mine. So wrote Richards de alltech in his introduction to the penguin English poets edition of Robert Browning's the ring and the book, which appeared in 1971. Curiously, in the very same year, exactly the same words we used and I mean exactly. With Dobson instead of browning and pebble head in place of cook The first edition of the mighty complete annotated Dobson edited by Ted Kak. The title was a misnomer, of course, because at that time 1971 Dobson still had a few years left, during which he penned some of his most awe inspiring pamphlets. In fact, recent job sonian scholarship has shown that if anything, cacs toe might better have been called the thoroughly incomplete annotated Dobson. That's not to cast aspersions on what remains a truly engaging work, and it was the first serious attempt to annotate Dobson in a systematic way. The pebble head CAC refers to the author of the capacious mine of commentary where in lies a great deal of or yet to be recovered, was the father of shachar pebble head, the writer of all those best selling paperbacks, you find that airport bookstores. It's regrettable in some ways that the achievements of pebble head pear have been roundly eclipsed by the fame of pebble head fees, to the point where today, the old man's majestic commentary on Dobson is forgotten by all but a few. And those few all in their dotage, dribbling and drooling brains with and and mind twitching and shattered. Ted cacs work to which as he acknowledges draws so heavily upon the elder pebble head seems destined for the scrapheap, not least because the younger people head king of the paperback potboiler seems bent on obliterating all printed traces of his power. He uses the considerable wealth he has accrued from the transients guff he pedals to buy up and burn on bonfires, not just his pals own work, but any books, periodicals, journals, chat books, pamphlets, video cassettes and DVDs, which so much as mentioned his name. It's not for me to propose a psychological explanation for this preposterous campaign of pebble heads, which smacks of atavistic impulse an ancient myth. Plenty of amateurs have tried their hand at doing so, with laughable results. Only last week, there was some codswallop in the daily unhinged, claiming that an incident from the younger pebble heads infancy involving a sewing kit. a swarm of Africanized killer bees, and a newspaper reporter of the Munich air disaster was at the root of the matter. As usual, there was no proof, no evidence, merely the delivering of a witless hat trying to jumpstart their career. As a corrective to such drivel, I've decided to set up a fighting fund to rescue the work of pebble head pair from Oblivion, while simultaneously urging a boycott of pebble head fees, best selling paperbacks. Among those already signed up by Carlos Santana, Lembit opik, Dale Winton, Dustin Hoffman, and some of the top names in football, including toward grip, pencil, crouch and caca. I hope you will join them.

So that's the end of hooting yard for this week. And I've just been informed. Although I didn't know this myself. I've just been informed that after I mentioned crouch and caca last week, my boss had a fairly poor game The following day, or whenever it was, or even the same evening. And that toward grip lost his job fairly soon after I mentioned him in an earlier show. So perhaps there's some kind of Curse of hooting yard. If anyone's got any thoughts on that, you know how to contact me, send me an email, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
