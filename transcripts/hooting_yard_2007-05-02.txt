Good afternoon. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air, a special edition without any theme music well, without any theme music at the beginning of the show for extremely complicated and quite dull technical reasons. Anyway, on with the show, and here's here's the first piece of prose. I beg your pardon. I never promised you a rose garden. Go and look at the paperwork, where it is clearly stated that I promised you a ditch rife with puddles and nettles, teeming with tiny creatures, worms flatworms, things with hundreds of legs and vibrating antenna, things with bombas globular eyes and things with no eyes at all. It is also made crystal clear that this ditch is designed to surround your chalet like a moat, and that no roses will grow in it. A towering hollyhock or two perhaps, but not a single rose. Why on earth do you think that I promised you a rose garden? How dare you accuse me of tampering with the papers? Are you seriously suggesting that I text out whole paragraphs of the original and use the scratchy nib to insert a completely different shedule of works? You're casting aspersions upon my skills as a landscape designer of note, and inferring that I am but a brute armed with a spade. I traveled the length and breadth of the country to find you specimens of the creepy crawlies you requested. Rare maggots, weird blind, wriggling transparent nightcrawlers, slithering horas and all the rest. There was no rainfall for weeks on end, so I created those puddles with my bare hands. Cutting bucket after bucket of duck pond water from the brackish duck pond over yonder beyond the municipal bandstand. It would have been a lot easier to plant a few roses in the ground, believe me. Yes, I know you did not call me a brute with a spade Those were my words, but that is what you would have said. Were you a man of plain speech, rather than a pompous puffed up milk SOP given to Jeju. Critical circumlocution? Has it occurred to you that you're very verbosity may have contributed to you getting addicted, dug around your chalet instead of a rose garden. You could have said to me, I'd like a rose garden please. And I would have taken that on board. But oh no. such simple language is not your style. You did not say I'd like a rose garden please. I refute that utterly. If you had said that. Why would I be cluttering three files of paperwork which clearly show that you asked for a moat like ditch rife with puddles and nettles and creeping creatures to be dug to the depths of six feet around your chalet without any provision for a drawbridge? Do you think I just made that up off the top of my head? Why would I do that? ditch digging is back breaking work, especially when you only have one old rusty, dented, bent and battered spade to work with. Try it yourself. There is no drawbridge straddling the ditch because you clearly specified that you did not require one. Yes, that did perplex me, but I assumed you were planning to volt the ditch on those long spidery legs of yours. It's preposterous to argue now that you did not ask for a drawbridge because you would not need one to gain access to this putative rose garden you keep harping on about when you stop banging your fists on that portcullis? Well, I'll grant you that it is indeed unusual to find a portcullis blocking the door of a chalet where there is no accompanying drawbridge, for to usually go together. I agree. And no, nowhere in the bundle of papers Do you request the installation of a massive cast iron portcullis, requiring the strength of 10 muscular peasants to wind it up, which is why it doesn't come with a winch or any kind of leavers or pulleys or such contrivances. I'm a landscaper, just not an engineer. If you recall on the 10th day that the works were being carried out on your dick, I told you that I would be unavailable on the following Thursday, as I have to attend the presentation of a prize cup far far away in a distant cold and mountainous land. Your immovable portcullis was installed in my absence by rogues. It has nothing to do with me.

Frank Key  04:53
I have had quite enough of this. I'm about to send my messenger Starling to perch on your portcullis tuck the bank knows In the ring around its leg and flap your arms as a spur to send it back to me. If you do not do so, I'm going to go and fetch my rusty old dented, bent and battered spade, and I will fill in your ditch, the puddles and the nettles and the teeming creeping creatures will vanish under piles of muck and mud and soil. And you will cut a follow on figure, a Jesuit tickle milk stop hammering on your portcullis, a man without a dick.

We all know that there was an age known as the epoch of snares, but it is surprising how little is generally known about it. This was a time when giant badger like beings roamed the hills of the earth. When the oceans were deeper, darker and more terrifying than they are now. And when only the very bravest of souls volunteered to crew the enormous primitive container ships that plied across those seas. It was an age of seething murderousness of great cosmic shifts of roaring winds that uprooted the few pitiful scraggly vegetation that struggled for life in soil that was not soil as we know it today. In the epoch of snares, soil was much more friable, and crumbly, and sometimes even very crumbly. It seldom had the compactness or density to hold the plant secure from the biting winds. The same winters intense coldness seemed somehow to inspire the giant badger like beings up in the hills. There were more hills then higher, more rounded, covering vast expanses. In those times, shoes had not been invented. Hard to imagine that the fearsome burly sailors on those container ships did everything they had to do in bare feet, or sometimes wearing sock like wrappings. We no longer know how such things were made, from what materials with what technology for all the wrappings that were ever worn have perished, and our only evidence is some briskly scribbled drawings done with the aid of a clairvoyant whose bruise when taken in sufficient quantities enabled her to picture the past or so she claimed. Men and women were outnumbered by pelicans in those days, some estimates say there were 200 pelicans to every person, but these were not our modern pelicans. They came in all sizes, some as tiny as hamsters, others bigger than the biggest of the giant badger like beings that roam the windswept hills. Some would have it that a huge asteroid from a faraway galaxy, lumbered with millions upon millions of eggs smashed into the earth, and the impact shattered those alien eggs and from them the pelicans hatched but this is a frankly ludicrous theory, and one not given credence when one considers that it was propounded by a Jew burring maniac chained to the wall of a cellar in a bleak and derelict village. That maniac is my brother, so I know whereof I speak. Indeed, so deciduous of my studies been these last 50 years that I believe I know more about the epoch of snares than anyone else alive. I know what freight was carried in those primitive container ships that crossed ceaselessly from shore to shore bales. a staggering number of bales of every size and description, handled and washed over with infinite care by those fearsome fearless sailors, a special breed so different from the weedy landlubbers who vied for scarce resources with innumerable pelicans, and so nearly lost the struggle. But of course, the pelicans were all wiped out in just one winter, and even I do not know how that happened. The epoch of snares is notable too because it was an era when only one type of cloud appeared in the sky, namely the anvil cloud. The Anvil cloud is the description for the upper portion of a towering cumulonimbus mostly ice, which forms high in thunderstorms, and never constant thunderstorms at that time. People did not then fear thunder and lightning as many do today. Nor did the pelicans fear the rack and row of storms. But what do you think it was that had all those giant badger like beings charging back and forth over the hills? terror is the answer. terror of thunder in particular, these strange beasts is what hypersensitive could hear things that people and pelicans could not. And whatever it was, they heard in the thunder filled them with fear, and so they would be forever seeking a place of safety, but never finding one, for they never came down from the high hills. The Badger beings to died out, but not at the same time as the pelicans. Geological upheavals have flattened many of the hills where they crashed around in panic, and no one has yet found any trace of their bones. Perhaps it's true what my brother says that the Badger beings never existed. We're about a vapor in the brain of some historical fantasy list. But I doubt he can be right about that, and so hopelessly ridiculously wrong about the pelicans. I hope you will concur. As we have seen,

the people of that time had no shoes, nor did they have saints. As far as I've been able to ascertain. They did not have what we would today think of as a religion. To be sure they subscribe to a cosmic journey. They had some dim, dull witted inkling of how the earth and the heavens, the sun and the moon and the stars and anvil clouds all fitted together. But it was not one I've wasted time trying to understand, for it was clearly idiotic. I have in my pouch, a diagram made by that clairvoyant I mentioned earlier, which purports to show the universe as understood in the epoch of snares, but it's a slapdash diagram, and I feel only muddies waters already murky enough. And why everyone asks sooner or later, is this long ago age known as the epoch of snares? Why not the epoch of bales of badger beings of interplanetary paint pelicans? Why not the epoch of enormous primitive containerships that plied across the seas? Why not Indeed, the epoch of no shoes go to the bleak and derelict village, enter that dark, dank cellar, approached the gibbering maniac chained to the wall, asked my brother, he will tell you

that last piece that ecopy POC of snares mentioned that one point millions and millions of eggs on another planet, and regular listeners know how much my work varies from one story to the next. And lo and behold, the story coming up also features millions and millions of eggs on a faraway planet. And it's quite a good time to mention that hooting yard on the air will be broadcast next week. From the Roundhouse as part of the space soon season on resonance from the eighth to the 13th of September when normal programming will be canceled and only paranormal programming will occur. So this is called This is a sort of treat really, pre a prequel to not a prequel In other words, a foretaste of space stuff coming up, and this is a piece called far far away. Far far away, there is a galaxy of shattered stars, stars crumpled and curdled and destitute. And there is a planet tucked in among these sorry stars, a tiny pink planet of gas and water and thick foliage, untapped in among the fronds and creepers and enormous leaves of this foliage, like millions of unhatched eggs, and when they hatch, they will hatch millions of magnetic mute blind love monkeys.

I am a crew member of the starship corrugated cardboard, heading implacably through deep space towards the galaxy of crumbled stars. Seven years into the voyage. Only four of us remain from the original manifest of 20 there is my captain. Oh my captain pill brow, a hirsute raving martinet. We have tied him with cords and confined him to a cover For he has become impossibly dangerous. His spittle is sulfurous. It burns that which it touches. And as he raves, he spits and he is never not raving, not any more. Ever since we passed through the belt of illegible, pale brow seems no longer human. Being the science officer, I tried to study him at first, wearing big protective gloves. I transferred flex of his spittle into my alambic and ignited my Bunsen burners and peered intently at pill brows, burning spittle, hoping to learn something, I learned nothing. We have traveled far far beyond the belt of illegible and still I have learned nothing. Thus the binding with chords and vast the cupboard also surviving his pill brow to a half size version of my captain. Oh my captain, made of cardboard wax and string and animated with life by sparks of something akin to but not quite electricity. pill brow to is in Juba tably. Alive, a pulsating rustling, thinking breathing thing, but it has nothing in common with the writing martinet tied by chords in the cupboard. At the beginning of the voyage, we considered changing its name. We even spent a few days calling it unpeeled brow or anti pill brow, but neither of these caught on possibly because pill brow two would boom. My name is pill brow to in its deafening voice. Our cardboard wax and string crewmate has been invaluable in keeping our spirits up. I do not think we would still be heading for the galaxy of crumpled and destitute stars and for the tiny pink planet. If it were not for his her its determination. Lumpkin would have had us turn back. I'm sure of it. Lumpkin is the other survivor. He has been morose and sullen since we ran out of breakfast cereal two years ago. After missing the supplied Depo on the planet of grocery provisions epsilon six, where we were due to collect a consignment of Kellogg's fruit and fiber. He keeps to his bunk now, head buried in a metal back copy of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. His pipe clenched in his teeth, the fumes of his untreated Serbian tobacco hanging in the pseudo air of the cabin. At least it kills the flies. The bullet riddled corpses of our dead crew mates all 16 of them, a coffin up and the coffins stacked as a makeshift ping pong table. we clear the space in the cargo hold by Jessen jettisoning we clear the space in the cargo hold, by jettisoning some crates of irrelevant rubbish we were meant to be delivering to one of the outlying mini planets of Hubbard world. They will be held to pay if we ever get home. But home seems so far away now. So far, far away. pill brow to is a superb ping pong player. Nevertheless, it's bad to get caught in its string, but I am better. We have played thousands of games over the years and I have won nearly all of them sometimes without losing a point because it has no hard pill brow to is not disheartened and comes to every match with the same valiant perkiness that keeps us plunging ever further through space towards the galaxy of shattered stars. One afternoon, after a particularly grueling ping pong match pill brow to confess to me that what kept it going? What kept it tweaking the boosters to increase our speed, even at the cost of sending the starship into joggers, which popped some of the bolts on the pseudo air seals was that it was filled with a burning lust for the as yet unhatched magnetic commute blind love monkeys patiently awaiting birth

on the tiny pink planet. This was the first I had heard of them. I became confused and flung question after question the half size cardboard wax and the string simulacrum of my captain. Oh, my captain, but it answered none of them. Instead, it showed me pages of twee love poetry it had been writing and led me to a corner of the cargo hold, where it had hidden a stash of love tokens, mostly things made out of some kind of tin flowers and lockets and broaches, finicky bitty Bob's it was going to bestow upon the magnetic commute blind love monkeys once they were born. When I applied tested that there were supposedly millions of these monkeys pill brow to explain to me with a winsome sigh that it's love knew no bounds and nor did it last for when it had been programmed back in the lab that gave it life. A stray spark had imbued it with a super abundance of love and lust and ping pong perkiness. I wondered whether to share these revelations with lumpen but what would be the use patting pill brow on to on its cardboard head. I picked up my ping pong back and challenged it to another game, and we played and played and played as my captain. Oh, my captain pill brow raved and spat and struggled with his binding cords in his cupboard. We played and played as a lump and smoked his pipe and read Ayn Rand for the thousandth time, we played as the starship corrugated cardboard hurtled inexorably through space towards the galaxy of stars shattered and stars crumbled, stars curdled, and stars destitute. Were in Nestle the tiny pink planet of gas and water and thick foliage were in nestled millions of unhatched eggs were in nestled millions of unhatched magnetic mute blind love monkeys are waiting they're unlikely Romeo, a cardboard wax and string simulacrum of my captain, my captain called pill brow to baring poetry and love tokens far, far away.

Out of all the characters that populate hooting yard and there abouts. One of the most popular or one of the most popular I think could become those magnetic mute blind love monkeys.
