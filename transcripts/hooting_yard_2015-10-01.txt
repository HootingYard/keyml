Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. We're going to begin this week as we have done for the last few weeks with some more further science from Norman Davis. From a book or pamphlet published in 2001, and possibly the greatest book ever written bomb, or bar one of which more later. Anyway, this week from further signs book 20.

The other day I popped into the town hall to find out a bit about bins, park benches, signage, flowerbeds, and civic statuary. I think it's time to engage more fully with the maintenance of my baby, wic and the municipal doings. They're in This impulse was prompted when sitting on a park bench next to a civic statue of the much missed alderman found out alongside, which was a bin in which we'd hold from a flower bed had been chucked, I read a sign placed there by the Council, which implored me and I suppose anybody else who read it to refrain from smoking within the precincts of the park to tidy up after my dog, though I did not have a dog as such, to ensure I paid my Council Tax promptly, and to place any letter I wish to discard in the been provided. Each of these instructions or pieces of advice or commands, or whatever we might call them, was translated into several languages. It was a bloody big piece of signage. Incidentally, for those of you attuned to the resonances of the color spectrum, the bench was brown. The statue was gray with patches of green, the bin was black, and the weeds were weirdly gak gold vermillion. I wouldn't have put them in pain, have taken them home and arrange them in a vase and placed it on my mantle piece. If I had a mantel piece, the sign itself was bathed with the writing and read. If I had to be more precise, I would say it was blood red. I did not at the time understand why this might be significant.

If I had either a dog or a mantelpiece I might not have been so quick to visit the town hall. Both would have have both would have claims on my attention. I would have to take the dog for walkies and shop for biscuits and give it Bob's and possibly take it to the vet for injections from time to time. As for a mental piece that would need dusting, I suppose. And minor upkeep such as the patching up of crumbly bits if it was rotting, and also much time spent in judicious contemplation of items to display upon it and the arrangement there all of those two would have to be dusted in addition to the mantel piece itself if I were to avoid becoming engulfed by dust, and thus have trouble with my breathing apparatus one day but unencumbered as I was by both dog and mantlepiece. When I held myself out of bed that morning, I was free to go along to the town hall without other duties to distract me.

I know nothing of architecture, but by God I recognize municipal pride expressed in brick and concrete when I see it. I must have walked past the town hall numberless time without paying any attention. Now, I stopped by now I stopped on the steps to take in its majestic frontage. Gosh, feeling somewhat belittled, I entered through the grand doorway. I did not have an appointment with anybody. So when I presented myself at the reception desk I was treated with a certain disdain. Perhaps I was mistaken for a mendicant I suppose I ought to avoid my hair, and more or less grubby cravat for what I considered a pretty momentous visit. I was pointed towards the role of plastic chairs and told to sit and wait. Before taking my seat. I browse through a rack of leaflets affixed to the wall and took a few of them to pass the time. Coincidentally, the very first leaflet I read concerned, alderman find out whose statue I have sat beside in the park. I learned that his title of alderman had no civic significance. But he had been so called because he was an expert, albeit an amateur one on the subject of older trees, with which the park was riddled. I burned to an enthusiasm for trees ran in the family, and that he had a cousin who also bought the name of a German prison who was known as Sycamore man. Fascinating as all this was, it had nothing to tell me bins and park benches and signage and flower beds or of civic factory in general. So I tapped relief that into an in a pocket for safekeeping and turn my attention to the next one in my clutch. It was all about food poisoning. Again, not my immediate concern, though I noted it managed to work in a mention of alderman Spandau claiming his death have been groomed. Due to the unwise ingestion of several contaminated eggs on toast. There was no reference to his cousin, although yet another German prison was alluded to, for reasons which I could not quite pin down. I replaced this leaflet in the rack. As I was doing so, a council person emerged from behind the panel and approached me is hand held out in greeting. Seldom have I beheld such glistening buttons. This councilperson gave off a powerful reek of spam and hair oil, but I was impressed by his politesse as he led me up staircases, and along corridors towards his office. He explained that following a rash of complaints about surliness and the grumps, the municipal authorities had trained their entire workforce in the manners and morals of the Imperial Court of Austria Hungary, circa 1844. This had worked wonders in what he nevertheless termed the public interface skill set. I couldn't help thinking what alderman Spandau would have made of it all. But then I remembered that he was merely a tree enthusiast rather than a civic dignitary. I haven't looked into the matter, but I assume that the word dignitary comes from the same root as dignity. This was a quality singularly lacking, I'm afraid to say, among the members of the current council administration, a framed photograph of whom was prominently displayed on the wall of the office into which I was led. They were pictured together in a field lined up as if they were a sports team, and he had a glassy eyed stare. Each for an unfortunate Cagoule. I noticed there was a dog mercifully unka Gould in the front row, and asked joshing Lee if it too, was a counselor, or just a mascot. To my surprise, the council person replied that the dog Skippy by nine was actually the map of our bailiwick, it had won more votes than all the other councillors put together. The rest of them are a complete shower. He said brightly as if he were Terry Thomas, but needs must when the devil drives.

I observed that Skippy apart, all the counselors looked as if they had had their brains removed, let us say, modified, he replied. In frigging, as this revelation was, I did not want to waste time talking about the councillors. I put it to the council person, that I was ready and willing to contribute manfully, and with gusto, to all matters pertaining to bins and park benches and signage and flowerbeds and civic statuary. But before I could do so, I needed to know more about the mall. He made a great show of puffing his buttons with a silken kerchief and said, Oh, I wouldn't worry your little potato shaped head about such things. Skippy has everything under control. Though reassured in terms of the maintenance of civic order, I was somewhat deflated, was there no way I protested that I could play the part of an active citizen. I passed over the comment about the shape of my head, for I did not think it had been meant unkindly. And after all, my head is on the small side, and it does resemble a potato. This is often remarked upon by people, but usually at times when conversation has fallen flat, and they're desperately trying to think of something to say. The council person had no such problem. Indeed, he began babbling a stream of what I took to be boilerplate municipal jargon. It was unremittingly opaque, and he must have noticed my eyes glazing over for suddenly he grabbed me by the elbow and ushered me towards the window. There, he shouted, pointing. That is what I'm talking about the municipal monkey pound. I looked, and sure enough, just past the car park and a clump of all the trees, there was a pound and it was full of monkeys. at ground level, you would never recognize it, but from a high window. Up here in the Civic Imperium, there was no mistaking it. I was wrapped. Explain it to me again. This time without the jargon. I said this, it seemed was too much to ask. He insisted I would get the hang of things. Plop the cap on my head and pin the badge to my lapel. Five minutes later, we were outside at the electronic gate of the monkey pound and he was pressing a buzzer. Ah, Sheva. Next, he said as a civic function re emerge from a heart to open the gate. Here is our new volunteer. And I was in. I was doing my bit for the council, not as I had hoped to in the realm of bins and park benches and signage and flower beds and civic statuary. But nonetheless, I had my foot in the door. I was an active civically minded citizen. chevin X, the monkey pound supervisor proved to be the most unfailingly helpful person I have ever met in any capacity. He gave me a brush to read my volunteers cap of accumulated filth, and a rag to polish my volunteers bag. And he took me on a guided tour of the monkey pound, and he told me more about it than any sane person could wish to know. Quite unbeknown to me, our baby wick had been plagued for some years by monkeys. And not just any monkeys, but monkey vampires. These were qualitatively different from vampire monkeys I was given to understand, but I'm hazy on the details, and chevin ik soon passed on to other matters. The monkey vampyres had all been rounded up from their nests and hiding places in kennels and air vents and pavilions. And were impounded here in the pound behind the carpark and the clump of all the trees pending a decision on whether or not they should be subject to extraordinary rendition.

Skippy was mulling it over, but it was low on his list of priorities. Some of those in the know wanted all the monkey vampires to be put in a sealed train like lemon and taken to the Carpathians. Others prefer the idea of ferrying the monkey vampires one by one to havens. There was even a body of opinion suggesting may be kept in the municipal monkey pound in perpetuity. chevin x did not divulged to me which, if any of these options had his backing, I suppose that as a functionary, he had to remain neutral. The monkey vampires themselves are fascinating, at least when visible. The Pound was constructed with many Trump re gardenia Bush's Mises baffles and cubbies. And it was possible to walk round and round for hours without seeing a single customer, as the council insisted on calling the impounded monkey vampires. Some I was told well velveteen and thrashed about in the darkness, others through pickle jars over the fence. When the moon was full, there was Keeling the smell was a mixture of nap blood and marzipan and bilgewater crocus's real ones grew in patches here and there. And sometimes very tiny, almost transparent monkey vampires could be seen sucking moisture from the bugs. shevin x had a sack stuffed with aerosol sprays, which he made judicious use of several of the monkey vampires a drone to count and were reportedly devising their own calendar. It had been noticed that no birds ever flew over the pound, with the exception of startled chaffinches. On a log, a pot of paint with a much dented need acted as a viewer. One of my fellow volunteers a bedraggled harpy of advancing years was in charge of Brazil nuts. I hoped to be given my own little sphere of influence one day. I've not been home since I got here. I sleep in a hammock in the corner of one of the mazes and do my ablutions in the paddling pool. I feed on Brazil on that Celeste and attended by the Harpy and suck moisture from crocus's. One thing Chevron did not tell me was that the municipal monkey pound was built on the side of a pauper's graveyard discovered this for myself by a combination of sharp wits and cemetery area addition, I have noticed unseemly traffic between the monkey vampires and the spirit of long dead paupers. It is going on all the time, as I lopsided angles, a common perception, or even the sense my quandary is whether to tell Chevron x, or the council person, or even Skippy the man. What do I know?

I said earlier that further science book 20 by Norman Davis was the greatest book ever written bar none. And then I corrected myself sidebar one because there is of course a great book. And it's published today. It's Mr. Keyes, shorter, potted brief, brief lived a compendium of very, very brief biographical nuggets or snippets, by me, and it's published by constable and it's available from all good bookshops in the real world and in cyberspace. So I do recommend, insist even that you can buy a copy now it's available. And over the last few weeks, I've been reading you selected extract. You can of course, now read the whole thing yourself. But we've got a few minutes. We've got about 10 minutes to show left. I'm going to read you a few more. I've read bits of A, B and C. Over the last few weeks. I'll read you some people big whose surnames begin with D. These are all extracts from Mr. Keyes, shorter potted brief, brief lives. JOHN Damien, Italian Alchemist 16th century Giovanni Damiano de falou t fal. coochie. sari was an alchemist at the court of King James is the fourth of Scotland, where he was known as john Damien or the French leak. In addition to the usual alchemical activity of transmuting base metal into gold, he organized dances and other entertainments, and in 1507, he made an attempt to fly to France from the battlements of Stirling castle. The result of this escapade was a broken thigh. Damian attributed his failure to the presence of too many hens feathers in his flying suit of mostly eagle feathers. And continuing on the bird theme, Birdman theme we have Angelo D'Arrigo, a French Sicilian ornithologist and aviator 1961 to 2006 dorrigo obtained to Andean Condor eggs from an Austrian University and determined to act as the unhatched birds mother, without whom they might not learn to fly. depositing the eggs in a nest at his aviary on the slopes of Mount Etna. He spoke to them daily to get the kicks inside used to the sound of his voice. Similarly, when they hatched, he covered the nest with a black and white hang glider shaped like a condor to accustom them to its shape and presence. He took trips in the glider and came back with food for the chicks, and also gave them flying lessons. Sadly, he was killed in a light aircraft crash in which he was a passenger, before he was able to return the candles to the Andes Charles Darwin English naturalist 1809 to 1882 had Robert Fitzroy the capital. of HMS Beagle followed his instinct. The history of science could have changed utterly. As Darwin recorded in his autobiography next day, I started for Cambridge to see henslowe and then to London to see Fitzroy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards on becoming very intimate with Fitzroy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of being rejected on account of the shape of my nose. He was an ardent disciple of love affair, and was convinced that he could judge the man's character by the outline of his features, and he doubted whether anyone with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage. But I think it was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had spoken falsely. Peter Maxwell Davis, English composer, born 1934, longtime devotees of hooting yard will be familiar with this one.

In 2005, Peter Maxwell Davis was cautioned by the police for having the remains of a whooper Swan in his possession. He claimed to have found the swan dead and electrocuted by a power line and to have taken it to his Orkney home to make a terrain of it. And to donate the wings to the local primary school. sidelight could be used as props in a nativity play. He had not considered that swans are a protected species. Although he did contact the local office of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds, who spokesman said he doesn't have to ring us to report dead swans, but I enjoy hearing from him because he's always good value.

First one must get up very early in the mornings. Second, above all, and most important, once a week, while must avoid dozing off again. I don't think I'm going to be leaving a very long life. I'll be back next week, hopefully. Bye bye. Plus
