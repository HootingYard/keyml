As listed by Francis Wheen in his biography of Tom dreiberg called Tom Greenberg, his life and indiscretions, fascinating book. I basically like anything that Francis Wainwright and the Tom dreiberg book is full of great anecdotes not not just the the like that great list of wedding presents. But did you know that circa 1968, there were plans for a brand new political party in this country, which would transform the face of British politics. The party which we would all i'm sure be voting for had it come into being was called logos. And the five person steering committee was Tom dreiberg. So Richard aqualand, who is a kind of saintly pacifist krisztian socialist, Paul foot, and those young revolutionaries of the time, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull, the inaugural meeting of logos took place in Soho in 1968. Tom dreiberg, so Richard Ackland and Paul Foote with their MC and Marianne couldn't make it. And it ended up in a gay bar in Soho and never met again.

See what you can learn by listening to hooting yard. I was at a swish cocktail party some time ago. dapper in my dad's leaning against a mantel piece. When I overheard a snatch of conversation. One chap told another trap how he'd lost his rag. My ears pricked up. I detached myself from my Rooster and stalked across to the chats, butting in on their chat, oblivious to the social niceties as is my way did you just say you've lost your rag? demanded is the bully bear the one of the pair? he mumbled some blather In response, but I was barely listening. And I continued I to have recently lost my rag. I wonder if there is a rag thief at large. You and I will join forces to recover our rags. The trap blinked, sized me up and in the manner of swish cocktail party guests. World over, discovered a sudden interest in someone or something on the far side of the room. I left the party shortly afterwards. dapper in my dad's with the conviction that there was more to the loss of my rag than I had previously realized. It was a couple of weeks before the night of the cocktail party, that I had lost my rag. It was a Wednesday. The sun that day was so bright it bleached the sky. I routed around in a drawer to find my sunglasses, the same girl where I kept my rag safe. But to my horror, it was gone. The rag I had treasured for years was not in the drawer, or nor was it anywhere else in the house, which I turned upside down in my increasingly frantic searching. Eventually I slumped in the middle of the floor and held my head in my hands and sobbed convulsively. grubby and greasy and tattered and stained. My rag was my talisman. It had been given to me one special day years and years before by a twinkly eyed ancient who pressed it into my hands as I was walking across sawdust bridge. Here Sonny take this rag, he croaked in a voice both sepulchral and wise. This is your rag, and so long as you keep it safe, no harm will ever before you. It is the rag of immortality. I never forgot those words. Even when the very next day harm did before me in the form of a sprained ankle. The result of an accident when cormorant hunting with my PA. I kept my faith in the rag. Common sense would suggest I was diluted but common sense could go hang. At first I kept the rag in my trouser pocket. Until one day I sense that it raggy power radiated far and wide and shoved it into a drawer where it nestled protecting me by it mysterious, grubby and greasy and tattered and stained effulgence the drawer I kept locked.

The morning after the cocktail party. I decided to track down the ball we barely trap who had also lost his rag. It turned out he was a quantity surveyor with an office just the other side of sawdust bridge I set out early snow had fallen under the bridge was strewn with a municipal salt and sand as I crunched across I was accosted by the twinkly eyed ancient from long ago now even more ancient and I noticed even more twinkly eyed, I do not mean that he had more eyes obviously but the two he had were twin player. You have lost your rag, he croaked in a voice even more support. crawlin wiser than I remembered. To regain the rag. You must go on a quest and face many perils. I see. I said. First, you must complete your crunchy crossing of sawdust bridge. On the other side. You will face the terrible lamp post of subaltern edweb passed by it with care and continue on to the squirrel tree path squelch through it to its end and then clamber over the pilings of reproach. Beware for the very pointy railings pilings make your way to the hideous gloomy Kevin. There you will be challenged by the grumpy man who dwells within the hideous gloomy Kevin. He will ask you three questions in his grunty boom, and you must answer them correctly. If you do so, he will allow you to pass on to the dilapidated air field where you must choose the one real airship from among a serried array of decoys airships fly in that to the mysterious important mountain upon the peak of which you will meet an adept of the way of trebizond local pepper. He will present you with a pair of skis, which we must buckle on, and then ski all the way down the mysterious important mountain until you reach the stricken Valley. Great of the perils of the stricken Valley, which you must overcome using skill and judgment and Brian he knows Oblique Strategies. Then you will come to the dense dark woods, you must find within them the thicket of clumps and go events to the clump of thickets. A tiny chortling man dressed all in green will meet you there and lead you to the ice cream kiosk of fate. Make sure you have enough coinage to buy a choc ice. It will be a poisoned chalk eyes, which will send you into a swoon. When you are awake, you will find yourself upon a raft out in the vast pitiless sea, out of sight of land. Friendly sea creatures will come on push the raft towards the dismal Island. It is inhabited by savages whom you must locate with conjuring tricks. They will sacrifice an albino hen in your honor. Read the message and it's hot bloody em trails. You will be told the next stage on your journey, which you will reach by hot air balloon. There you will find your rag, but it will be guarded by seven giants, each taller and fiercer than the last. You must slay each giant in turn, armed only with a pin cushion and a pencil sharpener. Then, to reach the rag last, you must swim across the lake of boiling tar and paddle through the puddle of boiling tar. You will find your rag in the nest of a swan. But it is no ordinary swan. It is a swan into whose head has been implanted a powerful computerized brain conceived by an impossibly intelligent homicidal maniac out with the swan and the rag is yours fail and you will no longer be immortal. You will suffer from plagues and a use and boils and sores and eventually you will die. Can I take the quantity surveyor with me? I asked. You may not. You must set out alone to regain your lost rag.

So that's what I did. I completed my crunchy crossing of sawdust bridge. On the other side I faced the terrible lamppost of Ibadan edweb. Passing by with care. I continued on to the squelch free path and squelch through it to its end, and then I clambered over the pilings of reproach they were very pointed pilings. I made my way to the hideous gloomy Cavin, where I was challenged by the grunty man who dwells within the hideous gloomy Kevin. He asked me three questions in his grunty boom, and I answered them correctly. So he allowed me to pass on to the dilapidated airfield where I chose the one real airship from among a salaried array of decoys, airships. I flew in that to the mysterious important mountain upon the peak of which I met an adept of the way of trebizond Oh, Cole pepper. He presented me with a pair of skis, which I buckled on and then skied all the way down the mysterious important mountain until I reached the stricken Valley. Great Well, the perils of the stricken Valley, which I overcame using skill and judgment and Brian, he knows Oblique Strategies. Then I came to the dense dark woods, I found within them the thicket of clumps and went then to the clump of thickets. A tiny chortling man dressed all in green met me there and led me to the ice cream kiosk of fate. I made sure I had enough coinage to buy a truck ice. It was a poisoned choc ice, which sent me into a swoon. When I awoke, I found myself upon a raft out in the vast pitiless sea, out of sight of land. Friendly sea creatures, cavemen pushed the raft towards the dismal Island. It was inhabited by savages who my poor kated with conjuring tricks. They sacrificed an albino hand in my honor. I read the message in it hot, bloody and trails, I was told the next stage on my journey, which I reached by hot air balloon. There I found my rag, but it was guarded by seven giants, each taller and fiercer than the last. I had to slay giant in turn, armed only with a pin cushion and a pencil sharpener. Then, to reach the rag last, I had to swim across the lake of boiling, tar and paddle, paddle through the puddle of boiling tar. I found my rag in the nest of a swan, but it was no ordinary swan. It was a swan into whose head had been implanted a powerful computerized brain conceived by an impossibly intelligent, homicidal maniac. I managed to outwit the swan claimed my rag and made my way back to sawdust bridge. There was no sign of the twinkly eyed ancient, but I saw the quantity surveyor heading home from work. I accosted him and told him I had got my last rag back. I thought he'd be pleased, but his eyes filled with tears. And he said What does it profit a man that he regains his rag, but knows not the measure of the quantities he has surveyed. And he swept past me hugging his briefcase to his chest and trudged away into the salt and sand strewn streets as night came crashing down.

Only five minutes left. I think there's time for this. This is a quotation from Alfred when they won't be time if I have a coughing fit. This is a quotation from Alfred Wesley Wishart A Short History of monks and monasteries to monks took the blood of a duck which they renewed every week. This they put into a file, one side of which consisted of a thin, transparent crystal, the other thick and opaque. The Dark Side was shown until the center's gold was exhausted. When presto change, the blood appeared by turning the other side of the file in numerable, toe pairings bones, pieces of skin three heads of St. Ursula and other anatomical relics of departed St. was said to cure every disease known to man. There is more of that peace. That's the end of the quotation. There's more of that piece. But I don't think we've got time for that this week. For various reasons, we're going to bring this show to a close now, because what's left of the what's left of the piece is is too long to read. And my little coughing fit there didn't help. However, we've also got another problem, which is that the entire audio infrastructure of resonance FM has collapsed around our ears. And you're not going to be able to hear the hooting yards theme music at the end of the show. There are various attempt men in in special protective clothing has zoomed into the studio with blow torches and scanners and other equipment trying to work out what's going on. I'm impressed at the way they are able to keep the silence as they work tirelessly to restore the audio infrastructure which has collapsed around our ears. See what I did there? I repeated the thing so you wouldn't forget what I'd said. Yes, I'm babbling now. This is the end of hooting out on the air for this week. As ever, I encourage you to go and visit the hooting yard website where there is much to read. also links to all the podcasts you Might be listening to that now. Much to read pictures to look at books to buy. And you can make a donation or take out a subscription, all sorts of excitements at hooting yard. And if you're going to make a donation to hosting yard, make a donation to resonance as well, because this, you're only hearing me babble like this because of the tireless volunteering of many, many people, including me, I should add, who come into the studio, and even when the audio infrastructure has collapsed around our ears, we come in and we do our bit to keep you entertained, amused, instructed, and educated and morally uplifted, and all sorts of other things. Right. That's the end of hooting out for this week. I shall say goodbye. This has been Frank k with hooting yard for the seemingly the umpteenth time, and I shall be back next week as ever. I might even tell you a bit more about the blood of ducks if you're lucky. Bye bye.
