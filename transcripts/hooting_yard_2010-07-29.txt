pals it's me Frank key with this week's shooting yard on the air was a very jolly introduction. See if I can keep up that tone of jollity. And a father Ninian tongue lash the Jesuit priest and self styled soutine are tired nemesis of sea monsters, who appeared in my dream last week. And who I mentioned on last week's show was I would have, you know, a real historical figure. He's often thought to be fictional, probably because the only reliable biography we have of him by pebble head pair was published in the form of a series of short episodes between the covers of pulp magazines, such as mildly alarming stories, yarns that might raise your blood pressure just a tad and vaguely disquieting tales. That the various scattered pieces were never brought together as a proper book is one of literature's indeedy, life's great tragedies, and the blame must lie squarely with pebble head pair himself. For all his learning and wisdom and panache as a biographer, he was a very bewildering person. Even just walking down the street, he left a swathe of bog allied bewilderment in his wake, and the captains of ships were ever reluctant to have him aboard their pleasure steamers, but will bring to his his treatment of the life of father tongue lash, quite apart from its being broken up into bits and published in magazines, designed for a readership of the semi literate and the timid and the nerve be jangled. Although what research has been done seems to confirm that pebble had pears accounts are historically accurate, indeed, devastatingly so. Each episode is written, each episode as written is almost identical. The general schema is as follows. One, Father Ninian tongue rash I've just finished saying mass when an urge in sprint panting into the vestry to announce that the sea monster has been sited either a ship or a boat, or a coastal Hamlet is imperiled. To without stopping to ask any questions, even something as basic as in which direction he should speed, Father tongue black, grabs a harpoon and a crucifix and charges out into the wild and windy shore land. It is invariably wild and windy. Three, after a little while of harem, scarem scampering the priest stops as Christ stopped at eberly. And all wind swept and resolute takes from his pocket a volume of poems by his friend and colleague father, Gerard Manley Hopkins. He opens the book at random and declaims a poem shouting into the wind. declaiming done, he returns the book to his pocket makes the sign of the cross and scampers onward. The panting urchin who brought the message of sea monster peril, has now had time to catch up with the priest and now sticks close to his heels. For father Ninian arrives at the scene of impairment and confronts the sea monster. He is absolutely fearless. I am retired in the SU team of a Jesuit and I am your nemesis, he cries. At this point, the sea monster usually makes a gurgling sound we are led to interpret as a plea for God's ineffable mercy. But father Ninian shows none. He hands the crucifix to the panting urging, telling the land to brandish it at the sea monster. Then he launches the harpoon with honoring accurately felling the sea monster instantly. Five. It is an interesting point that all of the sea monsters harpooned by the Jesuit, were of the kind that when struck, shrivel up and vanish in a puff of cloudy gaseous green vapor. Six father tongue lash reveals in his harpoon, Pat's the panting urgyen on the head, retrieves its crucifix and acknowledges the groveling gratitude of those whose impairment he has quashed, be like this crew have a ship or a boat, or the peasant inhabitants of a coastal Hamlet.

Seven as the priest went his way back to his vestry table head pair does three things he makes note based upon what sources he never reveals of all the types of birds in the sky and perched upon branches, which the Jesuit were he looking would see upon his journey. He makes some attempt not always successfully to elucidate various sea monster references hidden in the text of the Gerard Manley Hopkins poem declaimed by Father tongue lash earlier in the episode. Lastly, and characteristically he ends each piece with a flourish of distinctively bewildering prose. As a top pebble had faith, the best selling paperback was taught this seven point plan of literary composition as his pair dubbed it. Careful listeners will still find traces of the technique and some of the pop boilers that pour out of the shallow prose day after day. Consider, for example, even so recent a blockbuster as the Jesuit and the sea serpent, which follows the pattern almost exactly despite being over 1000 pages fat with a gold embossed cover, making it suitable for airport book kiosks.

I'm satisfied that discouraging news reaches me about Dennis beer pint. The weedy poet has, it seems, cast off his beatnik persona. In an interview with the magazine, ex beatnik poet speak out, he says. People will accuse me of selling out but quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of sticking it to the man you dig. There's no money in it. I want to be a people's poet like Caroline Duffy or Ian McMillan, but I'm neither the poet laureate nor an irritating professional Northerner, so when the co op offered me the position of surrealist in residence, I jumped at the chance. surreal is a much abused word these days, but it's surely appropriate to describe the beer pints first effort on the CO ops behalf. He was asked to add an intriguingly Madcap line to the allergy advice on their jam doughnuts and came up with this Corker. These products have been prepared in an area that handles the following ingredients celery, crustaceans, fish, lupins, and mollusks. Clearly though he may indeed have sold out Dennis Pierpont has not lost his Mojo.

I am the hermit of the dingley Dell. God is the dingiest Dells. That is why I chose it for my hermitage. It's glades and dingles are abundant with those things which provide for a hermit's simple needs, such as nuts and fruits and reels of fresh water. Every now and then, in a real a fish might swim by deploying my net with practiced skill. I catch the fish. Then I will sit before a fire toasting the fish upon a fork, my hand raised to sleet and some my shoes doffed to oblivion, like the hermit in the song by the art bears himself inspired by the hermit carved in stone on the stylobate of the cathedral in Amiel. I have considered carving myself in stone to pass the time in the dingley Dell, but I do not have the proper tools. I suppose I could rob and Rob and Robert a pebble every day, persistently and carefully for years, but even then it would be very difficult to get the proper finish. Still, it's a project I might yet embark upon, for the days and nights are long in the dingley Dell. And once I have gathered my nuts and fruits of a morning, and made a note of the reading on the rain gauge hanging from a branch of the mighty laburnum, I must always be on my guard against the devil, who we know makes work for idle hands. The devil has appeared to me in many guises since I came to my hermitage in the dingley Dell. At first he took the form of a vaporous mist. This suggested to me that his powers were weak, and I laughed at him loudly waving my arms about to disperse him. But then he grew able to inhabit solid forms, albeit tiny ones, such as an ant, or a twig. Lately, things have entered a dangerous phase for the devil has entered the body of a squirrel and the dingli Dale is teeming with squirrels, shunning the company of my kind as I do, being a hermit. I have learned to commune with squirrels, but now I must shun them to or risk engaging with Beelzebub himself. Well, that's what happened. I might be forced to take refuge in the dingley Dell hotel. In the normal run of things of course, I avoid it. Sometimes while gathering my nuts and fruits, I come close to the hotel carpark and hide behind a shrub. I have seen the major Damo of the hotel striding purposefully across the carpark even making his way into the dingley Dell proper, where he stops and sits on a log and smokes a cigarette. This is disturbing, but I'm not so neurotic as to think he is in league with the devil. Even though squirrels do approach him tentatively hoping perhaps for a nut or two. But the major Domo is not a man for nuts. He just smokes a cigarette and occasionally taps out messages on my Blackberry. Not the kind of blackberry I would have for my supper. After some toasted fish, I should add. His is an electronic device which beeps from time to time while he smokes. It is most irritating, but I dare not rush out at him from behind my shrub and snatch the thing from his hands and stamp upon it until it is crushed to smithereens, which is what I would like to do. For if I did that, I would betray my presence in the dingley Dell and it would no longer be my hermitage. I would probably have to talk to the major Domo to explain myself. And I'm not sure I can remember how to speak in a way that's understood. Unless I'm speaking to a squirrel and until a devil shifts shape, I cannot even talk to the squirrels. What is the become of me here in the dingley Dell? I know. I shall make a note of the registration plates of the cars in the hotel car park and compare the numbers with the readings from the rain gauge to discover if there is any correlation that will pass the time and be more diverting than going Rob Rob Robert a pebble and eventually the devil will tire of being a squirrel and turn into something else. But he will never outwit me, for I am the hermit of the dingley Dell basta.

I'd like to read a quotation now from a very interesting book called curious things of the outside world last fire by Hargrave Jennings published in 1861. I can't remember whether I've actually read something from this book on the program before. But I certainly haven't read this. This bit, which I think you'll enjoy. Martin Luther Thomas relates the case of a monk who fainted when he beheld a rose and never quitted his cell. While that flower was blooming, or feeler, a less questionable authority, gives the account of the painter Vincent, who was seized with violent vertigo and swooned when there were roses in the room. Voltaire gives the history of an officer who was thrown into convulsions and lost his senses by having Pink's in his chamber, or feel it also relates to the instance of a lady of 46 years of age of a hail constitution, who could never be present when a decoction of linseed was preparing, being troubled in the course of a few minutes, with a general swelling of the face, followed by fainting, and a loss of the intellectual faculties, which symptoms continued for four and 20 hours. montane remarks on this subject, that there were men who dreaded an apple more than a cannonball. Zimmerman tells us of a lady who could not enjoy the feeling of silk and satin and shattered when she touched the velvety skin of a peach. Other ladies cannot bear the feel of further boil records the case of a man who experienced a natural appearance of honey. A young man invariably fainted when a servant swept his room. Hippocrates mentioned one Nick Kanwar who swooned whenever he heard a flute and Shakespeare has alluded to the strange effect of the bagpipe boil fell into a sin cope when he heard the splashing of water, scattered or turned pale on the site of water caresses. Erasmus experienced febrile symptoms when smelling fish, the Duke Depo swooned on beholding Leverett, although their hair did not produce the same effect. Tyco Bri fainted at the site of a fox, Henry's a third of France that have a cat and Marshall Tao bear down play at a pig. The horror that whole family's entertainer cheese is well known.

I'm sure you know some entire families who have a horror of trees and if you don't you get out more. And another thing I mentioned last week was the rebranding exercise, which was applied to the Seven Dwarves of Snow White's acquaintance. And it has by any measure been a PR triumph, because everyone is familiar with their names. What that was so with hamstrung pointy and downcast, a trio now largely forgotten, so much so that even the cleverest brainboxes would be hard pressed to say whether they were a music hall act, a set of cartoon strip characters, or if they occupied some other corner of popular culture. there is uncertainty to regarding the identity of the third member who is sometimes referred to as downcast and other times as mordant. references to the mess scattered here and there in the records of the past in biographies and memoirs are newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, letters, official and unofficial reports. And salvaged ephemeral but he Bob's, yet hamstrung, pointy and downcast somehow refuse to swim into focus. They remain impossible to pin down, each seeming fact contradicted, or even a raised by the next. Consider, as one example the nature of their living quarters, based on a glancing and none to clear bit of footnote or in a photocopy of a manuscript by pap stoep. Many people are of the view that hamstrung pointy and downcast inhabited a sweat log. At least point is said to have used the word lodge when filling in forms, and the three of them emitted copious amounts of sweat to the extent that they collected it in sealed jars, which they then tried to mark it as some sort of medicinal potion. So the details of that little enterprise are so disgusting, that we would best not dwell upon them. Yeah, elsewhere, gobbing the vileness of seaside resorts. It's suggested that hamstrung and pointy if not downcast, whose name is given here as Morden moved permanently in the sand and silt and build beneath a jetty and was semi amphibious to boot. The evidence for this appears to be a scribble in the margin of a police report prepared by legendary copper detective Captain karg pan. But whether the scribble is in his hand, or that of one of his brutish subordinates, is not made clear. Like so much else in the matter of hands. Strong pointy and downcast. We are left clutching haplessly at straws, straws that snap or a born away on a gust of fierce and southern wind. of necessity we have to read between the lines, and sometimes not just between them, but behind them, or as an angle to them. HP Lovecraft might have described as belonging to an abnormal geometry loads suddenly redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. When we do that, we may come no closer to gaining of proper conceptual grasp of the trio. But we can appreciate I think that there was a time when hamstrung, pointy and downcast were as famous as Joseph Stalin or Martin tapper or Xavi a to get and as culturally significant. Perhaps we will recall that passage in the memoirs of old halb, the coach and mentor of fictional athlete bob bennett tavole, where he writes I went out to the kiosk to buy a carton of high tar cigarette, and as I clattered along the street, it seemed to me the ground, the sky, the air by Christ, every atom in creation was somehow shouting out the names of that illustrious threesome, safe and snug in their sweat lodge, or under the jetty in sand and silt and build is chilling, I think that this sentence was expunged from the published version of the memoirs, for reasons never divulged to the hoi polloi.

Excuse me. It's the summer holidays. So those of you with children will need various projects to keep the tinies occupied. And here's one, there'll be others following in the in the next couple of weeks, I expect. Get your Pipi bag and cram it full of Kpop. Using a length of butcher string or old boot lace tie the Pipi bag tightly closed so that none of the Kpop will fall out. Now stick innumerable pins into it. And voila, you have a splendid homemade pin cushion. It may be that your interests do not run to needlework or embroidery, in which case you will not find much use for a pin cushion. So let me show you how easy it is to turn it into something far more exciting. Fashion a few pipe cleaners into the basic shape of a human body, arms and legs and torso. then poke this into your pin cushion which serves as the head. Depending on the size of your Pipi bag, the proportions will be all wrong, and it will look a bit like a three dimensional stick person with a huge bloated hydrocele phallic head. But don't worry about that. Think of it as a voodoo Dolly. The next thing you need to do is to force your mind into believing that the dalai is genuinely imbued with the spirit of a real person, just as Francis Galton convinced himself that Mr. Punch was a god. But bear in mind that the dalai has innumerable pins stuck in its head, which almost guarantees that the person you choose whether it's David Blunkett, for example, or gorby doll will shortly afterwards have their actual head attacked by a swarm of bees.

Two more quotes to end with. The first is from Pliny the Elder from his natural history. You may recall last week that we learned about Dobson's aborted attempt to rewrite plenty Anyway, here's the real plenty. From 77, roughly 7779 ad in his natural history, the small bones of poultry preserved in a hole in a wall, the medullary channel being left intact, will immediately cure toothache. They say, if the tooth is touched, or the gums scarified there with care being taken to throw away the bone the moment the operation is performed. A similar result is obtained by using ravens dung wrapped in wall and attached to the body, or else sparrows dung warm with water oil injected into the air on the side affected. This last remedy, however, is productive of an intolerable itching. for which reason it's considered a better plan to rub the part with the ashes of young sparrows burnt upon twigs mixed with vinegar for the purpose excuse me, and also almost 2000 1900 years or so later in 1906. In the introduction to the instruction of patar hotep and the instruction of Kagan the batter's comm g gun wrote as follows inspired spite of the fact that the ancient Egyptians enjoy rather more popularity than their contemporaries, it is evident that the books which they wrote a closed books to those who have not the glamour of vanished peoples, and the fascination of mighty cities now made desolate strong upon them. Yet in the heterogenous and pitiful flotsam that reluctant seas of wash to us piecemeal from a remote past, there are as will be shown later, many things which although proceeding from a culture and modes of thought, as far removed from our own as they may well be, are worth the reading. And I hope to have more pitiful flotsam from hooting yard for you next week. Meanwhile, don't forget to visit the website, buy some books, make a donation, subscribe or just, you know, read the stuff and get a little glow of something in your heart or something like that. I think I better shut up. Bye bye.
