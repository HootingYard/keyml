Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Half an hour of pros, the first two pieces of which today we'll be pleased to hear about the out of print pamphleteer Dobson. Dobson could be a very prescient man. Imagine for a moment, a world where the magazine racks in newsagent shops contain titles like nunc Dimittis and look code rotate and learn and the weekly cranium rather than pack and fluffy head and cat. It was like that once in the middle of the last century. And it was in such a world that Dobson woke up one morning, went downstairs and ate bloaters for breakfast, and polished his Montenegrin hunting boots, and walked out into the rain with a surprising sense of purpose. He had had one of his bright ideas, and he was going to act on it without delay. He did not pause by the illegal book shop, nor by the town list our library nor the lie don't have a pie shop nor the allotments, but strode onwards to a pond at the very edge of town, where a fledgling television program making unit had set up cameras to record a documentary about swans. A quaint black and white look at some swans near a pond was planned as a primetime series for later that year, and would prove to be the most popular show of the decade. It was that sort of world elbowing his way through a security cordon. Dobson identified the producer seized him by the collar and dragged him off to one side. I have an idea for a television series, he shouted at the pipe smoking cardigan wearing weakling who crumpled in all of the out of print pamphleteer. I suggest continue to Dobson that you immediately stop filming these confounded swarms, and instead take up my brilliant idea which is as follows. You gather together roughly a dozen well known persons, all of whom tend to be flibbertigibbet by nature, and you lock them in an attic for two months. You then film them being flibbertigibbet in an attic. The program would be called celebrity flibbertigibbet attic, and I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a hit a palpable hit. The scrawny television producer squirmed free from Dobson's importunate grasp, and thumped back through the march towards where his team was filming over 120 hours of swamp footage. He paused only to relight his pipe, which had gone out after a flick of Dobson spittle landed slap in the middle of the bowl. At this point several swarms, who had wandered away from their allotted places set upon Dobson whooping at him and pecking at his trousers and he fled. On his way home, he stopped in at the early morning skiffle club milk bar, and became obsessed with the rhythmic bashing of washboards and interest which utterly consumed him for several weeks, by the end of which time he had completely forgotten about his groundbreaking television concept. He could be as I said, a very prescient man, but he was far too easily distracted. And continuing on with Dobson immediately we have a piece entitled six lectures on fruit. No swans in this or celebrity flibbertigibbet Dobson's six lectures on fruit were among the most highly regarded of his works held in an esteem that the contemporary reader finds unfathomable. revisiting these pamphlets it swiftly becomes apparent that Dobson has no idea what he's talking about. The revised view of the lectures is put best by one upstart young Dobson scholar who dismisses them as bloviating and orotund.

Consider the first lecture on the putting a fruit into pies, in which Dobson challenges the accepted definitions of both fruit and pies, not to mention the usual meanings of the word of the verb to put. Some critics like to pretend that the essay is a precursor of what would become known as post modernism or Deacon instruction and in as much as it's clueless jibberish, they are correct. In his defense, the pamphleteer does not dress up his babble the needlessly complicated pseudo academic jargon. Indeed, his language is direct, even earthy and littered with harsh Anglo Saxon expletives. But he betrays the depths of almost unimaginable ignorance. The climax of the lecture is supposed to be a recipe for what Dobson calls a prune and the lemon pastry explosion. But the instructions are so big fogged by weightlessness, that to my knowledge, no one has ever succeeded in making it. The genesis of the lectures was an invitation to Dobson from the orchard persons of the port of tongues. Those of you familiar with the geography of this wretched seaside town will know that it's bounded on its eastern landward side by a terrific number of orchards. The orchard person's social club and community center was situated in a clearing between a pear orchard and a persimmon orchard, and the usual entertainment it hosted were nights of on par on par music and freakish dancing. Perhaps that is why Dobson chose to deliver his second lecture on the cutting of grapefruit into segments of equal size in the form of rhyming couplets, to the accompaniment of a glockenspiel. He was not a skilled blocking specialist, nor did he have much understanding of geometry as those orchard persons discovered who went home and tried to cut their grapefruit the Dobson way. For the third and fourth lectures, Dobson resorted to anecdote and personal reminiscence recounting a series of yams under the headings over plums I have ever eaten, where I was and what they tasted like, and how I built a coat hanger out of fig stones. audiences were dwindling By this time, and only three people turned up to listen to what was to become the most notorious of the lectures, the dialogue between a raspberry and a tangerine. Even those who are most severely critical of the series, are forced to admit that Dobson did a tremendous amount of research for this one. He was barely out of the reading room of the pointy town municipal library for weeks on end, poring over books on topics as diverse as fruit, Philately biochemistry, aerodynamics, the pendency Allah wars, tugboats, flamenco dancing, and the Diet of Worms. But he's claims to have penetrated the very essence of a raspberry and of a tangerine, a quite frankly ludicrous. marigold to told him so as they ate breakfast on a hopeless veranda on the morning before the lecture. Dobson's response was to weep great wracking sobs into his bowl of Special K. He spent all day making revisions to the text, some of which have a certain Jesuit ethical rigor, and by the time he arrived at the clearing between parent persimmon orchards, he was brimming with confidence. preposterous it may be but the dialogue between a raspberry and the tangerine retains to this day a kind of Magnificent declar maitri briault, lengthy extract from the lecture from the libretto of a concept album by prog rock Titans, gratuitous omal out. The published edition of six lectures on fruit contain only the text of the first five lectures. Some Dobson is to have argued that the sixth in the series never actually existed. The Dobson had some kind of brain spasm, and that all knowledge of fruit was wiped from his mind. Evie van boo did much to spread this story in a foolish conspiracy theory novel, but he overlooks the fact that the pamphleteer was never a man to let ignorance stop him expounding at length on any subject he turned his mind to. What in fact happened was that when Dobson arrived in the clearing on the final Thursday, he found the doors of the social club barred and bolted, and no one in sight.

Even the birds had fled from their purchase on the trees that fringed the clearing. Dobson took one look at the mighty iron padlock on the door, reached into his satchel took out the notes of his sixth and final lecture, some drivel about bananas or marmalade, and tore them into confetti, and cast them onto the winds. And then he trudged off into one of the orchids and shook a branch until pears and persimmons came tumbling to earth, and he sat on a tuffet and gorged himself On fruit until he was bloated and bloated he was on homewards along the line out of the orchard, body and brain with fruit bloated

kuliah mono maniac but I've realized that the next piece I'm going to read is also about Dobson the out of print pamphlet here, where Eagles dare is a 1968 film starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood and Mary your based on the 1967 novel by Alistair MacLean, who also wrote the screenplay. It's also the title of a late pamphlet by Dobson Dobson's where Eagles dare was written at the prompting of marigold to who hoped that by scribbling away at length, the pamphleteer could overcome his preposterous obsession with the film. Students of Dobson's dotage will recall that he took to wearing a snow suit and cobbled together a walkie talkie system out of paper cups and string. for weeks on end, his only communication with marigold too was to stretch the string to its full extent so that for example, he was in the pantry when marigold crew was in the front garden or vice versa, and to declaim. broadsword, Danny Boy broadsword to Danny Boy into his paper cup. Dobson's mania was given further fueled by the coincidental fact that for many years, marigold, choose party peace had been an exquisitely accurate impersonation of Michael Hordern. Her voice was of course somewhat higher pitch than that of the actor, but she used a Japanese funnel to lower it and CT is distracted mannerisms perfectly. As weeks turned to months and Dobson's foolishness showed no sign of abating. He had for example, taken to referring to their houses the Schloss Adler marigold true became desperate, she consulted a local bird counting person who arranged for a multitude of wrens to flock around the house, thinking to simulate the conditions in the tragedy of King Richard the third, containing his treacherous plot against his brother Clarence, the pitiful Murtha of his innocent nephews, his tyrannical use patient with the whole course of his detested life, and most deserving death. We're in quote, The world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where Eagles dare not perk, and of quote, this only serve to encourage Dobson and so at her wit's end marigold true reason that the writing of a pamphlet might be the answer. It was characteristic of Dobson that his many fads and enthusiasms spotted out once he had written about them, and so it proved once again but what do we make of his where Eagles dare today? It's impossible to say for not a single copy has ever been cracked down. Indeed, something could never existed in the first place, and is a mere shimira although a shimmer of a particularly dog sonian kidney. One small footnote, there is an amusing note in marigold chews diary from this period where she writes the greatest scape is showing at the local Excelsior. I have sent Dobson to a remote seaside resort for the duration of its run. One cannot be too careful

The tale is told of the volunteer brevet cadet, who in spite of his shocking weakness, was sent on a dangerous mission. He had to travel alone through a hostile environment. Think belching volcanic gases, creeping tendrils and suckers fears slobbering beasts with razor sharp fangs, turbulent rivers, turbulent skies, turbulent storms. On the fourth day, the volunteer brevet cadet arrived at a field station. By this time he was palyed fearful and all a whimper. The Field Station Commander tried to inject some vim into the puny little fellow. He sat him down with a canteen of hot Sumatran breakfast tea and gave him a good talking to explaining that brevet cadets whether or not they were volunteers were expected to be Dowty and tough and resolute to jump their jewels in determined fashion, sometimes while clenching a pipe between their teeth and to laugh with hilarity in the face of peril. The brevet cadet, sipped his tea you know we the way and tried unsuccessfully to stop whimpering. Eventually, the Field Station Commander issued him with a pith helmet, clapped him on the back and sent him off for the next stage of his mission. The Field Station Commander was a man of unparalleled experience in this hostile environment, and he was confident that the brevet cadet would be emboldened by wearing a pith helmet, and that his whimpers would soon be a thing of the past. It pained him. Then when six days later, he received a message by pneumatic funnel from the next field station along the line that the puny volunteer had tottered into the heart, sobbing and wailing and quivering and generally lacking in resolution, bravery and grit. The commander of the second field station, bid him lie in a hammock and cranked up a gramophone player, hoping to increase his gusto by having the brevet cadet listen to stirring tunes, played by the finest brass bands and dance orchestras. One recording in particular that was likely to do the trick was Enrico Pepin. jers version of harar boys let us march with sprightly tread through wild lands where we fear not the buffets of those who would cause us harm. After taking a nap and downing a canteen of hot Burmese lunchtime tea, the volunteer was sent off on the next part of his perilous mission in joined by the second field commander to fear no buffets. But buffets came soon for the brevet cadet, now headed into territory more dangerous still. Here were huge plants using poison, Earth tremors, the roaring and howling of unimaginably terrible monsters, magnetic anomalies, and many another sort of sight and sound and phenomenon that had the poor puny cadet pedaling in his pantaloons. By the time he reached the third Field Station, nine days later, he was feverish, shivering and shaking uncontrollably, half blind with terror, and calling out weekly for his mama. He slumped against the door of the field station hot and begged for death to end his misery. And then, out of the heart came not death, but heroic, adventurous, tiny Enid who had flown in on her biplane just minutes before she plucked the wheelie cadet up and shoved him into the heart, where she pulled for canteens of piping hot batavian Twilight tea down his gob wrenched off his standard issued dangerous mission footwear, and presented him with a pair of gumboots. Listen puny cadet. She said, not unkindly, you have volunteered for this dangerous mission, and you will succeed by wearing these gumboots you will be emboldened and one day you will return to a cue as a hero a credit to your troop let off you go. And so stirred was the bravest cadet by these words, and by the emboldened meant he felt as he slipped his feet into the gumboots that he strode off even into even more hideous terrain, brave and strong and wholly free of fear, no longer with even a trace of weakness about his puny frame,

and every word spoken by tiny Enid was true. For six years later, he came thundering back to HQ astride a huge Dry Nasir is a pipe clamp between his teeth and the drug to his jaw and the golden key to the secret fortress of the mysterious adepts of the hidden tower of the invisible goat deity tucked in his saddlebag, and they festooned him with flowers and blue upon crumpets and pinned medals upon him, and he was shipped Homewood in great luxury, and was famed for ever after as the no longer weedy volunteer brevet cadet.

I've been asked to say some further words about the golden key to the secret fortress of the mysterious adepts of the hidden tower of the invisible goat diety. The key which was referred to in that last piece emboldened in gumboots. It suggested that obtaining it and bringing it back to HQ was the object of the no longer weedy volunteer brevet cadets dangerous mission. Rather than babbling on about the key however, I think readers or listeners even would be better served if I said something about the invisible goat deity itself. This goat God was not only invisible, but more significantly, it was vagrant in the sense that it was forever wandering around hither and thither without any apparent purpose. It was for this reason that the adepts had constructed a tower in which to pin it. They let it out to go wandering on special ceremonial days, and we're able as adept to crack it aimless scurrying because the day it left a unique carbon footprint wherever it went, perhaps carbon footprint is the opposite phrase. The mark of a crew adapt was an acutely honed skill word of setting the goat Gods carbon hoof print, so few people had even the glimmer of an idea of what offsetting the carbon hoof print actually meant that there was only ever a handful of adapt, easily recognizable in their huge blue conical hats, waving their ones and weighed down by necklaces of bones and teeth and jewels and stones and dough. The adepts spent most of their time in their secret fortress, writing lengthy and learned texts about the deity. Careful never to reveal how they offset the goat God's carbon hoof print, they had two objectives. As their God was invisible and vagrant. They felt it necessary to compile a thorough account of its character, personality, likes and dislikes, temper cogitations diet sensibility and speech patterns or rather grunt patterns. Their second aim was to to convince the ignorant peasants who lived in the bailiwick of the fortress on the tower that the invisible goat was their Creator, and had ultimate power over their miserable lives. pebble heads best selling paperback jolt, is a fictionalized account of the exciting day when the goat outwitted the adepts and lock them in the tower, then scampered off to the secret fortress, and in the company of a number of other goats both visible and invisible, managed its way through their collected writings, leaving nothing but a clotted chewed up massive spittle soaked scrap paper. No one knows what became of the goat after that, for it resumed its vagrant ways invisible, and so ended its go to godly dominion, which had lasted for just six weeks in the year of straw long ago, but not so long ago was all whacked.

Now I'd like to tell you about systems. Specifically, I want to talk about my brother's system and my sister's system. They're two very different systems. My brother's system was manufactured by paste weakened company, an old family run firm, whereas my sister built her own. Paste weak systems are admired for the simple elegance of their design. On which still relies on a chain rather than a lever or push button like a modern system, the founder of the firm Alonzo paste wick, who cuz I sort of scaramouche figure was what is known as a chain system man in the trade. In contrast of the simplicity of the system itself, paced with chains tend to be rikako. My brother's systems chain for example, is a wonder of metalwork, knotty and swirling and embedded with floral motifs, at the end of which is a wooden handle carved in the former nyad the Greek freshwater nimeth. Neither chain nor handle is a paste with original for these made before 1911 and now much prized and highly expensive. What my brother has is a modern reproduction, made by paste Wiccan co themselves, and still fairly pricey when he bought the house in which the system looked like a porcelain Crusher. They had one of the postwar suspension bridge chains the company favored at that time. It had been ill treated by the previous occupants. God knows how and was buckled and rusting. My brother devised a foolish tale about the train having been used to weigh down a corpse thrown into a lake, then subsequently recovered, and even tried to sell a short story based upon his idea to Madcap potboilers magazine. The editor sensibly refused it and the manuscript ended up as fuel for a bonfire. I've never been entirely clear how my brother raised the money to buy the nyad reproduction, arrested and extraordinary four times in connection with the sausage factory affair. No charges were ever leveled against him, and so I suppose he must be innocent. He was also able to prove that the snapshots of him in a conspiratorial hovel with soapy bingle gloom were faked, which presumably means he had nothing to do with the pointy town killings. Anyway, however, he raised the cash, my brother was able to replace his train and handle within two years of moving in. He even threw a party to celebrate the occasion, which as far as I know, is the only time he's ever hosted a party certainly is the only one I've ever been invited to. I was astonished at all the celebrities who were there. I had no idea my brother had even heard of DeForest Kelley, Nikolaus Pevsner, or Olivia de Havilland let alone that he was on backslapping terms with them. Of course, we all have to trip into the bathroom at one point to admire the pastry reproduction, while my brother braid. That was the night of the squirrel sanctuary horror, so he had a perfect alibi. My sister wasn't at the party, though she had been invited. She had a good excuse having slipped a disc while doing the final digging for her homemade system. Hers is a huge tank with a cement floor and dirt walls coated in plaster. There is a lid of course to prevent mud creepy crawlies small creatures such as authors or weasels, or indeed her seven children from getting into the water. She poo poos paste week and all his works. The man was better scaramouche chain system man, she wrote in her last letter to me from her cell in the big grim prison advocate on the act, where she's on remand as the chief suspect in the truck tour guide dogs scandal. I have no idea whether she's innocent or guilty. But I promised her I'd keep an eye on her system. And that I shall

nearly the end of the show, but I think we just have time for this. I'll read it rather quickly. A week or two after the inaugural parade for hooting your website as long ago as December 2003. I received a plea in the post from a concerned reader. Dear Frank, my anonymous correspondent wrote, I've heard it said that Blodgett always maintained an alphabetical content in his duffel bag. Is this true? And if so, can you give an example drawn from a typical Blodgett day? Well, yes, Blodgett did always maintain an alphabetical content in his duffel bag. The 26th of March 1965 was for Blodgett a pretty unremarkable day, and this is what he had in his duffel bag. aniseed botsman diagrams, cake dust ectoplasm flippers, grease hinges in Canada. Bueller jam doughnuts kailyn linctus marmalade nothingness ornament prunes Queen as Morel does toilet water, ransom money, sandpaper terps ollege vinegar wax X ray spectacles, yeast and zinc blobs. So I hope you found that informative. That's the end of this week show and I'll be back with more very serious and earnest pros next week. Bye bye
