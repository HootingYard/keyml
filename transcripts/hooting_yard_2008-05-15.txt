Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Whenever I think about Dirk Bogarde with a moustache in a Vaporetto, I hear the dadri echo from Gustav Mahler's Fifth Symphony, such as the power of cinema. If you've seen Luchino Visconti his death in Venice 1971, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. I often find myself thinking about Doug Bogart with a mustache in a Vaporetto, probably more often than is normal. And I have absolutely no idea why. If I'm able to snap out of the thought within 30 seconds or so, all is well, but once I hit the half minute mark, I invariably break into great heaving sobs and have to dabit my eyes with an expensive handkerchief, or a rag, whichever comes readily to hand. I try to make sure there's always an expensive handkerchief in one of my pockets, or tucked into the waistband of my trousers, like a midget cummerbund. But if I'm going to mock out a pigsty say or to scrape grease off the wall of a drainage chute, I'm more likely to opt for a rag.

fishness has its attractions but it's ill advised in some circumstances. Duck bow guard was occasionally foppish early in his career, but by the time he sported that mustache, you know, Vaporetto, he'd become a sort of Euro thespian, a serious man of a kind I would like to see youngsters emulate today. No one has ever asked me how I would tackle the modern plague of feral inner city youth. If they did, I would recommend that young tearaway eyes grow mustaches and sit shattered in Vapp burritos. The dadri eto for Marla's fifth could be piped at them through loudspeakers or loaded onto their pods. If the government was willing to stump up the cash, it might even be possible to have orchestras sent into the more gruesome sinker states to play the dadri yeto live.

I recognize that many teenage girls are as violent and unruly as boys. But the stick on false moustache is a perennial favorite in joke shops and theatrical costume ease. So the resources are there. It just takes the political will to make it happen. Clearly that have to be a major increase in Vaporetto inputs, but a beneficial side effect would be the regeneration of our canals and estuaries. Speaking as one who has to haul a cart along winding country lanes, sweating like a pig. I would certainly welcome that. I use my expensive handkerchiefs to wipe the grime and perspiration off my neck as often as I dabbed the tears from my eyes when thinking about duck bioguard with a mustache in evapo Reto if truth be told, if the contents of my cart could be shoved onto a barge and go by canal, I would be a happy man. I am already like the later Dirk Bogarde a serious man. Happy and serious would be a fantastic combination. I live in hope

I'm very pleased to announce that the latest episode in the grizzled old fool series of multi platform cultural interventions has been released. grizzled old fool at the haberdashery sees the grizzled old fool, going to a haberdashery to buy buttons and cloth and pins. As usual, he's chewing a plug of tobacco and wearing his trademark battered old hat. He behaves ineptly in the haberdashery peddling in his trousers and overturning a display standard thread samples. In a particularly poignant moment. He is mistaken for Mark E. Smith of the fall, and prevailed upon to sing an extemporary version of city hobgoblins to the Haberdashers excited children. much attention is given to the purpose to which the grizzled old fool intends to put his purchases, buttons, cloth and pins are hardly the kinds of things we expect to see deployed by our hero, who were more used to seeing traipsing between his shack and his outdoor privvy shouting at the sky. He does plenty of shouting in the haberdashery at nobody in particular, and he also leaves a trail of drool upon the countertop. When the haberdasher eventually calls the police, the grizzled old fool is bundled onto the back of their cart and ferry to the riverside police station. crudely they shove him into the river, not realizing that he is, of course, amphibious, like unto a toad. Happily splashing about in the water. The grizzled old fool makes his way to the opposite of bank. He clambers ashore and pops into a chemist shop, where he buys some bandages, a bottle of mouthwash and the boiled head of a goat. This last is a prized medicament in the land on the other side of the river, where scrapings from it are used as an apparent tossing his purchases into a grease proof paper bag. The grizzled old fool waits for nightfall before plunging back into the river and returning to his own country. The police station is shattered and deserted, so he pauses to spit a goblet of flame onto the door before heading back towards the haberdashery under a gibbous moon. For Haberdashers, excited children are tucked up and fast asleep, but before gulping down their bedtime milk slops, they left some buttons and cloth and pins on a tray outside the Haberdashers cat flap. They also left a note in spidery handwriting for the grizzled old fool, but they wrote it in Latin, so to him it is merely mumbo jumbo. Nevertheless, he puts the note in his greaseproof paper bag together with the buttons and cloth and pins. Then he goes to the bus shelter to a white what will be a lovely, magnificent dorm. The colors for the dorm in the pictorial version of grizzled old fool at the haberdashery were created by a pigment test, whose previous contributions to the series included the garden of The Mentalist the dorbz of paint on the cuffs of a hub on de hoy, and the eerie Twilight in Penge. I have a great deal of respect for this pigment test, more than I have for the grizzled old fool himself, who's always seemed to me a rather one dimensional character. It's true that he's grizzled and old and foolish, which are three separate characteristics. But quite honestly, I think it's time he extended his repertoire. We've seen him go to the haberdashery and to the chemist shop, and in previous adventures, to the clinic, and the post office, and the library, and the community hub, and the football stadium and the pie shop and the orchestra pit and the Marina and the gigantic forbidding temple atop the craggy mountain, and the slums and the duck pond and the archipelago and the glue factory. But wherever he goes, he remains simply grizzled and old and foolish. Might I suggest that for his next appearance, he grows a mustache and sits shattered in evapo Reto while the strains of the adagietto from Marla's Fifth Symphony wash over us, and we burst into tears.

Have you ever been up the hills and far away? I have. I flew over the hills in a spy plane. And yes, before you ask, I was a spy. The plane flew very low over the hills. Not to avoid radar for this was before radar in the early days of aviation. The pilot flew very low over the hills, so I could spy on them more clearly. peering over the side of the plane, my gummy I fitted with a monocle, the better to aid my vision. my scarf flapped in the wind. Those were the days beyond the hills far away was the airfield where we came in to land. A person with a couple of flags guided us down. Inside the hangar, I made my report to control. I never did no controls name nor what he or she looked like. There was a desk in a dark corner of the hangar and control sat behind it engulfed in shadow smoking. I had to remove my monocle before sitting down. Then I spilled the beans. My report was simply a list of all the things I'd seen while flying low over the hills, farmyard. Bonds cows, duck ponds, charcoal burners, goats, Bracken, tongs, line pits, those sorts of things. I tried to arrange my list in alphabetical order for control off the top of my head. I had no idea what was going to be done with all this information. I wasn't even clear which side I was working for. But that's the nature of the trade. We creep about in shadows literally and metaphorically. While I was giving my report, the pilot went off to the canteen for a cup of tea. In the early days of aviation, every airfield had a canteen with a big tea earn. This may have been a Soviet influence. For these were also the early days of the Bolshevik Revolution. I did not go to this particular canteen myself. So I can't save the tier and resembled a Russian samovar. I could have asked the pilot later had the question occurred to me at the time. I don't know if airfield can teams still have big t urns. Because it's a world I have left behind my flying and my spying days along past. I consider myself lucky that I didn't end up shot in a ditch. That happened to quite a number of my fellow spies. Well, actually, I was shot while huddled in a ditch, but I was only wounded and they didn't finish me off whoever they were. They may have been the enemy, or they may have been on the same side as me. The ditch in which I was shot happened to be at the edge of the airfield where I landed after flying over the hills and far away. So it was a very, very long walk home with blood pouring out of my wounded head across the hills instead of our them. I passed by all those farmyards and bonds and cows and duck ponds and charcoal burners and goats and Bracken and tongs and line pits and whatever else on foot this time. at ground level, everything looked different. But that may have been because I no longer had my monocle, one of the bullets that smashed it to smithereens, and I left each smithereens where it lay scattered in the ditch. That's my story of going over the hills and far away, and I returned to tell it not everyone does.

Today is the 100th anniversary of the great in blockchain moment. There were countless other in blockchain events throughout our history. By the way we commemorate today was of a blotchy magnitude well above those other embellishments. It all started in a commercial laundry on pudding Boulevard. A man named Pim, who may or may not have been related to the late Francis Pim, Foreign Secretary from 1982 to 1983. Was bundling some towels into a basket when he noticed that one of the towels had been subjected to in blockchain meant a man of piercing eyesight. A bit like Ray may land in the man with X ray eyes 1963 but obviously not quite as piercing as that pin was able to at a glance to divine the cause of the enlargement, and it sent him into a panic. He scampered up the staircase from the laundry to street level and ran the length of putting Boulevard waving the unblocked towel in the air. Thus, microscopic blotchy bits were released into the atmosphere, invisible, but nonetheless blotchy. The authorities acted with admirable speed. Pim was carted off to a mysterious Institute hidden behind trees in the countryside, the sort of place that would later become familiar to viewers of the 1960s television series The Avengers. He was placed in isolation and fitted with a metal helmet wire that bleeping consoles. The blocked tower was torn from his grasp and sent to another mysterious Institute in the countryside, also hidden behind trees to be analyzed by trained in blockchain analysis analysts. Meanwhile, putting Boulevard was cordoned off with what at the time was an entirely new cordoning technique. A controlled explosion destroyed the laundry and its neighboring buildings, and the rubble was taken away by over 50 horse drawn carts and tossed down a pit. It was not a bottomless pit, like the bottomless Viper pit of God. But the nearest thing to a bottomless pit that could be identified at short notice. When the last bit of rubble was thrown down it, the pit opening was covered with layers of cement, over which a rich loamy soil was scattered, and lupins and primroses were planted there. A similar operation was carried out on the site of the laundry, except that hollyhocks and hyacinths were planted instead of lupins, and primroses. There were compelling reasons for this. Before the day was out, big pumps were moved into position on either end of putting Boulevard and the air was sucked into them, D blocked and pumped back out. Thousands of starlings were lured to flock over the laundry site and kept there by a magnetic barrier. They were monitored by a team of top ornithologist in a lead line cabin just beyond the boulevard around which a flower bed was dug and planted with geraniums and Wisteria at night for volunteers from Pang Hill orphanage was sent to scurry through the cordoned off area, and as soon as they emerged was tested for in blocked in a hastily rigged up lab, the floors of which was strewn with lilies and petunias. As we know none of this hectic activity succeeded in stopping the in blockman not only with the starlings and orphans and top ornithologist in blocked so too with a gardeners who planted the lupins and primroses and hollyhocks, and highest since in geraniums, and Wisteria and those who strew the lilies and petunias. Soon everything was in blocked, and I mean, absolutely everything, even the stars in their heavens, the outer planet, the gas giants, all succumbed to what it rightly called the grating blocks. And exactly one year later, on the 15th of may 1909, the actor James Mason was born in Huddersfield. Some see this as a coincidence, coincidence, but those of us who have studied such things, see deeper patterns, patterns, not unlike the embroidered curlicues on the towel that Pim waved as he dashed frantically down pudding Boulevard, and let loose the great enlargement 100 years ago today

before winning fame, or perhaps the word is notoriety, as the coach of fictional athletes Bob in it to evolve the train smoking, Misery guts, we know and love, old hallowed that a purposeless and indigent existence. The familiar image of him in that raincoat, grim and windswept and coughing up Qatar, standing at the side of a running track, spurring his fictional protege onto ever greater sprinting. triumphs had not yet been been through television screens across the globe, back in the days when only a cluster of hovels stood on the site that would one day become the old halb Stadium of sporting triumph and prowess. Excuse me, in his best selling paperback, old halabi and Petula Clark, are they the same person, pebble head posits the theory that the possibly East European coach and the English songstress as the same person. He points to the well documented fact that both as children sang in the entrance hall of Benton's department store in Kingston upon Thames, in exchange for a tin of toffee and a gold wristwatch. In addition, like Petula Clark, old Halo released a CD entitled The essential 20 unforgettable hits. This is where his argument fails to convince for where the age pop divas album contains songs and was a chart hit in Belgium. Old halab cd consisted of a recording of him eating his breakfast and grumbling about his mouth eaten raincoat and was an international rather than merely a local success. pebble had toggle is thoroughly demolished Of course, if we consider that for the first 52 years of his life, old halibut did little except refill bird feeders in the grounds of a home for the deranged a job for which he was paid with a daily bowl of gruel and slops. His parents were fabulously wealthy, and lived the life of Riley in a big forbidding castle, but their son lacked ambition, and they disowned him when at the age of nine, he rejected their birthday gift of a booster pack the elixir of life a modeling contract with L'Oreal, and a populated planet in a far distant galaxy to treat us is placing no one not even pebble head knows what happened to transform the doll witted bird feeder maintenance man into an athletic coach of legend. Perhaps a clue lies in his change of diet. Shortly after old Howard's 50th birthday, the management of the derangement home was restructured following a report from consultants price Watergate Cooper's Freeman hardy Willis, as part of their recommendations, old help stopped eating grueling slops and was in steed instead fed on whelks and barnacles. The evidence is not conclusive, but future biographers would be stupid to ignore it. And that's all I have to say about all the hell up today.

I'm going to probably burst into tears in a minute after listening to be a dadri at over Marla's Fifth Symphony. But before I do, and to end the show, here's an outdoor game for all the family after singing lustily at the Sunday church service, and having a little chat with the vicar on the church that you should repair to a patch of waste ground, taking with you a couple of battered iron pails, an unopened packet of processed cheese triangles, and some strips of bark from a pumpkin tree. Each family member should Donna read balaklava. Apart from the tiniest one who goes bareheaded one side of the patch of waste ground is designated Hazel Blears, the opposite side is consecrated to David Blunkett. The objective of the game is to get from Blears to Blunkett as directly as possible cleanly and without undue dithering. If the patch of waste ground is assailed by inclement weather, for instance, howling Gale a teeming downpour or thunder and lightning, the family may be accompanied by beetle brown ergens from beyond the railway tracks, use counters and a tally stick to keep score. And that's all from hooting your first week. So we'll leave you with this week's special music. And you can think about Doug Bogart with a mustache in a Vaporetto. Bye bye
