I got into the studio a bit too late to discover what that was I was listening to but it was fantastic. I think this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. like Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet, I am beautiful and clean, and so very, very young. Well, that's not exactly the case, unprepossessing, finally grubby and middle aged. But then Tony Hadley is no spring chicken either, if not quite as old as me. But all else being equal, and not withstanding brute reality, and both having my cake and eating it. I think I can justly claim to have beauty and cleanliness and use in comparison with certain others. A 100 year old Toad sitting in a bog, for example, put me next to that Toad on a date, so I remain unsullied by bog filth. And I think you would have to agree that if one of us is beautiful and clean and so very, very young, it's certainly not the centenarian toad. We will not invite Tony Hadley into the lineup. Todd done feature largely in the Spandau Ballet story, indeed, they do not feature at all. I have read the literature, all of it repeatedly, far beyond what is reasonable. And I can tell you, that there is not a toad to be found anywhere, not in the spans Harbinger's of pop norine Ooh, this matches true. Nor in the Spandau Ballet pop up picture book, not nor in any of the several other several dozen volumes, under which my bookshelf creaks. This is, I think, a great pity. Mark would would be explained where we tell them that the Kemp brothers or Tony Hadley himself kept as a child, a pet toad. I know there were a couple of other spans, but nobody remembers who they were, or cares other than their immediate families. asked me to explain what precisely would be explained. And I will make a fastidious gesture with my hands and snot and arrange my features into a withering look. A look that withers. Did Dougie withers ever listen to say, chant? Number one. It's one of the greatest regrets of my life that I did not grab the opportunity to ask her this question before she died a couple of years ago at the age of 94. Not that I had the opportunity. I never met googie withers. But I could have ferreted about for an email address or contact details and put my query to her. I feel sure Dougie would have replied. Of course, I have other regrets many Oh, many. And in all honesty, it's probably not true to say that the withers child number one regret is among the most heart wrenching of them. Not really. When I said when I said it was I suppose. No, no, I you say I've just got that. I've read that wrong. I'll begin the entire paragraph again. Of course, I have other regrets many or many. And in all honesty, it's probably not true to say that the winners can't number one regret is among the most heart wrenching of them. Not really. When I said it was, I suppose I was just trying to lend myself as it's a common failing, but I shouldn't make excuses. I know that now. And I know it because I've spent untold hours listening at top volume to the point where the neighbors complained to the police to the entire Spandau Ballet discography including outtakes and demos on a loop while gazing at large High Definition hyper realistic pictures of Toad with a magnifying glass. You should try it sometime. If there's a better way of clearing one's head of cobwebs and I don't know what is.

I'm not sure how one does a segue from Spandau Ballet to the French writer genre scene. So I won't bother trying. Racine said among other things, that one definition of a just war was when a king's puissance is ruined in the eyes of strangers. And I don't know how many listeners are teachers in what what used to be called schools, but now, self esteem and diversity awareness hubs. But, if any, if any of you are teachers, you may wish to teach that to your tinies. And in order to help you I've devised a play in to act called the tragedy of King Alfonso. Now there are three characters in this play that the king, who I will do in a deep voice, so you know, it's the king and the Chamberlain, and in a separate scene, the under Chamberlain, and I'll do them in a sort of high pitched voice, so you're able to tell who's who. So this is the tragedy of King Alfonso, in two act two scenes, and the cast is the king Chamberlain, and the under Chamberlain. seen one, the king's chamber, the king is seated in effulgent glory on his throne, the light pours out of him. Enter circly off guard, the Kings Chamberlain. May I be ushered into your dazzling presence? Oh, mighty king. Yes, yes. cobbins are clear off guard, execute the necessary falling and scraping prostrate yourself in the muck. Then hoist yourself to your feet and come clanking forward, but not too close. So clay off guard does as he is commanded. I bring grave news from the frontier saya. Really? What have you been doing galumphing around the frontier? When your duties lie here in the chamber? I thought I would get a bit of fresh air. Oh Lord of Light. Did you indeed Are you suggesting that the chamber is a fog of style air and mixed with noise some pongs. Now for a moment, Sire. Truly, it is bliss to breathe the nearest atom of air in the vicinity of your regal presence. And rest assured that all the while I was galavanting I was in constant contact with the under Chamberlain via my cordless metal Tapping Machine ready to rock rock rock to your side should my services be required? Now you have come rock rock rushing. So what is a foot? As I said saya grave news, grave news indeed, you know that those who dwell beyond the frontier are by definition strangers. But of course you do you have a king and therefore on this event, be that as it may, while I was out and about mincing around the frontier lands, I had the opportunity to study the eyes of the strangers I carried with me as I always do, and Oculus scope crafted for me by the court wizard the man OLG Oleg is indeed a great servant of the crown and the maker of many about welding in bewildering instrument. Go on. It pains me to say it saya but when I peered through Olds Oculus scope into the eyes of the strangers, I was big grown to vision reflected back at me of your pre songs. Ah, my pre songs, how I treasure it, you know, so clear off guard that few kings in all history have had prisons as priests own as mine. Indeed, your magnificence but the pre songs I saw in the eyes of those strangers was really ruined, quite, quite really bloody hell Really? I am afraid so cya. You realize what this means so clearly off guard war, it means war. I am well aware of that cya.

You must immediately prepare my army and my navy and my Air Force and my special forces and my Black Ops unit for battle. I have already taken the liberty of doing just that sire. They are fully provisioned and victual and marching or sailing or ballooning off to the frontier to do battle with your foes. Excellent. So clay off guard. I will pin a medal on your chest in recognition of your brios but not before you have flown to the United Nations headquarters to present our case to the Security Council. I wish to get their blessing that this is a just war in the terms laid down by the great French writer Racine. If I might be so bold, oh majestic one. Why bother with those gunked up bureaucrats and paper pushers for the very simple reason so clear off guard that once I have prosecuted this war and defeated the enemy and my puissante is once again restored to fantastic. I do not wish to be hunted wherever I go by gaggles of unruly placard waving rankers protesting that it was an unjust or illegal war as happened with Tony Blair. Of course I I ought to have thought of that and got Security Council clearance already. Yes, so clear off guard you should. Perhaps I may not give you a medal after all, but instead have your head lopped off and stuck upon a spike. Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, I was only joking. Now Off you go to the United Nations. At once saya. Exit Chamberlain seem to the king's chamber. The king is seated in a folder in the glory on his throne. The light pours out of him. And to saponified the Kings under Chamberlain. May I be ushered into your dazzling presence? Oh mighty king. Yes, Yes, come in support if Argh. Execute the necessary folding and scraping prostrate yourself in the muck. Then hoist yourself to your feet and come clanking forward but not too close. So potty Faraj does as he is commanded. I bring grave news from the United Nations, Sire. What now? Your Chamberlain circling off guard was mistaken for the diplomat Lester Townsend, and stabbed in the back by a knife hole with expert dexterity by a grim agent in the pay of Villa Philip Van Damme played by James Mason saya Crikey What does this mean for my pre salt? I theories it's really in your thousands, quite quite really. Like both sob bat swooped down from the rafters and darkness falls curtain.

It was a stark and do me night. The rain fell in Torrance, except for the occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the street, for it is in pointy town that are seen lies, rattling along the house tops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness. by the light of one such scanty flame, had we a view of the scene, we might have spotted, prancing along the windswept street muffled in a stylish Pete van de Groot, great code that that Titan among cultural theorists, john Luke get slung around his shoulder was this actual and in the sexual was a copy hot off the press of his latest book. Did I say book? It was not a word get used. He called it a text or a discourse of course. On this Stark and do me night, he was on his way through the gusty streets of pointy town to read selections from his text or discourse to a tavern full of intoxicated intellectuals. They were intoxicated both buy booze and buy ideas, and nobody had better ideas than john Luke get. So the taverns, hubbub was still, and there was an expectant posh as the cultural theorist came crashing through the door. without removing his stylish great coat, he crossed to the low stage where a lectern had been placed. Next to the lectern was a table on which stood a small glass containing a spirited flicker of vivid hue get Swigged it took his text or discourse out of the satchel, opened it on the lectern and began to declaim. for half an hour or so, everything went tickety boo, get recited his clogged impenetrable prose and the intellectuals farrowed their brows, nodded sagely and tugged at their goatees. But then the cultural theorists said and so in what we might call the hellix, of disengagement, we interrogate notions of structure, and the structure, this structure, Miss structure and structure, by way of an investigation, doubly incoherent, both formal and informal, of the punctum have results. from somewhere in the audience. There was a titter, which turned to a chortle, and very soon became a gulf war. It was followed by a Heckle couched in language so unseemly, it's not fit for family listening. JOHN Luke get was stopped in his tracks. I beg your pardon, he shouted. You heard what I said, replied the heckler. How dare you impugn my results? cried get. But it was as if the occasional violent gust of wind which swept up the streets of pointy town had come blowing into the tavern, as if the torrent of rain on this stock and do me Knight had come flooding in. In the two miles. The cultural theorists response proved no defense. He was on done. I know that there are many hooting our listeners, discussion groups, and which you all meet together shortly after the show to discuss the content. And here are some questions or sorry, not really questions, discussion points for your hooting yard discussion group. What is what is adjust course of action, if as a cultural theoretician Once jouissance is impugned? list the personality defects of the kind of barbarian who would impugn those results of a thicker as Titanic as john Luke get. using scissors and cardboard, make a paper Dolly dressed in a Pete van de Groot, great code. Which Tavern in pointy town do you think would be so irresponsible as to allow entry to a barbarian so culturally deprived that they would Heckle john Luke get? Do you think the scanty flame from the lamps that struggle against the darkness is symbolic of john Luke get resource saga niveau de bloomin Xin.

So there you had two pieces, one about pre sauce, and the other one about rissoles. The second one was inspired by the hooting yard, reader, and listener banished to a pompous land who's been banished all the way from Yorkshire to Virginia. And so many thanks to him for inspiring that. Now when I saw our adverts For the imminent cinema release of mud, I was bitterly disappointed to learn that it's a brand new film. I'd hoped it was a revival of the original mud. That classic film done, directed by wild eyed auteur Horst gak gak, of course, invented film done, and was its greatest practitioner. Unlike Film Noir, the archetype of film done is shot entirely in shades of done. It was Horst ghacks peculiar genius to recognize that there could be no better subject matter for filming done than mud. Thus, in mud 1937 and its sequel, further mud 1957. The camera gazes unflinchingly at patches of mud, holy done in color, without distracting the viewer with pole pruners, such as characters and plot and car chases, and big loud fiery explosions. mob is a gripping experience, wrote the film critic gervaise cravat in the October 1937 issue of cravats film Digest magazine. I for one will never look at mud in the same way ever again. He returned to the subject and the following month issue and I quote, last month, I wrote that having seen Horst ghacks mud, I would never look at mud in the same way ever again. It is with a certain humility then, if not as a self a basement that I must admit, I have indeed been looking at mud in the same old way as I always did. The very the very next day after watching mud, I was taking a stroll in assorted rustic backwater, when I came upon an extensive stretch of mud down in hue, and the thought popped into my head. Gosh, what a lot of mud, just like all the other mud I've ever seen in my three school years on earth. And I prom storm towards the viaduct and the author sanctuary, dismissing the mud from my mind. Only when I got home several hours later, and was making a cup of tea preparatory to putting my feet up and whistling some dance band tunes did I realize that I had looked at the mob in the old way, as if I had never seen Horst ghacks film. This was highly disconcerting, so much so that I tightened the cravat around my neck, forgot about the cup of tea, and immediately wrote a maiya culpa to gak, confessing that this film, but not, after all have the effect on me I thought it had had, but this was almost certainly my fault rather than his. Knowing that I'm questioning worship is the only proper approach to the great auteur. I added that I would atone for my Philistine ism by returning to the extensive stretch of mud done in hue in the sordid, rustic backwater, and mold from it, a done huge mud effigy of horse gak himself, double life size, before which I would prostrate myself several times a day in between watching repeat screenings of mud. This I have done every day since. And boy oh boy, let me tell you film goers I am like unto a man transformed.

The pounding of those infernal drums began shortly before dawn. I could hear them in the distance from far across the wild and data but to top pooter it was not a regular rhythmic pounding, but a drummed in more disturbing a clattering cacophony of bangs and rattles and thumps and booms, as if 1000 Chris Cutler's were improvising simultaneously in the folding camp caught next to mine, Carruthers stirred My God. He said, What is it Your countenance is ghastly, and the blood has drained from your face, which is twitching horribly like her but lob in the cuso films. It's the pounding of those infernal drums. Carruthers, I replied, can you not hear them? Bit of a problem with the old hearing Actually, he said, since that savage framed his blowpipe directly at my eardrum the other day. I had forgotten the incident. I had forgotten much of what occurred on our journey to the edge of the top pooter. Sometimes it's easier to forget. I stepped out of the tent with my pipe and took a deep draw on the filthy kirghiz scrag tobacco. The sun was rising now over the top pooter and the den of the drums grew louder and more ominous. Carruthers joined me lit his own pipe, and muttered something about eggs. After breakfast, sitting in our folding camp chairs, smoking our pipes, we gaze to Dally across the wild and desolate tar pooter. Every so often. The bleak expanse of nothingness was broken by us whooping bird, or distant scurrying Gazelle. The drumming continued without cease steadily increasing in volume, though not yet within our sight. Can you hear it yet? That infernal pounding? I asked. Yes, finally in my good ear, said Carruthers. His face too, was now twitching horribly. Soon enough, whoever is making that god awful racket will appear on the horizon. I said, We must devise a plan. Corrado spread our mat out on the folding camp table. With pondered our position on the edge of the top pooter with the big frightening river behind us to hide in our tent would be unmanly. But our folding camp rocket launcher was out of commission having been gnawed to ruin by an army of ferocious biting. And what if we covered ourselves in vividly colored dyes and posed as savage Gods suggested Carruthers, we might strike terror into them, and they would turn tail and scamper back to wherever they came from. But who are they? I said, we do not yet know with whom we are dealing. fairpoint said Carruthers relighting his pipe which had gone out I set up the folding camp sundial to ascertain the time. It was nearly midday, there was still no sign of the infernal dramas, yet the noise they were making was now definitely more eggs, said Carruthers. We wolfed down our lunch. Suddenly, on the far Horizon, we could see them far from being 1000 they were just three in number. How in the name of all that is holy, did they? Did they create such a tremendous and terrifying did two against three characters and I looked at each other, jotted our drawers and then unspoken compact agreed that our chances were better than good. Let's wait until we see the whites of their eyes, I said. And so we sat awaiting the drummer's as they slowly approached across the wild and deselect the top Buta to muffle the day and I stuffed cotton wool into my ears, and Carruthers plugged his good ear with a half sucked boiled sweet. We smoked our pipes. Last, shortly before dusk descended upon the top pooter we saw the whites of six eyes. I stood up and shouted, halt, I cried, step no further Oh, you will have to answer to the might of the Empire and the fury of the queen. Now seek your infernal drumming and tell me who you are, and what is your business. And then I learned and Carruthers learned that we had found the urbane Blodgett electronic percussion trio, long thought lost, having vanished somewhere in the vast a desolate top Buta 20 years before. And that's the end of the show for this week.
