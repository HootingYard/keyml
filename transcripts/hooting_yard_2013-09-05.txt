Hello, this is Frank key on resonance 104, point four FM or resonance fm.com. And this is hooting out on the air back for a new series. Or it may even be the same series that's been going on since 2004. Which means that in about six or seven months time, we're coming up to our 10th anniversary on air, which is pretty exciting. Really, maybe I should have a fundraiser and you can all send me some money or be a good idea. You can do that. Anyway, who knows. So do that now. Go to the hooting yard website, there's a little PayPal button and you just hit it and put it work out how much money you have in the bank. Take off, subtract, gotta know the few 50 pay or Sofia living expenses, and then send the rest to me. And a few experiences in life are as rewarding as being part of a mob and of all mobs. The buying mode is the best, particularly at nightfall on the outskirts of the village, holding aloft flaming torches and pitchforks surrounding the hovel of a wick or an oddball, forcing them to choose between fleeing or being burned. As a veteran of several such buying mobs, I find that exasperating that the witch or the oddball so often elicit sympathy. If one were to give credence to the witterings of the damn pen song, the do gooders and the chattering classes around their sophisticated dinner party tables. One might think that there's something wrong with brandishing a burning tare torch and baying for the blood of a social misfit. What planet do these people live on? If you're going to be an oddball, a mild eccentric or awake, then you have to take the consequences and the consequences rightly in my view, that me and my me and many many like me, simple credulous peasants, though we may be inarticulate and ignorant, will gather in the village Tavern and grab our pitchforks and torches and March, as dusk descend towards your shabby, insalubrious hovel buying. You may then choose to stay put and burn, or make an attempt to flee, bearing in mind that you may not succeed, given that we will chase you and overpower you and tear you limb from limb and Chuck what's left of view into a deck with a stake driven through your heart, that is simply the way of the world or in contemporary jargon, social cohesion. There is much talk of the so called madness of crowds, as if in allying oneself with one's fellows in a baying mob, one somehow loses a reason. Let's not forget that it's the witch or the oddball who is the enemy of reason, sitting in their hovel with their toads and newts and books, plotting dark and devilish deeds, give them free rein, and who knows what foul world they would have us inhabit better by far that they'd be stricken with terror at the site of our pitchforks and our flaming torches at the sound of our blood curdling buying. So, come and join us. We meet in the village tavern, bring your Pitchfork and your torch be part of the mob. It's an experience you won't forget.

One of the things that I've been doing throughout August has been I've been leaping out of bed, cutting two or three brisk boswellia and capers around the room before six o'clock in the morning, and this is so that I can tune in too, is it I'm not sure it's allowed to mention other radio stations on resonance. But apparently the BBC have one called radio four, which I accidentally have been tuning into. Because every morning, five to six or two minutes to six, they have the tweet of the day, which for the owner, theologically minded is a stupendous program, which has basically a bird song, and someone gesturing on about it. But as a as a consequence of wanting to listen to this, I end up listening to farming today, which is a very mysterious program on radio for involving lots of Modi farmers, but you often get great pieces of rustic wisdom. And one day, someone spoke of towers of trees. I'm not sure whether these resemble the towers of trebizond or Leonard Cohen's tower of song, but apparently there are towers of trees. And then another day, I heard the very interesting comment. I see the chicken. Good thing happens. So apparently, if you see a chicken, a good thing will happen. There's like red sky at night Shepherd to the light and all that interesting that I think possibly remember, she said, nothing happens.

Doe, a deer, a female deer, a deer one made out of dough. This was the bold conception of his fan, the eerie middle European Baker, whose pastry shop was hidden down insalubrious alleyway in an insalubrious provincial town at the foot of a huge important mountain range. You will find it on most maps. The gu breus insanitary and topped by a pudding base and haircut is Tran was beset by constant pangs. He longed for companionship. Alas. He was a stranger to that paradise of which the brothers Johnson sang the land of ladies. Though there were many women among his customers, they all hurried away as soon as they brought their baked goods, alarmed and distressed by his fans unbecoming personal appearance, his filthy manners and his lack of calm. So it was that he decided to make his longed for dearest, out of dough. ignorant of women he chose as his model a nun, specifically Maria in the sound of music, played by Julie Andrews. Having prepared sufficient dough for a life size none he needed and needed and molded into shape. When he was done, he placed it in a reclining position on the sofa in the back room of his pastry shop. And so for a while his evenings were happy, happier than they had ever been. He would sit at one end of the sofa, his hand, patting his dough companion gently, and he would talk to it or sit in contented silence. He no longer felt alone, and Maria was unabashed by his Magoo, breus and insanitary person did not look askance at his pudding basin haircut and tolerated his filthy manners. But as time grew dissatisfied, his pangs returned, more intense than ever, for he wished that his dough deer would do more than merely sprawl on the sofa. How much dearer she would be, if she were a true companion, one who laughed and sang and helped out with the baking of pastries. If only she could be imbued Frankenstein fashion with the spark of life. And then one day into the pastry shop, came a mysterious wizard, the type of fellow swiped in a black cape and wearing a pointy hat. He made purchase of some Middle European pastry delicacies, but before he switched his cape and strode away, his fan dared to ask him if by any chance he knew of spells to bring to life, none bite out of dough. I do indeed, said the wizard. bargain was struck, and its trend ushered the mysterious fellow into the back room. He stood over the dough Nan on the sofa, slowly waving his arms in strangely significant passing movements and babbling gibberish is fine looked on Gaga lied, which made his appearance even more unbecoming the noodle. When he was finished, the wizard the man turned to his fan, and told him that the final stage of the spell, the part that would bring his dough dear to life, was to bake the dough in a preheated oven on 22 degrees centigrade 200 degrees centigrade for fan assisted ovens, or gas Mach seven for 40 minutes. And then he swept out of the back room, swishing his black cape out of the front door and into the interlibrary has alleyway in the insalubrious provincial town in the shadow of an important mountain range, and his van never saw him again. barely able to contain his excitement. The airy Baker picked up his dough deer from the sofa and cradled her in his arms. Then shafter into the oven, which was already pre heated with all the baking the baker did. For the next 14 minutes is fine sat gazing at the hands of his middle European cuckoo clock tick talking through the time with agonizing slowness. At last, the baking time elapsed, but just as his fan was about to open the oven, the door swung open from inside.

Of course, his dough deer was alive out she would step into his arms. But in the baking, the transformation was greater than his fan could have imagined. It was not a living dough Julie Andrews that emerged from the oven. It was a living pastry, Christopher Plummer, as it lumbered towards this fan, it plucked from nowhere a guitar and began to sing a legal advice. The baker fell back upon his sofa, stricken with horror. I found him there. The next morning, is unbecoming features twisted in an awful Rictus of the pastry crust of a plumber. There was no sign, though some signs that on clear, bright days, when the air is still, he can be heard singing in the mountains that loom over the insalubrious, provincial middle European town.

So when I wasn't listening to farming today and writing about Doug, another thing I did was I read the neighbors, which is a 1967 novel by George seminal. And I'm very glad I did. Because there was a good there was a little bit in this in this book. The protagonist is a Parisien travel agent. And at one point in the book, he says to his subordinate, miss your clinch? Would you come here for a moment? I think we recently received a letter from Bill hat to warn our Kenya correspondent. Tragically, this is the only mention of Bill hat worn in the novel. And indeed in all World Literature. We learn nothing, nothing whatsoever about him, not even the contents of that letter, which Monsieur clinch has already filed. Surely having invented a character with such a resounding name, one way We must presume your seminar considered typically Anglo Saxon, the author of bashed out a series of novels about him and his doings in Kenya. Clearly it must fall to me to rescue Mr. Hat worn from obscurity and to write all those exciting adventures myself. First up, I suppose we'll have to rebuild hat warned Kenya correspondent to introduce him to our readers. That next I think I'll take inspiration from a poster I saw for a new blockbuster multiplex piece of cinematic twaddle. And right bill hat worn and the foolish people of the future may indeed, penna spin off series about the foolish people of the future, in which they dash about in the future, doing futuristic things with futuristic weaponry while dressed in futuristic Cavalier uniforms.

Anyway, I did a bit of research on bill hat worn Kenya correspondent and found two letters that he wrote from the interbeing gathered in the collected correspondents of Kenya correspondent bill happ one. Here they are. The undated, unsigned and we don't know who wrote them two odd letters. Meet me at the fireworks factory, I'll be wearing red, you were in your shoes, and may at the end of my tether, speak to me 14 words. You can make them up. I will listen, but I won't swim in your Muddy Waters. Truth or grit or something foreign to my senses. You would better see me right read my expenses. I paid through the nose, and it hurt me much. But where I goes, is such and such. And the second letter is as follows. I want my art to be in cars, or somewhere lacking proper food. You know, this sort of place. I mean, one book contains my art and crap. I sit and sweat in sorted bars, or on a stack of broken wood. I'm dumb, barbaric. I am keen. My art my life. My life, my trap. You always make me very sick. It's not your lips. It's not your hair. I spat out the cake you bought for me. These are the boys. These are the girls. This is the torch. This is the stick. This is the foliage and this is the chair. This is the lumberjack hacking a tree. This is the worst of all possible worlds. My rake your spade, his are vegetations we hop and stammer by ourselves. I want to share the flu. I've caught your raincoats the color of the window sill. I'm cross or am I doing the station's All I hear is the Clank of bells on so tall and you're horribly short. You're unspeakable. My name is Bill.

Frank Key  19:35
So actually, those weren't really letters by Bill hat worn what they were were verses written by me over 30 years ago. And it occurred to me just now while I was reading them, that that may be the first time I've read them in 30 years. And the only time I wonder I did once perform as Frank key the poet in a Norwich nightclub. I was supporting serious drinking the Norwich band. And what a memorable evening that was in my life. It was my soul ever appearances Frankie, the poet 1982 I think it was. And I've probably read both of those pieces and I haven't read them since. So if you were there, drop me a line. And if you weren't there, I bet you wish you had been. In her mad poem, Daddy, when we were talking about poetry, we might as well move on to the proper poet rather than me. In her manpower in Daddy, Sylvia Plath makes mention of a bag full of God. I've always taken this to be a misprint. If we consider that God is inexplicable and ineffable out with the scope of our puny human comprehension, then the idea that we could get hold of him and stuffing into a bag is plainly laughable. We can apply David Humes argument against miracles, where he writes, when anyone tells me that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact which he relates should really have happened. Similarly, we may ask, which is more probable that somebody managed to cram God into a bag, or a typesetting error has occurred? I'm sure as eggs is eggs, but what Plath originally wrote was a bag full of glue a slapdash printer by glue into gold, and the error has persisted for half a century. Now, it's true that glue is more often found in bottles and jars and squeezy tubes that in bags, but there are so many different types of glue for so many different purposes, that a bag full of glue is still a far more likely proposition than a bag full of God. just wander along the side of the aisles of your nearest supermarket, and you will see gurus for cleaning for cooking, for cosmetic purposes, and for all sorts of other uses. To goo can vary from thick paste to semi liquid Gloop, and no matter what it's consistency, any glue can be transferred from its original container into a bag, be it a plastic bag, a paper bag, a greaseproof paper bag, a satchel or have a sack, a Pipi bag, or any sort of bag you care to mention. While we can, excuse me, while we can only guess that the type of bag Sylvia Plath has in mind, and I strongly favor the duffel bag theory, we're on firmer ground when it comes to the glue. For later in the Mad poem, The Mad poet specifically refers to gobbly goo. Quiet quite what the nature of this glue is must remain a matter of conjecture. But in the context of the poem, it has some connection to the lift vafa the German word for National Military Aviation Services might gobbly goo then be some kind of lubricants guru for airplane engines. If so, that would explain why when I went to my local supermarket and asked at the customer services counter, if they stocked gobbly goo, I was met with blank looks of incomprehension, aeroplanes, airplane engine lubricants, goo is not the kind of glue you will find in even the best appointed supermarket or general goods store. Such fearless textual analysis, cast daddy in a new light and will necessitate the urgent revision of the thousands of scholarly books and articles about poor mad Sylvia. So get to work lit crit person's one final note

gu must not be confused with goop, which is a digital media and e commerce company company founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, who is inexplicable and ineffable and out with the scope of our puny human comprehension.

Finally, on this week's show I thought I'd check in another piece written 30 long years ago, and possibly be claimed from a stage in an orange nightclub. Well, I can't remember fairly typical of the kind of stuff I wrote at the time, and this predates the malice of forethought press. Bear that in mind, a long, long time ago. So long ago when all those people are rescued by operation you tree was still young. Anyway. banished to a pompous land where I knew no one. I said about mending my ways. There were flags to be downed ceremonial shields to be polished hospitality to be dispensed. At night I was seconded to stand guard at a gateway. The Gateway was made of solid gold. It was enormous. I sat hunched on a wooden stall alert and eagle eyed. I brandished my pike at the end of a passer by. But few passed by, and in the tiny hours I pondered and pondered hard, there was me felon rascal thief, and behind my back a gigantic gateway costume gold. One night, I took a rasp was dark and steel as I began to shave the goal from the gate, Dawn my satchel how the cellophane packet of gold and each night I added packet after packet. It's dawn again now. In an hour. They will take me away and behead me. It's called a bit melodramatic, isn't it? But anyway, that was almost canceled. juvenilia I suppose. But I've enjoyed reading those old pieces. But next week we'll be back with as we've had on the on the rest of the show. Bang up to date. Pros from Mr. Key. And like we've you know, we've had including an exciting piece about smokers Pop Tarts, which will be next week. Also a piece about ash, box, Elm. You saw that next week, by which time you'll have sent me vast amounts of money through the hooting yard. Pay Pal button or something. Yeah, bye bye.
