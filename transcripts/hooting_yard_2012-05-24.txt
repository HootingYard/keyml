Good evening resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. And I just had a bright idea about 30 seconds ago. Because I have my I've got my, what would the wonders of Wi Fi, or Wi Fi or whatever it is. I've got my internet link open, which means I've got my email open, which means that it occurred to me that if someone wanted to go to the hooting our website, and click on the PayPal button and send me a donation within the next 20 minutes, then it would appear and I would know about it, I think. And then whoever that person was, I could dedicate the show to them, or mention them by name and say this, this show was for bla bla bla bla bla. So go to the hooting your website, send me money. And anyone who does well will be mentioned on air with great gratitude. That probably isn't as exciting as I think it ought to be. But we'll see what happens. Anyway. One lot, a single task. One lot, two tasks. One lot, three tasks. One lot for tasks. One lot. Two tasks. To the director. Dear Sir, I have come to inquire if I have anything left on account with you. I wish to change today my booking on this ship whose name I don't even know. But anyway, it must be the ship from Athena. There are shipping lines going all over the place, but helpless and unhappy as I am. I can't find a single one. The first dog you meet in the street will tell you this. Send me the prices of the ship from Athena to su is I'm completely paralyzed. So I wish to embark in good time. Please let me know when I should be carried aboard. Thus, Arthur Rambo's last recorded word dictated in a delirium to his sister Isabel, from his Marcee hospital bed on the eve of his death on the 10th of November 1891. In his book, somebody else, Arthur Rambo in Africa 1888 to 1891 sorry 1882 1891. Charles Nicol writes, where or what Athena is, no one is sure. The phrase he uses is less service dafina, which seems to mean the ship from Athena, but could equally mean the Athena shipping line. So one cannot be quite sure if Athena is a place or a company, or even a particular captain. One cannot even be sure that Athena is what Rambo said. It's only Isabel's transcription. Was it rather, owl Athena, the Arab word for lighthouse? And was this Phantom ship which you wish to board in good time, the one that will carry him away from the light and into darkness.

But we must begin somewhere. So in the teeth of uncertainty, we dismiss the shipping line, the captain, the lighthouse, and we say the Athena is a place a city, a distant city across the sea, and we set out to find it with Pac 12 tusks divided into five lots into a Pipi bag, and we sling it over our shoulder. mindful that Rambo had lost his right leg to the surgeon saw on the 27th of May. We hobble our own right leg by less drastic means twine and cord, paps, or a tight burlap sack. And so on crutches, we make our way to the docks. It may be that we're setting out on a journey from which there will be no return a hopeless and pointless journey, like the one undertaken by the Japanese student. Who left her homeland in search of the fictional loot hidden under snow by the criminal Robert and kidnapper? Carl show Walter in Fargo. Joel and Ethan Coen 1996 the poor girl perished on her quest. And we too may face death before we reach Athena. The doctor, we lean upon our crutches and we cast an eye over the shit. We did not get a chance on the way here to ask questions about shipping of a dog in the street. The street was empty of dogs, as if Rambo had been here ahead of us and poisoned all the dogs just as he poisoned thousands of dogs in harar after curb pest on his animal hides hung out to dry in the hot, dusty Ethiopian air. The air here is neither hot nor dusty. It is better cold, even icy, and a glance at the sky reveals the near certainty of snow. And so we gaze from ship to ship. Look, there is the Hertz again ceci Lee magically restored from its wrecking off the Devon shear coast, it gleams and glistens, even shimmers. We haul ourselves onto the gangplank and it seems scarcely solid beneath our feet, our foot, a phantom ship perhaps for a phantom voyage to the distance city of AFI na. A board the captain greets us. What have you in that PV bag? He asks. We have 12 tasks in five lots, we reply. For like Rambo. We are honest, capable and courageous. I have cargo of grain and nitrate in the hold, says the captain, your tasks may be stored there for the duration of the voyage. We thank the captain and are glad to relinquish the Pipi bag of tasks to a sailor who carries it below. We do not know if ever we will see the bag the tasks again. But something tells us we will need the task to parlay our way through the massive wrought iron gate of the city of AFI na whether centuries must be bribed. shown by another sailor to our cabin we collapse upon our birth. We wait with the impatience of Rambo for the ship to sail. Rest flat out on the hard bunk. We are soon asleep and dreaming, and such dreams of Athens Ella and Ilg and Zimmerman of 2000 poisoned dogs have a season in hell of our right leg amputated and dumped in a Marseille incinerator. We are awake and are relieved to see our right leg present and correct, though numbed? Would it destroy a purpose of our journey to free it from twine and cord from the tight burlap sack to shake the life back into it and go walking on the deck of the hurts or getting set early on in crushed rock Rambo had not that option at the end. But nor as far as we know. Did he ever reach AFI? Nah, it will surely do us no harm to walk on two legs as Rambo did for untold miles in Europe and Africa until his final monopod month. And so we free the numbed leg and leap from the bunk and cut two or three brisk capers around the room like Boswell in the morning. But it is not morning. When we leave our cabin and go out on deck we see it is night,

vast illimitable and starless there is no sign of the captain nor his crew. There is no sign of a living soul. Yet the ship the ship, it is riding the waves fast and steady and straight sails billowing Nothing can stop us. We are on our way to AFI na.

Donations update several thousand people have actually donated in the last 10 minutes. Oh no, that's a mistake. No one's donated at all. So but you know, you still can you've got 20 minutes to go, or about 18 and then you'll have your name read out on the air if you do, hooting our website, hit the donate button, enter your bank account. Thank you very much. Itsy Bitsy do Pepsi popsy Pap, which is by way of saying, I've been giving very careful thought to the dumbing down of hooting yard. It's always been my fondest wish, indeed, my determination that each and every dispatched from hooting yard is read and listened to by each and every person throughout the land, from the shadow lane in her castle to the peasant in his ditch. It's not that I caught popularity as such, rather than I know in my bones the inevitable benefit of hooting yd upon the human brain. We live at a time however, when something like a fifth of our state self esteem and diversity hub pupils leave after 11 years of compulsory faffing about barely able to read that meaning. So if I wish my words to be read by all I clearly need to pick my prose at the semi literate. Initially, I wonder if my vast archive could be turned into a set of simple pictograms, but that same defeatist then I stumbled upon a couple of books which might serve as models for the new inclusive hooting yard. The first is a little less sorry little lessons for little learners in words of one syllable, printed and published by F Babcock in 1840. Here is one of the little lessons in full the pagan the dog see the fat owl pig. He cannot run this hot day. The sun is hot and he is too fat. But the dog can run and he can get the pig by the air. See he has bit the pig on the leg and now it is all red. Oh dog do not do so to the fat or pig. Tom run and put the pig in his thigh and do not let the dog get at him. Run Run for now the dog has gotten by the air. Hit the dog Tom if he will not let the pig go. See how read his ear is. How did the pig get out of his thigh? Why sir the bar was not up. I did not put it up when I fed him. Well put it up now you are to see to it. Now let us all go in for it is a hot day. It is too hot for us to be out in the sun. Tom, did you put the pig in his thigh? Yes sir. And I put the bar up so he can now not get out and the dog cannot get in this splendid stuff. One might prefer Tom to be encouraged to poison the dog as if he were Arthur Rambo, rather than merely to hit it, but that's a minor cavil. It's morally improving instructive, and action packed. In other words, pretty much like your average hooting your postage. And though as I've said, the basic idea is for little Mohammed and little dimity to be able to read it themselves. It's mono syllabic. nature makes it an ideal text to be shouted or better screeched staccato. And menacingly at a roomful of terrorized tinies. Once we've slashed out the brains of the self esteem and diversity facilitators, they should realize and relish the efficacy of this method. The other book to act as a model for new hooting yard pros is a child's life of Christ, from his birth to his ascension in glory by an unknown author, for which I cannot find a date. Although this invaluable tome was published in our Thomas's one syllable series, it does include words of more than one syllable. Well, the word Jesus, but helpfully divided it into two as in this thrilling extract.

As soon as the storm had been stilled, they sailed to land. And when Jesus stepped on shore, a man who had fiends came to meet him. He was such a fierce man, that no one dad go near him. More than once his friend had bound him with trains to keep him at home, but that did no good for he broke the trains and ran off and he didn't cave Sam had been dug in the sides of the hills for tombs. There he would stay day and night, and would cry out loud and cut his flesh with stones. He would tear off his clothes too, and no one could do a thing to help him or make him left like a wild beast. But when he saw Jesus, he ran to him and cried with a loud voice, what have I to do with the Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God, I pray thee not to hurt me. Then Jesus by the fiends, for there was more than one of them come out of this poor man, a large herd of swine fed on our high hill nearby, and when the themes found they must come out of the mind, they begged that g SOS would let them go in the swine. He said they might do so. And as soon as the herd felt the themes in them, they rushed down the side of the steep hill, and were drowned in the sea. Then, the men who took care of the swine ran to the town, and told all that they had seen ghee sauce do, and the folks went out and begged him to leave their coasts. When they saw the theist, wild man closed, and in his right mind, and when they heard of the fate of the swine, they feared to have Jesus stay in their land. The man out of whom the fiends had been cast was so full of love, and thanks to G zaf, that he begged to stay with him all the time. But g zaf knew it was best for him to be with his own folks. So he said, Go home to my friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for the man did as he was bed, and soon the whole town knew and spoke of the strange tale. I suspect, incidentally, that this man who had themes was actually the grunty man, or, as I suppose we should say, for grande tea man, just as the great 20th century pamphleteer. Dobson henceforth be referred to as dobb. Son. So I have much work to do. I'll have to trawl through eight years worth of archives amending all the hooting yard text into dumbed down malo syllables, but it will be worth it. If only because when I'm done, I'll be able to shout or better screech staccato and menacingly, the texts of roomfuls of terrorized Chinese, they will learn and I will be amused, it is as a dumbed down person might say, a win win, sit sick you a tion.

drive to the forest and a Japanese car when it begins to rain and it will it will turn on the windscreen wipers. They will Swish swish swish back and forth across the windscreen of the Japanese car, just like they do across the windscreen of Marian cranes car in psycho to ensure that however heavy and pelting the rain becomes and it will pelt it will you will still be able to see the road ahead clearly enough to drive in the dark and the rain past Box Hill towards the forest in a Japanese car. Sometimes the rain pelts down so relentlessly that even the squishiest and swooshy is to have windscreen wipers set to their most rapid swishing and swooshing a barely able to wipe the raindrops from the windscreen so hard and fast as the rain pelt down and in the dark of an earthly night it can be the devil of a job to keep a clear view of the road ahead. Such were the circumstances that led Mary and crane to stop at the Bates Motel. Her car was not a Japanese one. She was not on her way to the forest. I've got binoculars on top of Box Hill On protected from the relentless pelting rain by an anorak, a southwest and the roof of a bird spotters hidey hole. Because my shelter is drying more or less, and my vision is acute, I can see clearly through the lenses of my binoculars. I would not need wipers even wear the binoculars fitted with them, which of course they're not. I have trained my binoculars on the road below. And now you come sweeping into view driving to the forest in a Japanese car. I slowly adjust the angle of the binoculars so I can follow your progress. It is not clear whether there was a hill like Box Hill in the vicinity of the Bates Motel. But had there been then Arbogast might have been stood atop it with binoculars, watching Marion crane pull in and park the private detective would have had plenty of time to scamper down the hillside and jump into his car and rev the engine and tear across to the Bates Motel and forestall the horror. Arbogast was not there on some putative hill with binoculars. But I am the windscreen wipers of your Japanese car switching and switching back and forth as rapidly as it's possible for them to do but now the relentlessness of the pelting rain redoubled and it's almost impossible for you to see clearly the road ahead towards the forest. You're driving more and more slowly and with increasing difficulty and a voice in your head tells you to pull over and stop in a lay by the voices are sober and sensible one and not at all like the voice Norman Bates his in his head when Marion crane comes to the Bates Motel. Through my binoculars on top of Box Hill, I can see you have pulled into a laybuy and come to a stop in your Japanese car. I tuck the binoculars into the PICHETTE on a lanyard around my neck and I scamper down Box Hill to where my own car is parked. It is not a Japanese car. Its windscreen wipers are no more or no more nor less efficient than yours. But my vision is acute and I'm a fantastic driver. So for me it is child's play to rev the engine and tear across to the laybuy where you are parked. I pull up behind your Japanese car and stop the engine and get out of my car and slam the door shut behind me and splash through the puddles towards your car. I am wearing waterproof boots. I draw level with the window on the driver side of your Japanese car and peering in. I'm disconcerted to see that you're not sitting in the driver's seat, nor have you shifted to the passenger seat nor to either of the backseat. You are not in the car. You must have gone somewhere on foot through the puddles in the dark in the pelting rain while I was making my way to the laybuy from the top of Box Hill. I stand next to your Japanese car and take the binoculars out of the pocket on a lanyard around my neck and pair through them

so relentlessly is the pelting rain that I wish oh I wish I had wipers fitted to my binoculars. I cannot see a thing in any direction. I can only assume that for some reason you have splashed through the puddles to the forest, the edge of which is about half a mile away. I decided to follow you in my waterproof boots. This is ancient and dense forest and no felling has taken place to make a clearing in which your motel might be erected. It would not in any case, make an app site for a motel. As soon as the house like that adjoining the Bates Motel might be apt where there are clearing but there is not. So to find you I have to seek signs like a tracker. Soon enough I come upon you squatting by a fall and log upon which you have set a camping gas stove. You are preparing tea and sausages along the log from the stove. You have placed a cassette player Hold it right there. I cry. You spin around astonished. picnic police. I cry Don't move Dammit, you matter. There are some people who praise picnicking in the British countryside. I do whatever it takes to eradicate it. I place you under arrest. The cassette plays pop tones.

That's almost the end of this week's show. And still, no one has sent me any money. There you go. Story of my life Really? Never mind. And I thought before we go very quickly, there's a there's a brand new book out out published yesterday, called the curious cookbook published by the British Library, and its subtitle is Viper soup, badger, ham, stewed sparrows and 100 more historic recipes. fantastic book, and I should declare an interest. The author Peter Ross is my oldest friend. We met when we were 11 at school. But in spite of that friendship, it's a fantastic book and there's only time to read you one recipe. But this is from a kitchen goes to war. Famous people contribute 150 recipes to a ration time cookery book published in 1940. Now those of you old enough will remember jack Warner Dixon of green and in 1940 jack provided this fantastic recipe for readers. It's called trees and chutney biscuit ingredient. One doesn't water biscuit, two ounces of margarine or butter, two tablespoons of chutney, and about a quarter pound of cheese. Now you have to listen very carefully to the preparation method. Because if you get any of this wrong, you destroy it. Spread the biscuits with margarine or butter. Put slices of cheese on top. Put some chutney on top of the slices of cheese. I don't know if you'll be able to manage that. But that's jack Warner's cheese and chutney biscuit and a fantastic recipe it is perhaps Next week I'll give you Agatha Christie's mystery potatoes. Bye bye
