Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you what I'm going to read to you this week. And next week is Danny Blanche Fowler, a life in football, which is an old malice aforethought press pamphlet originally published in about 1991. I think there were other. I think there were about 25 copies or maybe 50. And I don't know what's happened to it. I've only got one copy left myself. I might even sell it to you if you want to buy the going rate for old malice aforethought press pamphlets, seems these days to be between about 150 or 200 pounds, much to my astonishment. And if you think you might want to buy it, drop me a line at hooting dot yard at Google mail.com. And meanwhile, I'll read this. It's a long story, so I'll start it this week. And presumably, next week's show will be the completion of it. And Danny Blanchflower, a life in football, interesting introductory remarks. Little is known of the origins of football, a game which is today one of the most popular sports throughout the northern land. According to smet in the Punnett, volume 16. Number nine, football began when tribal elders in the hinterland around Hoon took to mucking about irresponsibly after the annual ostrich battery. Thumper, on the other hand, has argued in a number of her essays, that the sordid and disreputable practices of a family living in a cave near bulges spinny are the true origins of the game. Either of these theories may be true, as might thousands of others, but let us not tarry in the past. The rules of football are stupendously complex, the rubric itself fills hundreds of huge volumes and interpretive texts. And now essays and commentaries have accumulated at such a rate that entire libraries are now devoted to the subject. That being the case, it's impractical in this introduction to do more than sketch the Marist outline. The listener will need some familiarity with the Laws of the Game better to appreciate the potty the biography which follows so let us draw breath take stock make a cup of tea Tango ukulele, skip frolicsome through Ling and haver rap curses at hunched louts sprinkled talc upon our scouts whisk an egg brush our teeth in paella mothball cracker biscuit, mumble a homily tie our ships not in a necklace. Stoke up the fire spit on the coals aurka butcher cracker neck stamp on a B shovel grit outside the police station how the word go mitigator play suffer a plaster fold a crocus employ a grotesquerie and put a flea in its ear. Come follow me as I expand the laws of football. There are excuse me, there are two teams of 31 players each plus a moderator to assistant moderators, a plinth sergeant, a Brazil nut attendant and a person holding a tape measure. The teams are dubbed bark and sap. These terms are as arbitrary as the use of say white and black to differentiate chess pieces, or the pigs and cones used in the game of lantern draw. Each team consists of 10 jack halibuts 10 Cecily Courtney ages, six badges, a winch, a hurdle, a cake, a denial and a pond. Only two badges may be failed at one time. Unless the winch is out of play. Players may make use of bats sticks, hook poles, claw hammers, Lance's ball bearings, fence posts, swords, bayonets, door handles fireworks and icing sugar. At the beginning of play, the moderator tosses onto the rink three balls, one is of leather, one of bladder and one of zinc. Surprisingly, the rules say nothing about the size of the balls, and there is a great variation among those commonly in use.

The object of the game is For the bark team to puncture the lever and bladder balls beyond repair and to hide the zinc ball for a minimum period of 23 hours. While we sack team must try to protect all three balls by encasing them in wicker containers and keeping the opposing side away from them for an identical period. The field of play is called the pitch rink, arena, clap forward or basin, it is marked out with an intricate tangle of signs and symbols. Only the person with the tape measure is privy to the meaning of all of them. Everyone else's knowledge is partial as for the size of the field, that is beyond rational conjecture, so do not think about it, do not think about it at all. This is not to suggest that the field is some sort of limitless expanse. If anything, the reverse would be near the truth, but only just and still so far from reality that it would be a complete distortion, it's best simply not to think about the field ever. A true appreciation of football is hampered by the difficulty of understanding the subsidiary objectives or planks of the game. The object as I have just outlined is of course of primary importance, and both players and officials must keep it in the forefront of their brains to the virtual exclusion of any other thought process. Virtual is the key word here because the exceedingly narrow gap left for other ideas to seep into the brain is the conduit through which the concept of the planks must pass. Either of the assistant moderators may impose planks at the start of the game or in the intervals between each fit. There is an enormous list of planks and the rulebooks from which are selected and may be made. A brief sample here can do no more than suggest an idea of the subtlety of thought, which has developed in this aspect of football over the years. taken literally at random. The list of planks includes the following. digging a trench across the rink, sawing off the handles of the opposing teams swords, planning, preparing, cooking, serving and eating a garlic pie. synchronized palpitation, instilling an overwhelming sense of wistfulness in one's teammates, flooding the rink, dismantling the wicked accordion contest. A variation recently introduced into the professional game is for the assistant moderators to vie with each other in imposing mutually incompatible planks, incompatible in that the selections are physically and or mentally impossible to achieve together. Some commentators hold that this introduces an element of competition between the officials which distracts from the splenetic rivalry of the two teams, and they may have a point bagshawe and tapflo are the most notable representatives of the opposing views in this argument. penalties are vicious, arbitrary and senseless. Only the moderator and the Clint Sargent are permitted to impose penalties, and they must consult with each other in writing before the penalty can be implemented. Please do not be given the impression that there is any element of violence or general nastiness in the penalties. There viciousness, arbitrariness and senselessness are of a much higher order, which is inconceivable to those who have not themselves played football. to tabulate the penalties in any detail would be to muddy the waters further. And that's not my intention. The kit or strip is of admirable simplicity, the sap team invariably appears naked, with the small concessions and modesty of skin tight flesh colored tunics. In this case, flesh colored means precisely what it says. The garments are dyed to the precise shade of the individual players skin by experts retained by the Football Association. The bark team, on the other hand, is kitted out in voluminous clothing suitable for an Antarctic Expedition. All furs hides and swaddling with plenty of pockets pouches, flaps, zips, buttons, toggles belts and buckles. As the game is played all year round, the sap team has a natural advantage in the summer months, while the bark team will tend to perform better in the biting chill of winter.

But enough of these confounded rules, as it is their elastic very elastic. So much depends upon the temperament of the Brazilian that attendant in whose hands the very nature of the game can be transformed to the extent that the rules I have so patiently explained would be unrecognizable to you, dear listener. The commentaries on the role of this official are abstruse and profound, and deserving of years and years of study clabber in her invaluable pamphlet, the Brazil nut attendant, retribution and paralysis has come closest to providing a manageable overview of the subject. Although her tendency to refer to the gamers soccer is regrettable. before bringing this introduction to a sprightly close, it will be helpful to give the reader the listener some idea of the games organization, particularly in the professional sphere, the two Chief Administrative bodies of the Football Association and the Football League. The former is a severe and monolithic organization, which ensures that the rules of the game are adhered to by all parties at all times. That has a staff of 800 scriveners Clark's and lackeys who work by the light of just four Tilly lamps. These saintly men and women spend their working lives issuing lengthy directives couched in the language, so mesmeric that the recipients throw them up once into the dustbin, without even trying to wring any sense out of them. This cavalier attitude on the part of the club's has it repercussions of course. From time to time, the association sends out inspectors highly trained gets plucked from sinks of corruption with murder in their eyes and blackjacks in their fists. No club visited by an inspector has ever dared to transgress the rules again. The Football Association also holds an annual competition, the winning team of which is awarded the Fred Jessen cup perhaps football's most prized trophy. Bird holes mighty tome from custard to wooziness provides a splendid history of the contest, and addresses the more arcane aspects of its marking system, the contemplation of which has led countless devotees to was sorry Brink sudden demise of the Football League However, there's nothing remotely interesting to be said. So we may now proceed heart's pumping violently to the main purpose of this essay, which is to outline the career of Danny Blanche Fowler hirota millions.

So onwards with Danny Blanchflower, a life in football. Danny blonde Fowler is universally considered to be the finest Cicely Courtney of the modern game. It comes with some surprise then to learn that for the first eight years of his career, before turning professional, he played interchangeably as a denial and a cake. his mentor in the early years, the International Coach lipno, true, recalled that blonde Fowler struck him immediately as a singular talent. I don't think I ever saw a player more at home on the class. He told Bagshaw, his dedication was tremendous. 40 hours before the start of a match, he'd already be out there, winding the propellers, laying out the iron knobs, licking the rake balancing a pill on a funnel, singing Devin spirits, Mitt Veta fan, tracking flax, Bing, a rubber roping the bucket. None of it necessary, of course, but you know what these footballers are with their superstitions and pre match rituals. By kick off time, it was like a lit fuse. I'd trained some of the greatest names in football, but I'd never seen anything like Danny. He seemed to sparkle. But what's going on here? Here we are with blonde Fowler preparing for a match and we have yet to consider his ancestry birth, childhood formative influences and adolescence this cannot be let us begin at the beginning. valdemar blonde Fowler, Danny's father was something of a flop. He had a predilection for extravagant casseroles which ruined his marriage. And eventually cost him his job. At the time his only son was born. Blanche Fowler pair was a superintendent as an ink factory. his duties were onerous, and the little leisure time he had he devoted to the student himself in evermore ridiculous frills and furloughs and working on his gigantic recipe book. unpublished at his death, and ever since. The manuscript runs through over 2000 pages, detailing innumerable casserole recipes ordered alphabetically according to their main ingredient. For all his energy valdemar was an unimaginative chef. over a quarter of the book is headed our is for Rama bean, and it is only due to the fame of his son that he's remembered at all. The combination of work fuckery and culinary obsession being what it was father and son spent little time together. Blanche Fowler remembers one occasion when he and his father spent an afternoon jumping about near a canal to celebrate the boy's 10th birthday. Within weeks, however, valldemossa was dead stabbed in the forehead by one of his fellow Fox during a tussle fought over a cummerbund. Many blonde fella named Rodriguez canteloupe ping gretta was an equally destabilizing influence on her son, severely aesthetic and unutterably miserable, she left a little child's to his own devices, while she inhaled me of toxic fumes from a special jar she kept tucked inside her vest. She rarely entered the family bungalow in the grounds of the ink factory, preferring to sit hunched in a nearby ditch, letting handfuls of soil run through her fingers and winching interminably nothing was too insignificant or miniscule for her to focus her complaints upon long into the night. She would usually late and whine about trees, bridges, skullcaps, vegetable oil parakeets, wall loots, Crete, mathematics bilgewater, deathless tunnels, mozzarella, barbican's, French tugboats, candelabras winsomeness, pettifogging Hale Indigo roots Mark Hare sindarin kreiss sawston pullies vinegar, defrayed purchases illicit cargo, the Uber menge glossolalia custard miasma has forked lightning, stew bins, clocks, horas, and potty. When little Danny came tugging at her sleeved a mule about his pencil case, she would cut him about their head and drone on for hours about the hopelessness of pencil cases past and present. She perished in a tempest. On the day Danny won his first international hat.

He was born in hooting yard on the 14th of January 1916. There is some doubt as to whether Danny that is Daniel was in fact his given name. The registrar who inscribe the birth certificate was drunk and hapless and smudged his penmanship while taking a swig from a flask of gin. Blonde Fowler's parents never called him by that name as far as we have been made aware, his father addressed him languidly foppish early as little one, while his mother scarcely cease moaning long enough to insert any term of the dress or affection into her incessant litanies of doom. He first became known as Danny when he attended the hooting yard Academy for tinies between the ages of four and eight. From there he progressed to the ink factories own educational college for the seed engendered by factory workers, a rather slapdash institution housed in a canvas tent next to the duck pond at the very edge of the factory grounds. The college curriculum was a masterpiece of stupidity and boredom, devised by the headmaster and only teacher, one f x glob. The Education of Young Children Thunder the globe in his treated bones and spittle is presently in the hands of idiots, pimps and knaves, it is time to call a halt. The gloves system is the only method guaranteed to nurture in the young, a proper appreciation of truth and a slavish devotion to knowledge. Gloves system involves the delivery of three hour lectures on his pet subject, chiefly ink pencils, haberdashery bitterns, wax sackbut turpentine And molluscs, each team the age term, the series of lectures would be repeated word for word until even the most recalcitrant pupil could recite them from memory. Once this had been achieved, glubb moved on to the advanced study of the very same subject taught in the same way. His oratorical gifts were slight. This slobbering john to the man would rest crumpled, leaning on his lectern, peering at his notes and mattering in an astonishingly wrecked voice. His head was often swayed in bandages, and this made his lectures even more difficult to follow. The pupils were expected to sit slightly balanced on their knees, noting the salient points of each subject, using the pitiful sliver of chalk supplied to each child at the billing beginning of its schooling.

From time to time, other subjects would be introduced by a tenner and quacks who were lured to the college by glob and forced to bone up on obscure and pointless chapters in obscure and pointless books. It was through the agency of one such quack that the 11 year old Blanche Fowler first encountered football, arch and diminutive Bala glob button glue motor precarious living, roaming the countryside selling beetles to insect merchants and concocting spurious dinosaur bite remedies. Until the day he ran into FX glob while traversing barges Spinney. Easily bribed with mustard button glue was quickly installed at the College, where glubb set him to work as a lecturer in sand. Unlike many of his predecessors, button glue discovered a previously untapped talent for digesting reams of stultifying Lee down gibberish and often sat up all night reading and rereading the books glubb gave them preparing his lectures with gusto. In one of these books, the quack turned pedagogue chanced upon a passage describing the importance of sand in amateur football games. It's worth quoting a brief excerpt here, the passages from Baxter's toffee Compendium, gentle reader, it says, I asked you if it is possible to understand how in a game of football, the hurdle or indeed the jack holbert would be able even to contemplate stepping onto the pitch had they not concealed in their remarkable hairstyles, a little leather pouch filled with sand, crude sand, which in the course of play, but usually during the first and second fit only, they will sprinkle sneakily, while no one is looking into the six yard box, the better to baffle their opponents in ways which must remain a mystery to those of us who feckless as we are, have never spent a profitable Friday afternoon, taking part in that majestic sport for little or no reward, but the knowledge that in doing so we may yet retrieve a measure of insensible bliss. Quite why this drivel charge button glues imagination is unclear. We know however, that from the day he read this passage, and the 40 pages of equally indigestible sand and football related meditations which follow it. He became obsessed with the game with gloves blessing he absented himself from the college on numerous occasions, traveling the length and breadth of whom to attend football matches. He saw all the great teams of the day, hooting yard wanderers, the barges spinny man hoots, impetigo lane, sorry, impetigo lane, amnesiacs and a score of others, and rapidly became an expert in specialized fields such as pond spotting, trailing the Cicely Courtney jizz, flickering and cartridge monitoring. See Thumper for explanatory notes on these terms. According to batten glues diary, it was on the 23rd of June 1927. That glove granted permission for Danny Blanchflower to accompany him to a football match. Teacher and pupil went to a third round Cup tie between North small pig academic And the railway Terminus blankets. Button glue had taken a liking to the thoughtful and spindly 11 year old whom he had noticed scribbling furiously on his slides whenever he touched upon football in his sand lectures. Blanche Fowler insisted later that he thought his teacher was talking about night jars. Although button glue had a devilishly rum accent, it's difficult to give credence to this recollection. What can be said with certainty is that after seeing his first football match, blonde Fowler was hooked. He became even more indefatigable when his teacher regularly playing truant to loiter around the hooting yard wanderers Stadium, and even hiking to distant parts of the land to see obscure clubs and little known players. glubb forbade his pupils to read anything other than a limited selection of books devoted his pet subject. With button glues help, however, Blanche Fowler managed to smuggle into the college copies of football periodicals like the Punnett and crusts from the winch. He was soon a walking encyclopedia of football facts and figures, able for example, to recite the names of every pond and badger to play in an international match since 1744.

Opportunities for actual play were limited. Glub frowned upon physical exercise, and these only concession was to allow the pupils to power volts across the duck pond on Sundays and religious holidays. But glubb was the sound sleeper, and at night, Blanche Fowler and button glue would Rouse 66 of the college's pupils, janitors and caretakers and hold illicit football matches by torchlight in the grounds of the ink factory. Though bleary eyed and muddle headed, the pressganged players gradually develop possible skills at the game. And Blanche Fowler later declared that he could have had no better training ground in which to hone his skills. Their matches had to be truncated so that all the participants were back in their hammocks. By the time glob woke up at dawn, and there's a necessity for quiet that other adjustments in their play, so that various impromptu rules were established, no sword sharpening the substitution of a pillow for the zinc board, a ban on the customary howling during the fourth fit, and so on. By coincidence at around this time, lippen note two came to hooting yard as a badger Lieutenant for the wonders. We do not know if he was aware of the nocturnal matches taking place at the ink factory, nor whether he met Blanche Fowler when the boy absconded from the college to hang about at the stadium. Such possibilities must remain one of history's great What if there can be little doubt that sooner or later, his future mentor would have encountered Blanche Fowler and the latter shining career could have began 10 years earlier than it did. Perhaps perhaps what happened was markedly different and completely unexpected. On the 15th of November 1928, just after duck pond break, Danny Blanche Fowler was abducted by bandits.

And all that exciting moment, which will leave Danny blonde fella a life in football for the time being. I'll be back next week to continue it. I'm beginning to think that it might take three weeks to read the story is very long. I hope you've enjoyed it. If not, well, you know, don't tune in, but I do hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back next week with part two. Bye bye for now.
