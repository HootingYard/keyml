Music tells you it's time for hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, this is resonance 104 point four FM or live from London. Call that Saturday excited, unaccountably exciting. Let's bring things back down to the level of tvm that they're meant to be. And if you want to pursue a career as a robber baron, the very first step you need to take is to establish your baronetcy. You need to ensure that it has at least a pattern of legitimacy. For you do not want naysayers and busybodies, calling it into question. youngsters who seek my advice, are often surprised that wearing a burnished golden helmet while sitting astride a mighty steed is not in itself sufficient claim to be a Baron. Of course, it's essential to have such a helmet on such a horse. No self respecting robber baron could expect to go about his baronial robberies without them. But I'm afraid the drudgery of paperwork has to take precedence. You can pluck the name of your baronet's the out of the air mattress he might invent the name of a monster in a bedtime story for tinies. But if possible, it's best to take on the approbation of a genuine baronetcy, one that has fallen into disuse accrued where the last Baron died hundreds of years ago. Without issue. Many barons fell in battle in far distant lands. So a good start would be to check up on the manifest of ruinous military expeditions. Obviously, whenever a Baron fell on the open battlefield, he was almost certainly on Horst. So that serves as a reminder for you to choose your speed Well, when we come to the prickly topic of speed cruising. Once you've picked an extinct baronetcy to revive, you will need a coat of arms. Don't fall on your head too much. We've always heraldry words like as your ghouls and rampant and Argent and just make sure you have something that pleases you. And that won't look good emblazoned on the shield's carried proudly by your mask outriders. You might be able simply to appropriate the actual coat of arms of the dead Baron needs to planted but to do so risks, alerting the busy bodies. And you might be faced with hard questions you will be in no position to answer. In any case, nothing could be easier than designing a coat of arms. It really is child's play. You could even hire an orphan from Pang Hill orphanage to do the job for you. With your baronetcy secure ish, and the spindly often beavering away at your coat of arms, the time has come to obtain a mighty speed. I cannot emphasize enough just how important this is. Without a suitable horse all else is naught. At this point up goes the cry. But where do I find a horse? Well, in my baby with horses are usually to be found standing in fields or if the weather is inclement, in what are known as paddocks. What you need to do is wait until nightfall when their human guards will all be tucked up in bed and creep stealthily to a field or paddock armed with a torch and a bag of bums. You will use the torch to examine in the engulfing darkness such features of your prospective horse as its main fetlocks and winners. Look closely at the musculature. Remember that the horse you choose will be galloping across the land with you astride its back for many years to come. When you have picked a suitable Steve laya trial of bands from the field or paddock to the gates of your castle, nearly all horses find bands irresistible. And depending on how far the field or pabrik is from your castle, your mighty speed should be safe in its new home by break of dawn. It is good practice at this point to pop down to the center. To check up on the often

you are now nearly ready to go marauding and to strike terror into the country folk for miles around. But remember the earlier I mentioned your mask outriders, you will need these accomplices partly for emotional and psychological support, but mainly to help you carry back to your baronial castle, the booty from your robberies. Up opinions differ on how many masks outriders, a robber baron needs, but as a rule of thumb to would be an absolute minimum and four or five are preferable. The more masked outriders you have, the more saddlebags can be filled with clinking threatening baubles and coinage. When you've decided on the number you can get the orphan to make the masks once the coat of arms is finished. Very occasionally masked outriders will work on a freelance basis, but it's far more common for them to live in your castle, and they will expect a share of the booty. Just be on your guard that nun among the number gets apathy and plots to use up you from your baronetcy. Such things have happened of course, so always be prepared to offer small brides. Leftover bands from the bag used to abduct your horse for example, or in an extremity chop that would be user that a bit with a broad sword. You should have a collection of these releasable blades displayed upon the wall of the main hall of your baronial castle, get the orphan to polish and buff them regularly. With the bulk of your preparatory work done, all that remains is for you to set out on your first robbery. It is at this stage that many a NEO fight has moral qualms. If until now, you've been a law abiding sought. conscientious when it comes to paying your bus fare, and never dropping litter. You may get a bit jittery at the prospect of robbing people. That's why you should begin by robbing another Baron. Later on with some experience under your belt. You will be able to waylay little bands of peasants and take away all their potatoes, as you cackle with evil Glee, but to get you started, there's nothing like another Baron, preferably a robber baron like you are setting out to be. So how do you go about it? First, gather your masked outriders around the table in your baronial Hall. They do not need to be wearing their masks just yet, and you will be able to judge their readiness for the task ahead by studying their faces in the light of the flames roaring from the magnificent fireplace. Half the often posted there, regularly feeding more logs onto the Blaze. Each Outrider should have been provided with a goblet brimming with a frothy alcoholic potion, gigantic flagons of which arrived on a sideboard for wherever a refill is needed. Let them Carew's and wassail for a little while to pick them up, then spread out a big map on the table. This map could show nearby baronial halls with tracks and pathways leading to and from them. You will have made a careful study of the comings and goings of other robber barons and thus be in a position to know when one of them will be cantering gently along a woodland path astride his own mighty speed, possibly on his way to an acid donation with a comely damsel. Use a crayon to mark the likely spot for an ambuscade on the map, and ensure that each of your masked outriders knows how to get there. Clap your goblets together in a mark of camaraderie, stamp out of the hall with great determine stride and make a final check that everyone has empty saddlebags ready to be filled with booty. Now is the time to set your horses galloping, and to crash through the trees towards the unsuspecting barren. Do bear in mind that your victim may have his own masked outriders and indeed, the gentle cantering of his steed can be deceptive. If he is not just a plain Baron, but a robber baron. He may be setting out to rob someone himself.

Here's why you and your mask outriders armed to the teeth with the various polished and buffed swords from your baronial Hall. In order to fill your saddlebags with booty, you might have to slash and thrust at the Baron and his masked outriders until we're reduced to a pile of corpses on the woodland path, their blood and gore gleaming in the dappled sunlight shining through the trees.

Frank Key  10:39
If this is the case, it's worthwhile stopping them, stripping them of their armor and adding that to your booty. You can take their horses to either by pulling them along on a length of string or by laying a trail of bonds back to your castle. However, it is a perturbing fact, but this being your first baronial, rubbery human your mask outriders may well come off worse in any slashing and thrusting of lethal blades.

Frank Key  11:21
If you are worried that it will be your blood and gore gleaming in the dappling sunlight and your mighty steed which follows a trail of bands back to another robber barons castle, you may want to reconsider whether you're making the right career choice. You may decide you are better suited to being a posty or a Scrivener or the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Brightside.

I'm nearly ready, hang on, we'll have a bit more music.

I'm just recovering in recovering from a head cold. So I'm not quite peak of health are vestiges of the head cold, which, hence the coughing and that little pools, but I'll see if I can get through the next item on today's show, which is a botany messam. In today's botany lesson, we're going to study a stalk of fastens bladder work, we're going to examine it very very closely with the naked eye and then under a microscope, and then from an exemplary distance through a telescope, with your fairly significant having first hand on nasal passages cleared and fumigated with a nasal fumigation, siphon and pump contraption specially made for us by a boffin. We're going to test the effect upon IQ of both extreme heat and extreme cold, as well as room temperature and other exemplary temperatures it is likely to encounter in what can laughingly still be referred to as the real world. Thus far I have spoken of both distance and temperature being exemplary, and I'm not finished with my exemplars. We are going to attach electrical wires to the stalk of Grafton, Butterworth, and subjected to low and high voltages using a targeted electrical voltage delivery contraption specially made for us by a boffin. We shall designate one such voltage as an exemplary voltage for reasons which will become apparent. emotion in a tub of water will be the next step. We will be using water from the duck pond having first boiled it and allowed it to call the water water will be collected from the duck pond in piles then transferred to a pan. It will be allowed to cool in the pan before being poured into the tub through a funnel. Rubber gloves will be worn during this procedure. The color of the rubber gloves worn is open to choice except that might not be the same color as the stalk of fattens bladder work. rubber glove pigmentation chart has been specially prepared for us by a buffing and we can refer to it before plumping for our rubber gloves. We will then test the pH value of the stalk of fattens bladder work before breaking for lunch. Lunch will be served in the sixth floor canteen, the prices are reasonable and the queues are short. There is a goodly selection of pies cereals, trunks of identified meat, oats, barley, fever, ease from squirrels, winter storage, bike turnips, cocoa powder, blood oranges, various animal innards, gravy in boats and gravy in a spoon, plums balsamic vinegar, toffee pudding. daintily challenging biscuits and crackers. clam chowder wafers with a drizzle of light Ale, pastries, dried citrus husks, pastries, dried citrus husks, but among lemon curd, bogs, slug and aspirins. The sing song will take place immediately after lunch in the sixth floor canteen annex. Song sheets in a bold hectoring typeface have been specially prepared for us by a magical list. upon our return, we will slice up the stalk of fattens bladder word with a big sharp, exemplary slicing implement. They will then be a test paper in multiple choice format to be completed in pencil. The rubber gloves should be disposed of down a chute, the location of which will be announced in due time. Any questions?

Any questions? Not I didn't receive any questions during that little interlude. So we're gonna go on

vestiges of head cold not withstanding. Talk to any spell anchor. And you will soon learn that nobody who strays into the horrible cave emerges with their wits intact. Sometimes their hair turns white, they shake and they have to be fed with slops. Others retire to farm yards and spend the rest of their lives among pot bellied pigs. Yes, still, the reckless and the foolhardy risk their sanity by ignoring the big signpost I hammered into the ground that the approach to the horrible cave. This is the horrible cave reads my notice. If you have a shred of sense, you will dust not enter. I spent quite some time on that wording and ended up in hospital because I queued the end of my pencil so fact fretfully that I contracted lead poisoning. it's by no means a pretty ailment. But I would much rather suffer that from the terrible derangement of those who stepped but once into the horrible cave. While I was in the hospital, I was visited by a government agent, who was curious about my signpost. I suspected he was from some secret agency, where he was dressed in a trim black suit and did not remove his sunglasses. He had very close cropped hair cut, carried and attached a case which I noticed was chained to his wrist, and he seemed to exude the sense of frangipani or dogbane, which is often a telltale sign of covert operatives in my country. Standing beside The bed on which driveway splayed out. He introduced himself as Christopher Plummer. Not to be confused with the actor who played after Harper in the Royal hunt of the sun, he added horridly although that time the name was new to me, I have since followed the agents namesakes career with growing interest. I was subjected to a series of questions about the signpost I had placed near the horrible cave and answered as best I could. Given my fevered state. The agent made notes on my little handheld pneumatic turbo notepad have ingenious design, I often find myself wondering why they never caught on. These days you were lucky to find on a jumble sale or in a drunk shop. Lucky a spell if all the notes made on it is still readable. When Christopher Plummer had finished interrogating me in his strangely stiff manner, he depressed a knob on the turbo notepad and with a surprisingly loud hiss it clunked into hibernation mode. I watched the jet of escaping steam. Years later, sitting in a cafe in a tremendous town, flicking idly through an intelligence journal. I learned that agent plumber had been exposed as a as an alien life form from some faraway planet riddled with horrible caves. I thought how fortunate we were to have only one horrible cave, terrible as it was. Last week, I hiked out that way to see if my signpost was still where. prancing majestically along the path, I encountered dozens of terrified people being attacked by cows. Sorry, that was a typing error. I should have said terrified people being attacked by crows. One poor read, who had been pecked at was slumped beside his makeshift tent. fruitlessly trying to wrap a bandage around his head. I knelt down beside him, and gave him a hand and could not resist asking what was happening, but he was unable to speak. I surmised, however, that the crows must have flown from the direction of the horrible cave, perhaps a nested there, unbeknown to the local bird inspectors. It seemed like a good idea to forget about my signpost for the day, and to go to the headquarters of the bird inspection team instead. So that's what I did. Although it was at least 14 years, since the last I had roamed these parts, I still record the bus routes. So after making sure the perfect man's head bandage was not too tight, I changed direction and cut across the malls towards the bus stop.

Frank Key  23:02
It was a dismaying sight for the shelter was in ruins, and the glass behind which the timetable had been pinned up was smashed, and the timetable itself torn to shreds. Further evidence of violent crime activity as if anyone needed. The bus pulled up at this dismal scene. A few minutes later, I clambered on board and became somewhat uneasy to discover that I was the only passenger. Was this going to become one of those frightening journeys, where the driver would turn to look at me, and I would see that he was a fiend in human form, Catherine hideously as the bus hurtle to perdition. I had forgotten that it was St. Eustace his day, and that most people except for me and the bus driver, and the people being attacked by crows would be staying indoors in darkness behind fastened shutters, imploring the site to keep them safe from poisoned air for the coming 12 months. I hope that the bird inspection headquarters would at least have a skeleton staff on this special day and settled back in my seat, thinking to take a nap while the driver steered his bus around the many dangerous corners on the route. When will I ever learn? No sooner had I closed my eyes? Then the bus brake sharply jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed for which I reprimanded him. He apologized for his router. He then pointed in front of him and I saw that the road was blocked by a fanatical preacher man, naked from the waist up, caked in filth standing on a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had never heard before. The driver of it Strange looks of befuddlement. Then he reached under his seat and hoisted up a rectangular tin which he opened to reveal clotted massive style food. He invited me to share his lunch, but I declined, given that there appeared to be a number of weevils crawling about in it. Their presence did not bother the driver, who began shoveling the food into his mouth with his surprisingly dainty fingers. I noticed that his nails were painted with bright red lacquer flaking off in places as if it had been applied some time ago, his eating habit, his eating habits were so repulsive, that I turned to look out at the preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now. I decided to get off the bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side of the road. As I got close to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was mistaken. But no, there was no doubting it. underneath all the caked mark. I recognized my papaya. Papaya I cried, sudden tears streaming down my face. I may as well have been invisible. He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky in his unintelligible tongue, the sky that was now growing black as monstrous clouds swept in from the west. I am tempted to lie and say that my tears were copious, but I have to confess they were not. I sniffled a bit and then remembered why I had gone off the bus in the first place. It was clear to me, however, that asking my papaw to shift his barrel out of the road would be futile. I wondered how it would be if I just pushed him over and clear the way myself. The rules here on toppling preacher man a draconian and I would have to make sure I did not get caught. I judge the bus driver was too intent on bolting his food would not be paying attention. If he saw me push my power off the barrel, he would almost certainly inform on me, for we all knew the reputation reputation of bus company personnel hand in hand with the police force, at least in this neck of the woods for obvious historical reasons. As for why Paul would he lay an accusation against his only son, it was a risk I had to take. Just as I was nerving myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a mordant fancy which had been nestling dormant in my brain until that moment, I am utterly perplexed as to why I suddenly uncoiled itself as it were, and sprang to the forefront of my mind,

casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision, so very vivid of myself, dressed in rags is exhaustedly swinging a leper Bell from my withered arm. And moving the story at that exciting point, with the narrator dressed in rags exhaustedly swinging a leper Bell from his withered arm. That's the end of this week's show. I think we'll take up the story. Next week. It's called the horrible cave. And it's full of thrills. And it's entirely autobiographical. There hasn't been time to discuss knitting with pansy cradle drew this week, but perhaps Next week, we'll be able to remedy that and possibly devote 28 and a half minutes of the show to a knitting discussion with a little bit of the horrible cave thrown in Bye bye.
