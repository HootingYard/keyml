Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air and my name is Frank a very nice to be doing a program in daylight. That hasn't happened for a while. But it's daylight might even still be daylight at the end of the show. And in the middle years of the 19th century, for about 12 or 13 years, there was a magazine called the zoast, a journal of cerebral physiology and mesmerism and their applications to human welfare. It's entirely possible actually that the magazine might have been called the zoologist. I'm not entirely sure whether it's voiced or czarist, I prefer voiced anyway. Here is a Here is a brief extract from number 51 October 1855. spasms, cramps are an affection to which almost all sensitives are especially inclined, many, especially those of a higher degree suffer from them severely. They formed the last term of the series, stomachache, headache, fainting spasm. They may be occasioned by magnets by terrestrial magnetism by poles of crystals by a morphus unit polar bodies either odo positive or odo negative by human odac poles by the prismatic rays of either the solar or Lunar spectrum, particularly the green raise, by down passes, but often by up passes by charging and conduction, whether immediate or approximative by the mere odjick atmosphere, by the psychical action of insult, grief, anxiety, fear, annoyance, jealousy, quarrels, mental exertion, joy, or even dreams. They are most conspicuous in the extremities, solar plexus and head, they can be artificially excited and calmed or depart naturally, they often follow a tolerably similar course from the toes through the abdomen to the brain, and then down the spinal cord, like a path. In most cases, they can be more or less easily calmed by down passes. Hence, as they are essentially related to sensitiveness and immediately dependent on odac motions, they undoubtedly belong to the domain of odd.

That's the domain of old Eau de, not the anyway, on Monday, the Monday just gone. I posted on the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org the following little item should be self explanatory. The time is right I think to flex my ornithological chops by setting a daily bird related challenge. By doing so, I hope to silence forever those fiends who matter darkly that actually Mr. Key is a complete ignoramus in matters avian. It is astonishing. Is it not that such Brickbats can be thrown yet they are with distressing regularity? Well, let us see how a birdie Knowles deal with the first of these challenges. Your task, which you must accept on pain of Aubree and Kim cam is booted and with your bird spotters book tucked into the pocket of your rainwear to locate and identify the following birds, as mentioned in slouching towards Kalamazoo by Peter devries, 1983 and I quote, that there is no Bluebird of happiness. Only the Robin have resigned acceptance of things as they are the plain everyday styling of common undiluted reality. And then what next, that grackle of total disillusionment unquote. So there are four birds to spot and submit. Well, no ordinary bluebirds, nor Robin's nor starlings nor grackles, mind. And once spotted, you must execute pencil or crayon sketches of each and post them all links to them in the comment carton. Off you go. So that appeared on the website on Monday and yesterday Wednesday I received the following letter from Tim thurn oe fk, he began in his usual, artless manner. I am appalled at the latest evidence of your slipshod treatment of your loyal readers. I very much welcome the daily bird challenge instituted here on Monday, and I was even preparing to acknowledge that perhaps you do know a little bit about ontological matters or not, and are not a hopeless avian dumb cop. As I have always suspected. I threw myself heart and soul into the first of your challenges removing my binoculars from the satchel were in they have been gathering dust since the last century, and stalking up and down and around my bailiwick hoping to spot a bluebird and a Robin and a Starling and a grackle I took a bag of reconstituted meat paste sandwiches, and a flask of piping hot tea, because I was in this for the long haul, and I could see myself being stranded on a hillside come dusk. I even had a picnic blankets thrown over my shoulder, just in case. I spent the whole bloody day in the open air. In spite of the weather, though I would have liked nothing better than to be curled up on a rug in front of a roaring fire, like a well kept dog. Now, perhaps it's my own fault that I failed to check the noticeboard outside the Civic Hall, and thus was unaware that Monday had been designated and no birds sing day by the authorities. In honor of some elite ailing Paoli loitering night at Arms of yesteryear. Clearly, the birds they're tweeting and chirping for bad voted with their wings and scarpered to a different neighborhood for the date. That is why I failed to spot any birds at all, let alone the ones designated in your challenge. But I repeat, I put a great deal of effort into it at some risk to my holistic well being, for I suffered march, march, until I eventually threw in the towel towards midnight and staggered home in a state of mental and corporeal exhaustion. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I was impugned by a peasant while trudging around the lake upon which even the sedge was withered.

I slept in fits and starts having hideous dreams about eggs and monkeys. But when I rose on Tuesday and plunged my head into a bucket of ice water, I consoled myself that the day would bring a new bird challenge. I resolved to be better prepared. And before dawn, I took a little hike over to the Civic hall to check the noticeboard for any further bird related announcements. There Were None. But to be on the safe side, I popped into old Park kropotkin bleach and fags and periodicals kiosk to pick up the local newspaper. Back home before caulk Crow, I read this particular Bailey which daily intelligence front to back line by line twice over a breakfast of goat milk swaps. I did not want to repeat it yesterday with its crushing humiliations. So I meant to be absolutely sure I was apprised of all personnel from local owners or logical goings on before I took the daily hooting yard bird challenge. There was much to take in for the intelligence it was packed with special reports from it. Tip Top bird reporter young diago Bert Starling, whom I had had the pleasure of meeting a couple of times as he scampered around the baileywick with his reporters pad and propelling pencil there on page one with his take on the success or otherwise of and no birds sing day. Apparently a Crone on Rolf Harris Avenue had failed to muffle her Sandpiper, while an avant garde artist at the Conservatoire had insisted on rehearsing his pasa Kalia for three electronically enhanced buffleheads both Crone and composer would it be shot at dawn I learned and in fact, in the distance, I heard the firing squad. Turning to page two starlin had a piece about our For which I could read no sense, since he had written it aping the style of Terry Eagleton. The next few pages were taken up with the dismal and the mundane. I was looking for announcements and pronouncements about birdie hue and eventually found some on the inside back page. Today, Tuesday, I learned there was to be an ostrich display in the park, the unveiling of a 10 blue footed boobie statue in the market square. Some flummery with birdseed and tea strainers at the Opera House annex, and according to dagobert styling, the expected appearance in the sky have an enormous flock of migrating swallows a flock so enormous it would blot out the sun. On the back page, there was a small light of a batter Siskin and attractive little Finch caged and to be presented as a prize to the orphanages often of the month, spooning the last of my goat milk slops down my gullet. I was well pleased and confident that I was as prepared as ever I could be for today's bird challenge. Inside the techno heart, I depress the computer knob which began the process of powering up my macro hard VISTA operating system. In just a few hours now, I would be plugged into the information superhighway of which Mr. Blair had spoken with such enthusiasm. It seems so long ago, that bright new dawn when things could only get better, I could barely remember whether it was before or after Peter Mandelson sported a dapper moustache, and which guide dog accompany David Blunkett at the time, thinking these thoughts with time to kill and savoring the goatee residue coating my tongue, I strode manfully over to the town gymnasium, to throw medicine balls around to no apparent purpose, and to spend a while on the simulated bobsleighing machine at the corner, as luck would have it, I bumped into young Daigo Bert Starling, but he was in a frantic hurry rushing to some newsworthy incident of which I would no doubt read in tomorrow's paper.

pt darlin puffed out, not unlike a magic dragon. I returned to the heart and was pleased to see steam hissing from the I ears of the computer, a sure sign that only a few minutes remained before it booting up would be complete. I was already booted Of course, and in anticipation of the challenge to come had changed into my dappled done suburban rambling fatigues. I sat at the console and waited for the Brian ino pop. As soon as it popped, I logged in to what our Belgian chums called head internet and stared my waiter hooting yard. What did I find a picture of Rolf Harris never unwelcome but have no ornithological interest, some drivel about Whittaker chambers and Alger Hiss. The mentioned twice of certain swooping birds of the air momentarily sparked my interest, but no challenge was laid down to the reader. So I spat into my spittoon and moved on 19th century twaddle about mesmerism followed by a blather about soup. And, and nothing else. No daily bird challenge for Tuesday. This key is what I mean when I rebuke you for being slipshod and abusing the devotion sometimes fanatical of your readers and listeners. It's become quite clear that you know not a lot about ornithology. But I'm now forced to ask if you actually understand what the word daily means. The newspaper I pulled over with beetle browed concentration is this particular Bailey which daily Intelligencer has the significance of that title occurred to you. It signals even to a half wit that the paper comes out every day, not just now on then, not just on rainy days, not just when young Daigo birth style in it Tip Top bird reporter can be bothered to clamber out of a better morning and armed himself with his reporters pad and propelling pencil and charge with the vigor of youth through the streets and fields keeping his eyes peeled for all manner of birdie activity. Know the paper that appears on old Park kropotkin kiosk counter and on other counters and on shelves and racks and tourney display carousels every single day of the year. Except of course for important festive holidays when everything shuts down. I speak of days, such as the anniversary of the Hindenburg disaster, and Yoko Ono's birthday, but otherwise, daily means every day. How in the name of the printer lecture of tantaran can you claim as much for your so called daily bird challenge? It appeared once and then the very next day it was gone, puffed, vanished in the haze, like that conjuring trick with the magnet and the whisk and the attractive little cage sit again, which I have been practicing in my leisure hours. I am surely not the only reader and listener to find myself sorely tested by your Cavalier ways, Mr. Key, why don't you just come clean and admit that what little you know of birds could be written in very big bold block capitals on a pinhead and the head of a tiny tiny pin that not one of the bigger ones you find in shops for the larger payment pointy thing user. Were you to confess as much Believe me, you would feel refreshed as if washed in the blood of the lamb and wrapped in a towel of unimaginable floppiness. If I will not drew back at the gymnasium in a few minutes to put all the medicine balls back in their cupboard and to tweak and grease the simulated bobsleighing machine in readiness for the orphans simulated Bobs like Cup tie needle match tomorrow, I would happily draft a mayor culpa for you with vivid and sprightly wording you could be proud of as it is, I and the rest of your despicably ill treated readers and listeners will have no choice but to entrust you to do the decent thing. Yours more in sorrow than in anger. Well, in truth boiling with rage, and mine did a strangle a few hens to assuage my fury. Tim thurn

Mr. Key would like it to be known and not just known but shouted from top tours and prominent Harry's that he has no intention of writing any such confession of avian ignorance now or at any time in the future. For he knows all there is to know about birds from the Arabian babbler to the barn owl to the carrion Crow, to the dotterel to the Egyptian goose, to the former to the Goliath Heron to the hupo. To the Indigo bunting, to the jack door to the kitty, wake to the little stint to the more hen to the night jar to the Oriental praten coal to the pin tailed snipe to cats out coaction or be it a mythical serpent, but with feathers with feathers like a bird to the ruddy shelduck to the songbird, htet to the Twilight, to the upland Sandpiper, to the viri to the wimp roll to the yellow bellied sapsucker. Yay and to xenos petrol Shame on you, Timothy, burn Shame on you. Next year we'll be telling me there is a bird beginning with x. There is not

one of the pieces mentioned in that that appeared on Tuesday on hooting yard was a story about what it could chambers around your house. It's the third episode in our series in which important important series of events from American 20th century history are revisited. By hooting yard and given a kind of reimagined, although of course, all of the information contained is entirely factual. This is the third one it's called chambers on hiss at the pumpkin patch. In Maryland, Whittaker chambers pointed across the fields towards his pumpkin patch. Beside him. Alger Hiss peered uncertainly through the morning mist. There his said chambers you can see my pumpkin patch barely chambers barely. It is a misty morning said his let us go then you and I said chambers. Unlike the shabby Whittaker chambers, Alger Hiss was dressed elegantly and he worried that his expensive shoes would become caked with the merry land mud through which Perforce he must squelch to reach the pumpkin patch. I am worried that my expensive shoes will become caked in mud chambers, he said. Oh, don't you worry your little hiss head about that said chambers. It is wooden mud that is mud cleverly carved from wood to give the appearance of mud. Your expensive shoes will remain clean and shiny, or My name is not Whittaker chambers. or indeed, George Crosley said his dammit his his chambers rounding on his alleged power. Don't speak the name I use when spying for the Soviets. Even here in this rustic neck of Maryland. Remember that our capitalist government has agents fanned out across the land. Why even that scarecrow over there may be made of more than straw. It may contain wires and a radio transmitter in its noggin. Sorry chambers. You are right of course, said his. The pair stocked across the wooden mud which Whittaker chambers had laid to surround his pumpkin patch for security reasons. As they walked arm in arm chambers explained to his how one of the pumpkins had been hollowed out so that top secret micro film could be hidden inside it. Are you not worried asked hiss that the micro fill might be rendered useless on account of chance knowing by small scavenging animals such as squirrels or field mice or raccoons, or indeed certain swooping birds of the air chambers. Well, his said chambers I have quite enough to fret about with the lamentable state of my rotten teeth and my stained and shabby suit, not to mention my many illicit homosexual encounters up and down the eastern seaboard. I trust in Starling to protect my top secret micro film from the predations of squirrels etc. algea here's one that exactly how starlin far far away in the Kremlin could protect a Maryland pumpkin patch, but he said nothing. After all, who was he to question the omnipotent wisdom and ideological genius of the pockmarked party leader. The two alleged chums arrived at the pumpkin patch. Now, see if you can spot the hollowed out pumpkin his said chambers. But but they all look almost identical chambers said his that his is the beauty of my scheme, replied chambers. A few yards from where they stood a federal agency radio transmitter hidden in the head of a scarecrow spotted and bounced far away in Langley, Virginia. an operative snapped to attention and clamped his headphones tighter against his pencil poised he was ready to transcribe what he heard. But he heard only the sound of knowing as a squirrel, or possibly a field mouth, or a raccoon, or a certain swooping bird of the air targets fangs or beak into the wiring. In Maryland, where the chambers and Alger Hiss stood in the morning mist in the pumpkin patch, pointing that pumpkins and plotting the overthrow of the capitalist system.

When I was young, I was keen to study the fantastic architecture of the burning cities. I enrolled in a college run according to blots minist principles. We were taught to build scale models of the more outlandish buildings from paper and cardboard and GM, and to set fire to them and watch them burn keeping a safe distance. view through heavy duty Hector scopes from behind the potted begonias and chrysanthemums in our workroom, the effect was astonishing. One could imagine oneself standing, windswept upon the tour watching from that high peak with its glistening near the city in flames far below. When it was reduced to ashes and dust, what then? What then? Had we really been upon the tour? We would have no city to return to. As the smoke dispersed? Would we have trooped down the far side of the tour and set out the new undiscovered land to build and burn and you? pimply students. We need not risk such adventure. We took our brooms and dustpans and swept up the ashes and then we left the workroom laughing and babbling heading across the lawn with its glistening pond for the cafeteria. As we gobbled and drank, the college janitor locked up his cupboard, hung his keys on the hook in the porch and took the bus to the foot of the tour. up he trudged to the top, and he sat by the glistening mirror and looked upon the city, and he wept.
