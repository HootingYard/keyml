Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank k and this is hooting out on the air. I still got the head cold and hacking cough that I had last week. So there may be a few interruptions normal programming while I have a hacking cough and ride about. This is a special edition of hooting out on the air as is next week's show. And probably the week after that as well, because I'm going to read to you obsequies for last tauk struck by lightning. This is a lengthy piece, which was published by the hooting yard press in 1994 17 years ago in an edition of 25 copies, and has never been reprinted. And the text hasn't even appeared on online on the hooting yard website. Excuse me. Although there are plans to possibly republish it later this year. However, I've never seen the light of day for 17 years apart from a small extract. And I'm going to read the entire thing to you. And it will take at least this weekend, next week show and possibly the week after as well. One word of warning for any Finnish listeners or Finnish speaking listeners. There are many words in Finnish in this story. And I don't actually speak Finnish. And I'm not sure why on earth 17 years ago, I decided to put lots of Finnish words into the story, but I did from a dictionary. And I might pronounce them completely inaccurately. So if I do just bear with me, and send me a kind of note telling me the correct pronunciation or something. Anyway, it's split into chapters. So we'll have a little bit of the Caucasian lullaby between chapters, but this is obsequies for last talc, struck by lightning. Chapter one. last talk was passing along the avenue act on his way to a certain scientific or medical club founded by a philanthropist, which he had succeeded in joining by dint of intrigue. He knew that at noon, at the close of the meeting, each member after drawing lots would be given a reconnoitering trail to follow, baited with an interesting prize. He had last taken part in this escapade the previous month, stormy June, and still kept tucked in his blazer pocket the prize he had managed to track down during 11 excruciating days. The philanthropist himself was unable to distribute the prize trails as he was plagued with wit, clothes and other complaints. Indeed, he rarely attended the meetings anymore, and when he did, he crouched in the darkest corner of the chamber sucking boiled sweets and tugging at his matted hair. He had assigned the job of presiding over the meetings and handing out the reconnoitering trails to his assistant bude. bukh, was astonishingly tall, almost a freak and wore a cardboard hat, which he covered with cellophane during rainstorms. ignorant of science and medicine and virtually everything else. He was nonetheless mastery is the club's president for reasons which will become apparent. What else is there to say about him for the present? His eyes were different colors. Violet and puce. He was fond of badges. He had once pole voltage for his country and won a medal. Bear in mind that this story is set in Finland.

The scientific medical club, its exact name is unknown, had been established by the philanthropist 12 years ago. It met on the second Tuesday of every month in chambers led by a circus impresario usually the members would gather in the outer room cold and pokey and crammed with a bewildering agglomeration of worm eaten furniture. There were so many chairs tables, chaise Long's escritores bureaus tall boys umbrella stands reliquaries, trestles musnad, pallet bracket, hammock bins, easels, divan, dressers, wardrobes and bunks in the room, all of them ready to crumble to dust that the 11 members of the club haplessly wedged between cots and benches as they sit there tumblers of huge let out yelps of Glee, when at last bukh unlatch the door of the inner chamber and admitted them to the meeting room. This was more spacious, though colder, and virtually empty of furnishings safer a dozen exquisitely comfortable armchairs, a small side table, a display cabinet and a lectern. Finished timber burned in the great, but buke insisted on throwing all the windows open. The room was cold even at the height of summer with certain architectural niceties, air draft and the northern climate. The members sank into their armchairs. bukh handed out the agenda and the meeting began. Last month, hairgrass had delivered his paper on musk Scotty nutmeg, as ever he was puckish. When his talk was done. His colleagues fired questions at him raised objections made sarcastic comment suggested texts for further reading, and we're in the throes of a fulsome discussion. When BJU grows from his chair, armed himself with a married bang the team gone and silence them at a stroke. Now, no one spoke except the president in RAM staccato vieweg. Wrapped out the club's business correspondence sent and received financial matters topics for future papers complaint, bile, the usual concerns of any small club, the enormous wooden clock nailed askew above the fireplace struck noon, the time had come to hand out the reconnoitering trails. before passing on to this most enthralling aspect of beauty office. A few words should be said about the subjects upon which the club members exercised their mind. In its early days, when the founding philanthropist was still active. The club had been entirely scientifico Medical in its concerns, as our members left through boredom, maladies death, or in one celebrated case to join a cane gang and were replaced with new blood. The club's character changed slowly and subtly. Topics drawn from a wider trough would engage the members of tension sat in timid a tea and dust had each been the subject of a specialist paper, as had concubine edge buttons, croup, oars and piety. Beauty influence should not be underestimated. After all, he alone would suggest topics for investigation. And it's not too much to say that the various subjects to which the club turned his attentions were a map of the president of mental life. Occasionally, his research by proxy had a more practical application. buke had long been embroiled in a dispute with his landlord and farsighted as ever decided that a knowledge of firearms would be useful. He suggested the topic to the club on an unexpectedly hot Tuesday in December, confident that one of the members would spend months boning up on the subject. And so it was the beginning of our story as he pranced along the avenue ACC last touts brain was primed with the paper he planned to deliver upon musketry and Puma colitis in Finnish. Luckily, we have his notes and the talk he never gave can be reconstructed up to a point. Ah, but last forever the tambour of his voice, the killing economy of his gestures, the sweep of his ad lib a dender.

I have referred to reconnoitering trails, a dry phrase and one which does not do justice to the fiendishly exquisite and exquisitely fiendish penciled diagrams, executed on waterbath paper and inserted in formidable Maroon envelopes upon which buke toiled so hard. Let us call them treasure maps for that is what they were to each envelope was gambling, labor. problem which buke had written the name of a common farmyard implement 11 in all, one for each member of the club. The same words were inscribed on folded triangles of custard paper which bukh carried in a small gunny sack. At noon. At the close of each meeting, the members would form a line before the president in strict alphabetical order by surname and in turn, pluck a triangle from the sack. This done, the envelopes would be distributed. Each member was now in possession of the clues which would lead them to a fascinating prize. Last month having picked Keanu a turn from the gunny sack, last talc was given his envelope and immediately scurried home to open it in the privacy of his booth, voir. This room, incidentally, is worth describing in some detail, so garish where it's accoutrements, but that will have to be the subject of a separate work to do it any justice. On the afternoon of the second Tuesday in June, talc opened his envelope and unfolded a huge sheet of waterbath paper, its complexities deceit him, he had to sit down and knock back the best part of a bottle of Ivory Coast pink before he could even begin to examine buchs dastardly handiwork. It was at once a map on a manuscript, a web and the whirly gig. talc gazed at it for hours. Oh, so futile to try to unravel its mysteries while flopped on a Davenport. draining the flask he hurriedly packed a volleys scribbled a note the mini Hail the taxi barge through the crowds at the railway station jumped the queue at the ticket office scrambled the very last second onto the train leaving from platform 11 sank panting into a seat in the dining car, ordered a magnificent and typically finished concoction of poached egg mustard and cauliflower, let out a mighty sigh and patting the maroon envelope in his pocket.

A packet steamer foisted some banknotes into the person's filthy hand, found his way to a cabin, tossed his volleys into the corner, lay down on his bunk and unscrewing the top of another bottle of pink drank himself into oblivion. It was now late afternoon on Friday, just over 72 hours since he had opened buke turn envelope

obsequies for last calc struck by lightning chapter two. It is a curious fact that throughout his long life, last hour extremes had only ever been sweet, even tweet. He'd never experienced a nightmare. We know this because he wrote about it at length in his book, the brink of cramp and other essays. As the pig battery steamed south, he dreamed again of fragrant Petunia decked meadows, gambling bunny rabbit, miraculous angels plucking on harps pretty balloons sandcastles blissful dawns, how nauseating he thundered in his essay to be held wrapped night after night after night by visions, so sickly, sentimental, and yet in sleep to relish them to feel such exaltation at images which in my waking life, I a thin and intellect ju Li, a man of the world would castigate as the contemptible pole pruners of babes and cretins. I have come to have the greatest doubts about myself. He continued. I have teetered on the edge on the verge of spiritual despair. He tried everything in hopeless attempts to induce nightmares. He abandoned his comfortable bed for a pallet of straw. He drank to excess or drank nothing at all. He burned sulfur in his bedroom. Upon retiring, he ate the most noxious cheese's he could lay his hands on. He read terrifying stories of violence, horror, and Whoa, nothing worked. And eventually, in his 70s, he surrendered, accepted his namby pamby dream world, and found the kind of peace. I came to terms with myself, he wrote, I was forced to concede that within my very soul, in that secret world of dreams were in lies the engine of our being. I liked nothing better than to frolic in a sun clashed garden with kitty cats and puppy dogs. I was I realized, a simple minded holmboe A Hulu word. Within hours, the pig battery reached the eyelid at which talc disembarked. One of the crew took him to shore and a powerful motorboat, then swam back to the packet steamer. Once he had conducted his business task was to roll that turn alone to Marseille in the motorboat and leave it in the safekeeping of the captain's nephew. A small curdled lad who ground bones to Dustin the Naval Hospital. The pig battery steamed off South bound for the Antarctic. Making sure the motorboat was securely tied to a post talc checked beauty map. This must be the place to is right, a clump of Bracken taze left a post office straight ahead a well, this last was what he thought. As he approached it however, a woman sprang out at him brandishing alarms. She was beribboned and festooned with braids, and wore a terrifying mask of 10 and gold. Tout stopped in his tracks. I am the captain of the well she announced this Lance is tipped with venom. So be very careful. What business have you here? I have come from Finland said talc have any other things been here recently? I asked the questions she wrapped and shook her lungs. I have reason to believe that a thin a very tall fin has secreted at the bottom of your well a little packet I have come to collected. Do you wish to go to the toilet? she asked. Not at the moment. I asked because our island is blessed with three toilets. One of them is just behind the post office over there. She waved her alarms appropriately. That is the big toilet. It's the one most popular with foreigners. Perhaps because it's so close to the beach. The proper foreigners toilet is on the other side of the eyelid. Not far it takes only a few minutes to walk there. We prefer foreigners to use that one hence its name.

Frank Key  18:22
And where is the third toilet? asked talc feigning interest. Wait, wait, I told you it is I who asked the questions. If you are patient, I will tell you about the third toilet. But I have yet to finish telling you about the foreigners toilet. This poison lounge belies the fact that we are welcoming people on this island. So we let visitors use the big toilet if they wish to. Even though we would prefer them to use the foreigners toilet, outside which is a signboard on which the word toilet is written in every language used on Earth, including some of the dead ones. It must be a big board. Everyone on this island has very small writing but yes, the board is gigantic. And now I will tell you about the third toilet. It is at a midpoint between the other two surrounded by tungsten railings. For that reason. We call it the tungsten toilet. Although there were a few recalcitrants, who called it the puter toilet because the toilet itself is made of pewter. I say they were summarily executed. Who, for the umpteenth time, do not question me. I was about to tell you. The recalcitrants were executed by me with my Lance. The captain of the well held belongs to talc throat, reminding him of his peril. Well, he mumbled. I don't want to go to the toilet at the moment but thank you for the information. I have not finished telling you about the tungsten toilet it may have For you to know why it is protected by railings. I think I'd rather investigate the well. So be it. Here is a little map showing you how to get to the foreigners toilet should you need to visit it during your stay. There is a little box outside for donations. If you have any trinket or Google's in your pocket, the people of the eyelid would be grateful. And with that, the captain of the wells stole away towards the clump of Bracken. She was soon out of sight. Last out, sat down on a little bench next to the well and studied Buse instructions. The clues were stupendously complicated, written in a kind of Earth finish, replete with puns across sticks and micpa grams and accompanied by diagrams, charts, illustrations and emblems, often miniscule and all executed with beauty ferocious cross hatching for which to use an especially scratchy nib during his three days or nights to train, touted, pored over this first stage of the trail marsay was obvious once you'd gain some insight into the workings of buchs brain. But talc was in northern Italy before he had worked out what to do next. At last he had realized that that little grid of chocolate colored letters hemmed in by inky curlicues directed him to this eyelid so tiny it was found in only the rarest of atlases. The train was in the outskirts of Marseille before talc. His cranium fuming eventually worked out that beauty was leading him to a well upon the island, at the bottom of which he would find a packet the packet itself containing further clues, without which the remainder of the trail would remain forever unintelligible the prize for ever out of his grasp. The bucket was resting at the bottom of the well. He raised it with much clanking, the train was rusty. The bucket came to the top brimming with water. On the underside of the bucket bugle one of his henchmen had taped a waterproof packet emblazoned with a picture of a turn. talc tore it from the bucket and without pausing to open it hurry to the boat, and most of back to Marcy at top speed, accidentally killing a stray Morehead in the process. When he opened the packet, as he Ghazal the flag of Grogan, the power of the French seaports most elegant dancehall, he found buke clue to be uncharacteristically simple. Go to the foreigners toilet it read in the system, you will find a packet containing the next clue. You wreck buke you Kalyan tout gloss the day recovering the second packet and felt duty bound to leave a bobble in the donation box. By the time he was back in Finland. It was Wednesday evening, and he was exhausted. And according to a simple little footnote, he had just managed to decipher he had only two and a half days until noon on the following Saturday to track down his prize.

That's that that was the end of chapter two of obstacles for last talk struck by lightning. There's still about five minutes left of the show, but I don't really want to start reading chapter three and then have to interrupt it. So we'll carry on with that next week. And what In the meantime, up until seven o'clock. I will babble. In fact, I will babble and also we may be able to do an impromptu rendition of the hooting yars can't which we could do, and we'll do that. But I should mention while I've been fit. Okay, let's do the hooting yard chant. hooting yard, hooting yard, haha and gazebo. We will vanquish all of those Where have all the flowers gone. hooting, hooting God and we might even do that again before the show is out. Thank you very much to Miss dimity cashew for joining in there. And, yes, go to the hooting yard website. hooting yard.org and you can read thousands upon thousands upon thousands of words, but not obstacles for last talc. You can buy some books. I think, Miss dimity cashew has something to say. I did. I did. While we were on the subject of obsequies for those talc astute listeners may have noticed that Lars talc narrowly avoided hitting a more head when he was heading in the speedboat off the coast of marsay. As I said, astute listeners may be aware that more hands aren't usually found off the coast of Marcee, or indeed even in salt water. What? What does this say about Lara's talc and his adventures? Think about that. What it says actually, is that my grasp of Ornithology has progressed by leaps and bounds in the succeeding 17 years. One thing you might be interested in on the hooting God website is a little play suitable for tinies so over the summer holidays, perhaps you'd like to gather the tinies or the your own tinies or neighbors and friends tinies into a little amateur dramatics group, and the play is called Well, it's got a kind of Title of the flips. Episode 94. And the you need four characters, two men, two bought or two boys and two girls. The characters are Robert Fripp, his sister, Patricia Fripp, who is a noted motivational speaker, his wife, toyah Wilcox, and Pete Sinfield, Wizard of words, who wrote the lyrics for Kim Crimson songs. Anyway, those are the four parts in the play, or play lit. And I think that would make a splendid that summer holidays activity in your back garden, to have the tinies act out that play. That would be very good. I think that's about it for this week. I don't think I've forgotten to say anything. I will continue reading obsequies for last talk struck by lightning next week. And perhaps we could end in this week's show with another rousing chorus of the hooting yard charm, which I know is a great favorite with all our listeners. hooting yard, hooting yard, haha and Zeebo. We will vanquish all our foes Where have all the flowers gone? Hootie hoo Ting? Yeah. I think that's quite enough for this week. Bye bye.
