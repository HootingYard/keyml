This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank Kay and this is hooting yard on the air. And this is a story called the sick pig. Once upon a time there was a pig. It was a sick pig. Now, in a town far away across the hills, they moved the vet. The vet had undergone many years of training in the veterinary sciences, and numerous diplomas in frames hung on the walls of his surgery. The surgery was a clean bright building in the middle of a row of slightly shabby and buildings in the center of the town far away across the hills from the sky where the sick pig ailed next to the surgery with a pie shop, and next to the pie shop with a haberdashery next to the haberdashery with the town hall annex. On the other side of the vet surgery from the pie shop was a second pie shop. And next to that with the library, and squeezed in next to that was a kiosk selling tickets to local events and entertainment. And next to that was an ironmongery. Beyond the ironmongery with the bus station. The frames in which the vets many diplomas were displayed have been made by a framer on the other side of town. One day, the vet rolled up all his diplomas and shoved them into a cardboard cylinder and waited at the bus station. He caught the number 666 to the other side of town, and gave the cylinder to the person behind the counter the framers who Shildon a receipt from a pad of receipts, and gave it to the vet who put it in his pocket. Six weeks later, the vet went to collect as many diplomas now beautifully framed, and he carried them back to his surgery on the 666 bus, and hammered nails into the wall of his surgery, and hung the frames on the nails. Now he had all his diplomas on display. If the diplomas were to be believed, the vet had demonstrated the ability to cure the ills of horses and bats, and birds and toads and cats and killer bees and shrews and weasels and ducks, and chickens and otters and badgers and field mice, and cows and bears and hamsters, and even giraffes. But not one of his diplomas had a word to say about pigs. Now the piggery person whose pig was sick upon discovering the pig sickness, tried out a number of folk remedies, old and new. He sprinkled the pigsty with Tansy and frangipani and gloxinia he went to see the Whoo hoo hoo the woman who gave him a spell to cast. He set up a loud speaker in the pigsty and played in a gadda da vida by iron butterfly over and over again. He took tips from books by Tony Buzan, but the pigs stayed sick. In fact, it got worse. The piggery person was at his wit's end. Then he remembered hearing about the vet in a town far away across the hills. Leaving the assistant piggery person in college, the piggery person set off on the long journey across the hills. On the first day, he met a man dressed all in green, who second the challenge. The piggery person bashed in the bat with a bludgeon and went on his way. On the second day, he was engulfed in a vaporous mist, and had to use his torch to find his way through it. On the third day, the man dressed all in green stood in his path again. So this time, the piggery person felled him with a goon Fang maneuver. On the fourth day, from the very top of the high hills, he saw the town nestling in the Verdun Vale below, and a gigantic mythical bird, a bit like Sinbad rock but bigger, plucked him with its talents and sold down into the town and deposited him in front of the vets surgery. The vet was out on call as an owl sanctuary. So while waiting for his return, the piggery person studied the many diplomas hanging in their frames on the walls. He was dismayed to note that not one of the diplomas and now The vet skills of curing sick pigs. He resolved not to fret but to question closely the vet upon the vet returned to his surgery.

He sat down in the waiting room and leafed through some of the Dobson pamphlets, scattered Higgledy Piggledy on the table. He became so engrossed in a pamphlet entitled, The Man Who put the bee in Beelzebub that he did not notice the vet skipping jauntily back into the surgery, even though his entrance set a bell a jangling when the piggery person looked up from the pamphlet, the vet was looming over him. It was the man dressed all in green he had twice encountered on his journey. Twice we met and twice you knocked me aside. Now here you are, where I abide run the vet in a voice high pitched, wheedling and malevolent, the piggery person shriveled in his seat. Your pig is sick, and I shall cure it, but you will have to pay a forfeit, said the vet. He pointed his long bony finger, the finger a person, and sparks flashed, and there was a puff of unexplicable rosy eight vapor when it dispersed, the seat where the piggery person had been sat shriveling, was revealed to be empty. The same moment far away across the hills at the piggery, the Assistant piggery person was flummoxed to see the sick, pig cured, cured and thriving. It grunted happily, and trotted out to scrub him in the muck. That was a big black beetle in the muck, a beetle that until an incident before I had been a piggery person.

We continue on the pig theme with the legend of the Golden pig. The circumstances in which I first heard the legend of the Golden pig is similar to those of the Sermon on the Mount, crushed in a multitude. I followed a bearded man up onto a HELOC, and sat down and listened to him speak well, more or less. There were two or three of us rather than the heaving mass of humanity. It was a flat field and not a hillock, and we did not listen to a bearded man speaking to us directly, but to the disembodied voice of a woman broadcast from a radio set perched on the back of a farmer's cart. The Voice belong to the woman of twigs. The radio set was pneumatic, and the cart belong to mad old farmer frack. It was his field we gathered in and it was partially flooded. There was no sign of the horse we assumed must have pulled the cart into the middle of the field. old farmer Frank had only one horse named Desmond. So it was likely he had let it off along the lane to the fruit and nut market. It seemed he planned to leave the cart in the field for some time, for its wheels had been removed. I had seen the cart before, so I knew that they were big wheels of Motown to wear out I guess they were being returned. There were wheels within wheels too, and it had to be assumed they were also bound for Motown. My companions and I found a patch of field relatively free of puddles, and crouched in the muck to listen to the voice of the woman of twigs. It was hard to tell whether it was a live broadcast or had been pre recorded, and the reception from the pneumatic radio set could have been better. buffeting winds howling across the flat landscape caused interference, and we had to take off our densely knit waxed woolen hats and prick up our ears. We were glad about the winds though, for they kept spinning the sails of the windmills on Pang Hill. Unlike the windmills of your mind, so memorably sung about by Rex Harrison son No, the Pang Hill windmills were proper windmills. And on days when the air was still in their sails Creek to a halt, there was something ineffably sad about them. ineffably sad to was the cracked and desolate voice of the woman of twigs, as she told the legend of the Golden pig, which was what we had come to the field to hear old farmer Frank had sent out a circular a fortnight earlier to announce this cultural event. It was a welcome interruption to the unremitting tedium of our rustic Malays as thrilling in its way as the visit of the traveling summit cinema talk. Pardon me, the traveling since in the matter graph, the previous year, when we had been treated to a showing in a different but no less sodden field of the first and second wheels of Ivan Reitman's classic picture, my super ex girlfriend.

Unknown Speaker  10:37
It was a mystery how Madeleine farmer frac found the sources to provide us with such entertainments. He appeared to spend his entire time driving his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly bellowing his he did so but obviously there was another side to him which we did not see. It was hard to imagine him brokering deals in the offices of media moguls, his huge ox like frame squashed into a tubular steel executive seating pod poring over spreadsheets. But we supposed it must be so the advanced PowerPoint presentation skills certificate nailed up on the side of the cow buyer and laminated to protect it from rainstorms was evidence that old farmer frac had an inner management pointy head, to whom he occasionally gave vent. The same could not be said of the woman of twigs, she seemed to hail from an entirely other world, remote and ancient and Savage. I once read an exciting and completely comprehensible essay, in the very difficult Journal of post modernists and penetrability entitled Pepe the pony and tweet transgressive hermeneutics in narratives of the other, hoping that I might gain some insight into the frankly bewildering nature of the woman of twigs, but I was disappointed. The last minute text or discourse had nothing in it to help me understand a weird, immensely tall Crone, draped in a burlap shift with countless twigs stuck in her mouth of matted ghost white hair. My time was not entirely wasted, however, as the essay contained an astute and devastating analysis of Rawson Marshall Thurber, his film dodgeball, which I hope to see one day if old farmer frac is able to bring the traveling cinema back to one of his fields. I was mildly perplexed that the woman of twigs had chosen not to appear in person to tell us the legend of the Golden pig. Until recently, she had been a familiar sight in our bucolic paradise, tottering about by the horse draw for standing majestic and wind swept in the middle of the Moore's certain spiteful gossips put it about that she had taken the Murdoch shilling, and was due to host a breakfast time chat show on Sky. I hope that was not true. And it indeed turned out to be a false hood, for which those responsible were tethered to a cement block on the village green and beaten with cudgels old farmer frac rented out the culturales himself, which showed yet another side to the sister surprisingly, quite surprisingly, cadila. I think I'm going to start that again, shall we, this surprisingly, kaleidoscopic, mad old man. It remained the case, however, that no one had seen hide nor hair nor twig if the woman of twigs for weeks, where she dwelt had always been unfathomable. So it was not a simple case of bashing her door down and clamping a bleeper around her ankle, as we would normally do with age solitaries. Still crouched in the field listening to the pneumatic radio blaring and crackling from old farmer fracks cart. It was good to hear her voice. I was unfamiliar with the legend of the Golden pig, and I thank my lucky stars that I was not told it when I was tiny, for it is without doubt, the most absolutely terrifying story I have ever heard.

Excuse me, here are some notes towards the history of blister line bypass. Can we decently admire a feat of engineering which led to the destruction of an owl sanctuary? The obliteration of a fairground and the destitution of a grubby yet lovable hamlet of genetically treating peasants. For some, the answer is a straightforward No, they will point to the fact and their unassailable fact that the Ballista line bypass was completely unnecessary. And in the year sentence construction, a mere handful of carts have ever been seen toiling along its grace Stalinist impactor? Yes, I meant carts, not the cars. Conversely, one might argue that owls are hardly in need of sanctuary, the fairground with a den of iniquity, and that the peasants would presumably rather be sank in popery than be sent to the salt mines. Let us not forget that owls are savage and pitted with birds of prey. Do imagine that if the tables were turned, such creatures would provide humans with a refuge. The fairground was under notorious sink vise. If we're ever to revive in young hoodies the virtues of piety and probity, such places of so called entertainment will have to be burned to the ground, roadworks or no roadworks. As for the Hamlet, it's true that the peasants hopeless hovels were smashed and destroyed during construction of the bypass. But they are free to gather the roadside and the wind and the rain. Hawking their baubles and moaning their dirt is free to to accept arms from any passing traffic, by we're not repeat sent to the salt mines, primarily because we have no salt mines in this fabulous land. The original plans drawn up for the blister line bypass are among the like loveliest drawings I have ever seen by but done in a variety of colored crayons on gigantic sheets of greaseproof paper, and have a childlike vivacity, annotated as they are with the marginal pictograms of heraldic beasts, imaginary cloud formations, and cartoonish tombstones and more Zarya. It has been suggested that the infant our quality of the drawings is due to the fact that the plans were nothing more than a wet Thursday afternoon project for the tinies of Pang Hill orphanage, and that there was never any serious intention to build the bypass at all. This is poppycock. One advantage of the barista line bypass that is often overlooked, and never Of course mentioned by the sort of fat heads who prattle on about poor fluffy ouled is that a card laden with canisters full of volatile gas or toxic sludge now has an impeccably flat level surface to trundle along. Some of us remember, when such cargos had to negotiate, twisting tracks riddled with potholes and crevices with the constant risk of toppling over? Such spillages explain why there are so many poisonous ponds and ditches riddled with mutant Toad throughout our land. It is true that such a cart will only be seen in blister lane bypass once in a blue moon. But all great advances begin with tiny steps or in this case, tiny trembles. The bypass has been celebrated in song most notably paps in trebizond local peppers opera booth, Ariadne, alpha Mac sauce and Bristol line bypass a tremendously exciting and inadvertently blood drenched production was given at the budget spinny variety theater to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first hammer blow to the head of a grubby peasant protester. To rent these brief notes here is a little quiz. How many tunnels were built under the bypass to allow safe crossing for badges, stoats and weasels? Was it a one, b 666 or C umpteen thousands ounces next week.

I've just been trying to work out what I could read for the last, or in fact, what pansy cradled you could read for the last 10 or so minutes. And I've been having a bit of a problem finding something of the right length. And I haven't prepared the program in advance, of course, which I never do. But I have found a note on pigs. We were talking about pigs earlier, golden pigs and sick pigs. And this is a great quotation from excuse me, the book of household management 1861 by Isabella beaten it Mrs. Beaten cookbook, as it's often called, but in fact, it's a book of household management. I don't know if you know that she died very, very young. This is beaten. She I think she was 31 when she died, but she managed to pack in a lot of household management before he keeled over. Yes. And I mean, why, in the in the book, we read this. From the grossness of his feeding from the larger amount of elements, he consumes his gluttonous way of eating it from his slothful habits, laziness and indulgence in sleep. The pig is particularly liable to disease, and especially indigestion, heartburn, and affections of the skin. To counteract the consequence of a violation of the physical laws, a powerful monitor in the brain of a pig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine. And how about think about that? So this is pig in a sty, and it's not well, and what Mrs Beeton is telling us is that it has a powerful monitoring its brain, which teaches it to go and get medicine wet. I mean, have you ever seen a pig walking into a clinic?

Unknown Speaker  22:33
my listeners that this is the woman who who once gave a recipe for toast sandwiches.

Frank Key  22:39
What is the recipe?

Unknown Speaker  22:41
The recipe for toast sandwiches, is that you should toast a thin slice of bread and then sandwich that between two untoasted slices of bread. And that this was a this was a suitable food for invalids along with cons me.

Frank Key  22:59
Are you sure it's toast between two slices of bread? Or is it a slice of bread between two slices of toast?

Unknown Speaker  23:08
That is a very good question. I may have got that wrong. For those of you who are trying this recipe at home. You may want to experiment with both. But it's definitely the combination of toast and and toast. Yeah.

Frank Key  23:22
And is there anything on the toast?

Unknown Speaker  23:26
toast just toast and bread?

Frank Key  23:28
Okay.

Frank Key  24:00
I'm not sure I'll have time to read the whole of this piece but someone will alert me when we're near the end or you never know it might might fit in the time. hearken ye stooped mendicant at my gate. I am good king Wenceslas and I am looking out and I can see you pour and shivering in your rags, for the snow is deep and crisp, and even. There are not even any cracks in the frozen white expanse, such as would be made by wolves or bears. Wait there, my gate Oh rec. And shortly I shall descend from my castle ramparts and join you in the snow. So said old Hallam on the feast of Steven, for he had rented a room in a castle and with getting carried away by his new surroundings. Those of you who've been paying attention will know that old Hallo was the cantankerous Training Manager of Fictional athlete Bob needs to evolve. And that's far more likely to be found puffing cigarettes at the side of a running track than loading it from the Tower of a splendid middle of the European castle. Yet here he was a battered tin crown atop this potato shaped head, pretending to be monarch of all he survived, surveyed, though all he could survive was covered in snow, including the mendicant. It was not true. However, the snow was deep and crisp, and even. It was certainly the first two. But no one could in all conscience, call it even for here and there the snow had drifted into clumps, some as high as a swan. And it was besides such a swarm sized clump that the mendicants duped now unbeknown to Al Hallam, but this mendicant was known as the natterjack man, and he was well known in the vicinity of the castle. He had empty soubriquet, because he had the face and manners of a toad, though none of the hallucinatory properties of a toad skin, which if licked, can provoke visions, depending, of course, on the type of toad. I think he's rented chambers, old Hall of straighten the crown on his head, and prized his feet into a pair of galoshes. Between these extremities, his garb or Raymond was such that we shall pass over is in silence, for we do not wish to frighten the Chinese King a lamb thorn in his grimy fist, and coughing violently. The legendary legendary athletics coach stumbled down a stone staircase impeded every few steps by the crows bats and badges whose domain this was. It was that kind of castle reaching the grand entrance all at long last toes crushed by the constricting galoshes. Old Hallo took a moment to gather himself. He was not a sentimental man, but he felt a doll Pang in his breast. As he pictured himself standing at the edge of the racetrack at hoodlums walk around rich fictional athletes, Bob Nick tavole. Would sprint round and round and round and round and round and round, unstoppable, rashly, the coach had paid six months rent in advance for his castle chamber and send Bob in it to vote off to a basket tree weaving compound hi in some distant hills, where his sprained ankle would be rested and righted. The old tyrant had not foreseen how grievously he would miss his fictional charge, nor that he would spend his castle days moping and splenetic and endlessly removing the crows which perched on his 10 crown as one perch now, coiling is in volume. Old hollub reached up and grabbed the bird by a black throat and tossed it nun to gently towards the stairwell. Then he aimed and activated his pocket pod, and the huge iron doors of the castle swung open, eerily silent. And he thumped out into the snow on the feast of Stephen.

Frank Key  28:25
I think that's all we've got time for. So, it really you know, not much else happens, actually. There's something about the natterjack man somewhere or other, but, you know, it gives you some idea of the kind of things that happen at hooting yard. If you haven't listened to the show before, I mean, it's possible that you this is the first time you've tuned in. Although in a couple of weeks, we're coming up to the 15th anniversary of the first hooting out on the air. So that will be a very exciting occasion. I may wear garbin Raymond of unspeakable type to present that show. But it doesn't matter because it's on the radio he can't see. Thank you very much to pansy crail drew for reading bits. And to Sarah who replaced john Get well soon, john. He's not well today. So thanks to Sarah for that and that's the end of the show for this week. Bye bye.
