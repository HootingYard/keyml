It is indeed time for hooting yard, and today we're celebrating the sixth anniversary. Well, six years on one day, the first episode of hooting out on the air was broadcast by resonance on the 14th of April 2004. And basically, it's been going ever since. So I thought in order to celebrate the anniversary six long, hard years, I could read, I thought I'd read something that is, in fact even older than that, which is the very first entry on the hooting yard blog at hooting yards.org, which is where it is now. But that dates back to December 2003, even longer ago. So, a bit of nostalgia, the very first entry to celebrate our sixth anniversary on air. It's the private memoirs and confessions of an ignorant ornithologist Tuesday saw something sitting in a tree. It had a head, two legs and seemed to be covered in feathers. I only saw the back of the head so could not tell if it had a beak. I suspect it may have been a linate. Wednesday, trained my powerful binoculars on a speck up in the sky in the far distance. It was moving quite fast, perhaps a rain Thursday, so a worm being dragged from the soil by something much bigger than it possibly with wings, rang Dennis to tell him about it. He said he'd come and check but by the time he arrived, puffed out 10 minutes later, the thing was gone, and there was no sign of the worm. Dennis said it was probably a cassowary. Friday overheard a couple of people in the park talking about sedge warblers later, I discovered these are a life form which all authorities agree as a type of bird ticked off a box in my notepad. Saturday went to the church fair, when I said how nice all the flags and bunting looked. Dennis said. That's also the name of a bird flags and bunting? I asked. No, you nitwit. He said just bunting. Also known as the auto land. I was very very impressed with the breadth of his knowledge. Sunday I woke up to find an owl sitting on my head.

It's not as long ago was 2003 or 2004. But it's been quite a long time since we've heard hide nor hair of Sedgwick, the truxtun ringer. Much has happened. The tapas posted bail when the ringer himself was seen scratching in line pit. Every so often he lifted thought find to the light and toss it to one side. You'd have to rent a cart or Barrow and that was where the tapas came in. They always had something with wheels to hand. They took pride in that if in Nortel's Sedgwick had his shuffle and a broom. Lord knows where he got them from. They were bent and battered as if they've been used to bash heads in. But Sedgwick wasn't a man given to lifting a finger in fury. he popped enough caps in his time, didn't have to anymore didn't want to couldn't see the point. He still spent time with authors by the river bank even when he was on his uppers. A collapsed lung was on the cards the way he was going. The physio kept giving him sideways glances and making new appointments for him. It was quite a clinic he had their white and bold and with a lawn outside with swings and a seesaw. Topper money Some said in whispers on their pumps. Wheels within wheels. That was another thing you heard in those days. It was just punter babble though. The ringer hardly heard it. He had his scratching keep him busy. Go and see him at the line pit one day he'd like that. He's a generous and open hearted man, and he'll share his flask with you likely as not. It always has something hot in it with not much milk. Sedgwick has a complicated theory about milk and calcium and bones, not any bones but his own bones. It doesn't make any sense. But it becomes him at times when he might go off funny and shaky. He can't count anymore. He has to get a tougher to count the otters now, it's come to that.

Until now, blood gets mucky proclivities have been passed over in silence by those who have written about him, myself included. Like we're so very mucky as proclivity to go. That's a contemplate them in any detail would be to shatter the brain. Lord, Bob, they were mucky. We must, I think, agree with Mr. Topping who said, quote, of all the mucky proclivities, it has been my displeasure to examine on a professional basis, those of Blodgett without doubt the muck east, unquote. Of course, there's mark and Mark, and some mark is filthier, much much filthier than other mark. in times past, there was no way of measuring the mechanics of a person's proclivities, and it's likely that they were Prato Blodgett, the McInnis of whose proclivities surpassed even his we will never know. But thanks to Mr. Topping, we're now in a position to be quite precise about the extent of the filthiness for that costume. pist has unveiled his patterned MK measuring proclivity gauge. It's a simple enough machine, so not to look at, constructed of Dobbin and wires and Bakelite and mozzie pan and rotating boosters and pig iron and cloth of gold and sticks and prongs and tin and titanium and horse wedges and cornflakes and the pips of clementines and magnetic resonating galvanized sheet metal pipes, and holds an underground and terrific flapping drapes and bleached bones from a badger and cut zinc and cementum furry funnels and cadmium and license snippety clothings and dust and modern Plasmatic plasma plasm and toothpaste tubes and reconstituted guttering and elk antlers and shoddy and beef dripping and grease and the tongues of Rennes coated in conductive fluid and misshapen nozzles and tar and more tar and febrifuge and other tar and sea water and duck pond water and boiling the lint and the twigs of a sycamore and mustard and pegs and wall and cardboard and string and tar tar again and bales of rotting straw and chicken wire and nails and bunting and calcified chemical compounds and red who do brass and oil and Chevy's and glitter and vast stained glass screens and pins and tattered mammalian webbing from Vietnam and goat horns and satin and bass British blocky Trump's have tough rubber sports and air bubbles and tar trapped in air bubbles and hazard lights and the blood of the lamb and jet knickknacks and petroleum jelly and bays and gore's and St John's wort and basals and lime and jars crammed, crammed with flakes of iron and led and catgut from tennis racquets and pus from buboes and scrapings from shelving units, and Ising glass and hair from my hand and talc and lobster pot. And Danny paint and fluorescent lanterns and paste and cracked planks and velopment grit and strontium 90 and cartridges and Toad sweat and phosphorus and adamantine and a weird sort of not adhesive glue, and great clanking trains and gorgeous perfumes and rags and plugs and sturdy tent canvas and pilings and warped fork times and batty shawls and clingfilm and batteries and giraffe hide and litmus paper and big bolts of lead and record from the Lusitania uncalibrated siphons and sponge saturated with egg white and bristly pointy bitty Bobs, and breadcrumbs and cushions, and slush and wax and throbbing electric motors and Vaseline. Mr. tappings engine has completely transformed the business of denouncing people for their mucky proclivities bloodroot included. Indeed, no sooner had Mr. Topping pushed the starter knob on his terrific machine to give it a test run.

Then bloodroot have interviewed to see what all the pallava was about, and became the very first rep to have the full extent of his mucky proclivities properly and scientifically measured. Obviously, being Blodgett he protested, and even had the gall to question the accuracy of Mr. tappings, exquisite device. But the Blodgett brow was damp with beads of sweat, and he shifted on easily in his loafers loafers which on my dad were themselves covered in filth, as if he had been wallowing in the sewers, which in all likelihood, he had been so mucky pup is he afterwards, when the pattern measuring proclivity gauge spat out its results in a handy poster sized format, so they could be photocopied many times over and posted upon notice boards throughout the photo bog and other photo boards where Blodgett might go scuffling about in pursuit of his mucky proclivities. Mr. Topping received many Pat's on the back and Three cheers were shouted for him and hats were thrown in the air to celebrate the successful launch of so useful and engine. Blodgett himself crept away as well, he might, and he headed into the deep, dense dark woods, where he found a hole and covered himself in soil and waited for nightfall when owls would awaken and hoot.

Here are some excerpts from a Wikipedia article on pigging, which were drawn to my attention by dunk snow white clover, reader and perhaps a listener. Yes, this is accomplished by inserting the pig into a pig launcher pushes along down the pipe until it reaches the receiving trap. That pig capture. There are smart pigs used to measure things, though some product can be lost when the pig is extracted. All systems must allow for the receipt of pigs at the launcher, pigs must be removed as many pigs are rented. The pig can be ejected from the barrel and operators have been severely injured when standing in front of an open pig door. The pig is shuffled up and down. Modern intelligent pigs are highly sophisticated, some smart pigs can combine technologies, the pig is unable to directly communicate with the outside world. It is therefore necessary that the pig use internal means to record its own movement during the trip. The original pigs were made from straw wrapped in wire. There are several types of pigs for cleaning. A pig has been used as a plot device. In the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever where bond disable the pig. A pig was also used as a plot device in the Tony Hillerman book, the sinister pig. Anyway, those are extracts from the piece with many ellipses, which you probably have noticed, because I may not have paused long enough. But I was struck by certain things, the inability of the pigs to communicate with the outside world. The fact that the fact that the pigs are put into a pig launcher, and I think most of all the fact that so many pigs are rented. Anyway, this led me to think of renting a pig. And in fact, things went so well. I wrote a song about it. longtime listeners will know I'm not going to sing it because I don't sing. But I'll try and do it as rhythmically as possible. I'm so happy I'm dancing a jig. Why am I happy because I rented a pig. It's a highly intelligent, modern pig. Hey, daddy. Oh, it flips my wig. When you hire a pig on a rental scheme, it can be like A pig in an op ah dream, the kind of pig st Koehler injured invent, or de Quincey perhaps if he could afford the rent. For a rented pig does not come cheap. It costs a tremendous amount to keep. There's the STI and the swell and the brain scans to pay and bales of straw bales of hay. But a modern intelligent pig is a treasure, a joy and a boon quite beyond measure. A pig is a must. A pig is the top rent one as I did from a pig hire shop.

I'd like to follow that with a quotation completely unrelated quotation. This one is from a book by Peter Lamont. And the book is called the first psychic the peculiar mystery of a notorious Victorian wizard, published in 2005. It's a biography of Daniel Douglas home, the notorious Victorian Wizard of the title, but the quotation I'd want to read you is about someone else a magician, in fact a contemporary of home magician john Henry Anderson. His native land conquered he had renamed himself the great Wizard of the north and headed south to London. JOHN Henry Anderson's magical repertoire had grown accordingly, featuring egg writing, and an incomprehensible guinea pig trick. And he started something of a trend when he had become the first magician to pull a rabbit out of a hat and unprecedented approach to advertising that scene whole towns papered with playbills announcing the most extraordinary sounding illusions, such as the grand metamorphism and wonder, or the Phoenix says, stochelo Bian. His tricks might be standard, but the language of his posters promised something quite unique. A grand ambidextrous illogical illusion, with 12 handkerchiefs into which will be introduced the enchanted loaf and learned bottle, the animated orange and the invisible pigeon. Not that anyone had the slightest idea what that was supposed to mean, any more than they would have recognized a phoenix esto cobian. But that was just the point.

hooting our anniversary show would not be not be complete without an appearance from the out of print pamphlet in Dobson. And he turns up in this next piece before reading it, just to remind you of course of the the hooting our website, we've already given you the address hooting er.org where you can read the things that I read to you on here and much else besides you can buy books you can give me donations. You should also go to the resonance website and donate to resonance to ensure that this program and all the other programs continue to turn up on your radio or listening device. Anyway. This is called hell. It's bells. The bells of Hell do not ring says theophrastus dog and they Clank and clunk eternally awfully deafeningly this is because they are battered and broken with great cracks and fissures. He adds that they are covered in mold of stinking greeny gray. There are no bells in hell we are told by pure lupus taxi for he says the clanks and clunk so the Dean of infernal machinery, engines of havoc designed to torment the damned. If there be stinking mold upon the machines. He does not say While ophcrack gibbous maintains there are precisely 10,000 bells in hell. Each of them numbered each in its own Belfry, and they are run by sinners in expiation, the bell poles in the form of vipers, which bite the center's hands and wrists each time they peel were designated Belle Dobson's pamphlet, hell, it's Belle's out of print is an attempt to untangle the contradictions in these authorities, each of which he contends has at least a grain of truth. Are there bells in hell? He asks, or are there not? If there are does a ring or does like Clank and clunk? Are there 10,000 bells or fewer or more even an infinity of bells, just as there is an infinity of pits and dungeons and ooh berliet in which the damned languish forever. The pamphlet is research for this paper, which he read aloud at a meeting of the sawdust bridge platform debating initiative on the 10th of April 1954 led him up some pretty horrible pathways, pathways more apparent, even one than the one that runs parallel to the disgusting canal, where in the vomit of generations is collected. Why is it that drunks and those with stomach disorders have habitually seen fit to throw up their guts in a canal basin at the end of a long and twisting lane far from any clinics and hostelries is a mystery Dobson never investigated, so far as we know. But he was spellbound by the bells of hell upon which he believed so much so very, very much hinged. It's a pity he never got around to writing the follow up pamphlet, held its bells and hinges upon them with lots of details of work which exists only in the form of illegible scribblings in a notebook, half of which is burned, and the remaining half smeared with a stinking greeny gray goo, which might be mold scraped from the bells of hell, but might on the other hand, just be the sort of goo that Dobson managed to attract to himself in his wanderings. God knows how.

No, for the first time, I had the odd feeling while reading that that I read that last week, and I have no idea whether I did or not. So if I did read that to you last week, think of it as a double bill or something or a treat. Anyway, this, what I'm going to follow it with I certainly haven't read before, on air, and it's a list. It's an excerpt from something. It might be a list of instructions, but I haven't been able to discover the complete document. So I've got no idea where this is from. It's a it's a list of instructions, I think. Anyway, this is the excerpt and place the head of the squirrel between the electric plates. 14. Move the goat into the adjoining room and close the shutters. 15 empties a packet of bile beans into one large glass jar seal will lead tight and shake furiously until you are weeping with sheer exhaustion. Dry your tears with a rag 16 peek through the flap to ensure the goat has not escaped 17 Koch's from the core of your being a sense of dazzling effulgent piggery pat the squirrel on the head 18 now in tone the litany of pseudo Voodoo you relations you memorized earlier 19 wrap the cravat around your neck striker dashing pose cutsem capers 20. The bricks in the hood should now be cool to the touch. Truck them one by one out of the window into the empty carpark. Make a sketch of their disposition upon the concrete using a very sharp pencil and a fresh page of your notebook 21 the brain of the squirrel or now be fully modified. Remove the electric plates with care, put them in the dustbin. 22 winch, the dustbin to the ceiling 23 past your hands, those tiny wrinkled blotchy shivering cold hands over the eel at rest upon the countertop 24 go and get the glue gun, and and that's where the documents stops. So I'm afraid that I, I know No, I know, not what it says later on. That's all Where is part of half of instruction 13 and then all the 14 to 23 and then the beginning of 24. And that's it. hope it was useful.

Finally this week, I think it's highly likely that quite a few listeners will have woken up this morning thinking to themselves. Gosh, it really is time I bought myself a map of Switzerland. As soon as I've done my ablutions and comped my breakfast, I shall head off to the cartographers bazaar to make a judicious purchase. So, it's fortunate then that I can pass on to you some very sensible advice in the matter, courtesy of that excellent Mr. Ruskin says Ruskin, the original von Keller's at this vital rice cut dish fight of 1844 is the only map of Switzerland which has ever been executed with common sense and intelligence. That is from volume to chapter 11 paragraph 215 of Ruskin's sort of autobiography pride terracotta. So this particular 1844 map is the only map of Switzerland which has ever been executed with common sense and intelligence. Lord knows there are plenty of maps of Switzerland made with foolhardiness and stupidity. And you might have gone and bought one of those. So you can notch that up as another triumph for hooting yards map procurement advisory service. And having done that, that's the end of this week's show. So I hope you've enjoyed it. Don't forget to visit the website. If you're listening to the podcast. Just send me a pound you know, just send me a pound because that's all I would ask for every from every podcast listener be marvelous. However, the podcasts won't be heard of a month yet so I have a long time to wait. Yes, bye bye
