Is Bogut plugged in and turned on, then we can begin. That Sorry, that was a brief technical announcement that wasn't meant to be broadcast. This is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM Well, it's resonance 104 point four FM if you're in London, but I discovered that if you're in Norwich 104 point four FM is BBC Radio Norfolk. So welcome to BBC Radio Norfolk listeners to Stop babbling Okay, this is called Dixon of Dock green. Dixon went to dock green. It was a small patch of grass hardly alone at the edge of the dock. The dock itself was one where huge steamers came into port from faraway lands, carrying all sorts of exotic cargo. The cargo was mostly packed into wooden crates, which were winched from ship to dock by dock hands. When it was lunchtime, the dock hand sprawled on the green the small patch of grass and prized the lids off their top of wares and unscrewed the lids from their flasks. They ate their bloater paste sandwiches and drank their tea. And while they chewed and swilled they talked to each other about the cargo they had winched ashore that morning. The wooden crate usually had lettering stencils on their sides and tops describing what the crates contained. One might read fruit gums, another giraffe brains. Leaning on a fence smoking his pipe. Dixon listened carefully to the chitchat of the doc hands. He used to be a policeman. Now he was a spy. His mission was to find out what cargo had been winch to show that morning and report back to his spymasters. His spymasters were shadowy figures, who sat behind a big desk in an unlit room in a skyscraper in town. The room was unlit, so that Dixon was unable to see them with any clarity and does recognize them and thus be able to identify them at a later date if ever questioned. Dixon could have just blundered around the dock and read the stencil lettering on all the crates, but he preferred to listen to the chat of the dock hand because he could not read. He used to be able to when he was a policeman, but he had lost the ability. One day, one September day to be precise, he had been chasing a miscreant and lost his footing and a gutter and banged his head. And after banging his head, he forgot everything he had ever known, even his own name, and where he lived and how old he was, and what he did for a living and how to read. In short, he was an amnesiac. One of the spine masters came to the clinic where Dixon had been put to disguise his identity. The spymaster, wore a mask and modified his voice with an electronic device. He offered Dixon a job doc green. This day I'm telling you about was Dixon's first day. While he was leaning against the fence, smoking his pipe and listening to the dark hand. He forgot all about this unlit room in the skyscraper and the shadow is spy masters who sent him on his mission. He became very interested in the fruit gums and giraffe brains and the winching mechanism, and he walked onto the slip to take a closer look. Sorry, he walked onto the ship to take a closer look. Dixon was still on the ship when it steamed out of port on its way to a far distant land to collect more cargo. One day, out in the middle of one of those big oceans that make up so much of the planet's surface, he received a bash on their head from a violent sailor. Then Dixon remembered everything. He remembered he was a policeman, so he tried to arrest the violent sailor for battering him on the head. But the law of the land holds no sway at sea, and the ship's captain locked him up in a cabin until they made landfall.

The first land they came to was a tiny rock. The captain and the violent sailor took Dixon by the arms and legs and shoved him off the ship onto the rock. It was almost barren in crusted with bombs. And other shellye denizens of the sea and rocks, but there was a small patch of grass. Dixon dubbed it doc green and fashioned a flag from his cravat and found a stick for a flagpole and planted his flag in the grass. And he devised a fishing rod and a bow and arrows and a desalination unit, for he was a resourceful policeman. And he rolled over his Little Kingdom, where there was never a whiff of crime for many, many years.

I recently had some shenanigans, that meant that the looting yard website, which you've now involved in is at WWW dot hooting yd.org. As I say this shenanigans made me think that it may be offline for a couple of days. But and I reported this on on the site, and then the shenanigans didn't happen. And so I could have deleted what I'd written about the possibility of it being offline. This is a really complicated way of describing something quite simple. Anyway, after that, I wrote the following. I'm pleased to report that the shenanigans such as they were has been averted. I was on the point of deleting what I had written above, when a thought popped unbidden within my brain, and my hands looming in readiness above the keyboard loomed still in midair, as if frozen in a snapshot. The thought was this. If I leave those measly words in place, could I not use them as a pretext upon which to tap out a further barrage of sensible prose. Each day, one struggles, as if through fog, or mud, or foggy mud, for ideas for things to say, for observations to make for words, to add to the teaming words already back from the keys between glugs of tea or Lemsip between staring out of the window at the sky and the clouds and the flocks of sweeping and identified birds. And sometimes it's not a struggle at all. Sometimes the words come as easily as falling off a log, as they say. 22 years ago, on the morning after the Great storm, there were more logs lying around from which one could fall having first clambered to stand upon them, then one usually finds in this Bally wick. Ordinarily, one might have to walk, walk a mile, or two or more to find a log lying on its side riddled with worms and borrowing tiny beings and grubs. But they were logs are plenty after so many trees had come crashing to the ground in the night, battered by howling wind. But perhaps I'm confusing fallen trees with logs, when they're not quite the same thing, or not at all the same thing, and I'm just displaying my ignorance of certain aspects of the world. It wouldn't be the first time I really check the accuracy of my assertions before I tap them out. And I never feel constrained to write, as that witless piece of advice has it only about what you know, have doll would that be? I mean, I don't know that much. And only yesterday, for example, I stumbled upon a reference to the German film director v. Lang. Beck. I'd never heard of it before. But something in his name appeal to me. V land with it echoes of Gothic from Charles brocton Browns novel of that name, and back, a lovely, chunky word one can spit out and its meaning of a thing tiny and evanescent and fugitive. within five minutes, I had embroidered inside my head, a majestic canon of back films about which I might hold forth, pretentiously waving my arms in dramatic gestures, the sign of your of a Cylons worth of credulous admirers. I might be wearing a beret and sporting a goatee in this little Mirage, taking language paths on a Gitane between between singing the praises of an intense black and white melodrama of selkie Demi mundanes directly by back in 1966. For me, spec was up there with Fassbender and Hertzog, as fecund as the one and as unhinged as the other, and I was ready to write a monograph about him.

Alas, a couple of minutes of research made so effortless by the interweb told me that VLAN back was not the Sydney God of my dreams, merely the director of a handful of features that sounded frankly, a tad mediocre. 22 years ago, at the time of the great storm before the interweb as we know it, it would have taken me much longer weeks, or months, or even years to track down information about VLANs back, assuming I maintained my interest or long enough to do so. My private back would have had a longer life with time to grow and develop before the disappointment of the real spec or cruded interweb speed my dream Wi Fi land spec has come and gone in minutes, become a mere mental speck in my own history, and would be swiftly forgotten. Ah, but never forgotten if I write him down, no, and never deleted. Had I been so rashes to obliterate the shenanigans I wrote. I might never found myself recalling the glorious fictional cinematic career of my mental VLAN back who has just who has as just a claim to posterity is the real one. Well, probably not all things considered. But you know what I'm saying do because I've just said it.

from German film directors to something else about Germany, in a pioneering new work of social history. dot tint focuses her bd bluestocking eye through a lawn yet, we assume upon the Festival of argumentative music at rumor. To be precise, she examines the first occasion on which the festival was broadcast over what used to be called the wireless back in those years in the first half of the 20th century. In an age of apples and pods, it can be a bit of a strain for us to imagine the excitement generated by the news that peasants in far flung hovels would be able to listen to the goings on live from olma dot 10 rights. When it was announced that the full program of concerts, workshops, provocations and shouty stuff would be broadcast, there were outbreaks of mass hysteria in the countryside. farmhands fainted in the field, hens acted weirdly in their coops, wells were poisoned, and cows became fractious. Many countryside wireless in those days were primitive pieces of kit bolted together from odds and ends of metal and wiring and Bakelite panels. The fact that as soon as one depressed the starter knob, they began to hiss and crackle, and then it is splitting shrieks made them the perfect medium for listening to the racket from Alma.

The festival that year was devised by a singularly bad tempered tonic hothead by the name of Klaus crank dot tint pen portrayed often includes to the fascinating note that quote, even the pharaohs of his tempestuous brows were themselves farrowed deeply so deep as the grave were in my friend was laid, unquote. She does not tell us who this friend might be, not even in a footnote. And I would have liked to footnote given the rest of her text is fairly riddled with them, sometimes two or three to a paid in tiny, tiny type so tiny that I've had to crack the spine of my review copy to flatten it out so that I can place it on a platen and view it through the lens of a large important industrial magnification instrument. It might be argued, it has been argued, so I would be better off Getting my eyes tested and wearing a pair of prescription spectacles or contact lenses. But why the hell should I, I see no reason to be cowed by the gradual, inevitable dilapidation of my physical self. By the relentless withering away of my senses. I fight that dereliction with every atrophying fiber of my being and where necessary with larger important industrial magnification instruments. Like dot tint, unnamed friend, I too will one day be laid in a grave as deep as the pharaohs, or rather, the secondary Pharaohs of Klaus cranks mighty brows. And until that time comes, I shall simply refuse in a booming voice to be extinguished. As the poet Dennis beer pint wrote, do not prance winsomely into that grave. Rage, rage against the something Dave, in his verse lines upon the imminent death of Dave my pet Viper. Bear pint was not yet born when the Festival of argumentative music at all, was first broadcast on primitive wireless set. One wonders how he might have tackled the commission to write us threnody for it to be set to music by one of Klaus cranks, hotchpotch of collection of composers, each outdoing the others in misanthropy and general grumpiness. Yet there's was a grumpiness of a very earnest, serious minded sort, and they wrote music to match. The lucky peasants who tuned into the wireless in their wind swept, fennel and hovels were created to such Masterworks is six bagatelles upon a windswept Fenn, land hovel by von steuben Z, the drainage ditch variations by ACH and lullaby for a cow felled by ergot poisoning by ergot. The great value of Dr. Tim's book is that she makes explicit the link between the confrontational nature of much of the music and the violent altercations between Klaus crank and the composers and the ticket sellers and the security patrols and the audience and the paramedics and the wireless engineers and the dog handlers and the piano D tuners and the rat catchers and the festival docents at olm. Not only that, but she puts it in the wider context of Uruguayan political intrigues of the time. She blindly dismisses the predictable objection that all means not even on the same continent as Uruguay, in prose that glistens like a jewel. She even appends a picture of such a jewel in the form of a mezzotint by her brother, the noted mezzotint test wrecks tent. It is one of several such mezzotints in the book, which also contains a small selection of photographs. The one I've reproduced on the hooting yard website purports to show tiny Enid Mrs. gubbins an old farmer frac listening to the broadcast of class cranks own festival Overture for cello, pots and pans and electric, chronically modified corncrake. But that can't be right, as the three of them are known never have occupied the same time and space upon this or any other planet. dot tip tend, confirms as much in a highly amusing a Rotom slip inserted into my copy of the book.

I mentioned in that piece fractious cows, and I don't know if listeners caught up with the news that David Blunkett was attacked by a cow recently. This is one of those examples when the so called real world sort of gets into sync with hooting yard because the thought of David Blunkett being attacked by a cow is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect to read or listen to on hooting yard. Anyway, moving on to more glob the Aviatrix and author of the book of Nat who has been mentioned on this program before, but more garbage just one among a number of globs of note. This ought not to surprise us after all, as he Lovecraft wrote in the thing on the doorstep, and I quote, It began with a telephone call just before midnight. I was the only one up and sleepily took down the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end, with someone trying under great difficulties to talk. As I listened, I thought I heard a sort of half liquid bubbling noise, glob glob glob, which had an old suggestion of inarticulate unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called Who is it? But the only answer was glob glob glob glob unquote. It can be sorry, it can be argued that Lovecraft glob is a repetition of a single glob matches, we accept that Edgar Allan Poe was referring to only one person when he shouted the name Reynolds repeatedly as he lay dying in the Washington College Hospital in Baltimore. Yet Lovecraft clearly indicate unintelligible word and syllable divisions, which sensible people who have their wits about them will take us hard evidence of multiple globs. One such as a glob, if we use that term to distinguish our subject from the AV actrix mod club was old mother glob. This fine upstanding Dowager was not the mother of mod glob by the way. In fact, as far as we can ascertain, our mother glob had no children. She was dubbed old mother because she was very aged at the time we learn of her existence. And because she bred moths it's easy to see how people assumed that mother to run with higher water should be pronounced to rhyme instead with brother. From such tiny presumptions can Titanic historical errors occur? Several bright and promising genealogists saw their careers ruined, their health destroyed and their lives wasted as they tried and failed to track down old mother gloves non existent progeny. had they known about her revolutionary mouth breathing program, and the attention it gained from mouth experts on two or three continents. Things may have been very different indeed. Or perhaps not. Perhaps each of these genealogists had a fatal flaw which sent them chasing phantoms. And had they not driven themselves mad with old mafa glob they would have alighted upon some other hopeless pursuit. There are many in the groves of academe. There is for example, the case of another Glub Binney glob, the man who became professor of few tiles studies at a large important University, sometimes called the senior senile grandparent of post modernism. Binney glubb. spent years and years writing incomprehensible twaddle in unreadable prose about, well, about God knows what if we knew what he was writing about, it would suggest that occasionally he was both comprehensible and readable, and he was neither ever and yet his screens with typeset and bound and published and sold and stuck upon shelves in libraries across the land. And he had his photograph taken smoking a pipe, shoulder to shoulder with a French intellectual or a Maoist psychopath, an airhead Airheads wrote falling profiles of him for the Sunday supplements. No such plaudits for the next glob in our set, the one legged Bob slay competitor Digby glob.

He was a sports mad youth who was nonetheless completely useless at everything he tried. failing at petanque, he took up ping pong. failing at ping pong, he tried vidkun sport savaged by finches, he turned to curling and fail again fail better as Beckett might say. All this time he had two legs. On his 30th birthday. Still utterly useless in all sporting events, he toppled into a ditch full of fierce biting ants, which ate most of one of his legs before he was rescued by an aunt killing patrol. Recovering in a superbly sterile clinic Digby glob researched sports he could take part in while sitting down Decided to devote his life to Bob slay in spite of the fact that he did not quite understand the point of it. for two decades, he continually crashed any Bob slay he sat in whether solo or as part of a team. What drove him on from one calamity to another? Was it perhaps revenge against the fierce biting ants which would have on him? There are those who can be spurred on by often harmful derangements, be they vengeance or jealousy, or preening vanity. Consider the crew fattest shelving can Glub convinced that when he wore one of his cravats, he might be mistaken for a young Apollo. This glob promised about the boulevards of pointy town, watching pointy towners gasp and swoon at his beauty. Some of them were blinded, he was so like the sun. There you have some gloves to be going on with.

Very briefly before we close. You'd be surprised how much fun you could have and how much money you could make by dribbling. Like most of us, you were probably encouraged not to dribble when you were a youngster, your mom or par probably said to you something along the lines of God in heaven child, you won't get very far in life if all you do is stand around dribbling all day. The thing is, they were right, which is why you would be astonished if you had fun or made a profit simply by dribbling. However, should you wish to pursue this activity as a career option. Here are some tips. Were a cabin bells and caper about a bit while you're dribbling. Place an empty shoe box or similar container at your feet for the collection of coinage tossed by passers by. Do your dribbling in an area of wealthy generous and simple minded people and ensure your dribbling is copious so you do not disappoint. Of course, an element of luck is essential in all such career trajectories. But sooner or later, one of your passers by may well be a top flight television executive from either the BBC or one of the independent networks and they will surely sign you up for your very own primetime show where you will be able to dispense with the cap and the bells and the capering and the toolbox and just face the camera and dribble, dribble, dribble. And I'm going to go off dribbling. Now, that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. And technical note, you can switch off and unplug baguette now. Bye bye back next week.
