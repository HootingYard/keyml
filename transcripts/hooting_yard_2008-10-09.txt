Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. It's been a calamitous two weeks for hooting out, frankly, two weeks ago. For almost the first time in this shows four and a half year history. I completely missed time things and was in the middle of reading something when I had to come to an end, seven o'clock. And then things went from bad to worse. Last week, when I was meant to be sitting here reading sensible pros to a grateful nation. I was stuck on a bus and never even made it to the studio at all. Weirdly, however, the earth continued to spin and now I'm back, and I think I better begin by reading the complete version of the thing that was interrupted two weeks ago. How to defang your venomous serpent. Sooner or later, most owners of venomous serpents will wish to defang their cold blooded pet, neighborhood watch galletas and local busybodies often make life difficult for the venomous serpent owner, particularly when the paths and lanes in the vicinity are littered with the bodies of poisoned innocence with telltale puncture marks and faces frozen in a Rictus of twisted horror. You have to weigh up the pleasure of having a happy serpent, giving full vent to its instinctual drive to sink its fangs into the flesh of a passing greengrocer, and the opprobrium which is an almost inevitable result, social death and a want of invitations to elegant drawing room soirees are regrettably the loss of the venomous serpent owner, as if somehow it's the keeper rather than the pet who has been slithering about dropping unexpectedly from the branches of trees and injecting lethal toxins into everybody from the post mistress to the community hub outreach worker. It should be noted that I'm referring to singularly aggressive venomous serpents, those which attack without provocation, due to there being agents of Beelzebub comes the time eventually, when one tires of black looks for one's fellows in the bus queue and of always being served lost in the butcher shop. It's at this point that the venomous serpent donor concedes that the only solution is to defang their pet. Doing so is not without its risks, especially if the venomous serpent gets an inkling of what is afoot and decides to strike first, the obituary columns of the village newspaper, a trucker with the names of rash wanna be de fangers, whose venomous serpents turned on them, particularly quick thinking venomous serpent have been known to plunge their fangs into the neck of their owner as a pre emptive measure before the owner has even resolved to go down the D Fang route. The only guaranteed method of defending your singularly aggressive agent of Beelzebub is to mesmerize it. Once it's been placed in a trance, it's a simple matter to extract its fangs with a pair of pliers, and then to dab onto its gums, some sort of jewel action, antiseptic anesthetic jelly. There are plenty of proprietary brands to choose from at your local chemist. If Of course you've not been barred from their following the agonizing death of the pharmacist struck down by your venomous serpent on an otherwise unremarkable village afternoon. If that is the case, which it probably is, you will have to go further afield to a different village and in such circumstances, it's best to place your venomous serpent in a creche facility while you're away. Taking the venomous serpent along for the ride has its pitfalls, such as the novelty of a fresh set of victims unlikely to be on their guard against it sudden lethal attacks. You will not want to be blackballed in two separate villages, as this will only compound your problems.

Frank Key  04:33
When you snap your defang venomous serpent out of its trance, it will become fractious. Deprived of the ability to cause almost instant death by biting. It will seek new ways to express its inherent malevolence. And remember that Beelzebub will be taking an interest in its welfare. And just as it may be, you will quite possibly find yourself held responsible for a plague of strangling and crushing in the village. Depending upon the size of your ex venomous serpent, just as you were looking forward to a mantelpiece crammed with invitations to sophisticated dinner parties and potato show prize givings, your hopes may be dashed. And you may have to mesmerize your serpent again. It is never easy the second time

everyone has their favorite type of duck. And for prudence foxglove it was the bufflehead in the summer of 1894, the unsung Victorian genius took a break from writing her daringly modernist plays and compiled a fat volume entitled a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and song. It was illustrated with her own cack handed pencil drawings, which has to be said, look much more like teal or mergansers than buffleheads. The dramatist had thousands of copies of the book printed at her own expense, a cost she could easily afford, after the astonishing success of her plays, such as see how the intoxicated Brut walls wallows in a swamp of moral turpitude until his ravaged soul is uplifted by muscular Christianity in the percentage of a pugilist Vicar 1894 the closing scene in that fine play, in which the Reverend Nabil Attenborough rains, his big boxing gloves fist down upon the head of the intoxicated brute, is unforgettable. prudence foxglove had been collecting snippets about buffleheads from books, periodicals and food packaging since childhood. Most girls of that era would have pasted their cuttings into a scrapbook, but prudence disliked both paste and scrapbooks. And instead she stuffed her snipping into an ever burgeoning accumulation of burlap Gunny sacks. When a sack was plump and full, she stitched it up using exemplary needlework skills, and entrusted it to the keeping of one of her many gardeners for use as a pillow. The foxglove family estate have extensive ground grown wild over generations of neglect, and it was prudence his mother hepzibah. improbably green fingered, who determined to tame them, employing hundreds of snack to peasants from the surrounding hovels, to dig and prune and hoe and herro. under the spell of the social reformer, Rufus crank hepzibah foxglove built a model village for her gardeners to live in. each had their own heart with guttering and drainage and a spigot and a sink and a pilot with a mattress and a shelf of improving cracked and prayer books and a picture nailed to the wall of Christ commanding the woman to throw the sack full of beetles and locusts and flies and snakes and Hornets and wasps into the sea. It was unusual in those days for gardeners and other servants to have pillows. So prudence is Gunny sacks were particularly welcome. Her mother's insistence she had taken the precaution of seeking approval from Rufus crank himself. But then over 90, the reformer wrote back to her in the famous pillows for gardeners letter, in which he laid out a set of principles we would do well to abide by today. If that is we still had gardeners in hearts in the grounds of our estates. Be warned, he wrote, The gardener plucked from his hovel and given a heart with modern appurtenances, such as a sink and a spigot may get hoity toity, if allowed to rest is oddly shaped head on a pillow. Yet krisztian compassion tells us he must be given the chance so to do the risk of hoity toity illness can be tempered, if not wholly eradicated by observing some general principles, rent the pillow to your gardener, rather than giving it to him outright. stuff it's not with Kpop nor duck feathers nor soft downy impoundment, but with gravel or pebbles or sand, paper and cardboard cuttings on the subject of buffleheads and other ducks are an acceptable stuffing in extremists. Use burlap Gunny sacks or other rough fabric forbid pillowcases. Young prudence got herself into a tizzy when trying to decide how to charge the gardener's for pillow rental for they were unfamiliar with With coinage, being peasants. Then at one of her mother's regular soirees, she met the so called potato economist Hicks, an extraordinary man whose theories ought to have resounded down the ages, but did not possibly because he expanded them in prose so dense and clotted and awash with spelling errors that it was and still is mistaken for gibberish.

Frank Key  10:26
When he spoke however, Hicks was a model of clarity, and as he stood next to a blazing heart at the soiree, his massive Victorian beard at risk of catching fire, he told prudence to accept payment of pillow renting potatoes. It was advice she took to heart so much so that As the years passed, and she grew to adulthood, and found worldly success as a playwright, still, she found time each week to Potter from heart to heart, in the grounds of the state of which you is now the mistress, demanding and receiving a potato from each of the increasingly creaky gardeners who at night rested their heads on pillows stuffed with her collection of bufflehead clippings. Many of these potatoes were destined for the grubby lodgings, where Hicks lived in penury, every Thursday morning, prudence foxglove impossible the potato and took horse and cart down to the village post office, where a new fangled pneumatic funnel systems and packages whizzing across the land. What Hicks did with all these potatoes is an enduring mystery, for his diary is, if anything even less comprehensible than his published writings. At one point, it was sort of small clue was to be found in the sparklingly fact book Table Talk of bearded Victorian intellectuals wearing Nestle's a report of a figure sought to be hit standing next to a blazing hearth, making canny observations upon the dietary habits of impecunious bearded Victorian intellectuals in which the potato features prominently. But Hicks famously viewed the potato as a currency, and he's unlikely ever had he ever to have eaten one. He was in any case, an unrepentant carnivore, having trained his stomach to digest liver and gravy in huge quantities, as recommended by the nutritionist Bristow another bearded Victorian intellectual, but one who had never so far as we know, been invited to one of hepes above foxgloves soirees

Frank Key  12:40
after her mother, sorry, after her mother was killed as a result of a cartographic mishap, prudence that first continued with the soirees Hicks, Jetsam Baxter cough drop fig and fig be what all regular visitors trudging across the filthy fields to the estate in all weathers came to propound, their various nostrums and being plied with hibiscus syrup and water biscuits, while prudence is sister Drusilla tinkled sentimental songs at the piano drusillas repertoire was small, but actually compensated for it by devising hectic improvisational passages, so that a mournful dirge such as bring me your winding sheet, or mother of mine, which lasts about two minutes when played straight, could last up to 16 or 17 hours, by which time the assorted bearded Victorian intellectuals are often becomes argumentative. That shouting and fisticuffs were not uncommon. prudency is drudge complained about forever having to mop up bloodstains from the rug adjacent to the blazing hearth, and threaten to seek drudgery elsewhere. petrified of losing so Tyler's are mapa prudence decided to call a halt to the soirees this left Drusilla at a loose end, until she was persuaded to transcribe her piano pieces for a chorus of voices and only afternoons off. She trained and rehearse the gardener's leaving them on loud and lusty sing songs roaming across the fields and hills and alarming cows and pigs and ponies. Without a drawing room full of pontificating, bearded Victorian intellectuals, prudence foxglove to may have found ourself in won't have anything to occupy her, but instead, she relished the solitude and took her first faltering steps towards writing the plays which would make her rich and famous lay in the future. And her early efforts were in verse and prose. She tried her hand detective stories, ballads, non fiction, a history of eggs, an epistolary novel and automatic writing dictated from the spirit world. For the latter, she had her arm hoist in a canvas slim Her hand grasping a steel pen and stunned herself with laudanum. Publishers rejected everything she sent to them. With the single exception of the magazine mawkish chaff, which accepted her poem, the hopeless hollyhocks. Her excitement was somewhat dimmed when it turned out that the editor was a hicksite and paid for her poem and potatoes. Nevertheless, inspired by her appearance in the public print, or be it in a magazine with a tiny circulation, prudence fired off a series of similar pieces, including the lagu breus lupins. The dismal daily is and a spinny choked with marshland weeds, and the press the editor with her industry. He invited her to visit his office in grim northern Milltown. And so it was that prudence found herself taking her first ever railway journey. The trip itself was uneventful, but not so her arrival at the grim northern Milltown railway station, the editor of mawkish chat came to meet her in person. It was a dashing CAD with exquisite manners and the morals of the sewer, and actually disembarked from her train, he swept her into his arms, protested his undying passion for her cross the platform to bundle her onto a small branch line train and carried her away with him to a boarding house in a shabby seaside resort for a week of sinful debauch. Initially smitten prudence soon came to her senses, on the pretext of popping out of the boarding house to buy a couple of truck ices from a sea front kiosk. She went straight to the police station and shopped us a juicer. As the cab was carted off to clink by a team of robbers. She took the train back to the grim northern Milltown let herself into the offices of mawkish chaff with a key she had secretly had cut, and said about running the magazine herself.

Frank Key  17:03
prudence foxglove proved to be an edit tricks of genius. Pages once filled with sentimental pap now played host to extraordinary talent actually called on all those bearded Victorian intellectuals who attended the soirees to pen essays and manifestos and epic poems and novellas and visionary burbling and occasionally automatic writing dictated from the spirit world while their arms were hoisting Canvas slings. Hicks himself was given three entire issues to expand his theories of potato economics, and then a further three when he decided not quite finished, followed by a couple of supplementary issues to tie up a few loose ends, and a Christmas special to repeat the more pertinent points. prudence was the first to publish both figs, hallucinate re ravings, and fig bees tweet nature notes. It was in mawkish chaff that cough drop predicted in the coming century, the appearance upon the world stage of a pamphleteer he mistakenly identified as bahnsen. Throughout this blizzard of editorial activity, prudence continued to cut out clippings about buffleheads and to send them to drew Sylar, who had been charged with stuffing them into burlap, Gunny sacks and collecting the pillow rent from the gardener's It's curious that not a single cutting was ever taken from prudence his own magazine, one can search through the bound volumes, and never once find the word bufflehead. Whereas the names of other types of ducks turn up frequently, particularly Sheldrake, which were an obsession in obsessional interest of Baxters no matter what he was meant to be writing about. Although she did not wholly neglect her own work during these years, penning a so called pneumatic romance and a study of the beards of Victorian intellectuals, prudence had yet to hit upon the formula she would make her own. The germ of that first groundbreaking play was a walk she took through a patch of broken ground in the shadow of a grim mill one Sunday, she chanced upon a derelict, sloshing a bottle of terps and babbling to himself and approached him with a charitable tuppence in an outstretched hand. The human wreckage grabbed at her wrist and would not let go, and prudence realized with an awful Pang that it was her boarding house CAD, his manners were no longer exquisite, and his morals were no longer even have the sewer for they had been utterly blasted away through strong drink and turpentine. She had him carted off to asylum in the hope that he would one day recover and visited him there on subsequent Sundays, listening to his incoherent jabbering as he told her his story, from the despair of prison to the greater despair of the broken ground in the shadow of The Grim mill, she felt impelled to share this terrible tale with the world, and it became the basis of her play. The dashing but debauch CAD and his descent into a Netherworld of turpentine fueled depravity. 1894. writing it she realized her inborn talent for dramatic dialogue stage directions interludes of knockabout comedy, emotionally wrenching climaxes and daring modernist interventions, the latter owing something perhaps to drusillas piano and choral techniques. From the very first performance, in which the legendary actor manager sector bombast played to the dashing but debauch CAD, the player left its audience stand. prudence foxglove had found her Muse and her future was assured. She returned the range of the magazine to then the now partially recovered CAD and heavy back to her a state, where her many decrepit gardeners and her drudge welcomed her as a heroine. Drusilla too was overjoyed to have her sister back for she had grown lame and the weekly traipsing from hot to hot to collect the pillow rent a become a sore trial to her. There was a folly next to our haha in the grounds of the estate, and prudence took it as her writing room. The plays pulled out of her on an almost daily basis. And soon enough, her dramas were being put on in every theater in the land.

Frank Key  21:32
That's it was that come the summer, she decided to take a break. One fine Friday afternoon, she took delivery of a set of sandbags and wheeled them in a Barrow around the gardener's hut, retrieving each of her burlap Gunny sacks and leaving a sandbag in its place. Then holed up in her folly by the HA HA she emptied out the sacks and laboriously copied out each and every bufflehead related clipping into a series of exercise books. When she was done, she took the horse and cart to the village post office and sent the in bundled books to a printer. A month later, she received via the pneumatic funnel system, thousands of copies of a celebration of the bufflehead in prose and song. Unlike her plays, it was not a success. The public had come to expect from her Stern, moral invective, drunken brutes, comedic Japes crippled orphans, vapid driveling, pugilistic Vickers and daring modernism. None of these was to be found in what was, after all, just a forbidding Lee fat anthology of miscellania about ducks were improvements foxglove died in 1922. All but one of the copies was found rotting in packing cases in the cellar of her estate, and that single presumably sold copy. The story is told that its owner, a grandnephew of Hicks had it in his luggage when he stepped aboard the airship Hindenburg in Frankfurt, on the Third of May 1937.

Frank Key  23:35
Time now for a quick television advert.

Unknown Speaker  23:39
The bleak is the link thrilling TV news. A fantastic new show called The bleakest link begins tomorrow. Each week the ghoulish rates of long dead polar explorers, cake tonight's compete with each other to answer really hard questions. The winner is the icicle dripping Phantom whose intones his answers in the bleakest, most ghastly tones filmed at an abandoned abandoned Antarctic weather station. The quiz features a tethered goat. A brain scanner attached to the goat measures the extent if it's dead or dead for or too as each answer is boomed at it through a funnel, while a goat physiology monitoring mechanism registers is fearful trembling. The quizmaster is Dale Winton in a reindeer hide anorak.

Frank Key  25:00
So don't miss that. I'm not sure what day it's on but the bleakest link a quiz show to really be enthusiastic about, I've been wondering if it's time for hooting yard to obtain a kite mark.

Frank Key  25:13
Overseas listeners will wonder what on earth I'm babbling on about. So let me explain. Every single person in this country, man, woman and child, upon seeing a little picture of a kite knows viscerally that whatever it is that picture of a kite is attached to is an absolutely fantastic thing. And I can confidently begin begin to draw with glee. Why this should be so is not quite clear, but it's probably bound up with age old traditions of bureaucratic toggle.

Frank Key  25:45
It has its critics, of course, those in the reality based community who suggest there's something in name in the equation picture of a kite equals gleeful drooling, but we can only go on the evidence before us. I've tested the Pavlovian responses of passers by in a bustling Hamlet yesterday. First I offered people a string bag packed with oozing squelchy muck. There were no takers, and indeed, on more than one occasion, I was clouded around the head or threatened by the attentions of community hub vigilance offices, but then I made the same offer having stuck a picture of a kite to the bag with blue tack. The transformation was astonishing. People began to openly drool in the streets. They ugly uncontained, and several grabbed the bag full of muck until I had inadvertently created a melee. In the end I had to hide behind a piece of civic statuary, but my point was proved

Frank Key  26:57
I'm gonna try a slight experiment. Now I'm going to no i'm not i'm not going to try and sing. This is a folk song, but I'll come

Unknown Speaker  27:05
Well, you know,

Frank Key  27:06
I'll say how it goes. It's a very old folk song actually. Oh, the farmers dancing around the pit is trapped BLT bobbing it upon a bronco. warbling tit sings we have chained the devil. Oh. The farmer trembles in the muck his bellies full of boiled duck. A chicken makes a warning. cluck says the devils loose his chains. Oh. The sky above is a southern black. The devil leaps up on the farmer's back. He puts the farmer in a sack and he jumps back into the pit.

Unknown Speaker  27:41
Oh

Frank Key  27:43
the chicken clucks and the tip still sings it beats it frozen little wings. I rustics you must learn these things. Don't try to train the devil. Oh. Tell your fields and hold your ground how the earth and don't look round. When you hear that awful sound. The devil boiling the farmer Oh.

Unknown Speaker  28:06
That duck he

Frank Key  28:07
ate avenged its fate. It took bowels shape and had bowels hate. The farmer learned that much too late. And he'll dance no more around the pit. Oh.

Frank Key  28:37
That's That's all from hooting out for this week. I'm glad we're back after two weeks of well one week of horrors. I'd like to thank my son Ed for doing the television advert sitting beside me here. And yes, I'll probably won't do any more folk songs.

Unknown Speaker  28:56
Bye bye.
