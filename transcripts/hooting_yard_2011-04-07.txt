Hello, resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air and got a lot to get through this week. So, let's crack on. How can I allay my fear of death? asked a Latter Day Edgar Allan Poe, in notes and queries in yesterday's guardian. A decidedly factual answer was given by one Fred hackle of London SW one. And if Fred is listening, I'm sorry if I've called you fatuous, but your answer was Fred hackl suggested develop a belief in some form of reincarnation. Now the words become your brain with poppycock. One may as well advise someone to develop a belief in a flat earth or fairies, or the legendary third Miliband. That at least was my initial reaction. I turned elsewhere in the paper and chortle that Boris Johnson division of next year's Diamond Jubilee with a quote, Royal Queen Chorim. Quote, sailing the Thames from Putney to Tower Bridge, quote, probably rode by oiled and manacled MPs, unquote. But as is the way with these things, I've remained preoccupied by Mr. hucles twaddle and eventually truck the guardian to one side and started rummaging among the bookshelves to do a spot of research. Some hours later, I found what I was looking for, far from dispensing foolish advice. Mr. Huckle was clearly familiar with the case of Prince Fulgencio, as related in Dobson's pamphlet, the case of Prince Fulgencio out of print, and I quote, Principal Gen CEO was terrified of death. So Titanic was his ego, that though mildly fearful on his own account, he agonized over the great peril a world would face in the event of his dissolution. How in heaven He wondered, would the mass of humanity cope without principle Geneseo there as guide and Savior and model and Paragon. He did not know that the scrofulous peasants huddled in their hovels in the shadow of his palace, pray daily for his death and hatched plots against him. It happens that one day principal Geneseo was riding through the deep dark forest astride his trusty horse, Keith, when he came upon the heart of a wizard, the prince was much troubled that day, as usual, about the prospect of his demise, and he wondered if he might find sucker in the wizards Whoo hoo. dismounting he barged into the heart in his shouty, blustery, violent way, and found the wizard standing in the middle of a pentangle scraped on the floor, waving his arms about in haphazard yet highly significant magical passing movements in toting gibberish and listening to an allen de Botton podcast on his either bottom. Whoa, there wizardy man shouted principal Gen CEO. I am principal Gen CEO and I am terrified of death. What can you do to give me soccer? My name is Huckle croaked the wise old wizard. Removing from his filthy is the headphones together with a couple of crumbs of impacted earwax. If you seek soccer, you must bring me a frog and toad and a goose and a squirrel and twigs of Hazel and larch and Sycamore and a chest of gold principle Geneseo was not a prince to tolerate impertinence from wizards. He Biff takle in the chops with his jewel encrusted princely separator come bludgeon and shouted at him again, this time louder and in a voice more searing and raucous like a crow with an asbo. Said the wizard, steady on Gov. All right, I'll give you sucker. You must develop a belief in some sort of reincarnation to allay your fear of death. The prince was not impressed and did a bit more befitting what sort of wishy washy Guardian reading Paul crooner. He is that he shouted.

Said the wizard again. few more times. Please listen, oh Prince, take this magic glass and as you look into it every morning while doing your princely ablutions, repeat over and over again the words, I am absolutely convinced I shall not die, but will be reborn in a new corporeal frame. You will be surprised how quickly you come to believe it. So I could come back as an even more fantastic version of principle Geneseo shattered principle Geneseo. Well, yes in theory, said the wizard. He thought it best not to mention that the magic mirror might bring the prince back in the form of a worm or a gnat or Wivenhoe bus conductor. I shall give it a try shattered principle Geneseo. But whoa bit I do wizarding man if the magic wrought by your magic glass does not work. And he strode out of the heart and jumped back into the saddle and went a galloping on Keith back to his palace. When principal genteel did die many years later, the peasants chopped his corpse into little bits and buried the bits in quicklime and laid waste to the land around the pit so that nothing grew there for 1000 years. Shortly after his death, legend has it the that hackle the wizard was walking along a path in the deep dark woods from his heart to the newsagents to buy a copy of The Guardian. When he was harried by a tiny flying and he smoked it, it fell to earth, and he crushed it under his wizardy boot. In some versions of the legend, the harrying is done not by a tiny flying ant, but by a huge, ungainly lumbering bus conductor from Wivenhoe. All other details remain the same.

I see civil war in Libya continues to unfold, hooting Yaga listeners will no doubt wish to pontificate about the kerfuffle in pubs and dinner parties without making fools of themselves. To this end, I've compiled a helpful list of Libyan Proverbs, which can be deployed in conversation, rendering your less well informed interlocutors speechless. By choosing the perfect moment to blabber a Libyan proverb, you will be the sinoder of all eyes and may then safely retire from the fray as the company exchange wondering looks and someone gasps Gosh, I bet they listen to hooting yard. We begin with perhaps the most useful of all Libyan proverb all that is round is not a cake. It's so easy, isn't it to assume when you see something round, that it's a cake. If that were truly the case, you'd be in the Lando cakes, which as we know is Scotland. Imagine what a net you would appear if, in the middle of a discussion about the Libyan crisis. You've got that fair desert realm confused with the Bani land of tartan and thistle and argumentative drunks. But by keeping in mind this piece of ancient Libyan wisdom, you can avoid such a terrible gaffe. The flute player dies with his finger shaking. Like all the best Proverbs, Libyan or otherwise, this expresses with brevity and precision an unassailable truth, Who among us can claim to have watched the death of a flautist or not seen that telltale shaking finger? Interestingly, I'm told that Jethro Tull Maestro Ian Anderson has already made provision that when his death rattle is imminent, his hands be fitted with mittens, so none chill sees a shake. He who searches for polls should not sleep. polls are found in oysters. Oysters are found in the sea that logically polls are found in the sea. So that's where you need to go if you're searching for them. Generally speaking, falling asleep when submerge is not recommended. No matter how watertight your skin diving gear. Once again, a little In Proverbs teaches us great wisdom, which we might otherwise overlook. They sell the monkey and laugh at the buyer. I bought a monkey once from a monkey stallers a monkey market, and I wondered why as soon as I handed over the purchase price in cash, the fellow who sold me the monkey began shaking with laughter, slapping his thighs and wheezing and going purple in the face. Now I know. The monkey I bought by the way was called Ian. I taught it to play the flute. The person with no dignity eats his dinner twice. gnomic that's quite an awful Libyan proverbs for the time being

capacious and pulsating it may have been but Dobson's brain contained many, many pockets of ignorance. He was in his mid 50s. For example, when he first came upon the pillow book of say, Shawn gone work of which he had no previous inkling. He did not read it. Merely noting the title on the spine of a copy launched on the bookshelf of his friend are Fang Vanda, who can drop the sino Dutch artist and mountaineer. By back at home later that day, he mentioned it to marigold true. Did you know that an 11th century Japanese bent wrote an entire book about pillows? he asked. Yes, Dobson. Of course, said marigold true. I've borrowed it from the mobile library more than once and read it from cover to cover. Speaking of the mobile library, said Dobson, and he embarked on a long winded and pettifogging digression upon the mobile library, which in that place at that time, took the form of a card pulled by an elegant yet tubercular dry horse, the cart piled high with hardbacks covered in grease proof paper jacket, the dry horse tribute on its way by an equally elegant and equally tubercular librarian Carter, a man of grim countenance and terrible personal habits, who bore distinct resemblance to the act of Carl Johnson noted for his roles as elderly peasant twisted Terrell in larkrise to candleford. And as vidkun Stein and Derek Jarman's vidkun Stein. In fact, it may even have been called Johnson himself. moonlighting as a mobile librarian to supplement his thespian earnings. Dobson posited this possibility, but doubted it was true, as we too must doubt it until all the evidence is in. So implacable was the pamphlet is babbling. That marigold true was unable to get a word in edgewise and was last given no opportunity to point out to Dobson that the pillow book of say Shawna gone, like old pillow books was not actually a book about pillows, but a collection of lists and aphorisms and observations and jottings and poems and opinions and anecdotes. Had he ceased prattling for but a moment, Dobson would have learned this, and not when eventually he exhausted the topic of the mobile library, and the greaseproof paper jackets and the dry halls and the library and Carter and the actor and the fictional peasant and the non fictional philosopher. What do you have gone scurrying off to his escrow tois to sit and scribble the following. I have learned that 1000 years ago, a woman from the land of Yoko Ono wrote an entire book about pillows, such as human progress, that in the intervening millennium, there must be much, much more to be said on the subject. Clearly, I am the pamphleteer to take on this daunting task, I shall set to work on the pillow book of Dobson. As soon as I have taken a nap, and B. The nap will of course be researched for my pillow book, as I shall be resting my head upon a pillow while I nap and present my findings as soon as I wake up. As far as we know, the promised findings were never written down. So refreshed was Dobson by his nap that upon waking, he immediately put on his Iberian duck hunters boots, grabbed an owl punch doc in his fist and set out for a jaunty hike that took him past the electricity pylons and the abandoned swimming pool and the Badger rescue station and the allotments. All the while he hiked, he concentrated his mind on pillows 1000 years of pillows. His brain revealed as he struggled to comprehend the sheer amount of material he would have to marshal in the making of his pillow book.

What advances mankind must have made in the field of pillows since the 11th century, how many heads have rested on how many pillows in that time? How many dreams dreamt during pillow assisted dozers and naps and even comas. pausing for a breather outside the bolted and shattered off license. Dobson suddenly felt intimidated by the scale of the task before him. He watched the skies for swift and sparrows and starlings and other birds beginning with S. He rattled the bolts on the off licence door, he tracked his owl punch dock into a ditch. And then he turned for home, resolve to write, not a pillow book, but a whole series of pillow pamphlets, each to tackle a single manageable subsection of his vast unwieldy subject matter. marigold, he announced bustling through the door. I've had a brainwave with regard to my working methods on the pillow project. I did not know you'd embarked upon a pillow project. Dobson said marigold true. And what have you done with the owl punch, Doc? Oh, I chucked it into a ditch said Dobson. I'll go and recreate it later. But first, I must write out the plan for my pillow pamphlets, updating 1000 years of pillow history since say you Sean Agon, wrote her book about pillows Long, long ago in far Japan. But so exhausted was the pamphleteer by his hiking and his brain activity that before sitting at his s Gregoire, he took another nap. He's asked set a pattern for what was to follow. Every time he determined to set to work on the pillow pamphlets. He convinced himself that further practical pillow research was necessary, and he lay his head upon a pillow and he fell asleep. The project was eventually abandoned when the pamphlet his attention was distracted by cataclysmic world events. And he turned his energies to writing his famous pamphlet on the advisability of taking daytime naps during the unfolding of cataclysmic world events. out of print

newscast in that we diversifier Dennis beer pint has been appointed poet in residence at beppo Lamont, traveling Big Top circus Chief among his duties. Sorry, Chief among his duties is to write a life inverse of the circus strongman last tax. Also known as the mighty Lars so strong is Mr. tax that he has been known to hoist over his head, a container lorry crammed packed with Smithies and bills while pulling a concert hall across a field with his teeth. for the duration of his residency, our famous poet has been billeted in last taxes caravan, a flimsy construction of balsa wood and straw regularly subject to ruinous damage when the strong man engages in such mundane activities as yawning or combing his hair by more or less imprisoning him with his subject. It is hoped that beer pint will dash off a vivid life fairly quickly. To which we can concentrate on other big top topics, including clowns and bears and trapeze artists and lions. Three weeks in bear pint has completed just a single caplet last tax was born 60 years ago, but where abouts I do not know. The problem apparently is that the circus strong man is a deaf mute and fails to respond to any of the biographical questions fired at him by the spindly neurasthenic poet. Tell me when you first realized you were gifted with superhuman strength, beer pint will say, and last tax will appear at him through his curiously milky eyes, and then turn about and start pitching cannonballs for time beyond the visible horizon. Luckily, like many a circus strong man, Mr. tax is a gentle, kindly soul, and has shown no intention of lifting up Dennis beer pint with his little finger and pitching him beyond the horizon. As time passes, however, the poet is growing increasingly fretful about his life inversed and is sorely tempted to make the whole thing up. It wouldn't be the first time beer peintres cobbled together a fictional rhyming biography of a circus strong man. Which of us can forget that majestic sequence, a life of circus strong man grab at Pang in 400 sonnet. Mr. pang of Icarus drum gulls fantastic big top and flea circus, was quite the opposite of a deaf mute, a strong man so garrulous that he hardly ever stopped talking. Pierpont simply followed him around, scribbling into his notepads like a Boswell and then turn the words into verse. We shall watch with interest how this current Big Top residency works out. Rumor has it that last tax has grown fond of his puny caravan mate, and wishes to train him up as an apprentice strong man. To this end, the mighty Lars has been shoveling fistfuls of vitamin pills down the poet's throat and encouraging him to push the caravan waited with several elephants and lions and anvils and cannonballs from village to village as they travel the land till kingdom come.

Speaking of twee verse, I'm going to end this week show with some tweet verse. It's also an advert I regularly advertise the hooting yard website on the show. Don't forget to go to the hooting yard website and do the usual things. Read, look, buy books send money, especially the last but I often fail to mention the dabbler which is a cultural blog for connoisseurs of everything to which I contribute a weekly column on Fridays. And do go to the dabbler. I think the addresses the dabbler sorry, the dabbler.co.uk. Very good at is to lots of things to read. Anyway, this is self explanatory. And it's a 20 verse. Last week at the dabbler I devoted some words to the ever increasing subject of birds. Longtime readers will have read it before. I can always be relied on for avian law. Some say I know not of what I speak which is a monumental bit of cheek whether it's a pratincole a lark or a linate. I know all there is to know about birds in it. For the wings for the wings of a dove or the wings of an that hatch if push comes to shove. when push comes to shove I usually fall over. Unlike the corncrake the rain or the clover. They just fly away on wings of song Think That's correct, but I may be wrong. There's so much to learn about birds of the air more than my pea sized brain can bear. But rather than stumbling through mental fog, I read words of wisdom, the dabbler blog before anyone phones in to complain that the correct pronunciation of clover is plover, I'm well aware of that. But plover doesn't rhyme with over. This is what we know in the trade as poetic license. That's all for me for this week. Bye bye.
