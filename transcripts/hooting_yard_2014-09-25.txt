This is resonance 104 point four FM My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. That last piece of music by Big Boss Man was incredibly groovy. And if this show is as groovy as that, then you will have nothing to complain about. I will do my best to make it as groovy as I possibly can. All man in olm has sent this report from the Festival of arguments to music in all. The annual festival of argumentative music and olm has become a highlight on the calendar for lovers of grumpy German improv jazz. And this year they received a special treat with a performance by grumpy German improv jazz Titan Horst blot with his usual septet, or augmented by glockenspiel steam hammers, Japanese cardboard trombone, and an electronically enhanced janitors mop blot devoted his entire four hour set to a startling reinvention of the old jazz standard chutney on my spat. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the concert. I had a very trying day. In the morning I had an au and the Quinsey and then shortly after lunch, I was stricken by jelly brain and cork in the ears. In addition, I had to deal with a gas leak and a letter demanding the return of an overdue library book. The final straw was the discovery that my press pass had expired, meaning I would have to pay out of my own pocket for a ticket to the festival. Horst blot may well be a grumpy German improv jazz Titan, but I'm not going to open my wallet for him. Instead, I waited until the next day to read the review in god awful racket magazine. What a load of codswallop. It was written by Primrose dent, who opined The music was among other things, searing bippity boppity, tough Curie, Machiavellian plinky, plunky, mordant, splenetic, sunlit, dappled goose, bumpy, tenebrous, and a bit like a truck eyes. In other words, she simply pulled a load of adjectives out of a bag and strung them together. Now I've done exactly the same thing in some of my reports from all in the days when I used to have a valid press pass. I wrote out hundreds of adjectives on hundreds of scraps of paper, stuffed them into a Pepe bag, and then plucked out a few dozen each time I had to write an article on say, the bus stops of all or the gazebos of beekeepers in olm. or indeed, an earlier Horst block concert at the festival of argumentative music in Omaha, where he played a shorter three and a half hour version of track me or my Spats without the glockenspiel, steam hammers, Japanese cardboard trombone, and electronically enhanced janitors mop, but with a steam glockenspiel, a Japanese cardboard mop and a bowl of rice pudding. My articles may have been codswallop too, but they were emotionally wrenching codswallop which elicited great heaving sobs from my readers. I know this because they used to write to me, although I was never able to read their letters smudged as they were with salty tears. When I have recovered my wits I shall write a letter to god awful racket magazine, pointing out that Primrose dent has been deaf as a post since that episode in the wind tunnel at the aerodrome. She also put two adjectives in the wrong sort of bag. Over and out your man in olm

We've had another dispatch from our man in olm. I am stealing all my I might be here for the foreseeable future. In my previous dispatch, I told you that I was stricken after lunch by jelly brain and cork in the ears. My symptoms have abated not one word. I'm not entirely sure what a wit is. Perhaps it's related to a squib, which you might have noticed in your reading over the years, it is invariably described as damp. I have never come across a squib that was moist, or wet, or soaking wet or drenched, let alone one that was dry or bone dry. Not a squib is always damp. Can the same be said for a wit? You might be waiting for me to apologize for digressing, and patient as you must be to hear of the latest doings in all, but apologize, I will not. I have much else to contend with, such as my medical conditions, and that gas leak still not fixed. Added to which there has been a bitten storm over the city. The sky is almost black with buttons, and I have had to light a candle to see by. Then there is the question of whips and squibs. And the revelation that not a single gazebo in all is owned by a beekeeper, at least not legally. There may be squatters off the grid. So I think it's praying that being your man in all means no picnic. I cannot remember when last I went on a picnic. This is made all the more galling when one thinks how easily available sausages so suitable for picnics. Instead, I must eat these sausages indoors or best at a table on a pavement outside a cafe. When it counts as a picnic, I wonder if I spread a blanket on the pavement a few feet away from the table on sprawled there eating my sausages. I think I would be liable to arrest as a pavement nuisance. That's all I have time to babble on about today from all sunlight describe this dispatch as a damp squib. If so, don't blame me. Blame the bitterns whose stormy appearance in the sky over all has blotted out the sun, and made us all a little more prone to gloomy thought. The pig in his sty is a happy fella. Over and out again, your man in all

to press cuttings. Now, the first is explained to the difference between a sport and the game. A sport is something that gentleman can do while smoking. Hence, fishing, shooting and golf are sports. But football and tennis are games. And this is a cutting in the in the complete sense of the word in in that it's a bit out of a Victorian magazine. But the entire context from which it comes has been lost. It's just sort of along the side of a picture brought to me brought to my attention by poppy Nesbitt. And whoever wrote this piece in a Victorian magazine wrote now as I belong to a decade, though not yet phosphorescent family. And that's it. As you may learn later in the show, I used that caffeine as inspiration. But let's get on now with the truncheon brothers. That function brothers Tad and Todd were an acclaimed act from the golden age of variety theater, both dressed as middle ranking police officers. They were bound creatures onto the stage, they were of advancing years. Tad from the right and Todd from the left, or as it might be told from the right and tab from the left, and proceed to bludgeon each other about the head with their truncheons. These were lead weighted heavy rubber truncheons as deployed by real couples. One or other of them, Tad or Todd would collapse unconscious to the floor first, at which point they still conscious, but decidedly wudi woozy one, Todd or Tad, would break into song, usually slurring the words due to the disorientation occasioned by the several blows to the head received. The song itself never varied. A third non performing brother Gilly Blatt wrote both the words and the music. The lyrics were as follows. I bashed my brother on the head, but don't you worry, he's not dead. We will be back tomorrow night for another truncheon fight with a truncheon brothers, Tad and Todd, and we bathe in the blood of the Lamb of gold. We take our balls off stage, of course. Now please cheer us until you our horse will pass a cap round for your cash. Then I'll give told or it might be Tad a final back. The cap passed around the audience by Gil Blatt rarely had any cash in it. By the time it came back to him, though the truncheon brothers never wanted for buttons and corks and scrunched up bits of paper. And the source of that piece was some truly awful act to repair that budget spinny variety theater 1880 to 1910 by Dobson out of print.

Just a reminder that everything I read on this show can be read to your heart's content on the hooting odd website at hooting yard.org. And while you're there, you I always implore visitors to send me some money because that helps. You can also send resonance some money if you go to the resonance website resonance fm.com. So why don't you do that when he went to your pockets, go to resonance and send resonance and money and then got a hooting yard and send me some money or vice versa. And the willow warbler is a type of bird which warbles in willows. I'm not a bird, obviously. But I too have warbled in willows. It's a simple enough matter. What you do is locate a clump of willows then wander into the midst of them and start warbling. You can then describe yourself as a willow warbler, perhaps when at a sophisticated cocktail party leaning in susumi, against the mantle piece, you were approached by a fellow guest who asks you what you do. I am a willow warbler, you can say truthfully. among the various definitions given for warble in the Oxford English Dictionary, the one I find particularly helpful is to Twitter as a young bird to make uncertain attempt singing. This is my kind of warbling, because frankly, I cannot sing for toffee, but there's nothing to stop me making uncertain attempts singing in the midst of a clump of willows. Whenever the mood takes me and take me it often does to the point of mania. I have a varied repertoire of songs which I warble or sing uncertainly on my willowy, jaunt land of ladies by the brothers Johnson, Vienna by Ultravox boom BANG BANG by Lulu and nunc Dimittis serve them to them by the two fools are among my favorites. I struggle with the words and tunes of all of them. But that's par for the course with warbling. Occasionally, I'm shot at by farmers

I told you you might hear more about the phosphorescent family and you're about to now. The phosphorescent family had a pet pig. Its name was Baptist, and it lived in a sty in the family compound. This compound was similar to the Kennedy compound at Hyannis port, home of the Irish American political dynasty. But in the case of the phosphorescent compound, it should be noted that the tall wire fence surrounding the property was like the family phosphorescent. The pig, by the way, was not leafing through some old back numbers of the hammer of Christ. The other day, I came upon an article recounting the tale of how the phosphorescent family obtained their pig. It was not a very interesting story, and I suspect it found its way into the magazine because the author was in possession of potentially explosive information about the editor. Never underestimate the amount of squalor unseemliness blackmail and extortion in which even the most well regarded periodical wallow. Anyway, the article has it that one day the patriarch of the phosphorescent family, old Pappy FOSS was leaning on a clump of gak in the compound, staring at the sky lost in wonder. When he heard distant grunting. He rushed indoors to factories reel to reel tape recorder. For like everyone else in the family, he was a keen tape recorders to distant sounds, whether they want grunts or howls or gunfire, or squelching. The phosphorescent family like nothing better have an evening than to sit around splicing together tape loops of various distant sounds, and then playing them in unison. Over the years, representatives from record companies and avant garde music festivals in olm, had come bashing the gates of the compound offering huge sums of money for these recordings. But they were always sent away empty handed and with phosphorus burns in the very center of their foreheads. The family had no interest in the stardom but we're now inevitably have swept them up had their tape loops gone to the top of the hit parade. On the evening that they listened to old Pappy fosse recording of distant pig grunting. It so happened that one of the tinier members of the family piped up with a query about the source of the sound. told it was a pig she begged for a pig of her own. It was gently explained to her that a pig needs a sty to live in, and there was no such sty in the compound. Then I fell build one myself and split it with phosphorescent muck she caned before bursting into tears. The very next day she did and so impressed with the family by her initiative and energy, that old Pappy fosse strode out across the fields and adapt and abducted the very same pig, who's grunting now played on a continuous loop on the tape recorder next to the tiny girl bed. It was her cousin Armaan fosse, a Franco file who named the pig Baptist. As I said, it's not a particularly interesting tale, but I thought it worth sharing with you, if only because it gives us a first dim insight into the lives of the phosphorescent family. From a selfish point of view, it allowed me to make use tangentially but to my satisfaction of the word. Readings have been taken from the soil. The pig has been chosen, which came to me in my dreams. Just before waking on the morning I wrote that we have phosphorus and Mark rather than soil The peg was adopted rather than chosen. But I've kept faith with my not yet quite awake brain, and that's good enough for me. somebody ought to be good enough for you.

I was time I decided for a brisk splash, so I went to find a puddle. The deeper the puddle the splash here the splash, as kerbing ham reminds us. What you do not want to do, however, is to mistake for a deep puddle and unusually small yet unexpectedly deep pond or mere or come or great heavens to Betsy a waterlogged, bottomless and Viper pit. For that reason, it's wise to arm yourself before setting out or somewhere along the way with a stick. The stick ought to be stout and have a certain length such that when one end of the stick is placed on the ground, and the stick held vertically, the other end is no higher than the top of your head. Then, when you probe the puddle with the stick, you will be able to judge its depth in relation to your own height. The basic idea is that you do not find yourself making a brisk splash in a body of water so deep that the top of your head will vanish below the surface till human voices wake you and you drown. That's not a splash. It's tomfoolery, and perilously so on the day I'm telling you about I neglected to heed my own advice and I did not have a stick about my person when I arrived at what I took to be an apt puddle. It was in the middle of a bosky Lane stretching from loopy cops to the godforsaken piggery at mustard parva. I judged it to be a recent puzzle, taking into account the meteorological conditions and the time of day, which looking at my wristwatch I had at 7:45am this was erroneous. unbeknown to me, my watch was running fast, and the true time was more likely somewhere between 20 to 30 minutes earlier. Taken All in all, my having the wrong time was of no relevance visa v the depth of the puddle. But it was I think symptomatic of my jumble headedness that morning. There was also my failure to obtain a stick, as noted, and the fact that I had had only one sausage, rather than the usual two for my breakfast, which played havoc with my innards, including the brain. I'm a creature of habit. This is not the place to indulge in a rant about the cafe which had so mismanaged its affairs that it was exhausted of sausages at 7am by my watch, or roughly 6:35am in brute reality, or contrarily. Perhaps this is the very place to cast anathemas upon Mr. Boggess, and he's helped me to the cafe. Where else am I to give vent to my exasperation. When I was told there was only a single sausage left on the premises. So early in the day, I suggested to Mr. Boggess that he might send one of the help meats to replenish the supplies. Where he asked me Did I think it possible to get hold of dozens of sausages at such an early hour? This had me stumped for I know nothing of the wholesale sausage business as Why should I unable to frame a coherent response, I babbled invective until my paper napkin to shreds. Mr. Boggess disappeared into the kitchen. When shortly afterwards they returned with the last sausage on a plate. I announced that going forward, as is the phrase nowadays I would be taking my Breakfast elsewhere. He reminded me that talking with Mr. Boggess was the only cafe for miles upon miles in any direction, and certainly the only one within walking distance of my hovel. I think he said provocatively, you will find a rather gruesome cafeteria sawdust bridge station, far, far away. At the other end of the branch line, should you wish to make a lengthy and expensive railway journey before breakfast every morning. For the second time, in this many minutes, I was stumped. I decided to eat my sausage in silence. And it was while doing so that it occurred to me the best way to shake off my feelings of distress. dejection, an incandescent rage was to go for a brisk Splosh

which brings us neatly back to the scene on the bosky Lane. There I was sticklers and meant a puddle. I was confident it was a suitable splashing puddle, and not something in which I might drown. burned into my brain is a map of the several bottomless Viper bits dotted hidden and the scissor between loopy cops and the godforsaken piggery at mustard parva. And by getting my bearings from a study of the time, and the sun and the trees, and the compass stored in the heel of my boot, I was able to ascertain that the puddle could not possibly be one of the bottomless Viper pits filled to the brim with rainwater. It was safe to splash. curbing Hamm has given us the most comprehensive list of the benefits of a brisk splotch in a puddle. I long ago committed his list to memory, and I rehearsed it now as a traffic injury or something similar started chirping in a nearby tree. When eventually I was completely in the zone, I leapt into the puddle, but it was not a puddle. I landed on something solid with a clang and sprained my ankle. sprawled in the line weeping with the sudden spasm of pain. I noticed for the first time a small metal plaque embedded in the earth a few inches away. engraved upon it were the words transgressive rustic fixture. Trump lay puddle seven by Cosmo Hoxton, wangka I had been undone by art. What I had thought to be a puddle was in fact a construction of glass and metal and light reflecting booster technology commissioned by the municipality for which they had paid a preposterous amount of money. I learned as much from Mr. Boggess to his cafe I limped back after binding my ankle with a filthy rag I found discarded in a real puzzle. A few yards down the lane. Mr. baguette it turned out was not only the proprietor of a newly sausage lost cafe, but an alderman on the parish Council and an afficionado of transgressive rustic fixture artwork. It was he who had who Hi, he hopped hig hub Whoa, hee hoo, ha. Dammit. This is what art does to me. It sprained my ankle and turns my brain to jelly. What I needed is a brisk splash in a puddle and a second salted.

Frank Key  29:03
Not my darlings is the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I hope before next week's show you have a chance to go and splash in a puddle. And if you do make sure it's not a transgressive rustic fixture artwork. Bye bye.
