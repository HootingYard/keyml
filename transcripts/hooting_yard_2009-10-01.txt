Good evening, you are indeed tuned to resonance 104 point four fn. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I got a letter the other day from Tim thurn. Dear Frank, who wrote, it's long been apparent to me that hooting yard is by far the grooviest radio program on the planet. But how do I actually get down with the groove? Any tips would be most welcome. Tim is not the only person to ask this or a similar question. boffins in a groove lab hi in the Swiss mountains have spent years or is it mere days, trying to isolate the hooting yard groove for the betterment of humanity. While Mrs. gubbins has been indefatigable in her attempts to express the essence of the groove in the form of knitted tea cozies every time every single time she picks up her needles she fails, fails better, but she goes on, she must go on, she can't go on, she goes on. We will soon have to build a new Depo for all those groovy tea cozies unless we can find a charitable foundation prepared to accept them. But are Tim thurn and Mrs. gubbins and those Swiss boffins asking the wrong questions? Is there in fact, a hooting yard groove to be found? For the true horror may be that the grooviness is entirely superficial, and there is nothing behind it. Some would have it that such absence of groove is unthinkable. The boffins, for example, have invested a huge amount of Swiss currency in retorts, and the lambics and Bunsen burners and rubber tubing and Bakelite knickknacks and Coddington lenses, not to speak of elbow grease and sweat and pipe tobacco would be unmoored, cast adrift upon a sea of cognitive anguish. Were they to entertain the idea of there not being a groove? I am less fretful on behalf of Tim and Mrs gubbins for I know that both of them have other resources, the one button fetish, and the other a pre die election for criminal mayhem. If they could, but except they will never get with the putative groove. Tim would be happy as a pig in muck with his buttons, and Mrs. gubbins could round up the old gang and embark upon a series of armed robberies. Conversely, of course, there is a hooting yard groove, a groove so groovy it out grooves every other group ever dreamed up by the grooviest of groovers. Surely I would know about it you ask? Well not necessarily. Take as an example, Dennis bear pond, ever since the incorrigibly tweet diversify, transformed himself into a beatnik. He has been unarguably the grooviest poet who ever lived. I say unarguably, because there's not a soul who doubts this, not even Michael Horvitz and yet, bear pond promises about the streets and coffee bars and milk bars and jazz clubs and happenings of his adopted world blindly unaware of his own era frangible grooviness. It's true that he makes much of his goatee beard, Polo neck sweater and homeruns and that his trousers of choice are of the drainpipe variety. Yet he remains free of affectation, almost childishly innocent and reassuringly inept, but if anybody's down with the groove daddio it's Dennis bear pond. If it's the case that a hooting yard groove truly exists, it's of a different order of grooviness to the beer pint groove. The two do not quite cancel each other out, but they cannot happily coexist in the same gruppo sphere. Mrs gubbins demonstrated this when she tried to knit a jewel group tea cozy, and became so thoroughly entangled in stray schemes of wool, that she had to be carted off to a clinic. And on that cautionary note, I think I will leave it. Tim thurn may remain in the dark about the group he seeks, but that's the way with a groove. Once you stop looking, you might just find it. Or if not, you can go and sprawl in a ditch and stare at the sky. It is immense and blue and spattered with clouds.

It's all very exciting here at resonance HQ because not only were they a weird kind of jangling Bell, beeping sound you may have heard, but all the lights suddenly went out. But I've come back on again Now that may be the lights going out may be the reason that I made a huge error actually in the piece I just read because wherever I said groovy, and it's variation, groovy grooviest, etc, groovy sphere. I actually meant Zippy. There is a material difference between groovy and Zippy and one not to be sniffed at sniffing will not be countenanced. It's simply not a Zippy thing to do. Anyway, onward and upward. So that should have been Zippy instead of groovy, just replay it in your head on the hosting yard website recently, you know where it is www dot hooting yard.org and I don't think you even need the W's anymore. You can just put hooting yd.org and I alluded to three particular blog jetty and inanities. There are of course, many, many more so many there numberland numbers, but it's worth looking in more detail at the three I mentioned, if only to get the measure of the man. I've had a sudden, terrible thought that I may have read this piece last week, but I don't think I did. But if I did it and think of it as a another opportunity to listen to it, but I think it may I think I'm not sure. Maybe this is the first time I've read it anyway. Three, blonde jetty and inanities one, here's Tim shadow. The tale is told that Blodgett awoke one day in a state of terror, whether he had had a night of orphan dreams brought on by a bedtime snack of processed goats cheese triangles and gooseberry paste, or whether he was just in a flap, we do not know. What we do know is that when he flung open his curtains to greet the day, Blodgett found the sky to be hazy and overcast and the sunlight so weak that it cast no shadows in his tumultuous mental state. Blodgett took this as evidence that he was becoming, or indeed had already become, in substantial, sensible person would have tested this misperception by, for example, the Dr. Johnson trick of kicking a stone, but there were no stones on the floor of Blodgett hotel room, not even a pebble. doubtless there are other experiments Blodgett could have tried, such as bashing his body against the walls or plunging off the balcony. But the mania seemed to have had him in its grip. Looking at himself in the mirror was no help. As Blodgett always had a gray and ghostly paler. It was one of his defining features. As a taught he was always cast as a ghastly race in the school play, even when such a character was not actually required. Pairing himself now in the Milky light of his territory and hotel room. Blodgett fancied that he was becoming transparent. hastily dressing in what fashionistas would have derived as tattered mammalian casual, Blodgett crashed out of the hotel into the abnormally bustling streets. Always Tara Lee, and folk going to and fro bent on their mysterious Tyrolean business seemed solid enough. Blodgett, on the other hand, thought himself wafting, as if he were but a whisper that would be blown away by the first gust. The haze was oppressive, however, and there was no hint of wind. Blodgett found a cafeteria attached to a secondhand snowplow dealership, where he took breakfast, as he dunked iced dough fingers into a thin broth. He kept checking to see if his shadow had appeared. But there was no change in the light. It does not seem to have occurred to him that nothing else was casting a shadow in that town. On that morning. He was as usual, a monster of egocentricity.

Frank Key  09:41
The reports tell us that after breakfast, Blodgett visited the town's one and only metallurgical Institute, where he badgered the janitor to let him in. It appears that he then armed himself with some hammers and cutting blades found a supply of 10 hammered a quantity of 10 into a flat sheet. As an outline of his body with the blade, he was seen carrying his 10 effigy through the streets heading towards a terribly and glue and adhesive supplier. The next witness statements indicate that Blodgett had glued the feet of his 10 self to his heels. So that is a stroll through the streets and lanes and expansive boulevards of the town in crag the Tim Blodgett behind him like a shadow. It is said that he was much becalmed and no longer jangling with terror. The Swiss dramaturge Rolf Terje, wrote a squid based on Blodgett and his 10 shadow, in which the lead character goes berserk when the haze disperses and sunlight batters down upon the town, casting shadows so strong VR as black as pitch. In real life, Broderick was oblivious to the sun, and he dragged his tin shadow with him for months and months until the glue dissolved when he stepped into a chemical puddle outside a post office in Pepin stone to his dockside groans. Can one reasonably include Blodgett dockside groans in a list of his inanities? After all, which of us has not grown when trudging around the docks? There is surely something about all that clanking and shouting, the winches and bales, the crates and trains, the chugging and hooting, the stink of oil and fish and brine, the the illicit to grown from the sunniest of dispositions are not just a single groan, but a whole series of them. Why then charge Blodgett with inanity when his dockside groans were of a piece with yours or mine? Do we succumb to inanity too? Well, no, of course we don't. We are level headed sensible persons. And bloodroot of course, was not. He lived in a fool's paradise. So when we consider him plunking himself down on an iron bench at Pepin, stow docks and groaning, we think to ourselves, there is a man flailing helplessly in extremes of inanity. He may no longer have a tin shadow glued to his hails for the glue dissolved just a couple of hours ago in a chemical puddle outside the post office. But he is by no means freed from his embankment. Look, a girl has perched on the bench next to him. Now, so really taking your time judge them both the man and the bird and choose which one you would trust to best perform a simple task such as savagely ripping and rending a sturdy cardboard box to shreds. Your answer will not I think, be the man with the ghostly power, who sits there groaning, groaning at the dark side. Three, his few tile picking at unbuttons. Blodgett devoted much of his time one autumn to a study of the unbuttoned firstly went off on completely the wrong track, a juicing that the unbuttoned was that which is not a button. Blodgett mistakenly concerned himself with that which is where the button is not. In other words, the button hole, the emptiness, the void, the button will one day occupy or perhaps once did occupy before it thread snapped and it fell into a puddle, perhaps even the chemical puddle outside the post office in Pepin stone, where it lay alongside Blodgett unglued tin shadow. But of course, a buttonhole is just a buttonhole, not on unbutton awesome was a month old before Blodgett realized his error. He had been shattered in his tirolean hotel room, picking futilely buttonholed only occasionally stepping out to wolf down breakfast and afternoon tea and dinner at a cafeteria. Then, one morning he had an epiphany. a monologue devised years later by the Swiss dramaturge Rolf, Terje gives us a flavor albeit imagined of the blonde jetty and brainpan pirouettes of that day. Terje writes

Frank Key  14:36
Terje sorry, turgid monologue is in the voice of Blodgett. I was picking futilely as a button when a crow landed on my Tyrolean hotel room window, so I cast aside the buttonhole and looked at the CRO and the CRO looked at me. I thought if I were to make a puppet of the CRO out of black rags and tatters, I would use buttons for his eyes would I not And then I thought, perhaps the crow is thinking of making a puppet Blodgett, out of torn up shrouds and winding sheets, would it to make my eyes out of buttons, or being a crow, primed by the bird God that made it to pick out my eyes would it need for its puppet, not buttons, but unbuttons. That is when I realized that the unbuttoned is something greater stranger, far more uncanny than a mere buttonhole. The crow flew away, bent on Tyrolean worms, no doubt, but I had seen the error of my ways, and I stamped my foot repeatedly upon the buttonhole I had been picking at with such futility, and I crashed out of my hotel room into the street, the abnormally bustling street, and my eyes glowed brightly, realized not shiny buttons on a puppet, and I strode, with my head held proud and high, seeking afresh the true on button I knew now was there somewhere hidden in plain sight.

Frank Key  16:09
By the time autumn turned to winter, Blodgett had found a run button, or at least what he took to be one certainly met the definition of that, which is not a button and Blodgett pounced upon it there in that Tyrolean town, yet having found it, what did he do? It is a measure of the man's inanity that he simply picked at it futilely for days on end, sitting on an iron bench at the dockside groaning shadowless having fled the turmoil for Pepin stone in the autumn of 1963. Just before the Kennedy assassination, and the Beatles first LP.

According to the gather tear of the Bailey wicks of pointy town, big damp castle is, quote, a singularly fine example of an enormous fetid fortification covered in mold. Unquote. As its name would suggest, the castle is both big and damp. It has always been damp, ever since it was built hundreds of years ago, slap bang next to the marshes. The Baron who built it was convinced that were he to be attacked. It was from the marshes that his foe would emerge. He was assured of this by his prognosticating Whoo hoo wizardy man, who had seen the marshy foe in his dreams and in his dark glass, and in his pictogram cards, and in the end trails of his slaughtered poultry. Like most barons in those far off times, the builder of big damn castle had implicit faith in the Whoo hoo spouted by the man in the pointy hat, who was always at his side. fumes and vapors and gases rose from the marshes and seeped into the very fabric of the castle, and it was covered in mold. By the time the Baron held a grand opening party, to which he invited all the local peasantry many of them died of AIDS use and maladies contracted in the foul damp atmosphere of the castle. The barrel and his woohoo wizard man seemed immune and suffered no ill effect, though they spent much of their time creeping around the crenellations on the lookout for the foam, who would emerge from the marshes have different is today the Martians have been drained and the land is now home to the fictional athlete bob bennett tavole Memorial running track and pole vaulting pit and Pavilion. Every weekend. picnickers gather here in the rain, to commune with the ghosts of the fictional athlete and his all too real coach and mentor, old hollub and above their picnics, looming, the filthy mold covered towering walls of big damp castle, big and damp, and singularly fine. The picnic, the picnickers would run, screaming for their lives, if they bet knew that the marshy foe scene by the Whoo hoo wizard man all those centuries ago, was still there, just out of sight, biding its time, awaiting the necessary conjunction of stars and vapors and drizzle to come howling and slashing into the picnic dimension. whoever wrote the gazzard here remains silent on that score. I wonder why.

Dobson went through a strange phase, where he was consumed by a mania to have an article published in the Reader's Digest. This obsession, mercifully temporary, is thought who've been occasioned by water on the brain following an incident when the pamphleteer toppled off sawdust bridge and was submerged in the icy river for over six minutes. toppling may have been drew to the fact that he was at the time breaking in a second hand pair of Tunisian air cadet boots and was unsteady on his feet hoisted by a crane from the madly gushing water some miles downstream. Dobson was taken to a Riverside crane person's hut and plunked in front of a radiator to dry off. There was a shelf stacked with untold copies of the Reader's Digest in the heart, and the pamphleteer browsed through them as he sat engulfed in steam. Later, back at home, Dobson set himself to write a piece typical of the magazine's content. He was in such a flap that he dashed off not one, but four articles, each entitled I am John's head. These are not versions or rewritings of a single essay, but for discrete pieces of prose, and they could not be more different from one another. In one, john is a Jesuit priest, and his head is the size and shape of a potato. He lives in shrubbery ness, and is wrestling with doubts about his face, which make his head throb. In the second piece, the head is no longer attached to the body of john, a different john in this case, but floating free, much like a hot air balloon and subject to the same hazards in impairments as a balloon, except of course, that our head has a much tougher hide. The third piece St. JOHN has a host upon which the head feed is a parasite. by General assent, this is the most unnerving of the four essays, and there have been attempts to suppress it. In number four, john and his head barely writer mentioned, as Dobson seems to get carried away with a prolonged and rancorous piece of invective about the ill fitting tunisienne air cadet boots, which caused his sawdust bridge mishap. Dobson seems to have got something out of his system by writing what scholars now call the four I am John's head essays. He never submitted any of them for publication to the Reader's Digest, shoving them into an old cardboard box and forgetting about them. In an interview late in life, he was asked about the essays and asked also why he had not written one called I Am Jane's head. Unfortunately, the questions were put to the pamphleteer during the notorious pointy town pavilion interview, in which no sensible or even halfway sane replies were given the interview, his legs were broken, the pavilion burned to the ground, and a blindly oblivious Dobson sat there, drooling into a tin cup and babbling on about President Nixon's fondness for mashing potatoes as a relaxation technique. One he was minded to ape we have no evidence that he ever did so. The I Am John's head essays are due to be published for the first time in a single volume with notes and commentary by upstart young dogs and just Ted Kak when he's released from a Swiss prison. And by the way, for any of those any of you wondering, President Richard Nixon did in fact, much enjoy mashing potatoes as a relaxation technique throughout his life. That's absolutely true.

Finally this week, there was an foolish man and an hairy man, and they were in the lab at midnight. They were mucking about with magnets and retorts and galvanometers and Coddington lenses. Neither the foolish man nor the hairy man was authorized to be in the lab. They had broken in using a jemmy. No unauthorized personnel read a sign on the door, they snapped the bolts of the foolish man could not read standard lettering, and the hairy man was a rebellious curmudgeon who spat in the face of the law, even when it was a bylaw. They were in the lab to build a robot. That robot was to be large and pneumatic and lumbering and foolish and hairy. Its brain would be an exact replica of the brain of the foolish man made from Bakelite and rubber, and its hairiness would match that of the hairy man, for he had plucked out half his hairs and used gum to stick them two sheets of corrugated cardboard, which would form the outer shell of the robot. They had already prepared both the brain and the shell and hidden them days ago, in a bag under a sink in the lab. Only a lab janitor could stop them now. But if he came, rattling his keys and flashing his torch into the lab at midnight, the foolish man and the hairy man had a plan. They would help him with caraway seeds, making him drop his keys and his torch, and then they would muffle him with a blanket. The foolish man had brought the blanket and the hairy man had brought a big bag of caraway seeds. The purpose of the robot was manifold. Neither the foolish man nor the hairy man clearly understood what this meant. But they were acting on the orders of the grumpy man in whom they had absolute trust and whom they dust not question ever. They had seen what happened to the pernickety man, he ended up tethered to a post in an abandoned quarry, pecked by scavenger birds. There was a haplessness about there mucking about with the magnets and retorts and galvanometers and Coddington lenses, which led the witch did the foolish man and the hairy man no credit, both of them had butter fingers. at one o'clock in the morning, they were no nearer to completing the robot in it than they had been an hour before. And then one of them either the foolish man or the hairy man discovered that the piping connected to the sink under which they had stowed the bag with the brain and the shell was cracked and leaking. It was a paper bag and it was soaked through and the rubber and Bakelite and corrugated cardboard and hair were all ruined. There was some sort of corrosive chemical compound in the water. It was that kind of lab. so terrified with a foolish man and the hairy man at the prospect of having to confess their ineptitude to the grumpy man that they ran away into the night, leaving the makings of their robot scattered in the lab. When the janitor came along at dawn, rattling his keys, he took one glance and saw what only a janitor with a well trained eye could see. He pushed a knob on his walkie talkie and made his report. There has been an incursion into the lab by one of the grunty man's manifold robots, he said. Fortunately, it appears to have been as unstable as all his other robots and has destroyed itself for mopping up will begin now.

That's the end of this week shooting yard on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed the mysterious bleeping noises if you heard them, and you won't have enjoyed the darkness unless you too were plunged into it. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
