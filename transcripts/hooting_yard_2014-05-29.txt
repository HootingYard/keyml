Good afternoon This is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. And coming to you for the second week live from the Science Museum. Those of you who aren't in London or even listening to the show from far flung corners of the earth, at which point I should say hello to Mr. Webster in New Zealand, who I know is listening. The Science Museum is a large and important building in London. And it's a Museum of Science. It contains many a plethora of evidence of human ingenuity, not least of which is the 27 foot Denman loudspeaker, the largest single horn loudspeaker in the United Kingdom, a reconstruction of the exponential horn, designed in 1929 by RPG, Denman. And it's that, which I'm speaking through, at this very moment. So and will be for the this weekend, the next two weeks. Now, I was going to begin this week by reading a story called Dixon of Dock green. But unfortunately, I seem to have failed to bring it with me. And so I won't be reading that. But what I can tell you is that the story Dixon of green, which I wrote was a garbled version of it was adapted as a long running television series, starring jack Warner. And I have an anecdote about jack Warner which I'd like to read to you now. JACK Horner, English Actor 1895 to 1981. invited to contribute a recipe to a kitchen goes to war, a 1940 government issued celebrity cookbook. The man who likes to play diction of green, excelled himself with cheese and chutney biscuits. It's quite a difficult recipe to put together. It consists of water biscuits, spread with margerine topped with slices of trees. Plus chop me.

So instead of Dixon of green, I'm going to read you a piece called the immersion man. This is actually a very old piece it was written in the previous century, long, long ago. And sometimes when I read it, I get rather overexcited so we'll see what happens. This is the emotion man. The man with the hammers, the man with the flags. He has a second pair of shoes. He bought them in Portugal. He repaired them in Spain. He's head is the same sizes to have anyone else's head, or a few pounds of oranges, plums or other fruit. It will take years. Once he decided to paint a ship with stolen paint, he could not look back. The ship when painted, would be burnt sienna in color stains apart. What a long ship it was and is and will be. Its sailed from shore to shore. He held sway at the helm and on deck is fat plump stones into his flask. Much later, he knew they would be crying liquified in his Blender in his kitchen, in his other heart for what he built at the docks for those mornings when he did not set sail upon his ship to reach some other shore, where he had yet other hearts. But, and here we reached the pace. The point is sacktual contained only the most blackened and charred of wheat husks. In weather so suitable for breakfast on the lawn, eight class owns and a jelly jelly eel, he would randomly auto force them into the ground, so they were perpendicular, not far away from the tallest of the six trees. All fixed in place, he will use up the last of the stolen paint to paint them the oars with his Harriet Brock. Its wouldn't handle has seen better days, particularly the days in Jutland shaving engine, Reykjavik, other landmarks of all near Scandinavia. Those were the days before he was pulled towards the seas. Who pulled him to the seas, who donned his flag. Who made his shoes. Ah, but I cannot say not yet.

The cattle Max was stacked in a rough wooden crate. The crate had been painted butter had been kept in this crate, butter used in the sandwiches he did not have time and all those pole vaulting or archery competitions he didn't entered by struck a medal for him. He was so keen. He had lost the medal. It was made of zinc. It had fallen out of his pocket in February. deep snow lay on the ground. He remembered the day well, because he had to. It was potato day. The village wrestler was sure to have provided an enormous cooking pot full of potatoes steeped in lemon juice, as he always did. No one knew how old he was. Although some claimed to celebrate only his more repellent birthday parties. He was extremely tall, he had to stoop to enter his own house. It was a squalid house, it stank of vinegar. This wrestler was want to sing remarkable songs as he sat on the jetty dangling his feet in the brackish water. One of the songs one of these remarkable songs went Vienna, it means nothing to me. For many years, he attended to his broken nose, applying a new set of bandages every day. They use bright red bandages, having smeared them first with incl ointment. The bottles were identical and kept on the same shelf. The shelf was made of plastic, but it sloped towards the left. Nothing heavier than two small bottles awesome. cokes could be kept on it. He brushed his hair. There like was hidden by trees in Mexico of all places. for 1000 years that light blue. One day when he was famished, he swam there. He wore water wings, rubber ones and yellow. He had to inflate them with his own breath. It took all morning. By noon he was exhausted. stealthily, he crept by torchlight to the moorings. They've been varnished so thoroughly that he slipped and fell. No bones were broken. But the ranch was no longer his home, nor could it ever be so not like not while he was such preposterous trousers. Eating DRAM by the spoonful, he watched the branch giveaway. It fell to the ground. He was wearing tinted sandals, three sizes too small. The stitching was coming loose on both of them. And not before time. The man with the clarinet arrived. He sprang through his feet on legs. They mucked about with each other's pencil sharpeners all day. an ailing vulture circled overhead. It had splendid musculature or thought it did. Blow on the pebbles by dawn skin diving equipment. The pub was shot. The landlord had ruse is underneath his hair. He carried a selection of racket needles, vicuna nets and filigree. These he patted with yearning. His one foot was shot in an enemy's show, a token of combat that had a valgus stench, but squashed answer earwigs on the paving with the best of the, this was called in crop B. It meant nothing, or it meant so much he could not be sure. Long ago he had become entangled in the Gnostics, and now there was no escape. the enormity of it was breathtaking. It had taken centuries to build, but the bath jr warehouse was a recent addition. He spotted it and kept on spitting. It was unable to stop himself shaggers sprouted but did not grow. They were spindly and vicious. He could not bear to speak Hungarian in this day and age, but all of his

boxer shorts were made of fabric printed in Budapest. There is a reason for everything, but not for food. Food must be speared with large tin forks or so he thought he poked the plankton with his fork. The plate had been smashed it laying pieces on the linoleum. He intended to take up athletics by wooden wrapped him in flowers and other greenery and all because he had ruined his crayons at an early age. He was wicked, wicked, and he went on a cruise. The cruise took him north. Then it took him West. He was not sure which coinage to use. He had a selection in his little pocket. Like wait so much. He was forced to trudge in a fit of dementia. He set fire to all the maps. He put the cartons to one side. They would be useful to him at a later date, if at all. But it was time to hold a grudge. He chose a fishmonger and wrapped him on the nose with a fountain pen. Violet ink spurted out onto the fishmongers mouth and chin. He had locked drawer and some pianos. Where did he keep his pianos by sent a detective to find out one day he would brandish despicable objects inside his tent. It was a famous tent, but I should phrase it. It was decorated with a boa constrictor motif lacquered in mode. He came upon it on a mountain ledge. He held it into a sandpit. his skull was perfectly formed and bright blue. There had been much talk of this in thousands of corridors, and on horseback. All the fruit had been chewed to checked his pale dictionary for errors. And the B he found plenty. He pasted them up through Becky's head extricated some tax from the hardboard and forced them into an envelope. This was stylish. They sat by the big clock and his sister arrived. She was an emic, right. She buried three or four plant pelicans and Yak near a factory. Right? This had to be the factory. That must be an ambulance. It's bloopers are off patron un-godly. Bundled inside a blanket. She sported a mask, half of it carved out of mahogany and the rest of something metallic delicate traces a bit by smeared on the gasworks for this was Raymond's village. His Dublin was better than the rest. He had come this far and had no sandwiches left. He was in agony. renting the beekeeping outfit from his parents grass had been no laughing matter. The reek of sandalwood and lavender was in the air. He was penalise wearing an alpha meter instead of a wristwatch to careered along the towpath of the canal. The immersion man was on his way

Here's another piece from the previous century and these pieces have been taken from a paperback book called twitching and shattered, which is now out of print. But apparently you can but occasionally buy copies on eBay which fetch between two and 300 pounds. So look out for that. Switching and shattered by Frank key published by the malice aforethought press. Long long ago in the previous century. This is called another map of Hoon

visited the dying poet punter windigo he peered at me through his oxygen tent. tears ran down his face. I had never met the author of 40 visits to the worm farm before. Yet here he was twitching and shattered. In trusting me with a sheaf of maps. They were bundled together and tied with string. I understood that their significance would become clear when his last will and testament was read. When the guy made a remarkable recovery and spent the next few years attempting to regain possession of his maps, as time passed, he became ever more monetary and violent. One point I requested and got police protection is desperation to retrieve those old scraps of paper, kindled my own interest. And I became obsessed with the yellowing package, sell them letting letting it out of my sight. I waited for puncta windigo to die.

There were 26 maps by had all been hand drawn crudely with a variety of felt tip pens, biros, chalk and charcoal. Strangely, none contained any place names, or other indications of the location depicted. There only common characteristic was that they all showed what appeared to be railway track. They varied in size, the largest unfolding again and again, to cover an art an area of 10 by 16 feet. The detail was incredible. And yet, and yet nothing to indicate where in God's name the maps were meant to represent. One day I read in my newspaper a review of punter windigo the latest book, it was called a map of hoon. The reviewer described it in all the usual terms, pungent lucid, ennobling valiant, I scoffed for I do not give two pins for poetry, but immediately set out to buy a copy. It was unavailable in every bookshop, I know, always on order or not our type of stock. I was ready to throw in the towel, whatever that means. When I saw the book advertised in one of the more inept of the literary journals, I wrote off to the box number given and waited. A week later, my postman was badly maimed by a parcel bomb, which exploded with a tremendous bang, just as he was strolling up my garden path. Forensic scientists were unable to piece together anything of interest out of the fragment. Two months went by, I discovered one of the postman's socks in the branches of my Pevsner tree. The book never arrived. I wrote off again, this time using a pseudonym. I then departed from my annual jaunt to Greenland, having demonstrated to the new postman, how parcels could be delivered through the cat flap in the back door. As I disembarked from the aeroplane to commence my holiday in Greenland, I was felled by four or five arrows. Somewhere in the snowy waist, and Archer, of deadly accuracy had awaited me. I was hit twice in the chest, once in the arm, and at least once in the head, I was immediately put back on the plane and given emergency medical treatment. We flew directly to Iceland, where I was installed in a Keflavik hospital. My recovery was slow. After a month I was transferred to a sanatorium on the banks of some fjord or other. I spent the days learning Icelandic and talking to a fellow patient in broken English, and even more broken German. She'd been a technician at the timber plant, but it suffered a nervous breakdown of epic proportions. At one point, she believed that she was made out of wood pulp. inexplicably, however, she provided me with the key to the riddles strewn maps. For the life of me I cannot remember precisely what it was, she said. She prattled on about moose, elk, and the enormous Blizzard laying waste a huge tract of Northern Finland earlier in the century. And it was a shaft of light were cast Suddenly, a bit thought upon the mysterious maps, revealing all the secrets they had ever held. At least it seemed to make sense at the time, I could hardly wait to get home. punter windigo died shortly afterwards, it's thought from a broken heart. Critics savage his last work, gastro enterprises bill is awarded the Order of Lenin, a sonic sequence felt to be mannered, sterile, and technically, I could only agree when the last will and testament was read. It made no mention of the maps, but by then I knew their significance. Anyway, thank you that is varnas semi garbled and it somehow windy goes death robbed the maps of their interest. I now have more important things to think about. His father and I were planning to start up in the timber business together. Here on the bank of the fjord next to the sanatorium. A few years later,

I took a short trip back to my home country. A dusty parcel containing a copy of a map of Hoon, lay on the kitchen floor next to the cat flap. I made a cursory search for the bundle of maps, but was unable to find them anywhere. Putting duck feet over the furniture. I hurried away. I was eager to get back to our wooden shed is Varna had promised to buy me a brand new song for my birthday.

This is a very brief extract from a memoir called the journals of a vicious pirate. Where he had been awake for 11 nights running cloth had been wound around the jugs and a fresh coat of varnish applied to the trap doors. The hooks were blue, they're blue with the blue of farmyards oil derricks malfeasance, I broke the engineer's dockets snapper. He was furious. his fists met mine. But violence was avoided with a plum. There was something gruesome stuck underneath the lantern. I hold it over the side to the cheers of my crewmates. Then they turned on me one by one blob with his yellow tooth swab with his bottle of vinegar. flub with the rhinoceros mask and vestiges of trouser I fled. Later that night, the Carpathians in my sight, a small shot of bitumen became embedded in the rafters of my cabin. The time had come to throw the ledgers into the sea. With irrational joy. I glanced up at the stacks of sailcloth and my eyes ran with tears. Would I taste potatoes again?

Finally this week, last week I promised you further extract from further science book 20. by Norman Davis published in 2001. It seems appropriate to read about further science in the Science Museum. So, here is Norman Davis on fly psychology. Wow. That when a rapid approaches made towards a settled fly, it will zoom off in ample time on every occasion having a brain geared to the very fastest responses to but if a fly is settled on a dining table, and a blade be held 18 inches above it, it remains settled. Three now if that blade gradually reduces height, it can come to only one inch above the neck of the fly. Without the house fly moving. Fall. Then, a sudden movement of the blade will cut off the head of the fly without it stirring a muscle. I II, a fly has no brain conception of slow motion.
