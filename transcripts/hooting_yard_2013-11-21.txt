Good evening, this is resonance one or 4.4 fm. My name is Frank K. This is hooting out on the air. And this week I'm going to tell you how you can make a lovely scale model of Dealey Plaza, the site in Dallas, Texas of the Kennedy assassination 50 years ago tomorrow on the 22nd of November 1963. First, get some plasticine. Before removing the packaging, wash your hands thoroughly in warm water. If your hands are really grubby, for instance, if you've been doing grubby things, use swore fieger I'm making no moral judgment on your indulgence in grubby practices. Merely noting that warm water by itself will not suffice to cleanse the pollution from your fleshly extremities. As for your immortal soul Fabi for me to pronounce upon the peril in Richard is placed by your unconscionable grumpiness. After all, I'm no saint. That being said, I applaud the kind of Grubbiness to which you may have fallen prey, or be it I do not make it my business to go about declaring my own rectitude, for that would be to boast, and thus itself sinful. Once or twice, maybe I have dipped my toe in the slimy puzzle of moral turpitude. And that was quite enough for me. Now, to the second stage of this exciting project, with your prayer book or catechism resting upon the work surface and easy reach open the packet of plasticine. In tone three Hail Marys, break off some plasticine and begin to move it into the shape of the grassy knoll. It is advisable at this point to go and fetch your rosary beads. Before completing the grassy knoll part of the model, open up that tin of swarf eager and clean your hands again, you can never be too careful when you've made a passable model of the grassy knoll, take some matchsticks and press them into the plasticine to represent the white picket fence. Saya novena. Now grab another trunk of plasticine, and fashion a miniature version of the Texas School Book Depository. Remember to tweak a tiny tubular shape poking out of the sixth floor window to show assassin Lee Harvey Oswald mailorder man manga carcano rifle with which he shot the president. Some people would insert the word allegedly into that sentence, but not me. I've read CASE CLOSED by Gerald Posner, so I know whereof I speak. A pink blob of plasticine will do for Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hat. The underpass on the stemmons freeway is quite tricky to make out of plasticine. So you may wish to use a few bits of cardboard. Your local supermarket probably has empty packaging and boxes piled up somewhere for customers to take away. government gets sufficient boxes to cut enough cardboard for the underpass. And while you're out and about drop into your nearest Catholic Church and make your confession to father o Flaherty. If your priest has a different name, don't worry. If you don't have a priest do worry, for you will burn in hell. However skillfully you managed to complete your plasticine and cardboard and matchstick model of Dealey Plaza. When you return home, your soul now washed clean of all disgusting filth. Put the finishing touches to your muzzle by curving a rectangle of plasticine into the shape of the pergola from where these pruder footage was shot by dressmaker, Abraham Zapruder. If you've exhausted your tin of swore fieger, plant your hands into a basin of piping hot soapy water, while contemplating the martyrdom of your favorite saint. Place your toy Dealey Plaza in a suitable location. For example, on the mantel police mantle piece display cabinet little kitchen table. Next time father, oh flatty drops in for a cup of tea. Ask him to bless your model by sprinkling it with holy water. He will be happy to oblige, I am sure.

Right, we're gonna have a surprise extra bit of JFK stuff later on in the show. But to change the subject briefly, I hold in my hand, as I speak to you a copy of the awareness, which is the Journal of contact UK from summer 1968. And I'd like you, I'd like to read to you why this is a sort of 60 page pamphlet have contact UK, who you used to be able to join. I mean, I don't suppose this that around if they if this was summer 68. But it cost 10 shillings a year. And you got a membership card, cop for copies of awareness, and all other relevant information needed to fully participate in contact. And so I'm going to read to you an article from this issue, which is called inside a spaceship, and this is exclusive to contact.

Frank Key  07:20
This is the story of a 20 year old young man from near Belfast. He is a serious and pleasant person who is known by his parents and friends as a truthful and honest man. He is warm hearted and sympathetic. The young man is healthy, well balanced, possesses a good outlook on life and has for personal reasons, asked us not to reveal his name. And the rest of the piece is actually written or narrated by the by the 20 year old young man. On October the sixth 1967 I was walking home alone from a jazz club in Belfast. The time was 1045. When I reached the outskirts of the city, I became aware of a moving object in the sky, which was at first white and then turned to a dark color. The object as seen from the ground was about nine inches in diameter. It was still quite a distance away. It began to come nearer, and suddenly a yellow beam of light came out to me from the object. The intensity of the light increased. for about five or six minutes it pulsated rhythmically and danced around making me feel dizzy, slightly sick and very sleepy. Then I thought I was going to fall to the ground, but I did not feel the impact. I was blacked out completely. The surrounding countryside was quite isolated. Afterwards I regretted that no one was with me because I wished I could have had a witness. When I woke up I was inside a strange looking room. I was lying on a sort of table made of metal. I felt it. The room was oblong without windows. I noticed a dome shaped ceiling and walls made of shiny polished silvery metal. On the floor I could see a blue light which reflected on the shiny walls. I could hear a faint bleep bleep sound. I tried to lift myself from the table but I could not move. On my wrists were metal bands which were attached by thin tubes and wires to a square metal thing above me. There was also a metal band around my head, which like the wristband was attached to the metal thing at the foot of the table was a kind of long narrow screen suspended from the ceiling. The square metal thing above my head said, and sorry, the square metal thing above my head, and the TV set was somehow connected with wires and tubes. I gazed at the screen which was dark and thought, How the hell will I get out of here? No sooner had these words gone through my mind than the words were repeated on the screen in a whitish light, like sort of movement. Soon the words faded away. I repeated this thought three times, and the same thing happened every time. At first, I was scared because I did not know what was going to happen to me. Also, I could smell a sulfurous odor, which I disliked intensely. I noticed for men and a girl standing around me, they appeared quite friendly, and they all had a bluish glow around them. The tallest man came over to me. He had short black hair, brown eyes, and a normal complexion. Like the others. He was dressed in a dark one piece suit with high collars. He was about six foot tall. The others were about five foot five inches. When he spoke, it was in broken English. And his first words were at last someone you will do. He put his right hand over my wristband and they clipped off. He did the same with my headband. I was free and got up. When I stood by the side of the table, I noticed one of the other men exercise examining my coat, which was made of a plastic material. They must have taken it off before I was placed on the table. Because I was wearing it at the time I became unconscious. The tall man took me by the shoulders. Now I could fully notice the blue glow around him.

Frank Key  12:09
He took me to the girl. She had long blonde hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones, slanted eyes, and very simple it. Her skin was very fair, delicate and freckled. All over. She was dressed in a dark colored one piece suit like the others. And on her feet, unlike the others, she was wearing white boots. She looked at me and said, Come to me. I said, Why? She replied, I want you for an experiment. What kind of experiment I asked. She said, a sexual relationship. I said, I refuse to do this. At that moment, the tall person came up to me and said, If you refuse, we do not want to use force. This was set in a very friendly way. And at the time, I did not know whether it was a threat or not. Later on, I realized that if I had refused, they would not have compelled me because they are against any form of force. It must have been realized that there were too many people standing around. Therefore, the tall man and the girl exchanged glances, whereupon he and the other men withdrew. I was left alone with the girl and an intimate relationship took place. Afterwards, the other men came in and spoke to the girl in a strange language like staccato. Before my relationship with her, I had asked, Where do you come from? She had replied from another galaxy. I said, which one? She said, that does not concern you. I must say that all the people were very kind and friendly. I did not feel as if I had been kidnapped or anything like that. They asked me why do you have wars, I tried to explain that people have differences of opinion, and that one nation will go against the other. If they told me that they had no experience of that, and that long ago, they had overcome wars and overcome fears. I think they are more intelligent. I was taken back to the table, my wrists were fastened. Also the band or strap was again placed around my head. They told me it will not be the last you will see of us. Then yellow lights started to shine on me up and down, up and down until I became sleepy and tired. The next thing I noticed before I passed out was a man working buttons attached to the table. The next thing I remember is that I woke up In a field, one mile from the spot where I had originally blacked out, I was lying in a wide in a side position. I looked around and noticed an oval object near me on three legs resting on the ground. It was quite a size 20 to 50 feet. A bleep bleep sound came from it. The legs went up, and as it took off, it made a whistling sound and disappeared very quickly. I returned home at 2am I was wearing my coat, which I wasn't wearing when last on the table. I felt pains and I also had a pain on the head, which lasted for five days. When she saw me, my mother remarked how whitened shocked I looked, I told her the story, and she believed me because of the state I was in. Whenever there is a UFO around, I can sense them because I get a headache. I am now very anxious to see the girl again and feel I have fallen for her. It is a lovely feeling to know she exists. I can't forget her. From time to time, I can see her face, and I have the funny feeling. She's thinking of me. And I know I will see her again. And my child. She told me that the purpose was to get a new sort of breeding. She said we want the seed of Earth men. And for that purpose, we have experimented all over the world.

Note the smell of sulfur might be repugnant to us, but it is in no way to be associated with anything unpleasant or morbid. In the organic world, we meet with sulfur everywhere. of organic materials rich in sulfur, we can name the essential oils of onion, garlic and mustard sulfurous water is drunk at the spars for health reasons. And sulfur in general is a great blood purifier. Also, the smell of ozone could be confused with a sulfurous sub smell. Few people have really smelled sulfur unless one goes to the sulfur as well as in Iceland or New Zealand. It is a fact that the sort of contact our young man had or for that matter the one Mrs. C experienced will prove very little to the world at large because of the lack of concrete material evidence and witnesses. We have decided to accept these accounts at their face value, leaving them open for the individual listener to compare with similar cases and look forward to receiving any constructive comments.

Frank Key  18:13
They store the narrative of Mrs. See follows rather than proceeds the the story of the young man from Belfast. The title of Mrs. C's narrative is young extraterrestrials want to make contact? I'm a bit confused about contact UK I'm not I'm beginning to wonder is it a UFO journal? Or is it some kind of dating journal for extraterrestrials and humans? I don't know. Anyway, I'm gonna read young extraterrestrials wants to make contact with you next week. What we're now going to have is completely unexpected to me as as to you, but I was handed a CD while I was reading about how telling you how to make your own plasticine model of Dealey Plaza. And it's the great lip key be with his own take, as they say, on the assassination of Kennedy, apparently, but I haven't heard it yet. So it might be anything who knows. Take it away. labkey

So that was left key Bay with a couple of pieces inspired by the assassination of Kennedy, which happened 50 years ago tomorrow. And, of course there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many conspiracy theories. My favorite one that I came across recently was the Kennedy was actually shot by the governor of Texas, john Connelly, who was sitting in the seat in front of him. And someone has gone through these pruder footage and tried to show that with the Connelly sort of turned around and has a gun in his hand and shoots Kennedy doesn't really explain how this could possibly be the case, but anyway, is quite amusing. nearly the end of the show time for a couple of very brief lives. Kaspar Hauser, drove an enigma and feral child born possibly 1812 died 1833 the doctor who cared for Kaspar Hauser, was befuddled by the variety of things that caused him distress. He was unhinged by thunderstorms. The full moon brandy, loud noises quiet noises squeezed cheese, bright daylight beer, cats, spiders, snakes, flowers, grape juice, beards, the color black and comedy. There really isn't time for any more but you know, I'm going to throw in this one. Paul heini English Oh, I was gonna throw that one in. Yeah, Paul heini, English journalist and broadcaster born 1949 heini was once told by an old man of the hills. Sheep have only one ambition in life. And that is to die. Bye bye.
