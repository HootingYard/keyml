Good evening. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. Man is never more spraying than when he is toffee. Or to put it another way, cheek by jowl as it were. There is in man a faculty of readjustment best exercised in plectrum. It was out of some grocer 10 that our forefathers beat their washbasins when Pang born calls, so the trellis trembles, and it was ever fissel. These reflections were occasioned while boiling an egg frying a rasher of bacon and toasting a slice of bread. Aha, you explain he is fixing his breakfast, and you would be right as right as rain. But his rain right? pips a spat on two hissing coals when we consider such questions. The puddle of infirmity is flashed through on scorched clim soul souls. The new Gar is both pink and white. But yes, it was breakfast, the egg and the bacon and the toast. It always would be breakfast in this dispensation. Who was it who wrote that the careworn man dipped his T's in the duck pond, only for his hair to stand on end when struck by lightning. Freedom then we can unhitch from the fork. What glue was and what glues work? That is a birds pinion of a lack. The spark is crunched, the air bought and winters booming, ever splat breakfast digest it how we may it was innocent of the sausage. And I there is a lesson there. One wipe with a rag on a panel. Beat that panel as your forefathers beat their basins out of 10 is it just spraying nuga we covet North coffee former dobb

heard declaimed in my dreams in the moment before waking on a windy winter's morning. It was later as I was scuffing breakfast, eggs, plus a surfeit of lampreys that I realized their significance. I slapped my forehead and went to retrieve from the cupboard under the sink my battered tin crown, the time had come to stake my claim to the Iron Throne, I would reign over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. First of all, of course, I would have to eliminate all the other pretenders to the throne, of whom there were many, many, so many, I had not thought death hadn't done so many. But for all the corpses piled up along the pathway to the throne, there yet remained innumerable claimants who were very much alive, alive and in brutish, good health, and heavily armed and have psychotic temperament. If I was going to take my rightful place sitting on that throne with my bobble and scepter I was going to have my work cut out. What I needed was a troop of minions. The presence of minions lends a kingly heir even to the windiest of throne claimants straight after breakfast. Then I popped to the news agents to pick up the latest issue of the directory or register or whatever it is that invaluable publication which lists in alphabetical order with contact details and a company By skillful line drawings with much cross hatching done in a spidery pen, all minions currently available for hire. Sitting on a municipal park bench buffeted by the wild winds, I leave through the lists and plumped for the minions have the pointy sticks. Alas, on closer inspection, this turned out to be, quote, a knitting group composed of some wild and crazy folks. Unquote. The last thing you want in a minion is wildness or craziness. Rather, what you're looking for is slavish devotion slobbering and a propensity for violence. Being armed with a pointy stick is a definite advantage, which is why I had been initially attracted to the knitting group. In the event, I picked some other minions from the directory and gave them as their first task, the foraging from forest to sticks, and the sharpening of those sticks until they were pointy. I accomplished all this while still sitting on the park bench. The wind, as I said was wild. Wild was the wind, and I heard the sound of mandolins the sound grew louder, and I realized that across the park, on the other side of a swan mad Lake came the approaching forces of a pretender to the Iron Throne. It may have been Stannis Baratheon, or possibly Balan Greyjoy. whichever one it was, his army was strumming frantically at mandolins playing I think, listen, the snow is falling by Yoko Ono, which I recognized as the beside of Happy Christmas war is over, recorded with that beetle she married. Ha. I thought to myself, or rather spoke aloud in a kingly way. Nothing my minions would hang on my every word whether it made any sense or not. Half this puny pretenders army sings of the snow falling when the it may be and wild may be that wind but snowfall there is not not here. As any fool no snow falls far north of here by the wall. Clearly the army is geographically obtuse and disorientated, they will be easy prey, particularly as they are armed only with stringed instruments. And then I issued a command to my minions, ordering them to rush at the pretenders nincompoop army and poke at them with their newly sharpened pointy sticks. Last was the scene set for what history books would call the Battle of ballista lane municipal Park. We routed the enemy and I was one step closer to the Iron Throne. It was time for lunch.

Frank Key  08:15
I headed off to a nearby stable, tore the heart out of our living horse and gobble it down while it was throbbing and hot and bloody. Unfortunately, there were no barbaric Dothraki present to witness this gustatory Feat. We are not all as media savvy as the Khaleesi, who had the cameras present during her own horse heart eating lunch scene. But I was not troubled by her far away in the red waist with her grunting savages and baby dragons. Other claimants to the throne had to be dealt with first, not least Rob's Stark It was at this point I realized the knitting group could be of use to me after all, who would dare to stop me I reasoned if I came bashing upon the city gates of King's Landing wearing a pair of socks emblazoned with a knitted motif of the black bat of Heron Hall. Truly Salah tired would I walk in the socks of the mighty cheered was I by this thought that I took my minions to the tavern for some celebrate hurry cruising. It was only mid afternoon, but they had acquitted themselves well and we're deserving of reward. Little did I know that shortly before we fetched up at that snug rustic hostelry, the unreconstructed Stalinist creeping away from it in his ass like way with Peter Baelish, though Lannisters Mackey evelle he had dripped poison into the air of the taverner and the taverner Turn, drip poison into our flagons of Grog. By teatime, my minions lay sprawled in the sawdust, dead and dying. And I myself was so sick, I could barely bring myself to scuff a second horse heart for dinner. But I forced it down and set off alone for the castle where in the minions of the pointy stick did their knitting. But in my weakened state, I became hopelessly lost. Last two is my memory of what happened. All I can remember, I remember is standing by the wall, the guns shot above our heads, and we kissed as though nothing could fall. Nothing could fall. Who was I kissing? Why? a minion of the pointy sticks and net woman who had rescued me from a ditch somewhere along the way, and had brought me to the wall. And it is here at the wall I have stayed, I no longer stake my claim to the Iron Throne. I am happy here fighting off wolves and wildlings listening to the falling snow. While my net woman, the minion of the pointy stick knits me sock after sock after sock after sock emblazoned with a motif of the black bat of Heron Hall. I am no king, but I trudge through snow deep in the socks of the mighty.

Frank Key  11:57
The minions of the pointy sticks is actually an existing a real and existing knitting group. If you don't believe me, you can look it up online. Put millions of the pointy sticks into Google and you'll find them and I discovered their existence. The other evening when I went to a kind of evening of knitting and cinema run by passenger films. And Truth of My interest was that part of the evening was a talk in title, nicking and catastrophe in the cinema. Who could resist the talk with such a title? Certainly not me, which is why I promised majestically through the South London street in freezing temperatures to go and listen to Jonathan fires explain all. Unfortunately, Dr. Fires turned out to be an academic. So his talk which contains some interesting and intriguing snippets was couched in dreadful brain numbing, postmodern gobbledygook. I realized that to carve out a career in modern academia, you have to talk and write like that. But how one yearns to hear a simple straightforward sentence. Instead it's all discourses interrogating notions of the other blob blob blob bollocks I think interrogate in its various forms popped out of Dr. fire's mouth half a dozen times. In little more than 20 minutes. I would happily have subjected him to a proper interrogation tied to a chair in a secret police basement with a Clyde light shoved in his face. Things were not helped by the fact that he was unable to master the technology to show us the film clips with which he meant to illustrate his bladder. These would have included scenes from the King of Comedy Martin Scorsese. 1983 Breakfast at Tiffany's, Blake, Edwards, 1961, Rosemary's Baby Roman Polanski, 1968, and Double Indemnity, Billy Wilder 1944. You see what I mean? It could have been very interesting indeed. In spite of all I do, applaud Dr. Fires for his title, nicking and catastrophe in the cinema, deserves its place in any list of highly amusing academic studies. Alongside the one I devised 30 years ago, in tandem with my then colleague, the journalist and television person Tracy McLeod, with plans to insert in a bibliography reference to a paper entitled topiary and miscegenation in contemporary cinema. Alas, it never appeared. For reasons I cannot Now recall

Frank Key  15:13
It occurs to me that perhaps the time has now come for me to write topiary and miscegenation in contemporary cinema. I bow have a bash at that. And one of Dobson's more preposterous follies was his attempt to rewrite Charles Montague doubt he's mad massive classic travels in Arabia desert 1888 What do you mean rewrite it asked marigold true. When the out of print pamphleteer announced his plan is in amaranta. Over breakfast one rain swept March morning. I mean, splattered Dobson, choking on a mouthful of goose fat toasty that I will enter daddy's head as it were, see what he saw. Hear what he heard. Smell the very same fumes his nostrils smelled. And from those sensual prods, I shall weave a spell of words to create a new and improved travels in Arabia deserter, no less mad. No less matters, but better, grander, more true. It's an intriguing if foolish idea, said marigold. True. But I wonder if you've thought it through. You will know from daddy's book, if not from other sources, that the desert is a vast and pitiless place of burning heat upon which the sun beat down relentlessly. You, meanwhile, are a man whose hatred of bright sunlight and hatred is not too strong a word has often led me to think you have the Constitution of a vampire. You are a man who thrives under overcast skies and in drizzle Dobson not a sun worshiper. Two point replied Dobson swallowing a fork full of shredded radish. First, I have not actually read daddy's book. Oh, I've skimmed it here and there gained a feel for it strange and highly wrought pros. Wait, it's mad mass in my hand, but I could not claim to be familiar with every last nook and cranny of the tech. Second, I do not intend actually to travel in the burning sands sands of the hellish sun bashed desert. If you listen carefully, you will have heard me say that my plan is to enter into daddy's head from the comfort of my spirit walk and summon forth the new Dobson eyes traveled in Arabia desert her through the majestic powers of imagination alone. And you will enter his head how asked marigold to. I snipped from a periodical a photograph of the Dowty head said Dobson. And I have a thick stick to the wall by my skirt wall with a drawing pin. As soon as I am done with breakfast, I shall sit and gaze at the picture in ordered concentration. And as I gaze slowly but surely the lineaments and integuments of the Dowty brain will become fused with my own brain and swimming before my eyes shall come wondrous mirages, mirages, after all of the stuff of travels in Arabia desert or are they not? And then I will take up my propelling pencil and scribble down in impassioned prose. All I see all I hear all I smell while that's entranced. My plan is sound, he concluded, and I shall give birth to a masterpiece. marigold to drained her beaker of milk slops, and turned her head to look out of the window at the downpour. Imagine here's some incidental music before we move on to the next part of the of the tale. It was still raining later in the afternoon when Dobson returned from a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal. He came crashing through the door sopping wet, leaving a trail of puddles in his wake. marigold to hide him carefully. Who is this come crashing through the door? she asked. Is it Dobson or Dowty or some zany mingling of both Dobson and Dowty? By way of reply, the pamphleteer merely granted. You are sopping wet and leaving a trail of puddles in your wake said marigold nobody could look less like they've been traveling in Arabia deserter. I'll put the kettle on.

Frank Key  20:08
As she went to the kitchen sink marigold to saw in the waste bin, the snipped out photograph of Charles Montague doubt his head torn in half and scrunched up. The hole pierced by Dobson's drawing pin visible in the center of the Dowty, forehead. Time for some more incidental music, and then we move on again. How are you getting on with your visionary rewriting asked marigold two that evening, as she and Dobson sprawled on the sofa. From the dansette on the sideboard came the finger tapping who char of Xavi a to get and his orchestra I may have to rethink my plan, said Dobson. Oh, I gazed and gazed at daddy's head for hours, said the pamphleteer. But only one mirage. Your vision came swimming into my head. I could neither replace it nor dislodge it. There is not enough material there for a mad and massive booking to volumes, which was what I hoped to be able to reap from the wild imaginings boiling in my double Dobson, Dowty brain. Instead, I will have to make do with a recipe book or rather, a recipe pamphlet for I have bought the one recipe that was my mirage. Well, people are always on the lookout for an exotic recipe. Dobson said marigold to get it scribbled down and I shall have it typeset in the morning on the guest stettner machine in the shed.

Frank Key  21:56
How stuffed camel ingredients. One whole camel medium size, one whole lamb large size 20 hold chickens, medium size 60 eggs 12 kilograms of rice, two kilograms of pine nut, two kilograms of almonds, one kilogram of pistachio nuts 110 gallons of water, five pounds of black pepper and salt method skin trim and clean the camel the lamb and the chicken boil until tender. cook rice until fluffy fry knots until brown and mix with rice hard boiled eggs and pail stuff cooked chicken with hard boiled eggs and rice. Stuff cooked lamb with stuffed chickens. Add more rice. Stuff the camel with the stuffed lamb and add the rest of the rice. boil over a large charcoal pit until Brown. Spread any remaining rice on large tray and place camel on top rice. Decorate with boiled eggs and nuts served 80 to 100 famished travelers in Arabia desert.

Frank Key  23:52
I would like to point out that that is a genuine recipe brought to my attention by James Beckett to whom many thanks I don't think James has ever actually eaten whole stuffed camel. If you were making a note of the ingredients please do note that it does say medium sized camel. Everything could go horribly wrong if you use a small or large Kamil, medium size. All of us I suspect can remember vividly the moment we heard that David Miliband had resigned his parliamentary seat in this age of the information superhighway. The news circled the globe with unprecedented speed. While bustling Western cities came to a standstill as sophisticated urbanites tried to come to terms with the shock. eerily similar themes were played out among previously uncontacted tribes people in the deepest recesses of the Amazon jungle, seldom in history, as a single event reverberated among so many people. Miliband himself had an inkling of the reaction he would provoke. He rightly pointed out that the rivalry between him and his brother, whose name I can't quite recall, it's so profoundly fascinating that it distracts the media, and indeed everybody else from the real and important issues of the day. And one might add from the unimportant issues too. For myself, I know there have been many. sorry for myself. I know there have been innumerable occasions when I've neglected pressing personal matters, because I was so fixated upon the Miliband brothers only the other day, for example, I completely forgot to tie my shoelaces before leaving the house, fretting as I was about the tangled relationship of the brothers. With the result that I tripped over and banged my head and had to be carted off to an emergency dropping clinic for a brain scan. And I'm not alone. In the strangely muted hours and days since the news came in. Stories pour in from around the world as people try to express their feelings about the shock resignation. A typical example comes from Abdul be speaking from his hovel in a shanty town in a third world hellhole. I remember exactly where I was when I heard the shattering news about David Miliband resignation, he said, the tears not yet dry on his cheeks. But somehow, I feel happy as well as grief stricken. Now with only a single Miliband involved in British political life, I will no longer be fatally distracted by the deeply fascinating rivalry between David and his brother. And I might be able to spend more time caring for my family and my goats and my patch of pitiful scrub land. concerns have been raised that the gaping hole left in the British polity, or at least in a small corner of it somewhere north could destabilize the entire Eurozone and beyond. I wondered why all those Cypriots were desperately trying to take their money out of the banks said one expert wild eyed balloon. And now I know obviously Miliband took them the Wink. They knew what was coming. That will not be the only conspiracy theory to emerge in the coming weeks and months. Indeed, there is every possibility that 50 years hence, the fraternal Miliband rivalry will still cast a spell of the millions and entire publishing industry having been spawned to cater for the eternal fascination with David and his brother, whose name is on the tip of my tongue.
