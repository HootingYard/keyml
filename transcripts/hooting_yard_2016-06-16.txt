Hello, this is Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. I think I'm about to sneeze. That was a good start to the show, wasn't it? Um, hang on, hang on a second.

This is the live resonance experience, which may involve me doing a lot of coughing, spluttering, sneezing and making similar better deal noises. This is hooting out on the air, you know that show where I read to you. And last week I was reading about when I was given an ogs be steering panel for my birthday. And I didn't have time to finish that. So I'm going to finish reading that now. cast your mind back. I was a child and I had just been given a hat for a present. And my mother told me that I should go and unwrap the rectangular package at the foot of my bed. I ran upstairs and tore open the rectangular newspaper wrapped package at the foot of my bed. Is it possible to convey to you the shared joy with which my entire being was convulsed? When I saw that I had been given an original series oglesby's steering panel. There it was new and gleaming with its little knobs and leavers and the red Bakelite prom on one side and the rubber speaking funnel on the other, the Braille like raised round nodes next to the hooter the metal snags, the clip on flaps, and so many many dials. I think I played with it constantly for the next three hours, until we're terrible moment when my father suddenly crashed through the door of my room. ashen faced and trembling, and tall the original series oglesby's a steering panel for my puny little hands.

I have had to get back here suddenly, son, he said in a voice broken by strain. Our powerful ruthless and fiendish enemy is within minutes of unleashing a plot so intricate, so tangled, just so damn bonkers, that the very future of the globe is in direct peril. Only by dismantling your new original series ogs be staring panel and using the parts for our top secret counter attack machine. will the world be saved to guarantee that children like you have a free from fear of all that is fiendish I'm sure you understand. And he was gone. And I was left alone on the floor of my room, cuter fallen pious. And I never saw my birthday gift again. Oh yes, the world was saved. The powerful and ruthless and fiendish enemy was foiled by heroic father resumed his humble potato shop person persona. And my mother eradicated all insect life from our domain. But I always felt a sense of unbearable loss. Until last week, when I stumbled upon an original series ogs be steering panels hidden behind an array of Pappy and mash a dustbin lids in this veil of tears in that gloomy alley in pointy town, and the long insufferable melancholy years was swept away, and I was 10 again, with icicles in my hair.

Speaking of hair, not with icicles in it, but in terms of personal grooming, I've always set great store by the pudding basin haircut. It's an effortlessly stylish look achieved by having a pudding basin attended over one bonds, while one barber snipped away any hair protruding below the rim. Obviously, before putting the pudding basin in place, the hair is combed in a uniformly downwards direction from a central point at the apex of the head. If you wish to avail yourself of a pudding bison haircut, and I would strongly advise you to do so there are a few things to bear in mind. Before donning your boots and wind treater and heading out to the barbers, you should ascertain whether he supplies his own pudding basin. This is particularly the case if the size of your head strays from the human norm. If you have an unusually large head, or an abnormally tiny one, a standard size pudding basin will result in a very stupid haircut in the circumstances, or if your barber does not supply his own pudding basin. Be sure to take one with you. But before leaving the house, check that your pudding basin has been thoroughly cleaned. Since last you used it for making a pudding. Failing to do so might find you leaving the barbers later. With your new haircut splattered with bits of say sago pudding. You will be extremely fortunate to make it home without being beset by birds swooping down upon your head and pecking at your hair with their sharp, fearsome beaks intent on gobbling up every last scrap of sago pudding, which most birds find irresistible. This Savage packing is also likely to cause catastrophic damage to your brand new haircut, and you'll probably have to turn around and go straight back to the barbers so he can snip snip snip it into some semblance of tidiness and style. He may not, however, be able to retrieve that enviable putting base and look you left with a few minutes earlier. Also, unless things are particularly generous Barber, you'll have to pay him twice. And all because you neglected to scrub every last smidgen of psycho pudding from your pudding basin. By the same token, make sure you wash the pudding base and when you get home, or at least before you Next use it for pudding preparation. A stray hair or two may add here to the inside of the basin and thus find its way into your pudding. This could result in dinner party calamity, and you will become an object of disgust to your guests. Not a not even that effortlessly stylish pudding bass and haircut cut will save you from consequences social disgrace and possible criminal prosecution.

There are many hunting yard characters who've been introduced over the years Dobson the out of print pamphleteer Of course, marigold to tiny Enid shakha pebble head, but one of my favorites is detective Captain unscrambled towel. I don't write much about him He first appeared as long ago as the last century. In an old malice aforethought press pamphlet called the immense duck pond pamphlet, and here's how he was introduced over 20 years ago. The next day all hell broke loose early in the morning Blodgett polished the outside spigots an ogre, or wild man Hove interview atop the southern hills. Its progress towards the house was implacable. It stamped through the Bracken vaulted the haha with a single bound, negotiated the massive bass old wall with surprising elegance and sprang towards the terrified Blodgett, whirling it hirsute arms alarmingly, and making disgusting guttural noises. It was matted with filth, flies, gnats, and tiny things emitting poisonous goo crawled all over it flesh. It seemed to be decomposing. It drooled it picked up, Blodgett sank its fangs into his skull, and hold him aside. pausing momentarily to spit out particles of Blodgett head, smashed its way through the wall of the house, oblivious to the fact that there was no jar door three feet to it right. Once inside the house, its rage seemed to increase rushed wildly from room to room, obliterating the furniture, tearing up floorboard destroying shandur is bashing holes into walls and ceilings, sucking the wallpaper off the walls. It chewed up Bannister rails and regurgitated them, discouraging them with such force that each rail acted as a lethal projectile. At least one of the ergens was impaled as a result. Fire five minutes after the ogres arrival, much of the lower part of the house lay in ruins. small fires were starting, but they were doused by water spurting from uprooted taps. You could go under trouble was still sprawled in the bittern room. When the ogre eventually came upon them. It let out and in human cry, it picked it it soars, it became becalmed, fixing it with a bemused stare Jabal rose to his feet. You know, there might still be some grog left, he said, Would you care for a drop? The ogre pounded his fist against its own head. Then it blinked. shuddered, twitched. Double push the 10 mega grog into it, pour the ogre dealt the sweet muck down greedily, then threw the mug back at juggle, missing his ear by a whisker. Something in its manner seemed to change. By now blind you ago to was on her feet. She sniffed at the violent pongs emanating from the ogre, then stepped towards it. Thank heaven. You have come, she said. juggle. Meet my dear friend, Detective Captain unscrambled Taub. He comes from a far country and his brain is hot.

Going back. Well, that was that was from the last century. This is from earlier in this century. This is about 10 years ago. 10 years ago, I got a letter from hooting yards and tippity and researcher Glenn Webster. dear uncle Dan, he wrote, recently my dreams have been full of boredom and drudgery. The work is hard, the company is dull, and I'm thoroughly relieved to open my eyes in the morning. Sometimes I wake up to find myself hauling my body out of the bed, the way a shipwrecked sailor might haul himself for sure. What is happening to me, yours in all simplicity, Glen. very devoted hooting yard listeners may remember uncle Dan to whom It was addressed. I've used a pen a column here in titled, ask uncle Dan. He was always generous with his advice on matters such as leaks them and allow a bag full of crocus's. And you can revisit his wise words by going to the hooting yard website and checking under uncle Dan in the search engine. Last this doyin of agony uncle's is no longer with us. I always wondered what had happened to him. And coincidentally, on the very day I found Mr. Webster's old letter from 2006 the post person sack also contained this missive. Dear Mr. Key, you don't know me and I prefer to remain anonymous. I can tell you that I have a waxed mustache. But I hope you will not take the same view as Robert Baden Powell, who wrote I was once accused of mistrusting men with waxed mustaches. Well, so to a certain extent I do. It often means vanity and sometimes crink Well, I'm not vain and I drink only lukewarm tap water, dandelion and burdock, and occasionally tiser I try not to pre mine the stash overmatch but I confess that waxing it has always been a small pleasure of mine. And Lord knows I deserve a small measure of pleasure as who does not. But to business. I'm writing to pass on to you greetings from a fellow I met up in the hills last Thursday. Like me, he was unwilling to divulge his name, but he said that you would know who he was. He was dressed in billowing cloth, which looked as if once it had been a parachute or part of the parachute, and his face had the palate of beancurd he to sported a waxed moustache, but I did not smell drink on his breath. Nor did he seem to be puffed up with vanity. It makes one wonder if Baden Powell has any kind of grip on reality, quite frankly. Anyway, as I say, we were up in the hills this fellow and I he was standing up right on a boulder, peering intently at a speck in the sky in the far distance. What do you see? I asked, when I was close enough for him to hear me above the wild and wailing wind. For answer. He made a pointed and I turned to look at the unmoving spec. Neither of us had binoculars More's the pity. That's spec, he said suddenly, in a voice which curiously reminded me of television presented Dale Winton. That spec is what I see. I have been watching it for three hours. And it has not moved. It is a very mysterious spec. I offered him a plum from my fruit bag, but he refused it because he said it was bruised, and he would not eat bruised plums. Instead, he took a surgeon's biscuit from some pocket or pouch concealed within his billowing cloth and began curing on it. The wind was howling with even more violence now, and I bid the man come shelter with me in an ornithologist through there. I knew of not 100 paces away. He jumped down from this perch on the boulder with surprising sprightliness and then took me by the arm. It was an overfamiliar, yet somehow reassuring gesture.

And so we sat in the Lair me with my plums and he with his biscuits, and we waited for the wind in the hills to die down. To pass the time. We've played a game of tea strainers improvising with broken twigs. When we parted an hour or so later, he returned to his Boulder, and pointed out that the unmoving speck was still there. I looked, but now I could not see it. I printed my waxed moustache, and said farewell, but not before promising to write to you, Mr. Key. Yours faithfully, Mr. X. There is no doubt in my mind that the man my anonymous correspondent met in the hills with Uncle Dan. He was always seeing little specks in the sky that were invisible to everyone else, and was forever lamenting that in all his years as an aggregate Uncle no one ever wrote in reporting a similar experience. I once asked him how he would reply if someone did, and he muttered something in his Dale Winton voice about paralyzed chaffinches caught and cushioned in air pockets. Ask for green Webster's heartfelt plea. I've placed it in a cardboard box, along with many other unanswered letters to Uncle Dan. One may one day he may return to us in his billowing cloth, with his wax moustache, and his paler of beancurd. And his mighty towering wisdom.

I just thought I'd drop in here are a couple of facts about the Estonian language, one of which is that whole means mad and they refer to the king as the shoe. If you're suspected of having committed a crime and are placed under arrest by law enforcement officers never provide an alibi, which is bonkers. This advice holds true whether you're innocent or guilty, or even in that gray area between the two like a caca character. Let's assume for the purposes of our argument that you were indeed the shady limping figure. Eyewitnesses recalled seeing emerging from the pastry shop, clutching a handful of banknotes, fresh from the open till over which is now slumped the grievously but not fatally wounded pastry shop proprietor. The pastry shop is a couple of miles north of budget spinny. In that little arcade known as the one time haunted flappers, you motored away in the sidecar of your accomplices getaway motorbike, and just 20 minutes later, you were sat in the snog of the cow and pins squandering your dishonestly obtained bank notes on bottled stout when the police come to a rescue, whether it be that very day, or weeks, months, or even years hence, do not say. At the time of the pastry shop robbery, I was clambering up a mountainside in the Himalayas, carrying a crate of exotic perfumes in preparation for a long overdue performance of scribbins. unfinished work mysterium officer. This is what we call a bonkers alibi. It's needlessly embroidered, easily disproved, and demonstrably untrue. Also, many Tavern goers will have seen you swimming stout in the cow and pins within half an hour of the pastry shop robbery. And you could not have been in the Himalayan mountain range at that time. Unless you have access to an exciting Space Age mode of transport, which does not yet exist. I know that we were all promised our own personal booster jet packs by jet back boosted. I know that we were all promised our own personal boosterjet backpacks by about 1967. But it didn't happen. Equally you should be aware of using a bonkers alibi if you're accused of a crime of which you are wholly innocent. In these cases, telling the truth is by far the best option. Imagine you're sitting at home one day feet up reading celebrity pap magazine to find out the latest doings of stegen full Gen CEO and Agamemnon or knobel or perhaps other lesser known celebrities, ones with besmirched careers or no careers at all. Suddenly smashing their way through your window comes a heavily armed SWAT team Excuse me, suddenly smashing their way through your window, comes a heavily armed SWAT team. descending on rope ladders from this sinister black helicopter. a hoot is pulled over your head. And by the time it's removed, you're sitting on a chair in a basement. You know not were being interrogated about your participation in the slaying of president john F. Kennedy in Dallas on the 22nd of November 1963. Now, remember, you were not there. At the time of the shooting 53 years ago, you were paddling in the brackish water of fiendish inky black pond with other tops from an orphanage. So it would be completely bonkers for your alibi to be. I was standing in Dealey Plaza next to umbrella man, or perhaps Mary Moon Man, and then I strolled over to the white picket fence, where I shook the gunpowder stained the hand of bad man, and then I walked off towards the cripple, underpass, and stemmons freeway officer.

Quick as a flash, your interrogators will arrange for a screeches screening of the Zapruder footage. Find out that you've been lying through your teeth and charging with being part of a huge conspiracy and cover up on all of this because you gave a bonkers. Next week, we'll look at 11th hour plea bargains.

Finally this week, oh, well, before we go, always a reminder to go and look at the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org and there's lots to read lots of pictures to look at books to buy all sorts of things, and a huge huge archive of material. So you could probably spend possibly the next eight or nine years just reading that will end with a quotation from Southwest or Lal Keough, his book, The artificial kingdom, a treasury of the kings experience with remarkable objects of art and nature, extraordinary events, eccentric biography and original theory, plus many wonderful illustrations selected by the author and a very good book it is the artificial kingdom. Anyway. She writes. among the earliest natural Marvels that modernity inherited from the Middle Ages, were embalmed crocodiles, brought to a wide eyed Europe as part of the Crusaders and loot, and promptly baptized as miracles by the church in an attempt to diffuse the growing popularity of bizarre phenomena, torn away from their original context, and endowed with a symbolism that rendered them a product of divine intervention. The crocodiles were tied with chains and hung from church ceilings, where they acted both as signs of the mystery of the mysteries of divine power, and as guardians that could thwart all other evils. I must say, I'd like to go into a church and see an embalmed crocodile hanging from the ceiling by trains. But I've never seen such a thing. And maybe one day I will, possibly before next week, when I'll be back. Bye bye.
