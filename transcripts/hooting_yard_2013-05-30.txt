Hello pickers, this is hooting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM, or resonance fm.com. Live from Barrow High Street in London. My name is Frank key, and I wasn't here last week because I was felled by the common cold, or possibly flu anyway, felt pretty wretched. And in some ways, I still do. But I had something to read to you last week, which last week was sort of topical. And of course with the passage of time, it becomes less topical, but I'm going to read it to you anyway. It's concerning well, begins by mentioning the Eurovision Song Contest. For those of you with a short memory span, that was a Eurovision Song Contest that took place a couple of weeks ago. Anyway, you can learn many things by watching the origin Song Contest. And one of the things I learned this year was I must confess that I didn't know how to pronounce malama correctly, otherwise thought that they these, Malmo is the southern capital of sweden. And I'd always thought that the final Oh, rhymed with dough, but now I know that it's more accurately sort of, or sound. Anyway, this new knowledge led me by ways I will not bother to explain to devise a plan for an exciting piece of musical theater. Now, I haven't studied the life and times of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi with any great diligence, nor indeed with any diligence at all. What I know of the light tyrant was picked up from news reports print and broadcast over the years, so I have no idea whether he ever paid a visit to Sweden. And if he did not, it doesn't matter, for my musical can be wholly fictional. The basic premise of my all singing all dancing show is that Gaddafi on a visit to Malmo is presented by the good burgers of that city with an offering of murder. I realized this has connotations of the baby Jesus being presented with murder, along with golden frankincense, by the three kings of Ori on tar. And as a result, my show might be accused of blasphemy. Well Bring it on, as they say. We're all aware that blasphemy is a splendid way to drum up publicity, and krisztian blasphemy is nice and safe, and wind plaudits for being edgy from the guardian. Unlike blasphemy against Islam, which gets you blown up or beheaded, and accused of being racist by The Guardian. The main well the only reason I have devised this show, however, is as a pretext for the title rammers Bible murmur that has a pleasing ring does it not? The great thing about it is that however clearly and resoundingly you try to enunciate the words rammers mild murmur you still sound like a toothless inarticulate wrench.

So anyway, Yes, I was. I was not well, and I lay there whimpering and I didn't write very much in in the in the time when I was in college, annotated. But what I did, I did read a few things and one of the things I read was that very I was interested to note that the 2013 Man Booker International Prize was awarded to Lydia Davis. She's a writer who specializes in very, very short stories. So short they make my own effusions seem like mighty epics. Could it be that the hermetic and blinkered literary world is that last opening up to the old on the unfamiliar. I don't know Lydia Davis his work. Other than there was a small selection of stories which appeared in the print edition of The Guardian over the weekend. But I'm heartened by her success. It may prompt publishers to be just a tad more adventurous, and who knows, I might not be told, as I have been more than once that I have absolutely no commercial potential whatsoever, such as the travails of your devout, devoted Scribbler. I'm afraid anyway, to that end, and also as a way of emerging from the influenza that or common cold, that's still my pen for a week or so. I thought I might have a bash a few shorter than usual stories. It's clearly the way to go. Given that in an accompanying piece in the weekend Guardian, someone called Allie Smith claimed Lydia Davis to be and I quote, as mighty as Kapha as subtle as Flo bear as epoch making as Proust unquote, gosh, is that hyperbole or what? By adopting Lydia Davis's preferred form. I do not of course place myself in such illustrious company. I know I'm better than that. I echo Raymond Roussel who wrote my fame without shine that of Victor Hugo on the Polian for both Raymond Roussel and I have what he called the sacred flame of genius, which makes the one chosen by it so arrogant, that he finds the very stars in the sky pitiful compared with the new star that burns upon his forehead. So there you go. So I'm going to read you some of the some of the stories that I've been writing over the last few days, since I was inspired to write again by keeping things very short. This is called hot zinc. I used to know a man whose name unusually was hot zinc. His character was equally rum. He must had much in Dutch, while twisting twigs into dollies. Angular and emaciated they were frightening dollies quite unsuitable for the tiny tots, who formed the standard Dolly demographic. The airbag in his car was of a wholly new type. It was devised by his cousin. He had dozens of cousins, and the name of the airbag designer was oath drib, which is an anagram of bird flew off was a fat fellow, who looked as if several of his airbags had exploded within him. In May 1968, he threw a pebble at a policeman in Paris, youthful folly. Now he was fat and comfortable and was raw, unable to manipulate air in wondrous ways. It was a good thing he did for his cousin hot zinc was a terrible driver. He plowed into a gaggle of swans beside a canal. The prototype new airbag safety's life, the swans, not

two more very short pieces. first one's very short. before reading it, I should remind you, you probably don't need to be reminded of this, but I should remind you that James Joyce always referred to his book. Ulysses as ooh lysis Joyce called the book ooh lysis clench your fist in such a way that when held up against a beam of light and casting shadow upon the wall, it resembles in silhouette, a stately plump person. Why? As I live and breathe this back Mulligan This is the first step to master should you be determined to interpret to James Joyce's ooh lysis through the medium of shadow puppetry, further instructions to follow.

And this next story is called slow dog. There's a song by Tanja Donnelly's group belly called slow dog. I do not think I had ever appreciated how slow a dog could be until yesterday, when I saw walking along the pavement and exceedingly slow dog attached to a leash, one end of which was held firmly by the dog's owner who was walking at an equally and arrestingly slow pace. In fact, the pair of them were so slow, that at first glance, I thought they were immobile posing on the pavement in Tableau vivaan, as if to illustrate the subject, person with Dog. On further inspection, however, it became clear that they were both walking along, but imperceptibly, imperceptibly. I'm not familiar with all the different breeds of dog in the world. But in this instance, I am prepared to go out on a limb and state clearly and decisively that the dog was a mass diff. I passed them by and went about my business, a series of errands which took me in turn, to a tobacconist and ironmongery and a post office. Coming out of the post office, I saw something across the road, which defied description. Nevertheless, fresh from my triumph, but identifying a massive among innumerable doc types, I'm going to attempt to describe it, it was indescribably nondescript. That being so I paid it no further attention, turned on my heel and made my way home. When I passed the slow dog and its master, they had progressed perhaps an inch or two along the pavement. home, I decided to listen to the belly record, Tanja Donnelly things that her slow dog has see through skin, the kind of skin you can see through. This was not the case with the slow Mastiff I saw. So she must have been singing about a different dog entirely. It would be interesting to know which one was the slower

Excuse me, I don't often attempt impersonations for good reason, because I don't think I'm particularly good at them. But I would like now to say a brief impersonation, which I hope is vividly convincing of Richard Burton. broadsword calling Danny Boy broadsword, calling Danny boy. Apart from Danny boy comes no word, for he has become muzzle headed, and sped off in a Bonny boat over the Sea to Sky. One must not be equally muddle headed, and confuse that sky with the blue blue Tyrolean sky beneath which, dressed all in white, the better to camouflage himself. broadsword perches on an Alpine match. Tim declivity calling, calling hopelessly into his radio transmitter. The mountain slopes are thick with Nazis. The pipes the pipes are calling the Nazis to now our model headed and they follow the dulcet tooting of the pipes. Like children following the Pied Piper of Hamelin

Frank Key  15:33
broadsword is safe from the Nazis for the time being. He packed up his radio transmitter and hoist it on his back and carried it down down to a janitorial shed near the railway tracks. Above, in the blue, blue sky, an Eagles whoops. The eagle is not a broadsword nor Danny boy. It is an eagle with no name. Just as in America, far from the Tarot. There is a horse with no name, just as here, coming into the janitorial shed to join broadsword is the man with no name. Later, that will be much gunfire.

Well, we've had a slow dog. And in the next story, we have a lazy dog. The lazy dog might be slow as well, but it's a lazy dog. The story is called The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The fox is being pursued by tally hurrying hunters on horseback. It is so quick a fox that it is soon out of sight, having scurried under a hedge and leaped over a dick, and a way away. But the lazy dog is now sure to be crushed under the hooves of galloping horses, unless it moves out of their path. It is a dog equivalent of pole white star of the silver screen, who sometimes found herself tied to railway lines as huge locomotives thundered implacably towards her. Except that no ropes tied, except that no ropes tie the dog down, merely its own lassitude. The awful sound of the approaching hooves wakes the lazy dog. It has been asleep, dreaming about whatever dogs dream about. It was quite oblivious to the quick brown fox which jumped over it at the beginning of our story. Now it opens one doggy AI appears towards the source of the den which has woken it shifting its fat bulk oh so slightly on the grass. It lifts one diffident poor in a gesture designed to hold the horses in a gallop. Think of a station master holding up a flag to hold a train.

If this were a transcript of an episode of a poor white cereal, we would end here, leaving you in suspense. But just as the cinema tech audience knows, deep down that Paul White will not actually be killed under the wheels of the thundering locomotive. So you know, deep down Don't you that Mr. Key would never gratuitously kill a dog, even a lazy fictional dog. So what happens is that astonishingly, each individual horse spots the raised poor of the lazy dog on the lawn, and comes to a jarring stop in spite of the tally howling promptings of its rider. Indeed, so sudden is the horse is halting, that some of the riders are pitched forward and thrown from their mouth.

Frank Key  19:57
The lazy dog goes back to sleep. The toppled, hunters rub their sprains and bruises. The horses make standard horsey noises and pat about as horses do when left to their own devices. Far, far away, The quick brown fox is still going like the clappers is heading towards the railway line.

I don't want to advertise a different radio station on resonance, which of course is the greatest radio station ever in the history of the world. But there is a pretty good program on BBC Radio for the moment. You have to get up at about two minutes to six in the morning to listen to it, which I always do. And I'm not kidding. It's called tweet of the day. And it's two minutes of birdsong. And David Attenborough telling you about the bird. Absolutely brilliant program. Best thing on the BBC worth the licence fee alone. Anyway. According to David Attenborough on tweet of the day the other day, that makes sense tweet of the day, the other day earlier in the week, I'll start again, according to David Attenborough, on tweet of the day earlier this week. The sound made by the storm petrel has been described as, like a fairy being sick. Conversely, in lands of fairy, for example, in cottingley, where the fairies are made of paper, a fairy being sick is compared to Western petrol. One might find it hard to imagine a ferry, especially a paper, one vomiting. But the land of ferry is mostly invisible to most of us. It's a parallel world where could we see it much would be familiar to us, or be skewed and distorted? So yes, fairies are sometimes sick, just as we're sometimes sick. But what they vomit up is not the same as what we vomit up. And yes, fairies shop for groceries in supermarkets, with an increasing number of self service tills, but they buy different groceries in supermarkets, which only dimly resemble our own. And the protocol for the Self Service tills is like something from the 14th century. ferries travel on buses, but not on our buses. I could go on. Do you want me to go on? Or would you rather I shut up, so you can put on a pair of stout walking boots, and hike out to the seaside in hopes of finding a colony of storm petrels. So you can make a tape recording of their cries, and later, back home played while reading a bedtime story to your tinies that much loved story from your own childhood. The one about the Oso delightful, flattering paper fairy that caught a stomach bug and vomited up a mess of fairy pottage into a fairy bucket in a little fairy cottage in cottingley. And they called for a doctor and the doctor who came hurrying across the fields with his black bag was Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle.

There's something very odd going on in the orchard. At night after sunset there is a curious hubbub. It's the sound of talking fruit hanging from their branches. The orchard fruits chatter away in the darkness. Each has a characteristic tone. The apples are shrill, the pair's engaged in terrains, the persimmons matter. All the fruits talk constantly and simultaneously so it's extremely difficult to decipher a word any of them is saying, even if we understood their languages are any of them listening to each other? Or are they just babbling incoherently oblivious to their fellow fruits? Why did they wait to speak until nightfall By the fallen fruits silent. Why does nobody come to gather the fallen fruits from the orchard floor? Why are they left to rot? It's the most curious of orchards over there beyond the railway track and the viaduct surrounded by sick thorny hedges, in which no bird will ever nest.

The thing about these very short pieces is he can just bash them out, you know, I mean, in four days, I've written eight of them, two per day. So who knows where this will end. Finally, this week, then the last of the short, short stories that I've been writing. And we've had two dogs, a slow dog and a lazy dog. So it's time we have a cat. And this piece is called cat. Curiosity killed the cat. But a cat has nine lives. So 1234567 or even eight instances of overweening and perilous curiosity will not prove ultimately fatal. It's the ninth instance that a cat has to worry about. But it will not worry, because it's in a Radek. kabuli stupid. And that's when it's curiosity is piqued for the ninth time, by a stray strand of string, or a miniscule insect creeping along the wainscot. The cat will not pause to consider that this time Ah, this time, there will be no coming back from the death it's Daly's with. It's not that the cat is brave, reckless, Valiant. It is stupid, and it cannot count. You will do well even if you care for a cat and wish to protect it from harm. To teach it elementary arithmetic. Place the cat on a stool and arm yourself with a series of flashcards on which the digits from one to nine are written in clear big, bold black sans serif You need not bother with zero. No cat's brain could ever cope with that concept. The instruction of cat can prove highly exasperating. So you're advised to take some sort of bottled cognitive elixir before starting drum the digits and their significance into the cat bonds. Check its progress with regular test if it leaves the stall, for example, to pursue a stray strand of string or a miniscule insect on the wainscot, or worth a birdie in the garden, hold it back, replace it on the stall and give it a ticking off. Be warned that there is every possibility you will die before the cat has grasped the essentials. But you will die happy in the knowledge that you preserve the cat from harm for as long as you could. And that you left your considerable fortune to it in your last will and testament to ensure the cat wants for nothing in this mortal world. So you can all try that before next week's show. Whether I'll still be writing very short pieces, or longer ones, I don't know. But I'll be back next week. In either case. Bye bye.
