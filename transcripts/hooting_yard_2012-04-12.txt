Good evening. It's hooting, it's a yard. And it's on the air. And my name is Frank key. And if I knew the first thing about the ballet, I would tell you all about crapping jewels groundbreaking work, King graspers Castle, it's electrical wiring system. It's janitor, and it's shutter lane. It was literally a groundbreaking ballet, in that some of the steps choreographed involved tremendously heavy thumping in big boots upon cake to mud. But, alas and alack I completely lack ballet chops. So instead I'll turn my attention to King Jasper's castle, its electrical wiring system, its janitor and its shadowline the play by pickles on which the ballet is based. My source is basing ballets on pickles plays a study of crepin Joe and his followers in the crepin jurists school by Beth Blunkett, the noted balletto main and crepin jurist best press on before I get bogged down in further follow the role, the plot of King graspers Castle, etc, etc. It's so convoluted that I'm not going to attempt to summarize it here. What you need to know is that the setting is a castle belonging to King Jasper situated on a bleak promontory overlooking a bleaker See, the castle's electrical wiring system is as complicated as the plot of the play, if not more, so. Its maintenance and seemingly endless tweaking and repair is the responsibility of the janitor who is employed by the castle's shatter line. Neither the janitor nor the shatter line has a given name, though whether this is an oversight on pickles part, or an Oso clever literary device is moot. arguments have been thrashed out on both sides. There are other pickles plays with nameless characters. Somewhere characters swap their names around between x and several where though Every character has a name. Those names are unpronounceable in any human tongue, or indeed in bestie, or grunts, house or birdsong. Not for nothing is pickles labeled a difficult playwright, Justice he was called a difficult child by those paid to watch over him in his infancy. But King, Dracula's castle, etc, etc, is not in itself a difficult play for other actors audience. Indeed, it's often the case that the cast whether professional or amateur, will dispense with rehearsals entirely and simply jump onto a stage and prompt you and start performing it. The only people who are disconcerted by this are the scene shifters who become all a desert. Still, from what I've read, that's only to be expected of scene shifters. Say for example, Biff blankets, magisterial study, dithering scene shifters in theatrical performances of pickles plays. That said, pickles has to bear some responsibility for the dithering, for his plays have become the tortoise among scene shifters for their rapid and bewildering shifts of scene in King grasp of castle, etc, etc. For example, act one alone requires 22 different sets in its seven separate scenes, as can be tabulated by a competent tabulator with an eagle eye on the script as follows. Scene one, the pantry in King Jasper's castle, a greyhound racing Stadium, hotel lobby, the castle drawbridge scene to electrical wiring cupboard in the castle plague pit, castle balcony. Scene three. Hell scene for the Bates Motel. Interior of a giant Jiffy bag, apple orchard, Pear orchard, jetty. Scene five. The castle Lada the castle ooh berliet the OK Corral. persimmon orchard. shadowline boud voir seen six Uncle Tom's Cabin King graspers cabin, janitors cubby

scene seven, the great hall of King Jasper's castle. Those of you who have not seen the play might infer from this competently tabulated tabulation, that it must be hard to follow the action what we so many changes have seen, even as we can see within the same scene, to the point where one falls calls into question quite what pickles meant by the word seen in the first place. But that would be to underestimate the sheer dreaminess of pickles is stage craft. Also, if you have not actually seen the plain performance, you would have no appreciation of it's exceedingly slow pace. Think snails and lanes snails at that. snails on crutches, snails on crutches, battling against the Gale Force wind up hill as a steep gradient. Think even steeper. Why then does a critic as acute as Beth Blunkett insist more than once that the play quote fairly rattles along? unquote? Is he a truth rather than a cute? Is he a fool? Has he been watching a completely different play all this time? That's a possibility. It's not only seen shifted to get all a desert in the face of pickles is dramaturgy, but the printers of playbills and publicity posters to Blunkett himself has written a magnificent and coruscating study of this very issue in his a magnificent and coruscating study of the issue of dithering playbill and publicity posters, printers or pickles plays if you only read one of Biff blunkett's verbose and prolix spouting, this is the one worthy of your attention. The chapter in which he sounds a warning regarding the tendency to confuse King Jasper's castle, its electrical wiring system, its janitor, and its shadowline with pickles his companion piece King Jasper's castle, its gas mandals its shadow lane and its janitor is particularly magnificent, though not quite as coruscating as it might be all things considered. Among the things considered should be the fact that Blunkett was bedridden with double pneumonia and a collapsed lung when he wrote it. Rumors are afoot that a young hothead crepin jurist is at work on a ballet based on King Jasper's castle. Its gas mantle's its shadow lane and its janitor. If so, that will be something to see. At least for balletto mains. The rest of us can spend a profitable evening queuing up at a soup kitchen.

So last, so hopelessly lost Is he in the piece super of history that very few people today, realize King Jasper of the pickles play King Jasper's castle, its electrical wiring system, its janitor, and its shadowline and of its companion piece, King Jasper's castle. Its gas mantle's its shadow lane and its janitor. And it's lighter adaptation as a ballet by crapping jaw, was a real person of the past. Whether he was a real King, his mood, as we shall see, but there is no doubt at all that King Jasper existed. his bones rest in a box in my allotment shed. I came by the bone through a secret network of Kings bones collectors. It's not so secret. Now. I've told you about it. We do our collecting underground in the shadows and the cover of night far from places where common folk tramp. It's highly unlikely you ever seen us at work collecting bones of kings and trading them among us? selves. A couple of ribs from King x might be swapped for a female femur from King y. More often than you might imagine, the bones of a king will be scattered hither and yon. If his throne was usurped by a wicked nephew, for example, a toppled King when killed might be chopped to bits, and those bits buried in pits spots dispersed across the kingdom. The wicked nephew will arrange this and pay off the grave diggers accordingly, in fear of vengeance from beyond the realm of death. He will have been brought up on tales of grisly and ghostly Avengers heard at his governesses knee, he will believe that only by scattering far and wide of the king's bones, can he avert an awful fight. Even when a king dies at peace in his bed, or accidentally after a surgery to lampreys, his bones may still be scattered. buried with all jus pomp of a piece in one place, the dead kings corpse will feed the worms and rot. And when all that remains is a heap of bones, it can happen that the grave will be opened at dead of night by ignorant peasants imbued in rustic poverty. The peasants will not have been brought up by governesses, but they will have heard the weird Tales of the village Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman, and believe in the talismanic properties of kingly bones. So, fighting and squabbling over the open royal grave, each peasant will snatch a bone or two, and carry them away to be hung on a nail on the wall of their hovel as a lucky charm. And later, when their villages are laid waste by marauding barons or barbarians, or both, the bones along with all the other pitiful belongings of the peasants will be scattered and strewn across the burning ruination of the land. I would not claim that we kings bones collectors act from some mystical belief that by uniting the scattered bones of a particular King, we're somehow calling him back from the dead. Perhaps one or two of my fellow kings, bones collectors entertain such delusions. The rest of us are simply collectors, as we might be of stamps or coins or football programs. Nor do we all necessarily seek to gather all the bones to complete a king. Some go just for shins or skulls, or phalanges. But from the moment I joined the secret network, I was intent on collecting each and every bone of King Jasper I could lay my hands on. Why. Why, indeed, as I said, it's not even clear that King Jasper was a genuine King. Doubts were first raised shortly after his death, before even worms and rot had reduced him to naught but bones. His head, it was said, was not a kingly head. It was large and lopsided, and had the power of curd his gait was not a kingly gait, for he moved in an ungainly lollipop. His crown was unbid jeweled, and on close examination, made from pewter and tin.

Frank Key  13:41
He sat on easy on the throne, a furtive look in his milky half blind eyes, as if we had no right to there to sit. questions were raised and bruited abroad. The King Jasper were truly a king. Why was the lady of the castle and the shutter lane and not a queen? And was it true as Sam said that the castle janitor had a large and lopsided head with the palate of curd that his gate was an ungainly lollipop. And that instead of wearing a janitorial tatty cap atop his bonds, he sported an odd pointy hat by the pewter and Tim. I knew of all these doubts and questions. I was, after all the author of that fat and breathtaking biography of King Jasper, albeit unpublished, and according to certain sour faced kingley chroniclers unpublishable, I keep the manuscript in the same box in which I keep the bones in my allotment shade. The pages I scribbled upon either untold years, or suffused with the crown or Pong of the king. Lightly it has occurred to me that I might use them to make a Pappy and mash a model of King Jasper molded around his reassembled bones. But first I have to complete my collection. There is a knuckle to be tracked down and zoomed, buried in some faraway field dropped a century ago by a Baron or a barbarian from a bag of looted peasant and Google's I must listen to the gossip on the grapevine of the secret network alert for hints and clues. Then one night, I shall set out with my spade, King or janitor, it makes no difference to me. I've already made his throne from the couplings of a dozen discarded chairs. It's covered with a shroud in the corner of my shed. And when the missing knuckle is at last dug up on all the bones put together and encased in my mashed up manuscript molded into kingly shaping Pappy amaxra I will have a mannequin to plop onto the throne. I will haul it out of the shed and onto my cart, and trundle it along the country lines for mile after mile, reconstructing the legendary journey made by King Jasper as he traversed his kingdom. He said that he stopped off at many villages along the way to do a spot of repair work or mopping just like a janitor. But he never lost sight half blind as he was of his eventual destination, the electrified castle perched on a bleak promontory overlooking a bleaker sea, we're in awaited the shadow lane, who had stolen his heart, heart, spleen, liver and light all along rotted away. But I have his bones. But one

I'm going to briefly interrupt the flow of the program to do my occasional thing of suggesting that you make sure you go and read the hooting yard website at hooting yard, one word.org because there's a lot of material on the website that isn't on the radio show, pictures and bits and bobs and all sorts of things. And while you're there my occasional appeal for you to send a donation. This show is brought to you free of charge and I don't get paid for it. So if you'd like to send me some money for the thousands of words I have poured out over the last. God knows how long that will be most welcome, actually is I've just reminded that this show. Today's show is as close as we will get to the eighth anniversary of hooting yard on the air, which was first broadcast on resonance on the 14th of April 2004. Eight long years ago on Saturday, and so continuously for eight years, with a few little breaks here and there when as a studio moved, or I became ill and unable to drag my weary bones into the studio. Other than that, the show has been on air now for eight years. So that's something to celebrate. And what better way to celebrate than to send Mr. Key some money. Anyway. this coming Saturday is the eighth anniversary. And last Sunday was Easter Sunday. And Easter Sunday is the most important day in the Christian calendar. The day when we celebrate the ineffable mystery of the resurrection. In this godless age, some of you may have no idea what I'm talking about. I refer you to the 1974 hit single by Mott the Hoople roll away the stone, which in turn, refers to the scene in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 28, verses one to six. In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary to see the sepal Cup. And behold, there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his Raymond white as snow. And for fear of him, the keepers did shake and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, fear not Ye, for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified, he is not here, for He is risen, as he said, Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And also the Gospel of Mark chapter 16, verses one to four. And when the Sabbath was passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came onto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. And they said among themselves, who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sapulpa. And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away, for it was very great. The evangelists, Luke and john cover the same material, but you get the idea, I hope. For many years now, my own way of celebrating Easter has been to bays in the blood of the Lamb. During the rest of the year, excuse me. During the rest of the year, I bathe as normal in hot water, perhaps with an admixture of bubble bath. But on Easter Sunday, I like to make a special effort in honor of he who is risen. From time to time, I've been asked to provide a set of instructions so that others may do as I do. This is not surprising, as I know many of you seek to live your lives as closely as possible, according to the tenets

Frank Key  22:12
of hooting yard. To date I've kept my Easter light under an Easter bushel, but recently I found my arms twisted as if I were Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo in the Maltese Falcon, until I agree to explain exactly what you need to do. First of all, load up your cart with empty buckets and an axe, the blade of which should have been sharpened leisurely on your wet stone, get dressed in a big black cape, or alternately in a winding sheet, the better to suggest an angel of death, and set your features and an awful Rictus of terror then set out for a nearby fields where sheep and their lands are likely to be gambling. If you have a yapping dog that could be useful in rounding up lands and running in circles around them, so they're too frightened to escape. Take it with you. It can either ride on the cart along with the buckets and the X. Or if it's a particularly frisky yapping dog, let it trot beside you. When you reach the field, take your axe and run screaming I saw the lamb smite it. a cursory knowledge of lamb anatomy can come in useful at this point for you should if possible, try to sever an artery with the first smiting. Then, pick up the lamb by a hind leg, hold it over one of the buckets and squeeze as much of its blood out of it as you can. When you're done. Toss the drained corpse of the lamb to one side, run screaming at another lamb and repeat the process. You should continue until all your buckets are brim full of lands blood. If you are a namby pamby do gooder who blogs at the first sight of say, a baby Sparrow with a broken wing or a weak ping Doh i'd often you might want to hire a rough Ian from the local tavern to do the slaughtering and blood draining for you. I cannot say I recommend this method. However, as Tavern ruffians are not the most trustworthy of men, and you'll have no guarantee that the bucket he delivers to your door are filled with the blood of lambs. Give a roughly and an X and they'll probably just go and slaughter the first thing he sees, which might include your yapping dog, a defense Through this widow woman, a puppy or indeed you when your buckets are full transyl occur at home and clean the blade of your axe with small finger and borax. You can then take the buckets up to the bathroom, remembering first to put the plug in the bath. Tip the blood from each bucket into the tub. Take off your cable, winding sheet and whatever else you're wearing, and climb into the bath. lie back, relax and hammer him. I usually go for the old rugged cross. If you do not know any hymns that Mott the Hoople hit is as good as substituted any. It may be that you live in an area bereft of lands, perhaps in some sea girt hellhole where turtles arrive, I have not been able to ascertain any specific krisztian connotations relating to the blood of turtles. But the ancient Romans used it for both shampoo and toothpaste and mixed with human milk as a cure for earache. The ancient Romans, of course, were pagans and lived in benighted ignorance of Christ. So do bear that in mind as you or you're hired Ruffin stalk down to the beach bent on slaughter.

I should point out in that last piece, I'm not sure I have my Peter Lorre reference right. There's definitely a film in which he please stop twisting my arm. But I'm not sure it's the Maltese Falcon, they might be Casablanca or it might be something else entirely. If you know, please get in touch, hooting yard hooting dot yard@gmail.com. And tell me because I've been racking my brains as have certain of my other readers. And we can't seem to recall which film Peter Lorre says, Stop twisting my arm. But he does, I'm sure of it. Congress beer, vivid dream. And that's all we have time for on hooting yard on the air this week, the eighth anniversary show. Why not send me eight pounds or 80 pounds or 800 pounds to celebrate? That would make give you give you a little glow of righteousness in your heart. And bless your cotton socks if you do so. So that's it for this week. I'll be back next week. Next week we might mark the anniversary another anniversary coming up which is the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic on Sunday morning. hooting yard isn't in the middle of the night on Sunday, but maybe we'll celebrate that anniversary next week. I am now babbling without really knowing what I'm saying. So the best thing for me to do is to shut up and for john to launch into the Caucasian lullaby theme music and I will go away
