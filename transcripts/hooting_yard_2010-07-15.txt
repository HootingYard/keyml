In the medieval imagination, this was a region of uttermost dread, where the heavens fling down liquid sheet to flame and the waters boil. Where serpent rocks and Olga islands lie in wait for the mariner weather dry hand of Satan reaches up from the fathomless depths to seize Him, where he will turn black in face and body as a mark of God's vengeance, for the insolence of his prying into this forbidden mystery. And even if he should be able to survive all these ghastly perils, and sail on through, he would then arrive in the sea of obscurity, and be lost forever in the Vipers and slime at the edge of the world. And with that, careful thought Welcome to this week's hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And that was a quotation from a book called The river Congo, the discovery, exploration and exploitation of the world's most dramatic river, by Peter for bath, which is a good name, I think. And now, last week, I read a piece, if you recall, called poultry yards of the Grand dark groups. And following the broadcast, I got a letter from longtime listener, Dr. Ruth pastry. I haven't heard from her for a long time. But she wrote in response to this and I'm gonna read her letter. Dear Mr. Key. Last week, I listened to poultry yards of the Grand dark drugs. And though I was not impressed, I couldn't help but be intrigued by your reference to a breakfast recipe, which involves, and I quote, more eggs than you can shake a stick at how many eggs is that? I wondered. The only indication you gave and I quote again is a goodly number of eggs. This is less than helpful. a goodly number in it in and of itself is not a measurable quantity. A writer with more concern for his or her audience would be precise in these matters, and tell us plainly how many eggs we would have to assemble before we were no longer able to shake a stick at them. Because of your laxity, I was put in the position of having to find out for myself, I went for a walk in the woods and came back carrying a stout and sturdy stick. I think it was a branch from a hornbeam. It was a very shakable stick, as I ascertained by shaking it experimentally a few times while stood in the woods, squirrels scattered as I shook it, and there was movement in shrubbery, as if a small woodland creature had been startled. Had I had with me my net, I would have used it to entrap the creature, whatever it was, and then rain blows upon it with the stick until we're dead and taken it home with me to boil for a snack, garnished paps with a tomato and basil. As it was, I was netlist so I returned home with just the stick. I then said to preparing my test area you know I think how thorough I am. I shoved the kitchen table back against the kitchen wall thus creating sufficient space for me to be able to shake the stick without risking damage to my many and various kitchen appurtenances. Next, I opened my refrigerator and removed from it every single egg currently in my possession, placing them in their carton on my countertop. I was somewhat dismayed to note that I had only five eggs from the cartons original complement of six. My instinctive thought was that five was unlikely to be the goodly number of eggs you prescribed. However, instinct is one thing and then pericle evidence is another thing entirely. It was clear to me that the absolute minimum possible indicated by a goodly number of eggs was a simple floral our plot was a simple plurality, in other words, to eggs.

Before continuing, I fetch from a cubby a fresh ledger dozens of pages of creamy paper divided by faint blue lines into squares. In this I would tabulate my results using several different colored pencils, which I duly sharpened with a pencil sharpener. I then removed two eggs from the carton and placed them on the table, taking care to position them in such way that they would not roll off the tabletop and smashed a squelchy ruin upon the floor near linoleum. I had already made certain the tabletop was the level using a Vanda huddle level ometer a splendid device, which I find far more effective than the common spirit level, and which uses no spirits whatsoever. With the two eggs in place upon the table, as they would be were I to be embarking upon my breakfast preparation. I shook the stick at them. I suffered no hindrance, and could have gone on shaking the stick for hours upon end had I been so minded, but I shook the stick only for so long to become convinced beyond any shade of doubt that to was not the goodly number of eggs defined as more eggs than I could shake a stick at. I noted the results in the ledger, painstakingly and then removed a third egg from the carton and placed it next to the original brace of eggs on the table proceeding to shake the steak once again. You will I suppose, have worked out that soon enough, I tried four then five eggs with identical outcomes. Pleased as I was with the severe beauty of the tabulation of results in my ledger, I have now exhausted my supply of eggs. For a madcap moment, I considered propping a mirror upon the kitchen table, thus doubling the visible number of eggs thinking by doing so I could somehow trick the stick to immediate objections to such tomfoolery rapidly presented themselves. First, the positioning of the mirror would be enormously complicated if I were to be able to present the appearance of the intermediate egg numbers from six through nine. Second, the stick was just a stick from a hornbeam probably, and did not in itself have sense perception, visual or otherwise, the impossibility of shaking a stick at a goodly number of eggs. whatever that number might be, was, I felt sure dependent not upon the stick itself, but on the quantity of eggs one was attempting to shake it at. And in turn, that surely meant they had to be real eggs, not mirror images, nor any other eggs of illusion. Now I was reluctant to march off to my nearest egg shop to buy the extra eggs I would need. For one thing, I had no idea how many eggs that might be. Also, what was I going to do with them all. When my experiment was done, one can only eat so many eggs before becoming disgusted at the prospect of yet another egg based meal, and it would be a terrible sin and a waste of money to let them rot on eaten. I thought it unlikely that the proprietor of the egg shop would be willing to allow me to return any bought but unused eggs, for he is not the most amiable of shopkeepers. Indeed, more than once I have had blazing arguments with him, are not always on the subject of eggs. Then I recalled that there had been recent tidings from the farmyard of Mad old farmer frac. It was said that he was no longer devoting himself exclusively to his bellowing cows, but had installed a hen coop with hens in it on the farm. Where there's hens, there's eggs, I said to myself, not wholly grammatically, but memorably. I wonder if it was an old country saying, I resolved to ask old farmer frac if this was so. Although the main business of the visit to him I now embarked upon without delay, was to borrow from him as many eggs as possible. Hail to the old farmer frack I cried within the hour, leaning against his fence. I was wondering if it would be possible for me to borrow from you as many eggs as possible. I will bring them back before nightfall. The Mad old farmer was standing in the middle of one of his fields, looking mad and finally doing something with a spade. When he heard me he looked up, let for the spade and came bounding over to me at inhuman speed. His eyes were bloodshot, and His hair was a tangle of filth.

My eggs are not for borrowing, he said, under any circumstances. But for an old friend like you Dr. pastry, I might consider renting them out. And so we haggled. We had done so many times before over the years. The thing is, I have advanced haggling skills. Whereas mad old farmer frac is hopeless and inept in this area, as in so many others. Within a few minutes, I had him agreeing to let me take away hundreds upon hundreds of eggs in return for a photocopy of my bus pass, and a sprig of Myrtle, of course, I then had to scoot off to town to get the photocopy and pop into Myrtle sprigs r us to get the sprig, but that was soon accomplished. When I returned to the farm model farm a frack was nowhere to be seen. I thought he might be hurting his bellowing cows from field to field pointlessly and went to roaming to see if I could spot him. And then I found the cows, all of them without their father standing around in a distant field beyond a drainage ditch in the rain. I trudged back through muck and puddles to the hen coop and poked my head in for a look. see lots and lots of hens, but no farmer and more to the point no eggs. A couple of the more savage hens made moves to attack me, but I remonstrated with them in a sort of screechy. Hence prachar I picked up for my hen person I met on my travels long ago, and they were immediately pacified and not just pacified, but put into comas from which they will only awake when next It is time for them to lay an egg. That done I wandered aimlessly around the farm for a few hours before giving up and going home cursing mad old farmer frakkin throwing pebbles at crows in my annoyance. I unlatch the door of pastry cottage and they're in my kitchen was the Mad old farmer himself waving a stick at the kitchen table upon which teetered a gigantic pile of eggs. He looked around as I came in. Ah, there you are, doctor, he said in his mad voice. I was so interested in what you were telling me about your egg experiment during our haggling process. I thought I'd carry on where you left off while you were affecting the agreed rental. Speaking of which, do you have the photocopy of your bus pass on the sprig of Myrtle nonplussed I handed over the items without a word. So far, I'm up to 162 eggs set old farmer frack and still nothing is impeding me from shaking the stick at them. Have you been tabulating the results in the ledger? I asked. Not unreasonably. Oh, I forgot to do that bit, he said. At least he had the grace to look shamefaced. Then we must begin again from six upwards, I said otherwise the experiment will not have been conducted with sufficient rigor. Yes, yes, of course, said the Mad old farmer. And I was delighted to see that he immediately began to remove 156 eggs from the table one by one with surprisingly dainty movements, placing them hither and siddur about the kitchen wherever he was able to find space among the many and various kitchen appurtenances I mentioned earlier, only a few of which he had broken or dented when clumping about before suddenly remembering his daintiness upon my arrival home. I have to say that tackling this as a two person job has been a marked improvement. I can concentrate on the majestic sweeping penmanship of my ledger entries. While mad old farmer frac shakes the stick. As a farmer, he is able to shake a stick with a much more conviction that I can muster. For Of course, he shakes a stick at something most days, whereas I only rarely do so. We are taking it in turns to move the eggs from their temporary storage places, one at a time to join the eggs accumulated upon the table. I am beginning to worry if the legs of my kitchen table will continue to support the ever increasing weight of eggs. And as I write have sent mad old farmer frac off perfect length of titanium cut to size from Oldsmar. purgatives cut to size two titanium reinforcement rods shop. I scribbled a note fin to take explaining to Omar purgative. The table is currently supporting 640 eggs and asking that she supplied two titanium rods sturdy enough to support twice that number. I added Of course, the relevant measurements of both my table legs and the approximate weight of eggs.

Frank Key  14:27
fairly soon however, we're going to run out of eggs between us. I'm sure we will work out how to get more by hire or theft or as a last resort cash purchase. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to wonder just how many eggs we will have piled on my reinforced table before I pause colored pencil held steady over my ledger. And the time comes when mad old farmer frac raises the hornbeams stick to shake it again and finds Oh sweet mystery of life or rather, of egg numbers. He's completely unable to do so. When that time comes Mr. Key, I will write to you again requesting further details of your eggy breakfast recipe, which I have no doubt is both succulent and toothsome yours waiting for Matt old farmer frac to come crashing through the door.

I don't know what that was all about. But anyway, this is far more straightforward. Over the years, there's been a great deal of discussion about the exact identity of the so called fifth Beatle, as has been regarding which pinnipeds deserves the title. The seventh seal. Much less attention, however, has been paid to the eighth dwarf in that old yarn about Snow White. Most people are now aware I think that following a rebranding exercise, the original Seven Dwarves were renamed wretched, spiteful incontinent, wistful, lippy, rancorous and preening. But who, oh, who was the eighth dwarf, of whose presence one is made disturbingly aware in the interstices of the story, glimpse, as it were with peripheral vision, if at all. This is the dwarf we recall, if we recall him chewing on Brazil nuts, moaning stuffing the pocket of his tunic with genetically modified seed, stinking of vinegar, and hot to trot daddio he threatens always to undermine the trajectory of the story, almost as if he was some kind of post modernist dwarf heaven for bid. It is for this reason that certain intellectuals have tried long winded Lee to claim that his name is Roland Barth or Julia kristeva. But this will not do it will not do it at all. I'm not going to bother explaining why it will not do because to do so would only lend credence to these harebrained swathes of inanity. If we're to remain sound of mind and with our feet planted firmly upon the ground of reason, then we must withhold credence from these blather mouths, must we not? So successfully does the ACE dwarf hide in the margins of the tale that many readers and viewers of the film adaptation do not notice him at all? No doubt. That's why there's been so much less agonizing over him though, over the fifth Beatle and the seventh seal to give an example, probably unnecessarily, but I'll give it anyway because that's the kind of crap I am today. In any case, a while ago, I was at a function. It's not important what the nature of the function was, and I approached A gent who was sporting the kind of decisive cravat I admire. And after introducing myself, I asked him point blank if he had any pet theory regarding the identity of the ice dwarf, his eyes boggled and he muttered something I couldn't quite hear. And then he turned away, pointedly, pointedly a graceless get to be sure. But later I learned he was discomforted by my query. Because, and this is the knob. He had no idea what I was talking about. One of the fundamental objections to the idea that the ice dwarf might be called Roland bath or Julia kristeva is of course that both these doublings comprise a first or given name, what in more civilized times was called a krisztian name and a surname, whereas dwarves at least the seven fellows in the story, have only a single word for their name, and that be noted a descriptive one. This holds true both before and after the rebranding exercise. It's unlikely that we're going to learn the identity of the ice dwarf anytime soon. But several lines of inquiry are being followed up by different scholars. Some of these Well, I'm sure proved to be dead ends, blind alleys, but others might just might bear fruit. Nixon, for example, not the ex president. By the ways I trust that it's obvious. It's in the jungles of Borneo, hacking at foliage with a machete and swatting flies with a flyswatter trying to track down something small and wearing gloves last reported seen in 1974. It may not be a dwarf at all, of course. Meanwhile, elsewhere, popping to this, combing through every single volume on the shelves of the library of diminutive beings in FUBAR Ynez hoping to light upon something factual, definitive and unswerving. There are only six books in the library, so it shouldn't take him too long. I will of course keep you fully informed of developments. Well, I say of course, but I might forget all about it for a few years. I can be like that sometimes forgetful of both important and unimportant things have important dwarves and unimportant. What cell towers, raisins, prunes

many moons ago, back in February 2004. In fact, that's even before the hosting yard on the air started, which was two months later. So it must have been on the website on the hooting odd website. Don't forget to go there that hooting yard.org anyway, on the website, six and a half or almost six and a half years ago, I provided a couple of examples of the kind of invective to deploy when writing an unfavorable book review. The book in question was Ulysses by James Joyce, although he invented Joyce himself and variably pronounced it ooh lysis By the way, and anyway, that in these these are two contemporary reviews of Ulysses or ulisses, the teachers world said, an immense mass of clotted nonsense, and the sphere said the maddest, muddiest most loathsome book issued in our own or any other time. In artistic, incoherent, unquote ugly, nasty, a book that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum. That's how and I don't write them like that anymore. Anyway, I can now recommend a couple more such terrains. Though in this case the book is less well known. Ada Isaacs Mencken, 1835 to 1868 was an actress, painter, poet, possible bigger missed and bareback circus equestrian, and in the last year of her life, she published a volume of poetry entitled, in fair lycia in order to drum up sales, the rumor was spread, perhaps by Mencken herself, that some or all of the poems were, in fact written by her Pau algernon Charles Swinburne. However, all of them had previously appeared in various American magazines before she even met Swinburne. In fallacy his lack of success may have been Drew, at least in part, to reviews such as these and the Athenian said, a wilderness of rubbish and affected agonies of yearnings after the unspeakable which retrieves the nonsensical and the Saturday review said, A beleaguered panorama of deaths and size and blood and tears and fire and general gloom and watery ghastliness.

Finally, this week, I'm going to leave you with the first item in our important new series, breakfasts of kings, in which we cast a be the eye on the breakfast preferences of various monarchs throughout history. King Leopold, the second of Belgium, eight six poached eggs, an enormous number of slices of toast and an entire jar of marmalade for his breakfast every day. King Leopold spoke French rather than Flemish. So he didn't refer to his breakfast as head onto bite, which is what I call my breakfast. And one other note it concerns not just breakfast, but every daily meal. And it's not a king writing. But this quotation from the journals of Roger casement is worth noting. Chicken Chicken custard custard every day, john lamb at the time 1903 Roger casements meals were being prepared for him by a cook known only as Harry bill. And with that thought, custard custard Chicken Chicken every day, god damn. That's the end of this week, hooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it learned many things and furrowed your brow and serious contemplation. And you can do so to get at the same time next week on resonance 104 point four FM bye bye
