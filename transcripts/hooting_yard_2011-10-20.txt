Good evening This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. And that's entirely true. You know, we do all do all this for no money whatsoever, absolutely free. So when you finished donating to resonance, you can also donate individually to hooting yard, which would be an extremely good idea. I'm afraid I don't accept either tea bags or hobnobs, but I do accept hard cash. So send some to me. This show is dedicated for reasons I won't go into two dimity, Eric and Brian. And I'd like to say that it was sponsored by Christopher Plummer. But sadly it's not. It's 630 ish. You might be sitting down to your dinner. Had you been sitting down to dinner with Prince Henry at the merchant Taylor's company in 1607. This six year in the summer of 1607. This is what would have been on the menu. swans, godwit, shovelers partridges, owls, cuckoos, ring doves, pullets, ducklings, teal, peacocks, rabbits leverette, and a great turkey along with 1300 eggs, three great lobsters and 200 prawns, salmon, salt fish place, so Dori carp and tengiz subtle ends and ribs of beef, mutton and lands dows it needs tongues and sweetbreads and to conclude the evening, figs, dates, prunes, current almonds, strawberries, gooseberries, cherries, pears, apples, damsons, oranges, and quinces. 28 barrels of beer were provided to slake the diners thirst, together with more than 440 gallons of wine. And that menu is given to us in a new biography of Ben Johnson by Ian Donaldson. Compare and contrast with this dish or set of dishes the dinner the dinner began with a soup of ASPs in simmering oil. On each side was a dish of vegetables, one containing thistles and bird ox and the other fuming acid. Other side dishes of turtles, rats, bats and molds were garnished with live coals. For the fish course, he ate a dish of snakes in boiling, tar and pitch. His roast was a screech owl in a source of glowing brimstone. The salad proved to be a spiderwebs full of small explosive squids, a plate of butterfly wings and Manor worms, a dish of toads surrounded with flies, crickets, grasshoppers, church beetles, spiders, and caterpillars. He washed always down with flaming brandy. And for dessert eight the four large candles standing on the table. Both of the hanging side lamps were their contents. And finally, the large center lamp oil wick and all this leaving the room in darkness, do force face Shawn out in a mask of living flames. And that dinner is from a book by Harry Houdini, published in 1921. entitled, miracle mongers and their methods are complete expose a of the modus operandi of fire eaters, he resistors poison eaters, venomous reptile defiers sold swallowers human ostriches, strong men, etc.

Excuse me. I very much doubt that my life would improve if I moved to North Korea. But But how fantastic would it be to be a member of the art squad of the Pyongyang Polk Cree guidance Bureau. I'm indebted to the blog by MC Hartley, where I learned about this fantastic organization. Anyway. So I learned about and decided I was gonna go and live in North Korea, just so I could be a member. But I had second thoughts, and what would one thing and another I've decided I really don't want to go and live in North Korea. But instead, I'm going to set up my own art squad and offer its services to my local poultry guidance Bureau. The first problem is that I'm not sure there actually is a poultry guidance Bureau in my bailiwick. Certainly, I've been unable to find any evidence of one. The second problem related to the first is that I don't quite know what a poultry guidance Bureau is, or does poultry and bureau a clear enough, but the guidance bit has me baffled. Are we talking about some sort of counseling service for distraught chickens? Or is the guidance more literal involving directional pointing devices showing hens the way from their coop to, I don't know to wherever else in the farmyard, they have urgent hen business to attend to. Anyway, can hens read simple directional pointing devices? It might be that the bureau despite its name isn't for the guidance of poultry at all. But for the guidance of humans in their interactions with poultry. I can understand that that might be a useful service. After all, if you presented me with several chickens, squawking and pecking, I doubt very much if I'd have the faintest idea what to do with them, at least on an immediate basis. I suspect I might panic if I found a piece of chickens or a bevy of quail abandoned on my doorstep by a feckless farmer. I can well imagine how reassuring it would be in such a circumstance to have a hotline to the poultry gardens Bureau. Even if my initial surmise was correct, and the Bureau was a counseling service for poultry. I presume they would send an outreach worker to placate the poor, abandoned chickens and quail, which re rampaging around my living room making an unholy mess. Well, I could hardly just leave them on the doorstep could I? Obviously, I'm going to have to ascertain the precise nature of the poultry guidance Bureau's business before I can make a proper Fist of the art squad. It might be for example, that our art will consist simply of beautifully painted directional pointing devices designed to appeal to the optic nerves of poultry, in which case, I'll just need to gather about me a bunch of sign painters. On the other hand, we may need a team of actors to facilitate role playing exercises for traumatized hens as part of the counseling service. Or if the Bureau is indeed mainly for human benefit, then an own power band playing string stirring rhythms sorry. Or, if the Bureau is indeed mainly for human benefit, then an on power band playing stirring anthems might be more appropriate. Although having just said that, I can't think why. All things considered, my best bet is to assemble a crack squad of sign painters actors and empower band musicians, together with a few practitioners of other arts just to be on the safe side. We can then devise and rehearse an arts squad practice to present as a fait accompli to the nearest poultry guidance Bureau. When that is we managed to track it down in its lair.

Excuse me clearly the formation of an art squad for a poultry gardeners Bureau. was captured the imagination of at least one other person. I had a letter from after publishing that on the hooting yard website. This very morning, I had a letter from Mr. Nick Willesden. Nick wrote, Dear Mr. Key, I have been both spurred and intrigued by your noble cause, and hereby offer my services to whatever ends you deem necessary for the formation of a fully fledged art squad to act in conjunction with the as yet an identified regional equivalent of a poultry guidance Bureau. Further to this, should the Pyongyang poultry guidance Bureau and its counterparts on our own shores, see fit to fund such a research trip? I'm happy to travel in your stead to North Korea and report back in fall. I can only assume that there must be some such enigmatic institution in place to direct and counsel our feathered friends. But I suspect in the current political climate, any affiliated art squad will doubtless have suffered funding cuts and as such be in dire need of support from volunteer artists such as myself. The thought that we could be responsible for raising a generation of unruly and artistically unenlightened poultry. No doubt capable of unthinkable thuggery distresses me no end, and I will do everything within my power to prevent it. I am of course, happy to send through an accompanying curriculum vitai preferably once the true nature of such a squad has been confirmed, so that I might best highlight my relevant skills to your recruitment Team cordiali Mr. Nick Wilson.

Frank Key  12:09
So I think many more of you should take inspiration from from that volunteer and volunteer own services for the art squad. And I promise to let you know when either myself or Nick Wilson has worked out precisely what it is that the poultry count, poultry bureau does. poultry guidance bureau I had some guns and I had some butter. early in life, one learns to put guns before butter, even though if one were to follow the alphabet strictly, one would put butter before guns. But I've learned my lessons as well. So whenever I buy a new dictionary, and I often do, I turn immediately to the section of words beginning with G. Find the entry for guns, sniff it out with a sharp pair of scissors, then leap back through the dictionary to the section of words beginning with B. Locate the entry for butter, then paste in the snipped out section just above it with Mukul edge. Of course, what all this means is that I have a hole in my dictionary and a gap on the reverse of the page where guns appeared. And also, I have obscured the text just above the entry for butter by pasting my snippet over it with mucilage but this is a small price to pay for following the edict drummed into me by my parents and my school teachers and my military chaplains one which I have never called into question, though at times I have been tempted to do so. Yes, sad to say there was a time when I was beset by anxiety dreams, in which I was poised with a sharp pair of scissors to cut out guns and its definition for a brand new dictionary, the pot of new college and a spatula beside the dictionary on the desk, and my hand trembled and I could not make the snip. I had this dream or nightmare over and over again for a number of years. In a more alarming variant. I dreamed that I managed to cut out the guns entry, but then mislaid it or dropped it into a wastepaper bin, or it was consumed by flames. And I had but a pile of ash, which I then painstakingly tried to paste atom by atom into the dictionary with new college, and I would wake up shrieking oddly, it never occurred to me to see Look at the definition for butter and paste it with mucilage. Immediately after guns in the dictionary had I ever done so the net result would have been the same, I would still have had a hole and a gap and an obscure definition, but one for a word beginning with G rather than with B. I've always made it a habit to be in possession of both guns and butter, but to be very clear about which takes priority when laying my breakfast table of a morning. For example, now I can no longer afford a valet and have to fend for myself. I always place a pair of pistols on the table cost first and the butter dish Second. All other necessaries toast rack, plate, bowl, nut, cracker, and so on, can be laid out in any old order I choose as haphazard as you like. But I have learned through experience that if I put the butter dish on the breakfast table before the guns, I suffer from terrible indigestion thereafter. Such is the power of the mind. Clearly, there is no physiological reason while we'll be stricken with gastric horas. In such circumstances for breakfast is the same every morning with minor variants. Special K buttered toast, a handful of filberts and a pot of tea of the four central items to which I might add some eggs or porridge or eggy porridge, but rarely, rarely. I will usually handle the firearms while carrying my toast checking their well oiled and primed the chambers fully loaded with bullets and the safety categories on

Frank Key  16:49
when I had a valet, I like to amuse myself by taking potshots at him, first with one pistol and then with the other while chewing my toast. He was alive valet as valets go, and he always managed to leap and volton jump and shimmy out of the paths of the bullet until last Thursday morning when he did not. Another instance of my putting guns before butter is when packing my things for a camping and hiking trip. First I pack my guns then following goons system in order my axiom cover axle grease, bacon barometer, pocket bean pot, beans in bagged beef, dried beeswax Bible, blacking and brush blanket boxes. bread for lunch brokens oiled broom, canned goods, chalk, cheese, cloth brush, cold line, coffee and pot comb campus, condensed milk cups, carry comb date, dippers, dishes, dish towels, drawers, dried fruits, Dutch oven envelopes, figs firkin, fishing tackle flour prepared frying pan guidebook, half barrel halter hammer, hard bread harness, examine hatchet have a sack ink, portable bottle knives, sheath table pocket and butcher lemons lineament lunch for a day or two maps matches and safe marline meal in bag meal bag, medicines milk can molasses money change monkey wrench moskito bar mustard and pot nails neatsfoot oil night shirt oatmeal oil can opera glass overcoat padlock and key pails, Paper Paper collars pens, pepper, pickles pins portfolio postage stamps, postal cards, rope rubber blanket rubber coat rubber boots sale needle salt salt fish salt pork self saw shingles for plates shirts, shoes and strings slippers, soap songbook spade spoons stove utensils in bags, sugar tea tent tent poles tent pins toothbrush towels twine vinegar watch and key and then at the very last the butter dish and cover with the butter in it an unfortunate consequence of this system and one which still occasionally has me tempted to wonder if my parents and my school teachers and my military chaplains were indeed correct in their insistence on guns before butter is that if one we need one's guns as a matter of urgency, there is a great deal of unpacking and rummaging and faffing In order to get at them I remember that once for example, I set out on a hike, and I've got no further than a few yards beyond my garden gate, when I saw looming ahead of me, a sluice of ferocious bears frantically I unpacked and rummaged and fast, but by the time I lay hold of my guns, I had had one of my arms torn off, and a bloody lip. Luckily, one shot of my pistol into the air, and the Ferocious bears became cowardly and scattered. When I told this tale to a military chaplain in the clinic where they fitted my prosthetic arm, he explained to me that I ought to have used the easily accessible because last packed butter to smear a greasy patch between myself and the bears, upon which they would have slipped and toppled over, giving me plenty of time to unpack and rummage and fat for the guns. But then, I protested. I would have no butter for my toast during the hike. Padre. You are clearly unfamiliar, my child, he said, with that piece of countryside wisdom, which goes in river stream and real catch the perch and pike. But never batter your toast when you're going on a hike. I hadn't heard that. But it made a lot of sense. I did wonder where a military chaplain and picked up rustic law. But He further explained to me that before taking religious orders, he had for many years been a

Frank Key  21:48
peasant, and still, from time to time, had bits of straw stuck in his hair. I felt very fortunate indeed, to have him as my spiritual advisor. My light valet, bless his cotton socks, had also tried to dispense pearls of wisdom, and he too, had been a peasant before going to valet school. But one thing that always struck me was that he had no view at all on the primacy of guns over butter. I would, for example, summon him to fetch my snippy scissors and pot of new college and spatula whenever I bought a new dictionary, which I often did. Rather than simply doing as he was bitten, like an ideal valet, he would sigh and shuffle from foot to foot, even go, even going so far as to suggest that I might for once leave my dictionary unmodified with butter before guns alphabetically, and employ my time instead, with a less exacting activity, such as playing the harmonica or doing conjuring tricks. I had to lay hold of one of my pistols in easy reach on the table, just in front of the butter and pointed at his head and he scarpered in search of the scissors, and you college and spatula. I suspect it would not have been so attentive, had I picked up and pointed at him a knob of butter, which just goes to show how right my parents, my school teachers, and my military chaplains were all along.

Listeners who've been paying attention will know that, that list of camping equipment I read out last week as well, but then I inserted it cleverly into a thrilling tale or an anecdote. But anyway, useful as the list of camping equipment is it raises a number of questions. And the following puzzle is spring to mind though I haven't yet been able to come up with answers. Which version of the Bible is best suited for a camping trip? How many boxes should one pack and have What kind? Which is the most effective oil to apply to one's brokens? Why is the harness the sole item on the list? Which one should examine presumably before the start of the camping trip? Are we to assume that all the other things can be shoved willy nilly into one camping Pan technicon without them being given the ones over with a gym lid? I mean, meal in bag meal bag. You recall that's one of the part of the list. Does this mean that the proper prepared camper should take two meal bags, one containing meal and one empty, or is the repetition designed to hammer the point home for camping Dunder pate, much as one hammers home the pegs of the Dunder paint tent. Regarding pens should want a ballpoint with tips about the same size as a lobsters brain, or thick black magic markers, or fountain pens, or indeed swans. No particular songbook is recommended and it will be helpful to have some idea of the kind of songs one might be expected to sing while hunched around the fire at Camp hooting yard. And I asked for suggestions with these and any and other camping related questions thrown up by the list. And once again, one of my correspondents gave us some very useful information banished to a pompous land, who was banished from this land and now lives, I think in the United States, said regarding song books, my own personal preference would be for the 129 songs of Charles Ives. The late songs of Cornelius Cardew, and sheet music for banished Jr's current favorite. Everybody's happy nowadays, by the Buzzcocks.

Man that my tinies is the end of this week shooting out on the air. I do hope you've enjoyed it. Yes, we'll be back next week. Meanwhile, don't forget to go to the website, buy some books, or as previously suggested, just send me some money. You also might want to make sure that you put down in your diary, the eighth Friday the 18th of November. Coming up in about four weeks time when me and our Spaceman will be performing. The closest thing you can get to hooting yd live an evening of lagu breus music and lopsided prose at Wolfson and Taipei, bookshop cafe and gallery in Bermondsey square, sa one go to the Wolfson anti website or go to the hooting yard website for details of that gig I suppose it should be called where you will get an entire evening of me babbling and alpha Spaceman singing my songs are and his songs but some of the songs with words written by me. So I would definitely be there. I will be there as he will but you should be to do come along. And yes, I think I better shut up now. back next week. Bye bye.
