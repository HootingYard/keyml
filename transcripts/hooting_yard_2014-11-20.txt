Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting out on the air brought to your ears as ever by Johnny seven behind the knobs, and assisted this week by Dan, although I'm not sure what the system is Dan is rendering this he hasn't been anywhere near the board full of knobs. Anyway, we may we need to make sure that you remember that. It's not just me babbling into a microphone, but this program is brought to you through the technical expertise of others. Anyway, I'll burn on Mars, we'll get on with it. Few relationships are as close and as intense as that between a janitor and his mop. He may sense an attachment to his bunch of keys, and his pail and his dog. But he cherishes his mop more than anything. I've spent several years interviewing janitors and invariably they volunteer the information that they're mop is their most treasured possession. They will say what they will say this loudly and with vehemence, even when their dog is sitting at bb&t at their feet, gazing up at them in adoration. I'm sure there's a monograph to be written one day upon janitors and their dogs. But I shall leave that joy to another Scribbler. It's not that I'm averse to dogs. Well, I am. But it's not my aversion that dissuades me from writing about them. We're a janitor to spout effusive folly roll on the subject of his dog. During one of my interviews, I would note it down accordingly and include it in my finished piece. I don't provide verbatim transcripts, preferring instead to give the reader or listener an impressionistic or expressionistic or borderline hysterical portrayal of the janitor through gorgeous words. Not all of these words will have been spoken by the janitor nor by me, but they seem to hover in the ether in the janitors vicinity. That's what I try as best as I'm able to communicate. It remains a remarkable fact that the thousands of janitors I've interviewed over the years have expressed boundless love for their mops. often they're moved to tears or contrarily to gales of unbridled Glee, or sometimes both turn turn about. It's an emotionally wrenching experience for them to be interviewed and also for me as the interviewer broaching the topic of the mop, and not knowing whether I will need to provide a napkin for them to dab at their tear stained cheeks, or a similar napkin for myself to wipe off the flecks of spittle sprayed over me by janitors in the extremes of happiness. It occasionally happens that the dog is frisky will try to catch the napkin, either of the napkins, and its drawers, and scamper away with it as if it were a bone. They're mysterious creatures, dogs, and often quite stupid. The mop being inanimate is much more predictable, and much less bother. For reasons I have not yet been able to fathom, no publisher has expressed an interest in my book of janitorial interviews. It thus remains in manuscript handwritten, with a butcher's pencil in a series of exercise books, some blind, some unlined. For the past several months I've had these books stored in a cupboard on the ground floor of a large building in a central location, near a bank into the vaults of which I wish to transfer them for greater security when I can afford the fee to do so. In the meantime, the cupboard is kept locked and watched over by a janitor, one of the few I have not taken time to interview. He prowls the corridors, rattling his bunch of keys, deploying his beloved mop and followed everywhere by his dog. Insert AP Latin phrase to conclude this piece with a freight of significance.

The relationship between a janitor and his pile is a matter well worth our attention. Some Genesis we'll call that pile a bucket, but it's much of a muchness it may well be that for the pernickety, a pail and a bucket are not quite the same thing. But we are not pernickety. At least not today. Today, we are having one of our non pernickety days. Good heavens. We did not even time the boiling of our breakfast egg to the second as we do on our pernickety days, no. Today we plop the egg into the pan and set the burners roaring beneath it, and we wandered away, picked up the post from the doormat, kick the wind Scott kicked it again. God knows why. Chuck the post into the wastepaper basket. It was all flyers flyers. put the kettle on. extracted from our majestic Buffon, a small beetle, which had taken up residence peas on like, and placed it on the window sill. Open the window, adjusted the position of the vows of hollyhock cuttings, turning them towards the light. Though Lord knows there was a little enough light so early was the our password and password in other degree ways, before returning to the kitchen to set the burners and roaring beneath the pan without checking the time on our wristwatch, rather, judging a sufficiency of past for the egg in the pan to be to thumb when shelled. On a pernickety day, on the other hand, we would not leave our post by the cooker, but count the minutes of the second gazing from wristwatch to pan and back again. And as the second hand on the watch takht to its appointed spot, we will immediately lift the pan from the roaring burners, extinguish them with the egg from the seizing waters and transfer it to its egg cup, a souvenir egg cup from an ill starred seaside resort, sure, in the knowledge that it had been boiled for a very specific and particular length of time, as recommended in blockman, manual of egg boiling, Second Edition lilac series. Thus, the variation between our pernickety and our non pernickety days, a variation designed to crack us from the bonds of rat. What does that have to do with janitors and piles or if you prefer, janitors and buckets? little or nothing like the little nurse of the light as we tuck into our early morning boiled egg, like the nothingness at the core of our all too mortal soul?

Last week, I think I told you that this week, I would be telling you all about janitors. And that's exactly what I'm doing. Few subjects have received as little attention as the relationship between a janitor and his spirit guide. All janitors have one though many janitors do not acknowledge its existence, while others, both janitors and observers of janitors. confuse the spirit guide with the janitors dog. Of course, not all janitors have dogs, which rather proves the point and should serve to clarify the matter. We shall examine the janitor dog Nexus in a future essay. If Nexus is the word I'm looking for. The spirit guides of janitors are clad invariably in raincoat, though being as a theory as the guides themselves, the raincoats are not visible to the mundane I. This makes them no less effective as raincoat janitors spirit guides Do not get wet in rain storms were they so to do, in all likelihood they would dissolve and form a puddle of Ecto plasmic sludge a puddle which the janitor would be duty bound to mop up with his decidedly Ana theory or mop. A duty made all the more onerous because he would no longer have his spirit guide to guide the mopping. A sure recipe for janitorial catastrophe. Let me repeat that, were they the spirit guides, so to do become rain soaked. In all likelihood, they would dissolve and form a puddle of ectoplasmic sludge, a puddle which the janitor would be duty bound to mop up with his decidedly unnecessary or mop a duty made all the more onerous because he would no longer have his spirit guide to guide the mopping, assure recipe for janitorial catastrophe. There is more wisdom packed into that single sentence than anything else I have ever written. And that's why I read it to you twice. The voting of catastrophe is the most important contribution his spirit guide makes to any janitors day. But it's not the only one. In the course of my interviews with thousands of janitors. Those who were prepared to admit the existence of their spirit guides mentioned a huge variety of ways in which these spectral rain coated beings from realms on the scene give a helping hand to their allotted janitor. Many of the testimonies I heard was incomprehensible, if not exactly gibberish. My lack of comprehension was due to the fact that not being a janitor myself, and thus not in possession of a spirit guide of my own. My puny brain could not make any sense of what I was being told. An example will give you some idea of my difficulty. This is from interview transcript number eight for nine. me Can you tell me something of earth shattering excitement about your spirit guide and the way age you in the course of a typical janitorial day. Speak clearly into the microphone. janitor number eight for nine hectic donkeys and the clicking of panic buttons or picnic buttons with unalloyed gusto pop x pop vog event, squelchy invasions usually hand hinged. It is possible if one study that reply for several years with the aid of glossaries and reference books and an atlas of the other side that some sense could be run from it. But even in the absence of understanding, it demonstrates, I think that the ways of spirit guides are not our ways, and we can form only a partial, blurred and vague conception of those ways. is the same true of the janitors themselves. Do they have a clearer understanding of their spirit guide?

It's instructive in this connection to do as I have done and to observe a janitor in the throes of his janitor them all the while making notes in a notebook with a propelling pencil. When reviewed at leisure, at the end of the day, sitting in an armchair and sitting in eggnog. Such notes can reveal startling insights. Of course, one has to ensure that one notes what is noteworthy, and not what is not noteworthy. I confess that on my first few exercises in this regard, I made a complete bollocks of the whole business. I didn't know what I ought to be looking for. I would for example, scribble down my observations of a janitors mopping demeanor, while failing to make a single note about his pail or bucket frenzy. Such frenzies I learned are or can be the key to the janitor spirit guide Nexus. I'm still not sure if that's the word I want. Of course, not all janitorial frenzies are related to this spirit guides. Let's not be silly. Let us instead sink deeper into our armchair, drain our cup of eggnog and drift into a dose in the hope that we may be granted a visit from a shimmering benevolent being from worlds beyond sense. clad in a raincoat, a raincoat, a raincoat, rain or rain.

In the course of my interviews with janitors a surprising number of them let slip that in the buildings for which they would janitorial be responsible. They maintained in addition to the appointed kitchen, a second decoyed kitchen. For what purpose might a janitor do such a thing? That's the question I asked of all the janitors I interviewed, whether they kept decoyed kitchens or not, for I intuited that the replies of those who kept just the one actual kitchen would be as enlightening as those of the janitors who kept to a real kitchen and a decoyed kitchen. Not for the first time, my intuition proved to be wrong. I would not easily forget, for example, how I was caught napping by the Tet offensive. And just as I holiness judged, on an intuitive level, the course of the Vietnam War. So now with my interviews with janitors, when I posed the question about decoyed kitchens to those janitors, the majority who did not keep the core kitchens, they looked at me as if I'd taken leave of my senses. The replies were not in the least enlightening. The general thread of their responses was to avert the maintenance of even a single kitchen was not probably the province of a janitor at all. But in any sane and just universe, big devolved upon a scullery maid. As for the idea that the janitor might keep a decoy kitchen that beggars belief. The most likely explanation I was informed was that those janitors who claimed to have decor kitchens, were pulling the wool over my eyes, playing a drape on me, engaging in a whakaari or somesuch mystery. it grieves me to think I might be the object of mockery or trickery by several Genesis. After all, I had embarked upon my interviews with a good honest heart, I would go so far as to say a pure heart, such as one might find nestling within a pious Victorian infant slowly perishing from tuberculosis. I did not wish to believe that Sam among the janitors would give anything but candid and heartfelt answers to my questions. So I determined to re interview a statistically sound sample of those among the janitors who claimed to keep additional kitchens as decoys. This would necessitate a revision of my schedule, and put me in grave danger of missing my deadline. I comforted myself with the reminder that I had set the deadline myself the entire project to interview thousands of janitors, being wholly within my own remit. For the simple reason that not one among the many publishers I approached, showed even a smidgen of interest in it. Quite the opposite. In fact, I couldn't count the number of times I was physically thrown out into the street. Well, great imposing doors were slammed shut behind me. I bear no grudges and will not copy out the list of those publishers I have written in my own blood in a little black notebook with a skull and crossbones emblem, emblazoned on its cover. So I rejigged my schedule, adding a year or two to my time frame, and made appointments to visit once again, some of the janitors who said that they had established in their buildings decoyed kitchens. In addition to the real kitchens, I devised a new and separate set of questions I wish to ask them. I did not give any of my subjects sight of this question in advance, as I thought the element of surprise would serve me well. Tied to recare in a dark, dank cellar, a Clyde light blazing in his face. Even the speediest and most self possessed janitor in Christendom would quail and confess all when I put my queries to them in a blood curdling screech. I practice the scripture on a hamster or two with trilling but satisfactory result. It was my misfortune, however, that every single one of the janitors I arranged to re interview sent me to decoys sellers decoyed buildings where I was met by decoyed janitors, my project lay in ruins. I intuited that the best idea was to slump in a gutter and let sweet rain fall upon my head. Alas, my intuition proved wrong, for the rain turned to hail,

and the hail turned to snow. And I would have been buried beneath it had I not stood up and dusted myself down and pranced along the street, my head held high, my smile beatific like that of a pious Victorian infant slowly perishing of tuberculosis, who sees dimly through failing eyes, the ethereal glow of an angel of the Lord at his bedside, come to carry him to a better place.

You'll probably be quite relieved to hear that that's all I'm gonna tell you about Janice's for the time being. I still haven't addressed the issue of the janitor and his dog. But I will try and do that, at some point fairly soon. Anyway, browsing in a bookshop the other day, I noticed among than I coughed, I'm going to begin again. Browsing in a bookshop the other day, I noticed among the new titles, a considerable number of books about the new China. I haven't read any of them. And I didn't buy any of them. But I've never really been thinking about the new China, and how it might differ from the old China. I began by wondering if I could gain a grasp of the matter by comparing new labor with old labor. a moment's reflection, however, dissuaded me from going down that path. First, the new China clearly has a definite article, whereas my researches have shown that nowhere was new labor ever referred to as the new labor. Second, while new labor supplanting old labor, has in itself now been replaced by variously blue labor, knew our labor, or simply labor. As far as I've been able to ascertain, this is not yet happened to the new China, which remains the new China, in opposition to the old China. There is one remarkable similarity and one glaring difference between the new China and the old China. I'm sure there are more a week, but these two instances will suffice to get us to the knob. The knob after all, is where we want to be, whether it be the new knob, or the old knob, or just the knob. The similarity is this. To a large extent, one will find that the rivers and the mountains of the new China are almost exactly the same as those of the old China, there may be the occasional small variation, but nothing a geographer of any stripe would deem significant. I'll be writing about the stripes of geographers in another context shortly. On the other hand, the people of the old China have been completely replaced by new people in the new China. If we pluck a year of the old China at random, say 1736, we find that every single one of those old Chinese people is gone. And also that not one of the new Chinese people had yet arrived on the scene. It is of course possible to posit a very different kind of venue China, where all the mountains and rivers have been replaced by new ones, whereas the people are the same. They would be staggering about wizard and wizard and toothless and do Lally without a clue where they were their familiar landmarks the rivers and mountains to ranged and changed utterly in the new China.

It's almost time to go. But so, yes, it's almost time to go. Johnny seven is still sat behind the knobs, doing whatever he does with them. But Dan, who wasn't really helping out anyway, has vanished. So I don't know what that's all about. Maybe I'll never see Dan again. Who knows. But I'm sure Johnny seven will be here next week, at least I hope so. Yeah, I've been reading a book called The spiritualist subtitle, the passion for the occult in the 19th and 20th centuries, by Ruth Branden public published in 1983. And there's some great stuff in it. But I'm going to leave you this week with a little quote about Mrs. Catherine Crowe, who wrote the best selling nightside of nature, published in 1848, which was an enormous compilation of ghost stories and very successful book. And Mrs. Catherine Crowe was found in the street closed only in her chastity, a pocket handkerchief and a visiting card. She had been informed that appeared by the spirits, that if she went in that trim, she would be invisible. That's what the spirits told Catherine Crowe. One of my readers left a comment on hooting, you're saying the use of visiting cards of clothing is a subject well worth investigating. I think he's right. Anyway, that's all for this week. I will say bye bye, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
