Good evening This is in fact hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM, live from London. My name is Frank key and I'm going to read to you for about half an hour, slightly less than half an hour. And there was a piece in the paper the other week about a book that I'd never heard of a reference work called novel openers. First sentences of 11,000 fictional works topically arranged with subject keyword, author and title indexing, compiled by Bruce L. Weaver, and published in 1995. No doubt one could spend many happy hours browsing through it seeking out one's own favorites, cursing the absence of others, and making new discoveries. It set me to thinking by the by that such compilations, whether fat like weavers or brief and idiosyncratic like any number of those lists you find in books and magazines and online, but they always seem to concentrate on first lines or first or whatever fiction. What about arresting openings of nonfiction works? How about this? This is from Sword of wisdom, McGregor majors, and the Golden Dawn by fL cologne. Published in 1975. I was a school girl sitting on a laboratory seat and leaning forward so as to see into the depths of an O z a basket lined with newspapers. The closely printed pages carried an article by a young woman visiting an abbey in Sicily, and described the strange goings on there. The director of the place was someone whom she called the mystic but did not otherwise identify, and his Abbey was far from being an ordinary monastic establishment. I stayed put until I had read through the two or three large pages in spite of imperious rattling the door. Well, that certainly did what Bruce l Weaver suggests is the best way to capture readers instantly put me somewhere else and piqued my curiosity and a page or so later, I was interest introduced to an amusingly intriguing cast of characters. I began to pick up dark hints about the activities of certain unspecified members of whom others were suspicious. The rumors centered around a third studio situated beyond the one used as a library, and their chief disseminator was the librarian or miss Worthington. The members were not all of Miss Worthington's caliber. However, they included Dr. Moses Gaster, the eminent Hebraic, whose youngest daughter was my contemporary at the Slade Hughes Sean field whose scholarly preoccupations did not prevent his founding later, the monster vt and Republic, Dr. Wb Crowe, Grandmaster of the Order of the Holy wisdom, and author and lecturer on traditional themes. Margaret L. Woods, the Edwardian poet, Gerrard, Haim, the scholar and biblio file. And Edward Langford Gaston, who was Secretary of the society has our chemical treatises, theology, and the secret fire not yet published. This is a peculiarly British or English shabby genteel world of the interwar years, suburban mystics scraping by on invisible means their secret wisdom unsuspected by their neighbors, and often unintelligible even to their disciples. Later, iselle Kowloon is invited to a weekend in the country.

The basic formula for such establishments is a simple one, get hold of a large house and garden also a bit of Berlin industrias wife and or a selection of concubines with similar qualities, then collect disciples of both sexes, willing not only to pay for their keep, but to work for it. you recommend work in house and garden for its therapeutic value, but it also saves you the expense of employing staff. The formula was used successfully for a number of years early this century by Mr. gurdjieff at Fontainebleau by Crowley, more briefly at his Abbey of Fela calf ALU in the early 1920s, and by pd uspensky in the 30s, when he occupied at least two different properties in the home counties to expand the cynical remarks that behind every Western teacher is a boarding house or a brothel, I would put Meredith star a new spin ski into the first category. But if reports of inmates are exact, there were at least elements of the second shamers to gurdjieff and Crowley and Sophie arrives at frogmore on a chilly November day, met at the nearest station by her host in a battered car. frogmore proved to be a red brick gabled house set on sloping ground, the atmosphere of the domain at once struck me as gloomy. The interior no less so. The dining hall was somberly panels and almost without illumination, we all sat at a long table with Meredith at the head. The diet strictly food reform was far from being the delicious fare vegetarian food cannon should be. I remember a tasteless soup with something like barley kernels in suspension. Also home cooked cabbage leaves like dark linoleum. Why these could not have been chopped up seasoned and served with an appetizing source. I don't know. Perhaps that would have destroyed their virtue. Writing in the 1970s Sal cologne looks back and sees parallels with the present. My room was cold cramped and shabby. When later I described it to Margo. Very simple, she murmured with a faraway look. But is it simple when all water has to be carried, the lavatory is a long way down a spooky corridor, and the only warmth comes from hot bottles. It's an earth closet in the garden that has to be emptied periodically, really simpler than main drainage. Or rather, there's not the absence of mod cons make far less simple household running than if things were arranged with a little common sense. I suspect that today, some hippie girls, after enthusiastically integrating themselves with the commune learn this same fact the hard way. Life may be simple for their men, if these do little but discuss what they call philosophy. But how about the women to keep even relatively warm, clean and fed in primitive conditions is more difficult than in squarer surroundings. Incidentally, how far outdated is much hippie ideology when it comes to considering women as human beings, or failing to consider them at all? 40 years on from this spot on observation of hippies. She's still skewers in a few simple sentences, the inanities of those of our 21st century eco warriors who'd like nothing better than to plunge us into a pre industrial Dark Age. I've quoted far beyond the startling opening paragraph. But doing so proves the point, I suppose. Read it and you're hooked on 50 pages in and I'm looking forward to the rest of the book with immense glee. Since I wrote that there was another paragraph that leapt out at me from the same book. Apparently the kind of paragraph that leaves you wanting to know more. An episode is highlighted in ritual magic in England 1970 by Francis King, who misled by Dion fortunes account of it accused Marina majors of killing a Miss netta for nereo by black magic, as the incident leading to Miss formularios death did not take place until some 18 months after marinas own the charges scarcely worth refuting. Even if the latter had been living the town of cops as a result from either in the form of a monster cat than from running naked in the dark over Rough Country, which Miss fornari immediately below collapse.

Moving on then, this week's news of Dobson the out of print pamphleteer also a 20th century figure like Sal Kowloon Dobson's pamphlet an entirely new system of mass drains. Incorporating flexible leather and lead pipes, a plastic funnel and adoption jar out of print is truthfully notable for the inclusion in its title of the latter item. It's the only known record as this container, as indeed, it's the single instance of the celebrated pamphleteer, claiming to have an eponymous receptacle. The text itself assumes that the reader is familiar with the Dobson jar, as if one had a whole row of them lined up in one's pantry. Though of course, neither you nor I have ever met anyone who owns such a jar, or knows anybody who has blank stares and possible dribbling. Meet the Enquirer who haunts antique fairs, car boot sales and Gumball extravaganzas in pursuit of the chimerical container. In any case, one jar is much like the other as you will know If like me, you've made a study of jars are not just any old study, but a thorough, rigorous scholarly study, the kind of study that we do not just a Post Graduate Diploma in jar studies, at the awarding of which you happily sport a gas, gold vermilion cap and robe, but a badge, a badge depicting a jar or sort of a jar. The jar of jars also have gas, gold vermilion, which you can wear on your tunic or cardigan to display your Jari credentials in jar circles. Dobson came late too late to Moscow drainage matters for this important subject had already been addressed comprehensively by Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles when he was not turning his attention to the slave trade, witches, lunacy priests, eugenics, aeroplanes, submarines, hygiene, the action of flowers, the habits of animals, modern novels krisztian ethics for drink question micro scopic researches the theory and structure of language Willow the wisps and homology evolution visible or luminous music fogs and frost, electricity, wooden chessmen, double power, Ferro plows, artificial birds, perpetual motion diving bells, vegetation and evaporation Dobson Of course, right pamphlets on some not all of these subjects as the fancy took him who has read his pamphlet on artificial birds without weeping. Well, I have actually I had a jar at hand to catch my tears. Should I shed any but I did not. The jar was not a Dobson jar, as far as I'm aware. For I do not know if I would recognize the Dobson jar if I saw one. as I've indicated, our pamphleteering Titan gives us no clues in his out of print pamphlet as to what the jar named after him might look like. I suspect there never was such a jar. I think Dobson was hoping to find a secondary route to a mortality, reckoning that even if all his herculean pamphleteering efforts were swept into the abyss and forgotten, his name would live on forever, or at least for as long as people made use of jars. It was a foolish conceit. But then Dobson was a rather foolish and conceited man. It's worth pointing out before I close that the system of mosque drainage propounded by the pamphleteer in his pamphlet, is utterly nonsensical and fails to drain even the tiniest smidgen of moisture from any patch of moss to which it's applied. I should know because I tried it. There is some moss on a wall I passed by often on my travels, and one gusty wet morning, I set about it following Dobson's instructions to the letter as best I could. The upshot was a teetering wall, a broken arm, and a patch of moss, if anything more moist than it was when I rolled up with my equipment just before dawn, my arm was in a cast for six weeks, during which time moss grew upon the plaster as it will if conditions are right for the growth of moss. I made no attempt to drain it.

Here's something I wrote the other day. Normally when I write things I'm very aware of what I'm doing. But this I don't know. I don't know what this is about. I'll read it as it came out. Carry me down from the hills. They Horrible hills carry me down from the horrible hills in a Palin keen. Do not shake me as you carry me. I'm already shuttering from the horror of the hills. tread carefully. There is no path. There is no path nor beaten track down from the hills. There are innumerable puddles carry me carry me in my palate and keen eye language in my pal and keen, like a symbolist a seat, but my moustache is unwaxed and flecked with spittle. I did much spitting in the horrible hills. I spat and spat bile in the gorge, more all jitters I shall not spit in my pal and Keine carry me down from the hills. In the puddles live many bugs and beetles. They attach themselves to your ankles and bite you, you my carriers. They cannot bite me for I am beyond their reach in my pal and keen. It's draperies a tattered and torn but I am clued up. Yes, I'm all clued up and wise to tricks and box hot. Carry me carry me down with all due haste. For we must reach the plane before midnight strikes. I have a fob watch to tell the time. I'm checking, checking, checking the time each quarter minute. When midnight strikes. The 20th century begins. Oh carry me.

Apparently, this is weird, mysterious crackling sound this week. But I hope that's not going to spoil your enjoyment. And if it does, you can write to me write to me that write to resonance write to me and I will sort it out. How I don't know. apropos of that last piece, which I said that I didn't actually know what it was really about myself. Here's something else that's relevant to this begins with a quote from john Ruskin the great john Ruskin from the mystery of life and its Arts in 1868. I have had what in many respects I boldly call the misfortune to set my words sometimes prettily together, not without a foolish vanity and the poor knack that I had of doing so. Until I was heavily punished for this pride by finding that many people thought of the words only and cared nothing for them, meaning no such problem for me, I'm happy to say for judging by my bulging postcard, almost all of my readers and listeners devote many hours to code rotating upon the meaning indeed the multiple meanings of each and every reading at hooting yard. But just in case there are one or two of you out there who still tragically overlook significance of the expensive Verbal brazza I thought it would be helpful to pluck from that postcard, post bag, one person that letter and reproduce it in full. It's from Tim thurn, who can often be a picky rancor, but whose devotion to hooting yard has never been in doubt. Ahoy there Frank. He writes in that annoying way he has. I thought you might be interested to hear about the little routine I've devised for myself to help me Winkle out the deep and deeper meanings of your many and various pieces that you've read out. This is what I do. As soon as I finished listening, I'd get up from my chair and go straight to the bathroom, wherein I fill a sink with ice cold water, steep it in a towel, steep in it a towel, and then wrap the towel tight about my head. This is to prevent my brain from overheating. I next gargle from Dr Baxter's effervescent and volatiles gargling fluid and cut a few capers while gargling though the vigor of my capers is constrained somewhat by the cramped dimensions of my bathroom. The next step is to go down to my cellar, a dank pit which light never penetrate until I sprawled on the floor. Before sprawling however, I fumble about in the blackness to locate my vintage Bakelite cassette player and depress the knob which sets the tape going. The tape, which is a loop and which is that's always ready to play is a recording of the urbane Blodgett sex Tet performing the song cycle drinky every one the waters have his own system until I come and take you away. I don't know why, but I find this music perfectly suited to the code rotations I must now embark upon while sprawled in the darkness. The SEC Tet, lean and flashy songs great on there scramble pipes of record straw, which is my kind of music. Ours may pass as I plumb the depths of my mental basin, thinking over the hooting yard, piece I lightly listened to sooner or later the meaning or meanings become clear or not just clear but in can destined. It's almost as if there is actual light in the cellar. Almost. I fumble for the cassette player, press the stop knob and blunder my way up and out. The towel around my head is usually still damp, so I wring it out over the bathroom sink and hang it up to dry before dashing out in the streets to buttonhole passers by with an excitable account of my new knowledge. I thoroughly recommend this method of discovering the many many profundities inherent in the hooting yard herbal and I'm so grateful to you Mr. Key that I'm even tempted to make a donation, but only tempted for on reflection. I much prefer to wallow in a puddle of moral turpitude and filth, like the sordid in great I am passionately yours, Tim thurn.

a donation but you can. And I discovered that the podcasts of these shows which were about three or four months behind the live additions are listened to by thousands of people, thousands and if every one of those thousand people sent me a pound, I'd be inordinately rich. But of course most people don't. However, if you're listening to this and you'd like to help her insolvent and ragged pamphleteer, and Scribbler, please do donate if you go to the hooting yard website or hooting yard.org apart from having thousands, if not millions of words to read, and some pictures to look at, you can buy some books and you can make a donation and that would be very nice and it would help me immensely because I don't get paid for this. So yeah, do that. End of begging letter onwards. One of the more unusual features of pointy town is that it's sought some Topaz gathering beer palaces and gin gardens, rather than the more familiar vise versus this idiosyncratic arrangement of drinking dens is sought to date back to the time of Robin Hood. The bricklaying outlaw dressed all in green, who stole from a ditch to give to a bore. Who knew there were bores in pointy town? It's possible the lies misheard or misunderstood the legend. witted at me by a passing storyteller I met on a beaten track, and that Robin Hood fences stolen goods to a bore, B double o r, or even a bore b o r e, rather than a bore with a capital B. e. r. There are plenty of balls and balls in pointy town as you quickly learn if you spend any time in one of the beer palaces or gin gardens, what's always puzzled me more than the possible colony of ex Pat boas in pointy town is the nature of Robin Hood, hot ditch theft. I mean, what could you come upon in the average ditch that would be worth stealing some mud. brackish puddle of water rife with tiny wriggling beings are broken and Rusty and abandoned pram or bicycle. Certainly not the latter. For the dictators of pointy town, a famous for the free of such unsightly excrescences swept clean or clean ish as they are once a week on a rotation system by the appointed town ditch maintenance patrol. It is thought that Robin hoard recruited his so called Merry Men from the ranks of disaffected or incapable patrol has beens he tried to teach them bricklaying, but the lure of the beer palaces and gin gardens was too powerful. It was almost magnetic, if you can imagine such a thing.

Anyway to end this week, I hope you've enjoyed the show and I just like to end with this marches. I'm enamored of the idea of sun worship as practiced by Aztec fundamentalists and the islanders in The Wicker Man, among others. I cannot help but feel that john donne was right when he described the golden orb as a busy old fool. At hooting yard, it's usually overcast or raining or snow smothered, which is just how we like it. To those of you who live in snowless regions, be advised that snow is nothing else but the foam or froth of rainwater from heaven. One person who I suspect would have agreed with me was the painter Carl vecka. When asked if he chose to live in Cornwall, because of the quality of the light, he replied, Cornish light, I've got a 60 watt light bulb and I keep the curtains closed. So that's what you should do. 60 watt light bulb, keep the curtains closed and listen to hooting yard. And I'll be back next week with more stuff for you. Have a good week. Bye bye
