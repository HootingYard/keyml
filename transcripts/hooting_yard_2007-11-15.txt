Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. As usual, it's 30 minutes long this program half an hour, but that doesn't mean that we haven't got time for thousands of unusual and arresting facts about birds. Thousands of unusual and arresting facts about birds was one of the fattest pamphlets Dobson ever published. The title is something of a misnomer, for the remarkable thing about this work is that it contains Not a single fact about birds whatsoever. Indeed, apart from the occasional passing mention of stylings page 49 Shrike klutz, page 92 and a swan page 119 birds are signally absent from the text. In spite of this, the pamphlet has been hailed by the upstart young Dobson his Ted CAC, as, quote, the most informative text on ornithology that I have ever read. Unquote. CAC is not always the most intellectually agile of critics though, so perhaps we should not take him too seriously. The way we might Pharaoh our brows in deep concentration that even the mere wrist squib from a theoretical Colossus like say, Terry Eagleton. Dobson wrote the pamphlet at a time when he was preoccupied with moles. He was fascinated by their borrowing habits, near blindness and twitching snout, although the snouts of moles twitch less than those of shrews, particularly elephant shrews. Dobson was enamored of what he considered the more Moly twitching of the snout of moles. Why then, did he not say a pamphlet of unusual interesting facts about moles rather than birds? When it was moles that intrigued him during this period? It should be noted that his tract makes no mention of moles either. a clue may be found in the fact that at the time of the pamphlets writing, Dobson was engaged in a feud with a bellicose Undertaker from down pointy town way. No one can be quite sure anymore what caused the vendetta, not even Ted Kak, who admits to us a bit flummoxed meant about the whole matter. But there was an exchange of letters among nacelles and in one of these the out of print pamphleteer wrote as follows. Not only are you a singularly bellicose Undertaker, sir, but you keep the seats in your death carried you in a very greasy condition. My Dry Cleaners have the devil of a job returning my trousers to their usual impeccability after last I sat upon those seats when attending the funeral rites of thruxton shore beppo, the noted mole and bird expert whose friendship I had come to treasure. It is true that I have not sought from new financial recompense for the cost of decreasing my trousers, but that is only because I have a more terrible revenge in mind. the authenticity of this letter has been questioned, chiefly because the last thing one tends to associate with Dobson is a pair of impeccable trousers. I'm not suggesting that he was forever covered in Greece, far from it. But a certain shabbiness, even grubbing us was part of his general aura, even the aura detected by our psychic brethren and sistren, as attested by the redoubtable Madame boo boo, who sometimes did readings of the pamphlets ethereal pamphleteers, ethereal being Dobson himself was unaware of these, as the turbaned mme was given to following him about skulking down alleyways or creeping after him as he wrecked, anointed picnicking spots in fields and Parkland. She would target him from behind with her fearsome gaze and make visible his aura for long enough to allow her to scribble a few notes into her psychic Notepad. Often such notes contain the word grubby, grimy, disheveled, and splattered with a mark. And remember, that was his spiritual aura, not his solid Earthbound person. Anyway, whether it's genuine or not, it's the reference in the letter to three roxton shore beppo that concerns us here. Dobson or the counterfeiter, pretending to be Dobson correctly identifies the deceased beppo as a mold and bird expert,

as indeed he was, and one who the pamphleteer met often in the final days of his, the Marlin bird experts life. They first encountered each other at a football match. Red Star Hoon versus Pang Hill academicals, where Dobson had gone to make a tape recording of turnstile clacking noises, and beppo was present as a turnstile clacking counter. It may seem to be unusual employment for a mole and bird expert. But beppo was the kind of impoverished amateur who was perpetually short of cash. And on this particular day, he was actually very close to starvation. It is thought that Dobson took pity on the skeletal clack counter and tossed him a pastry from his bag, much as one might feed a zoo animal. The two men rapidly hit it off. And indeed, there was something juvenile in their cameraderie they addressed each other by foolish code names broadsword, and Danny Boy, using these super cats as an excuse to practice their impersonations of Richard Burton and Michael Hordern in the film where Eagles dare. Incidentally, the film's screenplay, and the novel on which it is based, were written by the alcoholic Scottish writer Alistair McLean, who is buried just yards away from Richard Burton in a Swiss graveyard. Several of Alistair Maclean's novels include the phrase the huddled, shapeless pneus of the dead, suggesting that this was an IT a fix a lodged in the writers gin soaked cranium, perhaps on unvanquished herbal memory from his war service and the Royal Navy, where he was involved in action in the Atlantic Theater on to Arctic convoys and escorting carrier groups in operations against Tirpitz and other targets of the Norwegian coast in 1944, in the Mediterranean theater, as part of the invasion of southern France, and in helping to blockade runners of Crete and bombard me loss in the agrarian sea, and in 1945, in the Far East theater, escorting carrier groups and operations against Japanese targets in Burma, Malaya and Sumatra. McLean's late in life claims that he was captured by the Japanese and tortured have been dismissed by both his son and his biographer as drunken ravings. The huddled, shapeless pneus of the dead is also the title of an exceedingly rare and out of print Dobson pamphlet, a piece of fluff about dead bees. Dobson and Bebo began to meet daily common during a corner table in the cow and pins tavern, where they talked for hours about both birds and moles. The expert knew his days were numbered, as he had already been diagnosed with the invariably fatal withered innards syndrome. And it may be that he wanted to pass on his knowledge before he died. intriguingly in his eight decades beppo had not once put pen to paper, and his matchless store of information about birds and moles. He carried entirely in his head. And what I headed was diversified. Dennis beer pint once described it in conversation rather than in a poem as, quote, bear pose head, that great block of human head dense and solid and mottled like a potato. Unquote. He made this remark during one of his rare television appearances on the shadrach and abednego chat show, on which he was a guest in the week after babos death. There were others lined up to extol the burden model expert, including songstress Kathy Kirby, and bowler hatted Avengers star Patrick McKinney, but bear pint would not stop babbling, and in those days of live broadcasts and the more spontaneous approach, he was allowed to continue until the next program, a three hour silent, black and white documentary about swans was due to begin. It was of course, on a different edition of the same track show that bear pint became the first person to utter the word lubuntu on television. If either moles or birds were mentioned in Dobson's pamphlet, thousands of unusual interesting facts about birds, we could draw the sensible conclusion that the pamphleteer had simply mixed up the fantastic amount of information poured After beppo over that Tavern table, but as we have seen, moles are not mentioned in the text at all, and birds only in passing.

Were in then lies the enigma of the seemingly gratuitous title. One possibility is that Dobson was using a code akin to the childish broadsword and Danny boy with which the pair of aging rascals addressed each other. If so, I do not think it's a code anyone is going to crack. Dobson left a teeming pile of notebooks and scribblings catalogued by Allah wishes nesting burden others with heroic diligence, and it seems to me that somewhere in that paper Kilimanjaro, they would have found a scrap upon which the pamphleteer worked out his cipher. If a cipher it was the bumptious noodle head and pretend Dobson scholar Emmerich, Vin van Lew made a fool of himself with his claim that the pamphlets title was an anagram of lubuntu and dust can be no fruits of a horrid essays, assault gas, chiefly because it isn't. That did not stop him weaving a ludicrous fantasy that Dobson and Bebo were engaged in some kind of top secret paramilitary gas experimentation program, with only one commentator dismissed Vin van ruse ravings as like something out of an Alistair McLean novel, demonstrating a contextual grasp of the whole Dobson beppo affair which I quite envy. I'm doing my best You see, but though I've studied the pamphlet for years now, I can still make head nor tail of what Dobson was driving at. Usually you know where you stand with his titles. How I poked a pointed stick into a hedge is a pamphlet in which Dobson writes about poking a pointed stick into a hedge. Christ stopped eberly is about Christ, stopping at eberly granted in both of these works, as with almost all his pamphlets, Dobson veers off into surprising digressions. But generally speaking, he takes his subject his fad or whim of the moment, and rings out of it all can be wrong, and more. Even the youthful callow Ted cat has had the insight that, quote, whatever the topic of his pamphlet, Dobson's ambition was to have the last word to make any further approach to the subject whatever it was futile for at least a century and preferably longer. Whether writing about carpet beetles or electrical wiring systems, or a dub version of the soundtrack to Carl Sagan television series cosmos. Dobson worried away at his theme, like a small predatory beast, knowing upon the limp body of a smaller, non predatory beast from which the life was rapidly draining, as it were a Tawny owl with a hamster or a shrew with a newborn goat, for example, unquote. So if we take Ted cacs metaphor, and think of Dobson as a Tony owl or shrew, what kind of hamster or newborn goat is he tearing to pieces in thousands of unusual and arresting facts about birds? Is that a question to which we can ever give a sensible answer? Well, I think we can. Not today maybe, and perhaps not tomorrow, nor even this week, nor next week, or next month, may even under St. lupis day, but I will promise this much. By the time you are all celebrating the next st. lupis day, I will publish the mighty tome on which I have labored like an idiot for the last. God knows how many years. I long ago lost count of the number of tallow candles. I've burned to light my futuristic flame resistant reinforced plastic writer's cabin, where I crouch scribbling away through days and nights, year after year, sustained only by a peculiar soup based nutrients, slop, and by a blinding conviction that my privations are worthwhile, because I shall finally pierce the shroud of ignorance enveloping Dobson's fattest pamphlet and when on that merry day, the annotated pop up edition of thousands of unusual interesting facts about birds by Dobson with a preface introduction notes commentary afterward exegesis maps, color plates, exquisite binding, greaseproof wrapper and presentation crate guaranteed free of infestation by microscopic paper devouring beings hits the shelves of your local supermarket. I shall smash my way out of my cabin, and scamper through the meadows, flailing my arms. beaming with glee.

trudging around an autumn nearly gone seaside resort the other day, I was halted in the street by a municipal person armed with a clipboard. It was questionnaire time, I gave a series of succinct if baleful replies to queries about my views on the various amenities and attractions of the town and walked onward towards the deserted beach. I mentioned this only because, as I stood staring out to see in the Dying Light, I wished I'd been in a hooligans Wharf, instead of where I was, for then my answer to the question, how do you write to the local museum would have been neither succinct nor baleful, but gambling and over enthusiastic, wildly so. For it is in Oh hooligans Wharf that you will find my absolute favorite Museum in the world. I cannot begin to explain why the Imperial Museum of rotting vegetable matter and other agricultural waste product holds me in such a spell each time I visit. It's matchless collection of rotting vegetable matter and other agricultural waste product is unrivaled by any museum anywhere. It's special collections of silos and slurry jewels, which any museum curator would kill for. notoriously one curator did just that. But his evil scheme was found out and he was transported to a drab rock, a speck of volcanic gabbro girt by mighty seas, where he ended his days being pecked at by orcs and petrols. What once had been the Imperial Palace, where scenes of decadence and debauchery played out under the yellow light of 1000 paced week Landon's his palatial still, and the more so now that room upon room upon room is packed to bursting with sacks of rotting vegetable matter and other agricultural waste product in place of the pointy chin area stoves and Royal grotesques who played and partied and waltz and vomited here in the old times. The lanterns still shed there on earthly paste with light, but how truly splendid now the recipients of that yellow gleam sack after sack in tidy rows in stack upon stack, rotting and pungent I said that the museum holds me in it spell each time I visit. And that's true, but it's not the whole truth. For I'm held in it spell constantly, whether I've taken the day's long shower bank ride to Oh, hooligans Wharf, or whether I have not. For at night I dream of the sacks of rotting vegetable matter and other agricultural waste product. I dream of them each and every night. And I think of them in my waking daydreams too. Every single day. For that doomed curator who was packed out on the gabbro was my father, and I hold his memory dear. I too would kill if I could, but take possession of the signage in the slurry, the rot and the sludge, the mold and the mush and the muck.

Another thing that happened when I was trudging around the alternately glum seaside resort, was that I received an unsolicited pancake hint, I'd stopped to tighten the loose shoelace near an ice cream kiosk. The Kiosk was shot it being blustery and cloud lowering and out of season. A busy with a demented number of bags passed me by stopped and turn just as I was straightening up from my shoelace tying exertions in a mournful voice. She offered me a pancake hint, then went on her way. This was not the first time I had been given a pancake. came to the seaside resort. And as I headed off towards the steep steps up to a lawn and a crazy golf facility, I cast my mind back to an earlier occasion. It was a different seaside resort, and a different pancake hint, but the weather was similar, and so Curiously, was the Biddy though this previous Billy had fewer bags about her person, and we were nowhere near an ice cream kiosk. That made to seaside based pancake hints. You might think the making of pancakes is a simple matter and that I've been given two hints too many, but I disagree. Whenever I make pancakes I like to mull over the hints I have received both that pair of seaside ones and the other pancake hints given in wholly different circumstances far inland. I would not claim always to act upon the hints for I think we all tend towards our own habitual pancake making techniques without really giving them much thought. Dobson was a glorious exception. He never made his pancakes in the same way twice. He would take a conscious pause As he approached his skillet and summon to mind one of the numberless pancake hints stored in his throbbing cranium. How he selected the hint he was about to use is the subject of one of his most engaging pamphlets on the judicious and non repeating deployment of pancake hints out of print. intriguingly, Dobson mentions in a footnote on page nine, that He also received one of his pancake hints at the seaside, though maddeningly, he does not inform the reader at which resort mine do, nor have I. And in my case, there are two seaside resorts you will be thumping your forehead against a solid panel in frustration that I have failed to divulge. But one day I plan to write my own pancake pamphlet sort of homage to Dobson's and until then, I'm keeping mum.

The following piece contains a character called beppo. Not to be confused with the beppo in thousands of on that unusual and arresting fact about birds. This is a different beppo evidence of my matchless ability to invent character names. I think I've said that before, which is evidence of my matchless ability to think of banter between stories anyway. Here it is. A topic of consuming interest to a number of people is the manner in which detective Captain Kirk pan cut his crime fighting chops so impassion to some that there is a weekly magazine to cater to their needs. In titled, oh kargh pan that Valve were with us still, in which Beatle brown fans like nothing better to do with nothing better to do publish lengthy and frankly tedious disquisitions upon the earlier cases of the renowned copper. A short extract will give will suffice to give you some idea of the content. And this is the kind of article that you read, I'll quote it. Later that summer karg pan was assigned to the team which had been trying fruitlessly to solve the mysterious case of the pod persons from poor lock. acting on a tip off from combine. The ambitious young detective took fruit with him to his first briefing. His plums were bruised, but he calculated correctly, that the investigation would no longer be fruitless. His colleagues on the case were Kandinsky for Aero Russia, pabulum squit, crane neck, Solomon Gilly black hinges Darjeeling, men's sauna pilih pap kuben Houben Thera panty CAC and tubin, wesc, flopper Ruskin Whistler, Pinkerton, Paris, Paris SC, Periscope boo boo concept album where we've all fanfares desk Sergeant grease jacket, desk Sergeant grease jackets performing monkey flamboyant man, Elspeth duck wind, live and grow rasa last Pompidou and vampire threadbare pot gak snap tittle pan for long Risk assessor cow fat loon Hoon, bat limb goon Fang Chow hanger lip, Kim Park goon trilby Baxter syrup, slop Shandy Martin a miss wall gatherer poopsie Clutterbuck poopsie Clutterbuck, crippled nephew, Simon, whose name was Peter, a pool of sokongan temporary volunteers, and some horses all under the command of super Captain Fastow copy, no relation to the legendary cyclist of that name. So this is the kind of thing that the old kargh pan that there were with us still readers adore. No doubt it took prodigious research to compile that list of team members. But those of us with a less specialist approach are left wondering how or even if the case of the pod persons from porlock was solved. The author of the piece does not tell us nor does she follow up the ramifications of karg pans provision of a basket of fruit. Later in his career, of course, like many fictional detectives, Detective Captain kargh pan had a trusty assistant of Watson to his homes, you will find no mention of beppo in the umpteen thousand pages of the bound volumes of oak hog pan that there were with us still held in the reference library at pointy town, nor in any of the myriad other journals devoted to the cuttings of colored pens crime fighting chops. beppo was not yet born when the great detective joined the Constabulary, Constabulary and it was not until the famous case of the politician the lighthouse and the trained cormorant, that the diminutive helped me to appeared on the scene. Interestingly, this case is one that the aforementioned Dr. Watson attributed in passing to Sherlock Holmes, Watson made this something of a habit fair, he also tried to claim credit for a number of karg pannon beppo adventures, including the singular affair of the elementium crotch, the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby, the banker, the arrest of Wilson, the notorious Canary trainer, and the one in which his adoro persona, the well known journalist and journalist, was found stuck staring mad with a matchbox in front of him, which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science.

Such true life tales of detection and derring do have thrilled generations. What is less well known is that when kargh pan eventually retired from the force, and went off to some rustic backwater to keep bees and wasps beppo struck out on his own as a private investigator. Very few of his solo adventures have ever been made public, possibly due to their unremitting tedium. Poor beppo was unfortunate, in that he was only ever employed by clients fretting about the state of their taps, or their hedges, or defective electric socket, or a cat in a tree or run last bus pass. He took to drink and was last heard of wandering aimlessly around the gloomy suburbs of tan tower beam, emitting Noxious Fumes with every breath and shouting his head off at snack bar hooligans. And that's the end of putting out on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. Visit the website, go and read stuff there. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
