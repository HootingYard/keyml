This is indeed resonance 104 M. Live from London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I don't suppose that you would have tuned into hooting yard to get all the latest news from the wonderful world of rock and pop. But that's what you're going to get at the beginning of this week show. Plus sirens. That's what you're going to get at the beginning of this week's show because the sirens are because we have the windows open. And so you get lots of kind of ambient sound from Berra High Street, but I think you can cope. I think you'll be able to cope with that. I can so you shall write? Where was I? Yes, the wonderful world of rock and pop, not normally a hooting yard subject but it is this week, because this week, well, not gonna bring you all the news from the wonderful world of rock and pop. Some of it well, not even some of it, just one bit of it. And the one bit is exciting news. An exciting new calm beat combo called the narcoleptic Presbyterians. Actually they're not a combo it's just a judo. It's a judo formed by two well known stars from different spheres of rock and pop, in fact, different generations, and the band is named after them. narcoleptic is an anagram of Eric Clapton and Presbyterians of course, is an anagram of Britney Spears. So Eric and Brittany have got together as as kind of an anagram at ised Judo or something.

onwards to more familiar terrain now, with a piece about Dobson Dobson's pamphlet, sings beginning with B out of print is chiefly remarkable for the paucity of things beginning with B to which it attends. After a few ill tempered preparatory remarks in which the 20th century, Titanic pamphleteer gets off his chest certain moans and grumbles about rain and modern swans, he embarks upon a surprisingly knowledgeable account of bees. This display of unlikely learning puzzled Dobson is for many a year until Allah wishes nesting bird discovered that the passage is copied out in its entirety from a Victorian work of natural history and titled, everything a sickly Victorian infant needs to know about bees, wasps and Hornets by Mrs. lacrimas based Dobson next announces that he's going to give the most thorough account of breakfast ever attempted in English prose. He does not following a short paragraph about eggs, containing nothing that the average hen coop observer would not learn in a morning. The pamphleteer asserts that the breakfast of the future will be smokers Pop Tarts, a product at that time, newly introduced to the ever burgeoning breakfast food market while admitting that he has yet to try this to some savory himself. Dobson sings the praises of the smokers popped up to so ludicrous and extent that one suspect he was in the pay of the manufacturers. As indeed he was, it was nesting bird again who Winkle that the embarrassing truth facing a large gas bill and a fine imposed upon him for an offense described as throwing pebbles with menace swans. Dobson was more than usually desperate for cash. And it seems that when a representative from the smokers Pop Tarts Manufacturers Association came a calling. The pamphleteer struck a shabby Deal. As hairy persons in the 1960s might have put it he sold out to the man man. Vast it is that the bulk of things beginning with B is nothing more than an extended pie enter smokers Pop Tarts for having exhausted his flights of Wittering guff about the breakfast product. Dobson brings the pamphlet to an abrupt close with the preposterous claim that Bs and breakfast aside, there is nothing much of any interest that begins with the letter B. It is not known how much money Dobson received for his pop tart puffery. The records show that although the swans and pebbles related fine was paid in full, his gas supply was cut off on the Sand Creek Day event here and not reinstated until the first day of Vice President Nixon's visit to Venezuela, as recounted in six crises. 1962 before we move on, I should mention that I'm currently working on a forthcoming Encyclopedia of eggs. Regarding the eggs mentioned briefly in the previous piece, the Encyclopedia of eggs will be a thumping great tome, including everything that human beings know about eggs of all kinds. And here just for the hell of it is one of the entries. It's under the heading fiction, eggs in quotations regarding and the quotation is from a novel by Patrick Harper called the rapture from 1986. She gave him his own egg, but he was so overwhelmed that he froze and holding it well away from his body. repeated the word egg with great difficulty.

I should perhaps explain that those two lists comprise the contents of the only two additions of a decisively obscure magazine entitled the funnel, conceived and written by Dobson and edited and published by marigold shrew. Dobson was insanely jealous of the success of the Reader's Digest, every single issue of which sold more copies than even his most popular pamphlets. trudging along one morning past the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing, it occurred to him that whereas his pamphlet tended, in the main to address one subject at a time, the great attraction of the Reader's Digest was its variety. Each copy came packed with diverting disquisitions on topics as various John's kidney escapes from impairment, Jane's liver as tech antiquities, anti communist hysteria and astrological flummery. To hell with pamphlets, shouted the pamphleteer at a Siskin perched upon a bow. The Siskin is in the words of one ornithologist, an attractive little Finch. But it has no understanding of human speech so Dobson's words were wasted. But when he arrived home having plotted around the edge of the Erie Marsh, he repeated his imprecation, to marigold to Gosh, she said, adding, you could just staple four or five pamphlets together, and that would provide the variety you seek Dobson? Have you actually seen the Reader's Digest shattered Dobson? It covers far more than four or five topics. It's so packed with pros that its binding needs a spine, unlike virtually every other magazine available at this point in the 20th century. So stapled 10 or a dozen pamphlets together, Dobson said marigold to know staple is big or sturdy enough for the popular magazine. I envisage shouted Dobson, and he began pouring milk into a bowl. Over the following weeks and months, the pamphleteer and his inner merata thrashed out the details of a publication. Dobson was convinced would have the editor of the Reader's Digest, either, groveling pitilessly at his feet, or banging his head repeatedly against the damp stone walls of an EU berliet in a secure facility for lunatics. issue of the as yet untitled magazine would contain not 10 not a dozen but 13 articles penned by Dobson, but with titles provided by marigold to she would enter into a shamanistic trance frenzy, cavorting dizzily around a bonfire in the back garden, twigs and bones and feathers in twined in her hair, and someone from eldritch Tony Buzan entities, a set of two word titles based on the alphabet, issue one or the QWERTY keyboard layout issued to vast asbestos bales. coppers dungeon eloquent filth glad some holidays illegal jackknives kinky lobster muddy noggin obtuse pop straw Quaker riots, slobbering throwback untimely verger wax x axis yodeling zany in issue one and queasy woodpecker ergot root toxic yeast unimaginable idiocy orange pips our Beano Starling deathblow tiller kashering hazard jellied Cole lethal zookeeper x rayed clinker, vertiginous banisters nothing more in issue two, fueled by plentiful tumblers of aerated radish water. Dobson would write all the articles in one marathon scribble a THON the reams and reams and reams of dazzling prose typesetting just stettner by marigold true and untold millions of copies piled high in a convoy of container lorries revving their diesel engines outside the house, ready to fan out across the land to doctors and dentists waiting rooms, and other carefully selected distribution points.

on a Thursday night, in November, marigold true induced a shamanistic trance frenzy and delivered for the 26 titles for Dobson to crack on with dawn, brandishing the flayed skin of a wolf on which the titles were dogged in her own blood. She went looking for the pamphleteer who was nowhere to be found in the house. She found him beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing slumped in the muck weeping. Here Dobson, she cried still in a partial frenzy, the content of issues one and two of the funnel are ready for you wrenched from realms beyond sense. But Dobson continued to weep, clawing at the mud. All is hopeless, hopeless, he whimpered. I have just been apprised by Sputnik or some such Space Age contraption. The latest Reader's Digest circulation figures. I must be mad to think I could ever match them. No marigold, I'm afraid it's back to the drudgery of pamphleteering for me, tell the convoy of container lorries to drive away empty. I shall weep and claw some more, and then I shall come home and pour milk into a bowl. Right Whoa. Dobson said marigold too brightly, and I shall put the kettle on and pop the smokers Pop Tarts into the toaster. And thus dawned a Friday morning in November. Far, far away in Texas, Lee Harvey Oswald woke from an uneasy sleep got ready for work, and before leaving the house, plopped his wedding ring into a little China tea cup that once belonged to his wife's grandmother.

Right onwards, another quotation now this is from an 1895 volume by by Jason Lowe straight tree. I don't know if they're related to Litton strategy, I doubt it somehow. Jason Lowe stretchy, who compiled dogs stories from the spectator being anecdotes of the intelligence, reasoning, power, affection and sympathy of dogs selected from the correspondence columns of the spectator. And this piece, it consists of two well the letter that was originally written to the spectator and a reply. And the first letter as follows February the second 1895 I venture to send you the following story I have lately heard from an eyewitness and to ask whether you or any of your readers can throw any light upon the dog's probable object. The dog in question was a scotch terrier. He was one day observed to appear from a corner of the garden, carrying in his mouth, very gently and tenderly, a live frog. He proceeded to lay the frog down upon a flower bed, and at once began to dig a hole in the earth, keeping one eye upon the frog to say that it did not escape if it went more than a few feet from him effectively back and then continued his work. Having dug the hole a certain depth, he then laid the frog still alive at the bottom of it, and probably scratched the loser back into the hole, and friend Froggy was buried alive. The dog then went off to the corner of the garden, and returned with another frog, which he treated in the same way. This occurred on more than one occasion. In fact, as often as he could find frogs, he occupied himself in burying them alive. Now, dogs generally have some reasons for what they do. What can have been a dog's reason for burying frogs alive. It does not appear that he ever dug them up again, to provide himself with a meal. If you will, any of your readers can throw any light on this curious and for the frog's most uncomfortable behavior of my friends, scotch terrier. I should be very much obliged, signed our aqualand troit. A week later, on February the ninth 1895 comes the response. I think I can explain the puzzle of the scotch terrier and his internment of the frogs for the satisfaction of your correspondence. A friend of mine had once a retriever who was stung by a bee. And ever afterwards, when the dog found a bee near the ground, she stamped on it and then scraped Earth over it and buried it effectually presumably to put an end to the danger of further beestings. In like manner, another dog having bitten a toad showed every sign of having found the mouthful to the law. degre unpleasant, probably Mr. Ackland troit dog had in the same way, bitten a toad, and conceived Henceforth, that he rendered public service by putting every Toad like creature he saw carefully and gingerly out of harm's way, underground. From seize power, calm.

There you go, dogs and frogs, frogs buried alive and toads and bees. Good lord. My ascent into heaven was I'm sorry to say something of a disappointment. To begin with the angels who bore me aloft the way for mortal clay were a shabby bunch. their wings were threadbare and caked in dust. Their golden locks were greasy and unwashed, and as for their faces, has pockmarked as Stalin's and as charmless things got no better when after much path we eventually fetched up at the pearly gates. The Poles themselves were tarnished, and I suspected they had been eat from infected oysters, runs with the bivalve mollusk equivalent of humans, scruff yeller, they were stuck to the gates with some kind of heavenly gum or paste which had an unbearable stink and further discolored the pearls, whatever this stuff was a sort of sticky Ecto plasm lacked adhesive hat, but I'll begin that sentence again. Whatever this stuff was a sort of sticky ectoplasm it lacked adhesive heft for quite a few Poles were either loose or had fallen from the gates and we're scattered in the gutter. I have not expected gutters in heaven, nor drains nor sewers, which is I suppose, a mark of my naivety. I cannot bring myself to go into detail about St. Peter. Suffice to say that his resemblance to starlin was Starker than that of the angels. The appraisal interview in which my time on Earth was picked over in forensic detail was a sore trial unto me, not because I had wallowed in moral squalor, but rather because it acted as a reminder of the tedium and waste and sheer futility of my life. Also, I was kept standing throughout, when all I wanted was to rest my weary bones. My weary dead bones, remember, sprawled on a sofa or a divan. And not only was I kept standing that kept standing in a puddle, because the nearest drain was blocked, clogged up with heaven. Mk. long lost Starling. Sorry, Peter waved me through the gates. I thought I would be escorted by the tatty angels, or at least one of them, but they were sent back down to the terrestrial plane to gather up another poor dead sword. So all alone, I stumbled into the light. The cloudy clumps beneath my feet were treacherous. It was like walking through a marsh where all the water turned to gas. Here and there, I spotted harps abandoned, rust covered and with broken strings. Clearly they haven't been played in living memory. But I realized, of course, there could be no such thing as living memory here in heaven, where we were all dead. At least I was. I couldn't see another soul in the entire expanse of misty light which stretched as far as I could see. Hey, whoa, I picked a cloudy clump at random and lay down upon it and I waited for trumpets and hosannas. Then it started to rain. 25 billion years later, fully rested. I sat up and peered into the mist. The torrential rain had slowed to a drizzle. Off in the distance, I saw a wall had been erected. I healed myself to my feet and squished through the Milky clumps towards it. As I approached, an angel of the Lord appeared carrying a stepladder and a bucket of gum or paste and a brush and a large roll of paper. I watched the angel erect the stepladder. clamber up it and spread paste upon the wall and unroll a paper and stick it up and brush it smooth and descend the stepladder and pick it up and carry it and the bucket and the brush away, vanishing into the mist. When I got closer, I saw it was a gigantic poster of Stalin, not some Peter, but Stalin himself. Under his grim yet avuncular countenance, there was a slogan. Unfortunately, I can't read Russian.

Frank Key  25:34
I felt sure the words were egging me on in the valiant struggle for a utopian workers future paradise with tractors on electrification and rallies. I struck a determined pose, staring forward, pointing at nothing, for there was nothing just the poster on the wall, and the endless expanse of white, Misty, milky light in heaven.

Frank Key  26:17
And that, my friends is the end of hooting out on the air for this week, and I shall return next week with more twaddle from the hooting yard twaddle hub. Bye bye
