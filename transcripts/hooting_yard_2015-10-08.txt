Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. resonance might be the only radio station and where you're likely to hear a variation on a theme by Alfred Lord Tennyson. That's what I'm going to read here today. I should point out that this the first part of this is a dialogue between two characters, one of them is female. But of course, I can only do my voice I can't I'm not really good at doing different voices. So context will have to be your guide as to who is speaking, and I will leave kind of significant pauses come into the garden mod. Not on your Nelly, you know only too well that I am a neurasthenic recluse and I prefer to remain in my bungalow with the window shattered. Sitting up to my escrow suar, penning tear stained versus when I have finished a particularly mawkish poem, I am given to flinging myself onto the floor, and having a fit of the Vipers screaming and drumming my heels on the linoleum and beating my white fists upon the wainscot, until they are bloody and bruised and require bandaging by Baines, my slovenly yet devoted maid servant. Why on earth Should I risk my fragile mental equilibrium by coming into the garden? Oh, come on, the black bat night has flown. I am reassured to learn that the garden is innocent of bat, which do swoop and squeak but there is much else out there guaranteed to send my weakling constitution into panic stricken trembling, those plants for example, I grant you they are gorgeous, but their gorgeousness seems fierce, passionate, and even unnatural. There is hardly an individual shrub which a wanderer straying by himself through a forest would not be startled to find growing wild, as if an unearthly face had glared at him out of the ticket. Several also would shock a delicate instinct such as mine, to pluck a delicate instinct at random by an appearance of artificial pneus, indicating that there had been such a co mixture, and as it were adultery of various vegetable species, that the production was no longer of God's making. But the monstrous offspring of man's deprived fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery of beauty. They are probably the result of experiment, which in one or two cases, has succeeded in mingling plants individually lovely into a compound possessing the questionable and ominous character that distinguishes the whole growth of the garden. It would not surprise me to learn that every single plant is a poisonous plant, as in the garden of Dr. Rocca KEANEY in one of the mosses from an old man's by Nathaniel Hawthorne. And it is into the midst of this toxic organic miasma that you would wish me to come skipping. without a care in the world. You must be insane. mode. All I'm saying is that the bat has flown away from the garden for the time being, and I want you to take advantage of its absence to come for a stroll, come nightfall, it will be back. You wish me to stroll with you in the garden, but you make no provision to protect me against being pricked by poisonous nettles or pointy thorns? It seems to me I would be far better off slumped on a shave along my limbs hanging limp, teeming with Whoa, and summoning Baines to fetch me and invigorating to sane. Well, I thought a stroll followed by a chase yet tingling in Bryce in a verdant Arbor might be a welcome diversion from your long silent empty days. I'm here at the gate alone.

Frank Key  05:10
It has not escaped my notice that you neglect to address my point about protective clothing, a point I feel quite justified in making an account of those monstrous, experimental plant with which the garden is rife prone to hysteria I may be and I do not dispute the fact. But I can still exercise my lady brain to deduce logical conclusions. And in this case, I suspect the stroll is less important to you than the embrace in the arbor and embrace for which you are reluctant to have me encumbered by for example, a beekeepers suit. There are no bees in the garden mode. Perhaps not. But as I have already made crystal clear, the gloves and hooded suit and hat and veil of the standard beekeeping suit would afford me protection against the perils of poisonous spiny vegetation. It is true that with me that in garbed, you may find any embrace, we recklessly throw ourselves into a measure less tingling than you desire, but I would have you recall that Sylvia Plath kept bees, and I'm sure her embraces with Ted Hughes, we're never less than tarried It sounds to me as if you might after all be considering coming into the garden mode, if I make all the necessary preparations do not get ahead of yourself sir. Thus far, we have merely addressed the issue of appropriate apparel. If I am not to be reduced to a quivering, quaking, screaming do Lally flibbertigibbet, there is much else to be discussed, negotiated and decided and plans set a foot to meet my conditions in full. You tell me that the black bat of the garden has flown. But how can I be sure you were not just trying to pull the wool over my eyes in your eagerness to stroll and embrace, albeit chastely but with tingling in a verdant Arbor, the bat might already have come back and be hiding somewhere concealed behind a frond ready to flatter fourth, and come swooping and squeaking and get itself entangled in my flat flowing pre-raphaelite tresses a circumstance that would inevitably lead to my being undone by palpitations and convulsions, leading to insensibility and possibly coma. Baines would have to run run like the wind to the grim, bleak asylum on the hill to collect the necessary paperwork to have me admitted they're in and I fear she is no longer capable of running, being aged and infirm herself, as well as slovenly and devoted Oh, come on mod just come into the garden for Christ's sake. blasphemy will get you nowhere. In fact, now my girlie is has been assailed by the sound of the Lord's name taken in vain. I must retire to my inner sanctum armed with a copy of the Book of Common Prayer, and I shall do my devotions, with the last reserves of energy I possess, before crumpling to the floor in a pitiable heap of exhaustion a neurasthenia. A pox on your garden, sir. Well, if that's your final word mod, I think I will instead go for a spin on my pennyfarthing out on the mod in fog and mist there to be set upon by werewolves as you wish. Toodle Pip.

Frank Key  09:29
I'm sorry that happened. That mod, having resisted the blandishments of the CAD, whose dearest wish was to coax her into the garden, repaired, not to her inner sanctum to do her devotions. But to her sitting room, where she collapsed on a sofa and rang the bell to summon Banes per slovenly yet devoted man made servant. The bail in the scullery was cracked and it clunked rather than rang but it has The desired effect and Banes went staggering along the bungalow corridor to her mistress, leaving smudges on the wall where she stopped to lean against it to catch her breath every few paces. Shall I be getting mad at her invigorating to sane, asked Banes. When eventually she toppled into the sitting room. You may rise Baynes said mod, mistaking her maid servants sprawling upon the carpet as a posture of subservience, rather than exhaustion, adding, and no, I have decided instead, to take a goodly draft of laudanum, be so good as to fetch it. fetched it was eventually and more knocked it back and fell into a welcome stupor, during which she dreamed, vivid, unsettling and visionary dreams, so vivid and unsettling and visionary, that as soon as she awoke from her opium days, she dragged herself to escrow tois to record them for posterity, and literature and immortality. But hardly Henry picked up her bio, then he was interrupted by an urgent hammering at the door. Listeners alert to anachronism well have splattered that mention of a by road. Surely they will ejaculate a Victorian hysteric could not wheeled by row to write down her effusions. However, mods bio was not the bio invented by the Hungarian ballpoint pen inventor Laszlo biro, but a writing instrument of her own devising more akin to a steel nib fountain pen, which she dubbed a by row, on account of a suggestive voice in her head, which had spoken to her in a vivid and unsettling and visionary dream during an earlier opium days. The wondrous sights and sounds vouchsafed to her in the present dream, which she was going to write down will last forever drew to the hammering her door. When later she returned to her escrow trois she found to her no small surprise and mortification that though she still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or 10, scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away, like the images on the surface of a stream, and to witness stone has been cast. But, alas, without the after restoration of the latter. The slovenly yet devoted Banes having glugged twice as much laudanum as her mistress with slumped insensible against the winds caught in a corner of the sitting room. So Maude went to answer the hammering the door herself. She opened it to reveal a man, he was of medium height, thin and the salvo with gray whiskers, thick gray hair, bushy eyebrows, and small pointed and inquiring features which gave him rather the aspect of a prying bird. His eyes were little and sparkling his mouth, strangely enough, was ecclesiastical. He was clad in very light colored clothes, yellow gray tweed, a yellow silk necktie, and a fawn colored Homburg hat and no human being had ever encountered him in a pair of boots unprotected by Spats. He was strikingly similar to the dweller on the threshold in the story by Robert smite, Hitchens. You Good day, madam. He said. The more familiar to ask Hello, having not yet been introduced by Thomas Edison as a common greeting. I am a person from porlock Come on business.

Frank Key  14:29
Where is porlock? And what is your business? asked Maude, who did not mince words with persons she's supposed to be in trade. Poor lockers or coastal village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated in a deep hollow below x more five miles west of Minehead, Madam, and my business is of a delicate nature, the likes of which I would beg to suggest is better disposed of indoors. My Autumn in. mod was rather startled, but she did not forget the social niceties and instructed the person from poor luck to walk through the ground to the rear of the bungalow, where he would find the tradesmen entrance. He was not actually in trade, but the very thought of engaging in a discussion, which might become an argument with a Victorian lady on her doorstep cost him Sacra mortification of the bowels that he immediately adopted Homburg and went off as he was bitten. mod, meanwhile, slammed the door shut, and returned in haste to the sitting room to rouse Baines. Baines had the only key to the tradesmen and entrance and had naturally never divulged a mod where it was kept. It was while she was pouring a bucket of cold water over the prostrate form of her maid servant. But the last remembered fragments of her dream vision fled from molds brain, and her chance of literary immortality was forever lost. Some hours having passed, the person from poor luck was admitted to the parlor, where he laid his cards on the table. They were tarot cards. What devilry is this? ex postulated mod, who was a devout Anglican. I did say it was a delicate matter, madam set a visitor, and he removed his Homburg to reveal that his scalp was shaved bear and upon the flesh in vivid colors, was tattooed the number 666. And was there a hint of the horns of a goat?

Frank Key  17:44
Previously on mod, having refused to go into the garden with a CAD mod has taken a draft of laudanum on waiting, she's disturbed by a knocking at her door. The visitor is a person from poor luck, come on business. Good heavens, by the evidence of the number 666 tattooed on your scalp, and that hint of horns, one might think you are the very devil himself, come from hell by way of porlock are you indeed Beelzebub? And if so, what do you want with me? I compliment you on your perspicacity, madam. Or do I mean perspicuity whichever it might be, I am as you would judge the devil incarnate. But if you do not think it, unforgivably ill mannered I shall put my humbug back on my head. So where you will not be unduly distracted by by those demonic signs or top of my cranium. We shall be better able to conduct our business. If you are not goggling why died all the while above my eyeline the many and various manuals of etiquette weighing down my bookshelves, of some of which I am myself the authoress are unanimous in declaring that it is most improper for a gentleman to wear a hat indoors, especially in the presence of a lady. How so that may be, you can hardly be regarded as a gentleman in light of your admission that you hail from the infernal realm of darkness. Do please put your hat back on. I would ring for tea and cucumber sandwiches were not that my slovenly yet devoted maid servant Baynes is collapsed insensible against the wind Scott in my sitting room, having taken an unconscionable dosage of laudanum earlier. I would hope that she will be up and about within the hour if you have patience. It might surprise you just how patient I can be madam. millenia have passed since this our present appointment was inscribed in my daybook by my recording demon occurs to me, sir, that had I succumb to the blandishments of the cat and gone with him into the garden, there to stroll and engage in a case yet tingling embrace in a verdant Arbor, you would have come knocking at my door in vain. Had I been in the garden? I would not have heard your rata Tad about Baynes. You know, there is no data lesson to me there, but one which I fear it is too late for me to digest. You will assert I suppose, that once our encounter was written down in your daybook, or appointments diary, whether yesterday or millenia ago, it was fated to happen, or no imaginable circumstance could have prevented it. Certainly not a kads blandishments. That is correct, madam. I find myself frantic with irritation, then, that my resistance to the CAD was not of my own making, not an inner strength, belying my status as a fragile and neurasthenic specimen of the weaker sex, but merely the playing out of cosmic forces quite beyond my control. I ought to clarify that my irritation is with myself, not with you, have you? I am rightly terrified, and I wait with tremulous palpitations to learn what business brings you here. All in good time, madam. porlock is a goodly distance from your bungalow. And though I be the devil I am yet prey to the aches and pains brought on by an arduous hike across the windswept More's The Promised refreshments of tea and cucumber sandwiches will thus be more than welcome, when Banes awake from her days. Hark, I hear clattering and groaning wick if my ears do not deceive me, or the sounds of Bain's, regaining consciousness, I shall go at once to give her instructions. Wait there, sir. In the temporary absence of the lady of the house, or rather bungalow, I'm used to myself allowed. Why I wonder, did tree not ring for her maid servant

Frank Key  22:45
using the broken and clunking yet effective Bell installed for that purpose? It is true, she may have lost her wits in my foul and damageable presence most people do. But it seems passing strange that she should lose her wits so irrevocably that she neglects or forgets the manners and morals of civilized society, and in going to her maid servant, rather than the other way about risks bringing the social order crashing to the ground. eek. Well, might you say eek, Beelzebub, your confidence in your own demonic power is severely misplaced. As you are now all too well aware, I have not lost my wit. If anything by a heightened loss it was that I was able to devise the stratagem of leaving the room to fetch Baines, when instead, I fetched these heavy iron trains, and crept in through a different door behind you. It was the work of a moment to bind you helplessly in the chains. Using the element of surprise. There will be neither tea nor cucumber sandwiches for you. When Baines wakes, the two of us together will drag you down into the cellar, where you will languish in the darkness nibbled by rats. Until such time as I decide what to do with you. I may hand you over to the CAD for sport, or perhaps Banes will wish to have you help out in the kitchen as a Skippy we shall see. For the time being. I shall take your unholy pack of tarot cards and stuffed them into your mouth, depriving you of the ability to other fiendish spells and Abracadabra, which might loosen the trains that bind you. I must say you have inadvertently provided the most amusing diversion in my otherwise tedious and uneventful day. But madam I implore you gap

So those were the first three episodes have come into the garden mod, or variation on a theme by Alfred Tennyson. And if you're lucky next week, I'll read you episodes four, five and six. We'll see how we get on. And now you'll remember that you will remember that last week I announced that my, my new book Mr. Key shorter, potted brief, brief lives had been published by constable. And I've been reading little bits of it to you over the past few weeks. So, to end this week show just a few more extracts. I think we're up to the letter E if I'm right. So we'll have a few. A few excerpts from shorter potty, brief, brief lives. This is Gil Edwards, an American writer of the 20th century. In her 1950 book, personality pointers, drill, Edwards listed some of the questions one should ask oneself each day. Do I know what my colors are? Do I make my vows sing? Am I direct, sincere and simple? Do I know the proper way to sit in and rise from a chair? Am I lovable? Am I original? Am I valiant? Have I made illegal will? Do I know where it is? Do I hang up my clothes as soon as I take them off? Do I so a snap fastener onto each end of a piece of tape about an inch and a half long. And so these tapes in the center of all shoulder seams, am I so poised so on my center so innately joyous, that life cannot sway me this way or that? Well, I don't know about you. But I asked myself those questions every morning without fail, and again in the evening. And I hope the answers are the same both times. Just two more very brief lives. All right Juliet, English occultist of the 20th century, Eliot made a long careful study of snake. He concluded that all of them were very stupid animals. And finally this week, Brian Peter George sindarin the Baptist delassalle ino, otherwise known as Brian ino, born 1948. In the 1970s, ino and his cat, Eric appeared in adverts for Purina cat food. And that's the end of this week's show. Bye bye.
