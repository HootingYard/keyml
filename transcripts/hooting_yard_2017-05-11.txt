His back was 60 unassailable facts about birds. All absolutely true. And his son some something from the life of Dobson remind me Dobson said marigold to one morning over breakfast. Did you ever write that pamphlet? Do you plan about the bandicoot the out of print pamphleteer was fumbling with his fork, trying to spear on its tines, one of the shriveled boiled otter heads swimming in a broth of gummy Pat with doc weed in his breakfast bowl. So terrific was his concentration that he barely heard his in Marotta, and he repeated the question after taking a swig of new breakfast varieties sculpt Joe from her tumbler. Dobson threw in the towel put down his fork and reached for a stick of celery style impacted vegetable matter. waving it in a shower flamboyance he announced, I will never write another word about birds. This exchange took place during the closing stages of the Battle of again pn foods. So with hindsight, were able to note the Dobson statement was ludicrously inaccurate. I do adore your non sequiturs. Dobson said marigold too. But do tell I'm agog to know about the bandicoot pamphlet his mouth full of curiously tasteless vegetable matter. Dobson gazed at his enamorado as if she had taken leave of her senses, his table manners being impeccable, he did not attempt an immediate reply marigold to waited upon his munching. She herself was a dab hand with the fork and the auto heads and had finished her breakfast some minutes earlier. Your remark regarding non sequiturs seems to me a non sequitur, in and of itself, said Dobson. Eventually, then his voice rising, shouted, be that as it may, when I say I shall never again write a single word on the subject of birds, I mean it and now I am going to go out in the rain for no apparent purpose. I can think of a purpose Dobson said marigold to wild are out in this apocalyptic downpour. Perhaps you could stop by the kiosk in the shadow of the viaduct, I pick up a copy of the daily digest of the doings of small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores for me. As he struggled to dawn his Eritrean artificial goat wizards boots with exceedingly complicated lighting protocol, the pamphleteer said, you don't normally take that publication. Is there any reason for the sudden interest? I think there might be something in it that I want to show you Dobson she said an enigmatic smile on her lips. stamping his feet to finally lodged them firmly into his boots. Dobson took his hat and coat and crashed out of the door into the rain. He wondered why on earth marigold thought he might be interested in small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores when his head was filled with unrelated matters, including Hungarian football ice fairing, push gas plinky plunky, piano music, weird sausages, asteroid belt and plums. And one thing I am most definitely not interested in. He shouted at a SWAT as he passed the pond is birds, any birds, all birds, and that includes you Swan and your pounds the tail and the mergansers and buffleheads and kuten bandicoots. Later, sopping wet. Dobson arrived home with a copy of the daily digest of the doings of small to medium sized terrestrial marsupial omnivores. Which the kiosk guest had very thought Fully plopped into a waterproof bag for him as a small extra charge. Here is your magazine, he said, tossing it onto the table as a puddle formed around his feet. marigold crew took the magazine from the bag lift through it, and alighted on a short an interesting article illustrated with several black and white snapshot taken by Tip Top marsupial snapper, Rex soufeel on the subject of the bandicoot when you have a moment, Dobson cheated. You might want to take a look at this I shall make a pot of tea and shortly afterwards, the out of print pamphleteer learned taze hora,

that everything he had intended to say about bandicoots in his projected pamphlet, hundreds of pages of scribbled notes and droppings and Ill turned sentences of foolish conjecture was dust was as dust and ashes.

In ghouls, he shook panting there was a crocus in his buttonhole. It was wilted now, the morning was a damp one, and he had no hat for it and snagged on a thorn bush a mile back, and in his Hurry, he could not stop to retrieve it. Like King James the first, his tongue was overlarge for the mouth that contained it, and he was forever slobbering overhead, the flak from fighter jets drowned out birdsong. As it was, he could never tell the call of one bird from another, his his simply did not have the ability to distinguish. Often as now he thought of the custards of his childhood suffers thoughts that made him slobber all the more shaking in the golf, hatless an ignorant he came of good family ruined by speculation. grumble is all moaning at their misfortune. But he did not moan. He had a different bent. I shall follow my own star he had said almost his first words, rendered barely intelligible by that too big tongue. Follow it he did, even when it was invisible in the morning mist. Shaking in the goals, he scan the sky for portance but could see ot but the blur of milky half light. He struck a Mac and set fire to a flare up it went fizzing Orangery. Like came for him before noon. The mist of dispersed and the fighter jets had long past birdsong could be heard again. They interrogated him about his hat. There was no question but that he must retrace his steps as far as the thornbush, hatless his petition would never be heard. He stumbled back the way he had come before dawn. Everything looked so different in the blaze of noon, so different that soon he was lost, so lost, and instead of the thorn bush, he came upon a blue and splendid like, upon which thousands of swans were arrayed, or gazing directly at him. He slumped to the ground and took from his pocket of Brazil that, would he pop it into his mouth or plop it into the mic? What would you have done in his place? Your answer should be roughly 200 words in length on one side of a sheet of paper.

So you can write your write your 200 words on whether you put the pebble in your mouth or into the pond. And you don't need to write it on paper. You can you can email it to me, send me an email viably. And if you want the address, go to the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org where you can find all sorts of stuff To read and look at, and things to buy, and donations to give an online kind of thing is a very good website even though it hasn't been updated for about six weeks, but I will probably explain that in the near future. pebble heads book of British pebbles is something of a departure for the best selling paperback pot boiler list. Best known phase fat airport bookstore, but best known for his fat airport bookstore blockbusters, with one word titles ending in an exclamation mark. His latest tome is a picture book featuring hundreds and hundreds of snaps of pebbles, accompanied by sprightly and vivid explanatory texts. For many years, I have been collecting pebbles, said pebble head, sheltering from the rain under an umbrella outside a sordid backstreet bordello, where he was buttonhole by an eager young cub reporter from a regional newspaper. And it occurred to me to exploit my success as a writer of potboilers to bring the joy of pebbles to a wider audience. Pebbles are too often ignored and neglected in this day and age. I want people to notice them, admire them, pick them up and plop them in their pockets and take them home. then place them on their mantle piece or window sill and give them a good Polish with a rag at a spray can of Mr. brightly, dazzling, proprietary pebble Polish from time to time. They're also very useful for tracking swans if you have a fit of pique when taking a turd around your local duck pond. And with that, the indefatigable paperback just clamped his pipe tighter between these drawers and flounced off in the rain towards some fresh hell.

The wool for this cardigan was spun by cretins among Kearns and hubub at a rebel in a bomb. It has been described as a cardigan factoring and calmly and Stalinist though also, it's fair to admit as unprepossessing it may be pertinent, but the person who considered it an unprepossessing cardigan is a wall ignorant knave from a rival village, but it is a view and therefore be registered in the cardigan book. The wax seal on the front of the cardigan book is stamped with an image of a sheep. It is more accurate to call it a wax blob, for it does not act as a seal. It is purely decorative, and was added to the cover by the village waxer. To give the book he said an antique air. We have only been keeping the cardigan book for the past two weeks. All villages are required to inform the village card agonist of the views expressed upon their cardigans. Whether the views be those of their fellow villagers or of strangers, such as the wall ignorance knave from arrival village. It should be noted that his own village has no cardigan book to speak of. Initially, we kept the book in an ante room of 40 but we have since moved it to a locked chamber in the Tower of Fort toity. The door to the staircase of the tower is guarded by a pair of trained yet savage swarms. Their honks when alarmed, can be heard for miles, even in the rival village, from whence the wall ignorant knave came lumbering across the field. There were many sheep in the field, so many sheep they cannot be counted. There, Shawn the now and the cretins in the barn spin their fleeces into wall for the knitting of various hubbub in the bargain among the trends for the rebel goes on. It goes on and on and on, and will go on until all the revelers drop exhausted on the sawdust, then still, the cretins will spin, they will spin and spin and spin until all the wall has been made into cardigans, and the views of each and all on each and every cardigan. entered in the cardigan book. Oh how hopeless it Obviously, we cannot see straight. We put our blinkers on wait for the rain.

Finally this week a little song. janitor janitor. Where is your mop? janitor janitor. Where is your mop? janitor janitor. Where is your mop? For Christ's sake? Let the question drop. janitor janitor. Where is your pile? You have no pile or do you have no mop? You have no bucket. You have no keys. Oh please please let this matter drop. These are the first two verses of janitor janitor, one of the songs collected in the new Compendium 444 songs about janitors and janissaries. Edited by Dennis bear pond. It is a work of majestic scholarship and beer pint is to be congratulated for the depth of his scholarship, the rigor of his method, the pen nicotinate as his annotations, the suavity of his commentary, the glamour of his buffo the shmaltz of his winged piperine the electrocution of his swamp, the gathering of his rain pie, the redundancy of his courage, the consistency of his porridge, and the test of his skills. What he is most certainly not to be congratulated for is that creaking, malignant, awful, dehydrated, bony bony trapeze artist air he simultaneously exudes and muscles and muscles and exude all spat out fruit pips and prisoner's dilemma, a mole in the headlights of a tractor, a tractor in a field, a field in Mary England, where rustics covered around a maple before slumping exhausted onto bales of hay and straw, picking gauze and bracket out of their hair, while in the blue skies above the renewables loop like so many gas filled balloons above the verdant splendor. It is a verdant splendor, many of the janitors in this magnificent anthology would do well to revisit, could they but drag themselves away for five minutes from their interminable corridors punctuated by cupboards, where keys are rattled, or buckets and pails, and mops, and mislaid. And those are terrible weeping in the dark hours before the dawn.
