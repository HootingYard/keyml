Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is the show now known as a general air of decrepitude, or it used to be called printing out on the air. may one day again be called that. So I'm going to read for about 28 and a half minutes over there about and if I can pay through my extremely powerful magnifying glasses. Here's the story. I am the hermit of the dingley Dell, God. It is the dingiest of Dells. That is why I chose it for my hermitage. It's glades and dingles are abundant with those things which provide for a hermit simple needs, such as nuts and fruit, and reels of fresh water. Every now and then, in a real a fish mites win by deploying my net worth practice skill. I catch the fish. Then I will sit before a fire toasting the fish upon a fork, my hand appraised to sweet and son, my shoes doffed to oblivion, like the hermit in the song by the art bears himself inspired by the hermit carved in stone on the stylobate of the cathedral in Amiel. I have considered carving myself in stone to pass the time in the dingley Bell, but I do not have the proper tools. I suppose I could. Rob and Robert a pebble every day persistently and carefully for years, but even then it would be very difficult to get the proper finish. Still, it's a project I may yet embark upon further days and nights along in the dingley Dell. And once I have gathered my nuts and fruits of a morning, and made a note of the reading on the rain gauge, hanging from a branch of the mighty laburnum. I must always be on my guard against the devil, who we know makes work for idle hands. The devil has appeared to me in many guises since I came to mind permitted in the dingley Dell. First he took the form of a vaporous mist. This suggested to me that his powers were weak, and I laughed at him, loudly waving my arms about to disperse him. But then he grew able to inhabit solid forms, or be tiny ones, such as an ant or a twig. Likely things have entered a dangerous phase for the devil has entered the body of a squirrel and the dingley Dell is teeming with squirrels, shunning the company of my kind as I do, being a hermit. I have learned to commune with squirrels, but now I must shun them to or risk engaging with Beelzebub himself. Well, that to happen I might be forced to take refuge in the dingley Dell hotel. In the normal run of things of course, I avoided sometimes while gathering my nuts and fruits, I come close to the hotel carpark and hide behind the shrub. I've seen the major Domino of the hotel striding purposefully across the carpark even making his way into the dingley Dell itself, where he stops and sits on our log and smokes a cigarette. This is disturbing, but I am not so neurotic as to think he is in league with the devil. Even though squirrels do approach him tentatively hoping perhaps for a night or two.

Frank Key  04:29
But the major Damo is not a man for naps. He just smokes his cigarettes, and occasionally taps out messages on a Blackberry. Not the kind of blackberry I would have for my supper. After some toasted fish I should add. His is an electronic device, which beeps from time to time while he smokes. It is most irritating, but I dare not rush out at him from behind my shrub and snatch the thing from his hands and stamp upon it. until it is crushed to smithereens, which is what I would like to do. For if I did that, I could betray my presence in the dingley Dell and it would no longer be my hermitage. I would probably have to talk to the major Damo to explain myself, and I'm not sure I can remember how to speak in a way that is understood. Unless I'm speaking to squirrels. And until the devil shifts shape, I cannot even talk to the squirrels. What is to become of me here in the dingley Dell, I shall make a note of the registration plates of the cars in the hotel carpark and compare the numbers with the readings from the rain gauge to discover if there is any conclusion correlation that will pass the time and be more diverting them going Rob Rob Robert a pebble and eventually the devil will tire of being a squirrel and turn into something else. He will never out with me, for I am the hermit of the dingley Dell buster.

Some years ago, were one strolling in a marina or a harbor, it would be quite common to hear a bunch of tinies chanting a rhyme, as they danced hand in hand in a ring around a collapsed and comatose seaside salt. Sea the drunken yachtsman vomit on his blazer, it is mine near botsman that pin with your taser, I'm gonna sing that again. See the drunken yachtsman vomit on his blazer, it is mine here blockman zappin with your taser. There are several problems with this and we're indebted to our todo himmelfarb Bob, the noted collector of children's gruesome seaside songs, who recently published a research paper in which he tabulates the complexities on an abstract graph with pointy bits and no doubt expensive for color printing. As if the way with good old Arturo, a draconian embargo has been placed on the graph, so I cannot reproduce it here anyway, but on the radio, instead, I will do my best to summarize the points he makes using plain words, rather than exciting graphic hullabaloo. First, botsman is given the Dutch honorific mind here, in spite of the fact that all the available evidence suggests he was Swiss, though there have been arguments of deathly tedium, questioning his nationality nobody has ever claimed botsman with a NATO commander, or even a Belgium as for the so called Africana cradle in the nursery conjecture, that nonsense was comprehensively demolished Long, long ago, by yours truly on primetime television, no less, thanks to the good offices of Russell hearty plus. Secondly, botsman was famously teetotal, and never allowed a drop of spirits as Rebecca passes a bit, the idea that he would be found lying, ruined by drink at a marina is laughable. It is true, he was fond of the sea, which he memorably described as that soaking wet immensity stretching to the horizon and beyond, and often sculpt about ports and harbors and key sides and marinas, doing his block many doings. But those doings were always done sober, have no doubt about that, too, which one might add, that his love of coastal purviews did not extend to the sea itself, for he was a boat scared man all his life that he would ever have gone yachting, it's inconceivable. In a different section of his fantastic graph, Arturo demonstrates, but at the time, the children's dizzy was recorded, the taser had not yet been invented. In those days if one wanted to fail a malefactor, one used a club or a bludgeon The taser itself in its initial form, dates from 1974. The year of POTUS Richard Nixon's disgrace and resignation. In any case, as the upper right segment of the graph demonstrates with admirable clarity, one needs neither taser nor club no bludgeoned to subdue assault in a coma, whose collapses due to his having drugged an unconscionable amount of heat. In some man the run makes no sense whatsoever. Hot brain Gallic post modernist Jacques postman has attempted to undo as he puts it, Arturo's tremendous diagram, but nobody takes him seriously anymore, Thank heaven, which just goes to show that the life can be sucked out of even the dirtiest children's child when the leeches of academe are properly applied.

Frank Key  11:15
If you're a certain type of folk singer or Vicar or countryside Rambler, you will as likely as not be wearing a jumper or sweater or pullover made of wool. It may conceivably be a polo neck you more than anyone will know that there is good warm and there is bad wall. I would go so far as to say that in the matter of wall, there is no middle ground, no gray area. Either the wall is good or it is bad and there is an end on if your jumper or sweater or pullover has been knitted from goodwill, you should count your blessings. Depending on where you live. Good rule can be hard to come by, you may have had to send away to some far distant bully apparel concern to have one of their catalog items delivered to you through the mails in a packet. The cost of transportation and packaging will have added to the basic price of your chosen jumper or sweater or pullover. But the outline is justified when it is guaranteed that the network was done with good wolf. But whoa betide you if for some reason, you were forced to wear something made from bad wall. Bad wall comes from bad sheep buy might be deceased. They might be diseased or repugnant or unseemly all three that does not stop unscrupulous sharers from sharing the wool from them and selling it onto equally unscrupulous merchants, who in turn have it processed and knitted into garment. It is both sad and astounding. What reserves of human skill can be deployed into making something out of bad worn spotting a garment on a market stall or for sale from the Barrow of a Barrow boy, it may not be immediately apparent whether the wall is good or bad wall. It might not even become evident when you put it on pulling over your head and inserting your arms and tucking it about yourself. But is made from bad wall it will contaminate you as surely as night follows day. That is the thing about garb knitted from bad wall. The knitting was bad and the garbage is bad because of the bad wall and disporting it upon your frame sashaying along the boulevards of your faubourg it will make you bad too. It is a wonder that bad wall has not been made illegal. Perhaps there are happy lands where that is the case. Is that not a pleasing thought? A happy land where all the wall is good and none of it bad? Alas, it is an impossible dream, for there will always be bad sheep and bad sharers and unscrupulous merchants and ne'er do well traders and Barrow boys. Hence, if you're wearing good wool, I repeat, Count your blessings. Count them until Kingdom Come and then count them over again. And if you're wearing bad wall, reflect upon the circumstance, ask what you have done to deserve bad wall. It is likely that you broke But Bad Wolf upon yourself through your own contamination, for bad attract bad in persons and wall as in other phenomena of the boundless universe.

Frank Key  15:31
Speaking of wall, good and bad wall to adjust wall, I'm gonna hand over briefly to our hooting admitting correspondent, pansy cradle Drew, who's going to talk to you about science. Excuse me, who's going to talk to you about science?

Unknown Speaker  15:52
I am going to talk to you about science. In fact, it's further science. Our friend Norman Davies. And let's start with short, sweet, simple, profound, one God concept. One, that although God is not many, yet God is not one either. Two, for the concept, one implies other. Three. Therefore, God is not one, but just is for IE is infinite and comprehensive. Without the bounds of oneness.

Frank Key  19:48
be interesting to know what Norman Davis might have had to say about Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump but we will never know It's a simple enough matter to embed a drug. I'm gonna stop and then I'm going to start again. This is a simple enough matter to embed a galvanic battery in the graceful head of a swan provided that is your a boffin with some training in the basic techniques of veterinary surgery. the lay person or amateur is likely to face difficulties, not only with the bloody business of embedding, but also in telling the difference between a galvanic battery and other types of battery. And indeed, in knowing what a swan looks like. The owner for logic of ignorance of some people is breathtaking. The honest theological ignorance of some people is breathtaking, and that includes boffins. For example, I once met a boffin and acknowledged wizard at home in the lab, heating various substances in glass tubes over a Bunsen burner. Who mistook a Heron for a cassowary. If you can imagine such bird blindness, and do not get me started on the story of the boffin who pointed at a flock of swooping swift in the sky and said, Ah, I love the sight of whooping pratincole A boffin who has grasped the basics of veterinary surgery, however, should know the swarm when they see one, and depending on their field of buffing hood, ought to be able to pick a galvanic battery out of a lineup of various types of battery. There are cases where the name of the battery type is etched or stamped on the body of the battery itself, for ease of identification, and then no familiarity with batteries is required. However, it is rare or rare indeed, to find a bird so etched or stamped, one must learn at least a few basic identification skills to pick a swarm out of a lineup. But I will not give the impression that the putative embedder must first pick out a galvanic battery, and then select a swan from the pair of the lineup, like identity parades, such as are arranged by coppers following an arrest connected to a height. It is much more common to be cold and to perform the embedding and to find a galvanic battery and a swan already provided the one resting on a countertop and the other stand with anesthetic fast asleep in a basket. Even the most stupid person will know which is the battery and which is the bird, I hope and ally even the merest smidgen of doubt, some form of signage can be installed cheaply using a couple of sheets of cardboard, and a magic marker pen. To make absolutely sure the words galvanic battery and Swan on the signs can be accompanied by simple pictograms for the illiterate add to each sign and emboldened arrow pointing clearly towards water Beardy friends intellectual would call the read the sorry, add to each time an emboldened arrow pointing clearly towards what a beer the French intellectual would call the referent and Bob's your uncle. Now, I mentioned that the emboldening the I mentioned that the embedding is a bloody business. And so it is, there is no way of slicing an opening in the Grateful head of a swarm without causing a flow of hot hot red Swan dwar it is helpful to have a gaggle of eager unpaid interns to staunch this and to mop up inevitable spillages. So the embedder can get on with the task at hand, which is to embed the galvanic battery into the swans head by shoving it oh so delicately through the bloody slit until it's lodged firmly next to this one brain.

Frank Key  24:45
Note that the brain of a swan will always be located in its head, rather than elsewhere in its anatomy. That damn sub up the slit with butcher string and slap a bandage over it. If the bandages White is as is common and the swan is white as is common, the usual observe the casual observer may not even notice that the embedding has taken place. That may or may not be important, depending upon the legal regulations obtaining in the jurisdiction. Some authorities take a dim view of the embedding of galvanic batteries in the graceful heads of swans. By for the life of me, I cannot think why that might be so. In any case, it's better to check the legal position beforehand. Other listeners will have spotted that I omitted to mention perhaps the most crucial part of the process, which is the bit where the galvanic battery is actually attached to the brain of the swan by wires. In practice, of course, one would never miss this out. Otherwise, the entire operation would be a waste of time and effort. However, unlike the slicing and cutting and shove, shoving and storing and mopping up, the wiring is a bit fiddly and complicated, and matter fraught with god awful difficulties, deserves a separate article written in fiddly and complicated prose, to which the listener must pay unflinching attention, while also being wide awake, and probably half crazed with stimulants. That article has yet to be written, and it will need to be approved by experts in the fields of galvanic batteries, and of swans and of wiring before it can appear here for your instruction and edification.

Sweet rhubarb rhubarb is the fruit of barbarians, and we live in barbaric times. That is why you see so much rhubarb on people's plates these days. But as we know, rhubarb crumbles, so too will the barbarians crumble when we smite them. smile to your rhubarb before putting it upon your plate. smite it while it's still in its rhubarb bed, in a tent under arclight, where it grows, so I am told, smite this, smite the stalks before plucking them from their beds and carrying them in a sack back home, to be boiled and boiled and boiled to bush. It is food for barbarians. To be sure, eating without utensils shoved still hot into the mouth, with your bare hands gobbled down. You will burn your hands on the rhubarb Bush, but you are a barbarian. Burns and abrasions and cuts and wounds are mere marks of barbarity. But you too will be smitten as you smoked your stalks of rhubarb, like rhubarb, you will be pulverized to mush by fearsome foes even more barbaric than you. They are gathering now beyond the horizon, beyond the hills, over which they will come sweeping, shouting a great roar of yet base of barbarism. And look, they are armed with stalks hot dogs, they brandish in their hairy fists, stalks of raw rhubarb. They are so barbaric. They do not even know how to boil their fruit. I shall try them. And that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. Thanks to pansy cradle jus for reading to us from further science. 20 by Norman Davis. Thanks to john for Johnny seven for producing the show. And I won't be back next week because I have to go and have my eye injected again on Thursday. So I'll be back in two weeks. I'll say oh, wait to see you then because this is radio, but I will be aware of your presence and you have mine
