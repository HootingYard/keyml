Oh hello, and this is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank t. This is hooting out on the air. And something untoward has just happened with the NA NA. All right. And yes, so this is this is holding out on the air, in which I read to you for a bit. I would like to point out here that I burned today that I am the subject or half the subject of a doctoral dissertation. Currently a forthcoming doctoral dissertation being written by an academic who I am helping with her inquiries. And the title is, if memory serves playful poetics, comma, post modern politics kolam a reading in the selected works of Lewis Carroll and Frank key. So that will be interesting to read when eventually, I mean, probably being a doctoral dissertation, it will be years before it's completed. I'm a bit confused about the postmodern politics, but there you go, might be better. Maybe they're all in the Lewis Carroll section. I don't know. Anyway, and when I was about 11 years old, I devoted much of my time to Nesbitt spotting. For a child growing up on a featureless suburban Council of State, it was perhaps an unusual pastime, and more unusual still that so young, I was the editor of the Nisbet spotting society's official journal. A few words of explanation are in order. I was prompted by something to recall my guven nelia. written as I say, written when I was about 11 years old, and I put pen to paper. And when I did, it was to write illustrate and stapled together, the pages of volume one number one of the official journal of the Nisbet spotting society. Several further issues appeared over the next year or so, though the circulation never rose above one copy. In retrospect, I can see that the whole Nisbett spotting business was hooting yard in Ohio. It sprung fully formed into my juvenile head one day, I think, after I saw a photograph of a footballer in the newspaper, and it was one of those little just had head and shoulders shot with a very brief caption like Nisbett footballer or something. Anyway, this football was nice. I like to say Graham Nesbitt, but I'm not entirely sure. But something about this photograph, and just a nice bit underneath. I don't know what happened. But anyway, as I say, the whole idea of Nisbet spotting sprung fully formed into my head, and I set about chronicling it with a borrowed the basic idea was that there was a society devoted to this important activity, with its headquarters oddly in Biggleswade, ugly because I knew nothing of Biggleswade and I've never been there. Indeed, as far as I recall, I've still never been there. The name appealed to me as frankly comic. From the outset, I devoted to I sorry, from the outset, I devised to iron rules. First, I would never attempt to explain what a nice bit was. So it remained simply a word and nothing more. Had I been aware at the time of structuralism and post modernist theory, no doubt I would have heralded it as a signifier without a signified but we didn't use language like that in the London Borough of bars. In the 1970s

Frank Key  05:03
the second iron rule was that none of the members of the society would ever actually spotted this bit. I recall at one point, including a chart, listing the official spotting numbers in the interwar period, and glean from a writing nil against each year. I found it endlessly amusing to write putatively learned articles about in essence, nothing. readers and listeners familiar with my hooting yard work will immediately see the connection. Tragically, during my earnest and bewildered teenage years, I destroyed these youthful outpourings. Determined to be a proper writer, I typed away frantically on the family's Olivetti page off the page of awful twaddle. doubtless with a message for the world. It was not until my mid 20s that I got all that nonsense out of my system. I think I was 26 or 27 when I read the line by Dallas Wiebe, when you have nothing to say, you write prose, that was a thunderbolt and liberated me. I've consciously had nothing to say ever since, and have been saying or writing it for over three decades. But it all began with the futile and pointless activities of an imaginary group of hapless hobbyist, trying to spot a nice bit with insane persistence when I was 11.

Frank Key  07:07
Speaking of pointless and futile drivel, here's a fourth tale of don't plow. You heard three three of these tiles last week. Here's a fourth seems to be the shouting of the populace outside. Maybe they're waving pitchforks and about to attack resonance. Who knows? Nimrod image don't plow is an opera by horse gak. The contemporary composer famed for his startling boufal ill temper and near fatal coughing fit. It is both unfinished and unperformed. Several extracts have been recorded at gunpoint by the loopy runs through the jug band, accompanied by one time pop strolls, Ingmar and Hetty The so called terrifying singing twins, Horst gak himself pointed the gun. In act one scene one, Nimrod arrives in don't plow, the mighty hunter before the Lord is appropriately on a hunting expedition. He sings that he has heard much about the fabled chicken of don't plow, which he means to hunt down pinion and strangled with his bare hands. He is overheard by wouldn't be the don't play our postmistress who is hiding behind an heiress. When Nimrod exits, Schwinn B appears and sings the plaintive ballad must we swim yet again in the blood of kickings. Horse gang has yet to write scenes two and three. But in Act One, scene four, we find Nimrod alone in the graveyard of bibley their bibs church, leaning insouciantly against the tombstone, smoking a fag and muttering to himself, because the mattering is punctuated by occasional thumps of the kettle drum halls. gak counts this as an arietta. The only other scene of the opera yet completed is act seven scene 42 shrimpie is standing outside the bow chicken sanctuary, holding a placard and singing a dirge. Critics have been sharply divided over this lengthy number. in the medical field tomato sellers weekly. trilby Baxter dubbed it a dire dodge the diarrhea dirge I ever heard. This sentence was abstracted by Dennis Pierpont, who used it as the first line of one of his tweet verses were heard is rhymed with birds. Could furred bird again and ERD on the other hand, writing in the journal dogies by jack Giles PIP straw commanded the pieces, possibly the most magnificent dirge moaned by a postmistress holding a placard outside dubrow clicking sanctuary ever committed to sheet music by your friend and mine, Horst gak the overexcited pips draw added nine exclamation marks at the end of that sentence. Other critics have ignored the derge entirely waiting some would say wisely for the opera to be finished before they pronounce upon it. CDs of the recorded extract can be obtained at jumble sales, charity shops, and as part of the content of a jam burry bag available from spivs working in in salubrious alleyways in certain Elston seaside resorts, but not in don't brow. Ingmar and Hetty are currently on tour with their 80 years in showbiz and contemporary German opera special extravaganza,

a land remote and lovely when the first three things are likely to strike the visitor of butter and clutter and taxis. You will ask why those three things rather than say soap and water, crest and canals, or toffee and rainfall and pig iron. All I can say in return is that travelers to that land upon their return, eyes bright buttonhole, the stay at home, and babble excitedly about butter and clatter and taxis. Being unreasonably obsessed with the Kennedy assassination. I have just begun reading Stephen King's new pebble head like big, fat bestseller 1122 63 I do wish it had been renamed 22 1163 on our shores. The conceit of the book is that the narrator travels back in time to before that date, and attempts to prevent the killing of the POTUS. I mentioned this because one must travel through time in order to visit the land of butter and clatter and taxis. What is not clear to me is the direction of travel. Is this land plunged in the past? Or is it a future state? And how will I even know short of going there myself 11 to 1122 63 as in many another time travel narrative. The past is reached via a portal, in this case, the pantry of a diner. When I have questioned travelers returning from the remote and lovely land of butter and clutter and taxis. They invariably refused to divulge the location of the portal, or indeed, whether one needs to pass through a portal with a tool to get there. There are after all, other means, like the eponymous contraption in HG Wells is the time machine. But nobody is willing to tell me how I might get from here to there. Wherever there is. For the time being I remained stuck in the here and now. That's not such a bad thing. Of course. It's what I'm used to. Yeah, I cannot help hankering Oh, the butter the return visitors cry is golden. Oh, the clatter is curiously mellifluous. Oh, the taxis, how they career along even the wide important boulevards of that remote and lovely land. It is all a far cry from the margerine and Denon traffic congestion of my own time. is decidedly odd that the visitors are so keen to extol the virtues of that past or future land, yet remain so reticent about how they came and went on to now I come to think of it that the only virtues they extol are the butter and platter and taxis. I have asked him about Other features about soap and watercress and canals, and toffee and rainfall and pig iron among other things, but they purse their lips and look at me quizzically as if they have no idea what I'm talking about, Oh, forget about those things they say, let me tell you about the butter and the clatter and the taxis and they are off again, breathless with enthusiasm. I have poked and prodded about the city in search of a likely portal without quite knowing what I'm looking for. Quiet Stephen King. I haunt pantries, particularly, but not exclusively, those in diners and cafes and restaurants, cooks and chefs and maitre D's are none too pleased with me. And I'm often escorted off the premises in our roughly angry manner. pantry does not equal portal, of course, and I try other points of access, such as mysterious doorways and archways AND gates and wickets. Most of these have a mysterious character have more sorry more of these have a mysterious character than you might imagine. It's also occurred to me that perhaps I need to catch some sort of magic bus or coach, or strangely unscheduled train. And I've spent more hours than I care to count lolling about at bus stops and railway stations, trying to spot telltale signs ever in vain.

Frank Key  16:38
One day, my frustration at boiling point, I went out and bought a packet of butter, and I hailed a taxi and directed the driver to take me to somewhere I might hear a lot of clutter. He took me grindingly slowly through the congested streets to one lane alongside a railway shunting yard. The sound was more akin to din than mellifluous clatter, but he'd done his best and I gave him a generous tip. There was a low wall on the line bordering a flower bed violent with lupins and I sat upon it clutching the butter contented past the time. I suppose there was a nagging hope that a portal would open up before me or an emissary from that remote and lovely land suddenly materialized before me all spring out from behind the lupins and take my hand and guide me. But nothing whatsoever happened. Save that along the line came passing and off kruti maitre D, one who have expelled me from his pantry a few days before, and he recognized me and cursed me as he passed and threatened to call the police. Though I was doing nothing wrong. I made a gift to him of the packet of butter as a peace offering. And he relented and sat down on the wall next to me, and we fell into amicable conversation. Have you heard tell I asked a remote and lovely land in another time, whether past or future I do not know where the buzzer is golden and the clatter is mellifluous, and the taxis career along the wide important boulevards. Why, yes, he cried. Only the other evening in the restaurant, there was a group one of the tables who spoke of such things. Did you ask him Have I got there via a portal paps or by magic bus etc? I did not as make 3d I spoke to them only have food and drink and service standards. In any case, I did not need to ask for already. I already know the answer. It is around I have visited many times myself. In fact, I'm on my way there now. My eyes popped out of my head. Gosh, I said I knew I would be onto something by having a packet of butter and taking a taxi to a place of clutter. Can I come with you? Of course you cannot, he replied. And he stood up and turned about twice thrice and vanished behind the lupins I sprang after him and tripped over and lay sprawl when it's in the flowerbed with my mouth full of mud. And then a wind came in from the west, a roaring wind so loud that it drowned out the clatter from the shunting yard. I had given my bachelor away and the taxi was gone. I got up and dusted myself down and trudged home. The evening newspaper was on the doormat. A huge headline shriek the news that far away in Dallas, Texas, President Oswald had been short

Unknown Speaker  20:13
Continuing with our theme, an entry from Mr. Keys shorter potted brief, brief lives. Kennedy, john Fitzgerald, American politician and POTUS 1917 to 1963. On the private pier in Newport, Rhode Island in September 1963, Kennedy enacted a macabre death by assassination fantasy. He lay seemingly lifeless, spattered with tomato juice or ketchup, while his wife Jackie and a friend stepped gingerly over him. True story. Moving on to homerun john George, German American writer 16th century, human devised a method of angling guaranteed to catch fish, dangling net in a river or lake and fish will be sure to collect there. If you have first place to the net row seat, mustard seed and the foot of a weasel.

Frank Key  21:35
I don't know about you, but I always carry somewhere about my purse on the foot of a weasel, just in case I might need it. Here is tales of number five. immediately adjacent to the don't plow wall shop on the main shopping parade is the don't plow new Gar parlor. This is the chief source of new Gar or nugget, not only in good plow, but for miles around. The proprietor of the new gob Paula is a fellow called Yuka Pekka illegible who can best be described as a capsized man. That is how he was referred to in the most authoritative book on the subject, pen portraits of the proprietors of the dubrow new Gar parlor from its foundation in 1882. to the present day. The eligibility of his surname is but one telling sign of his capsized nature. Add to that the fact that he's often to be found upside down and soaking wet, even when behind the counter selling new Gar to the more confectionery bedazzled citizens don't plow. His history is curious if shadowy It is also dark, sweeping, flinty era strewn, piquant load bearing, toffee nosed Hip, hip and hapless. Some claim it is tacky. Whichever word to use to describe his history, they pale in comparison to the pencil drawings and diagrams, which often accompany them. many if not most of these were executed at a single marathon session by don't browse civic pencil East Maisie bins Maisie bins herself is a woman without a history. One day she was just there reported the town blabber now, sitting on a chair near the shopping parade scribbling in her sketch pad with a pencil. It was as if she'd simply dropped from heaven. The pencil whizzed over the paper, she turned out drawings and diagrams with a ferocity that can only be marveled that she was there and then just suddenly puffed, she was gone. They say we shall not see her like again. But this is incorrect, as a second pencil least will be appearing shortly God willing, if my prayers have been answered, and why should they not be there is something dismal about don't allow once one wonders far from the shopping parade. any sense of civic ohms is dispelled The further away one is from wall a new Gar. But I suppose the same could be said of virtually any cluster of buildings, any human settlement in any of the district of any of the regions in any of the countries on any of the continents on any of the planets in any of the solar systems. It cannot be said of this The seas are very different from the land. The seas are soaking wet and riddled with fish and cephalopods and huge aquatic monsters which suddenly crash to the surface and overturn our puny human boats, capsizing them, and all who sail in them.

Unknown Speaker  25:41
A couple of readings now from a perennial favorite of those of us that the yard This is a from further science book 20 by Norman Davies regional animals one that cold arctic animals seal etc. are large of blubber, fat norwall short nosed, split flipper tails and legs, smooth hide, all black, all white, etc. to temperate animals are larger, square bodied, long legged, slower farmyard, wooly Fox, dig and bite have high shoulders, big hollow horns or none, black and white patches, etc. Three, subtropical animals, Cheetah, elephant etc. are fast running, jumping or heavy slow, large heads, fat or long thin spots or black and white striped, smaller antelope square boffi long legs, hollow horns and solid ivory, rodents rats etc. For tropical animals our long low short legged mongoose murky long tail or apes, none feathery wings or spines, big long ears, corny Rhino skin, et cetera five Arctic are rounder, temperate macro square, subtropical micro square, tropical long and narrow. This is the general theme. There are myriad exceptions.

Frank Key  28:01
of this week show my thanks to pansy cradle drew for additional readings and Johnny seven for being the engineer that that was a particularly good bit of further science book 20 although some animals are big, some animals are small. Seems to be the general gist of it. But I think scientifically impeccable. Bye bye. back next week.
