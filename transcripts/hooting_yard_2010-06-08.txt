It is indeed time for hooting yard. My name is Frank key, and I'm gonna read to you for about half an hour. Excuse me, I haven't been here for a couple of weeks last week the studio was shot. And the week before that, I can't remember what happened, but I wasn't here. But I'm back. And what we have this week is a poetry special sort of. Anyway, there's two items that feature poetry, and this is the first one. It saddens me to report that we the poet Dennis beer pint has been caught red handed in an act of plagiarism. His verse, The Fountainhead hamartia ayn rand, from his well received recent collection, a series of homage is to female right wing rosol American postage stamp collectors was, it seems lifted word for word from this paragraph in compound words, a study of the principles of compounding the components of compounds, and the use of the hyphen by Frederick W. Hamilton, published in 1918, by the Committee on education of the United type poverty of America. And this is the paragraph from that book that Dennis Pierpont stole 41 The following is a list of words of everyday occurrence which should be hyphenated and which do not fall under any of the above classifications. After years foodstuffs sea level, bats relief guinea pigs sense perception, birthright horsepower son in law, blood relations loanword subject matter common sense man of war thought process cross examine object lesson titled page, cross reference page proof wavelength cross section payroll well being deathrite Paul or well nigh folks on post office willpower Fountainhead These rules are the consensus of opinion of a considerable number of good authorities from divin 1901 to manly and Pao 1913. The only change Dennis Pierpont makes is to add an exclamation mark after Fountainhead, presumably to remind himself to shout the word triumphantly recycles triumphantly at the end of this.

In Thailand bears dream 1769 Dennis DeNiro has border say this. But here's a strange fact which countless educated people will tell you is true, but which is false, namely that in the poultry yard of the Archduke, they've seen a disgusting rabbit who used to act as a cock and service around 20 shameless hens who were happy with the arrangement. The people will add that they have been shown some chickens covered with fiber, which were the product of this bestiality, you can be sure they were ridiculed. I read that and clearly my next step was to conduct a rigorous survey of the poultry yards of large groups. And within minutes of beginning my research, I struck gold. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised to learn that it was a topic to which Dobson had turned his attention in his pamphlet to poultry yards of the Grand arch Kooks out of print. Latter Day as Hadrian Everland would put it, I then struck base metal for it turns out this is one of the rarest of the rare of jobs and pamphlets, and I couldn't get my hands on a copy. try as I might. Not that I tried very hard, having other things on my mind, such as pencils performance in the World Cup, guff, pomposity, and potato crisps of which more later If it pleases Your Lordship. Now, the obtain ability of a pamphlet will deal a knockout blow to a weedy milk syrup researcher But I'm made of sterner stuff. I got down a beaker of squelch show. And dead of night I stole out to the weird woods of Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo, and sought out the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. I found her crouching in a patch of nettles moving her withered arms in some incomprehensible but no doubt eldritch fashion and muttering gibberish good old Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. I thought to myself, she never lets you down. Not at least if you remember to bring her a gift as I did. I greeted her and handed over a rather smudge back number of the Reader's Digest. I had no idea to what weird and spooky use she would put it, but it's better not to ask. She gave the magazine a couple of gummy bites to make sure it was genuine. And then asked me in her weird Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo voice what I wanted. I cleared my throat Are you familiar with the out of print pamphleteer? Dobson? I asked her. When I spoke aloud the great man's name. An owl hooted and a wolf howled the Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo. woman's head moved slightly. In what might have been a nod. It was either that or a magical spasm. I pressed on. There is an unobtainable pamphlet by Dobson which I feel impelled to read a woman of Whoo hoo hoo, Dee Woo. I continued, and I was wondering if through your tremendously strange powers, you might be able to commune with transients shimmer rings of ectoplasmic doo da and somehow have transmitted to you the full text of this pamphlet, entitled The paltry yards of the Grand arch Dukes and declaim it to me here in the weird woods in moonlight, while I scribbled down what you say in my notepad with my propelling pencil. I patted my pocket to indicated to indicate that I had come prepared with these essential items. The Whoo hoo hoo the woman did some business with a toad and a new and a hacksaw and some parsley and the bleached and boiled skull of a Starling and a handful of breadcrumbs. And there was a mighty flash of eerie incandescence across the sky, and a boom as of thunder, and then she began to rise in hideous jarring contortions. As the night air grew chill is the grave. Then she began to babble, and I started scribbling. When we were done, I patted the weird woman on her weird head, promised her further back copies of the Reader's Digest, or carp talk her other favorite periodical, and headed for home cluttering the precious recovered text. I had a long day's work ahead of me, transcribing the scribble in my notepad using my I Woo, a fantastic new device from Apple, specifically designed for the transcription of unearthly hallucinatory babblings into tough, sensible prose.

Frank Key  08:15
I chuckled to myself, wondering what Dobson would have made about 21st century technology. Somehow, I couldn't imagine the great man twittering or Facebooking or posting videos on YouTube. So there is of course, that tantalizing paragraph in his pamphlet, tantalizing paragraphs about the world over the future, out of print, where he seems to be hinting at some kind of handheld operators called an eye roschin. I must have looked it up and parlayed my observations into a post engine looting yard website one of these days. As soon as I got home just after dawn, I switched on or as they say, nowadays, powered up my I Whoo, and left it to bleep and hum while I fixed a solid breakfast. This involved more eggs than you can shake a stick at, which is a goodly number of eggs, I can tell you. This is my own breakfast recipe called Hitchcock's nightmare, or alternatively, or world glut. All of my many and various breakfast recipes are named after writers, painters and film directors, and I have one I hope one day to cobble them together into a compendium, but a more urgent task was at hand. What I wondered had Dobson had to say about the polka yards of the Grand arch Kooks in that rare, a rare pamphlet. The eye Wu hissed and gathered like some living organism as it tackled the bonkers babbling of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. But before sunset, I have a printout. It ran to 40 pages of densely set text color imitating the authentic look of I guess standard pamphlet direct from marigold chews shed. I was too exhausted to read it then and there, so I shoved it into a drawer and went to bed. During the night, I had that dream about the kiboko gift again. The next morning after a breakfast I call a Claude Chabrol special. I sat down to read, I was careful to bear in mind that what I was reading was not Dobson as such, but Dobson as filtered through the eerie, inexplicable powers of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman, a different text entirely. Nonetheless, it was the nearest I could get to the pamphlet his own words. Dobson or the Wu Dobson began by listing the grand arch Kooks whose poultry yards he had studied. It was an incredibly long and tedious list, packed with lewd vigs and videos and homeruns and Gotham guys to Oryx and done bertos here and there, a few biographical or historical details were scattered about, but nothing about poultry yards nor indeed disgusting rabbits. Next came one of those dogs, sonian, digressions, sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating. This one was firmly in the latter camp, being an extended meditation upon stars and yeast, neither of which topics. The pamphleteer seemed to have a clue about. By the time we'd finished Wittering, I was halfway through the recovered pamphlet, and still waiting to learn about its ostensible subject matter. I began to wonder if the Whoo hoo hoo Dee hoo woman had played a joke on me actually really been in contact with Ecto plasmic beings from a realm beyond our puny understanding, or was she just raving? I wanted to trust her, not least because I paid good money for that back number of the Reader's Digest from old mar purgatives, anti communist secondhand periodical shop. But of course, I need not have worried after some closing Flim Flam about boiled yeast, the Wu Dobbs and at last got to the matter in hand. Here was the sentence that made me sit bolt upright. It is patently obvious to anyone who has studied these things that all grande arch groups, maintaining paltry yards upon their estates around which disgusting rabbits proud, did so because of a fanatical devotion to the cause of unreason. He goes on to explain, unfortunately, this is where the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman's channels of communication with the mysterious realms seem to have broken down a tad. And I quote again, from what she told me as the pamphlet, I say, painfully obvious, because it's both paitent and obvious. Consider

Frank Key  13:12
the answer on regime. Consider it again. Imagine yourself strutting about the corridors of the arch Ducal Palace. Is your path blocked by hens? It is? Why are the hens not in their coop in the poultry yard? Hear them clucking. If you could translate that clucking, into human speech, specifically hide Germanic speech as spoken by quite a number of grinder cooks. What do you think they would be saying? eek eek, we are in fear of the disgusting rabbit to skulk about the perimeter of our yard. You might argue that rabbits are one of the last animals on earth, whose method of propelling themselves hither and thither could be described as skulking. You might argue that, but do you want to be seen arguing with hens in your palace corridor by one of your foot men or valets? Whoa, whoa, whoa, they would snare your minions later downstairs in their pantry. The old fool was arguing with hens who ever heard of such a thing? thereafter, they would treat you with contempt, and even come to question your arch Kook dumb. The lettered ones among them might start reading insurrectionist pamphlet produced by Beardy German revolutionaries, better by far, never to argue with hens in the corridor, no matter how panic stricken they appear, gather them up one by one and put them right back in their coop in the poultry yard. Send a rider to dash on horseback to the land grave in his distant fastness to alert him to the presence of disgusting rabbits. His forces may sweep in within days or weeks or not at all for you can never second guessed the landgrave he has his own hands in his own poultry yard, where he argues with them all day long for max interbreeding and his noble line has made him soft in their head. See him dribble, see him drool. See him argue frantically with this hand and that hand holding his hand himself around the poultry yard on the crutches which support his withered legs. The legs of his hens are withered too, as are the legs of the disgusting rabbit who surrounds his castle. Yes, he has his own disgusting rabbits to contend with, as do all land graves and Mar graves and grand arch groups in the Ansan regime, you would do well to learn that and to cease your whining. Struck your corridors as you may for one day all will crumble the foot man and the valets will break out of the pantry and run amok, and there will be traffic between the terrified hens and the disgusting rabbits. Oh, odious, odious, but now you have glimpsed what is to come. You must be a fierce and ruthless grand Archduke in all your finery, though it may frayed tatters.

Frank Key  16:18
I will leave it to the experts to judge if that is the authentic voice of Dobson over witless prattle of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. Either way, it takes us some way towards a better understanding of the hens of unreason. And that is all we set out to do in our modest way, on this summer's day.

Frank Key  17:06
Now, for the second part of our poetry special, this is a poetry masterclass. And I'm joined by pansy cradle Jew who's going to recite the poem, which I will be critiquing, warning by Jenny Joseph, is apparently Britain's best loved postwar poem. It's said to be life affirming pack, who needs life to be affirmed when, as Dr. Malcolm said, and as we all know, life will find a way. Anyway, let's take a look at the poem Shall we?

Unknown Speaker  17:46
When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple.

Frank Key  17:50
Well, I'm not a woman, but I am old and I'm not wearing purple. I'm not Eric Saffy, for God's sake.

Unknown Speaker  17:58
With a Red Hat, which doesn't go and doesn't suit me.

Frank Key  18:03
The only people who habitually wear red hats are Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, at the time of writing, women, whether old or young, are not allowed to become priests, let alone Cardinals. So there's some kind of cognitive dissonance going on here.

Unknown Speaker  18:21
And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves, and satin sandals and say we've no money for butter.

Frank Key  18:31
Now this demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of Bismarck domestic policy in late 19th century Germany. It was guns before butter, not brandy and gloves and footwear. What sort of nation state can you expect to build? If everybody tosses around in a stupor brought on by spirits or liquor, decked out like the most foolish of new romantics

Unknown Speaker  18:57
I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired.

Frank Key  19:02
Actually, that's fair enough, so that line can stand but only that one so far.

Unknown Speaker  19:09
And gobble up samples and shops and press alarm bells and run my stick along the public railings and make up for the sobriety of my youth.

Frank Key  19:20
Now you bloody well want because you're slumped on the pavement or preferably in the gutter. Remember, you're far too tired to get up and start charging around the place as described here, because your tiny brain is exhausted from all that catch up reading you've had to do to correct your misunderstanding of German history.

Unknown Speaker  19:41
I shall go out in my slippers in the rain and pick flowers and other people's gardens and learn to spit.

Frank Key  19:51
Nobody learns to spit. You just spit. In any case, whether learned or innate. If you spit and steal You'll get an asbo and so you should carry on and you'll be banged up in a large concrete building with iron bars on the windows and Mater so mailbags until you die, whereupon you'll be buried in an unmarked grave over which quicklime will be poured to hasten your dissolution. I may have an outmoded view of prison conditions, but a man can dream.

Unknown Speaker  20:26
You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat.

Frank Key  20:30
Oh, so all of a sudden this is about me. It's all very well casting aspersions upon my majestic dress sense etc. From behind prison walls. But I'm not the one forced to wear a rough sack cloth uniform covered in arrows and withering away on a bread and water diet. See above the prison conditions

Unknown Speaker  20:53
and eat three pounds of sausages at a go.

Frank Key  20:57
Yes, thank you. I'll eat as many sausages as I like. That line can stand to

Unknown Speaker  21:05
or only bread and pickle for a week.

Frank Key  21:08
You don't understand German history, and you don't listen. I have no idea where you get the idea. There might be pickles on the menu. See above bread and water, not bread and pickle

Unknown Speaker  21:21
and hoard pens and pencils and beer mats and things in boxes.

Frank Key  21:27
stationery is fine. But you won't need a beer mat for your rusty beaker of water. And what in heaven's name have these things in boxes lovecraftian monsters with suckers. And then tenei you've got another thing coming if you think they'll stay happily boxed up. As soon as you turn your back, they'll burst from their confines and latch on to your throat and drain the lifeblood from you what's left of it. And they'll make an absolutely terrifying noise while they do so.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
But now we must have clothes that keep us dry and pay our rent and not swear in the street. And set a good example for the children.

Frank Key  22:10
Pure wishful thinking, given that you're sprawled on the cold stone floor of your prison cell with a hideous alien being that defies all known organic lineaments wrapped around your neck, sucking your blood, and slowly, slowly crushing the last breath out of you.

Unknown Speaker  22:31
We must have friends to dinner and read the papers

Frank Key  22:36
by the papers. I assume you mean those academic papers about Bismarck that you ought to have been reading when you still had the chance to light to light.

Unknown Speaker  22:48
But maybe I ought to practice a little now. No. So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised when suddenly I am old and start to wear purple.

Frank Key  23:02
Yeah, yeah. And I'm Eric satty. Get a grip for God's sake. First, from the whole poem, we're left with two lines of clarity out of a load of delusional twaddle.

Unknown Speaker  23:18
I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired and eat three pounds of sausages at a go.

Frank Key  23:25
And even that can be cut to make it more punchy.

Unknown Speaker  23:29
I shall sit down and eat sausages.

Frank Key  23:33
Now that's a poem The nation can be proud of.

Frank Key  23:57
Thank you very much to pansy cradle Joo there for reading that splendid poem by splendid poem. I mean, the final one, I shall sit down and eat sausages. Meanwhile, glad tidings from pointy town, where there has been a massive increase in the number of applications to join the local chapter of the Tuesday Weld fan club. You may recall that a troop of pointy town welded on a nail start Sherif Bang couting made an important archaeological discovery. If by chance you don't recall it. I can refer you back to it if you visit the hooting yard website and click on the magic of an internet hyperlink. Incidentally, did you know that British Telecom once tried unsuccessfully to claim copyright on the word hyperlink? That's true. Though you will not believe similar stories such as Tesco laying claim to the phrase sausages on the cheap. The Guardian trying for money All headed left the blather or both the BBC and ITV attempting to copyright Maverick police officer with issues. Anyway, it appears that the tale of the finding of the tomb of an accident grow tax, which is what the hyperlink would lead you to drum up an unprecedented amount of interest in the Tuesday Weld fan club. In spite of the fact that many younger pointy towners have absolutely no idea who Tuesday Weld is. Perhaps they think if they're allowed to join the club, they'll be taken on Shera bank outings by sinister spider drivers, although my understanding is that there have been no excursions since the last one, which was reported here. In fact, there's some mystery regarding the precise activities of the fan club for life held November 8. jumble sales. Well, the film's all film screenings for a very long time. Even their newsletter welled, published every week on Tuesday has ceased to appear in the news agents kiosks have pointed down. I did manage to track down the minutes of the most recent executive committee meeting, but it was difficult to wring any sense out of them. Take this for example. We lend our ears to a man standing on one leg who puffed upon a flute and called us fools. When he did so he stretched out the EU in fools so that it lasted several minutes. During the whole time, he maintained his mono pod posture. Eventually, he was asked by well this number for seven to how this implication related to Tuesday Well, in reply, he gave another somewhat Wheezy puff on his flute and stole softly away, like jack in the green. Is this evidence of some sort of esoteric hoo ha going on in the precious previously staid atmosphere of the Tuesday Weld fan club? Certainly, the sheer numbers of new applicants suggest a coup or takeover. But what in heaven's name could their agenda be? I shall keep a BB if myopic eye on these matters, and may send Mrs. gubbins to be an infiltrator among the infiltrators.

Frank Key  27:36
Finally, this week, a quotation about idiots. Before I do so I just like to remind listeners, particularly those listening to the podcast, that you are implored to make small donation to hooting yard, you don't have to, but it would be very much appreciated. And this is actually a serious point. That it would be very nice if anyone took any notice of it, which no one seems to have done apart from one person. And so if you're a podcast listener, send hooting yard a bit of cash via PayPal, go to the hooting yard website. This is john Ruskin, from the mystery of life and its arts from 1868 6000 years have passed since we were set to till the ground from which we were taken, how much of it is tilled? How much of that which is wisely or Well, in the very center and chief garden of Europe, where the two forms of parent Christianity have had their fortresses, where the noble Catholics of the forest cantons and the noble Protestants of the voad wild valleys have maintained for dateless ages, their faith and liberties. Their the unchecked our pine rivers yet run wild in devastation. And the marshes which a few hundred men could redeem with a year's labor, still blast their helpless inhabitants in just fevered idiot ism. I didn't know that apparently, that if you live in the marshes, you've been blasted into fevered idiot ism, but Ruskin said it, so it must be true. That's the end of hooting guard on the air for this week. My thanks again to pansy cradle Jew for reading that poem. And I'll be back with more stuff next week. Bye bye.
