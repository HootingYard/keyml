Good evening. This is hooting out on the air bit slightly later than normal. But that's resonance. Yes, hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for half an hour or slightly less. Those of those of you who listened for a long time will know that hooting yd apart from being a radio show is also of course, a blog. This December it will be six years old. And there are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of words to read it updated almost every day. And so you should always pay a visit to voting yard. Those of you who have blogs of your own and even if you haven't, well know that you can look at your blog stats, you know, how did people get to you? Where did they come from and so on. And one of the things one of the stats I was looking at a hooting yard yesterday was was the the search terms that people put into Google or to other search engines that lead them to hooting yard and consistently the two most popular search terms which have led interweb hikers to swing open the gates of hooting yard, far ahead of any other terms are bees, and Ecto plasm. Occasionally some befuddled soul gets there after searching for be ectoplasm. Another favorite much to my delight is googie withers, though the 92 year old screen siren gets misspelled as Google withers in some searches, which makes one wonder what's going on inside some people's cranium integuments. And then of course, there are the search terms which are resting in their singularity. Yesterday, someone came to hooting yard because they wanted to find out about and I quote the exact phrase, character flaw of medieval peasant, unquote. Anyway, perhaps I should write a piece in which googie withers taunted by a particularly pesky be paralyzes it with a splurge of ectoplasm. Or alternatively, a be taunted by a particularly pesky nonagenarian actress stops her in her tracks by emitting a jet of Ecto plasmic be goo. either scenario would provide heroic tot tiny Enid with the perfect pretext to come clumping clubfoot ugly to the rescue of either googie, withers or B. So which of those scenes warms your cockles? If you go to the hooting yard website at hooting yard.org you can vote you can vote for which scene you prefer googie withers using ectoplasm to fight off a B or A B using Ecto plasm to fight off googie withers. So vote now and vote often. And in a comment on on that piece, which appeared on hooting yard yesterday. My reader known only as our commented, I think there could be some useful mileage in Lillian Gish plus wasps to I'm afraid to say that this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the connections between stars of the silver screen and the sorts of insects that bows and fly and sting the aculeatus hymenoptera. a modicum of research reveals a plethora of anecdotal material linking googie withers with bees. Much of this is hearsay, and some of its undoubtedly fictitious, merely the product of fuming brains careening pell mell into paltrinieri for want of any more useful employment. Nevertheless, bloody good anecdote age should never be discounted entirely, as Dobson once said, at a picnic. Conversely, conversely, say it again Danny Oh, you will wander the world for umpteen years before you ever come upon a reliable dish wasp story. Now useful mileage there may be if we're talking about Tallulah Bankhead and Hornets, or Nova Pilbeam and German wasps, or even Vilma, bankey and bees. In the latter case, we even have a story involving Ecto plasmic be Gu, though it has been suppressed by DOMA bankies a state for understandable reasons. I hope that makes things clear.

So, I said that someone came to hooting yard after looking for the phrase, character flaw of medieval peasant. And specifically to placate that person. I wrote a piece in titled character flaw of medieval peasant. So if I come back, think how happy they'll be. Hello, my name is Cliff guard, and I am a medieval peasant. I am calling to you across the centuries, because I want to tell you about my character flaw. It is not, I'm afraid to say a character flaw that would elevate me into the realm of the tragic. That would be a splendid floor to have. But I am a mere peasant. And as I look about me in this veil of tears, it has not escaped my attention. That tragic and indeed, heroic character flaws, tends to be displayed by princelings and such. Mine is more what you might call a mundane floor. One of the reasons I decided to bellow so hectically that time itself is been designed and shrunk, is that I know with a fair degree of certainty, that no poet nor playwright is ever likely to consider my character flaw a subject for their pen, or I should say, quill or scratchy stick. I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be I don't even know who Prince Hamlet is, or was or will be, and I was always meant to be a peasant to is wrecked upon the stars. My character flaw is a tendency to overdo the groveling when confronted by a Baron. When I see one approach upon his horse, in all his finery, glittering and clanking, accompanied by his retinue, I immediately start to snowball and slobber and I picked myself forward, face forward. I'm going to start that sentence again. When I see one approach upon his horse in all his finery, glittering and clanking, accompanied by his retinue, I immediately start to snuggle and slobber and I pinch myself forward face down into the muck. Medieval mark is much much filthier than your modern muck. It oozes and stinks and harbors all sorts of miniscule disgusting life forms, things you have eradicated through science and hygiene. While that's prostrate, I begin to groan incoherently. What I'm actually trying to express is the sense that I am bought a worm unfit to exist on the same planet as the Baron, who is brighter than the sun, and completely fantastic. But my basement is such that I cannot form the proper words with my mouth, which in any case is by now packed with mud. Bear in mind that at this stage, the Baron and his retinue have only just Hove interview on the horizon. This is partly what I mean by overdoing the groveling. My fellow medieval peasants are all still going about their business, tilling the fields or scratching at their buboes or in the throes of the Korea imagine ativa estimate Eva, dancing in a frenzy. When the Baron gets closer, a goodly number of them will tug their forelocks and dribble with happiness at the sight of him. But I feel this urge to outdo them. This is my character flaw. And it's made all the more pathetic by the fact that the Baron will not even notice my existence. I'm pretty certain this is the case. But over the years, not a single Baron passing through our bailiwick has ever acknowledged me, they might come on their retinue to smash up the medieval farming tools, and hacket those tilling the fields with their big sharp swords, or they might or they might burn down our huts, or very, very occasionally, they might turn out to be a so called good Baron, and distribute arms and large s. But because of my ludicrous grovel, flat on my belly and the mark groaning away, I seem to have escaped their attention. There there is, I suppose, an advantage to this in that I've never had one of my limbs sliced off or smashed to pieces, but there again, nor have I been presented with a Groat by a good barons alms giving to

swings and roundabouts. Fate is meant to decide the lot of a medieval peasant like me. But the nature of my character flaw is such that I become a sort of invisible peasant merged with the market which I sprawl. And so fate passes me by, if I could just once stand straight and tall, well, not tall exactly because nutritional deficiencies mean I'm stunted and shriveled. But if I could at least stop basing myself quite so preposterously. As soon as I spot a barren half a mile off, then who knows what I might reap. I dare say in your world of the future, there are still peasants with character flaws, and good barons and bad barons. And I expect the peasants still till and scratch and dance, and the barons are still really terrific and shines so brightly, fate will arrange things just so I assume. Even though fate has taken one withering look at me and left me where I am slobbering in the muck.

Time now for one of those ever popular hooting yd folk songs, which I spare you the horror of me singing, but I kind of read because that's probably a better way to do it. Anyway, here's his, uh, his uh, folks on the mountain apothecary with his bag so black, is it a bag? Or is it a sack? He he used it up the mountain on his back. It is full of pills and potions. But no one lives upon this peak. So as he climbs Who does he seek? Ah, look, a goat a goat so weak, he'll pamper it with his lotions. The mountain apothecary is no vet. The weakened goats are heroes pet. He crapped it once within a net, but now it roams the slopes. The air is thin when one so high, the goat is weak and it may die. The apothecary wears a Catholic tie. He's created several Pope's a typist apothecary do you say on the mountain this very day, I would drown him in the bay for I say he's a sinner. I am a sinner and a heretic. Evil is what makes him tick. Almighty God He makes me sick. I'll vomit up my dinner. I ate in the chalet at the foot of the mount me and a Baron and a Protestant count. Oh, we ate a huge amount of mountain goat and hog see the apothecary come back down. He's taking his goat into the town where there's a vet of great renown. I'll shove him into the bug. Pay piste apothecary drowned in bog says the headline in my daily log now are marked off into the fog and vanish whence I came. I came from haunts of kooten Hearn there I watched the papacy burn, repent before it is your turn and shudder at my name.

Oh Dobson thou art sick. Thou art sick amid the blossoms. Oh, what shall we do? What shall we do? let thy pamphlets be our guide. This was the little recitation made Oso plaintively by a band of hiking orphans, who stumbled upon a second feverish Dobson in a blossom strewn field one morning in 1956. orphan hikes were a short lived social phenomenon of the decade, one which is almost forgotten today. Inspired by the Swiss film masterpiece, the hiking orphans, children all across the land, gathered into groups and went marching off the hill and dale munching toffee apples and consulting extensively detailed maps. so popular did the hikes become that many of the tots taking part we're not actually orphans at all. So became dab hands at forging death certificates. Others suffocated mama and papa in their beds or poisoned their breakfast cereal. Dobson became the sort of patron saint of the orphan hikers following the publication of his pamphlet. My parents are dead, but Christ I adore hiking out of print because of the blasphemous abuse of the Lord's name in the title. The pamphlet was swiftly banned and the print run pulped. But such was the demand from hiking tinies that illegal getestet Medical copies were soon circulating. Often secreted in the folds of the extensively detailed maps the orphans carried in waterproof pouches strung from the lanyards hung around their scrawny necks. These maps were themselves a Marvel, more extensively detailed than any other maps ever made. It was said that the most extensively detailed of them showed the precise alignment of calf injuries perched on the branches of an Aspen you would pass if you bore left at the hedge in which a rusted farm implement had been shoved and abandoned. Unusually, Dobson's pamphlet included an illustration of the great man, ally no cut by the hyper realist ally no cutter wrecked hyper, which showed the pamphleteers visarjan breathtaking Hyper Realism so familiar was his face to the more indefatigable often hikers who poured over it whenever they sat down on a log to rest, that when a band of them came upon the second feverish figure sprawled amid the blossoms. They instantly recognized him as Dobson. Hence their plaintive recitation. Let us posit, oh Dobson, thou art sick. The orphans are making it plain that they recognize the crumpled invalid for who he is. And they recognize too that unlike the blossoms are made, which he languages, he is far from blooming. We might criticize them for not being more specific in their diagnosis of his au. But also remember that they're mere tots and orphaned tots that, except for the one called Vin chendo, who is a fraudulent often having used his pocket money to purchase a counterfeit newspaper cutting, claiming his mom and pop perished in an avalanche. Thou art sick amid the blossoms. By repeating their declaration of the pamphleteers medical condition, the orphans reinforce its seriousness. This is no fugitive swoon nor spasm they are saying, nor is Dobson lying there with his limbs have splayed out because he has simply tripped upon a clump. And having driven home the point, they go on to place it in a geographical location amid the blossoms. If an air ambulance is caught puttering in the vicinity equipped with fantastic sound detection technology, calibrated to pick up piping often voices, they have pitched their recitation superbly. But of course, in 1956, such air ambulances were rare and rarer still, those with fantastic sound detection technology calibrated to pick up piping often voices, and the chances of one hovering in range of the blossom bit strewn field, in which Dobson lies crumple, are so remote as to be not worth a fig. Tiny they may be, but the orphans know this. And thus the despair of the next line.

Oh, what shall we do? We may be brave and Dowty, hikers they say we may be free from our often repressed and oppressive parents, God rest their souls. Except for Vincente those obviously, yet, we are still but fragile and vulnerable. tinies and faced with this dramatic medical emergency, we are a bit flummoxed, and in some cases about to burst into tears. What shall we do? The repetition here is a pleasing echo of the repetition of thou art sick in the opening lines. It also commands our attention. The orphan hikers are not locking about. They are confronting, probably for the first time in their lives, a mortal dilemma, toughened as they are, by their hikes, were able to forge streams. negotiate Bramble patches and vaults dry stone walls and run screaming from flocks of savage angry swans. They are not so tough, but they can cope with the sight of a second feverish pamphleteer amid the blossoms. Well, Vincenzo can because he is, let's say an interesting little chap. The way in which his voice drops out of the recitation for this pair of lines. lenzen added harmonic response. If one is listening with jus care. let thy pamphlets be our guide. When Kansas voice returns for this triumphant ending, there is renewed hope, medically ignorant and lacking such caters bandages and tablets and proprietary nerve tonics. The orphans have one invaluable resource, the stricken pamphlet his own pamphlets for all of them, their imaginations sparked by Dobson's illegal pamphlet on hiking, having acquired their own little collection of his works, which they carry with them wherever they hike. They realize that by taking all their Dobson pamphlets out of their pouches and combing through the texts, they are bound to alight upon a passage absolutely pertinent to the situation. As the pamphleteer himself continues to grow amid the blossoms, the orphans ends their recitation on this note of optimism. So there we have the words in context. What's curious is that for as long as the orphan hiking fad continued thereafter, roughly until the winter of 1958, the recitation became a sort of generic chant along the lines of the Seven Dwarves Heigh Ho, heigh. Ho, it's off to work we go. Having been cured, and then recuperated in a clinic a few yards away from the blossom be strewn field. Dobson was at Highland sprightly as ever, a fortnight after the orphans stumbled upon him. And yet, they carried on counting their recitation, as they hiked hither and yon, from the outskirts of pointy town, to the terrifying grim black, mountainous horror of God, and even further afield, to places beyond imagining, and as our little band crossed paths with other hiking orphans, their chant was picked up until all across the land from ballista lane to the big wet see, every hiking often knew the words by heart, and chanted and hummed and held them as they hiked.

Last week, so logical farm hosted the budget spinning traveling players, a troupe of bumpkin and whisk wielding theatrical persons, famed for their reconstructions of historical episodes. Their current production, the one that had the sludge whole farm yokels gulping was a dramatization of the first blanket resignation of 2004. That was the one where relinquishing the post of Home Secretary, our hero, went on television and spoke more crucially, tearfully and repeatedly about the little lad, a bit of homespun phraseology, designed to tug at the heartstrings of the nation. It certainly had that effect on the sludge whole farm farm hands, at least when acted by bulges spinneys most accomplished thespian blasto Harbin the racket made by the peasant copius sobbing almost drowned out the closing para ration by the chorus. In order to have sufficient pretext for wielding their bog kins and whisks, the players set their blanket or Rama in the 14th century. This also allowed them to incorporate the gruesome battle scenes for which they have become notorious. In a particularly splendid segment, the home Secretary's trusty guide dog Ruby, or possibly Teddy or offer or Lucy or savy single poorly fought off a pack.

Note no cows were harmed during the making of this amateur dramatic extravaganza. And nor were any cows harmed during the making of this week's hooting yard on the air, which now comes to an end and I will be back with you next week. Don't forget to go and vote on the website. Bye bye
