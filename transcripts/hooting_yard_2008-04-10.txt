Good evening and welcome to hooting yard on the air. With me Frank key for 30 minutes approximately of prose that's sensible, morally uplifting and instructive. In today's botany lesson, we're going to study a stalk of faffed and bladder word. We're going to examine it very very closely with the naked eye, and then under a microscope, and then from an exemplary distance through a telescope, which will thoroughly sniff it. Having first had our nasal passages cleared and fumigated with a nasal fumigation, siphon and pump contraption, specially made for us by a boffin. We are going to test the effect upon it of both extreme heat and extreme cold, as well as room temperature and other exemplary temperatures it is likely to encounter in walking laughingly still be referred to as the real world. Thus far I have spoken of both distance and temperature as being exemplary, and I have not finished with my exemplars. We are going to attach electrical wires to the stalk of fattens bladder word and subjected to low and high voltages using a targeted electrical voltage delivery contraption specially made for us by a boffin which will designate one such voltage as an exemplary voltage for reasons which will become apparent. immersion in a tub of water will be the next step. We will be using water from the duck pond, having first boiled it and allowed it to cool. The water will be collected from the duck pond in pails, then transferred to a pan. It will be allowed to cool in the pan before being poured into the tub through a funnel. Rubber gloves will be worn during this procedure. The color of the rubber gloves worn is open to choice except that they ought not be the same color as the stalk of Fountains bladder words. A rubber glove pigmentation chart has been specially prepared for us by a boffin and we shall refer to it before plumping for our rubber gloves. We will then test the pH value of the stalk of fattens bladder word before breaking for lunch. Lunch will be served in the sixth floor canteen, the prices are reasonable and the queues are short. There is a goodly selection of pies cereals, trunks of unidentified meat out barley thievery from squirrels, winter storage, baked turnips, cocoa powder, blood oranges, various animal innards, gravy and boats and gravy and a spoon, plums balsamic vinegar, toffee pudding, densely challenging biscuits and crackers, clam chowder wafers with a drizzle of light ale pastries, dried citrus husks, flamand, lemon curd, bogs, sludge and aspirins. The singsong will take place immediately after lunch in the sixth floor canteen annex. Song sheets in a bold hectoring typeface have been specially prepared for us by a Madrigal list. upon our return we will slice up the stalk of faff Flynn's bladder word with a big shopping exemplary slicing implement. There will then be a test paper in multiple choice format to be completed in pencil. The rubber gloves should be disposed off down a chute, the location of which will be announced into time. Any questions?

Any questions? Indeed, there are some questions we can answer without hesitation. asked what's your favorite website 100% of sensible people immediately shout hooting Yod Of course, with unhinged and hysterical enthusiasm say When asked in which school Book Depository, they would prefer to cite a sniper's nest. An overwhelming number of would be assassins reply, the Texas School Book Depository at 411 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas 752023317. Without a doubt, For my part, and in spite of the intervening decades, a question I can answer without even thinking is, what was your favorite Weekly Comic when you were tiny? For me, it was the hammer of Christ, and within it, the strip I most adored was busta and rad BOD. Each week I followed the adventures of the chirpy Judo with my jaw dropped and drool flowing freely down my chin, my heart and pulse rates pounding desperately. It was through busta and rad BOD that I learned to read, and I'm forever in their debt. They were in many ways, an ill matched fictional pair. Buster was squat hissy and preening given to throwing fits and always a tide and a bright yellow duffle coat, and a little pointed wooden cap. He existed on a diet of chocolates which rolls sprat lettuce and untreated milk straight from the goat. We were never given a glimpse of the goat. But it was understood that it lived in a field a short walk across the verdant hills from busters house, under its name was Buttercup. Basta had more than one iron pail in which he would collect them milk, one painted red, and one unpainted, and a third extra special pail that leaked and that he was always promising to mend but never did. Buster had too many teeth crammed into inside his mouth, certainly more than a non fictional person would have. And some of them were sharpened into fangs. He liked to sit atop a rotating, cleanse and spin round and round until he was sick. I was always curious as to the engine which rotated the plinth. It bore a distinct resemblance to undersea drilling equipment I had seen either in real life or in catalogs. Although of course, nearly all of Buster and redbuds Adventures took place on dry land far from the sea. Buster was once or twice shown to be in possession of a pair of swimming trunks. They were visible in pictures of his open wardrobe alongside a snorkel and an oxygen canister, but I cannot recall him ever wearing them. past I had an owl as well as a goat. The owl was also called Buttercup and Buster treated it cruelly often pelting it with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts throughout the impossibly long afternoons of his idyllic fictional summertime. The owl took its revenge by regurgitating gobbets of semi digested stones or ways onto busters pointed wooden cap, which he would then have to rinse clean under the village spigot. Doing so was always a risky business, for lumbering in the vicinity of the village spigot was the village wrestler, a hairy brute capable of tearing an anvil in half with his great hairy hands. Luckily for buster, the village wrestler was trained to post next to the village spigot and he was blind. So usually it was possible to skip nimbly out of his reach, even though being squat Buster was not the most nimble of cartoon characters. Indeed, he was not nimble at all. He slouched and he trudged, and he often trailed one of his legs behind him as if he were a lame child. But this was just rough galaxy. Buster pretended to be lame to diddle small coinage from shopkeepers and the ground staff at the aerodrome, but most of them were wise to his tricks. in quite a few stories, basta and redboard mooched around the aerodrome, trying to enter the hangars, but they were invariably stymied by one circumstance or another, be the weather or early closing, or an attack of killer bees, or a rusty padlock.

Once when they were about to step into an unguarded an unlocked hangar what, sorry once they were about to step into an unguarded an unlocked hangar when they were surprised by the ghost of Sylvia Townsend Warner, and fled screaming into the hills. Other literary phantoms haunted the comic strip from time to time, for differing narrative purposes, are not always at the aerodrome. The Ghost of Emily Dickinson for example, hovers in midair outside the village shampoo list in several frames. Have a particularly exciting adventure in which a toggle on busters duffle coat is discovered to be a smooth round fragment from the tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. Basta hires a broom to fight off the ancient Egyptian goons who come to reclaim the pharaohs toggle. the hiring of brooms sweeping brushes, dusters squeegees rags and other cleaning materials is one of busters hobbies, along with bell ringing stamp collecting, making fluted paper cupcake cases, pelting his owl with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts. First World War battle reenactments, tongue twisters, snakes and ladders playing songs from the fort Marge Memorial dump LP on the glockenspiel, turning up froth in a pile, bandage sculpture, tic tac tacky talk, driving nails into mud idols subu to table football, poop tack platter tech whiz ping pong hopping about flapping his arms conjuring tricks, removing splinters from gashes, cardboard appreciation, amateur dramatics pencil sharpening scattering pins all over the place, bowling balls and dishes and running a flea circus. I thought of Buster rather than rad board as a role model. Buster had nonchalance, a LAN a filthy temper already wit and peevishness. He was in seussian when one of his lungs collapsed. He smoked retains. He sometimes wore his pointed wooden cap at a jaunty angle. He could hold his breath underwater for several very very tense minutes. He rattled about in a fantastic old jalopy. He had ambitions to be a bar g on an extensive system of canals. It was a dab hand with a banjo and not in a musical sense. Once he felt the blind Brook village Dressler with a simple flick of his duffle coat calf, and afterwards had the grace to polish the blind Brut Villa dressers train with a hired rag and his own homemade swore figure. He dazzled at cocktail parties. He spat upon hissing coals. He tiptoed from rooms with a swish of elegance. He was off on a frolic of his own rad board, by contrast, was a somewhat colorless character. Recently, I learned that a complete set of the hammer of Christ bound in the height of a cloven hooves the beast of the barnyard and containing all the adventures of busta and redboard will be for sale as an auction to be held at the dilapidated Custom House by the harbor steps in the stinking seaside resort where I usually spend my holidays. Now, I'm by no stretch of the imagination, an experienced auction goer. And I have no idea how to make a bid, do I naught or raise an eyebrow or hold up a pencil or flail my arms around? I do not want to cut an idiotic finger. But nor do I want to miss the chance to get my hands on such a treasure. It's a quandary to be sure I haven't given it much thought. I've decided to take my lead from Buster himself. In one episode of this most marvelous of comic strips, he goes to an auction at a Custom House, not unlike the auction at the Custom House I plan to attend. And when a lot he covets comes up, he sneaks outside and through an aperture pumps into the auction room a fast acting nerve gas. Or maybe it's just any old gas I can't quite remember. I suppose that something I should check before carrying out my nefarious plan. If I pump the wrong sort of gas through an aperture, who knows what might happen?

Frank Key  14:10
The problem is that just as I'm ignorant of bidding behavior auctions, I haven't got a clue about gases. I know there are lots of different kinds of gas and they act differently upon the people gathered in a room into which one or other of them is pumped through an aperture. But how might I go about picking my gas? It's an absolute mystery. And so for now, it shall remain for there is much that Trumps gas research in my daily round. And right now I feel as I so often do the call of the monkey and I must pick nits out of my hair and shovel bananas down my throat and swing from large to Sycamore in my large and Sycamore enclosure beyond the back garden. By the railway lines were hooting freight trains Thunder along the track carrying vast loads of pig on A pig on town where I have never been and will never go for it is far far away and built entirely from pig iron.

Recently, I posted a picture on the hooting yard website. I'm sure you know where it is by now. www dot hooting yard one word.org. Read you can read, endless, total. Anyway, recently I posted a picture on the hoogenraad website taken from a great blog, which I discovered called monster brains, which is basically a treasure trove of pictures of monsters and similar similar things. And the picture I chose, showed a wooden child upon a country lane being confronted by a fiery serpent. Rat was the monster in question. intriguingly, and in the picture of the serpent is belching fire not through its mouth but from its fundament. This is more common than you might think. Often when I roam the lines of my bailiwick, I come upon similar scenes of wooden tinies, being menaced by fiery serpents, and in a significant number of cases, serpentine fundament fire is seemed to occur for the serpent. The advantage of this is that when a public spirited figures such as myself chances upon it, and extinguishes the flames with a handy portable fire extinguisher, it does not gag or choke on the jet of exciting fire suppressant foam, as invariably happens with mouth sourced serpentine flames, but merely shrugs it off in as much as a serpent can shrug and slippers off on its merry way down the line. Unfortunately, I have to say that the Scottish wouldn't tinies who's in Perelman tie so selflessly avert tend to be an ungrateful not, and it's rare indeed, that I'm even thanked better alone given a reward. Nevertheless, I shall not stint in my roamings along the winding lanes of my bailiwick armed with my fire extinguisher. Another thing to look out for in the picture should you look at it on the website is the disposition of the trees. Anyway, shortly after that piece appeared, I received the following letter. Dear Mr. Key, I was minding my own business, sitting on my bench in the attic room of the Mercy Home for abandoned infants made of wood when my attention was drawn to your article entitled wooden child and fiery serpent and trees. I should at once make it clear that I am a wooden child, and that I often run errands along the very same lines of your bailiwick, such as the one shown in the picture, and that on numerous occasions when running such errands, I have been menaced by certain belching for flame from their mouths, or from their fundament and sometimes terrifyingly from both. Before I go on, you may be interested to know the nature of my errands. From time to time, the beetle at the Mercy Home or one of his lieutenants, will require a crate of crab apples or bandages or plums or dust or conference pears or talcum powder, or grease or vinegar cakes or mazi pan or holy water tablets or pins or assorted crustacea or similar projects to be collected from the village shop. Being the possessor of a withered leg, the Beatle himself is not able to undertake the journey along the winding lanes and his lieutenants are kept so busy grouting and leaving and scraping and plugging and patching up holes in the fabric of the Mersey home, but the task falls to one or another of the abandoned wooden infants such as myself. We happily do the Beatles bidding for old Mark dystopia who runs the village shop will usually treat us with a wooden biscuit or a wooden toffee apple before getting us to Sani impost for the crate we have come to collect tree as a kindly soul who is reputed to be over 200 years old and to have taken part in many folk tales, living as she does in her ramshackle shop deep in the day. And gloomy woods. She is certainly a keen observer of the disposition of trees.

What prompted me to write to you was your observation that the wooden tiny do rescue from perilous, fiery serpents a skittish and that you are rarely rewarded or thanked for your endeavors. Now, it's true enough that I do not recall a single occasion when menaced by a serpent on this or that errand. My impairment has been averted by you, or indeed, anyone like you, emerging from the shrubbery armed with a portable fire extinguisher. Granted that my memory is not the most acute given my head and all its innards, including the brain, like the rest of me made of wood. Yet I feel quite sure I would remember so stirring an incident. As it is, I've always had to affect my own deliverance from the threat of fiery serpents upon the lines using a combination of quick wits and wily stratagems. I am not lucky enough to carry my own fire extinguisher, partly because I am on my return journey at least laden with a crate of produce and thus hard puts to carry anything extra. But also because the Beagle is reluctant to let his tiny wooden charges get their hands on his one fire extinguisher, which he keeps bolted to the wall of his office. It is not the case that we are too skittish to being trusted with it, by the way, rather than a Beatle is a possessive and neurotic man pray to his own secret demons, for which I fervently hope he will one day seek professional counseling, or acupuncture or even just straightforward puncturing with a sharpened skewer. My main point is that if ever there came a time when you did spray your so called exciting fire suppressant foam into the mouth or the fundament of a fiery serpent. Why laying me upon the line, I would certainly be pro fuse in my thanks and would Upon my return to the Mercy Home for abandoned infants made of wood hold urgent discussions with the Beagle to arrange for you to be properly rewarded, perhaps with a lemon marang pie or a box of paper clips. I am confident that all my wouldn't fellows would do the same. So I can only assume when you assert that it is rare for you to be thanked or rewarded for your efforts that the wooden children you have assisted in the past must hail from some other home for wooden children, perhaps one that Nestle's even deeper in these deepened gloomy woods, a home where the wooden children are, God forbid skittish wooden in grades. I hope you will see fit to publish this letter or even read it out on the radio, and thus to set the record straight, passionately yours, a nameless wooden child.

Scholars, theologians and indeed plain old book lovers have long been intrigued by various anomalous additions of the Holy Bible. And in this new series, hooting yards own expert on such matters. Fatima Gilley, Blatt will be examining some of her favorites. Fatima was meant to read this herself but she was unable to make it today song Actually, she wrote this I'll have to read it. She begins with a rare Bible from 1982. The so called Emperor Roscoe Bible of 1982 is astonishingly rare. In fact, some people who want to know better have suggested that it's a figment of my own fancy, such accused as a hothead unfit to lick my theological booties, and should be discouraged from making any pronouncements upon these matters whatsoever. At least until such time as they have been forced to memorize all 89 chapters of the Codex, Gilly bland Tiana wherein I expand my learning with Verve and wit. I've recommended as suitable holiday reading if you have a suitcase big enough to contain it. But enough of self advertisement. The Emperor Roscoe Bible is so called because the four gospels in the New Testament were comprehensively rewritten. Excuse me by a quartet of clapped out radio one disc jockeys, including the eponymous Emperor Roscoe, Matthew, Ed stewpot, Stuart, Mark, Dave Lee Travis, otherwise known at least by himself and his immediate family as the Harry cornflake, Luke, and finally, did he David Hamilton, john, the remainder of the New Testament and all of the Old Testament follows the standard do I version, except for the book of Isaiah, which has been expunged for no apparent reason. My copy is bound in blood stained bandages, abstracted from a locker in the basement of a mysterious clinic high in the Swiss Alps. Only eight copies of the Emperor Roscoe Bible were ever made, and they were given away as prizes as a radio one roadshow held in the North Yorkshire seaside town of Whitby. The combination of the bloodstains on the bandages and the resonance of Bram Stoker's Dracula that still hangs over Whitby, I find strangely appealing.

more books now. This is like the Bible, which is a real book, bring forth devil your Elks is the title of a history of hunting in Finland. noted in the latest issue of the splendidly named periodical books from Finland, you can look that up if you don't believe me. Interestingly, the out of print pamphleteer Dobson once planned a series of best theories for children, to which he gave almost identical titles. They included bring forth the devil your moose, bring forth devil, your stormy petrels, and bring forth devil your common houseflies. Unlike the recent finished volume, none of Dobson's works ever saw the light of day, they abandoned the writing of them, when it was pointed out to him that he could make more money by churning out a potboiler about decorative cart cardigan buttons, a subject on which he was an acknowledged expert. Unfortunately, a glut of decorative cardigan button books appeared on the market, just as Dobson was finishing his manuscript. his money making scheme shattered the pamphlets he was forced to take a job as a janitor at an evaporated milk factory. But as we now know, this experience was pivotal in his pamphleteering career. And for further reading, there's an article Dobson's pivotal experience as a janitor at an evaporated milk factory by Petula Clark in the Journal of evaporated milk studies. Volume 46. Number seven, out of print.

That's almost the end of the show. And I'd like to end as often with a quotation This is from Harriet Prescott's, Crawford's novel, Moonstone mass, wonderful and mighty beings, old as the everlasting hills, destitute of mortal sympathy, cold and inscrutable, handling the two edged javelins of frost and magnetism and served by all the unknown polar agencies with their phantasmagoria they shot and hemmed me in and watched me rise like a worm.
