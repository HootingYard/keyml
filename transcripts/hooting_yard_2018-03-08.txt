Good evening and welcome to hooting yard on the air. My name is pansy cradle do and as a break with our scheduled programming and to observe International Women's Day. I'm going to be hosting a half hour of the women of hooting yard. hooting yard has been populated by spirit intelligent and independent women's since it started many years ago. And none more so than the subject of my first choice of readings for you tonight. This is a taken from the introduction to the book of gnats and is a description of the the author of that mod club. I do have to say a quick shout out here to Roberta mock of the massacre anthologies. It was thanks to Roberta publishing this that we even have it so thank you very much Roberta for putting that out sometime in the last millennium. So here we go with an excerpt from the introduction to the book of Nats. Originally published by wack and rather limited in 1926. The Book of NATS was written by the noted Aviatrix and explore mod glubb 1873 to 98 1858. Sorry, that's 1958. I think he worked that out. Well known for her countless newspaper articles, travelogues and often indiscreet prefaces to other people's books. glubb wrote this her only work of fiction by the spluttering light of blubber candles during the ill starred builds grew Antarctic expedition of 1911 Captain Jabez bills to guru of the Royal scrofulous for SARS, was according to the direct Dictionary of national biography, perhaps the most incompetent person ever to lead a polar expedition. On the very day the explorers set out from the sprightly little club port of mobster bilge group burned all the charts broke the compass contaminated the pemmican supply and blinded the medical officer at the Commission of Inquiry held in 1913. Upon the expeditions return, he first insisted that these were unfortunate accidents, later changing his story under cross examination to prove that he was only trying to run a tight ship and to instill a sense of discipline into his crew. The full story of the disastrous expedition is told incur winds polar habitude to the end of the earth with a half wit, to which the reader is referred. glob herself did not return to her homeland until 1919, for reasons which remains shrouded in mystery. Some reports have her leading rebel troops in the 10th horrobin revolution of 1915. But these are unsubstantiated. Love herself never spoke of this missing period in her life. Her biographer gravel slobber, despite years of prodigious research finally conceded that we are unlikely ever to learn precisely what happened to club during this period. slobber notes that the great athlete Aviatrix never intended the book of knots for publication. The manuscript was stored in a huge mahogany casket in the Belvedere of a country house, in which gloves friend laburnum Valles, worked as a piano tuner. Interviewed shortly before her death in 1968, bail said that the text would have remained forever locked away had it not been for the intervention of crocus Slack, sister of the notorious publisher, Toad collector and sought wenceslaus slack like her brother crocus was both an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac. At a weekend party hosted by balzers employer, she jimmied open the casket and the mistaken assumption that it contained a hidden supply of negus. Finding instead the manuscript of the book of gnats, she stole it, and later passed it on to her brother in exchange for a creative Grog. Why was Wenceslas wack interested in a virtually illegible stack of pages, each one blackened by Baba smoke? Neither bales nor slobber can offer an adequate answer. Of course, glubb was a public figure, and the newspapers often carried reports of her latest exploits. But slack and rather limited had never published any fiction before. Those novel choke two years, they had gained a reputation for issuing only ecclesiastical tracks, bell ringing manuals and massive erudite unreadable, multivolume works on the obscure byways of ik theology.

Whatever his reasons, swac wrote to clubs seeking her permission to publish. By return of post, he received an extraordinary reply, thanking him profusely commending his almost superhuman literary judgment, allowing him to edit the manuscript as he saw fit, and instructing him to pay all the author's royalties to a charitable institution for retired skin divers. glubb always insisted that this letter was a forgery, and she pursued flack through the courts. In February 1928, two years after the book was published, she won her case, flak and rudders. Remaining stock was pulped, and glove herself employed a private detective named Dobson, to track down and destroy all other copies of the book. Unless your man would have blanched at the prospect, but not Dobson. Within hours of accepting the job he burgled the publishers offices coming away with sales, Ledger's files, invoices, receipts and threatening letters. His agents fanned out across the country, burning down bookshops, terrorizing librarians and breaking into houses at the dead of night. They staked out junk shops, bazaars and jumble sales. week by week, Dobson stuck pins into the enormous map on the wall of his office. As more and more copies were traced, purloined ignited and obliterated. He sent to club regular monthly reports detailing his successes, setbacks near misses and red herrings when her money ran out, and she could no longer pay him. Dobson finance the operation himself. By November 1934, the task was complete FLAC and rather had printed 10,000 copies of the book of nuts, and there were 10,000 pins in Dobson's map. A Celebration fireworks party was held glob and Dobson personally thanking all the agents who had been so unstinting in their efforts, as they sipped cocktails and exchanged anecdotes. reliving the high points of the great pursuit. One agent remained strangely quiet, preoccupied. NET mud bag harbor the terrible doubt. One morning in July 1931. Waking up in a grim Hotel in Pugwash, magna mud bag had an attack of the jangles he was barely able to make it to the lobby. The standard procedure with his jangles was to send dogs in a coded telegram, explaining that the agent would be out of action for a couple of days. Dobson was an understanding man. Usually he would arrange for a bouquet of distortions to be delivered, accompanied by a sympathetic note. On the other hand, if for any reason, there was a particular urgency in the case, he would have another agent move in flame thrower out the ready. That hot and agonizing morning mode back had not sent a telegram. Instead, his brain befuddled, he subcontracted the work to a complete stranger he met on the pavement outside the hotel. It was madness. It was contrary to all his instructions to everything Dobson had ever taught him. Three years on poor mud bag could still not understand what on earth had made him do it. Yes, the stranger had seen trustworthy. Yes, he had cradled mud bag in his arms and helped him back up to his room. Yes, he had spoon fed him custard and marked his fevered brow. But there was no excuse and mud bag knew it, and he had never had the courage to admit what he had done. The worst thing was the nagging doubt, he could never be absolutely certain that the copy of the book he was tracking that day had actually been destroyed. Ironically, in view of what happened, the stranger was trustworthy. He listened attentively as mud bag baffled the details of the task at hand. He swore that he would tell no one and he never did. He even gave away the crumpled banknote which mud bag thrust into his hands as payment to a pockmarked mendicant loitering outside the hotel. The stranger had only one flaw. He was severely myopic. He nearly missed the library entering the municipal bus by mistake, but a passing Jesuit steered him in the right direction. After an hour of squinting and paring along the shelves, the stranger located the book or so he supposed definitely sealing it under his Macintosh walked out of the library caught a bus to the town dumb and unnoticed by the superintendent tossed it on to a blazing bonfire. The stolen tome was a 1912 reprint of shman Labs,

Unknown Speaker  10:15
the ambiguity of indigestion. And so the sole surviving copy of the book of gnats remained unbar owed on the shelves of the Pugwash Magna Public Library until 1952 when it was withdrawn from stock and donated together with from 40 other books to the cardinal pre Mercy Home for demented poppers. When that institution was closed down in 1966. Its library was auctioned off. And the book of NATS was part of a job lot bought by Grimes Pew, a secondhand book dealer with a shop in hooting yard. Pew died in 1973 and his business was taken over after much wrangling by Dr. f. x. duggleby, MD, who had been struck off the medical register in the same year for the illicit prescription of nose drops. dugald Lee's new career as a bookseller was not a success, and on New Year's Eve 1976 he closed up the shop drank four pints of stouts in a seedy tavern, threw himself into a canal and drowned. The shop was boarded up and the property condemned. Three days before demolition, a big van pulled up outside and took away the mildewed and rotting books which were piled in tottering heaps in the storeroom. Most of the stock ended up in a furnace, but sharp eyed scavengers plucked out a few books that were still salvageable. The Book of gnats was one of them. Eventually buy who knows what twists and turns, it found its way to a charity shop and pancakes. Were on the 14th of January 1987. I bought it for tuppence. When some weeks later I read the book I was thunderstruck. It seemed to me to be a work of art of the highest quality, tantalizing, majestic, profound and valiant. Since that first delirious reading, I have not shifted one jot from my opinion. At that time, I did not know the curious history of Mark Grubbs masterpiece, but it did not take me long to discover that the book was long out of print, and unknown to seemingly all my literature and well read cronies who are legion. I should explain that I like once a sauce slack and a publisher. I think it was during the fall autumn of 1988 that I decided to issue a new edition of the book of gnats. The previous summer had seen two of my titles selling unexpectedly high quantities and for once I was flush with money. I envisaged a deluxe edition bound in some exotic and possibly illegal in animal hide with a cover designed by the noted guasha scrimmage our a learned introduction by myself and an exhaustive commentary by gloves biographer slobber I am a woman of considerable integrity, and I did not wish to 10th the fate of wax addition by neglecting to seek permission from the copyright holders.

Like most people, I was aware that mod club had met her death on the sixth of February

Unknown Speaker  13:31
1958. She had accompanied the Busby Babes to their European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade. And on the return journey, she perished along with the flower of postwar British football in the Munich air disaster. apocryphal it may be, but I have heard that sir Matt Busby's first words after the crash on coming to the hospital ward were glub glub glub glub had died intestate, and she had no close relatives. The lawyers discovered that she appeared to have no distant relatives either. Despite the publicity surrounding her death and a series of public announcements, notices in the press and radio bulletins, no one ever came forward to lay claim to her estate. No one that is except painted paitent frauds, such as a 12 year old boy from Idaho named Biff for chump or something like that, who was swiftly revealed to be the victim of an experiment in mesmerism. His actions controlled by a sinister mastermind bent on world domination. This shadowy figure was apprehended and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, Biff or chump freed from his intransparent returned to Idaho and when last heard of was a soda jerk, although quite what such a trade involves is not known to me Control of clubs literary estate fell by who knows what arcane legal mechanism into the hands of a Dutch businessman named Leon vendo strawbe. There, I have written down the name of the monster who has reduced my life to misery. And worse, far worse, has deprived the world of the opportunity to read the book of nuts in its entirety. The three fragments left to research this essay forms an introduction are all that remain of this work of towering genius? How so? Read on, and I will tell you now, obviously, I don't have time to read on but readers who are interested in reading those excerpts are directed to hooting yd.org where they can find the full remaining text of the book have nots.

Unknown Speaker  16:15
I had to do that listeners I've been provided with a bell I'm not entirely sure for what purpose but it sounds nice. Mr. Key wanted me to point out to interested listeners that Dobson mentioned in that story, that's the detective that was hired by the publisher to destroy the books is not to be confused with Dobson our beloved out of print pamphleteer. And of course, you one cannot mention Dobson without mentioning marigold to Dobson's cherished one, who, although not a terribly independent character, is certainly one of the those people who's instrumental behind the scenes. She's been noted several times to fit say, I think you better write a pamphlet on that subject Dobson. The other thing to be said by about miracle she was that she's one of the only people who understands Dobson's terrible fear of squirrels. When asked about this, her only response was, it's those tails, those bushy, bushy tails. I'd like to move on though to another story. And this speaks about a famous balletto main. That's Nan Q. I have been commissioned to write the life of the balletto main Nan Q. I'll say it again. I have been commissioned to write the life of Nan que the balletto main. Now never having written a life before I don't know what to do. I have no idea how to set this life in train. I only know one thing about Nan que for certain, and that is that her eyes are blue. I have been advised by a tip top biographer of many persons of the past that I will have to talk to people she knew. But apparently nearly all her surviving pals live abroad in Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain. Summer even as far flung as Peru. I do not even own a passport, as I have always found travel to be an unbearable strain. I am reluctant even to travel by train. Call me unadventurous, but I stick to my familiar surroundings like blue. I would much rather sit fast than board one of those gigantic lumps of metal they call an aeroplane. An added problem is that everything I have written to date has been fiction. But of course, every last detail of this life has to be true, that much as plain. She had, though a very long life. So there are many facts upon which to choose. After doing a bit of research, I can add to the color of her eyes that she was a Jew, and that she had a pet dog a Great Dane. Other than that, so far, I haven't got a clue. It would help if I knew something about the ballet to, but nothing bores me to tears as much as prancing ninnies in a tutu. If you buy a ticket for the ballet, you may as well pour your money down the drain. That's my view. The sole reason I agreed to write this life was the prospect of financial gain. I accepted an advance. So I suppose that if I don't produce a manuscript, the publishers will sue That would be a pain. Last time I was threatened with legal action I spent six months hiding in a zoo. Granted as a solution to my problems, it was not entirely sane. I pretended to be a veterinary surgeon there to care for pregnant knew. One day my cover was blown and I saw some coppers approach and I ran off down a lane. Just my luck I was set upon by a roughy and crew. There bashings to my head did something untoward to my poor brain. That was not the end of my worries, because after that, I caught the flu. And I had a migraine and I had a stone in my shoe. And then I was drenched by rain. Somehow, I managed to hobble into a church, where I collapsed onto a pew. I let out a little gasp of relief. Few too soon for that I noticed that in my collapse, I had cut myself

Unknown Speaker  21:05
and blood was pouring from a vein. I rummaged in my pocket for a jar of wound soothing glue. It was an ointment containing linseed and mugwort and feverfew Oh, and with a smidgen of henbane. As I smeared the wound, I heard the uncanny rattling of a chain, trust my lack or lack of it, to have taken shelter in a church that had been de consecrated and was now used for purposes new. In this case, the rehearsal of a ballet King Jasper's castle, its electrical wiring systems, its janitor, and it shot Elaine. I could not help wondering if it was a ballet Nan q had seen and favored with a review. For at some point within all the legal shenanigans and hiding out, I had discovered something else about the balletto mean that she wrote a column for a ballet journal. And the more she wrote, the more her reputation grew. I had found in an archive, a bound copy of this journal, and had a read through God, it was boring. I won't do that again. She communicated her enthusiasm for the ballet, with a lot of verbal pyrotechnics and ballyhoo. And it seemed to me she stuck to received wisdom. There was nothing she wrote about that went against the grain. Not that I know anything about ballet, that's true. But it occurred to me that if I was going to write this life, now I knew from where to take my cue, I could bulk it out with quotes from man, and who would spot them I mean, who, in the unlikely event that some ballet natter did, I was sure I could think of a way to explain, and a combination of plagiarism and controversy could prove a heady brew, at least from the publishers point of view, who knows what a huge amount of sales my life might attain? I might even earn back the advance that was my do. I envision the launch of the life and outside the bookshop in enormous queue. My attention suddenly reverted to the ballet rehearsal in the deconsecrated church, where they were trying out an exciting scene in which King Jasper's slain, so complicated as the choreography that one cannot tell if he is killed by the janitor or the shadow lane. I am more used to pantomime so when the culprit was revealed I gave a great history and a boo, at which point the ballet dancers withdrew. Fool that I am my hissing boo had revealed my presence to the Rafi and crew. They came crashing through the church door, armed to the teeth, demented and insane, but hot on the heels came the coppers so fast, they almost flew in the confusion and brouhaha I managed to flee. But my flight proved to be just another turn of the screw. I ran slap bang into the side of a huge metal crane. I was taken to a clinic where clinicians prodded my brain. When I woke up, they said we have some news for you. I wondered if they were going to tell me I'd gone cuckoo, and that in so many words was true. They said you have an arrangement of the brain. You are in no fit state to write the life of Nan q the ballot domain as if to prove their point I asked who they said that I let her mean. Nan que Well, I had hoped to read many more stories to you. But unfortunately our time is growing short. It's sad to me that I've missed who wrote the one who is perhaps my favorite character and I know, beloved of many other listeners and that's of course tiny Enid. The plucky clubfoot tart. She counts hanggliding hot air ballooning, pole vaulting and daring undersea rescues among her accomplishments, and was once known to have rescued some ducks for the toxic puddle. There are of course other women who are in hooting yard who are slightly less reputable but no less interesting. To have these that stand out to me are popsie van Straub and see the floozy who went on to run a stamp collecting club in a mountain sanatorium and poopsie Clutterbuck, the flopper who was allergic to plant pianos, and of course there's the ever present Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman, the psycho magical being who dwells in a dilapidated cottage in a large word, and is known for turning into a crow before kissing you one night in the word. I think we may have time though, for a quick, a quick look at the odd dots. Oddly, I can find no Wikipedia entry for the botsman dots. odd because they are without question the most important dots of the past 100 years. They are of course odd in themselves. botsman always referred to them as odd dots, leaving it to the wider world to dump them with his own name. botsman was by no means a modest man, but he had his moments of difference, and the act of nomenclature was one of them. Watson is thought to have named the dots after dark tint bluestocking, sister of the noted message and test wrecks tent. In a particularly hectic 20th century year botsman and Dart had a fling, and it was when they were holed up in a love nest in one of Ruskin's favorite Swiss villages. That botsman one snow bound and wintry evening, first conceived a few dots that would bring him fame. It is possible that the dots are not mentioned by the Wikipedia for security reasons. After all, it is their military applications that have changed the world. These were not foreseen by botsman, who was on record as stating that, initially, at least, he considered the dots of most benefit to gardening enthusiasts, Potter's and hikers. It may have been dot 10 herself, who, recognizing the dots versatility, sent a sketch of them to a bigwig at a top secret intelligence facility. In interviews later in life, she denied having done so and is perhaps one for the historians to Winkle out now that botsman doctrine and indeed the military big wake are all doornail dead and have long since fed the worms in their respective burial grounds. And with that, listeners, I'd like to leave you with one final small quote. This is from Vitaly queef Rambo, the mother of the French poet. In 1906, Madame Rambo wrote to her daughter, I am not writing to wish you a good New Year. It's few title, actions are everything. With that, thank you very much. Happy International Women's Day. and good evening from hooting yard.
