Good evening This is resonance while 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Sorry, I wasn't here last week, but I'm back this week. And we're going to continue as we have been this year with various people's diary entries. And this is from the 15th of January 1913. I think or no? Well, yes. 1913 and it's the diary of Ford Maddox unstrap. Bernard Taub. I goggled you gargled. He she or it gargled, we gargled, you lock gargled, they gargled. That was the gargling done, and it remained only to read gargle before getting down to the lessor business of the day, the gargling and re gargling, being, of course, the main business on this day, as on every day in the current dispensation. I know for a fact that some queer folk like to gargle with stuff that comes prepared in bottles available from the chemist shop, such as Dr. Baxter's Zippy fragrant spitting fluid, I aboard those concoctions. I make my own a mixture of ice cold water scoop from the duck pond, table salt, crushed violet vinegar and goatee milk. The precise quantities of each ingredient I measure out in my so called gargling jar, which in truth is just an ordinary job with horizontal lines scratched on the side with the sharpened ends of a pair of sugar tongs. It has served me well these 40 years. And well I hope continue to do so for as many more years as the Lord sees fit in his ineffable wisdom to ground me. Not that I'm a religious man. pious, yes, religious No. If there is a lord, then he is a phantom in my head lodged somewhere between the brain and the skull forever eluding the forceps of inquiry. I must admit that there are days when having gargled and re goggled. I find myself something of a loose end. On occasion, I throw caution to the winds and repair to the bathroom to gargle one more time. spellbinding as this can be I know it only staves off the inevitable, which is to buckle down to all those non gargling activities with which I'm afflicted. On any given day these might include not gargling taking a constitutional around and round The flowerbeds, scooping water from the duck pond. plucking then crushing violence, milking several goats. resisting the temptation to read gargle, firing off a letter to the editor of the gargling Gazette. shimmying up and down rope ladder as part of military training for a war I am convinced will never come. dispensing arms to beggars and widows and orphans communing with my spirit guide hoopla polishing the gargling jaw and writing in a crabbed and barely legible hand in my diary. Today I did some of these things not others, but with a heavy heart. I felt drawn irresistibly to the bathroom sink to gargle again, though I knew it was madness.

dr. Baxter himself in spite of his Zippy potion, warns against the dangers of over gargling in a pamphlet distributed by an urchin in the village square. I do not think the urgyen receives a farthing for his labors come rain or shine he stands there. We then disease ridden handing out pamphlets to passers by sickness of the brain brought on by more gargling that is wise and proper. of the words emblazoned on the cover, below which appears a mezzotint by the noted mezzotint is Rex tinte, showing a horrifying brain sick mad person in the throes of unreason. lot is dr. Baxter at one of the same time, manufacture and sell his spitting fluid, while dissuading people from wishing to purchase it. The only reason I can think of is that he is brain sec himself, perhaps from over gargling my own head it must be said, or the brain inside it has not yet succumb to lunacy. I feel my Phantom Lord nestled within would tell me where it so he said nothing today, which I count as a perk. And so, to cop.

We move on now to the art of print pamphleteer Dobson. And this is we find him in 1961. On the 17th of January 1961. On his travels, woke up without the faintest clue where I was, it rapidly became apparent that I was zipped up tight in a sleeping bag. When I struggled out of it, I saw I was in a tent. I have absolutely no memory of going camping. In any case, I hate camping. In my experience, one finds that wherever one pictures one's tent soon becomes a haven for moles. You fall asleep on a flat patch of ground and when you wake up, the entire area is riddled with mole hills. Usually. That was not the case today. As I discovered when emerging through the canvass flats, I found that the tent had been erected within a hotel room. This was a curious occurrence To be sure, and I ransacked my memory to work out why it might be so was I so bent on travel that I had to double the experience as it were, first booking into our hotel and then pitching a tent within it. It is something I've done only once before, when I was young and foolish. Now I am old and wise, at least by my own reckoning. I polluted in the on suite bathroom and pranced out into the corridor in search of breakfast. I noticed something decidedly odd about the sausages and the cornflakes and beckoned a hotel person. finding myself inexplicably bereft of speech. I pointed at the sausages and the cornflakes and raised a quizzical eyebrow. The explanation I was given for the oddness of my sausages and cornflakes sent my brain reeling. Not only was my tent in a hotel room, but the hotel was on a space rocket. I was hurtling unimaginable speed towards a distant planet. And I could not speak because of what the hotel person who I noticed had special breathing apparatus attached to a tin foil helmet called space muffling. I had been planning to take a walk in the grounds of the hotel after breakfast, but clearly this was not feasible. So I returned to my room and Once inside, crept back through the flaps into my tent. I set up a portable ESP revoir took out my drawing pattern propelling pencil and said about writing a pamphlet. Space Age Dobson I decided to entitle it immodestly. Shortly after I had scribbled my opening sentence and was chewing the end of my propelling pencil trying to think of a second sentence, the captain made an announcement over the space Tannoy crew to the wrong sort of particles in the galaxy, we would have to turn back and return to Earth. I scribbled out my title in my opening sentence and continued to true the end of the propelling pencil, which tasted remarkably similar to both the sausages and the cornflakes. we bumped back to Earth about half an hour later, I disembarked and made my way home by bus. I told my enamorado marigold true all about my excursion. You will never much of a traveler Dobson. She said you Why'd you get upset about moles? That gave me an idea for a pamphlet? And I repaired immediately to my escritor where I wrote in one sitting by pamphlet. Are there any moles in outer space? No, there are not out of print.

Another writer's diary this time, and this is the best selling paperback is pebble head. Writing in 1992. To the launch party for my new paperback potboiler Mabel Mabel Mabel Mabel, Mabel, Mabel, Mabel Mabel. I took the title from Ronald furbank 1916 novel inclinations. And I'm pleased to think that this may be the first time in the history of fiction than an entire chapter of an existing work has been quoted as the title of a new one. It was chapter 20. For anybody who wants to check. My Mabel bears scant resemblance to furbank. She was young and not a little ditzy. While mine is a Crone. In fact, for a while I thought of giving the books the title, Crone with a sponge. Until about halfway through, I encountered intractable technical pop boiler difficulties, and had to ditch the sponge entirely. eradicating all mention of it from the opening chapters. It is I think, a better book as a result, certainly a better potboiler. I attended the launch party, incognito, got up as a baffle bus conductor down on his luck. My disguise was almost totally successful. And not even my own mother recognized me. What on earth she was doing at the party is a surpassing mystery. I must have words with the warden at the bewilderment home. though nobody actually knew me for who I am. One fat head mistook me for the lumbering, psychopathic walrus mustache serial killer babinski and called the couple's by arrived just as I was cramming cream crackers from the buffet into the pocket of my bus conductors jacket. Never overlook free cream crackers, by the way, follow that advice, and you could sail through life more or less unhindered. Not so this evening. Alas, as the coppers led by Dowty, Detective Captain Kirk pan whacked me on the head several times with a lead weighted SAP, removed the cream crackers from my pocket and put them back on the buffet table and bundled me into the back of their van. I assumed I would be taken down to the station, but instead, we drove out into the blasted and inhospitable winter countryside. At a godforsaken spinny the van screech to a halt, and the cop has dragged me out and tied me to the trunk of a yew tree. The ukri pointed up, it had a gothic shape. My eyes lifted after it and found the moon I noticed that fumi Spiritist mist inhabited this place, and there was a row of headstones. I've decided the only way to stop you babinski is to engage in a spot of extra glue digital killing said card pan. Then, Ned get the axe in the shovel he added to one of his henchmen. But I am not babinski I cried. I am the best selling paperback just pebble head. Prove it. Said kargh pan darkly. My hands are tied to the trunk of this pointy you tree so I cannot rummage in my pocket. But if you do so, in among the crumbs of cream crackers. You will find my gutter in Richard jotted down notes for my next half dozen best selling paperback pop boilers, I said. kaag pan rummaged and a look of wonderment lit up his countenance. Bloody hell, boys. This isn't babinski it's pebble Hey He cried, and he immediately freed me from my bonds and sat, sat me down on a camping stool and gave me a cup of tea from a flask. We're all big fans of yours, he said, as his little band of coppers all nodded. We've got every single one of your books down at the station. If we take you back there, will you sign them for us? Of course I will. I said. If afterwards, you will return me to the launch party for Mabel Mabel Mabel Mabel Mabel, Mabel Mabel. Better than that said cargo van will throw a party for you ourselves. I don't know if you've ever been to a coppers party, Mr. P, but we can guarantee you a splendid time.

And so it turned out that I ended the evening absolutely stuffed with cream crackers, wearing a paper hat and regaling a basement full of coppers with pecan anecdotes of the literary life. More to the point I gathered invaluable material for my forthcoming best selling paperback potboiler tied to a you free by coppers working title, which I should have finished by late tomorrow afternoon

20th of January 1900 I am a pimply ragamuffin of no great consequence in this world. But my doings will resound down the ages and be pored over by generations yet unborn because I am keeping this diary. And that intervals every 100 pages or so, I put the scribble treats into a bag and the bag into the sack and the second to a box and the box I bury in a field in different fields dotted his and scissor where one day in the future a man wielding a spade or a shovel will dig up my diary and it will be pulled over, as I said just now by generations yet unborn. First listen first thing this morning, I gazed into the greasy glass and counted my pimples. There is a different number every day, which I'd jot down in a separate notebook. It seems that overnight, while I lie on my straw pallet in the corner of the barn thrashing about fast asleep yet disturbed by terrible dreams. Several pimples erupt and several others subside or vanish. Sometimes I trace the patterns they form on my way colored face, just in case like the constellations of stars in the sky, there is a message to be read in them. I have buried some of my pimple diagrams alongside my diary pages. So perhaps in the future, a significance I cannot fathom will be apparent to those who come after me, armed as they may be with a greater knowledge of patterns and mysteries and pimple distribution. Then I took my begging bowl and sat on a clump by a verge and hoped for arms. A passing person gave me an old hold woolen sock to serve as a mitten for my tiny frozen hand. Oddly, both of my hands are on pimpled. Another passing person had no matching sock Alas, but did give me a bar of soap. But today I had chosen the wrong clump or the wrong verge or both because nobody else passed all day long. Towards sunset I trudged off to Brentwood to see my one POW. The Mad old gent with the Old Testament beard, demented ravings, I keep meaning to transcribe but I will need a different notebook different from my diary notebooks in my pimple count notebook. Perhaps I will be able to get one in exchange for the bar of soap from a filthy stationer. As I approached Brentwood, skirting the reservoir, and passing the waterfall and the harbor, weather jumping, Jenny was tied to a painter and the House and the slight seat facing the tumbling stream. I sent something I miss my pimples grew hot, a sure sign of impending calamity. And indeed, as I came to the house, out of it emerged a black clad fellow with a grave look upon his countenance. Who exclaimed Mr. Raskin, he did.

Here is the new booth right here writing on the on the on the 21st of January 1918 Lytton came to tea stated dinner, and about 10 o'clock. We both had that feeling of Park clips and use that vivacity which comes from hours of talk. But listen was most easy and agreeable. Among other things, he gave us an amazing account of the British sex society, which meets at Hampstead. They were surprisingly Frank and 50 people of both sexes and various ages discussed without shame. such questions as the deformity of Dean swift penis, whether cats use the WC self abuse, incest, I think of becoming a member. Litton that different points exclaimed, penis, his contribution to the openness of the debate. We also discuss the future of the world, how we should like professions to exist no longer kete old age, politics. Bloomsbury hypnotism, a great many subjects

who would have thought that the British sex society would meet at Hampstead? I mean, there's a surprise. And this is a diary of a crow. You might be surprised that a crow could keep a diary but they're very very intelligent bird crows. This is a diary of a crow from January 1970. Woke up in a foul temper. I was really really pissed off, sat atop a tree and shouted my head off. I was still pissed off, but I went down to the car park to meet my crow pals. We started about intimidating smaller birds, and indeed anybody else we came upon. Later, I went to sit atop a tree just outside mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire did a bit of queueing spotted a bloke with a notepad and pen who seemed to be jotting down my cause. I wasn't having that. So I swooped down and had a quick slasher his face with my talents. by Eric, he cried, after you've drawn blue crow. Just like the first time I kissed my poor wife Sylvia, dead by our own and the seven years. Then he added blogger on barlaam floor in real August. I didn't realize darkness had opened its womb. But looking around I saw Knight was falling. So I headed for a different tree and shouted my head off for a while because I was still in a foul mood. Then I fell asleep

fine ladies I think this will probably be finally, this week or the diary of Captain nitti. From the 28th of January 1954. Last night it was my turn on duty for the nocturnal pig walk. brandishing my owl punch doc I sent out across the top pooter as night came crashing down some sides and affectation of mine to use a Swiss stick design for mountainous terrain when crossing the flat wild, bleak, desolate, windswept tar pooter perhaps it is, but I never leave home without my alpins doc these days. Some say also, Why are there no Twilight anymore? No dusks. And it's true that nowadays day turns to night and the seeming instant. I cannot account for this. So I do not try to conjecture would prove fruitless I fear and would make no difference. The fact is, as I grabbed hold of my our punch doc and open the door, there was daylight. And then I stepped out and I said pulled the door shut behind me. So it was night. Night, the time when we must keep watch for pigs. It has not always been so years ago, if you can believe it. There was not even a nocturnal pig observatory on the top pooter apparently, people used to just turn down the light in their huts and chalets and lie down in their beds and sleep on troubled sleep. It's hard to credit is it not? Yet it was so where the nocturnal pig observatory now stands. A triumph of filigree in cement, as it has been described, was nothing more than a stretch of flat wild, bleak, desolate, windswept tar pooter identical to the flat while bleak, desolate, windswept tar pooter surrounding it on all sides as far as the eye can bear to see. hammering on the door with my owl punch Doc, I summon the duty peg observer whose shift was an end. He handed me the cap and the dockets and flips and flaps and scrubbies unfold his umbrella and headed out across the night black top pooter I settled myself at the console and adjusted the pig scanner. There was a Pong from the oil heater, but at least I was warm. outside. The wind was howling, and the stars were quivering in the heavens. I thought of beer pint poem, wobbly stars. And so I gazed, I gaze now at the monitors now out through the reinforced plexiglass pig proof window. I saw no pigs. It was a small mercy. But we must snatch it small mercies and cuddle them close and cherish them. For not all Knights are piglets on the flat, wild, bleak, desolate, windswept top pooter.

And that's, that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. There might be there might be more diary entries. But having done the entire month of January on the hooting yard blog at hooting yard.org with daily diary entries from the great and the good, and the not so good and the non existent. Amazing. Give that a break and go back to just random stuff we shall see. Anyway, I'll be back with more stuff for you next week. Hope you have a nice time. Bye bye
