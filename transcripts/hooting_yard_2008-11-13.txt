Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Last week, I read a piece and after reading it, I added some of the comments that were made when the piece appeared on my website, hooting ard.org a comment from a reader fitzmorris trenary and he made mention in those comments of fruiter is adhesive. This reminded me of a little known story that's told about tiny Enid, in which the plucky clubfoot had taught, devised a method of placating wolves through the agency of fruit based gas sprays. Yes, yes, I know that a gas spray is a different order of thing to a fruit or as adhesive. But given that most fruits are as gums and pastes are made from mashed bananas and the pulp of tangerines, and that tiny Enid gas spray was formed, at least in part by a gas derived from the pulp of bananas and mashed tangerines I think I'm pretty safe grounded forging the link the weird woods of Whoo hoo Dee Rudy Whoo, near where tiny Enid spent some time in a boarding house were infested with packs of theists and dangerous wolves packs which had savaged any number of innocent Woods hiking types, who blundered foolishly into the weird woods of a weekend. The heroic infant was not herself a hiking enthusiast, but she had a curious sentimental affection for hikers with their thick woolly socks and social ineptitude. alarmed by reports of wolf attacks, she took it into her head to do something about them. The attacks that is not the reports of the attacks. She sighed and left it to someone else to take on the task of correcting the slapdash grammar misspellings and vile prose in which the reports written by the cub reporter on the daily wolf attacks in the woods Clarion were couched tiny in its first impulse was to slaughter the wolves one by one in hand to pour combat, or with pebbles and a catapult or with her trusty blunderbuss. She had got as far as driving towards the weird woods in her souped up jalopy, flying a banner emblazoned with the words Death to the wolves in the woods doorbird in blood, when she had to break sharply and slew off bumpity bumpity bump into a field to answer an urgent message on her metal Tapping Machine. Tiny Enid was an independent sort of girl, but she had a mysterious mentor whose advice she often took. It was this mentor who suggested to her that rather than killing the wolf population, she instead seek a method of allocating them. I have no particular love for wolves came the tapped out message. But we must be ever mindful of biodiversity. Tiny Enid, the earth can support both wolves and hikers, just as it supports both fruit flies and fruit. The diminutive adventurist was not wholly convinced by this analogy, but on this occasion, she deferred to her mysterious mentor, possibly because she'd been reading up on the Gaia theories of James Lovelock, drawn to them by her interest in the primordial and Sonic deities of the ancient Greek Pantheon. Never forget that tiny Enid was a girl of broad education, even if the only book she ever learned by heart was Atlas Shrugged by the postage stamp collector Ayn Rand. faulty is the fruit and fruit fly analogy may have been it obviously set tiny Enid to thinking how fruit might help her placate the wolves of the weird woods. She turned her jalopy round and sped back to town to consult some encyclopedias in the library. Unfortunately, sick habit, Andy Burnham had got there before her, and the reference section had been turned into a chill out zone for feral teenagers. There was not an encyclopedia to be seen just games consoles and reconstituted patties of meeting bands. Tiny Enid felled a handful of us with pebbles fired from her catapult before heading off to the laboratory of her power Professor Fang, a man who knew a thing or two about fruit and wolves, as he knew about everything else in the universe. Everything that is except for hiking and thick woolly socks, for he was an indoor type. I want two things from you professor Fang announced tiny he needed no shrill shouty way. First up method of allocating balls with fruit and second,

a way of reprogramming the spongiform gray blob that passes for the brain of Andy Burnham, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport duties sick heavy ways. I've had to use my stock of pebbles just now and we'll have to waste precious time collecting further catapult ammo. Who knows how many hikers will be torn apart by wolves in the weird woods of Whoo hoo Dee woody Woo. While I'm scrabbling around at the allotment replenishing my pebble supply. Give me 15 minutes, replied Professor Fang. And so it was that in the time it would take to read a chapter of Atlas Shrugged, the Madcap boffin devised both the spray of banana pulp and mashed tangerine based gas with which tiny Enid was able to replicate the walls and a similar gas derived from tomatoes and conference pairs, which when injected into Andy Burnham's head through his ears would allow his brain pans to work properly. History and hikers hikers tell us that tiny Enid succeeded in becoming the wolves and making them less Savage. After the heroic club footed infant clumped from one end of the weird woods to the other spraying her gas, not a single hiker was ever attacked again. The Daily wolf attacks in the woods Clarion having no news to report was forced to close down and its cub reporter became a bitter enemy of tiny Enid feeding spurious stories about her to the independent on Sunday and other downmarket rags. Not only not that the tiny one cared for she was forever after the champion of Beardy men and batty women with maps in protective cellophane projects on lanyards, safe at last tramped through the weird woods of Whoo hoo de whoopty. Woo. As for the terrible tale of Andy Burnham's brain that's unsuitable for a family radio show. And we'll have to wait for another more ghastly time.

If he goes to the hooting our website which of course you should all do constantly, and you'll find a link somewhere to a very useful map of Liechtenstein, which shows the 11 enclaves some of which are possibly x claves. into which that tiny principality is dropped divided. And I'm gonna read you the list of the 11 enclaves, and my pronunciation may be completely askew, because I'm not entirely sure what the correct pronunciation of some of these is. to just have to bear with me. Anyway, the 11 enclaves of Liechtenstein are in alphabetical order. bows is eshan gan prime moren klinken rogol Sean Schellenberg, treason, treason Berg and Vaduz. Tiny Enid sorry, tiny Enid is sort of spent some time dwelling in a chalet in Cancun. Though no plaque or inscribed stone exists to mark what might after all, be just a rumor put about by those seeking to muddy the waters of the plucky tot biography. If a biography can be said to have waters, I shall have further words to say about those who sow confusion in the field of tiny Enid life studies shortly and they will be stern words sulfurous ones declined from a platform a platform I hope to erect in plank in itself, or failing that in shine or bow there's the platform will be made from expensive wood as you would expect, but the carpenters will be cheap. If I do my homework, which involves consulting a directory of Liechtenstein, Ian carpenters and other woodworkers and ranking them according to price. Such an activity could become the most anguished of souls.

In the words of the song, you've got to search for the hero inside yourself. Particularly if you're the sort of we the milk sock who gets sand kicked into your face by muscle bound beach bullies have pronounced homoerotic tendencies. The search for the hero must be addressed with rigor, and you must not allow yourself to be distracted. That's why you should immediately head off towards the June's and find a secluded nook where you can code your Tate uninterrupted. Take your towel with you and your picnic basket and the piccolo you brought to the beach with you to practice upon, and which was the cause of much cruel merriment to the bronze Hulk to kick sand in your face. But do not play your Piccolo in the Nook for your mellifluous if inexpert piping will betray your location. And it's imperative that you remain quiet alone during your search. It is of course a wholly cerebral search, one in which you must Marshal all your mental powers to find within yourself the heroic instinct. Shut your eyes and imagine you're a micro scopic being on an Isaac Asimov style Fantastic Voyage through your body, beginning at the top of your head and working your way slowly down to your tiptoes. Somewhere between the two you hope to find the hero. If you get all the way to your tiptoes without running it to ground. Work your way back upwards, making sure you examine every little cranny and hidey hole, particularly any that might be lurking in the vicinity of your liver or your kidneys. If even after the most tremendous searching, you have still not found the hero inside yourself. You must accept that you are indeed a weed and a milk SOP. The best thing to do is to slink away from the dunes and thus from the beach, and to continue your Piccolo practice elsewhere. For example, in a cupboard or on a deserted sea good at all. On the other hand, if you do find the hero inside yourself, open your eyes pick up your towel and your picnic basket and your Piccolo and prance back to the beach to confront the bare chested bullies. Wrap each of them on the nose with your Piccolo and then spit in their eyes and stamp upon their toes. Make sure you have a helicopter standing by to whisk you away as soon as you were done. And as you fly off into the sunset, laugh your head off and thumb your nose at your tormentors who will rapidly appear tinier and tinier as the chopper ascends until they're no bigger than ends and just as easily squashed. Now, I said that you've got to search for the hero inside yourself, particularly if you're a weed in a milk SOP. But clearly, you need not do any such thing. It's simply an example of the worst kind of aspirational pap peddled by pop singers and television programs and so called lifestyle magazines which besmirched the cultural landscape like so many contaminated puddles in which mutant aquatic beings slither and squirm and squirt toxic gag. You could argue that I'm over egging my metaphor, but to do so would suggest that there's such a concept as too many eggs, which, unless you're Alfred Hitchcock is absolute nonsense. Alfred Hitchcock, of course, was scared of eggs. Having the name of heaven could never have too many eggs. surplus ones can be placed in storage and used as and when they're required. Whether you're whipping up a tasty egg based recipe, or deploying a metaphor when wishing to execrate the twaddle threatens to engulf us all. Or one can distribute one spare eggs to paupers, a pauper with an egg is no less a pauper, of course, but better an egg in his hand than a bowl for begging. If you're really becoming overwhelmed with eggs and your chosen pauper looks halfway capable of poultry husbandry, you could even give one of your hens to him. At a stroke, you will have reduced the Pauper population by one for a hen owning person cannot properly be considered a pauper. As such, he has written to the status of a property owner. Though his property may be only a single scraggy hand, it is still property. Some are dismayed at the idea of treating even the least of God's creatures as objects of worth ownership. But that's the kind of sentimental drivel expounded by scruffy wasp rolls, who would have us living in the dark ages without antibiotics or indeed industry. surviving on berries and nuts and rainwater.

Such a prescription can appear attractive when under the onslaught of contemporary Pap, it's easy to imagine that one might live a more fulfilling life huddled in a cave snacking on almonds, instead of being bombarded by visions of cavorting, pop strolls, demanding that we search for the hero inside ourselves, or insisting that our hearts will go on. But remember, we can create a more lustrous path, one with the benefits of poultry ownership and antibiotics, and much much else besides. And as we make our way along that path, a basket of surplus eggs in one hand and a hand in the other. We should keep our eyes peeled for paupers crumpled in ditches along the way. paupers, which will raise out of papadum with gifts of eggs and a hand and also of any berries and nuts, some bottles of saved rainwater, we may be carrying in our capacious pockets.

A book like no other that ever will be as 20 brilliant acknowledgments from literary sovereigns expressly and by necessary implication agree, scintillating, fascinating, subtle, sincere, sublime, gorgeous, fantastic, exquisite, ambrosial, most soul compelling, so suggestive of still higher things, a glimpse into Ellucian mysteries are the literature of the planet Mars, like purple mountain peaks, rising above the clouds and disappearing and the whiteness of shrouds of mist. There is nothing like it in literature, and a splendid mind it is that goes flashing on through these pages. The abolition of your thoughts makes me feel as if I had been attracted to within a few hundred miles of the sun, and had his gas jets in full view. These measured statements appeared on the back cover of an 1895 book by George Winslow Pierce, entitled, my sound speed discovery, expanding into a constructive medley of Witten song being a four years after inflorescence of the life romance of an algebraic beast. But I think we can honestly say that such a matchless blurb applies equally well to gravitas, punctilious rectitude and Pipi bags, the new hooting yard paperback featuring 101 stories which is available now. Go to the hooting yard website. There's a picture of the cover, click on that and you'll find out how to buy it. Yes, so that was a blurb that was a blurb for the upcoming book. And this is a story called grave diggers Glade. There's a Glade in the woods where once grave diggers gathered have an evening when their days digging was done. And so it's known as grave diggers Glade. They came directly from their graveyard and brought their spades with them leaning the spades against the larches and lo Burnham's and Sycamores dotted the glade some came from graveyards far away, far too far to trudge on foot. And those grave diggers came on their donkeys with their spades tied to panniers. That can be something Christ like about a grave digger riding a donkey along a country line, particularly if he has a beard on a soulful look in his eyes and he's dressed in a white shift. But no competent Grave Digger wears white for grave digging is filthy work particularly during rainfall. It is work that throws up clods of Earth and mark with which the grave diggers clothing is splattered and so he will wear black or brown or beige and rather than a shift he will wear overalls are dungarees of tough cloth if he knows what he's about. Even a grave digger so clad if he has a beard and a soulful look in his window. He Why a Strider donkey towards the glade as the sunset can resemble Christ, however, if not quite so perfectly. What must a spectator make then have a continual stream of Christ's one after another in the evening on the lane as they head for their gathering in the glade. Some are on their donkeys and some are on foot, but even the latter can look like Christ during his passion, carrying this spades as Christ carried his cross was a sight indeed, and one you would have seen if, all those years ago, you'd been a peasant, tilling his patch beside the lane, or lolling in a haystack, knocking back a flag and of cider, or engaged in some other rustic evening pursuit. Thomas Hardy wrote about such things, but as far as I know, he never witnessed the parade of the grave diggers on their way to grave diggers Glade in the woods. These are not Wessex woods. There was little it was Christ like about their gatherings. They link their spades against the larger ism the Burnham's and Sycamores, and those who'd come far tied dead donkeys to the same trees with donkey tying string, so the donkeys would not stray, although they let their spades remain and planted, rather than removing them to lean against the trees alongside the spades of their fellows. No, they no longer looked Christ like as they gathered all in black and brown and beige and matted in muck, muck which was splattered in their beards and their hair as well as upon their tough grave diggers clothing.

And gathered together they began to grunt, like grunted softly and loudly and kept on grunting until they had coaxed the grunty. Man, that monster from the Bedtime Stories of their childhoods from his lair up in the hills. The grumpy man came bounding down to grave diggers Glade at inhuman speed, hairy and slobbering and grunting, and as soon as he was among them, the grave diggers fell silent. They stoop to pick pebbles from the ground, and they kept the pebbles at the grantee man, many, many pebbles, but not with great force, for they wish to tease him rather than to harm him. And when they had exhausted the pebbles, the grave diggers began to sing. They all had sheet music tucked into the pockets of their black and brown and beige overalls or dungarees, and they lined up as a choir would line up, and they belted out in their graph Grave Digger voices, selections from Charles Ives, his self published collection of 114 songs 1922 they sang at sea and Charlie Rutledge, and like a sick Eagle. They sang lochend work and grant Chester and if guralnick they sang songs my mother taught me and the Housatonic at Stockbridge, they sang Marie and Rosamond and mists and watchman and those evening bells, and they sang Tom sails away as a sort of farewell to the grunty man, for by now he had sailed or scampered away, for he was frightened of singing, and the Grave Digger songs always made him flee back up to the hills, where he cowered in his lair until noon, back to the glade by the grunting of the grave diggers. When next they gathered there have an evening fear stalks the countryside, especially fear of the grumpy man. And that is how the grave diggers held their fear at bay. They could have sung songs by other composers, of course by Schubert or Schumann or Peter Warlock or Peter blegh hvad or Yoko Ono, but each of them was fond of Ives, and they had splurged their wages on the sheet music for the 114 songs, trooping into dentists pig straws sheet music shop in the village of CAC, posing as a choir. All singing, terrified the grantee man, teasingly pelted with pebbles and sang at he never learned that he should ignore the grunting with which he was coaxed from his layer, for his brain was tiny and hot and pitiable. And every single evening he fell for the same trick. Have it happened in Wessex, Thomas Harley would have written about it, I'm sure. But there's much that happens elsewhere in the countryside that no one speaks of or writes off. And that's as much a pity is the weakness of the grumpy man's tiny hot brain.

Last week I mentioned that Oprah Winfrey might want to join club k if you don't know what I'm talking about. listen to the podcast of last week's show when it is available, and I'm not sure whether to be amused or nauseated to learn that the cleverest person in the known universe Stephen Fry is launching, club fry, quote, an arena of forum, a social network, so duality the Society for the sharing of knowledge and passions. Unquote. Nice to know it's all being organized by what he calls my team. Here at haemoglobin hemoglobin towers, I've decided that the only possible response is to set up club key not having a team of spellbound acolytes to do the jiggery pokery it might take some time to get it up and running. But what can you expect if you sign up? Well, club key members will meet online once a month dressed in the club uniform of food splattered cyber tunics. discussion will be limited to allness illogical topics for obvious reasons, and grunting, whimpering whinging and prating will be actively encouraged. Think of it not as a club fry style arena or forum blah, blah, blah. Nor is the modern equivalent of a literary salon or an 18th century coffee house, but as a pond, a brackish and stagnant pond upon the both of which you wallow, breathing through a straw poking up into the spiral air above, which is swarming with midges and gnats. Occasionally, members will be given the opportunity to sprawled in a virtual drainage deck battling away flies, and even vultures, about hissy fits and projectile vomiting will be allowed. All club meetings will be recorded and posted on you boot, a version of the video sharing website which concentrates on violent kicking and stamping while wearing big sturdy hiking boots of the pixelated variety. I have every confidence that this initiative is going to take off in a big way and that we will easily outnumber the members of club Uber brain sorry, club fry. In fact, I have such faith in the project. So to get things started, I'm going to splatter my cybertronic with genetically modified sponge pudding and going round up some injured swallows from the local injured birds hospice right this minute. And with that, that's the end of this week's show. I'm afraid there isn't actually an application form to join club key on the hooting odd website. But maybe one day there will be bye bye
