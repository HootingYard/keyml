This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. So we've had to put up with Wimbledon and euro 2012 and the Olympics and the Paralympics and the Ryder Cup and the Lord knows whatever so called sporting events over the past few months, when all along there are those of us who've been waiting for the big one. I speak of course of the vagabonds regatta. By tradition, this takes place annually at roughly the same time as the picnic for detectives, and it really is the most splendid of all vagabonds for gases. It's not just the it's not just me who says that the light, Eric Hobsbawm thought so too. In an interview some years ago, he's reported to have said I think 20 million deaths give or take the old million was a price worth paying to usher in the glorious utopia of Soviet communism. But I mustache now because I have my complimentary Hampstead intellectuals ticket for the vagabond Regatta, and I wouldn't miss it for the world. It really is the most splendid of all vagabond for a gathers. Of course, Hobsbawm was living in La La Land when he claimed to be in possession of a complimentary Hampstead intellectuals ticket. The organizers of the vagabond regatta do not and I repeat, do not hand out free tickets to elderly North London, lefty academics living in Brookline houses who've never met an actual working class person in their lives. Know, they have to get their tickets the way everybody else does, by scrabbling in a brand tab in an often violent free for all. Indeed, the acquisition of tickets can be every bit as exciting as the regatta itself. Up and down the land. Farmers are paid to throw open their bombs outside which queues form at dawn. Inside each barn is a brand tub filled with Brannon straw and slurry and muck and somewhere within the filth one or two tickets for the vagabond regatta. Some people pay just to watch the unseemly scramble, the punching and kicking and gouging and stabbings of the desperate aspirants spectators. I think I would have paid to see Eric Hobsbawm get a good kicking, had I known which bound to attend. So if he did have a ticket, it would not surprise me to learn that he hired a proxy prole to enter the melee on his behalf. We know that that was the ruse employed by that other elderly North London lefty academic living in a Brookline house who'd never met her actual working class person in his life. Ralph Miliband. Happily, he was barred from the vagabond Regatta, when the ticket is proxy obtained, was found to be counterfeit. If you were lucky enough to get a non counterfeit ticket, and still be in possession of all your limbs, you're certainly in for a treat. Down to the riverside you go past the field where the picnic for detectives is in full swing. The spectators area on the riverbank is muddy and slushy and the stink of unnameable effluence walks through the foul air. There are the rowing boats. They're empty of course at this stage just before dawn on the day of the regatta you tuck into your official regatta snack of compressed reconstituted meat and gristle slices on a bed of contaminated lettuce leaves in a basket. Headphones jammed into your ears. You listen to your I fry tuned into Stephen fries pre regatta commentary. In recent years there have been moved to replace fry with someone less ubiquitous. But as so many others have learned Resistance is futile. You slip your can of squelch Oh, you leave through the official program sponsored by Dignitas casting your eye over the beautifully executed mezzotints of the vagabonds reading up on their form. Ned grinds for example, no fixed address toothless brain blasted pronounced limp rags and tatters noxious palm vermin in Buffon never been anywhere near a boat as those shrill cries when confronted But stretches of water.

Then when night is almost done, and sunrise grow so near that we can touch the spaces. It's time to smooth the hair and get the dimples ready for Here come the vagabond. driven down to the river bank by the official regatta brutes. They're shoved one by one through the mud into the water, and let's make it as best they can to midstream and clamber each aboard the boat smeared with a decoction of his own particular stench. Then the hooter is sanded, and as if, by magic, the vagabonds grasp the oars and begin to roll. It is not magic, of course, but the result of long weeks of Pavlovian conditioning. And so they row chaotically bumping into each other, getting their oars in tangled in thickets of water weed, going round in circles, eerily akin to the closing scene of Aguirre the wrath of God, but without the monkeys. One or two of the vagabonds might somehow managed to make it as far as the lethal high voltage cables strung across the river upstream, and then the sparks fly. After several hours of this fun and frolic, the hooter sounds again, this is the signal for the snipers perched in trees to riddle the rubbing boats with bullet holes. Yes, it saves time. It's well worth shoving the earphones back into your lug holes. So listen to Stephen Fry again, as he keeps a tally of which vagabonds go down courageously with their boats, and which Splosh in ungainly fashion back to the riverbank mud. After that, there is a common all sing song, and the surviving vagabond, if any, a given a penny. By tradition, this is an old Penny, a one D, rather than a one p coin. And that's not legal tender, so utterly worthless. But you should see their shattered faces light up with glee. It's a site that encapsulates all that is glorious about the vagabond Regatta, more glorious even than Soviet communism.

In his fascinating new book, be the intellectual gadfly. Slobodan gadfly, posits a world in which the game of ping pong does not exist. He then proceeded to invent it through the power of imagination. It will be easy to dismiss the work as pointless, pseudo intellectual twaddle. And many critics have adopted precisely that line. Here, for example, is Ralph Guten Tag writing in the ping pong list. Seldom have I read such a blithering Farago of drivel. My cat could write a more sensible book than this. In fact, he has done meats in jelly, daytime naps and the torture of birds is available now from all good bookshops. But I digress. Even if we accept Mr. gadflies preposterous premise of a ping pong lawless universe, must we be subjected to page after page of this strenuous mental groping towards some sort of fully imagined tabletop based indoor sport played with bats and lightweight balls? As if that were not piffling enough, there is further piffle in store in the shape of an entire chapter devoted to a wholly imaginary scoring system, which turns out on close inspection to be identical to the actual scoring system used in actual games of ping pong in the actual world. Guten Tag however, is positively enthusiastic in comparison to Seebohm, not Susan Sontag, writing in the new ping pong list. Now, never ever in all my days, have I read such a blithering ferragosto drivel. As soon as I finished reading it, I burned it. Then I went out to the bookshop, where I bought it burned all the copies they had in stock. Then for good measure, I burned down the bookshop. As the flames lick the sky. I held in one hand the ping pong back, and then the other hand a ping pong ball. And when the fire brigade arrived with bells clanging, I challenged every man jack of them to a game of ping pong. Look, I was saying the game exists, why pretend it doesn't and then try to imagine it. The fire brigade could only nod in agreement, thus proving the utter futility of Slava Dan gadfly gadflies thesis. Well, I can't help but think that Mrs. Guten tag and the sun tog I'm missing the point of the book. Quite what that point is. I'm not sure myself. But I have neither the time nor the inclination to worry my little head about such niceties. And it is indeed a little head not much bigger than a ping pong ball, on account of certain mishaps in the maternity ward where I was born. I'm often asked if life has presented me with certain insurmountable difficulties due to my tiny whitened almost spherical head. And my invariable answer is, no, it is not fair. I carry myself with aplomb, and meet the astonished gazes of those I encounter with a steely gaze of my own. If they continue to gaze, or to prod me with their fingers, as if I were a circus freak. I take from my pocket, the ping pong bat, I always carry about my person, and I thump them smartly on the head with it several times. I do not think it necessary to understand the point of Mr. gadflies book to enjoy it. I would go further and say it's not necessary to understand the point of any book to enjoy it. What after all, is the point of Rolf Guten Tag cat book? Does it give us new insights into feline life? It does not. Does it more importantly, tell us of a cat's approach to the game of ping pong. It does not, indeed, save for one passage in which the cat narrator chases a ping pong ball around a confined space in a state of frenzy. There is no mention of ping pong at all. This absence or lacuna makes it a highly unusual book, at least in my experience, and that perhaps, is the point. And as much as I enjoyed the cat's book, so I enjoyed Slava, Dan gadflies. The opening chapter, in which he paints a vivid picture of a universe in which ping pong does not exist, and never has existed is a toward divorce toward the force.

It's a world very much like our own in almost every particular. It even has a few people in it like myself with ping pong balls size heads, though, of course, we're not described as such, for in this alternative universe. Without ping pong, they are of necessity no ping pong balls, gadfly has to invent them, just as he had to invent the back and the neck and the rules and the scoring system and invent them he does each in turn. He does not spare us the details of his mental agony. There are false starts wrong turnings, red herrings and mind bogglingly stupid decisions. In chapter four for example, gadfly recounts his struggle to imagine a ping pong ball. As yet, he has no concept of either the bat or the net, or the rules or the scoring system. He has not even arrived at the idea that the game might be an indoor one played on a tabletop. Indeed, he's not even thought of the game. At this stage, his only concern is the ball in his parallel universe, a wholly new type of ball, which he challenges himself to bring into existence. laughably the first ping pong ball he conceived is the size and shape and texture of a medicine ball. It is not absolutely identical to a medicine ball of course, for they already exist in his ping pong Lois world. While I was reading this chapter, with its tragic undertone, I couldn't help but become engulfed by my own imaginings. I wondered what my life would be like if instead of having a ping pong ball head, I had a medicine ball head. It was easy enough to posit a slightly different maternity ward and mishap that could have had such an outcome for my head. But I found it far more difficult to picture how different things would have been for me. Would I still go about with a ping pong bat in my pocket, ready to strike the impolite and if I did not, how would I deal with such people? Trying to fathom the answers to these questions may be all the more admiring of Slobodan gadflies great act of imagination in inventing from nothing, the game of ping pong. hooting yard writing 17 stars.

I don't know about you, but many years ago, I learned never to ignore the if a book has a little section of acknowledgments which I must admit, when I first began reading books and never a little acknowledgement thing, I ignored it, I thought it wouldn't be worth reading. And this this happened until sometime I think in the early 1990s. About 20 years ago, I read an extremely fat book called interestingly, the name of the book has gone completely out of my head, desperate, something abandoned lives Anyway, it was a huge compendium of stories of castaways and and other people caught in cataclysmic situations such as being, you know, abandoned on a mountainside or something. Great book. And I'm rather annoyed that I can't remember the title. But that said, One thing about this book was that at the end, it had a section of acknowledgments which I was going to ignore, until I noticed that it was about 15 pages long. And I then read it, and it was fantastic. It was really interesting read. Obviously, I hadn't heard of most of the people who were being Sankt, but the whole way it was written was was great. So now I always make sure I read the acknowledgments. And in the five week hiatus of the summer holiday, or the late summer holiday at resonance in my absence for a couple of weeks, and one of the books I read was an 1943 novel by Rainer heppenstall. Raina happens so who I've mentioned before, who was the first translator into English of Raymond Roussel wrote many novels himself and true crime books, interesting and fascinating character ended up living in deal. Anyway, I was reading his novel Saturn nine. And the book begins with acknowledgments and disclaimer. And as is my habit, I read it, and I'm very glad I did because it's possibly the most amusing acknowledgments and disclaimer I have ever read in a published novel, satin line by Raina heppenstall 1943, begins last. fragments of this narrative has appeared in Harper's Bazaar kingdom come the new English weekly and partisan review. It is fiction, outside pages 130 to 134. All the characters are imaginary, and no further reference is made to a living or recently deceased person.

Brilliant that wasn't I think, I read the book and all of those people do turn up, as does the person who is acknowledged to be on pages 131 and 34. Who's Oskar kokoschka. Anyway, and, yes, there are no acknowledgments and disclaimer for the following piece, the least none that I can think of. Right now. I didn't have a dog in the fight. I didn't have a dog full stop. And there wasn't a fight. Exactly. It was more of a skirmish. One gang of warriors armed with towards charged screaming at another gang of warriors, also armed with swords. There were one or two clangs of blade against blade. But then the second gang ran away back to their bivouac, and the first gang still screaming their heads off, took possession of the area of land on which the skirmish had taken place. It was not quite land being more accurately described as salt marsh, but the warriors were well pleased with themselves. Their blood curdling screens turned to chanting and they counted their victory song, which went something like this. We have vanquished our foes, our swords are caked with their blood. Truly, they have been ripped to shreds and the Salton marshland is ours. That's a translation. In the original we lines rhyme and have a pleasing rhythmic flow. You will note however, that it's not strictly accurate, the photos ran away before they could be ripped to shreds, and not a drop of blood was spilled. It remains true, however, that I didn't have a dog in the fight. It doesn't matter that I had no dog that there was no fight as such. The statement has its own inner coherence and logic. Would things have been any different if I did have a dog and there had been a fight? Let's imagine that instead of running away, the second gang of warriors splashing about in the southern Marsh, we're determined to keep possession of it. When the first gang came charging at them screaming, the second gang were not cowed and instead started hacking wildly their attackers who hacked back swords clashed stabbings occurred, limbs were locked. There was much bloodshed by the time they finished fighting. Most of the Warriors on either side were either dead or splayed upon the salt marsh groaning. Those who could still walk upright retreated. The salt and Marsh remained disputed territory, which gang of warriors took possession of it would depend upon further fighting, perhaps tomorrow after each side had had the chance to replenish their numbers. Meanwhile, what about me and my putative dog for the purposes of vividness let us bestow upon it a breed and a name. It is a jack Russell Terrier, and its name is Skippy. For even more vividness. Let us posit that Skippy is celebrated in song by a chorus of tinies they sing Skippy that terrier Oh, what a hound. What Kim's scamper across the ground, be it Southern Marsh or meadow. skippyjon jolly good fellow. That is not a translation as you can probably tell by the rhyme in the first couplet and the half rhyme in the second by the Do not fret that the tinies assembled to sing Skippy praises are in any danger from the screaming sword wielding warriors. We shall place the tinies off to one side, safe behind some kind of barricade. In fact, that's where Skippy my putative dog is. Sorry, I don't know why pause, then we shall place the screen we should place the tinies off to one side, safe behind some kind of barricade. In fact, that's where Skippy my putative dog is, and I am too flat explained why I don't have a dog Skippy in the fight. I wouldn't want him to come to any harm if he existed, that is

Frank Key  25:48
not out of any overwhelming love for dogs. For an actual fact, I detest and fear them. But because I'd like to think that if I did have a dog as a pet, I would do my best to protect it from bloodthirsty screaming warriors armed with swords. I wouldn't be much of a dog owner would I? If I picked Skippy up and chucked him over the barricade and commanded him to go and fetch a stick I threw into the crashing Malaya of warriors. Dogs can be very trusting. And the likelihood is that Skippy would gaze at me adoringly and scamper unquestioningly into the salt marsh, there to be torn to bit by the razor sharp blades of the fighting men. They might not stab Skippy purposely. But if he were caught up in the violence by going to retrieve the throne stick, he will almost certainly fall victim to what is known as collateral damage. So if I did have a dog in the fight, even peripherally or circumstantially, he would probably come to a bad end. I would have to locate the grieving tinies to whose hearts were filled to bursting with love and admiration for Skippy as attested by this song. Though his violent death was caused by the chaotic hacking of swords in a battle, which was nothing to do with him, nor with me, whose only action was to throw the stick frame to effect. The tinies might well blame me. They would see singing and turn on me with looks of reproach and accusation. I'm not sure how I'd go about placating them. I suppose I could produce another putative dog. Another jack Russell Terrier, also called Skippy and by sleight of hand and misdirection pretend it was the same dog and bloodied and in one piece and alive, but where would I get such a dog quickly enough to convince the tinies All in all, I'm thankful that I didn't have a dog in the fight. Without the dog, there would be no call for a chorus of Chinese to sing its praises from behind a barricade. Nor for me to throw a stick into the midst of a mad tangle of clashing screaming blood drenched warriors for the putative dog to fetch and with no dead dog. The Chinese would not turn on me with a rage and wildness more terrible than an army with banners. And that is the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I will be back with more stuff for you next week. Hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
