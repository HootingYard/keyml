Good afternoon as you've just learned from that station identities resonance 104 point four FM. This is hooting yard on the air and my name is Frank key and I'm going to read to you for half an hour. The reading may be punctuated by hideous choking fits because I seem to have a frog in my throat and I've got some water so don't worry, but just talk among yourselves if the program is interrupted by the sounds of hideous coughing and choking. And without further ado, then let's crack on. One of the difficulties that beset Joost van dongle BRAC, throughout his career as a so called suburban shaman, was the ruinous cost of insurance having been dragged through the courts by a pointy town quantity surveyor who claimed emotional distress, disfigurement and loss of earnings. After being entranced into a week long state of whirling ecstatic frenzy. Van dongle Brack vowed never again to practice his mystic arts without being covered. His first approach was to a greasy insurance agent with an unfortunate cow lick of hair, who dithered and fast and seemed more intent on his executive desktop bonsai garden, then on the urgency of the suburban shamans business. The next three people he consulted were by turns lost in wistfulness egg bound and unseemly, and one of them failed to provide van dongle Brack with a suitable chair in which to sit during their appointment. He was ushered into a seat that emitted a pneumatic hisses and tilted and swiveled on tubular steel pistons. It was van dongle BRAC thought the most unshaved manic chair in which he had ever tried to sit. He drugged each of the three to be unsuitable. And then one evening in a tavern, the suburban shaman struck up a conversation with a mountebank, who was passing through pointy town on his way to a seaside psychic small gas board. ferns and berries decked the brim of this mountebank hat is bizarre was half flesh half mascara at a certain angle, you could have mistaken him for the god bow. It was difficult to imagine that he had once been an actuary, but that was indeed the case. And he had maintained many friendships with past office colleagues in the insurance industry. listening attentively to van dongle brax plight as the two of them sank pint after pint of diluted rosemary and hibiscus syrup on the tavern balcony, looking out over the filth strewn fields which stretched unbroken to the horizon. The mountebank eventually took a card out of his pocket and handed it to the shaman. This is the man you need. He said. His premiums are ridiculously expensive. You may be alarmed by his taste in class on a enamelware and never ever tried to make him laugh. But those things aside, he is finally as an insurance man as you will find on the terrestrial globe. Van Dongo Brack was puzzled by this reference to a globe vary in his belief system. The Earth was cylindrical, tapered at one end and ineffably mysterious at the other. But he liked and trusted the mountebank, whose pencil like perspicuity appealed to him, as did the hat brim decked with ferns and berries, and look which the suburban shaman was to ape in the coming years. Six weeks later, after a particularly exhausting session of communal hysteria around a bonfire in one of those filthy fields, Joost van dongle Brack took the bus to o hooligans Wharf. He had the insurance man's card in his pocket and berries on the brim of his hat. The firm's he decided would have to wait. At the time of which I ride the pier at that Brian soaked hellhole had not yet collapsed, and it was in a booth at the far end, a mile or more out to see that the suburban shaman came face to face with john Claude una nugu. It's a name you might know, especially if you're an aficionado of the kind of insurance man who spends his leisure time as a creative genius, Charles Ives, Wallace Stevens and Franz Kafka spring to mind and una new glue can be added to their company. acerbic, battered. The DRAM beauty soaked eerie, foolish grunting and hot to trot, john Claude Enugu with the self styled Grandmaster of the goofy and the

mccobb. In his numerous pulp paperbacks, he explored with forensic precision, the narrow territory where that which is goofy meets that which is mccobb. Sometimes in his work goofiness wins out, and other times he favors the mccobb at his best, the two modes or registers, or styles, or styles or modes, or registers, or styles are inextricable melded and fused and joined and inextricably fused and melded in a joint of characteristically una new goo esque inextricable, it can be hard to see whether goofiness falls off and the macabre begins just as it can be hard to see where the macabre ends and the goofiness takes over. So inextricably fused are they in una new goo esque melden mint Now you might be touching irritably that I'm repeating myself, or at least writing in a peculiarly annoying and inelegant manner. In fact, that was a clever pastiche of una new goos early style seemed to best effect in early trash like the macabre thing from goofy town, or the goofy people from the macabre village. Later in his career, he devised new tricks and quirks. And I'm not alone in thinking that no other writer has ever made such fantastic use of metallics, block capitals, and exclamation marks. One of the great pleasures of a middle period Enugu novel such as the macabre yet goofy duck pond, is the manner in which each sentence is given equal weight, every single one ending in an exclamation mark. It is the only book I know which when read aloud, demands to be shouted out at the top of one's voice. Much like Stevens and Ives, but possibly not Kapha john Claude una nugu kept his working and creative lives separate. When devoting his time to insurance he set up in his booth on the pier. It was a small cramped booth of wood and canvas with a tin roof which resounded under the rain. And as you know, it often rained in a hooligans Wharf, for that was how the gods had ordered things. It was teaming down on the day that goosed van dongle Brack disembarked from the bus and made his way through the ill starred streets to the pier. There were numberless booths and kiosks on the pier in those days, and the suburban shaman found himself distracted by all sorts of depraved enticements as he shuffled along, stepping carefully on the rotting planks. He passed by Edna the squid woman, little Severin, the mystic badger, the astonishing food splattered Jesuit, Kim fat goo the evil tattooist David Ike David Blunkett bonkers Maisie and her scrunched up dish cloths. And the poopsie Clutterbuck sextet, who performed the latest news headlines in the form of madrigals. a gust came in from the west and blue van dongle blackberries off the brim of his hat into the churning sea. Far out halfway to the horizon, he could see the telltale silhouette of a tugboat. What he wondered, was it going to tug out there? closer to shore, he saw dozens upon dozens of boys, red and yellow and blue boys, each with its own chain. Van dongle Brack had always loved the sound of change clanking at sea, and he stopped a moment on his prance along the pier to listen. But the faint clanking he heard was soon drowned out by the barking of a bedraggled twinkly twirly man in the doorway of a nearby booth, who was manipulating a source been on a bus ticket in remarkable ways. Such antics thought the shaman had what Roland Bart would called should we songs like almost everybody else who uses the word, possibly including Bart's himself. He had no idea what it meant, but he was a shaman, a babbler of incantations, so why should he care? He tossed a coin at the feet of the twinkly twirly man told him that he admired his jewelry songs and headed on inside his booth, as fat raindrops pingdom Pang on the tin roof the Grand Master of the goofy and mcob was blotting the ink on a freshly written insurance policy that was not a goofy nor mccobb.

It was, if anything, a piece of actuarial magic that the suburban shaman would have admired for its hallucinatory qualities. In john Claude Udo new goos suspiciously manicured hands insurance policies became things of beauty if Vaughn dongle brax beliefs if van dongle brax beliefs were true, there is no doubt that una new goos policies would have to be filed at the end of the earth that terminated in ineffable mystery. bluffing done, the insurance agent cracked open another bottle of DRAM beauty, his own credo allowed for a globular Earth rather than a cylindrical one. Though privately, he held that this globe was like his stories, both goofy and mccobb. In that sense, he felt himself to be a realist and attitude which had caused him no end of grief with the Oh hooligans Wharf pier booth rental authority, which preferred to rent its booths and kiosks to the non reality based community. And they are have six or seven prancing paces away from the booth now, Van dongle back to saw himself as a realist all over him. The real existed on an ethereal plane accessible only through whirling about around a bonfire while counting gibberish. But as he always like to insist, it was very choreographed, whirling and absolutely specific gibberish. That was why a hapless goon like the like the litigious pointy town quantity surveyor could not just whirl and babble without the guidance of a shaman. And that was why the shaman needed insurance cover. And that was why Joost van dongle BRAC poked his head in through the entrance flap of the wood and canvas and Tim booth on the pier and saw dot dot dot. One Why did I resort to an ellipsis I did so partly in homage to late period in the new GUI, where the texts of such novels as beyond the macabre yet goofy duck pond actually have more ellipses than words. And partly because I wanted to go and make a cup of tea before bringing this narrative to a close. JOHN Claude una new goos work both in fiction and insurance was fueled by DRAM beauty, but mine is dependent upon copious cups of tea. I make no apologies for that. It was Thomas Quincy who said tea though ridicule by those who are naturally coarse in their nervous sensibilities will always be the favorite beverage of the intellectuals. Whether or not I'm an intellectual, is bad, futile conjecture, but I suspect I have more chance of being won through regular tea intake than by bandying about the recent word. Now that's quite enough twaddle. Let's return to that ellipsis Joost van dongle Brack poked his head into the booth and saw john Claude una new goon, the Grandmaster of the goofy and the mccobb, sitting at her little foldout camp table, swinging grand gooey and ready to sell him some hot to trot insurance. And Joost van dongle Brack poked his head into the booth and saw his doppelganger. for a split second, he thought he was looking into a mirror. The resemblance between the two was uncanny. Indeed it was mccobb was it also goofy? Why stop my chives? Yes, it was. And what happened next was goofy is still and even more macabre. For van dongle Brack went into the booth and close the flap behind him. There were witnesses to this, including the bedraggled twinkly twirly man, and David Ike, or possibly David Blunkett, and though they were not realists, their accounts painstakingly taken down by detective Captain kargh pan's Dowty squad of gumshoes were deemed reliable by the Oh hooligans, Wharf, Constabulary's, investigative, Uber brains. So we must accept that there were two men inside that booth on that sopping wet Thursday afternoon. Yet only one ever emerged. Was it john Claude Enugu? Or was it juiced? fandangle Brack, it was neither. Or it was both. It was we are forced to concede an entirely new being an entirely new kind of being. I know this may sound implausible to members of the reality based community but let me ask you this. Is there any other way to explain that? Within days, the Oh hooligans Wharf Chamber

of Commerce registered a new company, which offered shamanic Insurance Solutions to whom fees could be paid in the blood of ducks and the bones of Ospreys, and in pointed sticks set a fire.

Well, I seem to have got through that entire story without the threatened, choking fit. So good. If you spend a bit of time thinking about the matter, it becomes apparent that human ingenuity has created a myriad of pastes. At one end of the spectrum, a thick paste tacky to the touch, and at the other eye paste so runny that they're akin to go. There are other ways of thinking about the variety of pastes other than the thick to thin or tacky to goo spectrum, but they have less appeal. Why is this? Not surprisingly, it's a question to which Dobson once turned his magnificent pamphlet writing brain. It has to be said that the resulting 14 page essay is one of his less engaging works, fancying that he might win some kudos with the scientific community. Dobson splattered his text with technical terminology of which we had no grasp of whatsoever. It's been reported that up and down the land laboratory cafeterias rang with laughter as boffins digested a stettner draft of the pamphlet, which Dobson had circulated ahead of publication in the event, tacky to glue some frightfully complicated thoughts on the consistency of manufactured pastes was only ever issued in this scrappy format cranked out in the potting shed by marigold true as an act of kindness to the increasingly beleaguered Dobson. a pauper with a Barrow was employed to trundle copies of the pamphlet around various market squares, but he lacked the mouthy bunker business required of a true salesman and returned with the entire print run intact, downcast and hopeless. The pauper trudged along the winding lane towards shade Dobson and crew, heaving the pamphlets and a filthy frayed sack. His Barrow had been stolen by cut purses, unless determined pamphleteer may have thrown in the towel at this point, but as has often been remarked, there was an age of stealing Dobson. After taking a turn around the pond and pelting pebbles at swans, he crashed back into the house and immediately fired off a letter to Rex tint, the noted mezzotint test. Ordinarily, of course, so celebrated a mezzotint test would have had nothing to do with a pamphleteer on his uppers. But there was between the two men a special bond. It was a bond forged in childhood, in an orchard in the teeth of a summer thunderstorm, a bond redolent of the hit single two little boys by the bearded antipathy and Renaissance man, Rolf Harris. Neither a wooden horse nor later trench warfare, were involved in the Dobson tint pact. But you get the general idea. Dobson's inspiration on this gusty Tuesday was to bind his scientific pamphlet a new with a really terrific Rex tent mezzotint on the cover. Sales he felt sure would go through the roof, even when handled by the Pauper shoving the hastily scribbled letter into a pre stamped Jiffy bag and enclosing as a memento of the pact a couple of hazelnuts. Dobson roared back out and headed for the postbox at the top of Pang Hill. There is a long running quiz show on the BBC called A Question of Sport. One of the regular features is around called what happened next, in which the footage of some unusual sporting event is stopped just before the crucial moment. Let's imagine that phantoms, cinematographer, taking grainy black and white film of the swans of Pang Hill pond, turn their camera that day on the excited pamphleteer and followed him up the hill. Now, freeze the imaginary film with Dobson just a few paces from his goal. Why did that Griffey bag never plop into the postbox. Something happened to stop the pamphleteer in his tracks, something that meant the letter and the hazelnuts whenever sent. That tacky to goo was never rebound with a terrific rx 10 mezzotint cover that not a single copy of the original gastec nerd pamphlet was ever sold, and that Dobson in despair, never again tried to worm his way into the core of the big forbidding world of science.

Next up, apparently the grumpy man that figure of cars and nightmares as a song. It begins. I granted the sun. I granted the moon. My grunts do not follow a tune. I granted the stars. I grant at the sky. My grunting makes household pets die. One day in March 1967, the grantee man went into a recording studio. He was accompanied by a handpicked gaggle of musicians who later became some of the biggest names in prog rock, including future members of Yes, Emerson lake and Palmer and spooky tooth. Also present was the youthful Gordon Sumner now known to the world as Sting, who was drafted in for his ability to wine in a high pitched cattle wall. I say they were hand picked, but in fact the grantee man arranged for each muzodo to be plucked from their mundane doldrums by the claw of gak. It was an experience none of them ever forgot. It's true in the use of a producer or sound engineer, the grantee man bharden, bolted the studio doors and world about in a grunting frenzy until all the musicians were suitably cowed. It would be unkind to state which of the Emerson lake and Palmer trio was so frightened that he hid in a cupboard and piddled in his lwn pants, until coaxed out with the promise of Garibaldi biscuits. 10,000 years old and covered in sores, the grunty man had recently started to use a guide dog. This dog Alan was some kind of Beagle and was hopelessly inadequate for its task. It was blind itself in one I suffered from muscle spasms and liver failure, and harbored a doggy desire to take part in the space program, rather than to have to drag around with the grumpy man. It's spent most of the recording session curled up inside Carl Palmer's bass drum, dreaming of the stars. The grantee man decided to call his one off band regimens rudiments after the Latin primer used by generations of schoolchildren. With such a name he thought he would not be dismissed merely as a grotesque grunting ogre from the earth primeval past, but as a somewhat more sophisticated hepcat kind of being. Having a hit record would give him even more charisma, and his long cherished desire to win social acceptance would be fulfilled. Perhaps he wanted too much. Certainly, the auspices were not good as the band huddled in a corner of the studio quaking with terror. Allen, the guide dog snoozed, and no one bothered to locate the light switches, when little Gordon Sumner whimpered that they would need at least sunlight to work by. The grantee man unleashed great bellows of his sulfurous phosphorescent breath. The studio was lit by a dim green mist, which hung in the air, and the band stumbled reluctantly to their positions by ran through the music a few times, but never to the grantee man's satisfaction less Herman's Hermits more Scriabin he shouted, and as they could not understand his grunts he clawed the words onto the walls with his talents. But none of the band not even the bombastically inclined future Emerson lake and Palmer were familiar with the works of the diminutive and neurasthenic Russian composer, and they stuck to a toothsome sort of pop pap. The grantee man kept bellowing to maintain the phosphorescent light levels. Alan, the guide dog woke up briefly and savaged Carl Palmer's petals stained loon pants and then a janitor arrived. Old Ted Carr pans intention was to throw the intruders out of the studio. In the event he saved the situation. completely calm in the face of the hideous grumpy man and contemptuous of the young musicians, particularly staying here at once sized up the scene set the tapes running and put the whole lot of them through their paces. Even the grunty man defer to the janitor retreating to a spot up in the rafters and allowing the little some the boy to take on the lead vocal while Alan the guide dog refreshed after his nap how backing vocals or backing house the instrumentalists to seemed energized by the crusty old janitors presence. Greg lake in particular, demonstrating the sort of skills that would in a few years time like brain salad surgery such a millstone Sorry, I'm in milestone.

The track finished. Old Ted Carr pan sent the musicians packing and brought the grunting man down from his perch near the ceiling to record the beside a duet with alum the guide dog, the grantee man granted Allen the guide dogs slobbered and the janitor moulded their den into a majestic three minute miniature rock opera, subsequently plagiarized by everybody from Ultravox to swamp eating master of the Queen's music, Peter Maxwell Davis. So, whatever happened to the recordings, some say that the adult Gordon Sumner, wealthy beyond the dreams of Avarice, but still as a middle aged man, calling himself sting opposed any reissue of the disc and even had the master tapes destroyed. Another Rumor has it that Alan the guide dog somehow managed in 1977 to get himself blasted towards satin on a space rocket and took the tapes with him. The grantee man himself remains silent on the subject, merely grunting horribly in his cave, or next to his pond, haunting the nightmares of tiny children, tuneless once more and resigned to his immortal fate.

I'm going to close briefly with this, which means we may go a bit over time, but I've been told that it's okay. I read somewhere last week that Mohammed is now the second most popular name for newborn boys in the United Kingdom. It strikes me as a bit odd that you can get beheaded for drawing a picture of the Prophet Mohammed, but it's perfectly fine to attach his name to your son. Still, there's much about Islam that I find perplexing, such as a recent fact why in Egypt, which allows an unmarried woman to work in an office alongside men, so long as she breastfeeds each of them five times to create a familial bond is a sensible idea. Anyway, I was prompted to think about boys names and more particularly what name I would ideally like to see and the number one spot above Mohammed, readers will know that I'm very keen on and listeners listeners will know that I'm very keen on seabag. But my current choice to become the most popular boy's name is su atonia. So not only is it a splendid resounding name, but of course it's also it also commemorates the author of the lives of the 12 seasons, su atonium, whose full name was Gaius Suetonius tranquilla. This can be seen as a kind of Dobson like figure in that many of his works are terminally out of print, that is their last possibly forever. We know that he wrote, among other things, physical defects of mankind, lives of famous halls, and an essay on critical signs used in books, but no trace of these works survives. Luckily we do have the rattling good read that is the lives of the 12 Caesars George Costanza in Seinfeld favor the names soda and seven, neither of which holds a candle to sewer toniest in my opinion. So if there are any expectant parents listening to this, and your newborn is a boy do the decent thing and named him after the Roman herb Dobson. And mother's Please note, while I would recommend breastfeeding, it would probably be a good idea to limit the milk supply to a little sooner toniest rather than sharing it out among those unprepossessing gets in the accounts department. And that's all from hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it and found it inspiring and educational. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
