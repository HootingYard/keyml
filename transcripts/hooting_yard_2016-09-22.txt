surrounded by microphones. I feel like an American presidential candidate. But which one? Yes, this is hooting out on the air. I'm global, local and timeless and some years ago, out of Spaceman described hooting yd vath a world of heroic infants rubbing shoulders with tugboat captains, extravagantly boof, haunted composers drinking and fighting in seedy dockside taverns, Jesuit priests lurking in kiosks on abandoned seaside piers, back God's haunting abandoned potato research stations huge grunting ogres drinking from systems in horrible caves and where diktats are being issued to Community Learning hubs by suburban shamans. Or shaman, I suppose, reading this rereading this recently I thought to myself, how right he is. But then I thought, hmm, we have not seen many tugboat captains hear about the light. My thoughts are not always followed by exclamation marks. But those two were casting around in my mind for a tugboat Captain I could tell you about I recalled the skipper of the tugboat beloved ski. This fellow was numerous scenic and highly strung character traits, which are quite undesirable in a tugboat captain, and led to several unfortunate episodes. Big majestic ships. Being tugged by the blowback ski suffered a series of minor and major calamities from dense below the plimsoll line to scuppering upon sand banks to attacked by enormous flocks of deranged guillemots. These incidents were not always the result of the tugboat, Skipper's mental weakness. But whether he was responsible or no, when the big ships captains gathered in conclave, they laid the blame firmly at his door. He is numerous scenic and highly strung, they said he cannot be allowed to tag our ships with no big majestic ships to talk, but I've actually lost its purpose. And so to do this Skipper, he took two traipsing the deck of the tugboat whaling and QiMing driving the rest of the crew crackers. Eventually, his second in command, the science officer, took him aside, bundled him into a cabin and gave him a talking to like several seconds in command. He was half Vulcan, with pointy ears, and he spoke with compelling logic. The blocky is a tugboat captain, he said, and therefore it must talk something. If we cannot talk big majestic ships, we will have to find something else to talk. But what dammit what yelled the skipper, who was clearly close to the end of his already frayed tether. Well, Captain replied his point he is science officer. It so happens I have been reading some back numbers of the daily pony predations digest. It seems there is a loose in the land, but happily close to the coast, an enormous squid named nevel muscle. It is already responsible for slobbering Li devouring one twee little pony and logically, one must assume it will go on to consume others and it's awful, hideous love crafty and manner. We can stop it Captain I suggest we send a landing party, capture the squid, drag it into shore, then attach it to our tugboat with chains and target far out to sea so it can no longer prey upon ponies. That's a fantastic idea, cried the skipper, and once his mood lifted, and he ceased scheming. Without further ado, he sent a landing party which captured the squid, dragged it to shore, attached it to the tugboat with chains and target far out to sea. This is terrific said the skipper with tagging something just as a tugboat must, if it is the fit, if it is fit to be called a tugboat. But his joy was short lived, for unbeknown to the skipper far out at sea. The enormous squids

distressed mother was searching for her son, Mrs. Chlorine Winslow mossop was so drugged canting a giant squid that she made nevel look like a mere minnow. And when she found him, she reared up from beneath the waves, towering over the tugboat has tentacles thrashing violently, and from suckers on those tentacles, she emitted an eldritch viscous goo that burned through the ion chains, tagging her son as if they were wisps of straw, and she freed him. And then with a horrible gurgling noise, so loud it made the sun shake in the heavens. She slobbering really devoured the tugboat plawecki and its crew in a single awful gulp. It happened the very last second, just as he was about to be swallowed up. The Skipper managed somehow to kick himself clear. He swam away as the gigantic squid and almost as gigantic sun disappeared into the sonic depths of the broiling sea. He swam and swam until he reached a remote at all. exhausted, he clung to the rock, and slowly agonizingly pull himself up out of the sloshing sea. He was marooned, but no longer imperiled. In spite of his highly strung neurasthenia, the skipper was a resourceful fellow, and he kept himself alive by drinking rainwater, and eating barnacles and the occasional given mot which plummeted and accountably from the sky. And it kept his mind busy by studying from memory Catholic theology, to the point where one day, several years after his Maroon mint, he felt able to hold Excuse me. And he kept his mind busy by studying from memory Catholic theology, to the point where one day several years after his Maroon mint, he felt able to ordain himself as a Jesuit priest. And that children is the story of how the legendary at old Jesuit, came to hold sway over a remote stretch of the vast and merciless sea. Amen.

For a long time, I thought that my my stellar film career had began and ended with Sharon Smith, fantastic film of a recipe for gruul. If you haven't seen it, it's on available to watch online. Probably if he put a recipe for gruul film into Google, you'll find it or you can find a link to it. Hunting yard. So very good film. But I thought that was 2014 I think will possibly 15. And for a long time, I thought it was my only only intervention in the film world. But then, the other day online, I discovered another film which was made in 2005 As in sixth, and it's called Creekside artists is made by endwell Productions. And like a recipe for girl, Creekside artists is a is a short and it's basically someone going around with a handheld camera in an art studio that used to belong to the Creekside artists 10 years ago. Excuse me. So yeah, it's basically I've kind of seen a various a, or whatever you call it, possibly a documentary, but it's a it's a little film about an arts done arts, art studio space. And the thing is that the soundtrack that on what they're doing is they're listening to resonance. In the studio, they've got resonance on the radio. And so you've got and the filming it during hooting out on the air. So what you're hearing in the direct soundtrack is me babbling. And the piece I'm reading in this in this film, very old piece, obviously, because we're talking about 1010 years ago, is called a piece called fear of squirrels. And I'm gonna read it to you again. Dobson was afraid of squirrels. Here's why. It was a damp and ruinous Thursday, and he had not had any breakfast. He slapped his hand on the table and shouted, I must have my mermaid I must have some mama made. There was nobody to hear his complaint, except for an ant, which was making its way across the floor of his hovel, and the end didn't care being an insect. Dobson had not even noticed the end. In any case. he leapt out of his chair, put on his big reindeer hide anorak brought back from one of his Arctic expeditions and trudged outside, muttering now instead of shouting. Have I ever told you that there were several important trees on the path outside Dobson's door, there was a sycamore and a U, a large and a pine. Dobson was fond of trees, usually, although he was unable to tell the difference between them. Gone were the days when he would festoon his hair with fallen leaves and twigs, inviting ridicule from the local whippersnappers Dobson in the days of which I write had adopted a sober mean indeed a gloomy one. Dobson Dobson don't look so dismayed as acquaintances would say, to rich the out of print pamphlet, his response was to look heavenward as if in great pain, adopting the era of an early Christian martyr, one lined up for some particularly bloodthirsty persecution. Dobson often skim through the pages of foxes Book of Martyrs to pick up tips, but I digress. On this damp marmalade less morning, Dobson walks past the sycamore, Sycamore, the U, the large and the pine, onward past a repulsive dick, past the post office and the pig hearts and the Viper's nest and the glue factory up the lane towards the big unexplained building on the hill, the wind how it always did.

Back in the hovel, the ant had vanished into a crevasse in the wainscot justice Dobson arrived at the gates of the building. These gates were enormous and forbidding, and strange and Rusty and locked and bolted and unnecessary. For there was a wooden door set in the base and British wall which skirted the building, and it was only a few feet away to the left of the gates, or to the right, I cannot remember precisely, I've never been there myself. I'm only reporting this as it was told to me by marigold to on the day after Dobson's death, after she had had a bath, and was sipping tea from an inelegant 10 mug in the shabby parlor of a horrible hotel hard by the banks of the river record into Bob Ned web share. Dobson knew all about the wooden door, so why did he carry by the strange rusty gate? Was he confused? Was his mind a jumble due to lack of marmalade? Or did he have a tryst? We do not know. We do know that Dobson stood at those gates. On that damp Thursday, peering intently through them for a full quarter of an hour before turning around and heading off to old jack blockheads foodstuffs tent, where he bought a jar of marmalade and some pastry and a pot of some kind of edible paste, rich, old jack blockhead had left unlabelled The year was 1952. Dobson and the vendor of foodstuffs had their usual argument about the pamphleteers promissory note, or words to the promissory note, a page torn from his notebook on which he had scrolled words to the effect that sooner or later he would do right by our jack blockhead. And if he did not, then make the heavens smite him, and make all his days be leavened with Whoa, it was advantageous for Dobson that old jack blockhead was a man of great charity and purely intellect. And after a few minutes, he left a 10th through its great granny flats with his jar and pot and a paper bag for the pastry. They would not fit in the single pocket of his anorak. Savi carried them in his ungloved and mittened hand what pangs of a Dobson back to the strange, enormous rusty gates of the big unexplained building on the hill, there was a fallen log, a log fallen from a trembling Poplar, slap bang next to the gates and Dobson sat on it and ate the pastry, and he stayed sitting there despite the fact that it began to rain heavily. He didn't even bother to pull up the hood of his anorak, although that may be because it was rife with holes made by starving moths, and his head would have got wet anyway. Wet but surely not as wet as it did get as he sat on the popular log in the downpour, eating pastry with his pot of paste and marmalade jar beside him outside the forbidding and strange and Rusty and locked and bolted and unnecessary gates of the big unexplained building on the hill on that Thursday morning in 1952. When he first became terrified of squirrels. Why? I asked marigold to a she sipped her tea in the shabby hotel parlor. Why did Dobson become so fearful of squirrels on that particular day? She glanced at me briefly, and I was disconcerted by the weird look in her eyes. Those bushy tails she began, then fell silent, turning to stare out of the window. I followed her gaze and saw the Grave Digger walking across the lawn, toting his spade jauntily over his shoulder. Those bushy, bushy tail with marigold Chu repeated. She drank the rest of her tea, put the mug down on the floor by her feet and stood up. I must go and have a few words with the Grave Digger, she said. And she swept out of the room, as breezily as a bereaved woman on crutches can sweep breezily from a hotel parlor on the day after the death of one true friend on this magnificent and baffling planet.

After I posted or reposted that story on the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org I got a letter from Tim thurn. Dear Mr. Key, he wrote, I was intrigued when reading your piece of fear of squirrels to come across the phrase marmalade lists morning. I've not encountered this particular conjunction of words before. Could you tell me what it means? You're sincerely, Tim Fern. I'm only too happy to oblige Tim. We may define a mama later this morning as a morning without marmalade. For many people marmalade is an essential and intrinsic part of their morning, when for example, where breakfast menu includes toast, and after the toast is buttered, it is then spread with marmalade. greedier people, and those without table manners may just spoon marmalade straight from the jar into their mouth. We may taught at this practice that cannot deny that it happens regretable as it may be. The point is that whether consumed spread on toast in a refined manner or straight from the jar. In a disgusting manner, marmalade is present at the breakfast table, and the morning is patently not marmalade lists. We speak of marmalade to this morning's when the jar of marmalade is not present. This can occur for several reasons, the job might be languishing on loved on a shelf in the pantry, or the jar might be brought to the breakfast table only for it to be discovered that it is empty or as near as dammit. In some circumstances, the pantry and related ladders and cupboards might be entirely innocent of marmalade. This happens in what is known as a marmalade plus home. If I may speak for a moment of my own experience, I can say with some certainty that I have lived through thousands of marmalade less mornings. This is because toast and marmalade is not one of my regular breakfasting items. As far as I know. It's not compulsory to include toast and marmalade in mother's breakfast. And that's I choose not to. Of course, we can imagine a state or regime which makes it compulsory. In this nightmarish situation, a mama later this morning would be a criminal offense. There would be patrols of marmalade enforcement goons going door to door barging into homes demanding evidence of marmalade woba tide, the mama legless outlaw. Fortunately, this remains a dystopian fantasy. We are free to include or to exclude marmalade from our breakfast. We're even free to issue the toast and scuff the marmalade straight from the jar. We need not even make use of a spoon. We might simply dig the mama bite out of the jar with our bare hands, stuffing our mama lady fingers into our mouths and licking and sucking until every last atom of marmalade is shoveled down on Goliath. Such a practice is visually arresting if barbaric and one feels that a marmalade was morning would be a small but necessary mercy were we to witness it. The 20th century's greatest pamphleteer Dobson wrote a fascinating essay entitled marmalade does it come in a jar or a pot out of print? maddeningly he fails to give a conclusive answer his own question. Instead, he veers off over several hundred pages into a frankly incoherent diatribe, taking potshots or possibly jar shot at a variety of seemingly unrelated topics, including aniseed, bleach, corrugated cardboard, dentists, egg timers, flip top lids, gas, hags, Inc, jam kaylynn, loopy persons, Madagascar, nettles, oxygen tense, past mentari quips, rhubarb sandwiches, Count olid vipers, weasels, xylophone is yobbos and zookeepers. We might concede that both jam and sandwiches are somewhat relevant to the ostensible topic. That is in case you've forgotten marmalade, but not in the way Dobson approaches them. Believe you me, I've read the pamphlet from cover to cover

You can count on the fingers of one deformed hand, the number of ornithologists to have paid serious attention to the clay pigeon. This is rather surprising as it's a highly unusual bird. Unlike most birds, the clay pigeon has neither feathers nor talons nor a beak. It is flightless and inanimate. Uniquely in the avian kingdom is disc shaped and made of clay In view of this neglect, the reissue of a classic text is most welcome. All you praise them to the circular ceramic bird press for its recent publication of the clay pigeon, its migration patterns, nesting habits, and terrible attrition rate caused by shooting written by the wild man of Ornithology, Walter mad, originally issued in 1926, on the eve of the general strike. This new edition is a facsimile down to the last detail, including those end papers, which caused such a fast, and were eventually to lead by all sorts of weird and eerie twists and turns. So the Hindenburg disaster on the sixth of may 1937. Let it be clear once and for all what once a man played no part in that dreadful event, and was nowhere near Naval Air Station lakehurst in New Jersey at the time, yes, yes, his brother Wilfred was there and they were identical twins. And there is certain photographic evidence, and one or two sworn affidavits and the compelling testimony of testimony of Flossie, Pelle Brown, the noted spirit medium who perished aboard the flaming Gulf airship, and later send telepathic messages from the beyond. But even when you add all these things up and take into account eyewitness statements on the so called peevish bus conductors, bombshell, there remains scarcely a shred of evidence to connect Walter mad with the disaster. Better that we remember him for his excellent book on the clay pigeon, even if much of it is ludicrous twaddle that no proper ornithologist has ever taken seriously. But what a proper ornithologist a most of them can't tell a night jar from a stone chat, especially in cases where both the night jar and the stone chat have been modeled in played by Tip Top bird ceramicists. God give me strength. That's all I've got time to read to you this week. If I start something else, time will run out. So I'm going to babble for a minute or two before we have some station idents and all that sort of thing before the next show. I mentioned hooting yard.org the hunting yard website do go there. There's there's thousands possibly millions of words to read. The site has now been going since 2003. So that's almost long enough to Jesuit education's takes seven years to graduate say, give me a child for the seven first seven years and the child is mined for life. So the the in the time, hooting yard has been an online presence to entire children could have been turned into Jesuits. Yeah, and there's some books available. There's a whole load of books available from hooting God, anthologies, and so on. And you can see see all the covers of all of those books on the on the website. And that's about it. So I hope you have a nice week and I'll be back next week when I'll tell you all about the class
