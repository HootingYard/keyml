Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. This week's show is sponsored by Eric and Brian, or I'm not sure maybe I'm meant to be sponsoring them. I must clear that up. Anyway, we've got a lot to get through in the next half hour, so let's crack on. Dobson was no stranger to controversy. But rarely did He create so tumultuous a brouhaha, as was caused by his pamphlet, hints and tips for intrepid explorers in the polar wastes out of print. Dobson himself had of course, never been anywhere near either the Arctic or the Antarctic. And one of the many puzzles he left behind for the unwary biographer, is the question of why he ever thought he was qualified to address the subject. He was only too ready to admit to his ignorance of certain matters, made plain in pamphlets such as my blistering ignorance of vast swathes of Ornithology. And when it comes to the brains of lobsters, I have no idea what I'm talking about, both of which are tragically out of print. Yet, he felt able to compile a list of hints and tips for polar exploration, and ensure that marigold true ran off more copies on the stettner machine in the potting shed, then she did have almost any other pamphlet he ever wrote. Indeed, a number of their breakfasts were ruined during a period in the 1950s. When the pamphleteer insisted that his in cammarata gobble down her kedgeree in double quick time, so she could hurry off to the shed to crank out another dozen copies. Ugly though he does seem to have actually had some success in selling them, though, this might have been drew to the breathtakingly gorgeous mezzotint of a polar bear. By the noted mezzotint test Rex tent, which was used on the cover. There was a sort of polar bear fad at the time, occasioned by the popular radio serial, the adventures of Martin the polar bear, starring Cicely Courtney and john Jacques Halbert. The historian and cultural commentator, Bevis seabag, has suggested compellingly that most of the people who bought Dobson's pamphlet, tore off the cover, place the mezzotint in a frame and hung it on the wall of their parlor and Chuck a pamphlet itself into the bin on read. But some people obviously did read it. Otherwise there would not have been a tumultuous brouhaha. And to mouth who was brouhaha there was with the knobs on several very foolish explorers went off to the Arctic or the Antarctic, clutching copies of Dobson's pamphlet, to the exclusion of any other written guidance whatsoever. It is fair to say that their lives were in his hands because his hints and tips were almost entirely spurious, idiotic, irrelevant, wrongheaded, fantastical and outright dangerous. Not one of these several fools ever returned alive from the polar waste. Hence, the tumultuous brouhaha when they're grieving relics and orphans, blames the pamphleteer and tried to have him prosecuted in a court of law. There were a few weeks during which Dobson had to face noisy marches and demonstrations, a temporary encampment of earnest young persons in tents outside his house, and some unkind newspaper headlines, including out of print pamphleteer sent explorers to certain death. bereaved taught, shamed pamphleteer with heart rending message scribbled with crayons on placard, and Antarctic widows. Ice Cube protest scuppered by unexpectedly balmy weather spell. A note for younger listeners. newspapers in those days were printed on much bigger sheets of paper and had more words and pictures.

But eventually, all were fast died down as it usually does. The marches and demonstrations were broken up by charging police horses. the futility of their tentage gradually dawned on the young persons, and the newspapers moved on to other stories, such as Vice President Nixon attacked by angry mob in Venezuela, and listeners react with fury. As the adventures of Martin the polar bear is canceled by out of touch radio bosses, Courtney livid sight pals throughout the two miles who was brouhaha, Dobson himself remained silent, partly, or indeed holy. This may have been because his position was indefensible. This was a pamphleteer, remember, whose sole advice on the subject of unimaginably harsh Gale swept sub zero temperatures in the frozen hell of the polar wastes was best pack a woolly in a new monograph the reputed Dobson scholar and polar explorer loopy pangloss has been through the pamphlet with a fine tooth comb. In her forward, she admits that it inconceivable to her that such a titanic figures Dobson could have written a pamphlet entirely devoid of sense. Her task she chose this window from it something anything that could in some way restore the pamphleteers reputation among the polar exploration community. triumphantly Sri alights upon Tip Number 12. We travel quote in full you might, in the unimaginably harsh Gale swept sub zero temperatures in the frozen hell of the polar waste, become peckish. If so, wrap up warm and plot out into the ice and snow until you see a polar bear. These are big Fierce Creatures, but using skill, judgment and weaponry, you should be able to kill one that doesn't drag the slaughtered polar bear back to your nice warm heart. Using an X tropic two pieces, each piece being no bigger than a baby's clenched fist sorts of trunks out by type, ie for bone, sinew, fat flesh innards, what have you. Select the trunks that look to thumb and place them in a large pot. Fill a pot with water and bring to the boil. Place a lid on the pot and let it simmer for hours. Top up the water from time to time. While it is cooking, feed the unselected lead to some trunks of polar bear raw to the Huskies. Anything they leave behind can be put into a blender and liquidized. Heat this in a pan until it's the consistency of mayonnaise. Transfer the decisively boiled polar bear trunks from the pot to a plate. Pour over the liquid from the pan as a source and tuck in. important note, however to thumb it appears on no account should you eat the polar bears liver. It is highly toxic, containing a terrifyingly high concentration of retinol in the form of vitamin A found in members of the animal kingdom. If eaten in one meal 30 to 90 grams of polar bear liver is enough to kill a human being or to make even sled dogs very ill Believe you me you will not want to come down with a case of acute hypervitaminosis a. The symptoms include drowsiness, sluggishness, irritability, severe headache, bone pain, blurred vision, vomiting, peeling skin, flaking around the mouth, full body, skin loss, liver damage, hemorrhage, coma, and death. as Miss pangloss points out, this is true. For all its faults, she can quote, Dobson's hints and tips for intrepid explorers and the polar waste out of print is not wholly worthless. We should give him credit for that. So we do.

Alfred Hitchcock was terrified of eggs. In 1963. He said, I'm frightened of eggs worse than frightened. They revolt me that white round thing without any holes. Have you ever seen anything more revolting than an egg yolk breaking and spilling it yellow liquid? Blood is jolly red. But egg yolk is yellow, revolting. I've never tasted it. This is what we can call a foolish fear. After all, why should a rich and successful film director be scared of an egg? There is nothing foolish, however, about a fear of egg heads. I do not mean egg heads in the conventional sense to denote extremely brainy persons and boffins. To be terrified of that sort of egg head would be as foolish as to be afraid of eggs. It's true that one might be frightened of a demented and power crazed egg head about to press the knob on the doomsday machine. But that's a very rare event. And in general, one is more likely to be scared by rampaging sicko barbarians than by egg heads. The egg head it is not foolish to fear is the literal egg head. I mean, it's hard to imagine something genuinely more terrifying than a human body with an egg where it's headed to be. picture it a man or a woman of average height average build average Lee dressed but with a neck tapering to a sort of egg cup formation, a top which rests an egg. Not some kind of giant human head sized egg, but a common chicken egg of the kind one buys by the half dozen in a carton. I don't know about you, but if I was sashaying along the boulevard of an important city and came face to face with such an egg head, I would run away screaming. We are used to heads that have eyes and a nose and a mouth and ears. However, arrayed fortuitously or in a somewhat lopsided manner, these are the features we associate with what we understand as a head. Human heads deformed by horrible accidents or mishaps at birth, will still largely conform to a generic headedness, as do in their own ways. The heads of beasts and birds. Some insect heads, under a microscope can appear alien and mildly alarming, but they retain a set of recognizable features with which we can become familiar and accommodate ourselves, particularly when we're reminded that they're grossly magnified and really quite tiny. It is the awful blankness of the egg head that is so unnerving and ruinous to our sanity. That smooth, fragile shell white or brown or sparsely speckled, admits of no features whatsoever. We cannot Mr. Potato Head like poke eyes and a nose and ears and a mouth into it. For in so doing we would only crack the shell. And not only is it an awful blank, but its size is out of proportion to the body atop which it rests, somehow making it all the more frightening. We must consider to that it's smooth and featureless form Rob's it of senses. Without eyes, it cannot see. Without a nose it cannot smell without ears it cannot hear without our mouth, it cannot speak. Even if we allow that within the eerie shell there may look a brain that brain would be tiny in comparison to the human brain and devoid of sensory stimulation and unimaginable horror. In short, the egghead would be akin to a zombie. It is truly the stuff of nightmares. As I count myself fortunate that I've never actually had a nightmare about egghead, I hope I never will. But it strikes me that they could well prompt nightmares in others were they to be deployed in a blockbuster horror film. Attack of the eggheads from outer space has a pleasingly 1950s ring to it.

one imagines the spaceship landing conveniently close to a major American city, and the eggheads rampaging through the streets trialing chaos in their wake. Though it is unclear how a zombie being with an egg for a head might cause harm, other than by creating terror in those who see it lumbering towards them on an otherwise uneventful sunny day. One could alternatively, devise a film from the perhaps even more terrible perspective of the egg head itself. Our hero goes to bed one night, and wakes up in the morning with an egg where his head used to be. This would be a suitable premise, not for a horror film, but for a piece of mawkish Papp starring inevitably, Robin Williams, only he I think, has the acting chops to make an audience weep the plight of an egghead Indeed, he has the talent if one can call it that to make believable a scene where the egg head itself weeps. But will it tears be yellow? This brings us back to Hitchcock. Had he not been such a scaredy cat about eggs, he would surely have made the definitive egg head film, egg Hedo perhaps, or egg heads by egg heads West, or to catch an egg head or the 39 egg heads. Or dial E for egg head. Or the man who knew too many egg heads or egg heads on a train or the wrong egg head or egg head bound or the egg head vanishes or shadow of an egg head or even just the egg heads. Hitchcock being Hitchcock, there would no doubt have been seen where Tippi Hedren gets splattered with egg yolk or would it be revealed that her blond hair is neither blonde nor hair but an eruption of thin strings of egg yolk from what in a heart thumping Lee suspenseful scene we discover is not Tippi Hedren the human head at all, but an egghead

more about the world of cinema now, because next month or the month after, or possibly the month after that any right before the year's end Fingers crossed. God willing, there will be a rare chance to see the early films of the fanatical true tonic auteur Horst gak. The pointy town Film Festival is devoting a fortnight to a little scene but legendary works, including lolloping around a pond, prancing around a lake, and mincing around a reservoir. With that bright, gaudy color photography, lurking camera movements, and deafening soundtracks of power band power ballad cover versions. These are the films that put Horst gak on the map. At the time, he was alone on that map, a tiny, isolated speck in a vast wilderness, much of which remained blank. It still does say for a few tentative scratches on blocks, where previously there was an awful void. The Critic Gilbert's dot contends that, and I quote, Horst gak brought to the filmic circumnavigation of inland bodies of water, a brutal, even murderous intensity never before seen in the cinema, or indeed in the real world. Unquote. Certainly, there's something hallucinatory about these films, which feature some of the great stars of the time, dressed in costumes designed by some of the great costume designers of the time. The director's use of state of the art night vision technology developed by the military in bright and battering sunlight, with Vaseline smeared on the camera lens only adds to the unprecedented visual feast. The pointy town season also allows us to track the development of Horst ghacks aesthetic, with the first ever screening of the previously presumed lost getting towards a bog. Here, he cast aside the motif of circumnavigation and has his star approach the inland body of water. But importantly, it's an adulterated body of water of vile bog, a vile, vile, the vilest bog, his location scouts were able to find we, the audience are only granted a glimpse of it after much gathering in the final nanoseconds of the film. It is a revelation of a peculiar a gak esque kind. Gilbert dalt when asked to define the term gak ask, burst into tears. pressed for an answer. His sobbing and weeping became evermore convulsive, his breathing grew labored, he shook, he broke out in a cold sweat, he matched his false teeth, he rent his government, he palpitating there was the appearance of a ball in his throat. He gave signs of suffocating his legs gave way and he collapsed onto the street from where he was scooped up by a passing film buff, who cradled him in her arms as he lapsed into a coma. I was reminded Tintin tantum of bellinis pietta of 1472. I was reminded to have Horst ghacks theoretical Si, the collapsed film critic, I creed occur with galvanized a small and indeed negligible band of artists, poets, filmmakers and trances when it appeared in the journal, intemperate ravings by Horst ghac. Early in his career, the director had carved out a niche for himself from which he could not be dislodged. Was it a blessing or a curse that niche that resistance to dislodgement? The pointy town film festival season will give us an opportunity to judge if we so wish, but there are many cineastes who will stay away in a half.

For them Horst gak can never be forgiven. For the volt fast he performed with the release of his middle period extravaganza can Hieronymus Merkin ever forget mercy hump and find true happiness Redux a shot for shot remake of Anthony Newley in 1969 musical starring Anthony Newley, Connie kreski, Joan Collins, Milton Berle, George Jessel, Patricia Hayes, stubby K. Victor springhetti, and Bruce Forsyth. So closest to the original that when the films were shown back to back, only one critic out of 20 was able to say, which was which guild but dot was that critic and I would dearly like to ask him how he perceived what 19 others could not, but he remains comatose and cradled in the street. Apparently, he is contractually bound to remain in situ, along with his kreidler until such time as Horst gatx has flown in and set up his cameras and film the unconscious critic in extremists. Industry gossip has it that the director has embarked on a series of film adaptations of his early critical essays. Some will denounce faces, self referential navel gazing of the worst kind, but they're unlikely to say so to horse gags face. Ah, that face. It was the subject of his next feature after the Anthony Newley remake of four and a half hour musical entitled horse ghacks face a hootenanny. Much of the music was recycled from Hieronymus Merkin, adapted for frantic and deranged Appalachian bound dance arrangements. The camera lingers on Horst ghacks face film using state of the art night vision technology developed by the military in Brighton battering sunlight with Vaseline smeared on the lens. Several critics Gilbert dot among them have called it the most frightening film in the history of cinema. It is perhaps pertinent that it was produced by hammer studios. There are rumors so far unconfirmed that Horst gak himself will attend the festival for a q&a session after the showing of the final film in the season. This is his foray into what he called cinematic terrorism, the notorious and notoriously lengthy Hitchcock with eggs with not a job of permission from Alfred Hitchcock's a state. In fact, quite the opposite horse gak joined together into a single film, The directors entire Canon and inserted an egg into every single scene. Technically brilliant and absolutely terrifying. It was condemned by Gilbert dot among others as pointless, toothless, and a something great insult to the master of suspense. For responsively hit caucus state is not suitable for family listening. Although the precise date of the pointy town Film Festival is still up in the air, I understand that queues are already forming outside the ticket booth in the pointy town. zippity doo dar dancehall scout Hatton cinema, whether those queuing have the faintest idea of what they're letting themselves in for is not for me to say.

That's the end of this week's show. I just have time to mention. Apparently, we can see the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic is coming up, of course next week. And so there's been Titanic related stuff all over the place, including lots of things on television. And the thing that I noticed on BBC One, there's a short series of programs called Titanic with Len Goodman, Mr. Goodman being one of the judges from Strictly Come Dancing as a very curious combination of presenter and subject. And I wonder if we can look forward to Hindenburg with Alicia Dixon. The Munich air disaster with Bruno Tonioli the Tay bridge disaster with Craig revel Horwood certainly is an earthquake with Arlene Phillips and perhaps the Black Death with test daily. Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, that's hooting yard for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it learned a lot about Alfred Hitchcock films and some good dot read vices should you slaughter a polar bear. Yeah, that's it. Really. Bye bye.
