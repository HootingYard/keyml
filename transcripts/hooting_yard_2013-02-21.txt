At an advanced stage the gunk is scraped off with a tallow knife collected in a pot reduced by steaming and fed to seahorses. Oh sorry, I should have explained. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frankie and this is resonance 104 point four FM. Anyway As I was saying, at an advanced stage, the gunk is scraped off with a tallow knife collected in a pot reduced by steaming and fed to seahorses. After several days, the seahorses begin to display intricate and abnormal behavior patterns. These patterns can be traced on graph paper with propelling pencils and a ruler. Comparison with earlier graphs down under a double blind test have proved immensely illuminating. So lustrous indeed that copied out onto onion skin paper and crumpled up, they can be inserted into glass bulbs and light a long corridor in a large building for upwards of four days. By the fourth day they are dimming there is a dying of the light and sensitive persons mourn as more than they might. Having disposed of the gunk as described the main bulk is best fed through a sieve. The most effective safe to use is one with so called Sweden bourgie and Angel holes. These are not generally available in the shops, but can be ordered direct by post from the manufacturers, thus keeping costs surprisingly low. You might want to purchase two or three at one time. The fragile nature of the Save means that it will not alas survive much use. It is easily distressed, especially when you try to force stuff through the holes as certain boisterous and reckless persons tend to do. If you have such a person on your team, it's a good idea to keep them away from the sibs by telling them to go and keep an eye on the seahorses. Other pesky or exasperating team members can be usefully employed and kept out of your hair by laying the plumb line. This should consist of 10 tent pegs and butcher string and stretch as far as the eye can see. The line should ideally be at the height of an average hollyhock the calculation being made by consulting the tables at the back of the annual hollyhock height register. A copy of this ought to be in your local reference library, but will usually not be available for borrowing. So a literate and numerate member of the team with a valid library ticket should be delegated to copy out the required details. They can use the back of the graph paper on which the behavior patterns of the seahorses have earlier been inscribed in majestic sweeping lines and arcs of unsurpassed beauty. Meanwhile, having fed the main bolt through the sieve into a bucket, the bucket can now be ferried to the platform. This should stand on sturdy props. The sturdy is a better do not on any account. Use balsa wood. You're probably familiar with the case of Tarleton and what transpired with his balsa wood props. If necessary, test the sturdiness using the standard test of sturdiness, which appear as appendix seven in your pamphlet. Otherwise, proceed directly to the siphon and funnel pallava. siphon the stuff out of the bucket working slowly and methodically and seamlessly. as it passes through the funnel. take snapshots at one minute intervals from the designated angles. These need not be full color snapshots unless they've been explicitly specified in the contract. That certainly an unusual clause nowadays, and if it does appear it's worth checking. The contract might after all, have been drawn up by a half wit. Try to ensure that no seahorses are visible in the background of the snapshots.

The whole lot cipher the scraped off gunk should now have been transferred into beakers without spillage, aligning the beakers along the plumb line once they're in place and only When they are in place, attach the snap on snap off lid. Using a thick, bold black indelible marker pen, draw identifying symbols on the lids. For examples of apt symbols, see appendix nine. Make sure each one is different. There is often a temptation to repeat the seahorse symbol because it's so factoring. Fight against this temptation with all your might like Christ in the wilderness. In case of rainfall, it will be necessary to cover both beakers and plumb line with tarpaulins. The approved color is an almost transparent light blue, any other color is likely to result in fewer points being awarded without the right of appeal. Again, the case of Tarleton should give you pause if you're thinking of using black or yellow tarpaulin or, God forbid a particularly opaque one. It was not amusing when Carlton had to account for himself before the panel. The see who the seahorse is tiny brains will by now be utterly ravaged, scoop them from the tank with a standard anglers net and deposit them on the slab one by one. Using a very sharp kitchen knife, remove the brain from each seahorse. If you feel pangs of pity in your soul, you're pursuing the wrong hobby, and would be better off taking up ping pong. Place the brains in a brown paper bag, twist the top of the bag to seal it and then swing it around your head several times while you lighting an incantation. It is important to note that this step is essentially meaningless. So you need not put a great deal of effort into it. But it's always a good idea to show willing, you do not know who is watching and listening. holding the bag in your right hand, walk the length of the plumb line pausing at each speaker. At each pause, gaze mournfully into the middle distance, your lips trembling, some of the feathers in your headrest may fall to the ground, you should disregard them, while at the same time being very careful not to tread on them as you resume your walk towards the next beaker along the line. That is unless they're Sparrow feathers, in which case, you should pick them up and put them in your pocket. But that of course should go without saying as it is blindingly obvious, if you've got this far.

That was an extract from the book of significant tomfoolery by the master. And before I forget, I should mention that the annual resonance fundraiser is still going on.

And no one does and we depend upon the station depends upon your donations. So please be generous. Anyway, here's here's a letter. Dear uncle Istvan. Thank you for sending me a box of flies musca domestica. I'm sad to report that most of them perished in transit. The few that survived are recuperating and I have put them on a visit. enriched diet. I hope they will soon be hale and hearty enough to serve as proper objects of study. As I cram for my forthcoming entomology examinations. The institute needs new blood. The doctor is very comfortable and the surrounding woods are beautiful. The Silver birches are silvery and Berkeley and the spruces have been spruced up by old aleg. You remember old aleg, the groundsman? Even though he now get to bout on one leg and the stick, he still has a spring in his step. I do not know exactly what he did to the spruces to spruce them up. And of course, if I asked him, I would not understand his reply, that he still talks in that lovable barbaric clickety clackety language with lots of spitting. I do not think he has washed his hair since the last time you were here in the twilight years of the Tsar before last. Thanks again for the flies. I will put the box they came in to good use your loving nephew, Zoltan.

Frank Key  11:24
dear uncle his fan, it was extremely thoughtful of you to send me another box of flies musca domestica but really not necessary. The survivors from the first batch are now almost fully recovered their vitamin enriched diet further enriched with anabolic steroids on the advice of old Mark kropotkin. You remember old Mark kropotkin the housekeeper. She is now almost totally blind, but still as sharp as a button. It was she who suggested I punch a couple of holes in the box from the first batch of flies and looper boot lace through them and wear it as a hat. I call it my Dhaka hat, I will have to ask her what to do with this new box. Sadly, once again, very few of the Flies survive the rigors of their journey. I am going to write a stiff letter to the postal authorities. I have now been given the date of my examination. So I hope to be able to study the living flies from both boxes before then. Otherwise, I shall have to rely on the rather blurred illustrations in the encyclopedia. If I can find it. Are you sure it is at the data. The only book I have spotted is a guide to pursuing and shooting wolves from a helicopter. The poplars and larches in the woods are looking as spruce as the spruce is thanks to old aleg. He is now getting about on two sticks after a mishap the other day with a bear trap. Thanks again for the extra flies. You're loving nephew, Zoltan

Frank Key  13:16
de uncle is fine. Thank you so much for the box of flies you sent. I think that is now three boxes. Unfortunately, this time every single fly was dead on arrival. Clearly my letter to the postal authorities failed to prompt the root and branch reform of mascota musca domestica package handling I hoped for. Not to worry However, because the surviving flies from the first two boxes are thriving, to say the least. Old Mark kropotkin added strontium 90 to their vitamin, an anabolic steroid enriched diet, and they have now grown to what unseemly size and where before they were sunk in lassitude. Their energy levels now are terrifying. Almost as terrifying as the energy levels of old aleg, who has been sprucing up the use and Sycamores in spite of the fact that he has lost the use of one of his arms. Last week he had a mishap with a chainsaw. I'll mark kropotkin has been rubbing one of her mysterious undulant into his stump. Oh, by the way, she came up with a splendid use for the second box. It has been cut in half and the two halves glued to my data hat, one on each side to act as earflaps I expect you will think have something to do with the third box. Thanks again for the flies musca domestica so you really need not go out of your way to send any more your life Nephew, Zoltan dear uncle his fan. Many thanks for sending me a fourth box of flies musca domestica thank god they were all dead. I implore you not to send me more. Luckily, just before old all eggs latest mishap, he still had the ability to wheel hammer and nails and planks, and he kindly barricaded me into the pantry of the data. As he drove the last nail home, I heard his lovable barbaric clickety clackety language become a deranged and hideous screaming as he was beset by the flies. They are now enormous and frenzied and radioactive, pumped up by the vitamins and anabolic steroids. And strontium 90, old Mark kropotkin has been feeding them. The once beautiful data is now splattered with their noxious regurgitation. I'll mark kropotkin herself has been feeding on the same diet, and he's half housekeeper half fly the blind Queen of the swarm. Please send help as soon as you receive this letter. I do not know how sturdy the barricades are. I think the flies are matting for an attack. Oh god. They're breaking through. Under the flaps of my backer hat. My ears are assailed by their infernal buzzing. God help.

There is a vague possibility I might have read that last piece on the show before. Apologies if I have but I don't think I did. Anyway, if I did read it before I read it slightly differently. That's pretty much the end of the show for this week. I was going to tell you about the popular television situation comedy program. Are you being savaged? But that can wait until next week? I think. So that's the end of hooting yard. Don't forget, you've still got a few hours to go to the auction at resonance fm.com slash auction 2013. do go and bid on items among which among which items are the 1989 paperback twitching and shattered. A I'm terrified to realize that is now 24 years ago that that book was published. But it's a wonderful paperback book, collecting some early works of Mr. Key and has a great a three fold out diagram and a piece of real sandpaper in it. So can't can't be missed really go and bid for that. And I'll be back next week. Bye bye. Oh, and the book is signed by the way. It was signed the other day. Yeah. Anyway, that's it. Bye bye.
