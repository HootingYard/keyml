Hello, this is resonance follow 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. I read something online the other day where someone commented somewhere in some forum or blog or whatever about this show, and said that they enjoy it very much enjoyed listening to me babbling, but the entire show was ruined for them because every time I stopped talking this I can't remember the precise words but it was something like god awful. din that passes for music is played in between. And it's so horrible. I can't listen to it and have to clap my hands over my ears. Can't tell that's a slap happy and Henry cow. I'd like the theme music myself I occasionally think of changing it. But I can never quite work out what to change it to. Anyway, I opened my briefcase and took from it my Bolshevik tomato paste scoop. I was so pleased with it. I'd snapped it up on eBay, where it was going for a song. The song I opted for was essays on pigs 1968 by Hans van a hinter. Strictly speaking, this is actually five separate songs. So but I got away with it. The Bolshevik tomato paste scoop arrived in the post four days later, I will be sure to take it with me in my briefcase on my forthcoming trip by hot air balloon to the last city of Karen Carpenter, far far away beyond the mountains of madness, where Knight penguins fringer yawning abyss.

Ever since it ended after eight seasons in 2012, fans of the television comedy drama Desperate Housewives have been hoping for a sequel. Now it appears their prayers have been answered. Next month sees the launch of a brand new television comedy drama called disparate horseflies set on a horse named Wisteria. The show features the amusing and sometimes not so amusing antics of a group of horse flies who live parasitically upon it Shanks, withers fetlocks and other parts of a horse which I'm sure you can list for yourselves. As the title implies, the flies are a varied bunch apart from their or being flies of the horse fly family tabernas. Suit tonus I can't I can't see properly to read that. Anyway, something like that. The cast comprises several actual horseflies specially trained to act by Tip Top thespian fly trainer Cedric fly train for the setting of Wisteria and elegant if to Burke and a horse named Keith resident and a stables in vile shear was employed. Preview tapes have not been made available, but word has it that the first episode includes close up scenes of grotesque horsefly behavior, which some viewers and horses may find absolutely sickening.

There was a great letter in a recent issue of standpoint magazine, which I will read the letter in its entirety. I didn't make a note of the name of the person who wrote in which I should have done. But this is the kind of lesson I enjoy reading. Whenever I'm feeling a little low, I call to mine the Sunday morning 30 odd years ago, waiting in a queue in a shop in Aruba, Macedonia, the gentleman at the head of the queue wearing shorts and sandals with long white socks. Bear mode, the lady behind the counter, just we so when he invents three albums he am on Sunday Telegraph made me laugh. Also, unrelated actually, Andy Martin, of the tyrannical leader of unit, wrote to me to tell me that he had recently been reading or trying to read a textbook on recent development in mathematics. Its pages, he said, are littered with sentences and phrases, which often sound as if they've been swiped from one of the earlier pamphlets by Norman Davis, who wrote further science, the book that many listeners will be familiar with, as I often read bits out of further science. And Andy Martin has Andy Martin has listed some of the inexplicable yet curiously compelling phrases he digested from the from this book on recent developments in mathematics. these are these are phrases, which I've just cobbled together into a list degeneracy on our manifold lemmas on ordinary differential operators with parameters, sharp regularity estimates for the solution of the oblique derivative problem, instability mode in benard systems, co dimension to bifurcation bifurcations. The basic boundary value problems for operators with V m o coefficients, time dependent and time independent wavepacket approaches to reactive scattering laser excited wave packets in semiconductor heterostructures flashback resonances and singular Hodge theory, elliptic complexes of pseudo differential operators and stratified media singular interaction problems with distribution and hyperfunction data. Polar materials without director symmetry, the mechanical fragility of symmetric bookshelf structure, quantum dot hetero structures Eiger oscillations in diffraction theory molecular integral evaluation material tensors of ranks two to seven multi configurational self consistent field and coupled clusters orientational aspects in pair transfer and multi chromo for ICT systems the Stokes parameters in nonlinear media and self action polarization phenomena canonical quantification and caustic wave functions quantum states of both Sonic systems, phase space distribution functions and the density operator. So, you're probably also profoundly concerned about the mechanical fragility of smectic bookshelves structure. If you know what that is, please write in and tell me and I'll pass it on to Andy Martin.

After writing dozens and dozens of books self help guru Dr. Bruce terrific has had an epiphany. It was always my aim to write more books than Tony Buzan. He said in an interview with Buse antastic news magazine. And having achieved that goal, I thought it was time to strike off in a new direction. It also dawned on me that my self help books serve only to increase the navel gazing narcissism of readers who can't see further than their own petty and squalid lives. Christ almighty, isn't it high time people stop helping themselves and instead helped others. That's why I'm launching a new series of self help books. For too long elves, fairies and laughing gnomes have had to fend for themselves. While those days are over. From now on, my readers are going to be instructed in the best ways to devote themselves to the care and feeding of elves beat that Tony Buzan. The first book in the series, elf help for idiots explained how to download an elf pointy hat when it becomes frayed.

Am I on? Okay. Peter solstad famously asked, Where do you go to my lovely when you're alone in your bed? The simple answer to this question is that he's lovely isn't going anywhere. She's in bed quite possibly asleep. Why then would the singer whose first wife was a dentist pose the query in the first place? We can posit several solutions to this conundrum. And it's well worth doing so for reasons which ought to be obvious and obvious, not only to the spouses of dentists, but to the general population. Also. One theory propounded by veteran SAS dentists to loopy tin hat is that the question mark ought to appear after my lovely and that when you're alone in your bed is a new separate sentence, the beginning of a rumination quite distinct from the opening query. In this reading, Peter solstad is about to make certain observations regarding his lovely in her bed, but he's interrupted before he's able to complete the sentence. Tin hat suggest the singer spoke from the dentist chair when his wife was about to perform a tooth extraction and told him to open wide just as he uttered the word bed 10 hats theory one broad support among the my lovely community until it was comprehensively demolished by research allows whelk using dental records, slow down tape recordings and a fiercely forensic brain welke demonstrated beyond sensible argument that tin hat had no idea what he was talking about. more persuasive perhaps is the argument laid out over several coruscating paragraphs by Ned cake boy, in a paper published in the Journal of dental hygiene and Peter sarstedt studies, volume 24 number 11. pointing out that just as doctors got get sick and require the administration's of other doctors, so dentists call on other dentists to faff about with their teeth when necessary. He goes on to claim that the bed in which my lovely is alone is a hospital bed on wheels or casters. She is about to undergo particularly complex dental treatment, and has been wheeled in her bed from her Ward to a dental operating theatre. Peter sassanid paying a visit to the dentist lovely born of oak seriousness, armed probably with a bouquet of flowers arrives at the dental hospital to discover that she is not as he's opposed in her ward. Where did she go to he wonders? I said that with several possible solutions to account for the singer asking such a seemingly stupid question, and I've tackled two of them. That's quite enough for the time being. In any case, these matters become decidedly more baffling when we consider that Peter solstad second wife was not a dentist

The only sound to tear the night comes from the man upstairs is bloated belching figures stops, he may crash through the ceiling soon. If he does, so, the sound will cease. He will be buying on his back on my carpet, covered in a film of dust and powder and debary I will cast upon him a look of reproach and poke him with the pointy stick I keep the hand for circumstances such as these, he may grunt if still alive or not, if dead.

When I prod his neck I will dislodge from around it a delicate silver train to which is attached a medallion. It bears a depiction of a saint, identified by a man and by an inscription as sent Agger. I will be tempted to kick the bloated Beltre in the head on account of his stupidity. Is he not aware that this so called site is a figment of the marketing department of a French cheese making concern? Not for the first time, I will be driven crackers by the blistering ignorance of my neighbors. As Dylan observed, it's a wonder that they still know how to breed. The Belcher from upstairs splayed on my carpet may or may not be breathing, but the sound of his stomping, mercifully done with will now be replaced by the roaring of an idiot wind. Wild is the wind and I hear the sound of mandolins can a man get no peace and quiet in this determinable Urbis. I will retreat to my kitchen for Faenza can marmalade somewhere I have a packet of 20 number six, but no light. I will rifle through the pockets of the bloated get on my carpet. I will give him a kicking as I do so. But he is not there. He did not after all crash through the ceiling. The stomping of his bloated belching finger remains the only sound until last daybreak, and it is joined by twittering birdsong and the clink and Clank of the milkman on his morning rounds. milkmen, milkman, bring me curds and whey. No, there is nothing for you today. No milk, no way. No curds, no cream go crashed through the ceiling of your dream. And there are references in that page two s angle B Dylan and Washington and P strohmeyer. Got side.

Now we're having a slight technical problem here. Or at least I am. I want to read something else to you. But if I have time, I sort of have plenty of time. But there's all sorts of issues out here. I'll actually be able to read some more.

Yes, a lonely, he made a companion of string and wood and tin and sat her at his window as if you were looking out. And whenever he returned from tiresome drones, she was there, framed in the window to welcome him home. But when he was at home, she had a back turn to him. She was facing the outside world in mobile yet desperate to go frolicking digitally into that world where other things of spring and wood and tin were surely to be found.

Here's another piece completely different. at the hotel, the bellhop had implanted in his head the brain of a cat. His own brain had been removed. and sat in preserving jelly in a jar on a shelf in a cupboard in a lab. It was a locked lab, the only kita which was kept in the pocket of the Mad crazed lunatic boffin who had carted off the brains carried out the brain swap during a thunderstorm on the previous Tuesday. This boffin habitually assumed the guise of a janitor and perform janitorial duties, the better hoodwinked to hoodwink ease of whom there were several dotted about the site from the parking attendant to the secretary at the secretary app consisted of butter single Secretary into whose head the buffing implant planned to insert the brain of a badger having first removed the Secretary's actual brain and placed it in preserving jelly in a jar on a shelf in another cupboard in the lab. He calculated that the use of two different cupboards would prevent him from muddling up the two different brains, the bellhops and the secretaries. Each cupboard was itself locked as locked as the lab and the boffin janitor thus had three keys to cope with. Do anybody unlettered in the art and science of locksmith theory, that is to say, to as near as dammit every single person present upon our gayby rotating planet alive or dead. The three keys appeared to be identical, or at least so similar one to another, but they could not be told apart. Thus, I think to each key by houpt length of cord cut from a boot lace was a small rectangle of cardboard on a rectangle was written in a bio shortly to be exhausted of its ink, in draftsmanship, staggering and its delicacy, as if learned and perfected in an earlier century when penmanship counted for something among the educated classes, and surely too beautiful for the usual effusions of the humble borrow. An indication of the lock the attached key was designed to unlock the labeling of the keys was simple, and that's resistant to misunderstanding by anyone but a halfway lab cupboard with red door cupboard with yellow door. The buffing janitor could think of no circumstance that might cause him to muddle the keys, save for the unscheduled re painting of the cupboard doors in different colors over a bank holiday weekend by contractors hired and brought in from some area beyond janitorial control. That such a thing could happen was so egregious that he tossed the idea aside, much as one might toss a possible bitty Bob down or well worth one passing by a well clutching a busy pub, which one had no use. There was a well in a field between the hotel and the lab. The buffing janitor passed it on most working days, but had never tossed anything into it. No one had nobody drawn any water from it, for he could not it was a dry well, it had been dry for some years, by dint of subterranean engineering work, not unconnected to the construction of the carpark and then the lab and another larger, more distressingly bleak carpark that served the hotel. The work had been carried out in their underground phase by a team of what used to be called nappies, the brain of each of whom had been removed and in its place implanted the brain of a mole. All the removed brains had been stored in preserving jelly in jars on shelves in cupboards in the lab. But one night malfeasance that occurred conducted by highly organized ne'er do wells. It was on the morning after this enormity that the boffin janitor went tootling into the nearest village to parlay with a locksmith. In reporting these matters, it may be that I've got some of the details wrong. I was drifting off to sleep when my partner told me the tale which he himself had heard from an old pal of his a frequent guest in many in hotel, a traveling salesman who dealt in exotic rugs and carpets, whose name I seem to recall, was gi gurdjieff.

Finally this week, pity me, oh people of Switzerland. I am a Swiss soldier, and I languish in a Swiss dungeon under sentence of death, my crime. I sang in a public square, the milking song Kuya rayon, and fast I was condemned. I broke the law. And now I must pay the price. for comfort in my cold Swiss subterranean sell, I clutched to my cheek, the babe of some bibbity did did. There is a story to tell of how this sacred relic came into my possession. It is not a particularly interesting story, but I will tell it anyway, to pass the time before I'm dragged from my dungeon to the giblet and hanged by the neck until I am justly dead. There were a half dozen of us sex with soldiers camped on a hill above us with village orders were to await the dawn and then to charge screaming down to the village until late waste. Doing so we were told, would bring us one step closer to victory over our phones. And so we charged and so we screamed and so we laid waste, and among the buildings to which we laid waste with the village church, and then the sacristy of this church was kept in a big jeweled casket, the bed of sand bibley. Did did. Was it the real bid? Or was it one of the dozens even hundreds of counterfeit bibs thought to be held in parishes throughout the cantons of Switzerland? We did not know. We were rough toughs with soldiers, not men of God. That is why in deciding which of us should carry off the bib as his war prize, we cleared the surface of the altar in the village church a bit totally brick a BRAC, and played a game of cards upon it. We played my ladies putting under knockout rules. And I was the last Swiss soldier standing. And so I was given first dibs on some bibbity babe Dibs babe. I will carry it with me to the place of Swiss execution if they will let me whether they do or do not at this hour of my death, pity me, people of Switzerland.

What you should know is that that story is based on fact, which is that Swiss soldiers who were were said to be particularly susceptible to the style job, which led to all sorts of problems. And when they were particularly susceptible when I heard a particular Swiss milking song Kuya rayon, and therefore singing or playing it was punishable by death. So there you go. That's, that's in a in a piece I read about the term nostalgia, which was invented in 18. Sorry, 1688 by a doctor called johanne Hofer, who was treating young Swiss mercenary soldiers suffering from a strange set of symptoms. I didn't I wouldn't eat couldn't some of the world's 11 sometimes became dangerously ill. I had fainting Fitz, high fevers and indigestion. After talking to the young men Hofer realized they were simply ill for want of home. When he sent them back to the Swiss mountains. They invariably recovered. Yeah, there you go. Anyway, that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope to be back next week. decrepitude permitting, and until then, fairly well.
