Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. couple of minutes later than advertised true to in comprehensively complicated shenanigans. But here Here is the show now. Last week it well since last week's show, I spent some time as usual updating my log of outer space man's cardboard reality interventions. Those of you who read the hooting your blog, probably are aware of these already. They're on the assets the inexplicable world of outer space man as a link to that website on hooting yard. And every day this year, since the first of January, after Spaceman has been placing a cardboard sign somewhere, usually where he lives around Bognor Regis, but occasionally in London and other places. Anyway. Yeah, so there's now you know quite a few of these cardboard reality interventions that commonly My practice is to log the details of each intervention on a piece of cardboard, and then to stow the piece of cardboard away in a cardboard box and forget about it. Cardboard reality intervention number 187. However, haunted My thoughts are night and day, until I felt impelled to take the lid off the cardboard box and remove the piece of cardboard on which I had locked the details. I propped it up against the similar but empty cardboard box in my fasti parlor to keep it within my purview at all times. Or at least those times when I was indoors. Depressed horse never knew source buns. reads the legend on intervention number 187. Where had I heard those words in that order before? Was it the title piece in a slim volume of twee verse by Dennis beer pint? Was it a chapter heading from a best selling paperback potboiler by pebble head? Or can it be the code phrase uttered by international woman of mystery Primrose dent to gain access to her secret subterranean headquarters. Luckily, there are reference books Excuse me. Luckily, there are reference books where one can look up that sort of thing. So I looked them up. That is I looked up beer pint and pebble head and Primrose dent in a biographical reference book, but grew none the wiser. I then consulted reference works on depression, horses and source buns, still to no avail. Yet the word continued to swirl around in my brain, their origin tantalizingly out of reach. Previously on hooting yard, as I say in the American television series, when faced with such quandary, as I have stocked off into the deep, dense dark woods of Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo, and sought the counsel of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman, that freakish, Crone is a dab hand in the arts of recovered memory syndrome. And more than one she's brought bubbling to the surface of my cranium material, which might otherwise have remained forever obscure and buried. On this occasion, however, my people learn from her people that the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman had gone on her holidays to some benighted and dilapidated seaside resort to suck sticks of rock and commune with seagulls in bird language from the balcony of her seashore chalet. It came as something of a surprise to me to learn that the eldritch hag took holidays like normal people do. And as I am ill equipped to deal with surprises of any nature. I took to my bed for 48 hours, tossing and turning and whimpering weekly as illusory phantasms gambled and frolicked across the ceiling of my booth while the Buddha adjoins the fasty parlor, and by keeping the door open. I was able to pair the piece of cardboard propped against the empty cardboard box upon which I had loved the details of intervention number 187, including, of course, those haunting words. By the time I was ready to face the world again, I had resolved to try to forget all about the depressed horse that

never knew saucepans. The first step in my forgetting was to put the piece of cardboard back in the cardboard box where all my cardboard signage loggings was stored. But I made the mistake of preparing a snack before so doing. It was not the cream crackers with jam hinged me as they have done before. No, it was the processed trees triangle I took from the refrigerator, intending it as an accompaniment to be spread upon the cream crackers with a spatula. I did not even get as far as I'm wrapping the processed cheese triangle transfixed as I was by the illustration on its wrapper of a laughing cow. perversely, perhaps, the sight of a happy cow made me think immediately of a depressed horse. I replaced the process trees triangle and opened an uneaten in the refrigerator and shoveled the cream crackers into my mouth, one by one, chewing them to a pulp, and reflected sadly that until I could discover where in the name of all that is holy, I had first encountered the words, depressed horse never knew saucepans tormented me would never know rest. You'll be familiar with the phrases barrack room lawyer and pub philosopher. Well, later that day, I fell into conversation with a milkbar Jesuit. He had the appearance, character, mental agility, wildness, black soutine, and fanatical religious commitment of a Jesuit. Yet he was a mere habituate of the milk bar into which I popped to get a glass of milk with which to wash down my cream crackers snack. He was sitting at a table, drawing on his a line with a piece of chalk, as if he were about to mesmerize a duck. A Jesuit tickle trick was practiced on the 27th of April 1871. by Gerard Manley Hopkins, an actual Jesuit. There were no ducks to be seen in the milk bar, however, and when he invited me to sit at the empty place opposite his I accepted. With his pincer like brain, he rapidly grasped that I was a troubled soul. And before the milk boss Givi had brought me my glass of milk, I found I was pouring out those troubles. It is good that you did not stray down a pagan path by unburdening your soul to the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman in the deep, dense dark woods of Whoo hoo hoo Dee Woo. He said, when I had finished telling the tally of my woes, by which time my milk had arrived in a smudge and greasy glass, it seems to me He continued, there are two ways to approach the problem. If problem it is, oh, I asked between slurps of milk. First, he said, it could be that the laughing cow on the wrapping of your process trees triangle holds the key to the conundrum. It is certainly worth investigating the possibility that there exists somewhere on this continent or one of the others and manufacturer of soul spins whose emblem is a depressed cow. Find that manufacturer and you find the source of the phrase that haunts you. I nodded my agreement, but protested that I had already consulted a large number of reference books without coming upon a mention of any such source brand manufacturer. He chuckled jG critically. Well, no work of references truly exhaustive, not even the Bible, he said, that would be a good place to start. In the King James Version. For example, there are 43 mentions of horse and 109 of horses. And while it's true that one more search in vain for the word depressed, and saucepan, it would be well to follow up the 106 instances of Whoa, whoa, the 22 of pot and the 15 of pots. I would prefer that the difference between a depressed horse that never knew source burns, and a woebegone horse that never knew pots is purely academic.

I was about to express my surprise that a Jesuit would call on the authority of the King James Version. Rather than say the do I Bay Bible favored by Catholics, but then I recalled that he was only a milkbar Jesuit, not a real one. It also occurred to me that surprised as I was, if only momentarily, I remained eerily calm and in no danger whatsoever of having to collapse back into my bed for a further 48 hours. You said there were two ways to approach the problem. I said, What is the second? I hope your question does not indicate the use of dismissed out of hand by recommendation that you seek the answer in the holy book, he wrapped back. No, I said, I'll track down all the whoa and horse and pot references as you suggest, but it's fair to say I don't hold out much hope. Very well. He said, stapling his fingers together as if in prayer and resting his chin upon them. The second approach is as follows. look very carefully at these lines in chalk I have drawn upon the milk bar table. I did so and was mesmerized just like Hopkins duck. And it was while I was thus in trounced that the milkbar Jesuit vouchsafed to me the reason for my nagging sense that somewhere before I had heard or read the words depressed horse never knew source burns. laughably my first surmise had been almost correct. It was the title of a Dennis beer, pine pollen. But the title of a poem that we the power Tasker had not yet written, not even conceived within that fluffing poetic brain inside his head. How then, could I already know it? Well, when he snapped me out of the trance, the milk bow Jesuit revealed himself as an aficionado of beer pint. My compadre in that little fellowship of admirers who's buzzing and Twinings on the so called beer pint, oh sphere, keep track of everything. Yes, everything even tangentially relevant to the poet and his doings. Even his dreams. Dennis beer pint had dreamed of writing a poem entitled, depressed horse never knew source burns, and I had dreamed of his dream, and someone else had bounced or banged my dream on their own beer pint Oh, blabber blob. At last it all made sense. I drained the last mouthful of milk from my glass stood up a bit the milk bar Jesuit farewell. As I crashed out the door into the street. I saw in the distance a duck pond, several ducks waddling their way slowly towards the milk bar. It seemed there were to be further mesmeric revelations before the day was done. I smiled at the thought quite quite unlike a depressed horse and headed for home and my laughing cow.

I have a letter from poppy Nisbett read as follows Dear Mr. Key I've been commissioned to write a book entitled 50 anecdotes about cream crackers, and to date I have managed to find only two true life cream cracker related stories which are even mildly entertaining in your piece on the cardboard sign, depressed horse and never knew saucepans. You said it was not the cream crackers with john hinged me as they have done before. I would be very interested to know about the earlier unhinged moment to which you allude as it could provide invaluable material for my book. You will sincerely Papi Nesbitt. Well copy in his bit poppy Nesbitt. I am happy to oblige as they used to sing in the old folk song poppy Nesbitt. To ensure my replies as helpful as possible. I consulted my papers to Winkle out each and every cream cracker on Hyndman reference. And I found that there is not just the one incident to report, but several. Before going into any detail, I think it's important to point out that in these unhinged moments, there is no connection whatsoever in either a literal or legal or moral or incoherent sense between the snack foods treat commonly known as a cream cracker, a sort of glorified water biscuit and the use of the word crackers as a euphemism for mad, crazy nuts, insane, deranged, been designed, or indeed, unhinged. I'm glad we've cleared that one up at the outset. I know from experience that all sorts of misunderstandings can occur when readers think that there is a link either fearsomely strong as with an iron chain, or more fragile as with a gossamer thread between the snack food and the mental or emotional condition that there can be such a link I do not deny. Consider for example, the case of the German railway sleeping car attendant rebellious, who was driven crackers by crackers by dint of the word association, just as later he was to suffer a basement in a basement and to be abused on a bus. So what he was doing about a bus when loyalty ought to have limited his mode of travel to the German railway system is a mystery. Not an ineffable mystery, perhaps such as the nature of God or the alignment of certain tree clumps, but a mystery nevertheless, and one which you pop in is bit poppy Nesbitt may wish to investigate when you finished writing 50 anecdotes about cream crackers assuming of course Do finish writing it and do not simply abandon the project through lassitude, blockage or persistent cramp. If you do abandon the book, one excuse you will not have is a lack of material, because I see I'm looking through my papers that I can furnish you with no fewer than 47 cream cracker on Hyndman Dion's as you already have to in the bag, as you say, then you need find only one more to toss up the anecdote count to a half century and foof law. There is your book done and dusted. I realize it may beggar belief that one man can lay claims of 47 separate episodes of unhinged meant by cream cracker, but I insist that I speak the truth. After all, for what possible reason would I lie to you, Poppy Nisbett poppy Nesbitt? I am unlikely to benefit from having my anecdotes retail in your book, presumably undercover of anonymity and Anna an anonymity I will wish to preserve for insurance purposes. In fact, I would suggest that you invent 47 different fictional characters to act as the suppose protagonist of the events to which I shall make you privy. You can be quite explicit about such a maneuver, by which I mean you need not pulling the wool over your readers eyes by pretending that say Mr. X or Ms. Y or Dr. Zed stand in for three different real people. You may want to make it blatantly obvious that you're using made up names by co opting 47 fictional characters who already exist invented by others, as I did when writing my as yet unpublished manuscript

47, likely fictionalized accounts of ineffably mysterious tree clump alignment shenanigans. The true life heroes and heroines of these tales are disguised by obviously fictional names.

You're quite welcome to use the very same pseudonyms in your 47 accounts of my cream cracker unhinged, although you may of course wish to pick your own or even make them up entire out of whole cloth. If that is the kind of if that is the kind of thing you like to do when fighting off latitude blockage and persistent cramps. I know I do. Earlier I described cream crackers as glorified water biscuits. It may be of interest to you poppy Nisbett, Poppy in his bit, that when looking through my papers, in addition to records of 47 unhinged mints by cream cracker, I came upon no fewer than 54 derangements by water biscuit. Yes, yes, I know that to beggars belief. But there you go. I can only speak as I find. It occurs to me that if in spite of all you're unable to come up with a 50 as anecdote for your cream cracker tally, you could renegotiate the deal with your publisher and instead give them 50 anecdotes about water biscuits. I have all the material you will need. And instead of having to route around desperately trying to track down a 50 is diverting an entertaining and instructive cream cracker story, you would simply have to discard four of my water biscuit tails. Alternatively, I could do that for you sending you to Just the 50 you need each one guaranteed to be a full and true account of an occasion on which for a variety of reasons, I underwent a spell of derangement due to a water biscuit, or in some cases, water biscuits, plural. That is the kind of stuff which I think would make any publisher happy, or at least any publisher worth his salt. I'm not going to digress upon the salt content or lack of it in cream crackers and or water biscuits as that way madness, madness lies, or if not madness, then at the very least, on hinge moment, or derangement, as I know to my cost. So poppin is bit poppin is bit, let me know by return of post which road you wish to go down the avenue to cream crackers or the bulevar do water biscuits. I will then send you a very lengthy screed which you may fill it or print as you so wish. And that is the end of this week's hooting yard on the air. Depressed horses and cream crackers basically, plus a much much valued intervention from Norman Davis. If Norman Davis is possibly listening to this show, please get in touch. Your book is a great, great thing. Speaking of books, there is imminently a new hooting yard paperback. But I'll tell you more about that when it's available, which should be very soon. Other than that, that's the end of this week's show. Bye bye
