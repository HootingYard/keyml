Good evening and welcome to resonance 104 point four FM if you've just tuned in, or even if you're listening from before, or resonance fm.com if you're listening on your computer, my name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Now over the last week on the hooting yard website at hooting yd.org. I've been only I've been I've been posting things in alphabetical order, I decided to constrain myself to doing an A to Zed of 26 posts in alphabetical order. The reason the all the inspiration for this will become apparent when I read you a but what we're going to do this evening and probably next week is just go through the alphabet. So far, I'm up to the letter K. Anyway, we'll begin with a many moons ago, when the hooting yard website was but young, on the ninth of March 2004. To be precise, I noted the fact I had learned that Ambrose bierce, the author of the devil's dictionary, among many other things, had 12 siblings, all whose given names began like his with the letter A. In the brief postage where I mentioned this, I included a request for a knowledgeable reader to let me know what all those names were. Six and a half years have passed and you know, not a single person has bothered to respond. This is simply not good enough. I don't think it's too much to expect that my loyal and devoted readers and listeners should register such a request and beaver away, burning the candle at both ends, putting their own lives on hold if necessary, until they've discovered the information I'm seeking. Wait a moment while I admit a sigh, an expressive sigh which somehow commingles saintly patience and inordinate mental suffering and fathomless disappointment there. Now because of the distinct want of diligent research on the part of my readers and listeners, I've had to find out the names of Ambrose business siblings all by myself. You say What trouble you've caused me. Anyway? Let bygones be bygones? Let us move forward in a spirit of happy comedy striding purposefully towards the slightly overcast at Planned me a preening Magnifico and you lot stricken by Anna swipeable pangs of guilt. Oh, and before I forget, here are those names of the 13 children of Marcus are really his business and his wife Laura Sherwood best of horse Cave Creek means County, Ohio, from the oldest to the youngest. They were Abigail, Emilia, and Maria Addison or relias Augustus Almeida, Andrew, Albert, Ambrose, Arthur, and the twins, a Delia and Aurilia. Unusually for those days old but the youngest three survived to adulthood, which also begins with a

be this the bat and for our entry on bat, who better to quote than the preposterous ridiculous, Alistair Crowley Crowley didn't know which way to pronounce it. This is from the cry of the 18th ether, which is called Zen from his vision and the voice written in 1909, as far as I know, or care. And now they're adorns the scene of the crucifixion. But the crucified one is an enormous bat. And for the two thieves are two little children. It is night and the night is full of hideous things. And howlings. So scary isn't the Alistair Crowley. Anyway, our alphabet continues with C for cankerworm. Certainly perplexed was I that I was waking each morning and had been for months on end engulfed in a miasma of I'm not verbal spiritual desolation. I sought advice from a Quack I encountered on a bank outing. He was sitting in the seat next to mine all wrapped up in a visible aura of wisdom, a sort of pinkish violet haze. And his one good eye seemed to me to emit a ray, a ray that could pierce my spiritual innards where he back to train it upon me. I tapped him on the shoulder so he would turn to face me. You look like the kind of fellow who might be able to diagnose the miasma of spiritual desolation within which I tremble in golfed, I said, not beating about the bush. I am that man, he replied. And about 30 seconds later, he added, you have a cankerworm nestling within the very core of your soul, and it is gnawing away at your spiritual vitals. I knew I could rely on you, I said, possibly a bit too loudly. For elsewhere in the shower bank heads turned and cranes to look, I slipped some coinage into the cracks outstretched palm, settled back in my seat and shut my eyes. Soon enough, we reached the destination of our outing, a ruined fortification of great antiquity and crumbled and lashed by wind and rain. Tucking my wind treater close to about my puny frame, I fairly skipped out of the shower bank into the mud, animated by a sense that having discovered the cause of my honourable spiritual desolation, I could now do something about it. But what was I to do? The cankerworm with Nestle in my soul, and we still do not know where abouts within us the soul resides. Indeed, there is a growing body of opinion that we do not have souls at all, that the whole idea is a fantasy or a metaphor or just blithering nonsense. Well, I laugh in the face of those who deny their souls existence. I may not know precisely where mine is in brain or heart or spleen or kidney, but I know that it's about the size and shape and color of a plum tomato, I was told as much by amigas at a seaside resort Long, long ago. traipsing around the ruin and then on the sharer bank journey back, during which there was no sign of the crack his seat next to mine, having been taken by a television cat show host to whom I could not quite put a name and do not ask for he was frowning mightily on mentally chewed over what I might do about my cankerworm Was there some substance or formula I could ingest that would do me no harm, but would blast the little cankerworm to perdition. Some potion or preparation of milk of magnesia and aniseed and possible goal, organize an accident with a theory or pliers that might put me at risk of irreversible psychic injury of course. But was it a price worth paying? I juggled these and other thoughts, until my brain overheated, at which point I went to bed for it was by now light and dark. And when I woke up to go and spend, blocking and contents of a dream to define it in powerful preksha man language, it took me a few seconds to realize that I had not the magnetic charisma of Dr. King to be mad at me, it's thought that popped into my head was to wonder precisely when Dr. King became the preferred way of referring to the Reverend Martin Luther King.

And if this had happened at the same time, as it may became obligatory for all United States presidential candidates, Soto mentioned Dr. King, in at least one campaign speech to Garrett to garner guaranteed applause. seconds later, the next and most important thought occurred to me, for the first time in months, I had woken up without feeling engulfed in a miasma of verbal spiritual desolation. Quite the contrary, I was filled with them and gosh and pep that was ready for a large Aggie breakfast, and nothing was going to stop me. Talking into my eggs prepared in accordance with the blockman system, see the appendix to the third handbook in the lavender series. I tried to remember my dream as clearly it provided the clue to my newfound mental and spiritual well being. But I could remember nothing. So after a post breakfast hike along paths and lanes and canal towpath, and throw them in this apple Park, I took from it to cubby my hat sized metal cone plopped into top, my head aligned my head at the correct angle. See the instructions in botsman seventh Handbook, lilac series and stared into space, mouth hanging open, dribbling Gosh, it soon became apparent that in the midst of sleep, I had visualized my little canker worm, knowing its way through my plum tomato shaped soul, and instead of seeing it as an invader to be repulsed or expunged I had cosseted it as a pet. I named it Diego bird and furnished it with a Huck and pampered it and took it for walks in so far as a worm can walk attached to a lead. The lead was made of Ecto plasmic string from a spirit Viola. The question now was whether I was able to apply these methods to my real albeit invisible and intangible spiritual cankerworm. Perhaps if I kept the metal cone on my head beyond the recommended time limit, thus risking weird head gatherings, paralysis and death, I might be granted the powers to construct Daigo Burt's little hatch. After all, I reasoned her reason, if he was snug in his heart, he would desist from his knowing wouldn't take. I was certain though, I was certain, though On what grounds I knew not that my plum tomato soul could regenerate sufficiently to repair all the damage caused by the knowing. But where would I take my little cankerworm on it's unnecessary walks. Under the metal cone, my head grew hot and frazzled, and I fell into a swoon. The following week, I once again boarded the sharer bank for an outing, this time to a den of iniquity preserved in quicklime. I sat down next to a different quack, one whose visible aura was purple and golden, and whose spirit piercing Ray projected not from his eye, but from a star in the center of his forehead. Excuse me, I said, but you look like the kind of fellow who might be able to see into my soul and tell me if it's being nor that by a little cankerworm named dagobert. I am that man. He roared in reply, and aimed his rage at me. I waited for him to report his findings. As I waited, the driver lost control of the share bank, and we veered scre scroll off the road and plunged into a ditch. The ditch was riddled with puddles. And each puddle was rife with worms, and some of them were canker worms, and they were Legion and uncountable. But somehow, I could count them. And I did. And I learned that as we flailed, panting and stricken in the ditch, their number had increased by one little Daigo bird had gone to join his fellows in their cankers ditch puddle of doom, and I was free.

De in our alphabet is a date field diary, I'm pleased to announce that I'll be reading a couple of very short stories as part of a night of live radio art presented by the resonance radio orchestra at the jelly fish theater on Sunday, the third of October. Tickets are five pounds and doors open at 7pm. The jellyfish theater is a temporary structure built of pallets and discarded doors and old nails. look it up online either for either by putting in jellyfish theater into Google or you can find details on the hooting yard website on expect you can find them on the resonance website too. So that's Sunday, the third of October 7pm jellyfish theater and I think my my story will be accompanied by Music by lepc ebook quarter, so Isn't that fantastic? So that's Sunday after next. Meanwhile, we go on in our alphabet with E. Which in this case stands for embargo. I decided to place an embargo on the blog postage, it is or was going to be about the cargo of a barge. It was a large barge freighted with spectacularly interesting cargo, magnificent in both quantity and quality on an impossibly extensive canal system, beginning attack and terminating a bluff. But I've told you too much ready bearings Mind my embargo. The reason for the embargo could be termed quaint. I suppose we're one to be seeking a descriptive to describe the nature of the embargo is not necessarily to justify it. And I'm aware that some listeners may wish to have it so justified. oe, there'll be braying gobs widen knuckles dragging along the ground. What do you think you're up to mister putting an embargo on our hooting yard item? At least that's the kind of thing they might break if they could string a sentence together. Be assured I'm referring only to a tiny minority of my listeners. The ones who gather on Monday evenings in the shabby annex just down the lane from the eerie mysterious barlas screwin hoon, Puj farmyard there to squat on stalls in mysterious, eerie candlelight, and to read my prose aloud to each other. As it happens, the annex is on the banks of the canal. So the large barge with its tremendous cargo, either will pass by or has already done so, at the time of the gathering in the autumnal dusk. I can appreciate that they will fumin fret wondering What in the name of heaven I would have had to say about it, in fact, have said about it, or rather written about it, but then quaintly embargoed, but I'm not about to reverse my quaint decision to do so would catapult me into Muddy Waters from which I might not emerge. Even if I did emerge, I would be stained with mud, perhaps forever. You could go to the longer read. By Monday, dusk readers might shout voices raid raised in a collective whinge. But ah, launderette begins with L. And we have six letters to post before we get that far. I'm taking this alphabet seriously.

pay fees for flares. That's right. flares are not just any old flares, but solar flares up in the heavens immense and dazzling solar flares due to create a space storm that could incapacitate the infrastructure of civilization on Earth. Or, as the Sun newspaper put it, excitingly could turn the sky red wipe internet and paralyze Earth. These world shattering solar flares were an item on Channel Four news one night this week, in spite of the fact that these huge explosions of energy from the sun which could crash electricity grids and paralyze the earth due to occur in just three years time. The story was not the main headline, nor even the second or third headline. In fact, it came at the tail end of the bullet in the place one might expect to be told about a skateboarding duck or a pancake bearing the face of Christ. has it come to this? The destruction of civilization as we know it is considered to be of a lesser account the Nick Clegg. Yes, yes, we know that Clegg smokes, and idolizes Samuel Beckett and weeps when he listens to the four last songs by Richard Strauss. But remember to that Chris Mullin, a man of I think some integrity, who still watching television in black and white describes Clegg as easily the biggest charlatan of the lot. The terrifying thing is that if two thirds of the skies will indeed be smothered in a blood red Aurora, what will become of hooting? Yod? Let's get our priorities right. The Lib Dem party conference may be of interest to smoking bocchetti and Strauss's charlatans and their hangers on but any sane person would be preparing themselves for a hideous new dispensation of pre industrial scavenging untold savagery and silence. Why can't a death itself falling upon Dobson and Blodgett and tiny Enid and pebble head and all your hooting yard favorites? Surely, even Krishnan, Guru Murthy can grasp the horrifying implications. There is a crumb of comfort, I suppose, in the likelihood that we'll be we'll reach the end of our alphabetic shedule long before 2013

G is for Mrs gubbins obviously, Bathsheba gubbins, you have been found guilty of a raggle taggle salmagundi of crimes, some so heinous, that they beggar belief and make strong men break down into convulsive weeping. Now, by dint of the awful and arbitrary power invested in me, do not ask when or by whom I pronounce sentence. Message gubbins, you shall be taken from this place by horse and cart during a rainstorm, and deposited none too kindly in a chamber within the sort of institution appropriate to a Crone of your advancing years. And there you will remain and there you will knit. You will knit and knit and knit forever more without cease. When cities burn and the planet crumbles and the sun is extinguished. Still, you shall knit Bathsheba gubbins, you shall knit tea cozies and scarves and miscellaneous Woolies, and at the very instant they are completed, they shall unravel and you will net them again from scratch. from dawn until dusk and through the cold, dark horrors of the night. You shall nit much like Sisyphus, hopelessly pushing his boulder uphill as he gaped to watch it roll down to the bottom of that hill again and again. So shall you see your knitting unravel? Until all you have to show for your toil is a tangled skein of wall water you must knit again and again and again into a tea cozy or a scarf or a woolly? The only sound in your chamber. She'll be the interminable clack clack of your knitting needles. Knit lad gubbins knit. From now until the end of time, and beyond. clack clack, clack. Take her down. Crikey, what a revelation. Until now it's been beyond the most acute of which to grasp Why on earth the criminally minded octogenarian Crone never ever ceases to knit veteran of innumerable armed robberies and mystic badger abductions, like gubbins sets clacking away, occasionally dribbling staring into the middle distance, seemingly happy in her toil. Only the chance discovery of this dicta belt recording in a cardboard box underneath a sink in an outhouse in the grounds of a mysterious country pile, situated behind enormous wrought iron gates, partly hidden at a bend in a bosky Lane lined by Titanic cedars and larches, along which brightly colored sports cars driven at reckless speed by raffish chaps wearing cravats and goggles zoom past has revealed the truth of the matter. The matter being that that endless knitting, which at last we can understand as Sisyphean. Where and when the dicta belt recording was made is unclear. It's fanciful to suggest as van spurt Bosch does in his recently published monograph that it came from the same cache that yielded the dicta belt recording from the police motorcycle of officer HP McLean, whose radio microphone was accidentally stuck in the open position as he accompany the presidential motorcade along Dealey Plaza in Dallas on the 22nd of November 1963. And that's picked up sounds and so called impulse patterns, which would have become germane to the inquiry regarding the identity of the assassin or Assassins of president john Fitzgerald Kennedy on that day, and in that place. waters were muddied in that waters were muddied in that case, by officer MacLean latest suggesting his dicta belt was not the source of the recordings, but rather that of one of his colleagues. Equally fanciful is van spurred by his wild claim that john McClane, the character played by Bruce Willis and the diehard tetralogy was based on the Dallas police motorcyclist. One need only compare the spellings of the names to see it ain't so had Vance Burt Bosh done his homework, much grief Much much grief. Indeed, as much grief as there is in gubbins in knitting could have been spared. grief, like gubbins begins with G. So in this installment of our alphabetic posted shedule, you've had double helpings. Remember that next time you're minded to bemoan your lot.

To win this week show, I'm going to read you half a quotation. This is the quotation for the letter H. H is for hybrid. But there's only time for half the quotation. So we'll have the second half next week. It's from an essay called the mind snatchers by Frederick Cruz, and it's published in his collection of essays follies of the wise. He is for hybrid. Many people think that the aliens having subjected abductees to breeding experiments in parked spaceships or secret underground laboratories have already produced a race of hybrids who will someday rule or even replaces. The hybrids may in fact be shopping and commuting all around us as I write. And even if they aren't there, mixed parentage could help to explain the familiar images found in abduction memories like the following and their follow for quotes from alien abduction people. He's got on a multi striped t shirt and some like little blue shorts. They had sophisticated looking toys. They have a yo yo. It looks like an extra sketch screen except it filled with all sorts of stuff. They were dressed like 1920s thugs and came into the bedroom with old fashioned Tommy guns aiming at me and blazing away. Beth Collins saw a naked man in an enormous white cowboy hat. Carla Turner mentioned to people she knows who've seen aliens disguised as hillbillies. And Katharina Wilson had an experience with an alien masquerading as our Gore. With that terrifying thought, I'll leave you to this week. So we've got from A to halfway through Ah, and we'll continue from the second half of age two. Who knows where next week. Thank you for listening. Hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
