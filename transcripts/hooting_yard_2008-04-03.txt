Good evening This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frankie. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour. And one of the things that I've been giving some thought to is gathering together collecting together all the various papers relating to Dobson the out of print pamphleteer trying to sort them into some kind of chronological order for for biography, but the problem is, every time I kind of think about doing that new material comes in. new material comes in, and for example, this one wintertime in a period when he was watching far too many action films, Dobson decided that he wanted to have his own SWAT team to deploy as the fancy took him. marigold Tru pointed out to the pamphleteer that this latest notion of his was particularly demented. She asked him where he expected to bill it, his team, how he proposed to pay them in what delusional circumstances he might order them out on a mission and crucially, what resources he had to ensure that they were given a thorough debriefing with access if necessary, to post traumatic stress disorder counseling. Dobson replied with a series of low grunting noises, before clambering into his new oversized Uruguayan fair trade Cagoule and crashing out into the downpour. The goal was secondhand stained and rent in many places, but it was new to Dobson and he thought he'd cut a dash in it, though of course, he did not for Dobson rarely, if ever cut a dash and then only by accident. As he trudged along the canal towpath into town. Dobson composed in his fuming brain, the advertisement he plans to place in these situations vacant column of the evening sofa and last trump. It truly appeared remarkably free of misprint. A few hours later. Wanted SWAT team to carry out engagements on behalf of out of print pamphlet here. Some of the missions may be perilous. Applicants should be armed to the teeth, and preferably dressed from head to foot in black with big black boots and shiny black helmets with visors. You will be able to give a full account of the vitality of your numa in the ancient Greek sense of the fiery essence in the air, that creative and animating spirit drawn into the body through the lungs and generating your innate heat. Benefits include free pamphlets and lots of smoking breaks. It did not escape marigold chews notice that the advertisement failed to address any of the questions she had raised with Dobson earlier that evening, on the way to a peasant theatre adaptation of airport Caplin, she tried a different tack. Assuming for a moment that a sufficient tally of persons with vibrant numer apply to be on your SWAT team Dobson. She said, what sort of missions Do you intend to send them on? SWAT team missions, replied Dobson excitedly, as their tram plowed through a puddle of ice missions that will test their valor and grit as well as their pneuma.

Press to supply just one tiny example before they arrived at the dilapidated barn that had been converted by goateed Trust Fund gets into a performance space. Dobson suggested that he would deploy his SWAT team in the event of a calamitous tram collision, resulting in dozens of dead and injured tram passengers. marigold Chu pointed out that as there was but a single tram that plied the tram tracks of the town, no such collision could take place. Dobson countered that the tram might collide with a bus. marigold Chu pointed out that the timetables and routes of the tram and the bus had been designed with just such a calamity in mind. And so clever had the planning been that a collision of bus and tram was both theoretically and physically impossible. Dobson thought she said implausible and clutched at that straw for a few seconds until erected. He then aired the idea that the tram might collide with wild roaming cows. marigold Chu was forced to admit that wild roaming cows did sometimes roam wildly through the town and could conceivably roam wildly into the path of the oncoming tram. Dobson looked smug. marigold Chu then landed the killer punch by asking Dobson pointedly what his numr inspired SWAT team would do if sent to intervene in a scene of smashed up tram and the tangled and bloody bodies of tram passengers and wild roaming cows dead dying, wounded, scarred, fractured and hysterical. Dobson had not thought beyond the excitement of his SWAT team descending on cables from their whirring helicopter and had no ready reply. But at the very moment that he was going to improvise some unconvincing Flim Flam, the tram Clank to a halt next to the dilapidated bomb, and the converse conversation was forgotten, as both Dobson and marigold true alighted in the snow and rummaged in their Pipi bags for their airport Caplin tickets. Remarkably, in the ensuing weeks, Dobson received several applications from SWAT team wannabes. It is to his credit that he granted each one a lengthy interview less so that irrespective of what they said he rejected them all on the grounds that their numa was deficient. One hopeful felt crushed by Dobson's decision called on him armed with documentary evidence of absolutely fantastic numer and became belligerent marigold to set the crows on him and he fled. following spring, he and Dobson passed each other in the street. They spat at each other.

This next piece doesn't involve Dobson, so it's not one of the things that I would have to try and work into the biography. Reports reached me of dismal doings at the pointy town Tourist Board. In an attempt to drum up visitor numbers, a faction on the board is engaged in not just the rewriting of history, but its wholesale invention. The latest brochure invites me and thousands like me to take part in the so called pointy town pilgrimage trail, experiencing quote, the sights and sounds and tastes and smells that greeted those ancient wayfarers who embarked upon the pilgrimage to pointy town in days of yore. Unquote. This is shameless twaddle. In the ancient days, to which the brochure refers pointed town itself did not exist. All a wayfarer of your would have found was an area of curiously pointy ground with a few ponds on which ancient ducks and swans clamored. It's true that the pointedness of the land led later to the erection of a town. But in ancient days, there were not even any wattle and daub dwellings there. And the area has no caves to speak of, in which ancestral pointed towners could have sheltered from the filthy weather. The Tourist Board wants us to believe if I'm interpreting the illustrations correctly, that thousands of years ago, saucy pilgrims' with terrific hairstyles, fetched up in pointy town, from all over the land, and even from lands beyond and celebrated the General pointedness of things by holding strange ancient ceremonies, traces of which can be found today. For example, there is a gaping pit around the corner from the present post office. And this is meant to be evidence not of botched contemporary roadworks but a REIT involving herons and Vipers and bees and hairy men, where all these herons and Vipers and bees and hairy men are meant to have come from and how they gathered around the pit and what they did once they're gathered, is all left a bit vague, as To be frank is the claim that the post office itself stands on the site of the pointy town thing and ancient parliament on the Icelandic model and predating the Icelanders own thing by a good few centuries. I'm assure that next time I lick the reverse of a postage stamp at the post office counter. I will be doing so at the very spot where an ancient pointy Towner named AXA, correct agrax, proclaimed the trimmings, whatever they're meant to be. This same anax correct. agrax is supposedly related how we're not told to a tasa the imperious Mother of Xerxes, which gets the Tourist Board into all sorts of chronological and geographical not. Indeed, there are so many knots vagaries and plain implausibilities in this invented history that Only a fool would be taken in. That being so it has to be said that there are plenty of foolish people around for the pointy town pilgrimage trail is proving to be a thunderous success. Last week, I decided to hide over there for the first time in the years to see what was going on. I didn't bother taking the brochure with me, for I had dropped it into a puzzle and it was not yet dry. I wore galoshes and the hat of a peasant for my trip, and rather overdid breakfast in the dining carriage of the pneumatic railway train, which we used with many spluttering halt through the horrible countryside towards pointy town, the pointy bits of which were visible long before we finally hissed into the station. Having memorized the tourist brochure as best I could, I was aware that the station was part of the pilgrimage trail. It was here apparently, that the counting of birds took place. The tally posted on a flag hoisted high. What numeric system was used, what material a flag was woven from and with what instrument the flag was marked. None of this was made clear. Those ancient folk may have had a sort of hemp, but we know for a fact that they had no ink. And in any case, how did they get all the birds to stand still and be counted. I was already thoroughly exasperated as I made my way to the station canteen for one last plate of sausages and treacle and a bowl of cornflakes and a beaker of tea. Imagine my disgust when I saw that the beaker was stamped with a pilgrimage emblem. And an accompanying leaflet informed me that it was a reproduction of the beakers used by pointy town pilgrims at celebrated feast on the eve of the docking hack.

my temper did not improve as I lumbered slowly into town. There seemed to be not a single street building lamppost or duck pond that had not been hijacked by the Tourist Board for it, counterfeit history. Even when I popped into a snack bar for elevenses, I could not escape. Sitting down to our hearty pan of pig haunches and Sue it. I was joined immediately by a local person sporting the hat of an indigent, who barely took time to introduce himself, before regaling me with his theory that the ancient pointy town pilgrims were not freeborn men and women, but abductees yoked together like farmyard creatures, driven to the town by brutish captors for purposes we modern sophisticates could only guess that he had drawings of course, which he took from an inner pocket of indescribable grumpiness and spread out on the snack bar table, almost knocking over my tumbler of fermenting berry slops as he did so. He talked me through each drawing with some excitement, explaining that the sketches had come to him in fits of in trance to lucidity. I was not surprised to see spaceships patrolling the sky and about half of the scribbles. But Curiously, he made no reference to them in his babble. He was insistent that I go along with him to see one of the most pointy bits of pointy town, where he promised he would show me incontrovertibly evidence of his abduction theory in the form of fragments of yoke and chain embedded in ancient shards of bitumen, but I was having none of it. When I had finished my snack, I knocked his hat off his head and swept his drawings off the table, stamping them into the floor as I left. Back on the street, I checked my bearings by the area late morning light and heavy towards the town center, where I wanted to visit the Tourist Board office. No one seemed willing to call into question, the falsification of pointy town history. emboldened by my breakfasts and elevenses are determined to give the liars a peace of mind mind. It was unlikely that single handed I could dismantle the rash of a historical poop engulfing what had been my My favorite town, but at least my spleen would be vented as spleens require venting, preferably after a good lunch. As I promised alongside the graveyard wall, I reflected on the disservice these bumptious numbskulls were doing to the true heroes have pointy town past. Men like fairing push gas, the legendary Hungarian football ice, who, though he had no connection with the place whatsoever, and indeed, had never even heard of pointy town, let alone ever visited it in life, was nonetheless a numinous presence in every Park and garden and patch of mud, at least as far as I was concerned. It mattered not to me that the pointy towners themselves were blind to his authorial dash and Verve. Push gas for me, was as much a presiding spirit of pointy town, as was the medieval chieftain, Bruno lapu. Bell, who laid out the winding pathways of the old town, planted the grassy knoll, built the pergola and the school Book Depository and made some of the pointy bits even point here than nature intended. But where was lapu bell to be found in this new dispensation? It looked to me as if the Tourist Board had a raised him and it was with a sick heart and a sick brain that I crashed into the cafe spigot next door to the Tourist Board office to have my lunch. Tucking into a gigantic helping of jugged, hare lobster and bran flakes. I rehearsed the uninvited lecture I planned to give to the wretched of the ghettos of the pilgrimage trail. I was assuming that they would all be there next door skulking about inventing fresh idiocies, counting the cash they had fleeced from the ignorant. Only during the trees, sponge and nuts course, did it occur to me that today was a public holiday, and the office was likely to be shot. Yet by now, I felt impelled to make the lying gets feel the lash of my tongue. I would uphold the glory of the ghost of push gas and lap bluebell and dash their pasteboard chaff aside, or squash it underfoot, or crumble it in the palm of my hand, or whatever one does with caffeine, pointy town. As I took dainty sips from my postprandial cup of soup, I remembered that pebble head had written the best selling paperback called a basic

Frank Key  17:35
survey of methods of pasteboard chaff disposal in pointy town, and resolve to break and enter the library to consult a copy. Armed with pebble heads techniques, perhaps I could destroy the heritage Horace disfiguring the town, and then wrap it once again in the protective blankets of lapu. Bell and push gas. The library was out beyond the seven tiny warehouses and the fairground, which meant that I had to negotiate my way past the dole hospital, the most frightening place in pointy town. Ever since I had first visited it decades ago, as an ambitious cub reporter sniffing out a story of gruesomeness treachery and dole related fruitfulness is it been the locus of my nightmares? I never did write up the story and resigned from the pointy town Herald and thunderclaps soon afterwards, fast began my long exile from the town of my birth, my estrangement from all I held dear. The intervening decades have been hard on me. But as I swept along mid your Boulevard, I realized that time has been harder on the town itself. All I had cherished seemed to be either vanished or in decay, and even the pointy bits on the approach to the warehouses seemed blunter and less pointy. Was the Tourist Board solely responsible for the ruin? Or were there other wider, more sinister forces at work? I pulled my wind treater tighter around my torso, and popped into a roadside Tea Room for a mug of tea and a jumbo packet of arrowroot biscuits. The tea room I learned was annexed to the pointy town badger sanctuary, and impose a surcharge on each biscuit sold to fund it badger work. admirable as this initiative was it made for a tremendously expensive stack, and I began to worry that I would not have cash enough in my Pipi bag to afford supper before catching the train home. I also needed to drop into an ironmongery to buy or rent the tools necessary to affect my breaking into the library. I was counting out my remaining coins on the tea rooms for micro tabletop when I mustachioed old timers sidled over to me He wore the hat of an ingrate, and gave a distinct aura of bitter Gall. I was in no mood for another snack bar conversation with a conspiracy theorist. So without a word, I turfed the oldsters hat from his head, scooped my coinage back into my Pipi bag, and made for the door. I was halfway towards the ironmongery merchant, when I realized that the elderly in great now hatless was following me, but making no attempt to catch me up. I stopped and he stopped to. I took one pace forward, and he took to this was because I have a long loping stride, whereas my pursuer took more cautious, rickety steps. In fact, I was surprised he did not topple over. Using binoculars, I scanned his face to which I had paid little attention in the tea room. So bushy and magnificent was his moustache, that it was difficult to see beyond it, but it struck me that there was something familiar about him. He tugged at a corner of my memory, but I could not yet place him. tacking the binoculars back into their pouch. I walked on, occasionally checking to see if still he trailed me. And he did. The afternoon sun blazed high in the sky as I reached the spot near the municipal flowerbeds where I expected to find the ironmongery many many years had passed since last I was in pointy town, but I hardly expected to find this landmark Emporium gone. It was, after all, the most inspiring ironmongery in the whole province, a magnet for bolt cutting enthusiasts near and far. Yet no trace of it survived in its place. So the plinth, a top which was a hideous cement statue of a saucy pilgrim with a terrific hairstyle, holding a cement placard announcing that this was the end of the pointy town pilgrimage trail. It was ugly, it was spurious, and a magnificent ironmongery shop had been bulldozed by the Philistines on the Tourist Board to make way for it. I was livid. I was also dashed in my plan to buy or rent tools with which to Jimmy the lock on the library door. What now? I leaned against the railing surrounding the plinth and took from my pocket or

bag of brisket and toffee. munching on these would steady my nerves and allow me time to think just as I bit off a mouthful of brisket, I was overcome by an or a bit of a goal. And the engrade, who had been tailing me suddenly materialized at my side, in a manner I was unable to comprehend and cannot describe. He simply stood there lagu breus and mournful with flies circling his hatless head, he was close enough that I had no need of binoculars to examine his face, and I forced my eyes to appear behind the mustache, trying to recall where I had seen him before.

I grew up in pointy town and had an idyllic childhood. I remember tents and swans and dramatic hiking incidents. I remember flag days and sing songs and buying my first child sized bolt cutters and other ironmongery items. I remember toads and pastries and gutta percha. I remember hearing the nine fairing push gas on the radio, and the sound of thousands cheering. And I remember lolloping home from the library cluttering my favorite book, I lavishly Illustrated History of pointy town for pointy town tinies. And I remember the frontispiece of the book, a mezzotint by the mezzotint is direct 10th of the medieval pointy town chieftain, Bruno lapu. Bell with his fantastically bushy mustache. He it was all his race, who stood beside me now. No wonder he was engulfed in an aura of bitter Gore, witnessing the desecration of the town he raised from a patch of pointy ground. I gaped at him, pop hide, nearly choking on my brisket. Then the sky so summer, Sunny a moment ago, was plunged into an uncanny blackness. And I felt lapu Belle's hands upon my shoulders, shriveled yet firm, and I felt the rustle of his mighty moustache upon my forehead. And then I too, was enveloped in his aura of bitter gold. But I felt most intensely and ennoblement of my spirit, and I startled recognition with that with the potency of my brain alone, I could smash to smithereens every year. vile Tourist Board pilgrimage trail Bubo throbbing with venom in the pointy town I loved I could obliterate them in an instant if I wished. The blackness evaporated. The sun blazed again, as it always did on this blesseds town, and I dipped my hand into my bag of brisket and toffee, ready to offer a bite to Bruno lapu Bell, but the apparition had vanished. I was alone by the railings beneath the cement statue of the spurious saucy pilgrim with the terrific hairstyle. I had the power to dash it to dust. How would I choose? I've retraced my steps to the town center, beaming as I passed the ducks and swans clamoring on the pond, and tipping my peasants hat to the demonstrators from gorgeous George Galloway is respect party who were marching against something or other or in favor of something else. A Beatle brown university lecturer dodged out of the demo and pressed a shoddy newspaper upon me, so I tested out my new powers by swatting him aside merely by raising an eyebrow. I was pleased to note that as he hurtled over the horizon at inhuman speed, his pile of newspapers burst into flames. I went back to the cafe spigot and ordered a dish of bloaters and spam and goose grease and fudge sundae. And as I sat waiting, I decided that I would let the evening crane leave without me. I have come back to pointy town, and now I had work to do.

And that's all we have time for from hooting out this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. I just like to leave you with a quotation. This is from Tom Holland book Persian fire, the First World Empire and the battle for the West about what about the wars between Persia and Greece and Sparta and all that two and a half thousand years ago, but he wrote, and I think this is very important deprive the great king of his pudding and morale might start to plummet. Not that it was an easy matter to catch out a bureaucracy so attentive to detail that it was in the habit of issuing travel trips to ducks. And with that, bye bye
