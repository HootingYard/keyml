is that microphone in the right kind of area. Okay. This is the live resonance FM experience and this is hooting out on the air. Coming to you live from Bara High Street. London SC one on first day the 24th of January 2019. Who would have thought it a? Yes. So as usual, I'm going to read to you for about 28 and a half minutes. Also reading to you today will be pansy cradle jus who's here again, currently knitting while she's not required to read what are you knitting, pansy?

Unknown Speaker  01:43
It's a sock.

Frank Key  01:45
pansy is knitting a sock. It's a radio sock or a resonance sock. Possibly a wind sock. Anyway, that being knitted while you listen to how exciting is that? I'll try and bring you a progress report on the knitting. As we go on. Let's elevate the tone somewhat Shall we? As a loose end, I signed up for Pilbeam crash course in the imitation of Christ. Earlier in the day, plodding through the streets, I've been given a leaflet. The Hawker who handed it to me was a person of regrettable grumpiness, and while and some of his filth, inevitably besmirched the leaflet, which was smudged with the effect that I misread the imitation of Christ as the imitation of Chris. Chris, who I wondered, hoping that Pilbeam was taking an overfamiliar tone with regard to the act of Christopher Plummer. It's so happened that I was wearing a Tyrolean jacket, not unlike the one sported by plumber in his career defining role as Captain von Trapp in the film version of the sound of music, dressed so I felt I would have an excellent chance of crashing through the crash course. And perhaps winning applauded or to last a folding raindrop washed away the smudge. And I realized the course was about Christ, rather than Christopher Plummer. Still, I was as I said, I don't loose end. So Excuse me. So I headed for a hole where the course was to be held, and I signed up. throng an hubbub packed the hole, but I found an empty seat and sat down. Soon enough, a fellow I assumed to be Pilbeam appeared on a dice at the front. The first thing he said was, I am not Pilbeam.

Frank Key  04:18
Have I been the Ord here under false pretenses. The speaker cut a tile and widdershins figure and there was almost a grime splatter. There's the Hawker in the street. It may even have been the same person, no doubt or rascal. But I had nothing better to do so I continue to sit and listen. I'm sorry to say that Pilbeam is not able to be with us today, said the man. He has been incapacitated by middle European pig flu. And there's asked me to deputize for him. Why am I would never Like so bold as to compare myself to Pilbeam, Please be assured that you are in good hands. I have spent many years studying under Pilbeam eating from the same table, having my hair cut the same barbers with wit. Having my hair cut at the same barbers with the same pair of scissors, and wearing the same size shoes, like Samuel Beckett and James Joyce, my name is Lars rather than Pilbeam. But I can say truthfully, that I'm the next best thing to Pilbeam when it comes to delivering this crash course. So let us turn now to the crash course itself, the aim of which is to furnish you with the skills necessary to imitate Christ. As it's a crash course, we will not be seeking to imitate Christ in every particular. If we tried that, He chuckled. We should become so Christ like there would be a risk of blasphemy. Far better according to Pilbeam, this precept, to imitate Christ in a limited way, enough for us to benefit and to become better than we are, but not so much that we threaten the unique and ineffable goodness of Christ our Lord Himself. I trust you're all keeping up. Excellent. In what way Then shall we imitate Christ, you will all I hope, be familiar with the story of the gatherings wine. It is to be found in all three of the side not particular gospels, in Matthew 828, to 32. In Mark five, one to 13, and in Luke 826 to 33. Briefly put, a poor man possessed by demons, begs Christ, to release him from his torment. Christ, Julie casts the demons out of the man and into some nearby pigs, which thereupon go rushing headlong into the sea and drown. certain details differ in the three accounts, but that's the general idea. Now, Pilbeam states that we can imitate Christ by driving a herd of pigs into the sea, or indeed into any large body of water. We need not worry our little heads about finding a man possessed by demons and all that hullabaloo. For our purposes, we take a crash course shortcut by imagining we have cast the demons out of the man and into the pigs. And we simply go the pigs into the water and make damn sure none of the manages to make it back to shore. The important thing in accurately imitating Christ is drowning the pigs. Any questions? I put up my hand. In your opening remarks, I've piped up when pointed at you. In your opening remarks, you I piped up, you said that Pilbeam could not be with us today, because he's suffering from middle European pig flu. Could it be that this whole Crash Course is his way of exacting vicarious revenge upon the flu ridden pigs he blamed for his condition? There were several guff from the audience at my audacity, last pause menacingly before responding. Seldom, he said, eventually, seldom have I heard so vile accountably Oh vile, vile, the calumny you have committed upon poor saintly bedridden middle European pig flu ridden Pilbeam. That paradigm among Crash Course tutors in the imitation of Christ. How dare you, sir? How dare you?

Frank Key  09:21
I'm sorry, I said. It was just a passing thought that was all laws seemed mollified, if only slightly. There is a fourth apocryphal version of the story of the gathering swine, he said, in Pilbeam 640 to 251. Here after driving the pigs into the sea, Christ has his henchmen sorry, apostles. Attack the man from whom demons have been cast out, beating him in sensible with spades and shovels before injecting his brain bruised and battered body with a virulent strain of middle European pig flu and then abandoning him on a remote at all far far out at sea. Usually, we do not attempt to enact the Pilbeam version on this crash course for one to volunteer, but on this occasion, we shall take great pleasure in doing so. And last clapped his hands and some of his apostles sorry henchmen, and they dragged me out of the hole and off towards the coastal pig farm, and the vast, wet, unforgiving sea.

Frank Key  11:16
For a long time I used to go to bed early. Often it was still bite as I shot my bedroom door and through the curtains and buried myself under my blanket. My homemade soundproofing, hundreds of caulk glued to the bedroom walls worked remarkably well. And I created the peace and quiet in the rest of the chalet the monkeys could do as they pleased. I was safe in my bed and undisturbed. Ever since I could remember I had wanted to live surrounded by monkeys. As a tiny taught, I made toy monkeys out of pipe cleaners and pin cushions. I begged my papaw to buy me a real monkey from a monkey shop, not knowing that there were no such shops in our Alpine fastness. As an evil nine year old, I planned to abduct a monkey or two from the zoo, but I was an inept little criminal, and one myself only a fortnight in a blanket camp for miscreant hobble the boys. During a fractious adolescence, I was diverted by brandy and floozies and high tar Peruvian cigarettes. And it was only when I gained my majority and was installed in my own chalet courtesy of a wealthy uncle that my monkey mania reasserted itself. Uncle Arpad was himself from the monkeys, though not as in my case, to the point of unreason. He had made his fortune in the windmill and plankton trades and had retired to rush Shall I just up the mountain from the one he bought for me? Every day I took the funicular railway up to visit him for breakfast, and over a dish of brisket and drug Partridge. He tells stories of his past and of other people's past and they've invented past and he invariably ended the sometimes tedious monologues by encouraged me encouraging me to live my dreams. He was, I think, a bitter man who regretted that he had

Frank Key  13:42
excuse me, he was I think, a bitter man who regretted that he had devoted his life to windmills and plankton, and he wanted better for me. descending the mountain after breakfast each day, tramping slowly in my snowshoes, I had time to ponder what I really wanted in life. And I knew in the very depths of my soul, that my greatest desire was to live surrounded by monkeys. Sometimes I carried on down the mountain past my own chalet, until I reached a village in the foothills, where I called into the blue bat Tavern for a tract with popsy von straubing. z popsy was one of the floozies I had to dallied with in my teenage years, and now he was older and wiser, and ran a stamp collecting club in one of the mountains many sanatoria where weaklings lay slowly perishing on balconies. These days my tipple was air rated lettuce water but popsie could still not back the brandy like a rough tough metal bowl. And she did so day in day out seemingly with no ill effect. It was to pop see that I can find it My dreams and desires, and it was popsie who helped them to come true. She too, had a wealthy uncle, also called Arpad and he was a monkey Hunter. All I had to do to be explained, was to tell her how many monkeys I wanted of what types and she would arrange for uncle Arpad to hunt them down, stun them with darts, put them into comas and into crate and have them delivered to my door and it would not cost me a penny she added, because uncle Arpad like nothing better than monkey hunting. he hunted monkeys with childish Glee, and he was both generous and unhinged. So I drew up a list and gave it to popsy and one bright March morning, the skiing post office person backed his tippy stick on my shadow a door, and I opened it to find several crates containing sleeping monkeys addressed to me. Pop sees uncle Arpad was as good as his word. I had grown used to living alone, the silence broken only by an occasional yodeling wayfarer, or an avalanche. And so for some weeks, things continued for each of my monkeys had been placed into an induced coma from a long journey from their jungle domains, and I have absolutely no idea how to snap them out of it. On one of my post breakfast trips to the blue bat, I asked popsy to find out from her uncle how to awaken my monkeys. But she told me with tears in her eyes, that our pad had been blown to bits in the Hindenburg airship disaster. I went up to the counter to buy her another brandy to comfort her. And while I waited to be served, I browse through a copy of the reader's digest that someone discarded. How fortunate that I had that I did so for there in between articles such as I am John's ear, and 40 years of hell in a bauxite mine was a piece entitled, six easy steps to awaken a monkey from a medically induced coma. I tore the pages out of the magazine got popsy her Brandi kissed her goodbye, and too impatient to wait for the funicular railway clambered panting up the mountainside to my chalet, and to my sleeping monkeys. There were six simple steps, and I had six monkeys, even before the crates were delivered. I had chosen names for them. My other great enthusiasm, apart from monkeys was the merovingian kings. So the squirrel monkey was called Clovis. The two howler monkeys were dango Bert and Khloe tear. The owl monkey was kept in the middle. The Capuchin was theodoric and the spider monkey was good.

Frank Key  18:16
I followed the instructions in the Reader's Digest with the utmost diligence. disinfecting my pliers ringing out the roof, rinsing out the retort with boiling hot soapy water and even donning a white lab coat to give myself an air of boffin hood. In truth, I did not actually have a lab coat, so I stitched together a couple of proxies capes that I found in my wardrobe and stick them in bleach. One by one, my monkeys woke from their slumbers and began to caper about the chalet. They were excessively rowdy, quite uncontrollable and fantastically destructive. Shortly afterwards, I glued hundreds of corks to my bedroom wall and began to go to bed early. My monkeys have never stopped their antics. I love them. So

Unknown Speaker  19:35
another chance to delve into some real lives now with a few of the entries in Mr. Key shorter, potted brief brief lives. Mater's Molina, Swiss Polish English Irish artist and occultist 1865 to 1928 may there's the sister philosopher Henri Bergson, was accused 18 months after her death of killing Miss netta for Norio by black magic. It was said that Molina's Spirit had appeared in the form of a monster cat, and attacked the unfortunate netta. However, the scratches on the corpse were more likely the result of running naked in the dark over Rough Country, which Miss for Norio had been doing immediately before her collapse. McCartney, Paul, English Beatle born 1942 in 1964, McCartney and his fellow Beatles were banned from performing in Israel. An official government investigation into the mop tops had discovered compelling evidence that there yeah Yeah, yeah house are capable of striking dead a real beetle.

Frank Key  21:17
It was suggested to me by a suburban shaman that I should display upon my person as part of my rig. The plumage of who pose this this had not previously occurred to me was no doubt due to a distinct lack of shamanic advice in my life. Up to that point, I would go so far as to say that I had actively poo pooed manifestations of the mystic, whether in the form of shaman, wizards, magicians, or the blind sear whose tent was erected by the side of a mountain path, which passed by my chalet. It was through this sere that I was put in touch with a fellow who kept a flock of who pose in an iron cage, and they let me pluck their feathers in return for a small consideration. Once I had the sack of feathers safely home, I took great pains attaching them to my cardigan. I used cow gammon safety pins, and by the time I was done, scarcely a glimpse of war was visible. Beneath the hupo pluming. I donned the cardigan, and I waited enlightenment. The shaman had not been specific with regard to the esoteric hullabaloo I would experience so I did not know what to expect. I stood in my kitchenette and boil the kettle and made a cup of tea, all the while concentrating my mental energies upon my perceptible changes of insight into the spiritual realms. The realms were, of course, the ones of which until now I have doubted the very existence. I sat on my stool to drink my cup of tea, it tasted the same as usual. Just as the feel of the store was no different to any of the other thousands of times I've sat upon it in the past, I began to think that the suburban shaman had taken me for a fool. Then, having drained my cup then, having drained my cup, I went out along the mountain path and down into the village. It was the day of the goose market, which draws crowds from the hinterland. Now I began to understand the significance of the hupo feathered cardigan, for all eyes were upon me wide and bright, staring and surprise. A slight yet persistent mountain breeze ruffled the plumage, so that as one witness was later to put it, my torso appeared to be mystically vibrating, while my head and limbs remains still. And sterile I was four I took up a position in the village square between the goose pens and the cement statue of Ringo Starr and I stood there for hours for days, so that the villagers and the visitors from outlying parts were transfixed by my presence, their eyes gaping, their mouths hanging open, their goose business forgotten.

Frank Key  24:53
You would do well to remember if ever you go out walking in the vicinity of the farmyard at screwed hunahpu that you've made come face to face with the fainting goat. If you encounter it on the buying leading out of the farmyard towards the orchard, and as soon as it sees you it topples over in a swoon, you must not be alarmed, you must certainly not think that the goat has fainted because you have caused it fright by dint of something alarming in your appearance. Even if there is something terrifying about you, such as a twisted up face or two brightly colored, printed jacket, or you're being armed with a mailorder mandalika car car, no sniper rifle. None of these things will be what causes the goat to faint. The goat will fight for the reason this is known as the fainting goat, which is that is constantly fainting dozens of times a day, even dozens of times an hour. This constant swooning is a mystery as far as the local vets are concerned, there are several vets with practices in walking or short bus journey distance of screwin who pood farm yard and all of them at one time or another have been called to tend to the fainting goat. They tried all sorts of treatments from goat friendly smelling salt to the deployment of Peruvian whistling vessels, so simply shouting very loudly into the goats ear, and those such techniques may revive the goat from it to faint. None of serve to stop it clattering over in a dead swoon again and again. As the long countryside day draws on towards dusk and rainfall. Whether it is conscious, the goat seems hale and hearty, even frisky and engages in all the normal activities one might expect of a farmyard goat. I would list these activities, but I'm sure you're fairly up to speed with the doings of goats, given the demographic of the hooting yard listenership. There's been a certain amount of bickering among the local vets, as each of them grows frustrated that their inability to stop the continual fainting of the fainting goat. When they passed out of their veterinary colleges, they were all brimming with confidence, as they thought with the knowledge and expertise to handle all sorts of bestie or maladies from the worker day to the exotic, whether it was whether it be a cow with a pox or an ostrich beset by once three albums, each gruesomeness. These vets believed they could march into a farm yard, or Menagerie. And we'd be out when the undying gratitude of farmers and menagerist by weaving their vetti spells. an injection here a siphoning off of fluid there, and to the gasps of their keepers, the cow or ostrich or whatever beset beast, it may be would leap up, restored the vigor and there would be a round of applause and the discreet passing of banknotes into the pocket of the smug vet. I'm not sure there's time for me to finish reading this story about the finding goat. So I think I'll, I'll end it there. And maybe if I remember, I'll read you the rest of it next week. It's not really a story. So it doesn't matter. You know, it could end there. It could end after the next paragraph. It could never end at all. Or it could never even begin. I don't know. It's just more blather. But I hope you've enjoyed the blather. And I think that's the end of this week's show. Although I'm not entirely clear because I can't see the clock.
