This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. The episode if you're listening live for first day the 16th of October 2014. And if you're listening to a repeat or listening to an online, archived version or podcast, it's not the 16th of October might be, I suppose. Yes, yes, he might be listening to it later in the evening. You might even be listening to the podcast on the 16th of October 2015. Who knows? Anyway, I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm gonna know what I'm talking what I talked about for the next 27 or eight minutes. Where are the snows of yesteryear? They have been shoveled into a refrigerated container and ferried to a remote storage facility also refrigerated where they're kept in specially designed snow bins. How can I gain access to the storage facility? with difficulty? As stated, it is remote assuming for the moment that I have at my disposal a tremendous form of transport that could zoom me to the remotest parts of the earth in a matter of a minute. in which direction Should I pointed before depressing the big knob with goal act upon it. You don't actually have such a form of transport, do you? Well, no, but let's just say that I did. Your direction of travel would depend upon where you are starting from. I am in pointy town. There is plenty of snow in pointy town. Each winter it settles on the pointy bits of town and remains there cold and white and frozen until the chirping of little birdies in the springtime. Why in heaven's name would you need access to the snow bins in the remote storage facility? When when? If when is not a good enough reason. Then let us say I have been appointed by the burghers of pointy town to compare our own snow with the snows of yesteryear and to make my report accordingly. These burgers are they in their right mind. That is a moot point. I know one of them suffered a battle on the bonds with a snow shovel last winter and has not been quite the same since he drivers and drawers and drawers and grabbers turn and turn about. And was it this particular burger who commissioned you to examine the snows of yesteryear? Yes, it was. Did you not stop to consider that any comparison you made between the snow currently enveloping pointy town and the snows of yesteryear would be futile. They Josh that my middle name is futility. So you are the go to guy for fools errands. I live in a paradise of fools. I thought you said you lived in pointy town. Are you trying to pull the wool over my eye? Do you mean eyes? No. I am cyclopean a cyclopean janitor of snow bins? Yes. Ah I read about you in the psychology that I read about you in the cyclopean janitor of snow bins are best selling blockbuster paperback by pebble head. In which I have to say I was holding this presented so much so that I have taken legal action with a view to having the entire route of several million copies pulped. If you succeed, what will you do with all that pulp? I will shove it into an I will shovel it into an unrefrigerated container and ferry it to a remote storage facility also unrefrigerated and keep it in specially designed pulp bins. Would that be the same remote storage facility where you keep the snows of yesteryear? No, the one is refrigerated and the other is not. So you would need to be in two places at once to perform your janitorial duties. No, I would employ a cyclopean pub been janitor.

If I pluck out one of mine eyes, could I have the job? There is a waiting list of applicants. How could I shove myself to the front of that list? with sharp elbows can consider them sharpened Welcome aboard.

That was meant to be a dialogue of two people. I shouldn't really have tried to do the entire thing by myself using my using only one voice. Perhaps I should have tried to do a different voice but I can't do that convincingly. Anyway, I hope you got the gist. And until you heard that the snows of yesteryear were being kept in bins in a remote and refrigerated storage facility. Due to a security alert however, the bins were moved while I was reading that out. A fleet of trucks ferried the snow in the bins to a secret location. The trucks were refrigerated as to we must assume is the secret location. Because it's secret. I cannot tell you where it is. I don't even know myself. But what this means is that we cannot answer the question. Where are the snows of yesteryear? Obviously we can answer that they are in a secret refrigerated location. But that's hardly satisfactory. The more persistent reporters from the winter weather phenomena press are unlikely to return to their igloo offices, only to face the wrath of their white bearded icicles strewn editors know they will think up as a more cunning ways to phrase their questions, hoping to trip up the snow authorities. The snows of yesteryear Where are they? They might ask or yester year the snows of whatever happened to them. Sooner or later a dimwit on the panel will blurt out the precise coordinates of the secret location and frenzy will ensue. Some snow frenzy is akin to snow fury, and we are reminded of the best selling paperback like a woman scorned by ever snow fury. It was in fact by pebble head writing under a pseudonym. There is a rogue edition purporting to be by Ella for no fury copies of which of fetch sums as high as 15 shiny new pens on eBay.

I don't keep a diary, but I do have a day book. My day book has a yellow cover, like a fantasy Aquila symbolist publication, whereas the cover of my night book is as black as the black black heart of Prince Fulgencio. Indeed, the precise shade of black was created by replicating to the nth degree, the blackness at the heart of the prince's black heart, as depicted in the official mezzotints. a dumb bear loomed over the shoulder of the mezzotint just as he worked as dumb bears do in certain tails. Once you've probably forgotten for you did not pay proper attention when sat at your mother's knee if she read to you about dumb bears, and mezzotint is on the black black heart of principle genesio from those dogeared storybooks. So many years ago, all the illustrations in the book had been torn out and used as makeshift wallpaper for the bomb shelter was the loveliest of bomb shelters. Lovely and subterranean, and before the wallpaper was pasted up, the walls clanged when you wrap them with your tiny fist. Since then, worms have eaten their way through the walls, huge, wriggling toxic albino worms like something from a nightmare. It is said by some that such worms nor their way into principle genties black heart while he yet lived, and that was what made him so terrible and terrifying a prince. But that did not stand up in court, nor in the star chamber. I keep my night book in my star chamber, and my day book in the pantry. Oh, it's the loveliest of pantries. Lovely and subterranean and filled with job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job. After job after job after job after job. After job after job after job after job after job after job. After job after job. After job. After job after job. After job after job, after job after job after job after job after job after job after job after job, and a jelly drug for drugged Kelly.

Every week on hooting yelled on the air. For new listeners, we have a weekly quiz. That's completely untrue. I don't know why I said it. We don't have a weekly quiz. But we do have a quiz this week. And this week's quiz is I have just told you what I keep in my pantry. And to win this week tip top prize, which I haven't yet decided what it is. All you have to do is repeat exactly. And I mean exactly what I keep in my pantry. You need to speak into a tape recorder send me a tape recording. That's old technology. I'm sure there are new ways of doing that. And the first correct answer drawn from a hat, an upturned hat with answers in it will win a prize. But it has to be an exact list of what I keep in my pantry. Anyway, elsewhere slaloming down from my there, no slaloming from my chalet down to the post office. I stopped short when I saw the edge of a cravat a monkey encased in a block of ice. I'm no expert on monkeys. And I wasn't sure what kind of Monkey It was. It was between a quarter and a third of the size of an average human if such a thing exists. I made a note with a propelling pencil in my drafting pad to remind me of the precise location, then carried on down to the post office at the foot of the mountain. I transacted my business at this distance in time I cannot remember what it was and made my way to the funicular railway station, stopping off to buy a pastry snack and a bag of plums. I told the conductor that I wanted to alight before my usual chalet level stop. He raised one eyebrow and gave me a quizzical look, but dented my ticket with his metal ticket dinner. Without further comment. The windows of the carriage was steamed up so I could not see the thing outside. I lit my pipe and we began to Creek slowly upwards. I got off when the conductor gave me the nod and trudged over to the crevasse. In my absence, the block of ice had not thought one iota if anything, it had frozen to even more Anton solidity not surprising given the foul weather, the sun had been obscured by clouds and mist and bad air for three or four days on the trot. I've tapped my permiten knuckle on the ice. But of course, the monkey inside did not stir. How could it it too was frozen solid. My first thought had been to melt the ice in secu, releasing the monkey dangerously close to the crow bath. If upon regaining consciousness, it bounded off in the direction of the gaping chasm, and looked as if it might plunge to its death. I hoped to forestall such a calamity by tempting it with plums or pastry. But while aboard the funicular railway, I had become peckish extinguished my pipe, and in half the plums and the entire pastry. I had to rethink my plans, it would make far more sense to haul a block of ice up to my chalet and to melt it there. This would have the advantage that I could immediately put the frozen monkey in a place of comfort my sofa or my bed, so that when it eventually awoke, it would be less likely to panic and plunge down Accra vath. The problem now was how to transport the block of ice up the unforgiving mountainside. Monkeys I knew were barred from the funicular railway, and with good reason. I was barely strong enough to clamber up hill unencumbered, let alone shoving like ciphers a block of ice containing a monkey ahead of me. For one wild moment, I envisioned a helicopter sweeping down rope dangling to ferry my cargo to the chalet. But of course, the mountain and its hinterland for miles in every direction, were a no fly zone, according to directive number 17. What I always found puzzling, incidentally, was the impossibility of finding out what on earth directives number one to 16 were, nobody seemed to know or at least nobody was willing to tell.

Then I remembered that I had in my cupboard in the chalet a very lengthy length of sturdy chain, it should be possible to affect one end of this to the block of ice, and to devise a contraption which with minimal effort for me, for example, dainty movements of my little fingers would drag the block of ice up to my chalet. satisfied, I lit my pipe and waited for the funicular railway to resume my journey up and home. While I waited, I appeared the monkey inside the ice, or as much of it as I could see, which in truth was very little. Sometimes ice is crystal clear, but this block was somewhat more opaque. It gave the monkey a blurred quality, as if viewed by a catastrophic Lee myopic person, or seen in a dream. I had often dreamed of such monkeys blurry, Ill defined and ominously still. It had never occurred to me to wonder what these dreams might mean, as if they could possibly mean anything. starlin has always seemed to me a far better guide than Freud. That is why I have a hammer and sickle emblem mailed to the door of my chalet to renounce my stance to any visitors, thus averting the risk of futile conversations. And the funicular railway carriage arrived on schedule, and I clambered aboard, and I smoked my pipe and ate the remainder of the pipe plums and I alighted at my usual stop, and I went home, and I devised a contraption to drag the block of ice up the mountain slope, and I fetched the train from the cupboard, and I fixed one end of it to the bracket on the contraption, and gave it a hefty tug to ensure it was secure. And I started to make my way slaloming back down the mountain, paying out the train behind me until I came to the block of ice with the monkey inside it. And I wrapped the train round and round the ice and gave it a hefty tug to ensure it was secure. And I returned to the funicular railway stop to wait for the carriage to take me back up hill, and then I began to feel peckish again, and instead of going home, I slaloms down to the village and bought another pastry and another bag of plums and I sat on a stone bench next to a statue of Starling. scuffed the pastry and the plums and when I was replete, I fell into Windows right there on the bench. And I dreamed of a monkey blurry, Ill defined an ominously still. I can hardly believe that 50 years have passed since that day.

I'm sniffy about science fiction. The genre doesn't appeal to me. Over the years, I've read several sci fi book, or essays, or speculative fiction, or whatever the preferred term is these days. And now I've enjoyed some of them mildly. I feel no great urge to read more widely in the field. Similarly, with the cinema, there are a few sci fi films I like, but in general, I'll actively avoid them. I've never, for example, seen Star Wars, nor any of its seemingly inordinate sequels and prequels. Despite not having seen it, I tend to agree with the critic who suggested that its success destroyed American cinema, and the vast majority of films turned out by Hollywood, a pap and pap of a certain kind for which George Lucas is to be held, personally responsible. In addition to being sniffy about sci fi, I'm also diabetic. Until recently, these two parts of my life could coexist without hoo ha. I have to drive myself with insulin daily as a direct result of the debauchery of my wilderness years. I don't find this particularly onerous, and if anything acts as a useful reminder to me not to revisit those chaotic stupidities. But a few weeks ago, after seeing a consultant whose resemblance to Brian ino is so eerily close that I would swear brain one is moonlighting as an NHS doctor, my regimen was changed. Instead of injecting one type of insulin novo mix, Brian recommended my diabetes would be better managed by using two different preparations. It is the names of these that make me feel daily, like an unwilling collaborator in some awful sci fi adventure. I don't know who is responsible for the nomenclature of insulin solutions, whomsoever it is, clearly gave no thought to the psychic damage wrought upon my tattered nerves by forcing me to inject humor log, and the even more sci fi sounding Lantus solostar. In hindsight, no vo mix itself sounds like the name of a distant star in a galaxy far, far away. When imagined this is the setting where dashing space hero, Lantus solostar does battle with the bumbling robots known as Houma logs. Don't give me strength.

So there you go. That was actually a bit of autobiographical information about Mr. Key you don't get that every day on loading yard? Well, you do because all the stories I read with a first person narrator are of course, entirely true and based on my own life. So I did once slalom down a mountainside and say a monkey in case the lies I did. On Thursday morning, bam, bam, went haywire. That's all I'm prepared to say on the subject. You may have questions, such as who or what is bam, bam. What is the etymology of the word haywire. And so on. But quite frankly, it's not up to me to spoon feed you. I felt I fail to see why you should not do your own research into these matters, thus freeing me for more important tasks, such as taking a well earned nap, smoking a gasp or gazing out of the window, or stuffing My God with a pile of smokers popped up. Any of those choices would be a better use of my time than telling you about bam bam going haywire. Oh, please, please miss the key. I hear you while do tell us more. To which I replied Certainly not. Most, I might give you some pointers to help you conduct your own research. For the etymology of the word haywire. I can think of no better reference source than the Oxford English Dictionary. Oh wait. I can think of a better source Dobson's pamphlet, everything you want to know about Hi, and words beginning with Hey, out of print. In fact, I'm surprised not to have recommended this pamphlet to you before, it seemed most hay centric of all Dobson's work, and its first edition of 10 standard copies actually had a cover to which strands of real high were fixed with glue. This had the unfortunate effect of partly obscuring the title, with the result that the pamphlet sold even fewer copies than was usually the case. If you do your research thoroughly, you will probably be exhausted by the time you're fully conversant with the word haywire. Your head will be so crammed with new and exciting information, that there will be no room left to add anything at all. That being so it seems rather pointless for me to tell you where you could discover further information about bam-bam. Nevertheless, there will always be one or two scallywags who don't know when to stop, who will plow on regardless, such persons are very exasperating like hyperactive tots and should not be encouraged. I find the best way to deal with them is to administer a dose of ox stun, a proprietary tranquilizer more commonly used to stand oxygen at such times as one needs to stand oxygen, which depending on circumstances can be every Thursday morning, or once in a blue moon. Now everybody sing along Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone.

That is the end of this week's show. I will be back next week. And we'll be back next week with more of this stuff. And until when I hope you have happy dreams of blurred, immobile ill defined monkeys. Bye bye
