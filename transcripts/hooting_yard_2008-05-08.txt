Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. very fond of his blotter whenever he wrote about it, which was more often than considered normal for a grown man, his prose attains a pitcher of purple enthusiasm, modern readers can find uncomfortable, not to say distressing. It has been said that the pamphleteer even had a pet name for his blotter as if it were an animal being like a puppy or a hamster. But nobody claims to know what it was citation needed, as they say on the Wikipedia. There has been some debate of crushing tedium as to whether Dobson's attachment was to the blotter itself, or to the sheets of blotting paper, he inserted under it for leatherette corner flaps. He made something of a ritual of this, changing his blotting paper every Thursday afternoon, at about four o'clock, just before he had a cup of tea and a plate of bloaters. He seems to have inserted a fresh sheet irrespective of the state of the one to be discarded. As often as not, his blessing paper remained pristine, as he almost always wrote in pencil. For use cheats he kept in a cardboard box shoved underneath the sink in an outbuilding. Each time he filled the box, he said created it somewhere like a squirrel and went to who Berman's department store to get a new cardboard box to date nobody has ever discovered where he hid all those boxes of slightly used blotting paper. It's one of the enduring mysteries, beloved of Dobson lists. The blotter itself was unexceptionable as blotters go, it was a flat leatherette rectangle with corner flaps under which the four corners of a sheet of blotting paper were tucked. several witnesses have noted that, contrary to what one might expect, the blotter was not always in place on the pamphleteers s crosswalk. Sometimes he left it leaning up right against the wainscot. At other times, he put it in a bag and carried it around with him for no apparent purpose. It was not unknown for him to eat his bloaters off it, also use it as a birth table. Dobson was fantastically ignorant of the diet of birds though, and would place his blotter on top of an upright stick in the garden, and then scatter hard toffee marbles upon it. Such confectionery was avoided by any little birds or lighting on the blotter bird table, for rare is the bird which can digest hard toffee. They would also risk breaking their little beaks on it, for Dobson's preferred toffee marbles, which we bought in paper bags from a peddler. were the hardest known to humankind, and he gave them an extra bake in his oven for hours at a time to make them harder still. In a new as yet unpublished book, Pam clog and glove ages tell the story of how Dobson's blotter was stolen and later recovered. melodramatically, the pamphleteer once described this as the worst week of my life on a rambunctious Wednesday, when the Zodiac was in a meaningless alignment. The pamphleteer decided he needed to stiffen the back of his blotter to restore its rigidity. He filled the pail with starch, and carefully lowered the blotter into it, and then he strode off full of them to blister lane lied over waterpolo practice. Dobson was a keen if inept player of that most thrilling of aquatic team sports. And he wrote a number of pamphlets about it, the best of which is probably a new and improved method of drying your park with a towel out of print. In standard Water Polo, of course, parks are not used, but the blister lane academicals the team Dobson belong to was no ordinary waterpolo team. Nor was this an ordinary practice on this fateful Wednesday, for the coach wanted the team to try out a new tactic which involved distracting their opponents by imitating the cause of loons and shoveler ducks and grackles. By the time he returned home, Dobson was hoarse and exhausted, he went straight to the room in which he had left his blotter steeped in a pile of starch. was distraught to find it gone. The pail itself had been knocked over and the starch had soaked into the floorboards. Here is how Pam plug and glove ages describe what happened next.

Dobson cried out, Dobson sobbed. Dobson crashed about the house. Dobson called detective Captain Kirk pan. Dobson told detective Captain kargh Pam that his blotter had been stolen. Dotson sat in a chair and waited for detective Captain Kirk pan to arrive. Dobson drank a tumbler of milk from a goat. See, Dobson said, See Dobson drink. This sort of thing becomes tiresome after a few dozen pages, but I admire the author's attention to detail. Apparently they won a medal for an earlier book about the Watergate hearings. What we learn in this new work is that the thief was a contemptible scoundrel with a pencil mustache, the look of a startled rabbit. A fixation upon blotters a cute pair of gloves, a corrective boot, a skewed sense of morals, a weak chin, a hacking cough, a sordid past, the width of a drain pipe, a collapsing lung, a dubious parentage of socks and other cravat, bats in his Belfry shares in the Bradford and Bingley building society, corks on his uppers, clumps in his pocket, catastrophic measles scars, renter is vinegar in his ears, and sausages on the brain. Detective Captain Kirk pan tracked him down for days after the theft of Dobson's blotter hiding out in a house of miscreants hard by the banks of Lake foofy. Dobson's first words when one of detective Captain card pans henchmen returned the blotter to him at a rendezvous in a dismal canteen. We're thank you so much for retrieving my Natty blotter. studious Dobson is will recognize that as the title of a dirge the pamphleteer composed for the second international Anthony Burgess festival of uncompromising dodges in olm, where it one sec 15th Prize,

which the title of which was Dobson's blotter, attracted a letter of complaint from a reader of the website when it appeared. Who wrote Dennis the key as someone with sausages on the brain, I was dismayed to notice that you listed this condition as among the characteristics of the contemptible scoundrel who stole Dobson's blotter. We are no more likely to turn to criminality than any other common or garden person you might encounter among the teeming masses, and suggest otherwise is deeply unhelpful. I run a support group for people with sausages on the brain. And I'm proud to say we do a lot of good work. We have organized sponsored archeological digs, for example, and also other sorts of digging with spades and shovels, and special little forks in loose soil, with prizes donated by wealthy television personalities, some of whom are newsreaders who give their time freely, almost freely say for small administrative fees for the greater good. It might surprise you to know that some of these magnetic personalities have sausages on the brain themselves. And they're proving successful in life, rather than languishing in prisons after being convicted of blosser theft. digging up the ground in pursuit of archeological knickknacks, or just for the fun of it is not the only activity we sponsor. Last month we held a fundraising event at the perimeter of a remote airfield. There were balloons and ice cream wafers and clay pigeon shooting and a brand tab and scale model trench warfare novelty sing songs and inflatable cloud chamber Daredevil rides and all sorts of other things hosted by Jimmy Savile, and the whole event passed off without any police involvement whatsoever, apart from a couple of cases of moral besmirch. You can check the police log for yourself, and you will find not a scintilla of evidence that anyone with sausage on the brain thieved as much as a scrap of blotting paper, let alone an entire blotter. It is true that the stationery department who Berman's has installed a state of the art electronic security system with bleepers and klaxons and magnetic resonance panels for the exclusive detection of people with sausages on the brain, who might find themselves wandering in a footloose and shabby manner they're in. But that's just a sensible precaution in this disgusting world. Support Group was happy to provide advice to Huberman his management team when a delegation visited our headquarters here on the at all our single rowing boat plies back and forth to the mainland twice a week by the way, stories that the boats Captain has to be bribed with frankfurters are completely baseless, as is the vindictive tittle tattle, suggesting there is a leak in the boat, and that constant bailing with buckets is required in order not to drown the sea hear about is not always wild and dangerous, and attacks by shrieking demented guillemots have become much rarer, with only a handful of lacerations to passengers heads reported last Thursday. uninvited visitors to the at all are never beaten insensible, with heavy cast iron frying pans, as has been reported in the scummy end of the press. We abandoned this custom some weeks ago after a plenary vote. Of course, if a wayfaring stranger turns up without a gift of boiling the bag sausages for the welcoming committee that is construed as unforgivable bad manners and the culprit simply gets what's coming to them. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind and sometimes you just have to be cruel, cackling like a maniac as you enact your cruelties. That's always been my motto. In fact, I have it tattooed across my chest and my back in vivid in purpled Gothic lettering with flamboyant curlicues and bloodstains. Just try telling me I'm wrong. And I'll meet you at dawn at a place of your choosing somewhere out on the malls to engage in hand to hand combat, providing you do not try to enhance your musculature with chemical boosters.

Here at the sausage on the brain support network. We fight ferociously, but fairly, as you will be able to see it firsthand if you attend one of our daily rehearsal bouts daubed with the blood of goats and wearing special contact lenses to give them hallucinate revisions. The best of our warriors would curdle the fluids of the most jaundiced observer. Even Jimmy Savile swooned when we laid on a display for him, and I'm not sure he's ever fully recovered. So by all means, make your spiteful little remarks about us. But be warned that our vengeance will be immediate and savage and utterly ridiculously disproportionate. Yours faithfully, sausages on the brain person.

I'd like to move swiftly on there were three examples of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. Our first example of uncontrollable flapping about and twittering took place in a pantry cluttered with jars in much disorder. Some of the jars contained glue or curd, or pips, or suid in varying quantities, and some of the jars were empty. None were clean. All the jars had a coating of grime, as if they had laid untouched for many moons, as indeed they had. For this was an abandoned pantry. The lid of the jars would not have been easy to loosen, had a determined person entered the pantry bent upon loosening the lid of any one of the jars, perhaps to eke out some goo or curd or pips or Sue it or perhaps to pour into one of the empty jars, a new and exciting substance. And Hark, here comes such a person a wheezing person stomping down the passage towards the pantry and kicking the door in. He is a livery attendant, gone to seed and become a brute and he is holding a hand He has come to smash all the jars in the pantry, for he has lost all sense of decorum. And then an angel of the Lord appears all a shimmer and command him to lay down his hammer and to leave the cluttered jars I'm touched. This is when the person begins flapping about and twitching uncontrollably for about 30 seconds in fear and shame before fleeing the abandoned pantry that happened on a Thursday. The second example involves a peasant and a cow and many bees. It was a Saturday, the peasant had trudged into the fields to take a closer look at the cow, for the cow had been fractious and the peasant was concerned. Though unlettered, the peasant had a goodly store of country wisdom, and was confident that if the cow was sick, he would be able to identify the nature of its malady and to cure it. Like many a tragic hero in fiction, the peasant sought redemption for an enormity in his past, and then normally committed due to a character flaw. careful study of tragic heroes will reveal what they often have such a flaw, one thinks of Korea laners, for example, or Datsun, neither the nature of the presence of fatal flaw nor of the enormity for which he sought redemption need concern is here, for this is not a tragedy. It is just an example of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. In any case, it is reported rather than fiction. Fact being so the reader or listener is entitled to hard fact rigorously researched, and the winner winnowing out of all floppiness. That's why I've employed a hooting yard fact checker. So you can be absolutely sure that what you hear is the pure and unvarnished truth. Obviously, you need to have confidence in the person charged with the fact checking. And that's why I fought hard to get someone for the job who I know can be relied upon. Yes, it's easy to laugh at an ex schoolteacher pushing 60, who still wishes to be known as staying. But this was the man remember who first pointed out to the world that Russians love their children too. It's just such acuity of insight that makes him perfect for the job I have employed him to do. And for wet dry, pay him a pittance each month. Sting has promised to set up a hooting yard fact check website, so we can all look forward to that. I want to point out here that just as you can rely on me and sting to provide you with big tough facts. So in return, I expect a degree of attentiveness from you. Toe tapping head scratching and slashing out of the ears with some sort of wax crumbling fluid. These can surely wait until my report is done. That's the bargain we strike. So now we've got that cleared up like a rash. We can return to the peasant and the cow and the bees. But wait. You want to be sure that they are bees or not Hornet or wasps? Wait for a moment while I fire off a quick instruction to steam to check up on that. I've just realized how opposite is absurd nickname is for such a task.

Okay, I've sent my missive and I imagine that as I write sting is checking his encyclopedias and databases and whatnot. Unless I tell you otherwise, you can assume that the bees we're about to encounter in our second example of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching are indeed bees. So the peasant with the tragic flaw trudged into the field to look at the cow, hoping to ascertain the nature of its sickness. Because it was a Saturday the field was muddier than usual, the cow was standing more or less in the center of the field, gazing at nothingness in a cow like way. It's hawks had lost their shine, and the cardboard tags stapled to one of its ears was smudged. In this day and age, it's quite common for cows to have pieces of cardboard or plastic stapled to there is serving a number of purposes. And the staplers used are not so different from the staplers used in offices up and down the land. Sting told me that As he approached the cow, the peasant tried to dredge from his memory some of the folk wisdom with which had been crammed since infancy. He remembered if your cow is sick on a Monday morning, go and spit upon a spade just as the day is dawning, but that was no use to him as it was Saturday. He remembered Cow Cow blotchy and stiff, spray it with a bottle of Jeff. But that particular spell lost its efficacy when Jeff product were renamed safe as part of a marketing exercise early in the 21st century. And he remembered, your cow is sick, it's got bird flu, but the Russians love their children too. As a piece of countryside law, this was useless Of course, as it did not suggest any remedies for the sick cow. But it is evidence of the extent to which the terrific profundities spouted by my fact checking employee have entered the collective wisdom of the world. Be that as it may, before the peasant got a chance to inspect the cow, a swarm of bees came in from the west and buzzed menacingly about his head. Q is uncontrollable, flapping about and twitching perfectly understandable in the circumstances. The bees harried the peasant until he turned tail and fled the field on that Saturday morning. The cow By the way, had only a minor ailment from which it recovered without human intervention. Although I understand that it's currently in a cow based 12 step program in an adjoining field. As for the peasant, he would have to await a new challenge, to redeem himself from the peccadilloes of his past, whatever they were,

we move on now breathlessly, but with vigor to the third and last of our examples of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching, forget pantries. Forget peasants. This is a case of an earthly sci fi stuff set on a spaceship roaring through galaxies unimaginably distant. on a Tuesday evening, Captain Biff buckle beam is at the controls on the deck of the USS milk toast Jesuit. He's a bit like Captain James T. Kirk from Star Trek, but has a much larger head and a speech impediment. As he likes to joke. It has been no impediment to his rise through the ranks of starship command, which has been meteoric Captain Beth is still only 12 years old. Although such as the warps and weft of intergalactic space travel, that he is simultaneously 10,000 years old, as yet unborn and akin to a god. Hard to get your head round I know, and probably too much of a challenge for sting who's still working on those bees. The USS milk toast Jesuit is sponsored by L'Oreal and is powered by light reflecting booster technology, just like Andy McDowell's hair. Captain Beth is contractually bound to use various L'Oreal hair products. But if he had his way he would smear his ginger mark with grease from the engine room. He's that kind of Captain when danger threatens, as it often does, he towels his mop with one hand while punching the starships complicated Control Panel expertly with the other all the while barking out commands to his crew. His accent is a curious mixture of Wyoming Luxembourg and vampire. He's extremely fond of Yana tricks, String Quartet number one, the Kreutzer Sonata and likes to have it played by the starship band at moments of high peril when they are otherwise engaged. For example, if they've been beamed down to a newly discovered planetoid to give an impromptu concert of Thomas Beecham lollipops, Captain Beth loses his rag and flies into a temper tantrum with much uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. So I hope you found these three examples helpful. You can add your own examples at on the hooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org go to three examples of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching and leave your own examples in the comments. And please note that as soon as sting gets back to me about the bees, I'll add his findings there as opposed to score

Let's turn our attention now to the world of computer gaming. There's been a fantastic boughs in the industry as we approach the launch of the latest version of one of the most popular games on the planet. A multi billion dollar money spinner, instantly recognizable from the three letters D WD. I'm speaking of course of grovel with a Dampier, the cardboard and chicken wire strategy game that numbers among its fans, Yoko Ono, Dale Winton, President gurbanguly berdimuhamedov of Turkmenistan and Stephen Fry. I've been fortunate enough to get a sneak preview of version four. And let me tell you, it's everything it's cracked up to be. As with the earlier releases, the basic concept of grovel with Dampier is deceptively simple. Sorry, that's not quite right. There's no deception involved. It is simple. You the player, a company a simulacrum of buccaneering see Captain William Dampier, 1651 to 1715 on his three circumnavigation of the globe, every now and then you both disembark from your ship, whether it be the signet, the St. George or the Juke. And you grovel in the stinking muddy tide waters of whichever landmass you are at the edge of. Then your hair festooned with kelp, and your eyes sore from salt water, you clamber back onto your ship and voyage onwards to seek further groveling grounds. aficionados will be pleased to learn that most if not all of the irritating additional features have been removed from this new edition, allowing players to concentrate fully on the essence of the game. So there's no distracting music, no bleeps and blips on the high resolution graphics, just a sheet of cardboard and some chicken wire and the opportunity to pretend you really are groveling with Dampier does it get any better than this?

I mentioned earlier that whenever Dobson wrote about His blosser His pros attained a picture of purple enthusiasm, and it may be that he was influenced by the great how Kay wells here to end this week show is a quotation from Blackpool for hell maidens bar how k wells. Carlin's deep shadow dies with flaming pools of Mad menace. I could shoot you both down where you stand, he rasped but that would be a foolish waste of valuable material. I shall turn the two of you over to the dweller in the pool. Dorothy lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's thin lips rived in a snarling smile. Who or what is the dweller in the pool? demanded Kent. And what devil's work is Carlin doing here anyway? The dweller in the pool? Dorothy answered her low voice trembling is my brother, Raul. Small wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine to tame to the very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitus and dread. Yes, and that's the end of this week's show. I hope you're not feeling a shuttering measure of crap and dread, but rather something else entirely. I don't know. something. Something else? Anyway, I'll be back next week with more pros from hooting yard. Bye
