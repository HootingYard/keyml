Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com on your computer computer This is hitting you out on the air. My name is Frank key. And I've just returned from a holiday on foreign shores. refreshed revivified and ready to shower you once again with sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. I'm not going to tell you much if anything about my jaunt. But I think it is worth noting that I met on my travels, a man called Dave from Australia, who when young used to dye chickens, different colors. JOHN fat John's found that very amusing. And you might be able to hear him laughing, which is a good thing, because I don't know I might be babbling into a microphone to nobody. So, Kevin Anyway, I'll read that sentence. No one read it. Hey, St. Chicken died. I will I've never met one before. Anyway, I met this black day from Australia, who when young used to dye chickens, different colors. It wasn't entirely clear to me whether he did this as a form of paid employment or for his own entertainment. It might conceivably have been art. I mentioned this because it occurred to me that an antipathy and kickin Dyer would could prove a useful recurring character in the various doings recounted here at hooting yard. We shall see. Oh, one other thing. I was startled to discover that Dave was unable to name the four members of the seekers. Now I have long believed with good reason that it is the mark of any civilized person, and certainly of any civilized Antipodean. They can rattle off those names without even having to think much as one might say at rest. JOHN, Paul, George and Ringo, not forgetting Yoko, of course, or Matthew, Mark, Luke and john, or winking, blinking and nod. I have no doubt that every single one of my listeners will be as baffled as I was by Dave's inability in this regard. Perhaps a lethal chemical constituent of the dyes used on those chickens long ago, we designed his brain pans. And I'm sure all of you listening if there are any apart from john, I'm sure all of you listening know the names of the speakers. But if you don't, let's have a reminder, john. Johnny wouldn't have access to a sort of instant seekers song. machine.

Unknown Speaker  04:00
I actually Yes, I do.

Frank Key  04:03

Frank Key  06:43
Well, if you didn't recall the names before, I'm sure you do now that you've heard that anyone who doesn't know the names of the four speakers shouldn't be listening to this show. You should be in a library looking at a reference book of Australian pop stars of the 1960s. And interestingly, one thing I learned was that that song colors of my life was originally called chicken in the bath. And I changed the lyrics I think. It's called chick, the chorus would kick in in the bath, which may have had something to do with Dave and his died chickens. I don't know. Anyway, let's move on to something entirely dissimilar. This is a piece called the nylon juke. They hold the nylon juke. He is fashioned entirely from nylon. every last bit of in Yeah, even under his cartilages he is a nylon wonder of the world. The nylon juke is pulled along flat on his back on a cart by a great great dry horse with its brightened battering sandal, from village to village. At each stop along the way, in villages, leafy or otherwise, he is hoisted upright by a system of winches and pulleys. The villagers gather and gasp and golf at the site of the nylon juke. They bring offerings of potatoes and similar root vegetables piled high on the cart before being transferred into sacks by the nylon Dukes attendance. These attendance are not made of nylon. Elsewhere, there is a nylon duchesse and then maybe a nylon Doh fan. And there are even rumors of a nylon dance. But in this land, there are not enough great grade dry horses to put them on cart around villages. a dearth of grey horses is an oft reprinted tract which goes some way to explaining this situation. Consider the nylon group in the round in all his pomp and finery and nylon or city would you be granting your potatoes Think hard before you answer for fig Ida rent print school binder ad fig as it is written as it is engraved as it is tattooed upon the foreheads of the attendance. The nylon juke given name is Bob

Frank Key  10:16
Now, while you've been listening to that music, john was asking me what the connection is between the seekers who are fabulous, and the new seekers who are nauseating. And I said I didn't know and I didn't think there was any connection. And maybe there was some kind of management thing where they got to call themselves the new seekers. Anyway, um Yeah. What were you saying?

Unknown Speaker  10:42
that it's okay to keep posture, posture, posture, one of the secrets after the no seekers disbanded. He he put together the new seekers in in Britain in London, wherever. And he did perform and record with them. Not all the time though. But yes. They are the new seekers of course. I remember Marty krisztian used to be in Jackie magazine. My sister's sketch Jackie. And yeah, they did they sang I'd like to teach the world to sing and well Exactly.

Frank Key  11:24
I mean, dealin viola, my fav my favorite about the seekers and the new seekers and you won't find another full write me. I try not to think about new speakers. For me comparing the new speakers to the tutorial the seekers to the new speakers, is like, is like comparing the Sex Pistols to take that take

Unknown Speaker  11:44
it out with Keith Potter.

Frank Key  11:46
Yeah, I hate the pot Joe's gone down in my estimation. I think he's has a lot to answer for. I didn't know that there was that direct link other than the nicking the name. I think we're gonna have to have another little little quick break while I while I get myself together after hearing that news, okay.

Frank Key  12:56
It was said of Captain nitti that he had the gift of the gab. We shall not pause here to define the gab. But instead press on. Press on for time is tight. Time is as tight as Captain knitties tunic a size too small, the color of which constricts his throat swollen thwarting the gab. And without the gab this man is nothing. Why then does he not tear off his tunic and cast it to the wind or at least loosen his collar so that he might give vent to the gab? To answer that question or questions. We need to know something of the regulations and the esteem in which they were held. Then there. They were draconian and pitiless Alani yielding, yet a man would think no more of bending them, then he would have tearing off his own head and tossing it into a stream. It is in midstream of a rushing gurgling current that we find Captain nitti on this 19th century day. He is in it up to his eyeballs, breathing through a lever and gutta percha contraption strapped his head, covering his mouth and nostrils, and with a cube reinforced with the wire from pipe cleaners, rising above the level of the torrent into the air, no gabb from Captain nitti in the circumstances. But gab or something like it from the riverbank, where Captain nitti is closely observed by howler monkeys, disporting in the trees, how then rather than gab, the monkeys watch his slow progress as he tolls along the river against the current of their house House of encouragement or of mockery. Captain Nick Here's the knot for the same contraption that affords him the ability to breathe muffled his hearing it's thick woolen ear flaps, tugs tight against his head by means of a strap buckled under his chin as tight as his tunic. It is perhaps a mercy he can hardly hear the howler monkeys. Each step is a struggle, and now and then he loses his footing and is submerged in the torrent. He manages to pull himself up right through pluck and vim. For balance, he has a stick. It is not a branch torn from a river bank tree, but he's regulations stick thick of tropical wood with a golden knob. He holds it horizontally in front of him just above the surface of the water. For at all costs, he must not get it wet. Even when he loses his footing, he takes care to hoist the stick higher, keeping it in the air, though the top of his head is briefly below the waterline. Here in midstream, there is no tree to cut tree cover to block out the sun. It's burning brilliant batters down, reflected in the golden knob on the end of Captain nisi stick the golden knob itself as bright as a miniature sun. Captain that he must keep one eye closed in consequence to me is not blinded by it. As he makes his painfully slow progress at river, he now and then switches the position of the stick. So the golden knob is on his left or his right to rest one eye and employ the other. It is difficult for them to judge distance with but one working I he thought he would reach the rapids at least two hours before he does so. River Rapids, bane of the unwary, but Captain nitti is nothing if not wary. He has the gift of the gab and he has a nose for danger. He has been called reckless and tes tres excessive gung ho. Just as promised, there is a small wood and canvas boat tied to the trunk of a tree at the river's edge. Captain nitti makes for it and clambers in. Now at last he can remove the contraption from his head, his senses are assailed by the howling of the howler monkeys now deafeningly loud, and by the stink of rotten foulness a disease and death.

Frank Key  17:44
He places his regulation gold, knobbed tropical wood stick carefully in the bottom of the boat and lifts the oars sliding them through the foals. One would think watching him that he has rode a boat before, but he has not. But of course, there is nobody watching him. Nobody human, only the howler monkeys, and the billions of tiny buzzing winged things with which the air is riddled. Captain nitti pulls on the oars and heads inexhaustibly for the rapids. Now he has his back to the shining golden knob on his stick laid at his feet, and they can keep both eyes open. On the other side of the rapids, if he negotiates them without being tossed from his boat. He has been told to find a patch of land by the riverside and set up camp. He has in his have a sack the makings of a tent, a stove, a flag, a pack of playing cards, and a Bible. And at nightfall, there's the howler monkeys howl and nocturnal birds Hooton, screech, and the raging torrent rules. Captain nitti will cast off his tunic and hang up on a clothesline improvised between two trees. And while his sausages cook on the stove, he will give vent to his gift of the gab. He will plant his flag and name his camp, a name all the land around, he will sing rousing hymns He will bless the Lord. Oh, Captain nitties soul and all that is within him, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all Captain he's in equities, who he lifts all his diseases, who redeems his life from destruction, who crown of captivity with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfied his mouth with good things so that his youth is renewed like the eagle's. The Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all those who are oppressed. He made known his ways under Moses, his acts onto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever. He has not dealt with Captain nitti after his sins, nor rewarded him according to his iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them, that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed Captain duties transgressions from him, like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him, for he know if Captain did his frame, he remembers that he is dust. As for Captain nity, his days are as grass as a flower of the field. So he flourishes for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and the price there of shall not it no more, but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them, that fear Him and His righteousness unto children's children. to sack just keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them. The Lord have prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruler over all. Bless the Lord Captain nitti and his angels that excel in strength, that do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his that do this pleasure, but as the Lord all his works in all places of his dominion, Bless the Lord, O Captain nitti. He has the gift of the gab and sausages to eat, and an empire to build

Frank Key  22:15
accountably I missed by seven years, the centenary of the replacement of tin by Allah minium in the manufacturer of what we still call tin foil. So often, we have boffins in Switzerland to thank for this innovation, namely, Dr. Lauber, Neha and see who opened the world's first aluminium foil rolling plant in me, Sheldon in 1910. For that, excuse me, for those of you and I know there are many who like to keep track of these things. Ms. Hoeven is in the canton of Thor Gao, author govia in ancient times the home of the people of the Finn culture, who apparently kept large numbers of pigs. As I say, I neglected to mention the centene array at the time. And I know that many listeners will have been drumming their fingers and patiently for the past seven years, wondering when I was going to get round to telling you what to do with all that tin foil you have accumulated in your kitchen drawer. Well, I'm delighted to say that long last, I can turn my attention to this splendidly versatile material. Just bear in mind that when I talk about tin foil, I mean aluminium foil, and I'm not expecting you to try to track down a stash of the old 10 stuff, even if there is any still available, which I suspect there is not. The best thing you can do with your tin foil is to fashion for yourself a conical tin foil hat. It is important that you make a cone shape rather than trying to mold the tin foil into the approximate shape of say, a Homburg or a trilby or a stovepipe hat. Though the wonder of tin foil is that always hat types could quite easily be made, you must stick to the cone. In part this is in homage to Jimmy Godard and the space and the star fellowship and the copper cone he used for daily communication with space people. But do not jump to the conclusion that your tin foil cone hat will help you to talk to space people they want. nor will it protect you from weird unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and beams and invisible hoo ha. If such phenomena exist, and can dislodge and jumble and even control we innards of your brain. They're hardly likely to be dissuaded by a sheet of tin foil are they? Nevertheless, when forming your surplus tin foil into a hat. It is well to pay tribute to Jimmy Godard The star fellowship. For as Jesus said, a prophet is not without honor, but in his own country and among his own kin, and in his own house, and he could there do no mighty work, Mark 645 but you can do mighty work wearing your conical tin foil hat. I'm thinking specifically of amateur dramatics. Some might call that leisure rather than work but believe you me if you put your heart and soul into it, am I too dramatic can feel like work and mighty work at that. There are several parts in the repertoire where the wearing of a conical tinfoil hat is absolutely essential. Consider for example, old Lampkin in The Man Who Came to Dinner in a shiny pointy hat by Belper, frisell. It is not admittedly a very big part. And for most of x two and three, the character has a pair of lies apparently dead on the floor of the parlor while all hell breaks loose around him. But just think of the applause that always greets his entrance and that ringing line. Hello, I've come to dinner and I'm wearing a shiny pointy conical hat. It is also worth bearing in mind that old ham kin gets to keep the hat on even after he is poisoned and stabbed and shot by the vengeful cassandre. He keeps it up. He keeps it on throughout x two and three lying motionless on the parlor floor. And that no time is a hat snatched by one of the other characters who get to wear in get to wear it instead.

Frank Key  26:41
That does of course happen in one of the other great conical tinfoil hat part. The squalid mute in Pepin stows. An inspector wearing a shiny pointy hat called the squalid mute, of course, turns out to be a police inspector, a revelation somewhat less revelator ease and pepinster intended, given his cack handed way of giving the game away in the place title. But that need not concern you. You will just need to make sure as the curtain falls at the end of each performance that you retrieve your conical tinfoil hat from the actor playing Sergeant piffle, who snatches the hat from atop the inspectors head in that riveting scene at the end of Act four, and wears it himself in a clever ploy to foil Jasper's attempt to gain Mrs. inheritance. It might be a creaking plot device. But whenever I've attended an amateur troupe performance of the play, it's never failed to bring the house down. There are other parts in some really Tip Top dramas, where the wearing of your conical tinfoil hat is not actually called for in the script, but just certain something to the character. You might get into arguments, or even fisticuffs with the director, if they're the type of director averse to the sporting of unnecessary conical tinfoil hats. If this is the case, the best thing to do is to say that you're under attack from weird, unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and beams and invisible who are and must wear the conical tinfoil hat of protection. Most theater directors, professional or amateur will succumb to such a protest, particularly if it is voiced in a wild and high pitched screech. If you love the very idea of amateur dramatics, you can still find advantageous opportunities for the wearing of your conical tinfoil hat, promenading loitering, and hiking are all suitable activities, particularly the latter, particularly in the rain, particularly if it is torrential. There is nothing quite like the sound of the incessant pinging of water on metal as you hike in your conical tinfoil hat through a teeming downpour. And that is the end of this week's show. Bye bye
