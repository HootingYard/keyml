Good evening. This is hooting out on the air with me Frank key. And it's gonna be a slightly different show this week because I want to read a pamphlet that wasn't written by me. It was written by Jimmy Godard and it's called cosmic friends. And it was published by the star fellowship. Not sure of the date but it from the internal evidence of the text dates from the late 80s. I think I've had the pamphlet since then it was sent to me probably about 15 years ago by someone called Nigel Smith. I didn't really know Nigel Smith. I met him once. So I'd like to say if it's unlikely event that Nigel Smith is listening. Thank you very much. Nigel said that this was one of the funniest things you've ever read. And I tend to agree with him. So without further ado, cosmic friends, by Jimmy Godard brotherhood of planets hands across the sky, sing a song of friendship that shall never die. Sing a song of logic, overcoming all guardianship and kindness till the stars child fall. comradeship sorry the print is tiny, and I am myopic. And here we go. My communications with extraterrestrials probably began before I realized it if I I've always been attracted to and interested in the idea of space travel. But matters did not become overt until when attending Sunbury Grammar School in 1960. At the age of 14, I pulled the book out of the school library entitled flying sources have landed by George Adamski and Desmond Leslie. This book fired my imagination and enthusiasm. In fact, a minus subculture was formed in the school, which was so alarmed the headmaster that he withdrew the book from the library. I found To my surprise that someone else at the school was interested Philip Hazleton, who has become a lifelong friend. He introduced me to the star fellowship, an organization devoted to communication with extraterrestrials. And in the coming years, we had many interesting visits to its founder, Tony wed of chiddingstone Kent, we were encouraged to try thought communication with spice people, a practice which I have continued, and which has brought me much help and interesting information. We're also interested in tapping the mysterious free energy, which the extraterrestrials allegedly use, and I brought through a design based on an image of an A with asterisks at the bottom. This was not a practical success, but it may be of use to future free energy inventors to mention it. The energy is thought to be the same mysterious power that pervades the laser system, and which I later made a device to detect. There were two incidents in 1961 which seemed to indicate a beginning of a true communication. In one case, I was in my bedroom and had a strong impression to watch the television news which was just starting on it was an item on flying sources. Very rare. I returned to my bedroom and looking out the window thought, let's see a real saucer if it was you. Immediately, I made out a tiny object black against the bright sky moving fast across my line of sight. When it disappeared behind the house, I rushed outside and was just in time to see it again before it vanished in the distance. The second was an incident on a les hunting trip to Leith hill with Philip Hazleton and another school friend Peter Hodges. We had come to a part where there was a barrier of trees and bushes between us and the open hillside. Philip told us to wait that he felt he had to go through alone. Shortly, Peter felt compelled to follow him. And the three of us witnessed another sighting similar to the previous one mentioned something which, if it was as far away as it appeared, was traveling very fast indeed. Sort of communication Continued and I became better at it. They're difficult to describe, I do not hear voices, I receive impressions which my brain seems to translate into words, when an urgent message has to be given my own voice can be used. Or, if in a place where this would be embarrassing, my fingers can write the message in the air or on a tabletop, for instance, it must have been in 1962 that in looking

into a mirror, I noticed the scar which I have had on my forehead since an injury at the age of five, and suddenly realized that it could extend into my brain and be causing the problems that have dogged me throughout my life. I feel this must have been a communication. Much later, I was to realize myself to be virtually living on half a brain, tutor non cooperation of the medical profession. I eventually, with advice and encouragement for my communicators, made a rudimentary brain scanner, which seemed to confirm this. It may have been at this time to that I was given the procedure I call recharging, involving lying in a circuit posture with feet crossed and hands behind the nape of my neck. This came together with a warning about overdoses and apparently involved absorbing free energy, which I was told is also a life force. heartbeat speeds up and breathing deepens during recharging, and I feel very dry afterwards and have to rinse my face and drink water. But there is a sense of well being when this is done. In 1986, this was changed to a shorter period in the posture, followed by a time of classic relaxation, not in a circuit form. My interest in flying saucers and thought communication continued. I edited the magazine saucer forum for a time, but nothing tangible happened until 1966. This was a time when I used to visit the UFO town of Warminster Wiltshire quite a bit. On one occasion, while traveling to Warminster in a car I saw with the others in the car, or hovering orange light high in the daylight sky. This remained for a few seconds, then blinked out without apparently moving. Excuse me, I was clearing my throat. We thought it was an omen for the trip, but in fact, we were washed out by torrential rain. The sighting Was it henden North London 1966 was also just after the skerton the mystery events had taken place in which Arthur Bryant had claimed a contact with occupants of a saucer in Devon. In 1965, I had reported for source a forum on the booth for a meeting Adamski did he come back, and at the 1966 star, rally, the last Arthur Bryant was present a very interesting and thought provoking occasion. But there were no overt communications there, except the tape voices received by Norman Oliver delivered in the described in the skirt and mystery. It is a moot point as to whether these were from space people. But there was an interesting communication at of all places saulsbury railway station in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone to help my condition. having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in other tongues of a flesh by George humped Williamson with their complicated circuit, I felt unqualified to build one. The answer wrapped back, just build a simple cone of copper. That's not beyond you is it? I sat up with a start. Surely space people would not talk like that. But it jerked me out of my self pity. And I began a regular daily use of a cone which my father made from a piece of scrap sheet copper.

I had several trips to Warminster with various people, including Skywalk who's on cradle Hill and clay Hill, a number of unusual moving lights were seen, but none of that could with certainty be said to be not artificial satellites. However, there was also a very different and strange occurrence in 1966. In this year, my parents and I had a package holiday to Holland, staying in a hotel in Utrecht, we had guided tours of all the usual things, trees, farms, Diamond markets, clog makers, tulip fields, etc. But most interesting here were two people We're in this hotel and travelled with our group. It was a young woman and a somewhat older looking man. They did not communicate with us much. But on at least one occasion, the woman sat next to my mother on the coach. They chatted, but she would not be drawn into revealing much of her own life, and did not seem to know much about English towns mentioned. She had an accent my parents could not place and my father noticed when going through passport control at the end of the holiday, that they did not have British passport, but somewhat smaller ones. But it was something my father mentioned after the holiday that made me sit up with a start. For man who never approached us had most unusual eyes with what appear to be vertical pupils. I remembered the scars and story I had heard in the lecture the year before, in which yam skis escorts also had this feature where they space people and what was their purpose, the contact with my mother seems to indicate that they wanted to make themselves known to me, but not actually to contact me. several important things would have happened in 1967. One was at the midsummer skywatch, organized by booth four and sedap at pewley, down near Guildford. I had previously been given the impression that it was important to use the cone at a powerful lay point that night, I located a lay center on the hogs back noted for its power in the skirt and mystery, and found there seem to be a clump there in the middle of a field. So I arranged to go to the purely walk and for my father to drive me to the hogs back just before midnight, about four miles away on the other side of Guildford. We stopped there form. We stopped there, and I realized that finding the clump after dark, might not be that easy, but I managed it. However, just as I was leaving the road my father called me back. A hovering orange object was seen to the west, which blinked out as the henden one had done. I proceeded to the clump and used the cone to the accompaniment of the sounds of night creatures. Then I returned to the watch to find the view for a party had also seen the object at the same time and in the same direction. Almost immediately after this, I received a phone call from a Squadron Leader ship right, who had apparently seen an unusual object from Newlands corner shortly after the skywatch. He had been walking with his wife at about midday when they saw what they took to be a white horse galloping in a field about a mile away. Newlands corner is a well known viewpoint. He soon saw, however, that it was not a horse, but an ovoid white object moving rapidly backwards and forwards, north south then South north. Then it stopped and proceeded slowly at right angles to its original course. On reaching a belt of trees, it rose slowly over them. They did not see it disappear, but astonishingly returned for lunch. at the earliest opportunity, my father Squadron Li real leadership right and myself visited the field and where the object had been moving rapidly. A number of pieces of sandstone were found. The largest was about 18 inches long and had a strange pattern seemingly incised in it. We took this and one of the smaller pieces. There were no such stones anywhere else in the field. Squadron Leader ship right expose the small piece to the weather at which it discovered in a few weeks, indicating the pieces had not been there very long. Even though the large piece was quite deeply embedded. Before he died some years later, he was very keen that I should have the small piece again, and I now have both but even more remarkable than this. I found

To my surprise that the markings on the stone corresponded to some lay like alignments I had found on a Mariner four space probe picture of part of the surface of Mars. I am convinced that here was some kind of extraterrestrial contact in permanent if enigmatic form, but it's full significance eludes me. Many years later, my charged hand at work became interested in the stone and photographed it from a different angle. When his brother saw the pictures he said quite unprompted, it looks like a flying saucer hovering over a hill. Indeed it did. And there was even a rising sun and an energy beam from source at a hill. So did the engraving have two meanings? At the end of 1967, I met my pen friend, Doris, who I had been writing to for three years. We fell in love, and we're engaged on November the first eight days later from a bus in her hometown of Blackburn, Doris Sora silvery UFO. We were married in 1970 and had three children. Although thought communication continued, the next overt extraterrestrial encounter was in 1986, at the time of another encounter, that of Yato spaceprobe with Halley's comet, I had just restarted the star fellowship, though getting interest aroused was difficult. And when I heard that live pictures were to be transmitted from Sri Yato. as it passed through the comets head, I attempted to send a request that some form of communication would be sent to me via the probe. I seemed to be told that if this was done, it would have to be something unrecognizable to the scientists involved. I bought a blank videotape, and as soon as the program started, set the recorder running. Most of the pictures were disappointing to me, for although they were wonderful feats of technology, there was no sign of any message. Then, just as Yato approached the closest point to the nucleus, the picture began to falter, as apparently a rocket struck the probe swinging its aerial out of line with the earth. But this last blurred picture seemed to show a pattern of white dots. I freeze frame the picture and sketched it on a piece of paper. It seemed to be just a random pattern with nothing intelligible that I could see. Then I had an impulse to turn the paper upside down. Immediately, there was a rough outline of the letters. Why, ah, the phone netic initials of yahveh, who Sita the space greeting received by Tony Wade, it was nothing provable, I could never with certainty say it was not a coincidental interference pattern, but it did seem like a final seal of approval for my ideas on thought communication and my faith in it over the years. The final occurrence was a sighting which happened over Christmas 1986 during a visit to Doris his relations in Blackpool. Standing outside the flat where we were staying after dark, Doris noticed to star like object wheeling and turning about in a very bird like motion, as if birds were reflecting the light. However, seagulls are not nocturnal, and bats are not white, and the motion was more like birds than that. Also the light from them did not seem to vary. Also, nothing like them was seen subsequently. The sighting lasted several minutes, and we left the scene before the object vanished. Tourists assumed they were birds. We were looking in the direction of the sea, not visible from the street at an oblique angle.

Isn't that fantastic? I mean, that is matchless piece of prose. Back to me now I'm afraid and here's a bedtime story for children. It was once believed that children frightened by thunderstorms could be emboldened by the application of a tincture of pauper's drool to their infant forehead. When I say it was once believed, I mean to be very specific. This was once believed by one person for a brief period of time. The person was principal Geneseo, the so called prancing Prince, who one autumn day found his daughter, the Infanta Gertrude carrying behind an heiress in her playroom. One rarely finds an heiress these days anywhere except upon the dramatic stage, but the prancing prince had thespian inclinations and his palace was littered with theatrical props. Why for art of our caring so behind the error says thunderclaps render the sky Asked the prince. In reply, the Infanta Gertrude whimpered in terror as a fresh thunderclap of rent the sky. Her playroom was on the top most floor of the palace and its ceiling had been removed, exposing the room to the mighty firmament overhead. The prince wanted to toughen his daughter up in preparation for a life of ruthless tyranny, and it dismayed him to see her milk SOP ways that it was that he strode off into the weird woods of wubi who be who to consult with the wise woman. He found her oblivious of the storm tossing fallen and gathered crab apples to her team of pigs. The wise woman was a shapeshifter. And on this particular day, she could have been mistaken for Nova Pilbeam, that siren of the British screen who in the 1930s starting Alfred Hitchcock's young and innocent and the first version of the man who knew too much. The prince explained his predicament, the wise woman, more intent upon her pigs than upon this strutting royal get made up some blather about porpoise drool off the top of her head. Prince Fulgencio listened carefully scribbled some notes down with a bio in his Filofax remarked upon the wise woman's resemblance to lab Pilbeam paid her with a pregnant pig he had found wandering disconsolate in the weird woods and pranced princely and preening back to the palace. There he come on this is loathsome servants odo and Udo to scour the countryside collecting drawn from paupers in the teeth of the still raging storm, they did so returning many hours later, with two brimming iron pails, the prince took the pails and swept into the kitchen down in the basement of the palace, and called for old Mr. Blunkett his cook to prepare a tincture from the porpoise drool just as the wise woman had prescribed. lightning flashed and thunder roared up in the playroom still cowering behind the Eris, the Infanta, Gertrude was startled to receive a message on her metal Tapping Machine. It was from Professor Cygnus mungo, the wild haired wild eyed boffin, who had been banished from the Princeton a year before, and it was now based at an important research facility far far away. The professor suggested to Gertrude that she'd get her laptop and look up his website, where she would find an SAE subtitled porpoise draw a quack potion, and no substitute for rational explanation when emboldening tiny ones terrified by electrical storms. Twilight descended with no let up in the ferocious Tempest. The prince pranced into the playroom bearing a tray on which was set a brightly gleaming goblet containing a tincture of porpoise drool next to which lay some scraps of bandage pressed into services pads with which to dab the tincture onto the forehead of the terrified quaking Infanta behind the heiress. Yet she was gone. At midnight, the prince found his daughter last. She was skipping, laughing, gambling and giggling in the open fields behind the palace as thunderbolts crashed and lightning raked the heavens. And so, never again did the Infanta Gertrude cower behind an heiress during a thunderstorm. Never again Well, odo and Udo sent off with their iron pails to collect the drool of paupers. And never again did the prince believe a word he heard

from the wise woman of the weird woods of wubi who be who, who was in any case, too busy with her team of pigs to twitch the promising Prince from the crumbling Palace in the faraway land of God.

People in large crumbling palaces now seems to be a theme. This is about the pipistrelle per sweetland the pipistrelle per Sweden is a heraldic bad usually golden and black but sometimes red. It appears on shields flags and banners visible when the banners are unfilled, but hidden when they are filled. In its fold state. The bat is known as a clandestine pipistrelle pr sweetland You will have seen this decorative bat if you have ever visited the bleak and crumbling stately home you pass if you're cycling between pointy town and hooligans Wharf. It is easy to miss it, as the house is set in vast, overgrown grounds, and the grounds are ringed by Titanic cedars which have gone on pruned for a generation. No pruning, nor any sort of gardening activity whatsoever has taken place at Plunkett Hall, since it fell into the hands of Ted darky van dongle Brack, the half Japanese half Dutch kleptomaniac stamp collector, who bought it for a token Schilling in 1966 fandangle Brack chanced upon a mezzotint of the pipistrelle persuasion in a shabby gift shopping Oh, hula hands Wharf, where it was used as scrap paper to wrap up a Google that took his fancy in the unheated rumpus room of the stately home, the philatelist, accompanied by his lanky companion roll, examined his purchase. What do you think of my new Google Raul? asked van dongle BRAC. Roll was a man of exquisite aesthetic sensibilities, which first became evident when at the age of six, he fell into a neurasthenic swoon while listening to the first Baldwin pig album. A huge dosage of Baxter's revivifying brain salt was required to study his nerves once he regained consciousness, but thereafter, Rao was treated as a flawless arbiters of taste. Thus, to darky van dongle Brack reacted to his pals judgment with punk teleo. The Google is a worthless piece of trash pronounced the frail beanpole, but the paper in which it is wrapped is gorgeous, so much so that a mere glance at the mezzotint of the heraldic bat and I feel my nerves juddering, as if I may swoon at any moment. Instantly, Van dongle BRAC smashed the Google into a million pieces with a big fat hammer, and resolved a blaze and copies of the pipistrelle purse we've learned from every cranny of his domain. And so it came to pass. Rao, of course, confronted wherever he looked with the image of the super bat was in a constant state of elevated fragility, regularly wolfing down bowls of mashed potatoes to try to keep his strength up. But inevitably, he faded away, a puny weakling confined his bed. While van dongle BRAC paste the corridors of his magnificent home, biting his fingernails and tootling dodges on his Piccolo. Hold that image in your head, dear listener, for which we'll return to it at a later date.

That's the end of holding out for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. I'd like to just end with a very brief quote. I have read this on the air before but it's so great. I think I'd love to read it again. It's a quotation from reading made easy for foreigners by john L. Well, SOF, which I think was published at some point in the 1930s. And it's this. He who begins with crutches will generally end with crutches. The world is full of human lobsters goodbye
