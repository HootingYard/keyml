Oh yes, Hello, this is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air 6:30pm suddenly somehow crept up on me, without me realizing. Yes, so anyway, here's this week show. One of the more intractable problems in Goblin identification has that last been resolved with the formal adoption of a color coding system. According to a press release from the World Council of goblins, the new scheme comes into immediate effect, and any Goblin discovered not to be wearing a tunic badge or dye patch of the appropriate color will be catapulted into the stratosphere daddio designed to benefit both the Goblin and non Goblin communities. The color coding is the result of decades of tireless work by BAM and bam and Nat, the trio of retired blacksmiths who set themselves the task back at the 1954 gi knack conference. So much time has passed, that neither Ben nor bamm nor Matt, nor any of their special rapporteurs, nor aides to camp can remember what gainax stands for. It is thought Julian Assange got hold of a draft copy of the press release some months ago, but failed to leak it on his website. If so, this is possibly because the creepy antipathy and cancer is actually a goblin himself, and fears the implications of the new system. Alternatively, it could be because the press release is in the form of Tolkien the runes scratched on bark, making it worse than useless in the age of digital twittering. Ben and ban and Nat hit on the inspired idea to match each of the seven distinct types of active Goblin to a color of the rainbow. This is surprising when one considers that both Ben and Nat are colorblind, and bam is so aged and creaky and stooped that he can no longer angle his head to look upon the sky. In spite of these obstacles, the three some have arrived at a classification system, which can only be described as flawless. It cannot be described in any other way whatsoever, so don't even try to use another word. Here at hooting yard, we employed a team of unpaid interns to translate the runes, locking the scallywags in a cellar lit by a single taco lamp until their work was done. Then we had them deported to a remote at all to live on barnacles and rainwater from motives of simple cruelty. Anyway, this is what they came up with. Red hobgoblins orange, fat goblins. Yellow, pilfering goblins green. Teutonic forest goblins, blue goblins found under sinks, indigo, wet goblins, violent, all other goblins not classified above. We cannot swear to the accuracy of the internal translation. But for the time being that we'll have to do after that peace appeared on the hooting yard website. which as you know is that hooting yd.org and I received a letter from Tim thurn. Oh glorious, Mr. Key he wrote, I don't know whether he's being obsequious or sarcastic. It's hard to tell. Anyway, he continued. It was fascinating to read about the retired blacksmith beam and Bama Nat. And I was wondering if you had any further information about them?

Well, I don't Tim, but I know a man who does, as they say, for no less a blockbuster wrist than pebble head has recently published a thumping great triple biography, entitled retired blacksmiths The True Story of BAM and bam and Nat, and a cracking good reads it is. In fact, it was my source for that business about the Goblin color coding, a full account of which appears in chapter 38. And then again almost word for word in chapter 94. One could be forgiven for thinking that one could be forgiven for thinking that pebble had completely forgot what he'd written earlier. It would not be the first time whole swathes of his potted history of jagged hair recipes. jogged are repeated more than once in the book, having already appeared in earlier volumes in the pebble head, Irv Weiner history of drugs and the other an encyclopedia of hairs. This is why he's dismissed as a hack. Hack or no, you or I would sell our grandmother's bones to achieve his sales figures. Retired blacksmith has only been in the shops for a week and has already sold more copies than there are visible stars in the sky. And deservedly so, for in spite of the fact that his prose is repetitive and slapdash and descends at times into mawkish Enos, pebble head rings from his subject, a tale worth the telling. We learned for example, about the lives of the three son before their retirement. There is been at the random Grimm forge fettling for a great grade dry horse is brightened battering sandal, and there is bam, also at a random grim Ford, also fangirling and Nat to the next forge along the lane and he to freckling as the sun beats down on a rustic seem redolent of Lark rise to candleford pebble head gives us so much detail about random grim forgeries and the fettling of Brighton battering sandals for great grade dry horses that the reader could with confidence, given an an villain a few tools set up their own Smithies. I did before I'd even finished reading the book. clang, clang, clang, that was the sound clanging from my chalet as sparks flew, and a line of great great dry horses formed outside of waiting there Brighton battering sandals. My neighbors were a great help filling those bags with hay for the horses, combing their manes, and brushing their fetlocks with horse brushes. so busy was I fickling, and smithing that I did not have any time to finish reading pebble heads book, though my places marked, I marked it, not with a standard bookmark of flimsy cardboard, but with a great iron slab beaten flat upon my enville Brighton battering. So I have not yet read beyond the point where newly retired, bam and bam and natto co opted onto the World Council of goblins and set to work on their color coding scheme. a scan of the contents page, however, suggests that there are thrills and stills are plenty still to come, including bins involvement in the Profumo affair, Ban taking a dip in the Bosphorus and not choking on a mouthful of genetically modified spinach. When I have finished battling all those great great dry horses lined up along the line, waiting patiently, patiently, I shall return to the book and tell you what more I learn about the three retired blacksmiths their doings, their dreams, their pangs and then doted,

dotage. I mentioned their larkrise to candleford and exciting news from the BBC. Verna Hertzog has been persuaded to direct a forthcoming episode of the tweet bucolic period drama. This follows the unprecedented global excess of that scene where the peasant sprawled in the drainage ditch recites Captain Beefheart old fart at play. You may remember ran summertime last year we played that here at hooting yard, and you can still hear it if you go to the hooting odd website where you can hear the old the peasant mentioning the the old fart inside was now breathing freely from his perfume bottle atomizer error bulb invention, and so on. Anyway, very Verner. Hertzog is currently working on the screenplay phase episode of larkrise to candleford which is likely to feature either a Conquistador and a gang of howler monkeys laying waste to door cast lanes candle for post office and or an attempt by a deranged impresario to build an opera house in the squalid village of larkrise. And onwards now, it's that time of year when hooting yard reader and or listener Mike Jennings from his exile in a pompous land supplies us with an update to his comprehensive Dobson bibliography. Last January, Mike Jennings provided and we printed on the published on the website, a list of 104 Dobson pamphlet, each given a botsman number, terrifying and terrifyingly significant botsman number and a further 24 pamphlets have been added, making a total of 128 so I'll give you numbers 105 to 128. These unless otherwise stated, all of the titles are out of print. 105 Ivan Clank the bailiff Oh is he dead then? 106 pancakes food of the gods with a question mark 107. Pancakes food of the gods. Without a question mark 108 my pancake ineptitude. A heart rending confession in 16 bursts of hallucinatory prose. 109 hell, it's bells 110 my terrifying encounter with a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog 111 every lace has its own boot. 112 50 pages of prose about daytime naps in theory and practice. 113 the hidden wealth of werewolves 114 the mythical island where werewolves think they come from? Why 115 a pedestrian memoir of hiking holidays accompanied by noted door best rx daube 116 1000 breakfast in 500 days 117 flight patterns of the common Shrike with a tremendously accurate diagram by marigold to 118 this year's summer reading 119 chuckles some fripperies from the bowels of hell 120 the poultry yards of the Grand dodge Kooks 121 tantalizing paragraphs about the world over the future. 122 the significance in my long ago infancy of an undyed jestin vole 123 a comparative study of the metabolisms of the horses of three Knights of the realm 124 an entirely new system of moss drainage incorporating flexible lever and lead pipes, a plastic funnel and a Dobson jar

125 a detailed account of how I provided emergency medical assistance despite not having not a lot of training to a flying squirrel exhausted and maimed after being pursued and attacked by a small tough guide Japanese macaque monkey which mistook it for a predatory bird with several diagrams and an afterword quoting a Jethro Tull song lyric 126 picnics of disillusionment 127. The history theory and practice of jiggery pokery from ancient times up to yesterday morning with practical tips and cut out and keep cardboard display models feel mantlepiece. And 128 popular games and pastimes suitable for those marooned on remote atolls pending rescue by a ship of fools.

So anyway, that takes us up to up to date full bibliography of Dobson pamphlet, the following anecdote regarding Dobson doesn't mention any new pamphlets at all unfortunately. Sometimes, they rarely, Dobson's heart would swell with a charitable impulse, and on one such occasion, he hatched the plan of inventing a novelty sandwich paste the profit from sales of which he would donate to his local otter sanctuary. I shall call it otter sanctuary sandwich paste, he explained to marigold to the better to fix in the minds of my customers, the eventual destination of their pennies. It is a capital idea, Dobson replied marigold true, but it has a fatal flaw. Dobson's face soured. Oh, and what might that be? he asked. We do not have a local otter sanctuary said marigold true. And she tossed a pebble off the bridge cross which they were plowing into the tumultuous river below. Later, back at home, the out of print pamphleteer racked his brains for a way to salvage his scheme for the charitable impulse was still throbbing after a prolonged bout of pencil sharpening, which we found conducive to concentrated thought. Dobson made a Eureka ish grunting noise and ran out into the garden where marigold two was busy with a pair of pruning shears. Who says the auto sanctuary need be a local one, he cried, I can divert the profit to a remote auto sanctuary. all well and good, said his inner mahratta but consider something else Dobson. Is there not a danger that your potential customers auto lovers every man jack of them might construe that a paste called otter sanctuary sandwich paste is actually made out of pulverized otters. Even if they're wrong, I suspect sales would suffer simply due to the misunderstanding. Dobson recruited indoors and sharpened dozens more pencils. An hour later he was back in the garden. Each tub of auto sankri sandwich paste would bear a label a bold and bright label on which would be emblazoned the slogan does not contain otters that would set the auto lovers minds at rest, would it not? It would said marigold to snipping a sprig from a shrub. But what ingredients would your sandwich paste to contain if it is to be as you suggested while we were plowing across the bridge earlier, a novelty sandwich paste. Don't worry about that said Dobson airily. I will think of something. Dobson now had two immediate tasks to accomplish, which we can summarize for the slow witted listener as follows. One to identify a remote auto sanctuary deserving of the out of print pamphleteers allows us to to concoct a novelty sandwich paste the recipe for which must contain Not a trace of otter, nor of the byproducts of otters. To facilitate his thinking on these critical matters, Dobson would need to sharpen a goodly number of pencils yet every pencil in the house have been sharpened to its utmost pointedness. As a result of which the blades of the Dobson two pencil sharpener were blunted, and needed either to be honed upon a wet stone, or elles replaced with new blades. Thus, in addition to the tax tasks enumerated above the pamphleteer faced to further challenges, there's one to obtain a fresh batch of pencils to a to have sharpened the existing blades of the pencil sharpener, or to be to replace the blades with brand new ones, gleaming and lethal. a moment's thought was all Dobson needed to realize that he could accomplish both these aims by paying a visit to the stationery department, who Berman's in spite of the fact that it was pouring buckets of rain. He donned his Belgian railway official with boots, lacing them so tightly, he was in danger of cutting off the blood supply below his ankles, and clattered out of the house into the downpour.

One thing it's important for the listener to understand about Dobson is that in spite of his bookish erudition, he was a man profoundly ignorant of the natural world. His weightlessness in ornithological matters is well attested. But did you know that if you were to line up for him, as at an identity parade, an otter and a stoat and a weasel and a vowel, and a shrew Dobson would have a deal of difficulty telling you which was which he'd never paid proper attention to his small mammal lessons at school, and forever after in life was lumbered with bafflement about such creatures. Knowing this, we can grasp an understanding of what happened next. trudging along the towpath of the filthy old canal on his way to humans in the rain. Dobson was set upon by a trio of savage and starving small mammals. roused by the smell of his Belgian railway official boots. They had, you see recently been smeared with a protective coat of some sort of dubbin substitute by a wizard and scrofulous peddler who came knocking at Dobson's door, Hawking his wares. Whatever this substance was, and however well or ill, it protected the boots. It was absolutely irresistible to certain small mammals. That it was that in their frenzy about Dobson's feet, his tiny attackers caused the pamphleteer to lose his balance, and he toppled over the edge of the towpath into the canal. The rain had reduced to a drizzle by the time Dobson sopping wet and with bits of canal water vegetations sticking out of his Buffon came crashing through the door and slumped in a chair. marigold coo gave him a quitting Look, he told her of his mishap. That remote auto sanctuary won't get a penny for my sandwich, paste, shouted Dobson. In fact, to be on the safe side, I'm not even gonna make any sandwich paste that will show them but was it a trio of otters that attacked your boots? Or could it perhaps have been stoats or weasels or voles or shrews asked marigold to incapable of a sensible response. Dobson fell into a sulk a few miles away on the outskirts of another town, or wisdom than scrofulous peddler, Hawking his wares knocked upon another door. In his Punnett he had jars and jars of paste for sale. Each was labeled, but the labels were hard to decipher. In one light, they read dubbin substitute, but then seen from a different angle, novelty sandwich paste. The peddler was dressed all in green, and when he spoke, the tambour of his voice cast the spooky spell, as if he were a figure from a fairy tale.

Finally, this week, some verse I know that listeners are wise enjoy the verse. And before I go, just a reminder As if you needed one to visit the hooting yard website, hooting yard.org you can read everything you hear on the program. You can buy books, you can make a donation, you can take out a subscription, and so on and so forth. And I better read this before the end of the show. This is called Old baleful pig. Oh, baleful pig, with your look of reproach. You fill me with feelings of guilt. And so I've embroidered the image of you upon my tattered quilt. Yes, it is tattered. Yes, it is torn, and my sewing is shoddy and frayed. You look more like a more hen, or even a goat boy, disporting himself in a Glade I spread out the quilt for my kinsfolk to see and they mocked my hamfisted cross stitch and Mab bundled it up and carried it off and tossed it into a ditch. So you're in perfect image lies soaked in a puddle, or baleful, baleful pig. And I blame myself in my cack handed ways. And I saw as I light up a cig and I puff on my SIG at the edge of the ditch. And remember your low more than two grunting when you stood on your planes that the champion pig fare needs a string of shabby old bunting. I sewed that too. And it showed it was tatty and filthy and stained and made out of rags when I was a convict, and should have been using my needle in selling up mail bags. They let me out in time to see you win the prize you hated winning. And now within my head I hear relentless dinning dinning. The dinning of the rain pour down on my pig picture sewn from thread. Oh, badly so nine no with cotton so really and blue and red. A blue red pig, or is it a goat boy or a more side bird? they mock. Your heart was weak. When they made you the champ it cracked and you died of shock. Oh, baleful pig, our IP. I buried you under the Joshua Tree.

There's a thought to take with you at the end of this week show. I hope you've enjoyed it and found it an educative experience. Use a pen and pencil and paper to make any notes you need to make. And that's it. I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
