This is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I'm going to begin this week with a song. As usual, I will just read it because if I make an attempt to sing it, I'll probably frighten any tinies or puppies that may be listening. Although I have it on good authority that someone somewhere is setting this to music, so maybe in a future show I'll be able to play the musical version. Anyway. Here is the song. The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled. He was Microsoft phallic, he had a tiny head. his hat was made of flowers, and his coat was made of lead. He fixed his gaze upon the sea, and this is what he said. I am a tiny headed boy, alone upon the ocean. My head was of an average size until I drank a potion. I drank it from a pot I found on a shelf upon the poop. A potion recommended on Gwyneth Paltrow, website, goop. The ingredients are rain and hail and did you and melted snow heated on the burning poop deck till they are a glow? when it's hot, you gulp it down and say a little prayer. Oh, burning ship. Oh boundaryless ce, O solids, liquids, air. And soon enough, you find your head will shrink until it's tiny, and you stand upon the burning deck and sail across the briny. The boy stood on the ship in flames and resolved to say no more. He stared across the sea until he came inside of shore. And like the potion he had gulped his spirits were now a glow ahead of him lay the coast of the land of Gwyneth Paltrow.

I thoroughly recommend you visit Gwyneth Paltrow, website goop for all your lifestyle advice needs. Here is a newspaper cutting, which was quoted in deadly encounters to Victorian sensations by Richard the old tick and the newspaper cutting is from the illustrated like the sorry, the illustrated times for the 10th of August 1861. So exactly 150 years ago, I think, is that right? Something like that. Anyway, here is the quotation from the newspaper. That some unusual endemic excitement has been at work directing week debauch and disease minds into a homicidal course, must be apparent to every newspaper reader may not the electrical condition of the atmosphere, exercise some hidden power in this way over the human brain. A correspondent of the standard Dr. j. q. rumball. A well known lecture on science points out electrical causes as the origin of the potato disorder. It is a fact that lately, the finest mechanisms of clockwork notably those at the observatory at Greenwich have been going wrong without visible derangement or imperfection. And this has been attributed to an abnormal condition of atmospheric electricity. It is surely not a wildly hazardous theory to suppose that Other agency acting upon that most susceptible and complex of galvanic machines, the human brain may have some tendency, if not to the actual increase of crime of lessening the healthy power which restrains it committal or have aggravating the freeness disease, which, but for such influence might have been subdued, or at least retarded. Trevor zondo culpa, but trebizond Oh Cal pepper snorted. His was a mighty snot caused on this occasion by his reading in the standard of the well known science lecturer, Dr. Jq rumbles theory that the origin of the potato disorder was of an electrical nature trebizond Oh Cal pepper gathered about him a boughs of acolytes keen young trebizond Oh, Cole pepper wrists with bright eyes and intriguingly windswept hairstyles. Hark boomed trebizond bo Culpepper, waving the newspaper aloft, rumble is spouting forth his electrical theory of the origin of the potato disorder. Never has it been clear to me that it is wholly and utterly a matter of gas. fan out now youngsters fan out and spread the word. And so the trebizond local pepper wrists, went each to his own cubicle and took up his stylus and scraped on flat sheets of gleaming trebizond Oh, Cole pepper right screeds to the standard and to other newspapers and magazines and journals and important institutions, discrediting rumble and his theory and making the case for a gas origin of the potato disorder. In his eerie trebizond Oh Cal pepper beamed with glee. He ground the standard under his boot, and he poked pins into our wax and dole of Dr Jq Rumble, and he unscrewed the nozzle on his canister and put the siphon to his plump, bulbous lips. And he took a deep, deep draft of the gas. And when he exhaled, all about him shriveled and withered and died, he clapped his hands and called to an acolyte to bring him a platter of newly disordered potatoes.

Oh, father, duggleby Did you hear about your horse? It went a clopping all alone upon the awful cliffs. It is a dreadful thing. Indeed, when a priest's horse plummet into the sea. You want to have tied it to a post. See there is a post there outside the church repository, a spout post, and it even has a rope attached. You neglected the safety of your horse and your status as a priest will not protect you from the wrath of the equine Welfare Board. I am told the deputation is already on its way, galloping across the heath. And come they did for members of the board like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, terrible in their fury, Father duggleby hidden the confessional box, but they smoked him out with incendiary devices. He was tied to the post to which his own poor perished horse should have been tied, and judgment was passed on him. Father duggleby prayed that night, still tied to the post under a gibbous moon he begged the Lord his soul to save. But When morning came by, untied him from the post and bundled him into a sack, and they carried him on a cart up to the awful cliffs. banners were flying, the sun burned brilliant and golden. When the sack hit the sea, its impact made a splash, the likes of which none had seen. nor heard before. Nor did any of these simple coastal folk have the words to describe what was so anomalous, so eerie about the splash. They called it the duggleby splash and ever since on the anniversary, they have tried to recreate it by tossing the latest priest into the sea in a sack without success. And every year on the eve of the anniversary, it is said that a phantom horse is heard a clopping along the cliffs clop sounding like the clack of rosary beads. And the day after they send for a new priest, and below he comes galloping across the heath.

So send me some money by clicking on the PayPal thing on the voting yard website. You know it makes sense. And here's here's something else now. Good evening. My name is big ears. You may know me from the books about the wooden toy Nadi written by Enid Blyton in which I feature quite prominently. It should go without saying that I'm not a toy myself. I'm a brownie, also known as and risk tomtec dama boy or heinzel Mansion, depending on which part of Europe you're familiar with. In other words, I'm a sort of hub or hobgoblin that being so you may wonder what I was doing living in Toy town and hobnobbing with a wooden toy like Nadi. If you read Mrs Blyton's biographical sketches of Nadi with Drew care however, you will recall that the toadstool house in which I resided at the time was outside the town. One could say that it was in the hilly, lumpy, bumpy part of town outside of town, very similar to the location in which a half eaten corpse is found in john paises film top of the food chain 1999. Although in that case, the town was exceptional VISTA rather than toy town. As far as I know, not he never went to exceptional Vista. I've certainly never been there myself. You may wonder what our hub was doing living on the outskirts of a town of toys would not have been better spent better. would I not have been better off spending my days somewhere more suitable for one of my kind, such as a stream or a waterfall or a disused underground railway station? Well, of course I would, but I had no choice. You see, although this is Blyton never mentioned it, I was banished to the outskirts of toy town after falling foul of the poly of the spout, the hobgoblin assembly under whose jurisdiction I fell for many years now, for many centuries, the poly was well and responsibly run. But in 1922, there was a concerted effort, eventually successful by a bunch of hot headed Hobbs to stage a poly coup. These with the snappers had all come under the spell of a poet called TS Eliot, who in that year published a poem called the wasteland, though so fanatical were the coup leaders. They got hold of an earlier draft, which went by the title he do the police in different voices. It is only fair to point out that Mr. Elliott was completely unaware of this particularly fractures, hobgoblin grew past school and bought nowhere responsibility for the manner in which they twisted his words.

I myself had always been on good terms with the poly of the spout. But when the new regime began flexing its muscles, I swiftly became hobgoblin non grata. It was decreed that my ears were too big a preposterous charge, but one I had not the resources to rebut. The stripes of my trousers were subject to criticism. My cap was said to be either too pointy or not pointy enough. And the last straw came when Lil's husband got de mobbed, and the wind cross the brown land and heard and the nymphs departed. And at my back and a cold blast I heard the rattle of the bones and the sound of horns and motors and burning, burning, burning and the agony in stony places, the shouting and the crying, prison and palace and reverberation of thunder of spring over distant mountains, and other withered stumps of time were told upon the walls. I was brought before a special session of the parleys star chamber. What do you have to say for yourself big ears? They snapped. I said, I swear I can't bear to look at you and no more can't I? I said. This did not go down well, and after a horrible hobgoblin screeching of twit twit twit jug jug jug jug jug jug so rudely forced, I was shoved into a sealed compartment on a train like the psychopathic mass murderer Lenin on his way to the Finland station. But in my case, my ears were deemed too big, and I was heading across Madden more land for the station at the edge of the enchanted wood, just outside of toy town, and banished brownie. A brownie banished spent seven long years in my total house before taking the wooden toy naughty under my wing. Some say I should have spent my time plotting against the Polly of the spout. I once asked Mrs. Blyton her opinion of the matter, but she was too busy typing her food laid out in tins. out of the window pair of perilously spread her drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays on the divan piled stockings, slippers, camisoles and stays. She was so distracted she mistook me for Thai receipts, an old man with wrinkled dogs. I'd like to thank you for inviting me to talk to you this evening. I'm sure we can yet topple the regime. If we strive together with vim, gusto and our improbably enormous is

on top of the hill, hidden behind the line of pines, stands the old rugged cross, to the foot of which is tethered a wolf, which when night comes down and the stars come out, begins to how and howls until the dawn. As dawn breaks up the slope of the hill toils the village Wolf Man with his bucket of slaughtered squirrels and hamsters and mice food for the wolf. He empties the bucket at the foot of the old rugged cross. And while the wolf gobbles down its breakfast, he strides in his wolf man's boots to the real and dips the bucket in collecting water for the wolf. When the wolf has eaten it's fill and slurped up all the water it wants from the bucket. Back down the hill goes the Wolf Man, having first given a few tugs to the tether to test its strength. In the village tavern, the Wolf Man reports to the villagers on the strength of the tether and the health of the wolf. And the old rugged cross, asks a villager hangs Christ upon it still. He does, replies the wolf man lying through his teeth, and he takes up his pot of hooch and drains it and back The empty pot upon the tavern table. up on the hill, the wolf sleeps in the shadow of the old rugged cross, upon which hangs not Christ, but the carcass of a demon beset by midges blue bottles and flies.

In the dying hours of the Year in a foul and Ill lit alleyway, or rattled rule a staggering out of a dental device was set upon by a rough Ian the Rafi and before the rule a upon the bonds and kicked him on the shins just above his Spats and thumped him in the stomach and the room a crumpled to the ground, winded and helpless in the noise, some filth then the Rafi and stamped his big black boots upon the ruins, biffed bonds and spat upon his person and stalked off down the alleyway into the night. And soon thereafter, came the peeling of bells ringing in the new year, and from a clump of dark trees in the park, the hooting of an owl that's the opening paragraph of pebble heads, paperback potboiler, the Rafi and befoe his book, surely the most relentlessly violent novel ever published. It's 400 pages consist of little more than descriptions of the Rafi and befoe briefing and kicking and punching and thumping a series of victims from the rattle rule a staggering from a den of advice to a preening flop on a Royster oyster, a dandy in the doorway of a bordello a macaroni on horseback and I pantaloon Magnifico on his way to Balogh and mashella. interspersed with these almost identical scenes, pebble head makes a few half witted attempts to probe the interior life of his Rafi and lead protagonist. befoe, we are told is variously a card carrying communist, devoted to his dear old mum and a wizard at the loom. To be fair, there is one lengthy and anomalous passage, pages 103 to 149 were befo weaves a blanket for his mother, a blanket emblazoned with a hammer and sickle, and a daringly avant garde portrayed of Stalin. In an interview, pebble had did not claim as one might have expected him to that this scene, beautifully written and astonishing in its detail of both blanket weaving and communist ideology is the heart of the novel. In fact, he was quite shameless in his assist insistence that before those briefings and kicking and punching and somethings and what the book is about, adding that he only threw in the other material, because he had a head cold and drank too many beakers of a Lemsip. It's difficult to know what to make of the book but like all pebble heads, paperback, potboilers, it's a best seller. Apparently, he plans to follow it up with a spin off about the rattle rule a following his debauchery is in the weeks leading up to the fateful encounter with befo. I am hoping announced the writer from his Shall I Oh pros, that the next book will prove to be the most relentlessly debauch novel ever published. After that, I shall move on to a more kishin vapid heist, an espionage romantic science fiction teenage detective blockbuster with vampires.

I'd like to give you a recipe for Syriac Syriac was created by the ancient Greeks and achieved a miraculous reputation as a universal panacea. It's the kind of thing you might find on goop the website of Gwyneth Paltrow. It was believed to be effective against swellings, blemishes, fevers, poisons, heart problems, epilepsy and palsy. And it restored lost speech after a stroke. So Syriac, also known as Venetian treacle took 40 days to make 12 years to mature and contain up to 64 ingredients. And if you've got pen and paper, you may wish to make a list of the most important ones opium myrrh frankincense, Saffron gente in licorice, cinnamon, gum arabic Bhikkhu men and skinned and roasted Vipers.

If you have any comments to make, you can always send them to me at hooting yard.org or something no hooting yard.com I think and or go to the website, blah blah blah.
