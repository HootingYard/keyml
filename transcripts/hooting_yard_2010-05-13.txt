This is indeed resonance 104 point four FM or possibly www dot resonance fm.com depending on how you're listening, and here we are live in the gleaming on the 200 and 67th floor of the gleaming skyscraper which houses the entire resonance operation. This is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key I should get round to introducing the show should not. Last week I left you in suspense. Because of bad timing, I was unable to complete the suspenseful tale of Dobson and his terrifying encounter with a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog. And I've decided rather than just continuing with it to read the whole thing. By starting the show, I'll be able to finish it this time. If you have any complaints about me reading the same thing more than once. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. So here we go. reading an item in The Guardian the other day about tiny lethal phantasmal poison frogs. Others reminded of Dobson's pamphlet, my terrifying encounter with a tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog out of print. It is by any measure one of his most exciting works guaranteed to have one panting for breath and to cause beads of sweat to break out upon the brow. This is Drew to the pamphleteer deploying, as he so rarely did his remarkable ability for building suspense. alerted by the title, we're in a state of heightened expectation for the appearance of the miniscule killer, so tiny yet so toxic, but Dobson is in no hurry to come face to face with the lethal frog. He begins by recounting in exasperating detail how in preparing for a morning trudge along the towpath of the old canal. He discovered that the aglets on his batavian crime busters boots had become rusted and brittle. The boot laces fraying as a result, reluctant to Don a different pair of boots for reasons he enumerates over five pages. Dobson describes his search in drawers and cupboards and hidey holes for a replacement pair of boot laces throughout this desperate fossicking as he calls it, marigold Chu is staring out of the window at the incessant rainfall, picking out a tune on her Celeste, composing in her head the words of the song that would later be known as The Ballad of incessant rainfall. In his monograph on Dobson's various items of footwear, Aloysius nesting bird asks why the pamphleteer did not simply remove the laces from one of his other pairs of boots and reuse them when it became obvious that he had no pristine boot laces to hand. He answers his own question. By delving into Dobson's infamous pamphlet, every lace has its own boot, out of print, the work which pallimed in excruciating detail the unfathomable depths of the pamphleteers neurosis in these matters. Those of us who've read our nesting bird will have his commentary in the back of our minds. As we follow Dobson crashing about the house on his few tiles search 20 pages in we're no closer to our own encounter with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, but the tension is becoming unbearable. At the point where Dobson describes tipping out onto the floor, the contents of a battered cardboard box kept under the kitchen sink. We are ready to put the pamphlet aside and to put the kettle on for a common cup of tea. Next, we take a nap and when we return to the pamphlet, we find that this is what Dobson did to giving up hope of finding new boot laces for his batavian crime busters boots and leaving marigold to clinking and musing and staring out of the window. The pamphleteer retires to his Nat pub. Now he cranks up the suspense by treating the reader to a detailed account of his period of unconsciousness, accompanied by masterly if somewhat florid descriptions of his pillows, his coverlet and his mattress,

nesting bird has remarked that no one has ever written about the nap as brilliantly as Dobson. The only wonder is that he never devoted an entire pamphlet to the subject. This is uncharacteristically careless of nesting bird, who was overlooked the mid period pamphlet 50 pages of prose about daytime naps in theory and practice, out of print. It is an inexplicable lapse on the part of the greatest of Dobson this one I am minded to attribute to his habit in later years of mulch and mop cloth, Bish Bosh floppy flapping. And so we're put on tenterhooks still awaiting the terrifying encounter with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog. Wondering if perhaps when Dobson wakes from his nap, it will be to find the diminutive assassin perched within his Buffon. But no, he wakes, he grunts, he stumbled, stays escript while and begins scribbling. What we now come upon is not the fatal frog, but one of the central mysteries of Dobson is scholarship. This is what the pamphleteer tells us. I woke, I granted, I stumbled to my escrow swab and thereupon scribbled 10 pages of mighty prose, putting the finishing touches to my pamphlet, six more lectures on fruit. The puzzle is that no such pamphlet exists. Given the importance within the canon of the original six lectures on fruit out of print, it seems barely credible Dobson could have completed a sequel, only to destroy it so utterly, that Not a trace remains. As nesting bird has demonstrated, though the pamphleteer wrote innumerable fragments and scraps and unfinished doodles. Whenever he considered a work complete, he invariably published it, including the stuff that can only be described as bollocks. That is nesting birds word, not mine. There is no other reference anywhere to this pamphlet, and in fact, marigold crew, in a late interview, directly denied its existence. Everything Dobson had to say about fruit, she said into a tape recorder is contained in the six rector's the very idea that any further essays could have been wrung out of his brain is preposterous. He simply didn't know enough about fruit. As with all marigold chews, tape recorded pronouncements. This has the ring of truth, and is backed up by the remarks of the pointy town. fruiter Cygnus Mundo fig or plum tree, who recalled that Dobson used to stand in front of his market stall fruit display, scratching his head and wearing an entirely vacant expression for hours upon end on many of market day morning, as if that were not evidence enough, we have the famous incident when the pamphleteer took part in a charity fruit quiz on the radio and failed to answer a single question correctly. My own theory about this perplexing mystery is that Dobson is deliberately pulling the wool over our eyes by claiming to have written a pamphlet for which no credible evidence exists. He guesses rightly that our bafflement will be sufficient to make us forget all about the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, at least temporarily, so causing us greater terror and alarm when he reminded us about it. A few pages later. It is an inspired display of narrative fireworks. Here is how he makes our hearts thump.

Having pocked the final full stop on my energetic fruit sequel, I decided to go a trudging along the canal towpath in the incessant downpour. After all, I determined to wear my Latvian civic cavalry boots instead of the batavian crime busters boots. For the laces in the former were I knew in tip top condition. Earlier in the week, I had run them through a pneumatic boot lace testing contraption hired from who Berman's it was worth every penny, that when the time came to return the machine to that most gorgeous of department stores. I admit I shed a few tears as I travel it along the lane atop my cart. I wondered if I would ever be able to afford to buy one of my own. Then all my bootless problems would vanish in the ether. Perhaps I thought as I rounded the sordid duck pond, if I could write a pamphlet that would outsell a pebble head paperback I might Oh, hang on, I'm forgetting myself. You will want to know about my terrifying encounter with a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog. Allah wishes nesting bird rightly numbers this as among the top 100 paragraphs ever committed to paper by the out of print pamphleteer? yes even after this Dobson continues to twist the knife. It seems the suspense could not be brought to a higher pitch, but it is. I have read the pamphlet 1000 times studied it, subjecting the text to the most absolute critical scrutiny, and even disgusted with frightening continental literary critics or horn rimmed spectacles and atrocious beards and retains and arrogant hand gestures, but still, I cannot work out how he does it. No sooner has he reminded us of the tiny toxic Pipo dough bait with which he is destined to become terrifyingly face to face. Then he postpones the awful moment by spending dozens of pages Wittering on about other types of poison dart frogs, frogs in general, toads, green things, things with legs, tiny beings, poisonous beings, radiant beings, Ecuadorian and Andean life forms, and weirdly, the Flemish painter duck boots. Now we are unable to let the imminent encounter slip from our minds. There is no relief from the tension. Dobson's ability to shoehorn duck boots into his frog nightmare is sheer genius. If the reader manages to get through all this without swooning or just dropping dead, it's a capital idea to toss the pamphlet aside and put the kettle back on. Or if there is a dog in the vicinity to take it for a walk and let it off its leash when one reaches an expansive green sward and throw a stick for it to fetch repeatedly. And then perhaps to head to a pond and take from one's pocket the paper bag of style bread crust one has brought with one and tracks across one by one into the pond as nutriment. For ducks, if there are ducks in the pond, or swans if there are swans, and unleash the dog again and allow it to leap fiscally into the pond for a swim. If the bylaws permit the swimming of dogs in the pond, then on the way home, pop into the orphanage to distribute arms, and perhaps leave the dog there to serve as the orphans pet unless the orphanage is in a designated risk of rabies zone, in which case Skippy, or practice, or whatever the dog is called, will have to be returned to wherever it was one gathered it from outside the post office perhaps, or the dog pound, and then as one skips lightly along the path towards one's door become become one we'll be both physically and mentally prepared to face the final hideous revelation of the Dobson pamphlet. The encounter so long threatened with the tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog of the title. So once safely back in the parlor thirst quenched by that nice cup of tea, one can fling oneself into one's armchair, Allah Nayland Smith in the food man, two books of sacks Roma, and in hand, no longer shaking with tear, pick up the pamphlet and read. And then as I crept from the wreckage of the airplane into an Andean slope, so incredibly high above sea level, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. It was tiny. It was a lethal. It was phantasmal it was poisonous. It was a tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog.

I was transfixed with terror, my whole body stiffened, as if I were a piece of timber. The slopes of the Andes are steep. So immediately I began to roll downhill just as a piece of timber wood as I rolled so the distance grew between me and the tiny, lethal phantasmal poison frog until I could no longer see it. By the time I came to rest at the foot of that Andean slope, I was no longer paralyzed with fear. The tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog was far far above me now, up in the thin air, and it was so tiny. I calculated that even hopping as frantically as it could, I would be long gone before it reached sea level. I stood up in Ecuador, and walked away from the mountain delivered from peril, sound of limb numb of brain, writer of pamphlets

And here's some more about Dobson. It begins with a quotation from the 1968 novel dance of the dwarf by Jeffrey household. The pilot of the government canoe which would call that Santa eulalia. On May the second 1966, reported that he was in the best of health and spirits. The government canoeist or his pilot, checked on Dobson pretty regularly while he was holed up in an Estancia 12 miles south of Santa you laelia. notes in the canoe log indicate that the pamphleteer was visited not only on May the second, but also on the fourth, sixth, seventh, and 15th. Each time he was said to be in the best of health and spirits, except on the final visit, when he was apparently cranky and cantankerous and possibly possessed by the evil spirit, which haunts the jungle. It was, of course, on May the 15th 1966. That Dobson was dragged onto the government canoe and taken up river to the capital city, where he was interrogated by Captain Vargas. But what was he doing in that remote a stanchion on the edge of the jungle for two weeks, he had neither pencil nor notepad with him. So he was certainly not working on a pamphlet. He shuns the few families who Scrabble the living in the village of Santa eulalia. And when any of them approached the stance here, he hid in one of its many cubbies, and yet he did not hide when the government canoe came by. Indeed, he was uncharacteristically welcoming, inviting the canoeist and his pilot ashore and regaling them with anecdote ej. It is a pity no record was made of the tales he told them for then we might have a better idea of his state of mind. Captain Vargas got nothing out of him, for by the time he was shoved into the interrogation room. Dobson was raving and bellowing. Vargas himself had once been the government canoeist but after an accident with a paddle in which he injured a river bird he was demoted. confined to the larger important building in the capital city's most spacious Plaza Vargas hankered for the river and the canoe and the companionship of the canoe pilot. He was hoping that if he could crack the Dobson case, he might be rewarded by being reappointed as government canoeist. After all his successor has bonked many a wading river bird on the head with his paddle deliberately, and there was talk of demoting him to Vargas heard the unofficial chatter in the canteen on the ground floor of the larger important building, as he sipped his pill Gar and stared out of the window at the spacious Plaza. Yet Dobson defied him. All Vargas could glean was that the out of print pamphleteer had shown up in Santa eulalia. On May the first in hiking gear mapless and famished he stuffed himself with pancakes, told a couple of anecdotes and carried on down the river until he reached the abandoned distancia where he stopped and stayed seemingly in the best of health and spirits for a fortnight. There were many bats at the stance here, and Vargas wondered if he had come to study them. But after a flurry of correspondence with expert, the captain concluded, Dobson knew nothing bad, or at least no more than a child would be expected to know. The whole point of the government can was that it was meant to keep tabs on foreign pamphleteers. In this instance, it had signally failed to do so. Vargas felt sure that had he still been the canoeist. His reports on Dobson would have been more forthright, he would have questioned him more closely. Rather than just suffering his anecdotal edge. He decided to go rogue to commandeer the government canoe under cover of night and to search the Estancia for clues. And he took a heavily sedated Dobson with him. It is this nocturnal river trip on the government canoe that was the subject To Dobson's remarkable pamphlet, written many moons later, in titled, all about

my nocturnal river trip and the government canoe with Captain Vargas, during which I was heavily sedated, out of print, the prose is hallucinatory And strangely stilted. It is actually quite difficult to bring any sense out of it. But close reading in the stupor of half sleep allows us to understand that Vargas took the government canoe in the wrong direction, bashed innumerable river birds on the head with his paddle, and eventually ended up in open sea having inexplicably navigated his way through the Delta. The pamphleteer and his interrogator were hoisted to safety by the government tropper and the government canoe was allowed to drift away into the vast and pitiless ocean. Vargas spent the rest of his life trying to find it. Some say he's still alive, an old and wrinkled wreck roaming the coastlines of the world. As for what Dobson got up to in those two weeks in the remoter stands here, the only clue we have is in the title of another light pamphlet. An anecdote about channeling jungle demons wearing a copper cone atop my head while hiding in a cubby full of backs out of print. Unfortunately, this is written in prose even more hallucinatory and stilted and it makes no sense whatsoever.

Assessing the career of the tyrant King capacity is the eighth, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that he was excessively dull witted and dim. There is a plethora of anecdotes from courtiers and palace leeches, revealing that the king was rarely able to answer simple questions such as what part of the body sits on top of the neck? How many angels can dance upon the head of a pin, or who won the 1953 FA Cup final. And yet this atrociously stupid man rolled over a mighty kingdom for many years, his hands steady at the helm, though his mind was do lolly. So dim as he was, he has much to teach us about the craft of kingship, and indeed of tyranny. If we consider tyranny, a craft, for Let there be no doubt that his reign was tyrannical. In the case of capacitors, the eighth wrote to the historian sagely sagely, we find a faithful combination of childish whimsy and an inability to string together a coherent sentence. Thus it was that his hench persons invariably misunderstood his use cases, but hurried to fulfill them come what may. sagely gives as an example, the occasion when the tyrant kings whim was to burn down every barn in the land, but so muddled and mangled was the manner in which he gave the command that his royal barnburner mistakenly put a pot bellied pig in charge of the palace Treasury instead, as might have been expected, the pigs spent every last golden coin on swell and not a barn was burned to the ground. Fortunately, capacitors the eighth was so dim that he did not realize what had happened, nor why, and he retired to his booth duar to gaze at his ceiling, thinking it was the vault of heaven. One could multiply such Flim Flam until the cows come home. And indeed, there are many amusing and sometimes alarming books which cobbled together hundreds of instances of kaskus the eighth imbecility I want to take a slightly different tack. However, the thing that's always fascinated me about the tyrant King is not his breathtaking dimness, but his dinner jackets. Dinner was of supreme importance at the quarter capacitors, the eighth whatever else was going on. at four o'clock sharp every day, the king would sweep into his banqueting Hall and sit down at his banqueting table at which would be gathered all sorts of banqueting companions. In spite of his dimness, the king likes to be entertained during dinner by philosophers, scientists, novelist, artists, actors travel jugglers pamphleteers scientists scrappily bearded film directors, engineers, podcast maestro's, deep sea divers, chefs, snipers, ornithologist, sundry persons with metal plates in their skulls. magicians mountain is ex beetles, priests, anthropologist cartographers, architect mesmerist, and if he was available, Rolf Harris, it is doubtful if any of the high flown Table Talk penetrated the Kings dull witted brain, but he sat there a fork in each hand. He never used a knife, beaming and resplendent in his dinner jacket of the day. There were seven of these jackets, one for each day of the week, and the king quite a dash in all of them. Monday's was made of Crimplene and cardboard, with golden stars and ribbons and a coat hanger embedded in it. Tuesday's was a plain burlap sacking adorned with coal dust and grease. Wednesday's was a gorgeous embroidered flapping wonder. Thursdays was satin boxy and black. Fridays was knit from strands of a rare and stinking wall. Shawn from rabid sheep tie dyed like some hippy shawl surrounded by an aura invisible. Saturdays was a classic cut but frayed at the cuffs with dangling bells. Sunday's was somehow a blur, as if the king was vibrating on another plane just beyond human apprehension. Whatever day of the week it was whichever dinner jacket he was wearing the tyrant King, eight sparingly, birdseed and millet mostly accompanied by sips of lukewarm water from the palace spigot. Today,

the dinner jackets can be found hanging in display cases and a jolly little museum hidden away in one of the less salubrious fo bogs of pointy town. I exhort you to pay a visit night repeated visits, study the jacket, now caked with dust, hear the echoes of all that banqueting table babbling. take away with you a souvenir packet of tyrant kings birdseed, relive the days when capacity is the eighth reign over us demand tyrannical and cutting quite a dash. The part of the body a top of the kings neck, by the way, was his head.
