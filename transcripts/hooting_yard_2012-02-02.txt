Good evening This is hooting yard on the air. With me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM. Live from London on accountably. I missed by two years, the centenary of the replacement of tin by Alan minium in the manufacturer of what we still call tin foil. as so often we have boffins in Switzerland to thank for this innovation, namely Dr. Lauber neighbor and company, who opened the world's first elementium foil rolling plant in Ms. Hoffman in 1910. For those of you and I know there are many who like to keep track of these things. And this Hoffman is in the canton of Sir Gao, or so govia in ancient times the home of the people of the Finn culture, who apparently kept large numbers of pigs. Anyway, as I say, I neglected to mention the center scenery at the time. And I know that many listeners will have been drumming their fingers in patiently for the past two years, wondering when I'm going to get round to telling you what to do with all that tin foil you've accumulated in your kitchen drawer. Well, I'm delighted to say that at long last, I can turn my attention to this splendidly versatile material. Just bear in mind that when I talk about tin foil, I mean, aluminium foil, and I'm not expecting you to try to track down a statue of the old 10 stuff, even if there's any silver available, which I suspect there is not. The best thing you can do with your tin foil is to fashion for yourself a conical tin foil hat. It's important that you make a cone shape, rather than trying to mold the tin foil into the approximate shape of say, a Homburg or a trilby, or a stovepipe hat. Though the wonder of tin foil is that all of these hat types could quite easily be made, you must stick to the cone. In part, this is in homage to Jimmy Godard and the copper cone he used for daily communication with space people. But don't jump to the conclusion that your tin foil cone hat will help you to talk to space people. It won't nor will it protect you from weird unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and beams and invisible hoo ha. If such phenomena exist, and can dislodge and jumble and even control the innards of your brain, they're hardly likely to be dissuaded by a sheet of tin foil are they? nonetheless, when forming your surplus tin foil into a hat. It is well to pay tribute to Jimmy Godard and the star fellowship. For as Jesus said, a prophet is not without honor, but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house. And he could there do no mighty work. Mark six, verses four and five. But you can do mighty work wearing your conical tin foil hat. I'm thinking specifically of amateur dramatics. Some might call that leisure rather than work. But believe you me if you put your heart and soul into it. Amateur dramatics can feel like work and mighty work that there are several parts in the repertoire where the wearing of a conical tinfoil hat is absolutely essential. Consider for example, our nahan kin in The Man Who Came to Dinner in a shiny point he had by Belper free song, it's not admittedly a very big part. And for most of x two and three, the character lies apparently dead on the floor of the parlor while all hell breaks loose around him. But just think of the applause that always greets his entrance. And that ringing line. Hello, I've come to dinner and I'm wearing a shiny, pointy conical hat. It's also worth bearing in mind that old namkeen gets to keep the hat on even after he's poisoned and stabbed and shot by the vengeful cassandre. He keeps it on throw out x two and three lying motionless on the parlor floor. And at no time is the hat snatched by one of the other characters who gets to wear it instead.

That's what happens of course in one of the other great conical tin foil hat part, the squalid mute in Pepin. stows. An inspector wearing a shiny pointy hat called the squalid mute, of course, turns out to be a police inspector, a revelation somewhat less revelator ease and Pepin stone intended, given his cack handed way of giving the game away in the plays title. But that doesn't need to concern you. You'll just need to make sure as the curtain falls at the end of each performance that you retrieve your conical tinfoil hat from the actor playing Sergeant piffle, who smashes the hat from atop the inspectors head in that riveting scene at the end of Act four, and wears it himself in a clever ploy to foil Jasper's attempt to gain knitties inheritance. It might be a creaking plot device. But whenever I've attended an amateur troops performance for the play, it's never failed to bring the house down. There are other parts in some really Tip Top dramas where the wearing of your conical tinfoil hat is not actually called for in the script, but adds a certain something to the character. You might get into arguments, or even fisticuffs with the director, if they're the type of director averse to the disporting of unnecessary conical tinfoil hat. If this is the case, the best thing to do is to say that you're under attack from weird unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and beams and invisible hoo ha, and must wear the conical tinfoil hat as protection. Most theater directors, professional or amateur will succumb to such a protest, particularly if it's voiced in a wild and high pitched screech. If you load the very idea of amateur dramatics, you can still find advantageous opportunities for the wearing of your conical tinfoil hat, promenading loitering, and hiking are all suitable activities, particularly the latter, particularly in the rain, particularly if it is torrential. There is nothing quite like the sound of the incessant pinging of water on metal as you hike in your conical tinfoil hat through a teeming downpour.

For a couple of years only in the present century, I had a mobile phone. By current standards, it was a clunky and primitive affair, on which I was able to make telephone calls, which I did send text messages, which I rarely did and play a few games, which I never did. One day the rental period expired, and I didn't immediately renew it. Nor did I investigate any shorter term or pay as you go options. I put the phone in my desk drawer where it Nestle's still gathering dust. Owning a laptop and being a constant user of what our Belgian pals call head internet. It would be both preposterous and pretentious to call myself a Latter Day Luddite. But the laptop is I think the only thing I own, which marks me as a citizen of the 21st century, discounting the unused mobile itself a 1990s model, which it's true could be routed back to life, I assume. I have nothing else that I couldn't have owned in say, 1960 I don't have a television. I don't have a microwave oven. Don't have a digital camera, or any other space age devices. This isn't a conscious pose of foolhardy attempt to be a living anachronism. For example, I'm perfectly happy to use tea bags rather than leaf tea. Though, how I miss the tea strainer as a numinous everyday object. It's simply that I find it possible to live a contented life without all this stuff. And whenever I sit on a bus and watch people jabbing at the tiny keyboards on their devices, or listen to them, jabbering away on their phones, and when I can restrain myself from throwing a pocket full of pebbles at their heads, I'm reminded that I'm better off without these things. And that one day, I'm going to take that old mobile phone out of the desk drawer and throw it in the bin, or crush it under foot, or donated to a passing mendicant but as I say, the laptop is an essential part of my life. One I'd missed much, much more than I miss tea strainers. And it's because I'm an online kind of guy, that I'm aware of such things as apps, which as far as I can gather, the multitudinous wonders available, essential for mobile phones and smartphones and iPads and tablet PCs and whatever else the digital person about town is jabbing and gazing at and jabbering into. So it seems to me only right that in this brave new world, there really ought to be a hooting yard app, even though I wouldn't use it myself. The question is, what is the name of all saints in heaven? What a hooting yard app actually do. It's occurred to me you say to employ a gaggle of unpaid interns to work tirelessly chained in a cellar fed on slop on the development of the hooting yard app. The technology of course holds no terrors for the young person's they might go up uncomprehending Lee at the sight of a tea strainer, which they've never seen before. But the creation of an app comes naturally to them as breathing. Nevertheless, in their plaintive little voices, they pop up what is it you want the Hooton yard app to do Mr. Key in it? And thus far, I have no answer ready for them. Though. In a happy moment, I did consider the possibility that my app might deliver a disabling electric shock to the user upon their each and every utterance of the barbarism any

Frank Key  12:52
having got this far, and recognizing that a world without a hooting yard app is a world not worth living in. I feel I must plow on indefatigably but the interns will grow rested when they've completed the interim project with which I've fought them off the development of the it strainer. So I'm appealing to the constituency of hooting yard listeners to drum up ideas, you will I'm sure have been sat there jabbing and gazing at and jabbering into your device. Always with that nagging thought at the back of your puny pea sized brain that however exciting and versatile and efficient and entertaining your paddle paudel dg thingamajig is its true potential has yet to be unleashed. Because what it really needs to justify its very existence, let alone its cost is to have inserted into its electronic innards the app of apps the hooting yard app. When you've worked out what it will do, let me know and I'll tell the interns by way of a note scribbled in pencil on a scrap of paper rolled up and sent through pneumatic tube down to the cellar

when that piece appeared on the hooting owl website, which I should remind you is that www dot hooting yd.org and which you're encouraged to visit One of the comments on that piece was from Glen Webster from New Zealand, who said, using the compact and intuitive crumple and shatter user interface, the hooting yard app could pack 1000 useful functions into a window the size of a map trade badger cam blog jetty and planting calendar you case notifier bomba gauge, duck pond locator he pamphlets virtual, our decoder ring, umbrella man game, etc. Or it could just quietly play the Caucasian lullaby when it detects the vowels in conversations.

Did you know that bubinski the infamous walrus mustache serial killer had an idiot half brother. This trap poo for the sake of convenience we shall call babinski to was officially classified as a type four Cretan under the official idiot classification system, or pertaining at that time in that land under that regime. I'm afraid I don't know how many numbered types of credit there were, nor of the nature a number of other idiot types. And I've only been able to ascertain bubinski twos official classification after years and years of fossicking about in moldy archives at grave peril to my physical and mental health. That's why I walk with a stick and hold what I do viewed myself a coherent conversations with birds including the linnets and partridges as a type for Cretan babinski to was considered to be a purely high functioning idiot, deemed suitable for such tasks as using a pointy stick to gather litter from verdant Parkland, mopping up filth in long corridors, sitting in a tent outside a cathedral and writing opinion pieces for The Guardian. Unfortunately, due to fuddled bureaucracy, several doctors had instead recommended that the most effective treatment for him at that time in that land under that regime was to be chained up in a cellar and fed very occasionally on slops, or if that option was not available, to be trained up in an attic, unfed very occasionally on pap. Such then, was his plight. In the dying days of the corrupt and despicable reign of the double kings, Berto, and ignatz babinski himself, walrus mustache and lumbering and psychotic, knew nothing of his idiot half brothers fight. They had been parted since they were tiny. If one can for a moment imagine a tiny babinski yet like us all, the blood drenched nutcase was once an innocent baby in arms, rocked in a cradle and sang to by his mama, though perhaps, we ought not examine too closely the words of the songs that good woman sang to him, nor indeed their tunes. If tunes they can be called, for it probable that it was those very songs or hideous Cata walls that lay the eggs of crime within his brain. She did not sing to babinski to. Their partying happened unexpectedly during a family picnic at a site of bucolic glory. When babinski was three and babinski. Two was two. There was a sudden thunderstorm, my mom was struck by lightning, a wolf carried bubinski off into the woods. His idiot half brother was left behind, drooling on the picnic blanket, deafened by jet fighters swooping low overhead, and by thunder, until he was gathered up and swaddled in the picnic blanket, and born away by a passing widow woman. Old Mother seabag. Montefiore had been reduced to penury since the death of her husband Well, Kingdom bertos insane wars, or possibly in one of King ignatz is sane ones. And she conceived the idea of selling the child at that time in that land, under that regime, they had a primitive version of eBay. So she took a snapshot of the idiot taught and posted it and waited for bids to come in. All we know now is that at least one bid must have been made for babinski to was indeed sold. To whom and for what some we know not at all trace of him is lost until he turns up some 30 or 40 your God help us 50 years later, chained up in a cellar or an attic by dint of bureaucratic fuddle

At which point, the criminal half brother babinski re enters the scene. The double kingdom is on its last legs. Um, Berto is spending more and more of his time, like Baruch Spinoza pitting spiders against each other in combat. ignatz is taken to obsessive annotation of back numbers of the Reader's Digest. Every day, entire flocks of birds are dropping dead out of the sky, and wherever one looks, the potatoes and blighted the land is descending into a state of anarchy, an ideal playground for a villain like babinski. No doubt on that fateful March morning, cavorting with the wolves in the woods, he was plotting further an ever more heinous enormities. But then word reached him via the primitive version of spam email prevalent at that time in that land under that crumbling regime that his idiot half brother babinski to was languishing chained up in a cellar or an attic, and fed very occasionally on slots or pap. And all because of a puzzlement regarding precisely which classification of Cretan type he fell into. It is important for the listener to understand that for all his derangement, and demented pneus, and blog, lasten, psychopathology and the echoes of those mad horrible maternal songs ricocheting forever inside his skull bubinski was filled with a boundless fraternal devotion to babinski to how often he had vowed, if once he could find his last half brother to class, pimped his bosom and slobber over him, and teach him all the tricks of strangulation, and slicing up and bone smashing and other such murderous techniques as he had mastered, oh, he had vowed as much at least three or four times during the long insanitary decades of bertos and ignatz his kingship so now on this windy March morning, a prize that last of his idiot half brothers plight, bubinski preened his walrus mustache, and set off for the grim, bleak vile border outpost where babinski tubes confined. On the way he killed and killed and killed again. close to the border, he stopped in a post office to ask for directions. And while he was there, he bought some postage stamps. Well, to be accurate, he didn't so much by them as steel them, having first snap the spine of the postmaster and chopped him up with an axe. Having wiped his hand clean on one of his many many rags. babinski was disconcerted to note that the heads of both um Berto and ignatz had been scratched out on the postage stamps, and in their place was a hasty potato print of quite a different head ahead which bore a distinct resemblance to babinski himself. What can this mean? He shouted in vain at the bloodied body parts strewn across the post office floor. What it meant was that only the day before the regime had finally collapsed, and Berto and ignited when helicoptered into exile on a faraway sea good at all. The revolutionary council had free babinski to from his trains at his cellar, or his attic and installed Him as their puppet leader. From that day on, for untold years, they've been ski to rule the land. idiotically chained up sprawled on innumerable soft plush cushions in the presidential palace, and fed copiously with fruit and fiber breakfast cereal, and smokers, Pop Tarts, and Ferro globing. vitamin supplements. babinski himself was never granted an audience with the puppet potentate. But he had other fish to fry and bones to break and throat to select and gorgeous spill.

That's nearly the end of this week's show. Just a quick quickly a couple more items. And the reference in that piece to Baruch Spinoza. And his pitting spiders against each other is actually a true story. It comes from Isaac Disraeli in his curiosities of literature. And in a in an essay in this in that book in that collection called amusements of the learned. We're told that after protracted studies, Spinoza would unbend his mind by setting spiders to fight each other. He observed their combat with so much interest that he was often seed within moderate fits of laughter. So if you're looking for a past time, on these cold evenings, spider fighting is obviously something you could do when you'd be following in the footsteps of a great philosopher. And the other thing I quickly wanted to mention was that I got an email. I got an email from PayPal, you know, kind of just a circular, circular email from PayPal. And one of the things that said we had this little sort of head and shoulders shot of a customer services person and a word balloon next to his head, and in this word balloon, it said, I helped a customer identify bird eggs, exclamation mark. It had never before occurred to me that when seeking to identify birds eggs, the first port of call should be a PayPal customer services person. However, now I know. And I'll be bombarding them with all my birds eggs, identification quandaries, and you should do likewise. And while you're at PayPal, checking up on your birds eggs, don't forget to give arms to the hooting yard fighting fund, you'll find a link on the hooting yard website. And just one last thing I think we should now call it egg pal rather than PayPal. So that's what it's called From now on in hooting yard. And that's the end of this week's show. Hope you've enjoyed it. learned about tin foil and apps and babinski and in the bird eggs and spiders. Yeah, I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
