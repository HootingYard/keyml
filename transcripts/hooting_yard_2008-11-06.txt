Good evening. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. I'd like to begin this week with a quotation from Oprah Winfrey. Yes, very early yesterday morning in Chicago. She said, I've been pulsating all day. And now I'm in full vibration mode. This is the most, this is the most meaningful thing that has ever happened. I didn't know that Oprah Winfrey was a listener to hooting out at least I presume that's what she was talking about. It's good to have her on board. And maybe she'd like to join club key of which more later on maybe next week, depending on how we get on. The other day, as I was bumbling about town, I was waylaid by a wild eyed chap who dragged me down an alleyway, trapped me between some bins on a wall and didn't and demanded of me that I answer his question. And what might your question be? I asked. Well, he replied in a shaky and somewhat unhinged voice in the midst of the crunch dollar credit and the Armageddon brought on by the collapse of the global banking system is that anything, anything at all, we can grasp that as as a straw from the out of print outpourings of the pamphleteer Dobson? Now, this wasn't an unreasonable question, and it's one I'd been stealing myself to answer at some point, as each day brings news of further ruination and collapse, particularly in Iceland, the least populous and second smallest of the Nordic countries have volcanically and geologically active Ireland on the Mid Atlantic ridge. Many fjords punctuate its extensive coastline, and there are many geezers its native beasts include the Icelandic, sheep, Icelandic cattle, Icelandic, chicken, Icelandic goat, and the sturdy Icelandic horse. Polar bears occasionally visit the island traveling on icebergs from Greenland. Birds, especially sea birds, are a very important part of Iceland's animal life. puffins skuas and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs. Yet, spite of such interesting features, nothing It seems can stop the destruction of Iceland's banking system. I managed to persuade my wild either silent to I'm Hand me and suggested that we could talk more productively away from the noise some of the bins. He agreed and we decamped to a churchyard rife with Sycamore and large and laburnum in the shade of which we leaned against a couple of tombstones, each to his own tombstone. And I was about to begin my reply when my white layer declared that he had a great thirst upon him, and that he intended to scamper hotfoot to a nearby grocers to obtain refreshments. He would, he said, be back in a jiffy. And off he went. I was pleased to be given an interval in which to collect my thoughts. I've been ransacking my brain for nuggets indeed with jewels to scatter into the planer mulch of my reply. We can use all sorts of metaphors to help us picture the mind. And I'm fond of the one that fancies it as an attic crammed with packing cases and trunks and cardboard boxes. We hold ourselves up a ladder into the attic and pick our way by torchlight among the crates, opening this one on that as we go. And sometimes we find what we're searching for and sometimes we hit upon the unexpected bladder bladder. I have as you know, an extensive knowledge of Dobson and his works, but in order to answer the question I'd been asked I would have to prise open some of the most securely nailed down packing cases of all in the furthest corners of my cerebral attic.

I had a vague memory that the pamphleteer had much to say about the German DAX and if I could recall where he said it and in what context, I thought sure it would lead me to remember with blinding clarity, all sorts of other Dobson isms regarding not just the Teutonic stock market but other stock markets, and by extension, other financial gubbins no doubt including the banking system, and then I would have a Sarah and sparklingly intelligent response to declaim onto my alleyway, abductor DAX DAX DAX. I kept repeating the word in my head, hoping to stumble upon the mental cardboard box I sought. But before I did so, my way layer returned, armed with a couple of cartons of squelched Joe, one of which he tossed to me in a casual, loose limbed fashion, as if we had been friends from childhood. I thanked him. think nothing of it, he replied, the cost of a carton of sculpture is a small price to pay for what you're about to tell me. As the value of stocks plummets around the world, a man can have no shorter a guide than Dobson. Given your encyclopedic knowledge of that Titanic pamphleteer. Those of us who have only a glancing acquaintance with him, can come to you and be given the Baumann sucker we so desperately need. So you need not thank me for a mere cartoon of sculpture. In fact, I have a mind to affect you something to eat as well as to drink right here while I get you some crinkle cut oven chips and a cardboard cone. And off he went again. I redoubled my fuming mental activity, which I'm afraid consists of simply repeating DAX, DAX, DAX over and over again. This time I said it aloud, and became aware of a rustling in a clump of graveyard shrubbery. DAX, DAX, DAX, I babbled and out of the foliage bounded enormous hound. I think it was a massive, massive one. Whatever it was, it sprang at me and sank it gleaming fangs into my cravat. It was going for the flesh of my neck, of course, but I were densely woven cravats designed by the chromatic Elspeth Banshee, and even the most savage of pooches would have trouble getting its fangs clean through one of her creations. The weight of the dog knocked me over, however, and as I fell, I banged my head on the tombstone upon which I was leaning. Before I lost consciousness, I was aware of dreadlocked scapegrace emerging from the shrubbery in pursuit of the mat. I remember thinking that the laws of nature demand that lanky, stringy, bearded white rasters keep their dogs on the ends of length of string, and that I had just been felled by an anomaly. I came to thinking I was covered in blood, but it was just the spillage from my carton of sculpture. to one side of me stood the indigent, with his unleashed bound to the other my earlier a silent clutching a cardboard cone of crinkle cut oven chips. I sat up. Let me get this straight, I said, turning to the bedraggled wretch. I asked him to confirm that his dog was called DAX, and that this had occasioned its flying leap at me. He nodded. And you I said, turning to the other, have brought me a cardboard cone of oven trips which have yet to see the innards of an oven, and that's remain frozen, and will doubtless take quite some time to thaw out in the crisp autumn chill of this October morning. Correct? And he nodded to. Sometimes I wonder why it is, as I wander this fair city, the only people I come into contact with as affectless and the desperate and the seedy and the second the stupid. I rub the back of my head where it had taken a tombstone, clunk, pulled my Elspeth Banshee cravat into a particularly fettering cravat was more RAM my neck stood up, plop my drain sculpteo carton into a municipal waste bin and strode away out of the churchyard, whistling magnificently, witnessing civilization crashing around my ears, as happy as a pig in a mud bath.

If you're planning to introduce the phrase, let the cat out of the bag into a conversation. You can give your words a weightier punch by having a bag with a cat in it ready to be released at the right moment. This is a very on top of the argument from demonstration. And when we're looking at methods of adding heft to what we say it can be very effective. The technique is simple. First, obtain a cat. The standard domestic moggy will suffice and you could pick one up from an animal shelter or pet shop. I don't recommend average ducting one while it dozing in the sunlight on the window sill of a happy family home, for that would be very wrong of you. And now you probably would not be sent to prison. A black stain would be seared upon your immortal soul for the crime of causing misery to blameless citizens, leaving bereft infants sobbing into their pillows, as they spend fitful night lamenting the loss of tittles. Make a note of that, in case you're tempted to cut corners, and go out marauding on the lookout for the first cat to cross your path. Choosing a bag is slightly more problematic, but only if you dim. Clearly the bag must be big enough for the cat to fit inside it. And it must have some form of clasp or seal. If you've not grasped that much, go and get your brain hardened up at a cranial integuments stiffening facility and come back when you're less of a fool. The rest of you will have gathered that as long as it meets the above provisos, pretty much any bag will do. It's unwise to spend excessively on some kind of designer handbag, a choice you might make if you're an oligarch or a plutocrat. Even if you have the riches of creases, there are much more constructive uses for your money such as donating goodly sums to a charitable fund for out of print pamphleteers. Incidentally, the act of making such a donation is guaranteed to remove from your immortal soul any black stains or other bits merchants with which it has been said or smeared. So listen up. I'm not suggesting that by handing your money over to an impecunious Scribbler, you're there by excuse snatching a cherished family pet from it windowsills slumber. So don't go thinking you can weigh the evil act against the good. Anyway, just get the damn bag and put the lawfully obtained cat into it. simply pick up the cat, put it in the bag and use the fastening mechanism whatsoever it may be to ensure the cat stays put until you're ready. Let us leap forward in time to the exciting moment in the conversation that always is leading up to us sitting in an armchair. The bag with the cat in it is on your lap. To add a vivid if unnecessary detail. This is picture your interlocutor looming over you standing at the fireplace, stabbing the air with his pipe as he speaks. Blah, blah blah. He says his words are unimportant in this context, for all our attention is rightly upon you, you who have learned that it pays to increase your word power, blah, blah blah. He continues seemingly unstoppable until he pauses to take a puff of his pipe a glow with expensive Montenegrin tobacco obtainable only through a specialist supplier in the most exclusive quarter of your city. You take the opportunity of his brief silence to say ha, that's let the cat out of the bag. And as you crow the word you unfasten the bag and let the cat out of it. quad erat demonstrate random. This ploy will work on a handful of occasions, after which it begins to lose its effectiveness. Thereafter, both the bag and the cat will need to be given new purposes in your life. You can use the back hole potatoes back for a market or to places a hood over the head of any hostage you see fit to take if you're that way inclined. As for the cat, it will be happy with regular bowls of milk and a supply of maimed but still living field mice or small birds. When I posted that piece originally on the hooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org in the comments on that piece fitzmorris trenary one of my readers wrote the following.

I suggest introducing variety to the proceedings, not to mention avoiding waste by using the same cat for the demonstration of other Proverbs, metaphors and figures of speech to wit, let us not upset the apple Cat Cat to be balanced upon a Bramley apple or vice versa. Like a cat upon a Hot Tin Ruth cat to be balanced upon a tin toy Ruth Kelly automaton there is more than one way to skin a cat cat to be conveyed sideways across the surface of a tub of water. And a cat has nine lines, nine lines to be attached The cat by means of fruiter is adhesive.

It's well worth remembering that if you visit the hooting our website, you can leave comments on pieces and I sometimes read those comments on air so you can have your own words. broadcast on resonance, what could be better than that? And while we're talking about such things, just to remind you that the new hooting, your paperback gravitas, punctilious rectitude and peppy bags is now available, so you should buy at least one copy the ideal Christmas gift. Go to the website and you'll see a picture of the cover click on that and that will take you to where you can buy it. Meanwhile, you would do well to remember, if ever you're out walking in the vicinity of the farmyard at screwin hoon Puj that you may come face to face with the fainting goat. If you encounter it on the lane leading out of the farmyard towards the orchard, and as soon as it sees you it topples over in a swoon, you must not be alarmed, you must certainly not think that the goat has fainted because you have caused it fright by dint of something alarming in your appearance. Even if there is something terrifying about you, such as a twisted up face or two brightly colored clinco jacket or you're being armed with a mailorder mannlicher carcano snipers rifle, none of the things will be what causes the goat to faint. The goat will faint for the reasons it's known as the fainting goat, which is that it is constantly fainting dozens of times a day, even dozens of times an hour. This constant swooning is a mystery as far as the local vets are concerned, there are several vets with practices in walking or short bus journey distance of screwed whom pooch farmyard and all of them at one time or another has been called to tend to the fainting goat. They've tried all sorts of treatments from goat friendly smelling salts to the deployment of Peruvian whistling vessels to simply shouting very loudly into the goat ear. And those such techniques may revive the goat from its faint. None have served to stop it clattering over a dead swoon again and again. As the long countryside day draws on towards dusk and rainfall. When it's conscious, the goat seems hale and hearty, even frisky and engages in all the normal activities one might expect of a farmyard goat. I would list these activities, but I'm sure you're thoroughly up to speed with the doings of goats, given the demographic of the hooting yard audience there's been a certain amount of bickering among the local vets as each of them grows frustrated that their inability to stop the continual fainting of the fainting goat. When they passed out of their veterinary colleges. They were all brimming with confidence, armed as they thought with the knowledge and expertise to handle all sorts of bestie maladies from the worker day to the exotic, whether it be a cow with a pox or an ostrich beset by von strathalbyn Z's gruesomeness these vets believed they could march into a farm yard or Menagerie. And when the undying gratitude of farmers and menagerist by weaving their vetti spells, an injection here a siphoning off of fluid there. And so the Gospels of their keepers, the cow or ostrich or whatever beast, it may be, would leap up restore to vigor, and there would be a round of applause and the descript passing of banknotes into the pocket of the smug vet. But the fainting goat goat, but the fainting goat goes on fainting day in day out, and not one of the vets has a clue what to do about it. When they gather have an evening on the balcony of the cafe Simon Sharma. At first they boast of their breakthroughs. The splinter fixed to the leg of the sparrow the gunk drain from the Badgers boils the polzeath pig on palsy, but as I sit there fermented slops, tempers frayed and the talks turns to the fainting goat that damned intractable fainting goat and harsh words are said and they're spitting and chucking and fisticuffs, black eyes and bruises and the odd daggers slash. And so it goes on night after night. Now curiously enough during the night to fainting goat never faint, it remains wide awake all night every night, either in its comfy pan or out in some field, doing goatee things, things other goats doing daylight,

apprised of this singular information. Some have posited that the goat swoons are not swoons so much as it's repeatedly falling asleep from exhaustion. It is indeed a cogent case but it's nevertheless mistaken for reasons crystal clear to those such as some among the vets who've made studies of the goats neurological peculiarities. it sleeps not yet it faints. The one is understood and explicable the other not. There are more curious cases among the goat population as among other farmyard beasts, but not many Sure enough, that's why the vets fret so but you will not fret Will you as you wander past screwed Hoon pooch farmyard on your way to the orchard to pluck persimmons from the trees illegally, and you come upon the fainting goat upon the path and it faints at your feet. You will pat it lift all horns and lift it to its feet and send it tottering off along the lane to its next collapse, for you are wiser than the vets. You're wiser than the farmer. The only thing wiser than you is the fainting goat itself. No goat was ever wiser. Nor had so explosive a brain.

I'm just gonna have a sip of tea Hold on. I was talking the other day with someone about barbarians. I think we were probably talking about Andy Burnham, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport anyway. Speaking of barbarians, it's not often that you come upon the chieftain of a barbarian horde whose name is Chauncey. So I was pleased to learn about a chap called that this morning when I popped into my local Andy Burnham chat and snack zone, fought my waiter a gaggle of feral hoodies and sought refuge in the cupboard where a few reference books have been stashed. Soon, I'm sure they'll end up in a line pit to join the quarter of a million books willfully destroyed by Waltham Forest counsel in the last couple of years. Yes, a quarter of a million. But for now, at least I have a chance to browse through them for anything which might catch my eye. And it was an article about Chauncey that I lighted upon in a big fat book called A Biographical Dictionary of barbarian chieftains who swept across the plains with their hordes on horseback, wreaking mayhem and leaving ruination in their wake, with six maps and 26 mezzotints. Most of the entries were for barbarian chieftains with names like hengest and Blake van hangboard. So it was quite a surprise to find one called Chauncey his full name was given us traunsee kitten, rich the third, and to me that sounded more like a blue blooded Boston Brahmin and a barbarian chieftain. But what do I know? Actually, it turned out that Chauncey was indeed the spawn of a wealthy New England family destined for a career in the banking sector. But that wants to strike a horse, some sort of atavistic impulse impelled him to barbarism and sweeping across the plains at the head of a horde. Throughout history, the plains favored by barbarian hordes for sweeping across from west to east have been those that stretch from Asia into Europe. So Chauncey was miffed to find himself on an inappropriate continent. Thus, it was that he bid farewell to the living members of the Khitan Ridge dynasty and made his way to Asia picking up ruffians as he traveled whom He impressed into the ranks of his Horde. He was careful to choose only bloodthirsty thugs who sat well upon horses for he intended when the time came. For sweeping across the plains to be fearsome in the extreme, and it would not do to have among his hoard the feckless or the merciful or the weedy. chauncy himself, however, never lost the impeccable manners that had been drummed into him from childhood. And even at the height of his barbaric career was as much at home in the dining room of a Grand Hotel as he was setting fire to a barn in some godforsaken village that had the misfortune to be in his path, as his hoard swept across the plains. As a chieftain, Chauncey had a natural air of authority, and he added to it by sprouting a magnificently hairy beard and by festooning his person with big battered bits of jewelry and Raymond, these were not the sorts of adornments that could be mistaken for girly fripperies for like a heavy and chunky and some will not even have precious metals, but were fashion from the bones and pelts of slaughtered animals. Usually those that charged terrified out of the barns the Horde set fire to is like rock mayhem in their sweeping progress from east to west, leaving ruination in their wake. Chauncey was particularly fond of a necklace made from the rip cages of goats and chickens, and he liked to polish this with a rag as his hauled in camp for the night warmed by the blaze of a burning barn. It's been argued that had Chauncey not been so keen on barbarism, he would have made a fine military commander in the conventional sense. He certainly knew how to keep his horde loyal to him and suffered no mutinies. He had the knack of instilling camaraderie among his vicious ruffians by encouraging rousing sing songs as they laid waste to villages and hamlets. Songs often have his own composition, usually taking for their subject matter. Episodes of violence and havoc and chaos close to his heart. sprightly numbers such as Whoa, boys, let us burn down the bomb. Hey, whoa, boys. Let us pillage the village and Heidi Hey, whoa, boys, let us cast the library books into a line pit might have topped the pop charts had such things been on the radar of a barbarian horde? But of course they would not. And the very idea that they could have been is simply a foolish fancy, diverting as it may be to imagine a Eurovision or Asiatic

Song Contest, in which the winners are a tangle of blood soaked barbarians festooned with golden Kimbo necklaces. According to the Biographical Dictionary, chauncy eventually succumb to on we, his barbarian hordes swept across the plains from east to west double back swept across them again headed back and swept across them yet again dozens of times, wreaking ruination and it appears there came a point when Chauncey felt that the urges within his soul had been placated. At night, he began to have dreams of lawns in New England upon which he would sprawl wearing a boater and sharing a picnic with a socialite. When giving orders to his Horde. His voice turned to withdrawal as if he were gorby doll reminiscing about the bouviers and the Kennedys and the orphan clauses yearn to attend a weekend party at a Chappaquiddick Marina. And so, one vile morning on the outskirts of village of a destroyed village somewhere on the plains across which he was sweeping. He announced that he was disbanding the Horde. He paid off his thugs with hogsheads of bitter grog and distributed among them his baubles of bones and jewelry, and then he galloped upon his horse to a city with a swish hotel, where he booked in and shaved off his mighty beard. Some weeks later, his barbaric gloveless decisively a thing of the past, shortly boarded a transatlantic liner ready to return home and to exchange your mess of pottage for his birthright. He's not written their head to the kickin reduce, but he was confident that he would meet with a warm welcome, and if he did not was prepared to slip back temporarily into barbarism and unleash pitiless violence, even without his horde to back him up. In the event, it was not a choice he was forced to make for the transatlantic liner, which we embarked was the jewel of the White Star Line, the Titanic and he went down with it in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. And that's the end of this week's show. Bye bye
