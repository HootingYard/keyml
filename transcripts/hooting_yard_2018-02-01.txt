Your tune to resonance 104 point four FM, the art of listening.

Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM. And my name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air on the road to recovery from the illness that felled me for all of January actually, as two weeks ago, I came into the studio managed to do my show and we probably spent the next few hours vomiting. I'm not sure there's anything to do with resonance. But anyway, so last week, I wasn't here, but now I'm back. And I hope to remain back. Anyway. So bad formed with the police by the teaming ramifications of the inscript case that they had no idea what to do, until a dejected inspector threw in the towel and suggested reluctantly, that they call in tahltan. The amateurs amateur in hopes that he might have to clearing through their mental fog for which, to which Sorry, I'm going to start again because I misread that. So baffled why the police by the teaming ramifications of the inspect case, but they had no idea what to do, until a dejected inspector threw in the towel, and suggested reluctantly, that they call in Talton, the amateurs amateur in hope that he might hacker clearing through their mental forest, to which telethons response upon receipt of the coppers telegram was to instruct his helped meet the dwarf crops go to pay them a visit and pull one of his faces at them. To which keepass goes response was, are you sure said in a trembling voice, that he was all too well aware that when he pulled one of his faces the effect on those who saw it was akin to something from a story by HP Lovecraft, reducing the witness to a horror stricken gibbering wreck fit only to be chained up in an asylum for the incurably insane for the rest of their days. But Talton insisted, telling Pascoe to call face number 43 expressive of fathomless and bitter contempt.

So the dwarf toggled off along the line towards the police station, and on his way encountered as chance would have it one of the teaming ramifications of the inspect case, in that not too far along the way. He tripped and toppled into the bottom was a viper pit of Hubert ness, and was mightily surprised of the falling just a few feet to land with a crunch upon a false bottom in the Viper pit, a platform installed by unknown hand, possibly, but not definitively in slips. The crunchy nature of his landing, caused by the biscuit moment upon the platform of eggshells in great abundance, with no sign whatsoever of the eggs in it, the albumin and yellow yolk and whatever, whatever else an egg expert might describe inside an egg. They were just the shells upon which Pascoe landed crunchy before sitting up and rubbing his bonds, and wondering why he had not continued to fall forever and ever, as surely to be in his fate. The Viper pit of shrubbery ness, like the fact of God, and several others, being victorious for being bottomless. According to the guidebooks and gas that is available from the souvenir kiosk located at one end of a sort of modern day ley line along which magnets cease to function and clumps of veteran bind we'd withered at the other end of which stood surrounded by an imposing fence fitted with floodlights the police station, we're in the frazzled coppers we're still awaiting a response from Tarleton, the amateurs amateur and busying themselves Meanwhile, by rummaging for the umpteenth time, through their miles of filing cabinets in which every last Rapid information regarding the inspect case was kept from that very first report of an eyewitness, I preternaturally alert passers by, who had tested negative for hallucinogens thrice, and who had brought breathlessly panting, panting, to the coppers attention, the curious circumstance, that in screen hunahpu model village, the aviary behind the milk factory, with life size, and filled with real birds, such that they would appear enormous and monstrous, to the tiny little fingers populating the model village, and their cause and curbs and corrupts, and trills deafeningly loud, and that this anomaly was just the kind of thing in spirit would clap his hands with glee over though try as they might not a single officer could say with any certainty, hand on heart that inspect had formed in the area, nor indeed, that he even knew where the screwin hunahpu model village was, given that all reported sightings of him for the past two decades placed him elsewhere. And he had been banned from consulting maps and atlases for even longer than that, ever since the box shadow puppetry case, when he was albeit briefly in cahoots or up to his eyeballs as Detective Captain tog pan put it with babinski the lumbering walrus mustache psychopathic serial killer and alliance that was mercifully short lived, thanks to kargh pan, the very same card pan who now rummaging in one of the filing cabinets chanced upon a tattered black and white snapshot of an unidentified Acrobat, performing an unidentified feat of acrobatics, which would have seemed physically impossible. We're not for the photographic evidence. And on a whim accident, the detective Captain looked at the snapshot from a geometrically unlikely angle. And so suddenly, what nobody else had seen before himself included, which was that in her poisoned tub, Sara bateau, the Acrobat seemed to be personating the exact lineaments of the stick figures in the corner of an emblem on the flag of a secret society, the doings or misdoings of which had ravaged several important colonial outposts, and not a few unimportant ones. at the tail end of the war, one of the wars and which had long been thought consigned to the dustbin of history, but which can't pan now realized with a lovecraftian shudder, could indeed still be active and engaged in nefarious shenanigans here and now, and particularly in the model village at screwin hunahpu. And he grabbed a butcher's pencil, and began scribbling frenziedly in the copper jotting pad. And then he rummaged in some of the other filing cabinets, and tore some of his hair out until he jumped up onto a desk in the middle of the Situation Room, gaining the immediate and rapt attention of all the other coppers to whom he cried ear piercingly, where are the eggs? Where are the eggs, and they all knew at once he was referring to the various birds eggs laid by the anomalous really life sized birds in the aviary of the model village. And, gosh, this is exciting. At that very moment. crop. Pascoe,

the dwarf, who had managed to clamber out of the temporarily non bottomless Viper pit of shrubbery ness, came blundering into the room, dozens of bits of eggshell clinging to his clothing, and he was about to pull his fathomless and bitter contempt face number 43 when a sixth sense, stopped him, seeing the blazing eyes of detective Captain tog pan, and all the other coppers gazing at him with an unmistakable dream of dawning understanding and clarity as when pennies drop from heaven. Every time it rains, and the clouds burst, and it was raining now, as it always rains on the feast day of St. bibley. Babe, for Yes, this all happened on Biblis they did state which is why it is significant, and why I have told you about it. For how it happened on any other day in the calendar year, it would hardly be worth mentioning. And it would have remained one of those untold stories of Tarleton. The amateurs amateur, untold and unknown, never collected in any of the many volumes devoted to his doings, all of which, like the pamphlets of the pamphleteer Dobson. are out of print.

I started reading that sentence two weeks ago and completely missed on the program. So I have to cut it off in the in the middle. I mean why that? That was I reread the whole thing. It's only one sentence, but I regret it for a shadowy government official who has apparently been waiting to hear the rest of it.

The ride on Entebbe disambiguation. The right on Entebbe can refer to one, a hostage rescue mission carried out by commandos of the Israeli Defense Force at Entebbe Airport in Uganda, on the Fourth of July 1976, to a 1977 film dramatization of the incident, starring Peter Finch, who surname is also the common term for medium sized passerine birds in the family frigid fringer delight. Free fringilla Yes, fingrid dilke fringilla fringy lead fringilla die, something like that. Three. The right on a terabyte is the given name of a pet hamster kept by the pot boiling paperback is pebble head. pebble head was once asked in an interview why he had named his hamster the ride on Entebbe. This is what he said by way of reply. I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't got a pet hamster. I grant you there is a small cage over there fitted with a wheel for a small mammal to run around on like a mad thing aligned with Excelsior or wood wall for the comfort of such a small mammal. And yes, there is a strong hand story odor in the vicinity of the cage. But I cannot get you to show me an actual hamster that challenged the journalist interviewing pebble head pointed to what looked undoubtedly like a hamster, nestling in the corner of the cage, almost covered in Excelsior and fast asleep. Blimey said pebble head. Where did that come from? a press statement was later issued on pebble heads behalf by a crack team of brain doctors. For some time now, pebble head has been suffering from what's the medical profession terms intermittent hamster blindness. The condition is debilitating and incurable. Although the symptoms can be alleviated with a combination of intravenous drugs, eyedrops and frenzied activity, for example, battling out potboilers on a typewriter, the rate of several novels a week. Incidentally, all of us have previously served as commandos in the Israeli Defense Force. So if you know of any hostages who need to be rescued from African airfields do drop us a line. pebble heads latest potboiler invisible hamster mayhem, is now available from all good pet shops.

It was a dark and stormy night Have the Camtasia knock on the wild and churning waters. The HMS with an art was being tossed about like so much flotsam. The ship's captain Captain Plunkett was all too aware that it was here off the Kentish knock on a similarly dark and stormy night in 1875 that the SS Deutschland had been wrecked and five Franciscan nuns, including a peculiarly tall one had suffered death by drowning. Captain Plunkett had no Franciscan nuns aboard his ship, unless they were stowaways of his presence. He was ignorant, but well he knew the HMS with art within equal danger of wreckage on so dark and stormy night. It would take all his mastery of the nautical art to bring the ship and its crew safely through to dawn and port. clinging to the wheel he cried out for the first mate, first mate Hoon, weedy and neurasthenic get impossibly valiant Hoon came staggering onto the bridge. He was sopping wet, drenched by both the teeming rain and by sloshing rain seawater. Hoon, yelled the captain over the howling Gale. It has suddenly occurred to me that we may have stowaways a board of whom I am ignorant nuns, Franciscan nuns hiding in the panicles detail a detail of deckhands to search every last inch II Captain yelled hoon. But I've just had a report over the reactive hooter from the print talks that the panicles of fabbed Captain Plunkett took one hand off the wheel, curled it into a sort of perch, turned it towards his head and bent forward, resting his mouth and keen on his hand, striking an attitude almost identical to Rodin's thinker. He was thinking, he was thinking how it could have happened on his watch that the panicles had been farmed. He was thinking how it had come about that he had not heard the print Cox's message over the reactive hooter. He was thinking that he had completely forgotten the name of the print box. And he was thinking that if they were ready, stowaway Franciscan nuns hiding in the panicles of the HMS with art, then they would surely have things cocked by the phubbing. When he had finished thinking, he lifted his head, put his hand back to the wheel, and cried aloud again to first meet Hoon, hoon. Scrub that last command to detail a detail of deckhands. I kept him I've obliterated it from my brain so rapidly and thoroughly that already I have forgotten to what the word it refers. The wind continued to howl and rage, the rain to team the sea to slosh and the salt and the storm to toss the ship upon the waters. Hoon, cried the captain. What is the name of the print talks? I know him only as Alan shattered the first mate, as in lad or wicker, or Freeman, known as fluff. The pink ox is called fluff, Captain Plunkett. I kept in by those of the crew who are radio enthusiasts. Detail fluff to man the dire fanes hoon, II captain, and who left the bridge staggering belowdecks in search of the print Cox, the storm did not abate. The captain struggled manfully with the wheel. His head was now empty of thought he was engaged in an elemental battle, man versus sea, or man versus storm, or better, perhaps man versus stormy sea. Meanwhile, on one of the decks, poop bought all up, one of the urine dolls had been torn loose from its Cantor lane, and was clattering about perilously. firstmate hoon, making his slow and steady progress to the print Cox's nest, saw what happened and realized he had to make an instant decision. There was no time to think he could not afford the car one hand into a sort of perch, turn it towards his head and bend forward, resting his mouth and chin on his hand, striking an attitude almost identical to Rodin's thinker. He staggered back to the bridge. Captain Plunkett, he screened

one of the urine gold has been totally loose from its Canada Line, and it's cluttering about perilously on the poop all up deck. Where is fluff the print Cox? cried the captain. Still in his nest I expect yelled hoon. for when I saw that one of the urine dolls had been torn loose from it can't align. And with clattering about perilously on the pooper all up deck. I made an instant decision to tell you about it as soon as I possibly could. You should have used the reductive hooter. cried Captain Plunkett, believe me, Captain, I would have done had you heard the Rakuten message regarding the fabbed panicles. But you did not and I did not risk that a second record of huta message would go unheard by you. That shows good seamanship. Who, cried the captain. Let me pin a golden star to your cap. Thank you, Captain. I appreciate that recognition. it compensates for the lack of pay and the worm riddled biscuits. And all of a sudden, there was a lull in the storm, and the captain and the first might look up at the stars in the sky. For a few precious moments, the HMS with our art was safe upon the sea, and down below in the panicles. The sudden calm prompted five stowaway Franciscan nuns, of whose presence Captain Plunkett was ignorant, one peculiarly tool to pop their heads out from the rickety Fisk's were in they were hiding, and to sing a hymn of thanks to Almighty God that he had delivered them from the phubbing.

I'm heritage limericks and evil demented fabrika, who's sick brain grew sicker and sicker, said to Edward Woodward, I suggest that you should be encased in a man made of wicker. There was a demented fat Vicar. His sick brain grew sicker and sicker. At a showbiz party, he stabbed Russel Hardy, and then he impaled now and with her.

JOHN just reminded me of courses the great Russell haathi plus, which was the show that he did for many years and for years, I thought his name was actually Russell hearty plus. The other thing to note here is that how often how often on the radio Do you hear the name Alan whicker twice in one show? In 2018? Yes, yes. When I said it, then it was the third time What time is it? Oh, I was about to start reading something and realize that there wouldn't be time to read the whole thing. So we'd end up with another of those terrible moments when when I don't have time to finish things. Anyway. So this there should be time for this. This is called the flapper who outwitted babinski and as far as I know, doesn't contain any mentions of Alan whicker. That was the fourth mentioned in her distant youth, the bateau main Nan que was a flat but not yet smitten by the ballet. She liked to flap about in speakeasies. Oh, excuse me. I'm going to start again. Hang on. I need a sip of water.

The flapper who outwitted babinski in her distant youth, the babyletto main Nan que was a flapper not yet smitten by the ballet she liked to flap about in speakeasies. getting dizzy on elicit cocktails, and executing the latest dance crazes, to the sound of Boogie woogie, and similar musical wiggies as performed by hot jazz quintet led by rascals. It was in one speakeasy on 43,700 and 22nd street that Nan que encountered the lumbering walrus mustache psychopathic serial killer babinski. In those days, of course, the phrase serial killer had not yet been coined. So babinski his modus operandi remained sub Rosa, and he did not have couples on his trail. The whole thing falls polisi may not have had their eyes on bubinski that night, but somebody else did. lurking in the speakeasy sub fosc was the serial killers. long lost idiot half brother babinski. Two, he was watching babinski his every move and what moves babinski was out on the dance floor, essaying some new dance steps of his own invention, which he called the lumbering psychopath. Those of you familiar with the dances of the era will recall it from it. abbreviated name, the lumber psych, which became wildly popular and spawned such hot jazz standards as Papa Don gone walked off my limbs again and polka dots hair oil and brutality. Now it so happened that this time babinski to was Nan Cuse paramour, they seem the nail matched couple, the flapper and the idiot, but there was a definite if inextricable chemistry between them. Plus it was that Nan que dizzy on illicit cocktails and slump somewhat lopsidedly against babinski to in their booth in the speakeasy gloom, new without asking why her darling was transfixed by the lumbering brute on the dance floor babinski too long for a reconciliation with his long lost brother, from whom he had been partied ever since that catastrophic picnic on the edge of the forest at the end of the war, or had it been at the beginning of the war, so fuddled with his brain, but bubinski, too, could no longer remember. All he knew was, he had a burning desire to climb trees, and play, pin the antenna on the Locust again, with his brother to relive their carefree childhood, in the shadow of the big formidable mountains. But idiots that he was even bubinski to knew that his half brother, being a psychopath, wanted nothing more than to drive an axe into his babinski two's scowl, and then chop off his head and boil it in one of his horrible grease encrusted VAT in his horrible grease encrusted cellar beneath his horrible grease encrusted chalet. And so all he could do was to sit in the darkened booth, gazing up Verbinski with love and longing and terror. Then dizzy manku had an idea. I'm sure he won't recognize you. If you don a disguise. She slurred in her woozy way, we could get you up as 11th time toothbrush salesman, or crippled Dutch ski lift, operative, and bubinski will never get your true identity. Then, if we persuade him there is a cuddly little hamster or guinea pig trapped at the top of that sycamore tree in the street, outside the speakeasy. The two of you can climb it together, just as if you were carefree tots before that picnic. Meanwhile, I won't get a pencil and paper and a pen and a blindfold. And when you come back in you can play that foolish game you are both so fond of. What a fantastic idea. shouted babinski to planting a kiss on man cues flashed cheek. You will just have to convince your half brother that the hamster or guinea pig atop the tree is an invisible one added the flapper. But that should not prove difficult. Just tell him there has been a plague of invisible small covering mammals in helping fools.
