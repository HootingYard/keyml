Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting yard on the air. Between the gubbins is and the babblings. There has been since time immemorial, a blood feud, but only just in English law. time immemorial is defined as any date before the third of September 1189. And the incident which prompted the blood feud happened on the evening of the second of September, in that tempestuous year. It was we're told an altercation next to a pond and involved a gubbins a beveling, and a cormorant, or possibly to cormorants. blood was shed, but as they stay, arguments persist about whether the blood was that of the gubbins or of the beveling or both, or of the cormorant or cormorants. nigh on 1000 years it's not a particularly long time for a properly constituted vendetta. By definition, intergenerational hatred and vengeance takes many generations to take root. By some accounts, it was only in the 14th century that members of both the gubbins and bevelling clans first spoke of their enmity in terms of a blood feud. Before then it was seen as a bit of a spat, or whatever word people of those distant times used for a spat. By then, of course, cormorants were no longer the cattles belly. It was simply that if you were born a gubbins, you hated the babblings and vice versa. Any members of Bournemouth council who are listening to this piece, and are offended by my use of Latin in the last two sentences can go and boil our own heads. The boiling of heads incidentally was a favorite tactic of both parties in the blood feud, as was the slicing off of limbs, the discoloration of infants and the impalement upon iron spikes of any gubbins wandering absent mindedly into beveling territory, or, again, vice versa. Those were gore splattered times to be sure. Indeed, so blood Grange to the feud become by the 16th century that certain figures in both clans of a modernist and civilizing cast of mind decided to strike a pact. Such an initiative was unpopular with the mass of their clans folk, for whom the feud was a mere fact of nature, like a beating heart, or a hooting owl or a drooling pauper. But the modernizers dismissed their protests, as modernizers always do from that data this in all walks of life, and proceeded to sneak about in the gloom, working away to seal the pact. Now at this time, the gubbins is we're like the Parkinson family in HG Wells isn't 1933 novel, The bumping kind of blap a sandwich inventing clan, while the babblings were like Theodore Buffington, aren't Amanda, the life and soul of a bandage making organization in the town hall. I hasten to add that it was not Bournemouth Town Hall, which has today become a Latin free bastion of ignorance. Actually, I'm not sure which Town Hall it was, for both the gubbins is and the babblings had found out across the land in the centuries since their vendetta began next to a pond on that September evening in 1189. The modernizers on both sides sense that if they could find a commonality of purpose in the inventing of sandwiches and the making of bandages, they could convincingly press the case for the pact they dreamed of. But is there any demonstrable connection between sandwiches and bandages? I must have discovered something because the pact was eventually struck, with a nod to historical resonance on the evening of the second of September 1589. It met immediately with a retort from a disgruntled gubbins and an enraged beveling the modernizers from both clans were rounded up and bound with chains and drowned in the very pond where once a cormorant or cormorants had sparked the vendetta in the first place. And ever since the blood feud has continued, a deepened and intensified and it's likely that it would have overwhelmed the entire land by now, we're at not that both the gubbins is and the beveling was such insular clans. That Like what riddled with inbreeding, leading to an ever shrinking dream pool. And they've almost died out safer a few halfwit survivors, many of whom can be found sitting in the council chambers of our seaside resorts dribbling.

Frank Key  05:40
So that was a piece which involve various mentions of born with counsel. The reason I mentioned them is because born with counsel he famously banned all Latin from their official document, including e g, which they thought people would miss read as egg free. I'm glad I don't live in Bournemouth. Anyway, um, according to the old adage, the best banisters are the sturdiest banisters. There's a great deal of wisdom in this simple phrase, as many unsteady persons who may otherwise have toppled to their deaths can attest. But it's a saying which has been willfully ignored by trendy Bannister maker Tim snap, who's peddling his latest design. A Bannister rail made of crate paper thickened with cow gum. We sent a roving hooting yard reporter to interview Mr. Snap interesting Mr. snaps voice sounds exactly like my own, but it's not.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
I'm astonished to see you leaning in Susie and me against your crepe paper and calgon banisters Tim given there have it stands between you and a yawning stairwell down which you could plunge to your death.

Frank Key  07:03
You should add for the benefit of your listeners that I'm leaning my full wave against the banisters.

Unknown Speaker  07:11
If you don't mind me saying so, Tim. You're quite a chubby Bannister maker. So there must be quite a bit of weight for your banisters to support.

Frank Key  07:21
That is indeed so

Unknown Speaker  07:23
if I were to give you a shove in a joshing sort of manner, as between a couple of pals, would your Bannister withstand the added pressure suddenly put upon it?

Frank Key  07:33
I certainly hope so.

Unknown Speaker  07:36
Let's test it, shall we?

Frank Key  07:37
Well, before you do, please note that this new Bannister rail like all my banisters is primarily decorative.

Unknown Speaker  07:43
Are you trying to weasel your way out of my shoving test?

Frank Key  07:47
Quite frankly. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  07:49
I think that tells us all we need to know.

Frank Key  07:53
There is you say a point to those old adages and a reason why they have survived. They express truths both big and little crews. So when next you come upon a snaggletooth peasant sitting on a fence, chewing a piece of straw and mumbling a litany of folk wisdom, do not dismiss what they say. Sometimes their sayings may seem to be blathering nonsense. As for example, a pig on the line can cause you a sprain. Or when you see a door ajar, tug your forelock to the master up at the big house. If you reflect for long enough even upon the most ludicrous seeming utterance, you'll eventually bow to its wisdom and you'll be much less likely to fork over your cash to a pretentious get like Tim snap, who our reporter revealed was supported over that vertiginous stairwell not by his crate paper and cow gum banisters, but by a system of invisible winches and pulleys. Let that be a lesson to you.

Frank Key  09:27
We traveled to Hoon by hot air balloon. I took my harpoon and impaled a wolf that was roaming the woodland below us. We called the wolf into the basket of our bow of our balloon by a long and sturdy rope that was tied to the end of the harpoon. We arrived in Hoon to balloonists on an impaled wolf making a bumpy landing. The Hoon head honcho of hunted wolf was there to greet us. I will have that wolf. He said. It is not yours to keep hearing hoon. We can hunted wolves, including those that have been impaled by a harpoon shot from a hot air balloon. But we wanted to keep our harpoon wolf as a rug for the basket of our balloon. So I pulled the harpoon out of the wolf and pointed it at the man from whom we shall keep our wolf. If you try to take it, you will feel the point of this harpoon upon your neck. I said. We did not know that the man from whom was a wolf man. His head changed shape, and then the rest of him and with his savage claws, he tore the silken fabric of our balloon. We were trapped in Hoon, helpless among the wolf men.

Frank Key  11:01
I'm Andy cradle Jew who played the role of the reporter in that earlier piece, I think with some aplomb, and he's now going to read to us. quotation from Thomas de Quincey from Thomas de Quincey, his essay on the temperance movement of modern times. Bottom times, in this case being 1845 which is when this piece first appeared in Tate Edinburgh magazine. So this is Thomas de Quincey from 1845. Take it away, pansy.

Unknown Speaker  11:37
Thank you. The less variety there is that that meal breakfast, the more is the danger from any single luxury, and there is one known by the name of muffins, which has repeatedly manifested itself to be a plain and direct bounty upon suicide. Darwin in his Zoo and knowmia reports a case where an officer holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel could not tolerate a breakfast in which this odious article was wanting, but as a savage retribution, invariably supervened within an hour or two upon this act of insane sensuality, he came to a resolution that life was intolerable with muffins, but still more intolerable without muffins. He would stand the nuisance no longer. But yet being adjusted man, he would give nature one final chance of reforming her dyspeptic attrocities muffins therefore being laid at one angle of the breakfast table, and loaded pistols at another. With rigid equity the colonel awaited the result. This was naturally pretty much as usual. And then the poor man incapable of retreating from his word of honor, committed suicide, having previously left align for posterity to the effect, though I forget the expression that a muffin this world was no world for him. Better no life at all, than a life dismantled of muffins.

Frank Key  14:22
Back in my life at all, my life dismantled muffins. The title for this year's old farmer frack Memorial essay has been announced. Entrance will be challenged to write 50,000 words under the heading my favorite pigsty. This follows on from previous years where there was terrific interest in subjects such as my favorite cow buyer, my favorite hen coop and startled the poor sheep back is the ship rack then a harvest does Tempest carry the grain for the as you The rules of the contest are onerous. To commemorate old farmer frac essayists must use his own methods, which is to say that their 50,000 words have to be either scraped on site with a pointed stick, or download PowerPoint presentations. Infants have to assemble in a dilapidated barn in one of our old farmer fracks fields before dawn on the designated date. And before putting stick to slate or fingertip to keyboard, each takes it in turn to drive the surviving cows down to the drainage ditch and back bellowing all the while. The barn will be lit by a single talk a lamp hanging from the rafters. As soon as it starts to rain entrance can begin their essays and must continue writing indefatigably safer picnic breaks. These will take place at a lot of picnicking times under tarpaulins in one of the puddle riddled fields. Contestants may not discuss the progress content, General thrust or stylistic flourishes of their essays during the picnic, but confine themselves to talk of how great old farmer frack walls. It is permitted to suggest he was mad, but not too forcefully. Judges for this year's competition who will also act as invigilators in the barn include Wilf self, Wilf Amos will set Winterson and pebble head. The best selling paperback is who has been commissioned to write the Authorized Biography of wild farmer frac, and there's a previous winner of the memorial si prize. He won in the year the subject was my favorite pebble. And Crete is open to peasants, their friends and families and those with whom they have been embroiled in rustic blood feud, reaching back for untold generations. The winner will be announced on the Mughal tonin little holiday, the 19th of July. This year's prize is a muffin and a pair of loaded pistols. When that piece appeared on the hooting yard website, which I'm sure you will know the address by now. www dot hooting yard.org and I got a letter and I'll read it to you, dear Frank writes Tim thurn, who's taken to calling himself Tim thurn of that ilk, I assume in a desperate attempt to lend himself some gravitas. Anyway, he writes dear frank, I was intrigued to read in your account of the old farmer frac Memorial essay contest, that the judges would include Wilf self will famous and will fat Winterson. I've never heard of any of these people, despite being incredibly well informed in all manner of subjects. Indeed, so huge is the amount of information stored within my brain patterns that I've been compared by idiots, to Stephen Fry, and by people with a modicum of sense to Roger bacon, circa 1219 to 1294. Dr. Mirabilis, the man who it was claimed had read everything. Not wishing to doubt your word, Iran, the names these wills pass my uncle, whose name also happens to be Wilf. He looked at me witheringly, and with barely a pause, accused you of having invented your wealth and will FET out of whole cloth. These people do not exist, what his exact words and I believe him, for he has made a point during his long life of keeping tabs on all the wolf's and will FETs who have ever existed. Some may think of a foolish hobby, and it probably is, but that's my uncle wolf for you.

Frank Key  18:53
Anyway, his pronouncements set me thinking, why I asked myself would key go to the trouble of making up a couple of wills and a will FET when he must have known that he would be exposed as a fraudster and scoundrel as soon as anyone took the trouble to check. I must admit that for quite some time, I was stumped. I just sat there chewing the end of a pencil, risking lead poisoning, be flummoxed. But soon enough, it was time for uncle wolf daily outing, and I pushed him in his super widow wheelchair a few times around the pond, the pond next to the cement facsimile of the old tower of Lebanon. You will recall that as the tower which Emmanuelle not Wilf can't like to look at through his window, as he sat by the stove in circumstances of Twilight and quiet reverie. Not that he could be said properly to see it. Perhaps something of Kant's cerebral magnificence imbued my own brain, in spite of the cement copy being a poor substitute for the real tower for an a flash of insight I realized what it was you were up to. My theory which I'm going to write up into an essay and have published in some obscure non read academic journal will willing is that you were dropping great clanging hints to your readers and listeners of the full names of some of those hooting yd characters whose first names were never given. Wilf Dobson. Will Blodgett old Mar will affect purgative old farmer will frack himself. You need neither confirm nor deny that this is the case, Mr. Key for So sure, um, I have the stupendous accuracy of my flash of insight that I know as well as I know the consistency of the drone dribbling down my uncle will Shin that I will be proved correct in the harmonized court of public opinion. The only court that counts yours ever. Tim thurn of that ilk and his uncle Wolf, of that ilk.

So that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it by thanks to pansy cradle drew for her acting role and reading the quotation. Any words for for the punters?

Unknown Speaker  27:09
Hello punters it meant a lot to me to be reading about muffins. And I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. But let's let's think about it next time a little harder before we eat them.

Frank Key  27:20
Yes. Remember? Better a life without burn? I can't remember it. I'll remember it the next week. Better, not better. Yes. In fact, if you go to the website, you'll see that one of my readers from the Antiquities, Glenn Webster has designed a fantastic coat of arms or heraldic device emblazoned with that motto, the one I can't remember.

Unknown Speaker  27:51
It's kind of a memorial to the quote.

Frank Key  27:55
And it's very good. And I think you should go and have a look at it and read lots of stuff. And you can always buy the books, send donations, subscribe. Just go mad, you know. Okay, and that's it then Bye bye.
