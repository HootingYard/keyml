Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. This is hooting out on the air with me Frank key. And I'm going to read you for proximately 28 minutes. And later in the show we've got a very exciting item. But first of all, I'd like to read a story entitled disfigured nuncio. It's likely that most if not all of the non CEOs you have ever come across have been PayPal, Nancy owes. Certainly that was the case with me until a few weeks ago. I'm not a practicing Catholic, you understand? But my business activities put me in contact with many envoys from the Vatican for reasons I may go into later. So when on that blistering Thursday at the dog end of August, my facto tie announced that a nuncio had come to see me. I naturally assumed him to be of the people sort. Before I go on, I ought to explain why it took more than one factotum to make the announcement. By nature, I am and have always been a highly suspicious man. I trust nobody, not even those who seem to all outward appearance, the most saintly, modern psycho twaddle would ascribe this to some traumatic incident in my infancy. But apart from the time my part emptied my post office savings account and fled to Uruguay with his floozy, and the other time when my mom sold me to a traveling Brut, mine was a blissful childhood. No, my lack of trust in humanity, and I should add in the animal kingdom, is simply a character trait, like having a sweet tooth, or a punch wrong for fighting bears. That being so I employ three facto Thai, the first to make an announcement, the second to corroborate it, and the third to deploy the coup de gras, which in the present case was to usher the nuncio into my presence to make the provisional visible. It's a happy arrangement, and I make it happier still by rotating the duties of the three facto tie Ned, Ned, and Ned, so none has the opportunity to relax into his role and thus have the opportunity for Maleficent scheming against me. dismissing the Ned with my usual lordly if somewhat ephemera that wave of the hand, I cast an eye over my visitor. He was horribly disfigured. Indeed, for a moment, I thought he must have come into my chambers straight from one of Mr. lovecrafts purple passages. But then I recalled that Lovecraft works of fictions and that his characters have no reality independent of the page. I dabbed at my lips with a napkin, and asked the nuncio to state his business, such as his disfigurement that he was unable to speak coherently. His mouth was all twisted and scrunched, and though I could tell he was a man of high breathing and delicate sensibilities, the noises he made were incomprehensible. They were also deafeningly loud, and I had to tear my napkin into and stuff each half into my ears. The sudden contact of recently deposited spittle, fabric and earwax set off a chemical reaction, and the resulting compound seeped into the inside of my head, wormed its way towards my brain, and was eventually to fell me on the spot. But it would take some time to do so. And I was oblivious of my fight. So I continued my interrogation of the nuncio. I explained to him that I could not understand a word he was saying, or rather, grunting my own voice is a mellifluous instrument By the way, and one which often has the ladies swooning. It surprised me that it had the same effect on the nuncio, who suddenly crumpled to the floor and lay seemingly lifeless upon the linoleum.

Frank Key  04:23
I tinkle the bell and my factoty appeared within seconds. No doubt they'd been lurking behind the door and listening out for every word, eager to hear something they might later use to undermine me. My first instinct was to punish their in imminent treachery by sending them to the brute for a battering up. But then it occurred to me if I had been unable to make head nor tail of the nuncio, strangulated grunts. Was it likely that Ned or Ned or Ned would have been able to decipher them from behind the door panel? Like my question Event my hearing is exquisite. Whereas at least one factotum was deaf as a post and the other two were brain sick. I decided to withhold the threat of the brute for the time being, and instead, I commanded one of the nodes to rifle through the non CEOs pockets. This stage, I was still under the impression that he was an emissary from the Vatican, and I wanted to know which Cardinal had sent him. That would give me some idea how to proceed, for I could split the Cardinals into two distinct camps. There were those of whom I was petrified. And there were those who supplied me with the bones of long dead saints. Sometimes, the latter group would offer me other non osseous relics, but these were of no interest to me. I'm a bones man through and through. As soon as the factotum was done rummaging, it became clear that the nuncio had no connection with either set of Cardinals. In fact, it was doubtful if he was even a Roman Catholic. What came out of his pocket was a hetero Clyde and rather sordid jumble of bitty bolts, buttons string a snapped elastic band, one or two dead Beatles cake crumbs and identifiable muck, a shower bank ticket, a butcher's pencil, dust filth, tiny rubber shred, a semi sucked cough drop, blotting paper, a hairball instant gravy granules, a bent safety pin and several pips. There was no trace of identification whatsoever. nor was there only money nor a set of keys nor cart to visit. This nuncio was either an enigma, or a vagabond, perhaps both. So I told the factoty to give him a good kicking.

Frank Key  06:56
amancio is of course a messenger from the Latin nuncius. It was possible he had been trying to deliver his message verbally before he swooned, but it seemed unlikely etiquette would suggest he had been greeting me using all my honorific titles. There was nothing in his pocket resembling a written communique, unless I was meant to interpret the blocks on the blotting paper. Then I remembered that long ago was it in ancient Rome, a slave would have his head shaved an important message tattooed upon his scalp, and then once his hair had grown back, he would be sent scampering in his toga across the hills and plains, appearing to naive gods and centuries as just another hiking Roman slave until he reached his destination, where upon his head would again be shaved, and his top secret method successfully delivered, but I'm not naive, I'm suspicious. I told one of the needs to go and fetch the garden shears. Halfway through this haircut, the nuncio woke woke from his swoon, and his kicking and within human strength, he flung my factotum across the chamber, the shares were clattering across the linoleum. I thought the new lopsided arrangement of his Buffon rather suited his other disfigurements, and was about to say so, but I didn't want him swooning on me again. The patches of his head, which were now bed had not after all been tattooed, where I wondered, was my message. As well as being suspicious, I'm impatient. Before the nuncio had even scrambled to his feet. I was throwing a fit of petulance, the fact totai. Coward behind an heiress, for they knew just how dangerous this could be. kingdoms have crumbled, our models have sank, birds have fallen dead out of the sky, when I have one of my tantrums. Oddly, the nuncio didn't bat an eyelid. Although given his disfigurement, it was difficult to tell if those I'm batting flaps of blotchy, withered flesh, actually were his eyelids. Instead, he minced towards me and snapped his fingers in front of my face. Throughout my gorgeous pampered life, I have always been resistant to hypnotists. Christ knows they tried marshaling a panoply of techniques to send me under, but I merely thumbed my nose at them, just as I have thumbed my nose at death itself on many an occasion. But where so many charlatans had failed, the nuncio seemed to know what he was doing, because as soon as I heard that finger snap, I was away with the cuckoos. I mean, that literally, I was hunched, or at least I thought I was hunched on a high tree branch of poplar tree, leaning against a nest in which a mother cuckoo was regurgitating grubs and beetles into the quivering upturned gullet of it young. The palace the fantastic draperies of my chamber by divan, my facto tie, the nuncio himself all had vanished. I quickly ran a hand over my face to check that I had not grown a beak. But no, I was still recognizably human, though shrunk, it seemed to the size of a bird. I took a careful look at the Cuckoo's that was when I heard another snap, and I was back in my chamber sprawled on the divan, and mercifully much bigger than a bird. Everything was back to normal, more or less. The nuncio was now leaning against the mantle piece I noticed tapping at some sort of handheld Bakelite gubbins with a little pointy problem, his brow is furrowed and concentration, unless I was misinterpreting his disfigurement. My factoty however, were behaving rather curiously even for them. They had bunched up together in a corner, having surrounded themselves with twigs and other tree lopping, and all three of them had craning their necks, so they were staring at the ceiling and their mouths were open, and they were quivering. They looked unnervingly like the baby cocoons in my hallucination though bigger and grubbier. Just then the nuncio stopped tapping and his contraction spat out a small cardboard rectangle, which he handed to me. a surprising amount of text had been printed upon what I took to be some kind of invoice. But then invoice for what the nuncio was standing there expectantly, clearly waiting for me to read it. So I did.

Frank Key  11:50
invoice it said, for services provided to printful in 2001 mesmeric intervention to supply a ladder out of a moral quagmire. payment in full. It's now June, groats and florens accepted. You have been served today by linbit. They follow the price which was ridiculous. allied to my suspicious nature and my impatience is a tendency to bluster. boy did I bluster there was nothing on the invoice to say for whom Lembit to the disfigured nuncio was working. So I jumped to the immediate conclusion that he was merely a chancer, who had fetched up at the palace and thought he could pull a fast one. No doubt he had heard the countryside rumors about how I created my facto tie with willful cruelty and contempt and thought by his hypnotic flummery, he could turn me into a wishy washy, do gooder a mother cookoo nurturing its chicks. Well, he and Ned and Ned and Ned would soon learn I was grimmer, fiercer and more vengeful, and they supposed that was pretty much the gist of what I shouted at the nuncio in my blustery way. I may have added something about being perfectly happy wallowing in a moral quagmire, if that was indeed where I was, because it looked like a bloody fantastic quagmire to me what with its crenellations and draperies and my divan, and my many and various palatial accoutrements, Mr. Anyway, my loud bluster seemed to do the trick for the nuncio detached himself from the mental piece where he was again leaning insolently and minced away out of the door. Before he vanished entirely However, he flailing his arms in a haphazard, yet strangely significant manner. And I found myself gazing over at the fact totai there gullets still up turned, and look some mercy, a tear came to my eye. Without knowing quite what I was doing, I went off to the biggest and most well stocked of my many, many pantries, and returned with a hamper full of toothsome snacks. As if I were a large, ungainly mother, cookoo clad in Raymond fine. I dropped toffees and bums and bite sized choco flakes and anchovies and gobstoppers and marinated tofu chunks and processed cheese triangles and custard balls and all sorts of other treats down the quivering throat of my fac totai. When they were sighted, I cracked open a bottle of air rated lettuce water and poured them each a beaker full. I sobbed as I saw smiles breakout on their pockmarked faces. Then I took them out on a Sherif bank excursion. We visited the mysterious piles of scum near sawdust bridge, the bottomless Viper pit shrubbery ness, the Old tower of Lebanon and the yeast deposits near Pepin stone. We paused for a picnic in a field splattered with buttercups, in which cows roamed stupid yet elegant. I took them to say a performance of binders Sonata for clarinet and tangerine pips, and then we hiked over some mountains until we reached the Erie Barnett screwed hunahpu farmyard. dusk was falling. So we called into a kiosk and I bought Ned and Ned cardigans, and a duffle coat for Ned, and our Magneto torch each so that they could light their way home. I must each of them on their filthy locks, and promised them stylish haircuts at a new modern barbers. When we got back to the palace, tired but happy, I presented them with brand new mattresses and either downs and even pillows before kissing them. Good night. I've read them a story about a bad, evil princeling, who wallowed in a moral quagmire, but who saw the error of his ways, and clambered out of the quagmire on a ladder, and how he handed the keys to his palace to his facto tie, and spent the rest of his life atoning for his sins by tending to the sick, and the indigent and the frankly unspeakable. Before I settled down for the night on the cold stone

floor of the smallest and most cramped of my many, many pantries, I went to count the groats and floorings in my casket, I opened the lid and found the empty, safer a small cardboard rectangle. It was a receipt, and it was signed by Lembit, the disfigured nuncio, and there was a diagram on it of his arms being flailed in a haphazard, yet strangely significant manner. But before I could scream with fury, the admixture of spittle and fabric and earwax when fears inside my head, and my brain exploded.

Frank Key  17:33
Now, what might be a first on British or even World Radio, what we're going to do is in the studio is reenact a dream I had and broadcast it over the air. This is the entirety of a dream. It's a verbatim transcript of the dialogue from the dream. And you can tell you know, you can you can trust me that it's guaranteed verbatim transcript because as soon as I woke up from this dream, I wrote it down. And there are two characters, one of them is me. And the other one is a boffin. And in order to do this exciting reenactment of the dream, I'm going to be playing the boffin and the part of me will be played by track gavel tramp, who's here beside me, who's actually spent some months rehearsing for this role. So yeah, a dream world broadcast as it happened. How fantastic is that? So here it goes. Remember on playing the buffin and track is is playing me. So here we go. You do realize that the entire human brain could be recreated in the lab from a single cell of a Finch? Would that be an attractive little Finch like the Siskin? Sadly, no.

Frank Key  19:27
Wasn't that fantastic? That was a genuine dream that I had. Nothing else happened actually, me and a boffin. And that was the dialogue that we had. So let's move on. banished to a remote at all. I subsisted on mollusks and rainwater. It was my own fault. I had been issued with one of the new style anti social behavior orders. Now I would have many long years to reflect upon the consequences of brazenly smoking a cigarette at a bus stop. past which an endless parade of vehicles belch noxious fumes. It was, as they say, a fair cop Gov. I readily placed my wrists into the manacles presented by the community patrol invigilation cadet, as I lay sprawled in the gutter following a salutary tasering my weekend a befouled Hulk anchored off the seaside was an enormous help. I was able, for the first time to acknowledge the depths of my criminality, I can say without dissembling, that I positively enjoyed the sensation of being tossed out of an aeroplane and descending with the aid of an automatically opening parachute, which I have since ripped up for bedding linen onto my at all. For it is now very, very much my at all where I subsist upon mollusks and rainwater and my rapidly dwindling carton of tipped full strength Paraguayans cigarettes.

Here is another story. This one begins with a quote from a song, which you may recognize, and buried somewhere in the text is a quote from another song, which you may recognize. There are no prizes, but if you recognize either of the songs, send an email to hooting yard. And let me know this is how I tell you the title. But anyway, here we go. Lend me your ear while I call you a fool. You were kissed by a witch One Night in the Woods. Well, you thought it was a witch. But actually it was the Whoo hoo hoo. Woman, broadly similar to but not exactly a witch. She kissed you there in the woods in the night. And then she turned into a crow and flew away. You did not see where to, for it was so dark in the woods. What were you doing there so late, you ought to have been tucked up in bed in your crumbling chamber on the topmost floor of a large hall. But for reasons known only to yourself, you could set your pig shaped alarm clock for half past two in the morning, and you woke and dressed in Gordy Raymond, and stocked down the servants staircase, and out of the pantry door and along the lane. And when you reach the edge of the woods, you pressed on, not stopping, though the trees grew denser and denser, until you met with the Whoo hoo hoo, the woman she kissed you and turned into a CRO, but you were not transformed. You stay just as you were a fool in the middle of the woods, in the middle of the night.

Frank Key  22:58
Did you expect that you too would become a CRO or some other bird, a linate or a partridge? And had you done so? What then? Did you think you could beat your wings and fly and follow what you thought was a wick to where she perched in the form of a crow upon the sturdy branch of an oak tree. Remember that many of the trees in the woods smeared with bird line and you might have become stuck, waiting helplessly for dawn to break and for the hunting men to come and break your neck and stuff you into a sack. You need Have no fear that such a fate will befall the Whoo hoo hoo, woman. For long before morning. She will transform herself again from a crow into a squirrel or a gnat and she will have no trouble sticking herself from the bird line for she will use her powers. Perhaps you thought that with one kiss from her, you would be granted those powers. full, full fool. That's not how it works, and never has been. And you would know that if you had read your storybooks carefully. As it is you were left alone in the woods in the dark kissed but I'm transformed if anything more foolish than you had been before. What then you wondered? Did the kiss portend and why had the wick in truth the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman turned into a crow and flown away from you. Did she want you to seek her to blunder about in the dark woods trying to find her perk to clamber up the trunk of the oak and join her there in your foolish still human form? Or did she intend that you turn back once kissed turned back and try drawing along the line back to slide tool to climb back up the stairs and enter your upper chamber and into your bed and fall asleep and remember nothing. Being a fool you do not know which choice to make. So you simply stand there in the middle of the would suddenly above shifting clouds reveal the moon the cold hearted orb that rules the night through a gap in the dense leafy edge of oaks and Sycamores and pines, a shaft of silver light beams down upon you. It lights up the mark on your forehead, the Crimson mark where you were kissed by the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. You will not see it until morning when hearing the boots of the hunting men crunching through the Duff you gather what pour which you have and walk out of the woods, not back to slide Hall, but out the other side towards the pond, the pond, you stoop to see your reflection in the water. You see that head of a fall bearing the mark of the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman. It is in eradicable and swans paddle across the pond towards you dozens of swans, the mark on your forehead begins to glow. It grows hot until it is burning bright, and you see it reflected in the eyes of the swans. They surround you now white and silent as you slumped to your knees at the edge of the pond. They will never let you leave them. You belong to them now. They worship you with the fanaticism only swans are capable of you were still a fool, but have a new uncanny type. And as the swans gaze at you and blinking you hear the coin of a crow somewhere in the sky above. And you feel a sharp Pang in your forehead where you were kissed by the Whoo hoo Dee woman at Night in the Woods

Frank Key  26:52
believe that at the very end I mispronounced Whoo hoo hoo Dee woman as Whoo hoo really woman or something? I got it wrong, which is most annoying. But nevermind. And we'll move on with a quotation from a book 109 year old book published in 1900. by Benjamin Taylor called story ology, essays in folklore, see law and plant law. And then human Tyler writes, there is one must admit a certain association of vulgarity with the onion is is a valuable food and an indispensable accessory to the color nary artist, but as used by many people, it is not suggestive of refinement. And yet the bulb has not only an honorable character, it has a sort of sacred history. Both clingy and juvenile among old writers, and many Egyptologist of our own time and country have recorded that the ancient Egyptians worshiped the onion. It is true that Wilkinson, who wrote on the manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians doubts the evidence of this, but he adds that the onion was admitted as a common offering on every altar, and that the priests were forbidden to eat it. In Ellis's history of Madagascar. It is noted that the Malagasy of our time regard the onion as unclean and forbidden by the idols. For bidding it may be but the onion can be a weapon in the fight against crime, because Benjamin Taylor goes on to say, Ovid says that both onions and sulfur were given to criminals to purify them from their crimes upon the old theory of purgation by fumigation. And with that, thought, I shall leave you many thanks to track gravel gavel tramp for joining me on this week's show playing the part of me in a broadcasting first, and I won't be back next week because it's the frieze Art Fair. So I'll be back in two weeks. Bye bye.
