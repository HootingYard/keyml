It is indeed hooting yard. And I'm Frankie, and I'm going to repeat. I was recently described somewhere as a dire gymnasium recluse. So I was planning to broadcast this show from a barrel. But I didn't manage to get the barrel sorted out in time, maybe next week. Every so often, I received letters from listeners asking for background information on particular features of hooting yard. My usual practice is to ignore such inquiries and stuffed them into a cardboard box and to shove the cardboard box into a dark cranny but sometimes I feel impelled to shine a torch into the cranny to rummage in the cardboard box to take out one among the moldering scraps of paper and to give it drew attention. There's no particular method in my choosing. Though a letter written neatly and grammatically on scented note paper headed with a heraldic device. However, spurious is likely to win out over a scribble on a torn bit of breakfast cereal cartons stained with grease. You might want to make a note of that in your pocketbook for future reference. Elsewhere I will provide some tips on drawing spurious yet strangely compelling heraldic devices for your letterhead. But there is no time for that now. Anyway, the letter I have just retrieved from the cranny is pithy, even Curt. Boy, Mr. Key, it says, How did the cow and pins get its name? And that's it. It's not even signed. But the handwriting is exquisite and done in most ink on lime green tissue paper scented with bergamot or what smells like burger marks to my untrained nostrils. And there is a simply fabulous hand drawn heraldic device now somewhat faded for God knows how long the letters been squirreled away, in which I can make out a category rampant, a snow shovel and six buttons Google's listeners will recall I hope that the cow on pins is the finest Tavern in existence, or beer something of a hellhole when a sink of advice. It's many long years since I sat in it snug. But if I shut my eyes and concentrate, I can imagine myself there in the gloom. With that telltale sense of befuddlement and the way in which yet again, a scattering of sawdust from the floor is floating atop the froth of my pint. Such dejection in the fog. One of the reasons this letter would have been consigned to the cranny is on Barrett and I am embarrassed to say that I have absolutely no idea why the cow and pins is called the cow and pinned. The best I can do now is to repeat the story I heard from an old bloated barnyard behemoth, with whom I used to sit sometimes an evening at the bench outside the tavern, tossing breadcrumbs to crows under a thunderous sky. He told me that the weird woman of Whoo hoo dee whoopty Woo, once took a dislike to a certain cow that chewed the foxgloves or lupins she grew in flowerpots outside her cave. how or why this cow wandered away from its fellows was not explained. It may even have been different cows on different days. That weird woman over Whoo hoo de whoopty woo was celebrated and feared for her spooky eldritch powers, but no one ever claimed that she had great expertise in farmyard animal identification skills. Be that as it may, she satisfied herself that a single cow was causing the depredation of her foxgloves or possibly loopings and reacted in a tiresomely predictable way. That's right, she cast a spell on the cow. What else would you expect of the weird woman of Whoo hoo dee whoopty Woo. She gathered much wax and molded it into an effigy of a cow, double the size of any cow that ever lived and stuck it with thousands of pins from her big crate of cursed pins. Then she babbled imprecations and incantations in her usual harsh hissing way. We do not know if any calamity befell the cow or cows as a result, but according to the old bloated barnyard behemoth the tavern outside which we sat chucking breadcrumbs to crows was built over the field where once the cows had grazed

I'm not convinced by this story. It would make more sense to me if the tavern was on the spot where the weird woman of Whoo hoo dee wudi, Wu's flowerpots had stood bursting with Fox gloves or loopings in serried ranks outside her cave. In the absence of any other explanation, however, it will have to do and now I can put the letter back in the cardboard box in the dark cranny and forget about it forever, forever and ever. Amen.

Is it behemoth or better mouth? I've never really known. I usually say bad mouth, but suddenly I thought it might be behemoth. Anyway, if anyone would like to write in and put me right on the pronunciation of that word I'd be most grateful. The address is hooting dot yard at Google mail.com. And, and or you could leave a comment if you'd like on the website at www dot hooting yard.org regular readers will know that over the last couple of weeks I've had something of a writer's block nothing quite as dramatic as I but I haven't been writing as much as as normal. And I must admit to being perplexed at my uninspired state. I've been tapping the keyboard in a desultory way before abandoning the few lines of guff that result, or more commonly in recent days feeling a reluctance even to begin tapping. And the reason I'm puzzled is that much of my reading at the moment is of a writer who might find fantastically inspiring. I decided to immerse myself in the eight volumes of fours clavin Gera, after coming across guide, Davenport's lament that nowadays, hardly anyone ever reads john Ruskin? Well, I'd never read him. And I thought I'd have to fight my way through these 96 letters to the workmen and labors of Great Britain, one each month for eight years from 1871 to 1878. Thinking that the reading would be would be a challenge rather than a pleasure. Ah, but what a pleasure lay in store for me and still does. I've read six of the eight volumes so far. Ruskin is a magnificent writer, not least in his ability to veer off unexpected angles. One minute he'll be ranting about the iniquities of industrialization, then he'll launch into a transcription of what he readily admits is a really dull folk story about Swiss peasants, before reminding himself that all the time he meant to write about glassier theory. If only the Reverend James mccosh were here, begins one paragraph for no apparent reason. I adore the surprise and the sheer ease of his prose. You can sense the workings of the gigantic and eccentric Ruskin brain as he flips from topic to topic, but somehow never quite gets lost. He writes about barging into someone's cottage to wish a happy new year to whoever was there has some thoughts on the proper education of children, and suddenly embarks on a sustained passage about the nature of bees. What he does and doesn't know about them, and pauses to rummage among his bookcases. Looking up be information in Bingley QSL, Petr Galpin, and Alma road the latter's history of wasps, Ruskin decides, ought to be a standard book in the primary education of girls. Am I so austrac by Ruskin that his prose intimidates rather than inspires me? I don't think that's the case. Anyway, I have regular fads and enthusiasms for writers. I once read about a dozen novels by Vladimir Boucle, one after another in a frenzy with no ill effects. So I shall remain vaguely perplexed by my lack of inspiration. But I try my best to start tapping away again with bluster and vim. And if all else fails, I'll just have to summon the Phantom of the Reverend James mccosh from out of the shadows.

Actually, I think heating yard readers of the website are getting a bit bored of my obsession with them. roschin and so I've decided I'm not going to say or write any more about him. However, before saying farewell. I think it would be a really good idea to read this passage from I think this is from letter number 69 which is yes, this is from letter 69 which is titled The message of jL acro pulse for 1876. And it's, it's a pattern where he doesn't veer off into other subjects. And I'll let it stand as it is. This is Ruskin from 133 years ago. I had driven from Brentwood in early morning down the valley of the creek and took a train first at the alvaston station, settling myself in the corner of the carriage next to see for better prospect there off. In the other corner was a respectable, stolid middle aged man reading his paper. I had left my Coniston lake in dashing ripples under a south wind thick with rain. But the tide lay smooth and silent along the sands, melancholy in absolute paws of motion, nor ebb nor flow distinguishable here and there among the shelves of gray shore, a little ruffling of their apparent pools marked stray threadings of river current. At Grange talking loud, got into young Cox comes, who reclined themselves on the opposite cushions, one had a thin stick with which in a kind of sent vitesses dance, partly affectation of nonchalance, partly real fever produced by the intolerable idleness of his mind and body. he rapped on the elbow of his seat, poked the button the holes of the windows strap and switched his boots or the air all the way from Grange to the last station before can fourth, he and his friend talking a yacht and regatta listlessly. The sudden, vitesses Meantime, dancing, one expressing his opinion that quote, the most dangerous thing to do on these lakes was going before the wind, and quote, The respectable man went on reading his paper without notice of them. None of the three ever looked out of the windows at sea or shore, there was not much to look at, indeed, through the driving and gradually closer driven rain, except the drifting about of the seagulls and their quiet dropping into the pools. their wings kept open for an instant to where breasts felt the water well, then closing their petals of white light, like suddenly shot water flowers. The two regatta men got out in drenching rain on the coverless platform at the station before can fourth, and all the rest of us at can fourth itself to wait for the up train. The shade on the upline even there is small, in which a crowd of third class passengers were packed close by the outside drip. I did not see one out of some 25 or 30 persons tidally dressed nor one with a contented and serenely patient look, lines of care of mean hardship of comfortless submission of knowing of knowing anxiety, or ill temper characterized every face. The train came up and my poor companions were shuffled into it speedily in heaps. I found that empty first class carriage for myself, wondering how long universal suffrage would allow itself to be packed away in heaps for my convenience. At Lancaster, I father and daughter got in, presumably commercial, Father stoutly built and firm featured sagacious and cool. The girl hard and common, well dressed except that her hat was cocked. Too high on her hair. They both read papers all the way to Warrington. I was not myself employed much better, the incessant rain making the windows and their wilderness of dirty dribbling. And neither Preston nor Wigan presenting anything lively to behold, I had settled myself to Mrs. Brown on spelling bees, an unusually forced and poor number of Mrs. Brown by the way.

I have to change at Warrington for Chester the weather better than little while I got a cup of tea and a slice of bread in the small refreshment room. contemplating the while in front of me, the panel's have painted glass on it swinging doors, which represented to troubadours in broadly striped blue and yellow breeches, purple jacket and plumed caps with golden hilted swords and enormous liars. Both had soft curled mustaches, languishing eyes, open mouths, and faultless legs. Meanwhile, lounged at the corner behind me, much bemused in beer, a perfect example of the special type of useful blackguard. Now developing generally in England, more or less Brackley, porpoise, and swollen in all the features, and with mingle the expression of intense greatness and intense impedance, half pig, half jack door that got in with me when the train was ready, a middle class person of commercial traveler aspect, who had possessed himself of a graphic from the newsboy and who might presently forgot in examining the country on a line new to me, which became quickly under gleams of broken sunlight of extreme interest, as your green fields of deep corn undulations of sandstone Hill, with here and there a broken crag at the edge of a cutting. Presently the far glittering of the Solway like sands of D, and rounded waves of the Welsh hills on the southern horizon, from the landscape more fresh and fair than I have seen for many a day from any great line of English rail. When I looked back to my fellow traveler, he was sprawling all his legs on the cushion of the back seat with his boots on his graphic, not to save the cushions assuredly, but in the foul modern carelessness of everything which we have done with for the moment, his face clouded with solemn thought of a person helplessly in difficulty, and not able to give up thinking how to avoid the unavoidable. In a minute or two more, I found myself plunged into the general dissolution and whirlpool of porters, passengers and crock boned trucks running round corners against one's legs of the great Chester station. A simply dressed up a class girl of 16 or 17, strictly and swiftly piloting her little sister through the populace was the first human creature I had yet seen on whom site could rest without pain. The rest of the crowd was a mere dismal fermentation of the ignominious the trying to ruin a barn was crowded, and I was obliged to get into a carriage with to cadaverous sexagenarian spinsters, who'd been keeping the windows up all but a chink, for fear a drop of rain or breath of south wind should come in. And we're breathing the richest compound of products of their own indigestion. Pretending to be anxious about the construction of the train. I got the father window down and my body well out of it, then put it only halfway up when the train left and kept putting my head out without my hat. So as if possible to impress my fellow passengers with the imminence of a collision, which could only be averted by extreme watchfulness on my part, then requesting with all the politeness I could muster, to be allowed to move a box with which they had occupied the corner seat that I might sit face to the air. I got them ashamed to ask that the window might be shut up again, but they have all the way into the opposite corner to make me understand how they suffered from the draft. Presently, they got out two bags of blue grapes and ate away unanimously availing themselves of my open window to throw out rolled up pips and skins. General change to my extreme relief as to theirs was again required at Ruabon affected by a screwing backwards and forwards for three quarters of an hour of characters, which one was expecting every five minutes To get into and which were puffed and pushed away again, the moment one opened a door with loud calls of stand back there. A group of half a dozen children from eight to 14. The girls all in straw hats with long hanging Scarlet ribbons were more or less pleasant to see Meanwhile, and sunshine through the puffs of petulant and cross purposes steam promised a pleasant run to Llangollen.

I have only the conventional business man with a paper for this run, and on his leaving the carriage for Llangollen was just closing the door thinking to have both windows at command when my hand was stayed by the father of a family of four children, who, with their mother and aren't presently filled the carriage, the children fitting or scrambling in anywhere with expansive kicks and lively struggles. They belong to the lower middle class, the mother, an idea of the worthy commonplace, evidently hard put to it to make both ends meet and wholly occupied in family concerns. Her face fixed in the ignoble gravity of virtuous persons, to whom their own troublesome households have become monasteries. The Father, slightly more conscious of external things, submitting benevolently to his domestic happiness out on its annual holiday, the children ugly, fidgety and Ill bred, but not unintelligent, full of questionings. When they were to get here or there, how many rails there were on the line, which side the station was on, and who was to meet them. In such debate, varied by bodily contortions in every direction, they contrive to pass the half hour, which took us through the veil of Llangollen past some of the loveliest broken Glen's scenery in the world. But neither the man the woman, nor any one of the children looked out of the window once the whole way. They got out at Corwin leaving me to myself for the run past Bala lake and down the dole galley Valley, but more sorrowful than of late has been my want, in the sense of my total isolation from the thoughts and ways of the present English people. For I was perfectly certain that among all the crowd of living creatures who might have that day seen Scarlet ribbons and all, there was not one to whom I could have spoken a word on any subject interesting to me, which would have been intelligible to them. But the first broad sum of fact, for the sake of wit, drive given this diary is among certainly not less than some seven or 800 people seen by me in the course of this day, I saw not one happy face, and several hundreds of entirely miserable ones. The second broad sum of fact, is that out of the few not happy, but more or less spirited and complacent faces I saw among the lower and the mercantile classes, what life or spirit they had depended on a peculiar caulk on a downhill character of impedance, which meant a total inability to conceive any good or lovely thing in this world or any other. And the third, some of fact, is that in this rich England, I saw only eight out of 800 persons gracefully dressed and decently mannered. JOHN Ruskin on a train or change a few details Frankie on a bus.

And finally this week, probably Finally, yeah, given the time, and here's a piece called hospital barge. dotted along the entire length of the canal, there are villages and hamlets. It said that most have been sites of human settlements for thousands of years, which is a bit perplexing as the canal itself was only dug two centuries ago. The hospital barge plies up and down the canal constantly turning when it gets to mud birth and leading straight back to MCC field. never stopping except at locks. There are many locks. One of the villager or Hamlet here is sick their cart into the canal side by their neighbors. hauled aboard the boss hospital barge by a steam powered crane and stretcher and pincer contraction. Once they have been cured, if they are cured, they dump to shore it the next village or Hamlet and have to make their own way home by land, unless as is common. They choose to remain in the village or Hamlet, where they have been dumped, and thus do the canal side communities intermingle. The hospital barges staffed by a gaggle of homeopaths and healers and fraudsters and quacks and the dispensary holds shelf after shelf packed with pointless potions such as Bach flower remedies, and Beethoven weed remedies and Brookner nettle remedies. There is not a single bottle of Baxters sour but invigorating syrup to be found, let alone any cranial integuments soothers or anti biotics it's a wonder that any of the patients are ever cured, but in fairness, it must be said that those dumped assures a village or Hamlet miles up or down the canal from where they were winch to board the barge, show remarkable perkiness and in many cases appear to be immortal. In the village of filth wick, for example, no one has died in the last 60 years, and the gymnasium is filled with sprightly 150 year olds jumping about and springing and bouncing and hopping and somersaulting an otherwise engaging in decidedly energetic calisthenics. This being the canal along the towpath of which Dobson often trudged. The out of print pamphleteer could hardly resist writing about the hospital barge, but he wanted more than the view of a disinterested observer and waited to fall sick so he could go aboard the barge as a patient. Alas, Dobson had the Constitution of a large, sinewy, more or less rectangular animal with no known predators, and never suffered illness. He became impatient standing on the canal towpath, watching the hospital barge past him by occasionally witnessing the winching on an aid you'd wreck or the dumping of a revivified pointing Towner. Eventually, the pamphleteer could wait no longer, and he took the fateful step of injecting himself with an experimental serum concocted by one of his pals down at the cow and pins. The fitting hissing dappled, dumb fluid smell of rust and blood oranges, and was meant to called harmless shuttering with all the appearance of a death rattle in Dobson had an alarmingly different effect, in that it provoked a mental imbalance, making him petrified of boats and ships and yachts and barges. So much so that the sight of water even of a duck pond, he ran away screaming. a fortnight later when the serum wore off. Dobson learned through an article in the canalside Gazette, that the hospital barge had been rendered invisible. It and its crew of homeopaths and healers and fraudsters some cracks, and its onboard patients were never seen again, and no more than many many dead who had never been cured upon the barge, and whose final resting places are an unanswerable mystery.

And that's the end of this week's hooting yard on the air. I do hope you've enjoyed it. I promise never mentioned john Ruskin again. Until next time, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
