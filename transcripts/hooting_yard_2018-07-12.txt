Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And the end of last week's show. My special guest pansy cradle Jude promised that this week's show would begin with news of Anna Pavlova and her swan. So I feel duty bound even though pansies not not with us today, I feel duty bound to pass this information on. Although you may be a bit disappointed that the only information I have is that Anna Pavlova had a pet Swan named jack bats it is no more decisive. Anyway. Anyway, I've Sorry, I've come into possession of some information about the German secret agent Wiens. And the information I've received concerns his mop and his patter and his flip top of IDs and his submarine and his fixation and he's ink and his Piccolo and his other mop and his secrets. His mop wings out a blonde mop, sometimes tausend, sometimes flattened and primped and slathered in hair oil, which looked he chose depended on the mission he was undertaking. Where a mission called for 1000 mop, he towels all these mop. If it was thought prudent to have his mop, flattened and primped and slathered in hair oil he flattened and printed and slathered in hair oil. There were occasions when no clear guidance was available with regard to his mop. Juanes would agonize up to the very last minute before embarking on the mission. Then he would either towel or flatten and print and slather in hair oil, according to what he described as his gut feelings. These feelings were not truly in his gut, but in his head, directly beneath his mob. They were co agitations of the brain rather than feelings. His pattern wings was a polyglot and could deliver his pattern in the tongues of many lands. The pattern was designed to disguise the his true identity as a German secret agent. If he unleashed his patter on you, you would think he was a chocolate switch role sales rep, or a trainer or budgerigars or a snippy man, depending on which patter he deployed. These were these three were by no means is only patters there were others, but they're given as a sample. His flip top lids for ease of access and retrieval of the things he kept in containers, winds insisted on those containers having flip top lids. He argued that the time it would take him to unscrew a screw top lid could prove critical and he would rather be and he would be better occupied doing something germane to his mission, rather than unscrewing the screw top lid. Several containers had to be modified by the boffins in the secret agency, a terrier wins like to personally test the modified lids when possible. But if he was engaged in a secret mission, and thus unable to visit the Atelier, he delegated the lid testing to a trusted minion. His submarine wings traveled from place to place in a submarine. It was his his It was his IQ, his center of operations. And he was the captain Weems knew every inch of its piping and every individual valve. He could move about the submarine blindfold and sometimes did just that to show off. He had a hand picked crew who idolized him. He also kept a budgerigar in a cage hanging from one of the overhead pipe. The budgerigars name with Simon Williams was blindfolded Simon as a prank, but the bird panicked and suffered heart palpitations and depression. was never repeated his fixation dangerously for a secret agent Weems had a Gwyneth Paltrow fixation.

He did not go so far as to stalk the actress. But we had a compulsion to hack into her website goop from the onboard computer on the submarine. For a long time, they managed to keep his fixation and his hacking hidden from his handlers. Until one day a keystroke mishap betrayed him. hailed before a hastily impaneled panel winds tried patter, it worked, and he pulled the wool over the eyes of the panel 10 eyes in all, one of glass. Lateral tro then subjected the onboard submarine computer to a viral attack, which seems to have Snowbird winds up. He's his ink. As a secret agent wings wrote all his communiques in invisible ink, he kept the ink in a small storage jar with a flip top lid. See above the ink being invisible, it was impossible to tell which jars contained ink and which were empty. Wings could have solved this problem by feeling the heft of each guy in his hand. But the ink was weightless as well as invisible. he devised a method of injecting the ink with dye made from crushed raspberries. This cools the ink to turn raspberry colored and that's visible. So before writing a communicate wave is pulled the ink from its small storage jar into a bigger storage jar, also with a flip top lid, and diluted it with sufficient water to render the Raspberry Pi so pale that to the unaided eye, it was as good as invisible. The water he obtained by surfacing in the submarine clambering out on deck and scooping up sea water women label is Piccolo. Weems was an accomplished Piccolo player, but had a limited repertoire. His playing become Simon the budgerigar see above, who seemed to enter a trance like state when listening note trance like so not quite a full trance. His other mob in addition to the mob have blonde hair on his head, winds kept in reserve another mob one affixed to the end of a wooden pole such as might be used by a janitor. Curiously, a janitor was not one of the disguised identities assumed backed up by patter, see above. Wiens had tried and failed and tried again and failed again to master the art of janitorial patter. Eventually he'd given up the ghost and unconvincing janitor was too risky a role and if I masked winds his usefulness his handlers would be at an end, he could not be put out to pasture or executed. He kept them up, however, in a cabin on the submarine and sometimes mop the decks with it. while blindfolded. There was there were lowly sub mariners among the crew, whose duties included mopping, but Weems was willing to muck in with menial tasks. This willingness was born of his sheer love of the submarine. A love that was boundless. It was sometimes said of Wiens that the team of psychiatrists could have a field day with him, but he was too canny and operator, Everett allow even a single psychiatrist anywhere near him. His secrets, never divulged his memoirs reveal nothing.

I didn't have a dog in the fight. I didn't have a dog full stop. And there wasn't a fight Exactly. It was more of a skirmish. One gang of warriors armed with sword charged screaming, screaming at another gang of warriors also armed with swords. There were one or two clans of blade against blade. But then the second gang ran away back to their bivouacked and the first gang still screaming their heads off, took possession of the area of land. on which the skirmish had taken place. It was not quite the land being more accurately described as sodden Marsh, but the warriors were well pleased with themselves. Their blood curdling screams turned to counting, and they counted their victory song, which went something like this. We have vanquished our foes, our swords are caked with their blood. Truly they have been ripped to shreds on the southern Marsh land is ours. That's a translation. In the original the lines rhyme and have a pleasing rhythmic flow. You will note, however, that it's not strictly accurate, the photos ran away before they could be ripped to shreds, and not a drop of blood was spilled. It remains true, however, that I didn't have a dog in the fight. It doesn't matter that I had no dog that there was no fight as such. The statement has its own inner coherence and logic. Would things have been different? If I did have a dog and there had been a fight? Let's imagine that instead of running away, the second gang of warriors splashing about in the sodden Marsh, we're determined to keep possession of it. When the first gang came charging at them screaming the second gang were not cowed and instead started hacking wild grip their attackers who hacked back sought clashed stabbings occurred, limb was whoa locked. There was much bloodshed by the time they finished fighting. Most of the Warriors on either side were either dead or splayed upon the southern Marsh groaning. Those who could still walk up right retreated. The southern Marsh remained disputed territory, which gang of warriors took possession of it would depend upon further fighting, perhaps tomorrow, after each side had had the chance to replenish their numbers. Meanwhile, what about me and my putative dog for the purposes of vividness versus bestow upon it a breed and a name is a jack Russell Terrier, and its name is Skippy. For even more vividness. Let's just posit to the Skippy is celebrated in song by the chorus of tinies they sing Skippy their carrier. Oh what a hound. What Kim scamper across the ground, be Southern Marshall Meadow skip these are jolly good fellow. That is not a translation, as you can probably tell by the rhyme in the first couplet and the half rhyme in the second. By the way, do not fret that the time is assembled to sing Skippy His praises are in any danger from the screaming sword wielding warriors. We shall place the tinies off to one side, safe behind some kind of barricade. In fact, that's where Skippy my putative dog is, and I am to plan explains why I don't have a dog Skippy in the fight. I would not want him to come to any harm if he existed. That is not out of any overwhelming love for dogs. For an actual fact, I detest and fear them, but because I like to think that if I did have a dog as a pet, I would do my best to protect it from bloodthirsty screaming warriors armed with swords. I would not be much of a dog owner would I? If I picked Skippy up and kept him over the barricade and commanded him to go and fetch a stick I threw into the clashing melee of warriors. Dogs can be very crusting, and the likelihood is Skippy would gaze at me adoringly and scamper unquestioningly into the southern Marsh, there to be torn to bits by the razor sharp blades of the fighting men. They might not stab Skippy purposely. But if he were caught up in the violence by going to retrieve the throne stick, he would almost certainly fall victim to what is known as collateral damage. So if I did have a dog in the fight, even peripherally or circumstantially, he would probably come to a bad end,

I would have to dictate the grieving tinies to whose hearts were filled to bursting with love and admiration for Skippy as attested by their song. Though his violent death was caused by the chaotic hacking of swords in a battle which has nothing to do with him. Nor with me, whose only action was to throw a stick for him to fetch the tinies might well blame me. They would see singing and turn on me with looks of reproach and accuracy. I'm not sure how I would go about locating them. I suppose I could promise I suppose I could produce another putative dog. Another jack Russell Terrier, also called Skippy, and by sleight of hand and misdirection pretend it was the same dog and bloodied and in one piece and alive, but where would I get such a dog quickly enough to convince the tinies All in all, I'm thankful that I did not have a dog in the fight. Without the dog, there would be no call for a chorus of tinies to sing its praises from behind the barricade. Nor for me to throw a stick into the middle of a mad tangle of crashing, screaming blood drenched warriors for the putative Dr. Fetch. And with no dead dog, the Chinese would not turn on me with a rage and wildness more terrible than an army with banners.

I heard distant booming Was it the sound of bombs or Britain's warfare ornithology? I decided I had to find out for there was a great deal of difference between the two as I'm sure you realize. If it was the boom of exploding bombs, and war had been declared, then it was no comfort to me that the boomers were distant today they might be but I was in no doubt that the marauding and rapacious folk having bombed land far away would advance and bomb ever closer to the agreeable foamboard where I lived until I bombed my own neighborhood and me in it unless I fled. paradoxical paradoxically, perhaps, before making the decision to flee, I would have to do the opposite, to approach the distant booms to discover if they were indeed the booms of bombs. If on the other hand, the boom is where the booms of Britons, I would have no need to flee, I could return happily to my faubourg without a care in the world. If anything, I would be happier than before having learned of the presence of bitterns, albeit distant Pitons. If there were buttons, I reasoned, there would be a lake or similar body of water. There are a few things I like better than to go planning about up to my knees and I like plunging my hands into the water now and again, with scarcely credible Rapid City to pluck out fish for my dinner. It is a skill I learned at my mother's knee. She had studied the southern darting movements of certain insects, and learned through long hard practice to imitate them. All I had to do with equally long hard practice was to imitate her. Surely, you might ask, given my predilections, I would know of the existence of a like albeit a distant one. It's a reasonable question. All I can say by way of explanation is that I had never before heard booms, booms that might be those of Britain's from that direction, Northwest, by the way, to which I would add that there has been a flurry of artificial lake and pond construction all across the land of light. The king is keen on bodies of water and dreams of a land riddled with them, some of Josh that if he gets his way, there would be more water than land, just little ribbons and yachts, dotted Higgledy Piggledy in a great network of ponds and lakes, connected by canals. But the king is also a bellicose fellow with a seething hatred of you name it is the rest of hatreds is long, and includes the neighboring land, their kings and queens and armies and civilian populations. So it would be no surprise if the booms I heard were the booms of bombs. The King might well have declared war almost as an afterthought, or aside, or one on one of his shouty declarations from his balcony he could have led a neighbor to do To declare war on him, which by extension means us and me. Given the tape given the king's twin obsessions, I judged that the probability of the bonds the boom has been bombs or Britain's was about 5050. This was in the absence of any other information. My photo is quite an isolated one. And we're often the last day any news of national import. Last time there was a war for example, we only found out about it when they were pitched battles in the streets between our side and the marauding and rapacious foe. The foe hadn't had not made use of bombs. They were somewhat primitive barbarians armed with cutlasses and catapults. Nor do we tend to get news of the kings latest like creation schemes. Generally what happens is that the plans are made in his chamber by Him alone, and then the bulldozers move in and villages are destroyed and a huge pit dug into which unimaginable gallons of water are poured. fish and birds follow drawn by nature. Either the next week or so I made preparations for my journey. I put my phobal affairs in order as best I could and prepared an enormous number of sandwiches. Then these I swapped I wrapped in greaseproof paper I bought at a discount several multi packs of squelch.

I attached the odd hole in my NetWare and had my hiking boots renovated by the best hiking boot renovator in the faubourg. I mentioned these things to demonstrate that I was serious in my endeavor, not only a flibbertigibbet, disconcerting disconcerted by distant booms. All the while I could not help noticing that those distant booms were growing louder, and thus I reasoned closer. This will tend to tip the balance in favor of the booming of bombs. But there was no nothing, no level of fanaticism to which the king might take his body of water building activities. So there was still a fair chance that the booming was the booming of Britons. There came a day when I had nearly finished putting my affairs in order and had packed most of my supplies. By now, the booms were so loud and so close, that I began to doubt I would need to go investigating a tool. So unlikely now was the prospect of my journey that I tucked into several of the sandwiches and drank two cans of squelch Oh, no sooner had I shoved the crumpled greaseproof paper in the crushed cans down my waist shoot. The bomb crashed through the ceiling. It landed on my rug and made a ticking noise. I reasoned that I had mere seconds to dash as far away as possible before exploded with a boom. At least I thought I know now the provenance of the boons but as I made for the front door ready to Scarpa, my ears were assailed by a deafening boom. dizzy with panic. I pirouetted around and around like a man who has lost his senses. I was utterly befuddled that my chalet still stood solid and safe and agreeable, apart from the gaping hole in the ceiling. And then, as I peered out into the front garden, I saw a flock of Britons come to mind next to my garden puddle, and they were booming, booming, booming.

So there's three stories for you, or reports of things wins the German secret agent and what happens when you don't have a dog in the fight. And lastly, booming, have other bombs or buttons, and I'll end this week show I told you already about Anna Pavlova, having a pet Swan called jack. Here is a mother, Biffy Bob's from Mr. Keys shorter potted brief, brief lives. Hopefully you will find these slightly more interesting than Anna Pavlova Swan Robert Townson Which Bishop 1575 to 1621. Townson, who attended so Walter rally at his execution had a pet frog called Lucy Dora, which he kept to guard his desert his desert from flies. So he get like caked and custards and whatever to do people ate for dessert. And in order to keep the flies off it is Bishop out of pet frog and Anthony Trollope English right up 1815 to 1882 trollops reputation as a bad tempered bullying semi unhinged maniac. With such as his first meeting with his publishers, Chapman and Hall, Edward Chapman kept a firm grasp on a poker throughout the interview, as a precaution trollop demeanor may impart have been caused by the fact that throughout his life, he was haunted by the unjust accusation made when he was a pupil at Sunbury school that he had engaged in, quote, some nameless horror, unquote, with four other boys. I'm not aware of whether or not HP Lovecraft taught at this school. But there was some nameless horror of Antony cross Trollope may or may not have engaged in and Leon Trotsky, the Russian revolutionary 1879 to 1940. It's quite interesting, this Trotsky first max darling in a house on Whitechapel road in the East End of London. And on the site today is a McDonald's restaurant. So if you go to the McDonald's on Whitechapel road, I think it's quite nearby and near near the art gallery. And you look at the building. That is where Trotsky first Max starlin there's a thought, isn't it? And I think that's it for this week. I'm going to take off my super duper magnifying glasses, which allow me to read but which when I'm not reading, I can't see a damn thing. That times eight magnification. And the the most magnification you can get if you get generic reading specs in a supermarket. It's three times three. So imagine how powerful these these glasses are. Oh, In other news, the hooting od website which has been capote for months, with all sorts of Gremlins going on and horrible things happening if you click on anything, many, many thanks to Salim Fadhley and also in faraway New Zealand grim Webster, the two boffins who deal with these things for me and hooting out is now back up. working fine as far as I'm aware, no Gremlins. So do pay a visit hooting yard.org I think yeah, that's the address looting our.org. And you may want to in addition to reading while I was there, you might want to buy some of the books that are available along the side. Or even just send me some money, you know. Anyway, hooting yard is there for your edification and entertainment. And I will be back with or without pansy cradle jus next week in which he is with me, I'm going to ask him to tell us a bit more about our pavlovas pets one jack. Bye bye
