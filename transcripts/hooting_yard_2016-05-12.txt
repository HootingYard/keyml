Good evening. This is resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. This is hooting yard on the air. And I'm going to be reading to you for a while. My name is Frankie, or is it because this first piece I'm going to read begins. My name is sago and I am a glum inmate of Pang Hill orphanage. I was born in a faraway land. My power was a crusty man who fell into a pond and never surfaced. Later, they found a vent at the bottom of the pond, which led to a shoot, which in turn, led to a hideous abode of doom. My mama collected flies and fleas and similar we beast, often but not always winged ones. One day soon after patar plunged down the chute at the bottom of the pond. My mom took a little paper bag, with some of her flies in it to the parliament building of that faraway land. And when she showed reluctance to open the bag to the security guard, the magnetic barrier in the lobby, face shot her dead pass is the kind of land I come from. I spent a few months living off berries and rainwater and living in a cave on the coastline. Then, the captain of an illegal sorry, then the captain of an illegal fishing smack, scooped me out of the tide pool where I was happily paddling and brought me thousands of miles across the storm tossed oceans and delivered me to the gates of Pang Hill orphanage. That is my story in its broad outlines. I would tell you more, but it's time for my morning brain scan. No one at the orphanage has ever explained to me why each orphans brain is scanned three times a day. But I have made a plasticine copy of the key to the room behind the canteen in which look, the filing cabinets where the brain scan results are stored. And soon, I'm going to skulk in there as dead of night and examine all the results very, very closely. And then I'm going to shred them for I fear nobody and nothing. I am gone. stupendously brave and clever. And my name is sago.

I have a matter from a listener, Tim thurn, who asked me if I could address the topic of the blockman compartments controversy of 1934. So I'll go by Tim, I'll do my best. But I warn you that getting to grips with the botsman compartment is no easy matter. Have you ever looked into the fathomless Blackpool's of an owl's eyes? If you have, you will know that eerie sense of confronting an honorably alien cold unyielding energy. It was this sense of otherness that motivated blockman when he built the first of the notorious compartments. We still have some of his working notes, but they help us little couched as they are in a dense academic or pseudo academic language, which might have made no sense even to blockman phrases such as, by extension most advanced Paris dome or border plating is noted for an unusual hydro port stroke. gone Oh pour in the accessible interplay and the position of juvenile summit mounted proximal tagged men's and Sica flux the best of brains. We do know that whenever botsman constructed a compartment he made sure a fully functioning fan at oh four was primed and ready in the corner of his workshop.

As he learned to manipulate the compartments, botsman became more open about his intentions. He introduced a swiveling panel on the top of each compartment, allowing viewers the opportunity for a fleeting glimpse of activity within the panels were attached to a small motor fix to the side of the compartment. Power powered from a source which botsman always refused to divulge. Though it's likely to have been a simple dry cell battery. It might even have been a wet cell battery, if such a thing exists. Nothing Nothing of batteries and their workings. I'm reluctant to say any more about this for the time being. Arriving at the optimal size of the compartments was a hit and miss affair, which usually found botsman gritting his teeth. A study by Howland flapper determined that the smallest compartment could fit inside a standard pastry carton, while the largest one known to exist, blotted out the moon and the stars. This reminds us of blots man's insistence that his compartments were never exposed to daylight, leading to absurd accusations in the gutter press that there was vampiric intent behind the entire project. Fire and flood destroyed all the botsman compartments one by one, over a period of 17 years botsman was sanguine, he himself had the black eyes of an owl and have that resemble feathers make of that what you will, you would not be the first to posit a madcap theory.

It's often said that misfortune can strike a cow out of the blue. To give it one example, the field in which it is standing may become flooded after heavy rainfall, or if not flooded, exactly, then pitted with many, many puzzles. No cow likes to stand in water. So such a circumstance must be counted on this fortune. The cow in the puddle however, is only una jolly Vash Excuse me. Let me begin that paragraph again. The cow in the puddle however, is jolly Vash compared to the cow which in attentively wanders onto some railway tracks, and then comes to a halt. Continuing across the tracks would be the wiser option for as long as the cow remains where it is, it is an imperiled cow. But unlike owls, cows are not noted for wisdom. The imperiled cow on the railway tracks may suffer the misfortune of being killed by a runaway locomotive without a cow conscious driver at the helm. I'm not sure Helm is the correct word for the little cabinet in which a train driver, cow conscious or otherwise sit or stand. But let that path. What we can say with certainty is that emotionless cow in the path of a runaway train will suffer the greatest of misfortunes. That is a violent death. By comparison, the previous cow, the one standing in the puzzle is almost as happy a cow as the laughing one that mysteriously appears on the wrappers of a brand of processed trees, triangles in this country, and perhaps in other countries too. if my memory serves that laughing cow is red and white. If a real cow was red and white, it's too would probably suffer misfortune. For it coloration would make it an easy target for predators. larger, more savage beasts, ones with vision alert to bright primary colors. In this case, red would be far more Likely to attack the laughing cow, then a neighboring cow that was say beige or done or even dappled. Such being the case. One wonders why the red and white cow is laughing. The fourth in our series of unfortunate cows is the one that is stricken by disease. In the popular mind the most notable Cow Disease is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. I for one can never read the technical phrase without visualizing a cow with a brain that has turned to sponge. That may be because on this pronouncing the word spongiform. Either way, I think we can agree that this is the least fortunate cow we have encountered so far. Next week we'll be taking a stroll down a pathway that leads to for more cows for sale by misfortune. Until when your homework is as follows. answer the following questions to the best of your ability and with a certain dash. One if through some eldritch soul transfer conjured by a warlock, you swapped places with one of the four unfortunate cows mentioned previously. Which one would it be? And why? Would you follow the example of the red and white cow and laugh in the face of misfortune? Or would you take steps to avert it? If so, how? Three, what tips would you give to a cow standing in a puddle? For Imagine you are a train driver. Would you be cow conscious? If so, list six examples of your cow consciousness.

That piece first appeared on hooting yard. I first read that on loading yard on the air. I don't know back in in in January 2006. And Mark Williams, a listener or perhaps a reader he may have read. He may have read it on the hooting God website. Which I recommend you all hooting yd.org Mark Williams actually did his homework and sent it in. And so I'll be I can I can. I don't know if mark is still listening 10 years later, but if he is he may be amused to hear his homework read out on the radio after all this time. One note to mark. Your handwriting is lopsided in future please ensure that the Express turbo motorcycle Korea arrives at hemoglobin towers before midnight. I'm not sure what I was talking about there. Anyway, here is Mark's homework. Question one. A cow is not wise. That's on that premise. Cows will inadvertently engender unfortunate situations as is proved by the four classic unfortunate situations that you have written about. So ultimately, I would require the best possible quality of life that is the least amount of suffering. Therefore, I would not want to get myself into unfortunate situations. The inevitable Swift, painless death of a cow standing in some on some railway tracks is my choice. This is dependent on the scruples of the helmet man. Crikey, there is a possibility of an unfortunate painful death resulting from a partial maiming caused by the driver braking and that's not fully killing the cow due to the reduced speed. I am now confused too. I would not laugh. Instead I would bury my head in the ground. However, due to the Unfortunate nature of a cow. I would no doubt stick my head in a field full of capers spurge, otherwise known as stinking hellebore. The dunnville family used this foul smelling cloud to read moles from the English countryside fascists. Three, I would tip the cow like this. Don't laugh in the face of misfortune, little cow. Otherwise, you could end up with more than you bargained for. For on the assumption that an eldritch soul transfer had taken place, then it is likely that this soul would have the same intention as me in the answer to question one that I would mow the cow down with my train at the highest speed possible.

Dobson was hopeless at identifying bones which should be ignored by wild animals. But that did not stop him trying. Sometimes, if he tired of leaning on a fence watching pigs in a sky, he would go and get his big spade and big up bones. He had a few favorite locations, such as the perimeter fence of the zoo, and the aerodrome, and he always came home with a sackful. Look, he would shout, brandishing one of his finds at marigold, too. If I am not mistaken, this is the leg bone of a weasel which has been ignored by a pony. Or look, he might say, I'll wager. This is the tibia of an Arctic hair that has been ignored by a squirrel. He was invariably wrong. Dobson mounted his bones on rectangular pieces of hardboard, which he then hung on the walls of what pastor's his study. He added a carefully written label to each one on which he inscribed the date and location on which he exuded the animal he supposed it came from, and the animal whose teeth marks he purported to see as evidence of knowing. Often these striations were not teeth marks at all, but Dobson was adamant. One wet February Friday, Dobson and marigold ku received a visit from Glasgow pice Meyer, a man who bore an uncanny resemblance to the meteorite obsessed ex liberal democrat MP Lembit opik vasto PES Maya supplied cocoa to circuses, having heard erroneously that marigold crew was a past queen bee of the Flying Trapeze. He was hoping to sell cocoa to her for old times sake, quickly apprised of his mistake. pice Maya was about to leave when Dobson in an uncharacteristic fit of generosity invited him to stay for dinner. He stayed not only for dinner, but for the next four months, during which time he barely stopped talking. Is it sad of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge that he could talk for hours fluently entrancingly with barely a pause, but without his interlocutors, having the faintest idea what on earth he was going all about. Flash dough piss Meyer was a man of the same kidney. Adoption found him fascinating. on that first evening, as they sat around the table eating pap and slops, peice Meyer, having been shown Dobson's collection of labelled bones said, I find it interesting that your surname matters Gold is true. While in that other room, there are always bones which have been ignored. Are you sure that your name is not marigold nor and that the bones have been chewed, but of course not I jest. if my memory serves, the OED defines true as to crush brews and grinds to pulp by the continued action of the molar teeth, with help of the tongue, cheeks and saliva, and nor as to bite something persistently, so as to injure it or remove portions of it to wear away by a continued biting or nibbling. So whereas one might idli think of chewing annoying as similar activities, they are in fact radically different. Equally worthy of note is the fact that in this house of cu and the Nord, the dinner you have both so kindly provided requires neither truing nor knowing being a bland thin sludge, one can go down bowl off the bowl, without involving one's teeth one whit. It is the kind of dinner I approve of, for I like to rest my teeth as others rest their weary limbs, the better to preserve them. Speaking of which, if I were you Dobson, I would start collecting animals teeth as well as bones. So you could match up the nor with the Nord.

Dobson never followed this advice, but it did inspire the coder to one of his finest out of print pamphlet, which he began writing on the wet June day later that year when the cocoa man finally left the house. The circumstances of his departure were curious. marigold two had embarked upon a mural painting of eels, using one of the walls of the dining room, because he seemed to need no sleep. vasto peice Maya had barely moved from the dinner table throughout his stay comfortable in his chair and prattling away irrespective of an audience. It had occurred to both Dobson and marigold true that perhaps he existed in a separate time continuum, and that he thought they were still having the same meal as when he had arrived in February. The fact that he never removed the napkin, tucked under his shirt front supported this view. What I find puzzling, said marigolds to to Dobson on the morning of that June day, as they trudged along the old canal towpath is that when he sat down, the walls were bare. Now they're teeming with eels. Yet he appears not to notice. Perhaps he is a blind cocoa man, suggested Dobson. Don't be ridiculous. Dobson snorted marigold. As I approached the house on their return, they were astonished to find the Lembit opik look alike hurrying out of the front door. I could no longer remain in a house full of painted eels. He shouted, looking stricken, for I have long feared evil depictions of all kinds. If ever you invite me to dinner again, I will tell you why. He carried on talking, but as he scurried away, his words will last on the wild wind. within the hour, Dobson had written the first six pages of his pamphlet, true nor eel teeth, papen, slops for dinner, a memoir of vasto peice Maya, the only known copy which is rumored to be in the possession of the ex libris, Democrat MP for Montgomery share, he keeps it under lock and key, and will deny its existence if ever questioned.

Here's a quotation. stealing a little to one side and crouching against the dark hangings of the wall. I could see him in the faint light which dimly illuminated the hole, and then I discovered that my surmise was correct. No Rhonda was quietly at work. curious to learn more, and knowing that only mystery could have been inspiring him. I sank into a thick robe on the floor and watched him to my greatest punishment naranja was tearing off with his teeth, the bag, which served as his outer garment. And that's a quotation from the ape, the idiot and other people by WC Morrow. That is a great title, I think, the ape the idiot and other people. And here's another quotation, and it's also about eight. This is from our inner ape by Franz de Waal. apes are not just our kin, they are also capable of human kindness. A bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee at Twycross zoo, is famous for gently rescuing a stand Starling, protecting it and helping it fly away. Well, no hunting yard on the air show is complete without stunts, darlings I often find and that's nearly the end of this week's show. But I think I've got time to redo something else. I have I don't know. Let me see. I'm faffing about here because I don't really know what I'm doing. Okay, here's a quotation from probabilities by Martin Fogg OFF TOP His commands to the My brother's was substantially these. Take your Mattox and pick up that stone flooring. Then take your basket and fill it with the bones of hyenas and other creatures, which you will find that we may fancy the ridicule, were with ignorance might have greeted science. But lo, the triumph of philosophy, when its mandate soon assumed a bodily shape in the bushels of bones nor dies by wild beasts. And here are their a grinning skull that looked like a hyenas. And all of this stuff I'm reading to you is from is from the 10 year old hooting yard. And I seem to have been completely obsessed with Nord bones at the time, and apes. And one last quotation, and then we'll call it a day for today, and I'll be back next week. This is from Matt Shatner, and Arthur L. Zagat book, The Song of the cake. As he stood there musing, the door burst open, but a great clamor and shouting, and a mob of drunken soldiers poured through the gap. They were staggering under silken robes, golden goblet helmeted their heads, precious ornaments of dried dangled from their persons. The foremost of the writers beheld the ancient Ming priest, with joyous cries by pounced upon him, seized him with on gentle hands. Oh, outlived reptile of a curse of any age. Give us your hidden treasures, or we slit your wisdom throat. The priest struggled feebly in his captors grasp, crying feebly given that it took two people to write the song of the cake, I'm surprised that they didn't edit themselves, because that the priest struggled feebly in his captors grasp crying feebly. I mean, did they not realize that I just said feebly twice. I've now said it five times. And I don't know what I'm talking about this afternoon. I'm, I feel feeble. And I'm going to go away now. And I'll come back next week, and I'll review some more. And it may or may not be about trude up bones and apes and all sorts of rather bloodthirsty stuff. Maybe I'll write the song of the cake. Bye bye.
