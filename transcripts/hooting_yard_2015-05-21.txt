Frank Key  00:20
Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four seven. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Normally on the show, I like to read brand new pieces that have been written in the last week or so. But those of you who keep an eye on on hooting out online on the blog at hooting yd.org will know that it remained eerily silent for about two weeks now. One of the longest gaps there has been in what 12 years or so, of hooting yard online. I'm not sure why that is. I just haven't written anything for two weeks. So I haven't had anything to put on the blog. I'm sure I'll get back to tippy tapping my keyboard soon enough. Anyway, as I haven't got anything, I've got a couple of things I haven't read on the show. But it occurred to me that it might be a good idea to do a kind of greatest hits, or best golf or something like that. And in fact, what so on this show would act as a good Sam's Club, someone said, if you ever heard hooting out on the air? No, I haven't. Well, you should listen to it. I recommend the show from May 21 2015. where Mr. Kay read some of his favorite pieces. And that's this show. They're not necessarily my favorite pieces, but they're the pieces that I tend to read when I do rare, live appearances. in public, I'm doing one of those tomorrow actually at the Greenwich Book Festival in Greenwich, which is in London. And I'm going to be appearing alongside Stuart, home of the great Stewart home and Toby litt. And someone called Paul Yuan is introducing us. Excuse me, as far as I know, that's at seven o'clock in a tent on the lawn outside the Naval College, I think but you can always check it online. Just put Greenwich Book Festival into Google. And so among I might read some of the things that I'm on the show today, I will return the things that I like to read when I appear live. And we'll begin with an old favorite they hopefully they're all old favorites. An old favorite called a weekend with an owl God. If you've ever spent a weekend with an owl God, you will know that it can be a character building experience. I have vivid memories of the time chat to a cat Oh lottle the night owl god of the Aztecs made itself at home in my flat for three trying days. I live in a glitzy and gleaming block of futuristic design impossibly Stark with lots of exciting remote control hubs. But the fact is, it's small, even pokey, and it doesn't help that I have crammed into it. The contents of my miles laboratory and my past garden shed together with much of the furniture thrown out when the local vet refurbished his waiting room, and a jumble of junk from a hellhole. That Friday evening I was crumbled on a city eating lemon meringue pie and reading pebble heads best selling paperback brute beauty and valor and act Oh air pride plume here buckle. When the front door sensor vibrated. The Hub hummed and the plasma display flashed insistently. I had a visitor, though, no one was expected. thinking it might be a goon coming to serve me with an asbo I depress the knob on the entry pod, put down my pie plate, and tiptoed my way through some of Mars laboratory equipped To the door. peering through the slat I saw a hunched and somewhat shabby figure dressed like a bus conductor. If you can remember bus conductors. Hey, I thought it was a he was not holding anything that might be an asbo. So being an affable thought I opened the door.

Frank Key  05:23
Hey, or rather, it almost knocked me over, as it somehow soared past me and came to rest next to the city. Before either of us spoke it, plucked my plate off the floor and scoffed what was left of the lemon meringue pie. Then it said, Good evening. I am an Aztec God. My name is trochu who tackled wattle and I am an hour god of the night. You look like a bus conductor are applied and a shabby one at that. Dan, it screeched at me. It was the loudest and longest screech I have ever had the misfortune to hear my eyes. My ears did not stop ringing until Sunday lunchtime. by which time the hour God had completely taken over my life within the confines of my fab, but tiny flat, it swooped it pected things, it's shifted shape. It did some strange rewiring manipulations to my stereo system. It fluttered and preened. It fixed me for hours with a cold inhuman stare. It sprouted tufts and feathers. It would not let me read my pebble head paper back. It hooked up gobbets of semi digested pie, smashed all miles laboratory equipment to smithereens. Then ate the smithereens shifted shape again. It summon some of it as tech God pals and held a rowdy Saturday night party. It kept me awake by looming menacingly, just out of sight. It filled the bath with wounded mice and stoats and weasels. It made me sit through a four hour documentary about Spandau Ballet. Its metabolism speeded up to the point where everything in the flat was shaking. It found that my friends and told them that I'd moved to dawlish, it somehow managed to drag a live Swan into the bathroom and savaged it with its talents. It screeched and screeched drowning out the shipping forecast. It burned his bright incandescent fury into my soul. And on Monday morning, it shape shifted again, just as it was pulverizing my bread bin and turn back into what looked like a shabby bus conductor. I'm leaving you now, it said, and it sounded almost regretful. I watched it leave and slumped on what was left of this tea. I took a nap, and then I went to see the priest to explain to him that I was renouncing the Roman Catholic faith forever. He tried to lure me into the confessional box, but I threatened to tear his beating heart out of his chest and make an offering of it to that mighty orb. The sun back shut him up. I sashayed off through the glittering streets, past Pang Hill orphanage, and across sawdust bridge towards glory.

Frank Key  13:33
I banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of my worries. Excuse me. Hold on a second.

Frank Key  13:55
Right, just taking on fluids. I'll start again. I banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of my troubles. The font was hewn from adamantine rock, on the water contained, though of necessity holy water was icy. When the priest swapped it onto my bashed head. I screamed at such a pitch that a stained glass window depicting the martyrdom of Saint bibley babe, spikes, tongs fire was shattered, a falling shard, sliced the priest juggler, and he collapsed, but not before dropping me into the font. Why am I splashed about boiling and freezing miniscule organisms with which the water was riddled swam into my ears and borrowed tiny tunnels into my brain, wherein they laid their eggs. If the organisms were miniscule, imagine Have microscopically tweet where the eggs before death claim me. I was plucked from the font by the Sexton, whose beard was so vast and hairy. I was almost suffocated as he clutched me to him gurgling, I was passed to my mother, a woman of great dustiness, who endangered my life many a time in the following month, usually by taking me to unsuitable picnics, unsuitable in that they took place in snowstorms or during beaumier weather on steep hillsides down which I would roll gathering pace as I approached the bottom, a railway line or a major arterial thoroughfare along which huge container lorries thundered. Fortunately, by perplexingly, the Sexton was always on hand to rescue me in the nick of time. Miraculously, I survived into toddlerhood. Around this time, my mother began to encourage me to play on the roof of our hotel during electrical storms. I was grateful for the rubber boots, and leadline swaddling jacket, the Sexton gave me more than once I toppled from the roof into the moat, and I soon learned to swim skillfully, to dodge both the sharp fangs scavenger fish and the unexploded mines they're in regular swing while wearing Raymond have led does wonders for to build up one's muscular strength. And sure enough, by my sixth birthday, my mother was exhibiting me at circuses and freak shows. I was known as Little Daigo bird, the strongest boy in the universe. Sometimes I came close to being flattened by the steam rollers I pulled across the lawns and village greens until the Sexton gave me a handy tip to avoid even the gentlest of downhill inclines. Being a very implausibly rare blood group, I had to be extra careful in the vicinity of sharp knives, axes and slices. My caution served me well when, on my 10th birthday, my mother had me apprenticed to a well known butcher. He was a florid, chubby, deranged and blood drenched man, who took both pride and pleasure in his inhumane slaughtering methods. I was inconsolable for days after he slew the Sexton and chopped him to bits and made him into illegal pie fillings are resolved to run away to see though we lived far, far from any coast. One crisp autumn this dawn, I gathered my few pitiable belongings and tied them in a bundle, untied the bundle to the end of a stick, and with the stick prop jauntily over my shoulder, I set out to make my way in the world. Before I got as far as the garden gate, however, the microscopic eggs in my brain all hatched once and set forth monsters, though I had passed through much travail, in my short life, things were about to get much, much worse.

Frank Key  19:27
Listen tiny ones. If you're good, I'll take you on an outing. I'll take you to the old balsa wood factory on the edge of the Big Blue Lake. Every Thursday afternoon, at two o'clock, there is a tour of the factory, especially for tiny tots. The Hooters sound and everyone lines up at a kiosk in the carpark and Mr. verdigris appears in his towering hat with bells on his sleeves and ribbons and bunting and hamsters nestling in his pocket and he takes the lucky people The ones with tickets on a tour of the factory. I was sent some tickets in the post yesterday as a special treat. I know that Tim the radio meteorologist says that first day will be a day of driving rain and howling gales and I know that it will be the fourth day of our fast and we will be finished. But I'm determined that we go. The alternative is that we spend yet another afternoon trying to tether the wild goats. And I'm not sure I can take much more of that. So the balsa wood factory it will be. First, there was the grass verge of the car park and then alone. Some derelict outbuildings including a shed were in rotted the remains of the hanged janitor and then the factory itself. Its cavernous interior lit by thousands of gas jets, and eerily silent save for the occasional buzzing of a soul or the distant insistent pounding of a pulper from the annex over beyond the railway tracks, a sound born in on the wind. After that, up the metal Stairway to the offices always deserted on Thursday afternoons, even tiny little shoes, making the floorboards creak, and shelves upon shelves stacked with Higgledy Piggledy piles of files and papers and docket and Mr. verdigris took for hamsters from his pocket and placed them on a bed of straw next to an important looking desk. It surfaced, polished to the subject gleam has left the children dumbfounded and resting on it, nothing but a fat

fountain pen, and the biggest bottle of ink you could imagine, and the pen had never been used, and the bottle never opened for the lids of both wood jammed by dint of mischievous sprites that scampered in the rafters overhead. And it was up to the rafters now, up to the attic, past boxes and crates filled with rusty unexplicable machines, redundant cash registers, and forgotten magnetic recording devices through a narrow corridor littered with broken brooms and hosts to a mysterious gurgling noise until we reached the chamber. The end on our tour guide in his towering hat, kicked open the door so violently and we enter the room lit in a blue blue glow like heaven, and they're in the corner sprawled on a divan whistle Pinocchio dexterously plucking flies out of the blue air with his tiny fingers and biting the tiny head of each tiny fly with his tiny wooden teeth.

Frank Key  23:38
Well, if I read it quickly, I think there's time for just one more. Now there dwelt in gaffa moptop, whose name was ringgo and one day the Lord appeared to Ringo and he was sort of frightened. Ringo tagged the friend of his moptop so it might cover his eyes, that he could hide the Lord from his sight. Being not I feared moptop boom the Lord for the door walk for the Lord always speak in a boom when he appeared in gas. And ringgo, who carried a stick in each hand with which he thumped animal hides had dropped his sticks when tugging at his hair. Pick up by sticks commanded the Lord and Ringo did so. What does that want with me Lord? wailed ringgo he was an hairy mop top with many rings on his fingers, and an innate sense of rhythm. Thou shalt Heidi hence turpis Gar, booms the Lord, and thou shalt climb to the top of the mountain, and thou shalt thump by sticks there upon the hides of bison and salamander stretched upon a frame on thump them to upon disks of metal and make a den. And the Lord made mysterious maneuvers with his hands and bless gringo the mop top and then he He vanished in a cloud of vipers sness an all was still and Ringo was alone in death. And Ringo betook himself with great haste to the main railway Terminus in gas, where he might catch a train to take him all the way to pisgah. Now at the railway Terminus, there was a satrap of exceeding girth, and Ringo spake unto him saying, I am sent to pisgah by the Lord, but I know not how I might Journey's End from here. And the satrap lettering go to a tank engine and commanded him in a voice of great pump to step aboard. The engine was blue, the blue of heaven. And with cogs and wheezes the tank engine with the mop top aboard set off along the branch line to Piz Gar. But lo, unbeknownst to ringgo, the satrap of exceeding girth had so arranged things that the engine was shunted into sidings halfway between got gas and his car, and there it sat and would not move. And thus did ringgo. The mop top find himself marooned, and far from his car, and from the mountaintop, and his two sticks dangled from his boring fingers with not to thump, and he wept.

Frank Key  27:07
Anyway, cuz sometimes he don't want to listen to someone babbling on for hours and hours. If you do want to listen to me babbling on for hours and hours, may I recommend the resonance, FM podcast archive. And if you go to the podcast, kind of the front page of the resonance website, and I think there's a bit that says podcast and he got other podcasts, and there's all the categories. If you got a hosting out, you'll find more than as far as our record more than 200 shows, possibly something like 250 shows, which if you think of the number of hours that is, it's quite terrifying. Anyway, you could just sit and listen to that, from, you know, a long, long time and by the time you got to the end, you'd have forgotten what you heard at the beginning. So you could listen to it all again, for the rest of your natural life. If you on the other hand, if you live in London and want to come and see me talking, reading some of the stuff that I've just been reading. Come to Greenwich find the tent with me and Stuart instru at home and Toby litt can pull you in in it at seven o'clock. And yeah, that's that's what you can do, and I'll be there. So I hope you've enjoyed the show. I'll be back next week. And that is all for this week. I don't want a really badly done ending Nevermind. Bye bye.
