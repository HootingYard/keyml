Afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frankie and this is hooting yard on the air. Before going on just another thank you to the people who contributed words last week for the sponsored word story, which raised an amount of money, which I don't know. But anyway, whatever it was, it will be useful towards that 60,000 pounds. And it's not too late to get your checkbook out or click a button on your mouse and give money to resonance. I'd like to talk to you about czars really old Russia had only one bizarre at a time. But now of course we have many of them, each with their own speciality like patron saints, traffic czars drugs czars respect czars. Every week some bug eyed government wonk creates yet another bizarre them such power. Apparently Blodgett he used to be Azhar for a few weeks. It was a gorgeous summer afternoon, and he was putting the finishing touches to his sleek, gas powered Uber pod, when one of those bug eyed government wonks came prancing up the path out of nowhere. Blodgett put down his rag on a pile of other rags, dipped his hairy hands into a tub of swore fieger and watch them on one of the other rags from the pile, or perhaps on the one he had just dropped. He adjusted his lawn yet with exquisite daintiness and look the one over as if he were examining a beetle. Blodgett had history with wanks, as they say, and he was prepared for anything. You are Blodgett asked the wanke in a wonky monotone. Blodgett was tempted to call his lip, but he was still wearing a protective cotton dimity thing over his nose and mouth, so instead he nodded his assent. We need to appoint a cow buyer czar announced the wanke without preamble and your name has been put forward. There is a modest step end and an armband. Congratulations. If the wanke said anything else, his words were wasted, for he was drowned out by the sudden appearance of swooping corncrakes. Blodgett ushered him into his heart and put the kettle on. What does the job involve? he asked his booming voice only slightly muffled by the dimity thing. Oh, you know, just go and hang around cow buyers being sort of zary replied the wanke. What Blodgett was not told was that he was expected to send in daily reports, including the Latin names of the cows in each buyer he fell upon, looming in his fears, blood jetty and the way in the shadows, and added difficulty was that all accounts he visited seemed twinkle like stars in the heavens. His first report was sent back to him, his lovely handwriting, virtually obliterated by comments and corrections, scribbled with an impossibly thick black magic marker pen. Blodgett wept that night, huge convulsive sobs racking his frame as he crouched next to his Uber pod. His second and third reports fared no better, so he stopped sending them and nothing happened. Each morning as dawn broke, he would dawn his cow buyer's armband and stride out towards yet another cow buyer of twinkling cows and loom zaarly for hours upon end, before returning home to his soup and his fireside. No word came from the wank for the one word his sweetheart and fled to a city of curious puddles and gigantic towers of granite, and he never again thought much about cows, twinkling or otherwise. And after a few weeks, Norden Blodgett, he put his cow bias armband on his pile of rags, and soon it was smeared with swore fieger just another Blodgett rag PostScript, six months later, Blodgett hat was crushed by a stampede of twinkling cows, he was out at the time.

This next piece is about kettles and on the news On the exciting new hooting yard web page which is w w w dot hooting yard.org It's a proper blog thing now and so people can leave comments. And this piece has, for some reason, attracted more comment than any other piece on the page. In fact, one of the commenters said that the kettle I'm about to describe to you was meretricious, which I'm not sure I agree with. Anyway. This is called Satan's spa. And it's entirely true. pansy cradle drew bought a new kettle reasonably tempting though it is to use this as an excuse to regale you with my all encompassing kettle theories, and believe me, you will be impressed. I'd like instead to say a few words about the particular make of cattle Miss cradle to purchased. There is an egg shaped window in the side of the kettle which enables the pleased as punch cattle owner to see at a glance the water level of the water that has been pulled out of a tap or spigot into the kettle. It may be argued that I should have rewritten that sentence so that it's less ungainly and doesn't mention the kettle three times. But I want to be absolutely clear. And I wrote this piece in a rush. When I was writing it there was a pot of tea to be brewed, and I couldn't type and make tea at the same time. You try it and see how difficult it is. When the power is on but the kettle is switched off. That is when it's plugged into the wall socket and the wall socket is switched on, but the kettle remains in its default. at rest, idle state and internal light is activated and through the egg shaped window the excited Catalonia sees a blue glow. This has the effect of making the water look not unlike a tropical sea, or at least a tiny portion of such as sea on a blazing hot summer day. No small benefit when one lives in a land of ice chaos. Depress the switch underneath the kettles handle however, and the blue glow is instantly transformed into a glow that is bright red. That kettle is now on and begins to boil the water which was poured into it from the tap or spigot gradually begins to bubble. as it approaches boiling point. The combination of seething bubbling water and a blood red glow makes it look like a scene from hell. Satan's spa I would have written further about kitchen based excitements but at the time I finished writing that it was time for a pot of tea.

Here's a tiny Enid story for all the tiny Enid fans out there. I know there are many many of you. One morning, tiny Enid are woke from uneasy dreams with a sense of tremendous urgency related to potatoes. She was based in Winnipeg at the time and had taken a room and a motel of undoubted seediness. I could not pinpoint the reasons for my sense of breathless urgency on that grim March morning. She wrote many years later in her memoirs, all I knew was that potatoes had something to do with it. The heroic young adventurous eschewed the motel breakfast, a winner peg style egg and dough platter, sneaking out of a side entrance to avoid the man with the twisted lip, the front desk. The city was still new to her and she had yet to locate any of the potato related premises. She felt such a tremendous urgency to visit. She limped across the plaza to her rented a booster car and threw off its tarpaulin in one elegant sweep. Tiny Enid had been practicing her elegant, sweeping arm movements for some weeks, and the superb elegance with which she swept the tarpaulin off the car won her round of applause from a nearby line of patient pastry persons Queuing outside a pastry shop. Before revving up the engine of her booster car, tiny Enid tramped over to the queue. She wanted to find out if she could sense an aura of potato urgency here, so close to her motel. It was possible after all, that among the pastries sold by the pastry shop, could be pastries with a potato filling Was that urgency that cracked her awake a premonition that a Winnipeg based criminal mad person had poisoned the potato pastries? If so, it would make sense for her to be bang on the scene rather than having to speed around the city. Last unnerved in her rented a booster car and not knowing quite what she was seeking, nor why. So many of the adventures of the tiny adventurous had begun from these moments of curious intuition. But it was still early in the day, and the pastry shop proprietor had not yet hoisted the shutters, hence the cue. Tiny Enid was hopeless at small talk, and she was at a loss how to engage with the still clapping cue, which was so impressed with the elegance of her sweeping arm movements. She pulled her sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat down low and pretended an interest in pebbles piled close to the pastry shop shutters. If instincts were correct, she must be first into the shop when the shutters went up before a poor innocent Winnipeg guide was felled by a poisoned potato pastry pie. Tiny Enid was a girl of impeccable manners. And she flushed with shame in anticipation of having to push aside the unkempt hobble the boy who was first in the queue, and who looked as if he had not eaten for a month. Luckily is the pastry shop proprietor appeared with a hook on the end of a wooden pole, which with which by some shenanigans he hoisted the shutters there was a distraction over by the statue of prominent Winnipeg ight Elias Conklin, who had been the city's mayor in 1881, a swarm of killer bees appeared out of the blue and set upon a defenseless old woman wearing her widow's weeds. The masked buzzing of the bees was nauseatingly loud, and the reaction of the pastry shop q was instantaneous. Even the starving hobble the hoist that got his grumbling belly as the line broke up, sprinting over to the Conklin statue, flailing impromptu be scarifiers our tiny heroine took the opportunity to sneak into the pastry shop, thumping the proprietor in the guts with her girly bludgeon. She incapacitated him with a few clicks to the head, swiftly located behind the counter every single piping hot pastry with a potato ingredient and stuffed a lot of them into a canvas sack. She dragged the sack over her rented booster car, trapped it into the boot and sped away. Just in time for the killer bees had been confounded the widow woman was safe and the patient pastry people were heading back to the pastry shop with coinage clutched in their fists.

an hour or so later, having dumped the canvas sack of potato pastries into the river at the forks where the Red River meets the assiniboine and then driven around until she found verdant Parkland. Tiny Enid slumped onto a tuffet dusted off her sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat and lit one of her high tar Paraguayan cigarettes. Soon she knew she would have to hunt down the criminal mad person and bashed them about. But for now, the world could take a pause and she could sit on her tablet and smoke and watch the Coots and more hens for whom a winner peg pond was home.

Before moving on to the next story, I just want to add a little memory of last Saturday, Saturday was a very special diet hooting yard. It was Yoko Ono 74th birthday, just as the people of Tana in Vanuatu in the southwest Pacific worship the Duke of Edinburgh as a god. We here at hooting yard recognize the divinity of Yoko. Our devotion took a bit of a battering a few years ago when Mrs. gubbins dallied with Yoko kinetics. But of course of brain sluicing with Baxter's terrible fluid and a visit from Yoko's lawyer set her back on the true path. And I'm pleased to tell you that I spent that special day on Saturday in a field near blister lane bypass sitting in a bag with wall wrapped around my legs screaming. If you want to know more about Yoko netex go to hooting yard And follow the link. The link is in fact to a stiff letter from Yoko, saying she has nothing to do with Yoko netex. Believe that his one in a series of hiking pickles. Dobson lived in the era before mobile phones, of course. So when he found himself in peril in an isolated spot, he had to harness every last scrap of ingenuity to summon help you or I would simply make a call on our mobile. Well, you would, but I wouldn't, because I don't own a mobile phone and I never showered for they are an abomination unto me. But this was not an option for Dobson. So what did he do? Let's take a closer look at the circumstances. It was a Tuesday in February, football fans were grieving the loss of the Busby Babes in the Munich air disaster. Pope Pius The 12th had declared that St. Claire was to be the patron saint of television, and little blind David Blunkett was just 11 years old. Meanwhile, Dobson got lost on an ill advised hiking expedition and found himself exhausted in a spinny menaced by feral goats. The out of print pamphleteer had also managed to get himself hopelessly entangled in a thicket of thorny brambly, creeping greenery, rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles. That's the kind of spinny it was at least 20 miles from the nearest village and with no paths nor country lanes leading anywhere close to it. There was it is true a big pile and a couple of dozen yards away, but it was a lone pylon. I'm connected to any kind of electrical grid or other wiring system, a pylon the purpose of which was unknown, and it was a pylon of rust suggestive of abandonment and disuse. This was not the first time Dobson had been in a hiking pickle, and it would not be the last. Indeed, late in life he had enough material to furnish a pamphlet entitled an anthology of disastrous hiking mishaps, cobbled together from a lifetime of ill starred rustic pursuits out of print. What was significant about this particular hiking pickle was the manner in which Dobson succeeded in extricating himself from it. This was the period during which he had joined an experimental knitting circle. And as luck would have it, he had in his Nadi bag that day, his latest project, it was an interpretation in wall of the wreck of the Deutschland by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Dobson realized that when fully unraveled, the yarn would stretch for miles. He sat down in the brambles lit his pipe, took the scrunched up woolen masterpiece out of his knotty bag and unraveled, unraveled unraveled. Two hours later, he was still unraveling. The sun was setting by the time he was done, but Dobson had no fear of the night, for he was sanguine. frequently asked question, why didn't the pamphleteer use his portable metal Tapping Machine to call for help? Answer, he was unable to use his portable metal Tapping Machine because there was no ground level pneumatic hub within reach. The wall fully unraveled Dobson tapped out his pipe on a stone and back into one of the firo toggenburg.

The goats were still gathered in a gang on the edge of the spinny and it's a mystery why they had not attacked the Bramble crap pamphleteer. In the anthology. Dobson suggested that a combination of accurate pipe smoke unraveled wall and his sanguine nature had deterred the goats. But it seems that for once he was being modest. Almost certainly, the decisive factor was Dobson's eerie ability to mesmerize goats, especially toggenburg. It is a skill which has not been much remarked upon, possibly because Dobson himself made light of it, and Curiously, never devoted a pamphlet to it. But he had been practicing goat mesmerize ation since he was a baby in arms, and now his expertise paid off, beckoning, or toggenburg. As I said, Dobson tied one end of the length of wall around one of its satanic horns, then whispered goat language into its ear. We do not know what he said, but presumably it was something like scamper away goat in a straight line and do not stop until you reach a village. It was not a village that the goats scampered to. However, three hours after being entranced it came to a wire fence, chewed its way through, and in so doing set off a hideous caterwauling alarm system. The night was filled with noise, and the toggenburg was caught in the white glare of a CLI glite. Within seconds, it was surrounded by a clumping troupe of visored commandos armed with Simon and Garfunkel rifles, inadvertently the mesmerised Capricorn had stumbled into a top secret military intelligence compound. A commando with a captain's badge bundle the goat onto a bauxite cradle change to a winch, while a second Commando. This one with a cadets badge untied the wool from its home. miles away. Dobson was smoking his pipe and lackadaisically paying out the wall hand over hand. Suddenly he felt it jerk and held on tight. And then he was yanked free of the thorny brambly, creeping greenery rife with puffy spiders and venomous beetles, and dragged across a wasteland of fields and gravel pits and swamps and countryside filth until he fetched up at the feet of the commandos who reeled him in just as midnight struck. That is how Dobson got out of a hiking pickle, only to find himself in a very alarming dilemma indeed, slap bang in the middle of a military intelligence compound that was top secret for very good reasons. reasons which, even at a distance of 50 years, I am far too terrified to divulge. He was placed in a holding cell with the feral goat and interrogated at length. The Wall was returned to him and he asked for and was given a pair of knitting needles. Between interrogations, he was able to reenact the wreck of the Deutschland. Although much of his woolen reimagining of the lines about the tool, none was Nord into scritti by the toggenburg. By the time the commandos released the pamphleteer, having scrambled his brain pan so thoroughly that he remembered nothing after the spinny Richard Milhouse Nixon had published his book six crises, Pluto and Neptune were in alignment for the first time in 403 years, and little blind David Blunkett was no longer so little. Dobson returned home even more sanguine than before the hiking pickle. As for the feral goat, it stayed with the commandos. They adopted it was a pet, and called it Flopsy.

If you hear any news from hemoglobin towers that birds are dropping dead from the sky and cow stand in the fields, it can mean only one thing. Alas, Mrs. gubbins has a new musical fad. The octogenarian Crone has taken her dusty hi fi system down from the shelf, open the windows and is blasting out the latest acquisitions from her record collection day and night over and over again. Last time this happened her and diluted enthusiasm for the fall meant that the peasants they're about to have to put up with the complete works of Marquis Smith cranked out at his splitting volume for weeks on end. lag. gubbins only grew tired of the self styled northern white crap that talks back after it was pointed out to her that Marquis Smith is slowly but surely turning into Anthony Burgess. Mancunian drunk on words and frighteningly prolific Of course, but the most compelling evidence is the physical resemblance. Lack gabions had always harbored a deep irrational hatred of Anthony Burgess, so she burned all her four records on a pyre and silence reigned. But now she's discovered the work of Swiss Maestro Blinky ghido laid her hands on every single record he ever made, and is in the throes of madness. Hence the dead birds Understand cows, Blinky ghido will be known to some of you as the man who created prog walk, and unholy alliance of progressive rock and Doo Wop which some enlightened lands have made illegal. You may have sat through the full 20 minute horror that is, Why Do Fools Fall in love in the Magic Kingdom of elves? Or even worse, these little eldritch unicorns of mine? Someone swears they saw Mrs. gubbins smuggling a Mellotron into her room the other day, which doesn't bear thinking about. Perhaps the only way to bring an end to this nightmare is to Dr. A photograph of the Swiss prog rock pioneer to make him look like JB Priestley, another writer who elicits for Mrs. gubbins a strangulated cry of loathing.

Last a modicum of sense from the pubescent noodle head to run the television schedules. I wonder if their ranks has been infiltrated by a dog's nest. Apparently, there's a forthcoming series on TV called strictly pamphleteering, in which contestants will write pamphlets and declaim them on live television. week by week as a panel of judges and the public will vote out the most hopeless would be pamphleteer. Until at the end of the series, The winner is crowned strictly pamphleteering pamphleteer of the year. No details have yet emerged of who will be on the judging panel, though names such as Dale Winton Yoko Ono, vs Naipaul and Leo Sayer have been touted. The panel will also decide on each week's pamphlet topic, with subjects ranging from all sprays to goat husbandry to the astronomical innovations of Tyco Bri, we can be sure that the eventual winner will have shown a splendid ability to decline Mighty pamphleteering pros about pretty much anything under the sun. Could this show bring us a 21st century Dobson? I live in hope.

Frank Key  28:16
And that brings us almost to the end of this week's hooting out on the air. I hope you've enjoyed it. And I mentioned well apart from mentoring for mentoring Yoko Ono far too many times and mentioned Jared Manley Hopkins and regular listeners will know that I often like to refer to the time when in his journals when Gerard Manley Hopkins describes his experience of mesmerizing a duck. And I was accused of only ever mentioning this and never mentioning anything else about Hopkins. So here's just another line from his journals written one day, he wrote, tunks is a good name. Gerard Manley tunks Pook tunks. And, on that note, I think I'll say bye bye for this week. Thank you very much for listening and have a nice week. Bye bye.
