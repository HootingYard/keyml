Good evening and a little light after all a kerfuffle well well worthwhile kerfuffle. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. I'm afraid I wasn't with you last week. And I'd like to say that I was abseiling down a slope in an important mountain range, or perhaps sailing the ocean wave aboard the private yachts of an oligarch. But neither of those things is true. And the truth is much more mundane. And in fact, so boring. I'm not even going to tell you what it was. And listeners will know that I have a weekly column called keys cupboard in a blog called the dabbler for connoisseurs of everything. And occasionally, on the show, I've given you a sneak preview of tomorrow's content of keys cupboard in the dabra. And that's what I'm going to do now. This week or tomorrow, it's going to be Quiz time. And I'm going to present you with nine passages of sober and sensible pros from some of the most sober and sensible works of the middling years of the last century. When I've read the nine passages, I will then present you with the nine pieces for the nine sources from which they come. And your task is using skill judgment, and Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies to match the passages to the sources listed. Long time longtime listeners will probably recognize one or two of these, because they're among my favorites, and I've probably read them innumerable times. here then is sensible Quiz time from tomorrow's edition of the dabbler and the first of the nine passages is as follows. Slowly the moon came out and splashed it evil coldness over the desert. And slowly, Halloran twisted his body around and stared with burning widened eyes at them. They were walking towards him with maddening deliberation, the most evil, the most unholy looking hideously repulsive group he had ever seen. The two might have been Cowboys, except for their faces. They were dressed in regular range gear, ropes, belted guns, loudly check shirts and handkerchiefs, stick boots, faded blue jeans, they're heavy, Batwing chaps flapping in the night like wings of Grizzly birds of evil. But the faces under the tall sombreros. They were the faces of ghoulish beast with snapping black eyes, huge canine nostrils, coarsely matted hair. Halloran stared and his tongue was hot and thick when he tried to move it. The word werewolves seem to tumble over and over in his numbed mind. passage number two a thought that dream came a sudden frightful hearts thrilling roar of destruction, a hideous crash followed by a terrible rending, breaking smashing concatenation of noises succeeded by frightful detonations. The ship was reduced in a few moments to a disjointed, disorganized, sinking massive shapeless, formless, splintered steel. passage number three. methodically, he got ready. He rigged up electrical operators, which would add mixtures of conglomerate matter to the rocket blast of the comet. He did the same with his blast guns, then, tightlipped hard died dressed once more in the spacesuit blast guns ready he returned to the controls. The comet shook and shivered with the recurrent rocket blast as he flashed through space towards the vast glowing globe of the aliens. blackness plucked at his senses. He could tell by the sudden clinking as loose pieces of metal flew to the walls and clung there that an alien energy right had brought him to a halt. He had cracked through into the vessel of the energy things, and now they were holding him they're a prisoner. passage number four.

She had no way of knowing how long she sat there before the tapping on her window brought her to her feet with a start. Stock fear squeezed the breath from her body and made her incapable of motion. Suddenly, a face appeared at the window. A strange face yet hauntingly familiar. In a flash, she recognized it to be that of Phyllis the trapeze artist, but in some way it was different. haltingly, she made her way to the window, and threw back the cash into the room bounded the half nude figure of a man. And number five, I think I'm losing count. I think this is number five. This one, longtime listeners by recall. It was marrow dark, the fashionable radio astrologer whose name was on every woman's tongue. Slade had seen him often passing through the village in his big foreign made car with his jaded and divorced companions on whose neurotic faces slades I had read the imprint of sickening abnormalities did the orders which were said to go on in Mero darks House have any bearing on these best deal atrocities slayed plotted back to his car. His brain was our whirling chaos. Number six. Early that evening, the real our Fang had been waylaid by a style what rough looking character who had thrust a peculiarly shaped gun into the Chinese his face, a jet of powerful and nice the tising vapor and shock from that gum. Our Fang had dipped into unconsciousness and had been whisked away in a powerful motorcar. For the store what man was none other than secret agent acts concealed behind another of his masterly disguises. No identity was too difficult for him to assume. His special plastic volatile compound could be molded to resemble the contours of any face. His own formulated pigments, clever toupees face plates and other elements of makeup had enabled him to create for himself the exact replica of the face of our Fang. Seven I did what I could with a hunting knife and forceps without dyes or microscope, swallowing my nausea. It was a nauseating thing, memorizing what I found. But as the sun rose higher, the thing liquefied melted, until by nine o'clock there was nothing but a glutinous great puzzle with two green eyes swimming in it. And these eyes, I can see them now burst with a thick pop, making a detestable sticky ripple in that puddle of corruption. Number eight, Carlin's deep shadow dies with flaming pools of Mad menace. I could shoot you both down where you stand he rasped but that would be a foolish waste of valuable material. I shall turn the two of you over to the dweller in the pool. Dorothy lane cried aloud in Tara Collins thin lips rise dinner snarling smile. Who or what is the dweller in the pool? demanded Kent. And what devil's work is Carlin doing here anyway? The dweller in the pool? Dorothy answered her low voice trembling is my brother roll. Small wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine to take to the very air with a shuttering miasma of crepitus and dread. And finally, number nine, on the second day, Sahib, as I sought in the darkest part of the forest among great trees of padouk and Sal many cubits Hi, it happened that I heard a great rending of wood and lifting my eyes I beheld the father of all the NATS Tara great tree asunder. Spring at me from the bowels they're all of the fate was the face of the bow only more terrible, but the arms were of the thickness of a man's leg and hairy as those of a spider.

So that's passages numbered one to nine, and I've appended letters of the alphabet to the nine sources. Your task is to match the numbers and the letters. A, Eric Linux, the layer of the Damned, B, Cyrus Townsend Brady, and thus he came. See Maya crawl felled the thing from Antara is d huge a gala her death mate for the last last he john H.

mention of the dabbler reminds me that of course you leave birth listeners really should always know that everything I read here is available to read on the hooting yard website, which the to the website and the radio show. I kind of like conjoined twins really. But when you go to visit the website and after you've made your donations, which are always helpful to enhance your hooting art experience, and to provide you with unalloyed Glee, or at the very least a short break from your habitual sobbing into a filthy napkin. It's recommended that you download hooting yard Service Pack six. So this pack six contains a bundle of exciting features which integrate hooting yard with popular Weber drivel such as Witter face ditch Dobson pamphlet, piffle, Skippy Zippy and Michel Foucault's transgressive insurrection of subjugated knowledges light. As an added bonus, this update will cause your computer to do a lot of buzzing and worrying for no apparent reason. And it may even hit an emit jets of steam. If you download it, you'll find a button and you press the button when you're in the zone. Note that the button will remain inactive until you enter the zone, which you can do by casting aside that filthy napkin and rereading every single word posted in hooting yard since December 2003. Learning selected passages by heart and then declaiming them in a booming voice from a top on at all, or a grassy knoll stunning passers by with your erudition. And people will come to hooting yard for a variety of reasons. Of course, some of them go there because they intend to. But other people seem to just sort of turn up because they've put something into Google and the most popular search terms that bring unwitting interweb share hikers to the gates of hooting yard. The three most popular search terms over a number of years now are BS. Dougie withers and lobs The diagram and I'm not making that up, but that's what the stats tell us. One day however, two people, two separate people arrived at hooting yard after typing in more hen Appreciation Society. Well, we know all about more hands that hooting God and we appreciate them too. So I trust the visiting hikers went away suitably happy. Meanwhile, pursuing my own researches, I discovered the existence of the more hand Appreciation Society on Facebook. I was charmed to say the least by a single item of news, which is I saw a more hand this morning. I cannot say the same for myself. Alas, although I did spot a few squirrels, one of which was carrying and it's squirrel drawers for shredded remains of a Mars bar wrapper. I'm fairly sure that Dobson was at one time a member of his local more hand Appreciation Society. The out of print pamphleteer joined it for reasons we can only guess at that as we know the space in the human brain devoted to own a theological matters was in Dobson's case either utterly vacant, or so clogged up, but the sign apses misfired. He was forced to resign his membership when it became clear that he could not tell the difference between a more hand and a Heron and embroiled the society and legal entanglements in the bird court. His pamphlet, well, they both have beaks and feathers for Christ's sake, out of print, recounts the whole sorry saga, though it's quite an exasperating read for those of us who are more engaged with the avian world, the Dobson walls.

I don't know what happened to the music there. But you know, these things happen. It's for live resonance on the live hooting yard experience. Upon Pang hill there is a plaque battered and burnished and copper and commemorative, affixed to a stone marking the spot once occupied by the Pang Hill plop pit, the pit into which generations of tinies from Pang Hill orphanage, plopped things discarded and abandoned. incessant rainfall in those parts meant that there was forever a puddle at the bottom of the pit. And the presence of the puddle meant that when a thing discarded or abandoned was tossed into it, the thing made a plop as tossed and falling, it landed in the puddle. Often times the depth of the puzzle was such that the plopping thing was wholly submerged under the rainwater. Sometimes when rainfall was light was but a drizzle, much of the puddle of water would leach into the muck, and the puddle became shallow. And then the thing discarded or lost would remain visible to those who looked and tell us storm came and the puddle level rose, and the waters covered the tossed away abandoned a once a week on Thursday mornings, the Pang Hill plop pit became a bubbling, bubbling, fizzing fuming, frothing gaseous pit. The orphanage janitor emptied into it numerous pile falls of nine possibly corrosive acid, which dissolved all the items tossed and plopped into the puddle during the previous seven days. By dusk on Thursdays the acid had done its work and further rainfall serve to dilute the puddle, and it seems to bubble and fizz and fumin froth. We have a record of all that was tossed away to plop into the plop pit for the orphans were charged to maintain logbooks. Here are some telling extract from a recent compilation published by the Pang Hill orphanage documentary archive. I have obliterated the dates through a lack of pernickety Enos, often cast is tracked into the plot pit several lobster pots of no further use since the imposition of the revised sea creature protocol. Often brand up bright and early that day, feeling awful and out to take a turn by that Pang Hill plop pit and tossed into it. Trees cloth trousers rent in many places following Bramble bush and Hornets mishap Often caddy into the pitch propped wrench or add cutters and pincers often fall below Dan Flacco top eggs Oh larks towel concede sprinkler, jack keg lead skansen Punnett all thrown into the pit I plops all sank in the puddle to be forgot. Yet due to the logbooks, nothing is forgotten, tossed away, plopped into the pit, discarded and abandoned and eaten by the janitors acid. Every last item is granted immortality. The orphans themselves have perished. The long line of janitors to the orphanage crumbled to ruin even the battered and burnished and copper and commemorative sign hangs from a single rusty nail and will one day fall and be buried in the muck. Pang Hill itself will be flattened by tectonic shifts or Cataclysm. The sound of the plops though, travels on across unimaginable distances in space and time. And with it, the memory of all it was discarded, was abandoned, of all things.

Just time left this week for a quotation and a little poem. Here's the quotation. This is from an old kind of melancholy reflections on the glass delusion in Europe 1440 to 1680. By Gil speak, the glass man came in a variety of forms. He might be a urinal, an oil lamp, or other glass receptacle, or else he might himself be trapped within a glass bottle. There is a sudden plethora of literary glass men. One of these is Savannah has his glass licentiate Thomas are Dodger, obsessed with the idea that he's made of glass and traumatized by any physical contact. He refuses to wear shoes or any restrictive clothing. He eats only fruit offered to him in a urinal pouch, Vasella the order now on the end of the stick, and drinks fresh water with his hands. He sleeps outdoors, or huddled in some hayloft takes refuge in the country during the storm, and walks in the middle of the street to avoid injury from falling roof tiles. And that's what happens when you think you've made a glass. And finally, a poem. I've been writing a lot of verses recently. And here is one of them. I am a grindy. I have a long beard, and I wear a big hat made of fiber. I sit in a tree and things become weird. When the cogs in my brain start to work. Birds fall from the sky lakes boil the steam hens and chickens come home to roost. I do not ask why. It is not a dream. But the tethers of cents on loosed. The tree is a pine, I put on a bow. My grand Joe will dazzle your sight. I'll give us a sign and give us it now. You cat a wall with all your mind. But I just sit and gesticulate and summon up thunder and storm because I am a get deciding your fate. Your wish you had never been born.

It suddenly occurs to me that I think I've already read that on the show a couple of weeks ago or more. But never mind. You know that's that's the beauty of poems, isn't it poetry, you can memorize it. So send in your answers to the sensible quiz. And go to the website download hooting yards Service Pack six for added fun. And I will be back next week with more of the same including a piece called bashed on the bonds with a sap by a copper bye bye
