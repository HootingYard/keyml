Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. I'm going to begin this week with continuing the story that was left last week with a cliffhanger ending. If you recall, it was a story called tiny Enid and the dustbin of history and timing in it had been searching for the dustbin of history and discovered that it was in fact a large disk waste disposal shoot. At the large flat, windy uninhabited plains municipal hygienic waste disposal should compound in fact, it might be an idea to just read the the final paragraph from last week again and then we can continue to the exciting denouement. The sunless thinking when tiny Enid arrived at a compound surrounded by a security fence. She smiled to herself at the thought that though she may have neglected to bring mountaineers rope and clambering hooks. She never went anywhere without her razor sharp security fence slicing shears dipping into her puppy bag to get them she read assigned a fix to the fence. large flat windy uninhabited plains municipal hydronic waste disposal chute compound it said tiny Enid stamped her clubfoot and let out a shrill cry. the dustbin of history was neither a dustbin nor an ash heap but a shoot. This put an entirely new complexion on her adventure. to salvage those things that had been deemed historical irrelevancies, she would have to find whether chute terminated somewhere subterranean, and she had not brought a spade. One option of course, was to fling herself recklessly down the chute, but that would be like toppling over the edge of the dustbin. She put the tears back in her puppy, she put the shares back in her Pipi bag and sat down to think. She wondered if the lesson to be learned from the answer. The father twinkling his moral conundrum could help her now a burning tower, a starving puppy, the devil incarnate and now add a hygienic waste disposal chute. All of a sudden, tiny Enid knew exactly what to do. She raced back to the apricot pericarp testing station felled the fruit scientist with a few well aimed kicks to the head and the stomach. clamped a bleeping tracker device around his ankle shoved him into a wheelbarrow pushed him west across the plains. disabled the municipal compound alarm system sliced the hole in the security fence and dumped the fruit scientist down the chute. popping a radish into her mouth. she snapped open the tracker device palm pod and watched as the fruit scientists avatar, a cartoon head bearing a striking resemblance to Ringo Starr tumbled beeping deeper and deeper down below the windy plains tumbling and beeping until at last it came to rest of what the coordinates told tiny Enid was the earth core. So this was the dustbin of history. Tiny Enid had attended enough geology lectures to know that the center of the earth is a ball of ferociously hot boiling burning magnetic rock. And that pretty much anything tumbling out of a chute onto it would not survive for a moment. She knitted her brows fretful that her Daredevil mission looked set to end in failure. A word of course the diminutive, adventurous, neither acknowledged nor understood. Turning on her heel, she clumped back across the plains to the landing strip, and steered her way across the skies until she was home. And she sat at her table, scuffing down a bowl of milk slops, resting her clubfoot or a dimity cushion. By the time she had drained her bowl, she had a plan. Part of it would have to wait until the next issue of her favorite comic, the Ipsy Pepsi woo came out, wherein she was sure a moral conundrum from father Ninian twinkling would lead her on the correct path once she had solved it. But the other part of her plan could be set in motion immediately lurching over to the desk upon which our metal Tapping Machine SAT, polished and gleaming. She transmitted message to her mysterious, unseen mentor. I must journey Julie's van like to the center of the earth she tapped and clearly such an expedition will cost a bubble to please start a fundraising appeal immediately. You're sincerely tiny Enid

So this week I'm gonna actually make an attempt to complete all of the stories before the end of the shows and we don't leave you with a with a cliffhanger. See how I get on anyway. This is called meetings with remarkable owls. Dobson's pamphlet meetings with remarkable owls out of print is a curious work. Ostensibly, it's a simple account of a walk he took through the owl sanctuary at screwin hunahpu age, and of the owls he came across they're given the unfathomable depth of his allness illogical ignorance. One is tempted to suggest that the pamphleteer only knew the birds he met with owls because of the big neon signage at the gate of the sanctuary. more remarkable than the owls themselves surely is the fact that Dobson was able to get anywhere near them in the first place. Ever since the so called inexplicably spooky events that centered on screwin hunahpu farmyard, the entire area had been cordoned off by a massive security fence patrolled by wolves and wild hogs. There had always been talk of the eerie fat bomb and the mutant albino hens, and the disturbing well, to say nothing of the farmyard itself, but after what happened on that wild and windy October weekend. So great was the terror in the surrounding villages. The fence was erected overnight, and the wolves and wild hogs let loose around the perimeter. Dobson says nothing of this. were asked to believe that he was out and about pounding the countryside one day when he found himself at the gate of the owl sanctuary and decided to investigate. This cannot be right. To get to the gate. He would first have had to find a way through the security fence without being savaged by wolves or wild hogs, then have had to cross the perilous bogs. Avoid the piano wire strung across the pathways clamber up the impossibly steep sludge banks find his way through the mist in crowded field riddled with concealed pits in which killer spiders lay in white and pass through the notorious spinny of poisonous trees. Even had he accomplished all that he would somehow have had to persuade the century that the owl sanctuary gate that he was a bonafide visitor or they would have shot him on the spot and buried his corpse where it would never ever be found. The centuries were hand picked, undergoing rigorous psychological testing to flesh out any who had a less than fanatical perspective protective instinct towards owls. Dobson was not a particularly boastful man, but he did have an operatic divas sense of drama, and it seems scarcely credible, but he would let pass the opportunity to prattle on about so death defying a journey. So we must be grateful for the research done by indefatigable Dobson just Ted Kak, who's recently published paper suggests that some weird properties in the atmosphere around screen hunahpu farmyard may have actually modified Dobson's brain. One such modification being a complete wiping clean of his memory between eating a truck is at the ramshackle kiosk adjacent to sawdust bridge, an arrival at the gate of the owl sanctuary Three days later. Some traditionalists have have harsh words to say about Ted CAC. After all, he made his name as a young firebrand with a deliberately provocative book, arguing that Dobson was not the true author of the bilgewater elegies. And the pamphleteer never set foot in Winnipeg, let alone work there as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. These were and are preposterous theories, and CAQ himself did himself no favors with his shorty scholarship Cavalier approach to source material and pomposity yet with his Anthony Burgess hairstyle home rimmed glasses and barking voice, it was a natural for television cat shows and even the crusty is Dobson is still speaking or his legendary appearance on Russell haathi plus. TV critic loopy seabag wrote at the time that tab CAC with his Anthony Burgess hairstyle, homerun glasses and barking voice is the best thing I've ever seen on television. Apart from it's a knockout.

In his attempt to unravel what happened to Dobson on the day of his visit to the owl sanctuary, Ted Kak put himself in the pamphleteers stir the Hungarian flying officers boots, and recreated the journey. Of course screwin hunahpu Jews much changed. The whole area around the farmyard has been flattened, and there's no longer any sign of the airy barn or the disturbing well, or the albino hens, or indeed of the owl sanctuary. in their place, standard derelict and abandoned shopping precinct in which feral beasts and teenagers cavort and Carew's. Only a branch of the plumbing train spigots, R Us remains open, and its stock is covered in dust and breadcrumbs. characteristically, Ted Kak was undeterred. he'd read a lot of books about psycho geography, and no he did not really understand what he read. He was determined to pretend to be the pamphleteer in that place at that time on that day, so many years ago, so much so that he prepared by eating a breakfast of bloaters and wearing a grubby pair of trousers. And just as the painter Oskar kokoschka have a life sized rag doll made to replace his last love Alma mala, Ted Kak created a simulacrum of marigold to using string and warm and scrunched up dish cloth and waved it goodbye as he crashed out of the door on his way to sawdust bridge. The crucial paragraph in his research paper is this. There I stood, he wrote in a puddle outside a boarded up milk bar where once at the gate of the screen hunahpu owl sanctuary. I have absolutely no idea how I got here. It was as if my brain had been modified in some sinister way and my memory wiped clean. This leads me to the irrefutable conclusion that exactly the same thing happened to Dobson. And that's why he never wrote about his perilous journey in his pamphlet meetings with remarkable owls out of print. What I do not yet know is how permanent this brain modification will prove to be. God helped me. Well, I can't see any holes in this argument whatsoever. So I'm prepared to state that Ted Kak pompous and irritating as he may be, has solved one of the enduring mysteries of the pamphlet his career. As for the pamphlet itself, as I said, it's a curious work. trudging through the owl sanctuary. dopson from time to time comes across an owl perched upon the branch of a tree. He attempts first to describe it, and this is where his lack of ornithological knowledge lets him down. Each description consists almost entirely of the woods, head, beak, wings, big round eyes, talents and hooting sound in various combinations. But it's the second part of each meeting to which we turn we're in Dobson tries to, as he puts it, commune with the owls he hoots at them, He flaps his arms as if their wings he pounces upon a squirrel or a field mouse and savages it and swallows it. He hoots again. I am Dobson he writes, and for today, at least I am become an owl. It is I think, not the owls which are remarkable in this instance, but Dobson himself

showing the splendid effort To put into thematic uniformity or something like that here, or segues from one piece to another, and this this had this pick this next piece has a bearing on the last piece, which will become obvious. I hope. It's actually one of the famous hooting art folk songs, but I won't sing it to you. I'll just read it. The cherry tricked farmer's wife went to market for to buy a cow. She already had a goat and a hen and a laminate hog and a sound. She wanted a cow so she would have a daily supply of milk, and she wanted some worms to provide her with a goodly amount of silk. But the only worms for sale that day were those of the earth and the tape. And the cow she paid good money for was not quite the usual shape. It was a cow in the form of a bear and it stood on its hind legs, and rather than providing her with milk, it laid weird furry eggs for the market to which the farmer's wife went with a market exceeding odd, where all the beasts were blasphemous offenses against God. There were spiders with horns, and three legged crows and giraffes from the gates of Hades, and owls spawn from mud and geese with ears and basil discs to frighten the ladies. The gentleman were terrified to buy the pig with 10 million eyes and the bloated sacks with razor wings which swoop down from the skies towards market day in screwed Hoon Puj when the godly tremble and pray for the devil sells his monsters on screen hunahpu market day.

Here's something else that should take us I think to the end of the show. I hope it's not gonna overrun, which means I'll have to continue it next week. Anyway, here it is. Once upon a time there was a Baron who was completely potty. His head was roughly the same size and shape as most heads you'll come across. But the stuff that went on inside it spongiform crannies was deeply, deeply weird. To give one example, sometimes when the Baron looked in the mirror, he saw a swans staring back at him. Granted in those days, looking glasses were rarely as smooth and as free of flaws as those that are manufactured by the great mirror makers of modern times. But barons and swans were pretty much the same as they are now. So one can't really blame the looking glass for the Baron's visual delusion. It's not as if he had a particularly long or strenuous neck either which might have been some excuse. Like his head, his neck was unremarkable, and could have been mistaken for anybody else's neck at a glance or in dim light. And the light was often deeming those days in his baronial baileywick for they did not have electric light bulbs or fluorescent strip lighting or Klieg lights or any of the other immensely illuminating benefits of our day. What they did have what candles, have tallow, or blubber, or occasionally beeswax if the bees were happy at their work, so the artificial light the Baron had in his castle was of a flickering and smoky nature, and much so very much of the castle was steeped in shadow and gloom, for candles could not be placed everywhere. That would have been too expensive and too much of a fire risk. By the standards of the time the Baron was a wealthy Baron, but even he couldn't afford to light up so enormous a castle. Perhaps he'd gone nuts because the castle was so bloody big. There must have been times when he got lost roaming around the place looking for one of his toilets or pantries or dining halls or rumpus rooms. The thing about this barren was that he lived alone, shunning the company of courtiers and sycophants and hangers on and even if servants. It was unusual in those days for anyone to know such solitude unless they were clapped in a dungeon somewhere for a grain theft. In those circumstances, the villain could be trapped into an Uber yet and trained to it toward an all but abandoned safer once a day having a moldy loaf and a pig's bladder filled with brackish water thrown down to them. At least they got fed, whereas the potty Baron had to fend for himself. Fortunately, his pantries were very well stocked his uncle, the previous Baron had not been potty at all. He was a careful and calculating kind of Baron who made use of his reason, and laid up so many supplies to guard against famine and war and pestilence that he could have lived on the contents of his pantries for hundreds of years. But of course, not even in those days did people live so long, no matter what you might have read in stories.

The potty barons uncle was barely 40 years old when he died after being kicked in the head by a rampaging hog. He's had to had been of a standard size and shape, but it certainly wasn't after the Hulk had done with it. I'll spare you the details because you might be sick. The Baron vomited all over the shop when he was brought to view his uncle's hog dented head. It looks unnatural and misshapen. Like a Frankenstein experiment gone awry. The potty Baron would not have put it in those words himself, of course, for this was hundreds of years before Mary Shelley was even born. But the idea of somebody or something creating artificial life was already present in the barons potty head. He was ahead of his time in that sense, though, it would be more accurate to say that he was out of his time out of any time is existing as he did in the kind of weird and bonkers days with little or no purchase on reality. Every so often, the notion notions sloshing around inside his head made sense, as was the case with his vow upon inheriting the baronetcy to expel all the hogs from the castle. What he might lose in future hog meat banquets, he would gain in not getting his head kicked in, and an untimely demise. Thus, he acquired the services of Skippy a perky little dog, which chased all the hogs away, petrified as they were by it, Yap. The Baron gave Skippy of tabares to were made out of whole cloth to advertise its official baronial status. But once the hogs were driven out, the Baron group irritated by Skippy and had him placed in kennels never again was any living thing to share the enormous castle with the potty Baron, except for tiny, barely visible insect and a great variety of bacteria. where his uncle had maintained an army of druggies armed with mops and pails, and the most up to date cleaning substances available to a Baron of long ago. His reclusive nephew seemed quite content to allow filth and muck to cake every castle surface. The poem was indescribable, but the potty Baron was impervious to it. As he tended to wander his domain with plugs of fine linens stuffed up his nose. Like the rest of his head, there was nothing out of the ordinary about his nose that had a somewhat core vine cast. He removed his linen plugs when out and about in the open air, striding along the battlements or taking a turn around the moat in a rowing boat. In his uncle's day, the water in the moat had been channeled from a burbling spring and then neighboring Dell, and many fat and healthy fish swam within it, waiting all their lives to be yanked out by a baronial angler and taken to the kitchen and fried for the barons breakfast. The potty Baron had dismissed the anglers as he rid himself of everybody else, and he stopped up the channel from the bubbling spring, and now the water in the moat was stagnant and all the fish and perished and only slimy green tendrils of weed would be found there. In places that weed was so thick, the potty Baron had to roll with all his might to force his rowing boats through it. This proved to be splendid exercise, and was one of the reasons why the Baron did not waste away in his germ ridden solitude. He especially liked to roll around the moat during cataclysmic storms, daring lightning to strike him. He would even shout at the sky as he rode struggling through the glass of moat weed in the night, his cries louder than the thunder, but not once he was not but not once was he struck. The castle though was regularly sometimes catching fire as a result, just as it would have done had the potty Baron been able to fill every inch of it with candles. These fires never took hold. Invariably, they burned themselves out conquered paths by damp and mold and puddles. There were hundreds of puddles within the castle for most of the rooms and ceilings had rotted away, and when the rain poured down, as it did most days, for this was a very wet country. It ports straight down into the toilets and pantries and dining halls and rumpus rooms. Forming puddles.

The potty Baron splashed through them like a duck. Certainly his movements were more akin to those of a duck than to a swamp, such as the one which glared back at him from his Looking Glass. Occasionally, they did not always see a swan in the mirror. Sometimes he saw himself linen plugs in his core via nose, eyes curiously resembling those of a coquettish quarter Zan, hair matted and adorned with berries and string. I saw other times the most terrifying times he saw nothing at all in the mirror. When this happened, the potty Baron would tremble and shriek had he known of vampires, he might have thought himself one, but as we know, these be found in Cape Transylvanian and never visible in mirrors. But the barons castle was very very far away from Transylvania, and he had never heard these tales are not even within his demented cranium had the thought of a blood sucking count of exclusively nocturnal habits, who cast neither shadow nor reflection ever presented itself. As far as the potty Baron was concerned, on those days when his mirror was blank, he assumed he did not exist. It was the awful horror of mortal obliteration, which caused his trembling and shrieking. He learned albeit slowly to overcome his mind snapping fear by turning away from the looking glass and heading straight for the nearest pantry, there to stuff himself with some of the foods preserved by his canny uncle. He would eat so much that he would eventually fall asleep, and when later he awoke crumbled in a heap on the pantry floor, surrounded by crumbs and stalks and pips, he simply stood up and dusted himself off and went about his day or night, whichever one it was shoving the memory of his dreadful annihilation into a pocket of his potty brain. Then he would avoid mirrors for days or weeks, keeping as much as possible to those parts of the castle where there were no looking glasses, or were those that had existed in his uncle's day had been smashed, or just shattered by themselves through neglect and hopelessness. One such place was the castle Belfry, the old Baron and all the barons before him, had run the castle bells for a purpose to celebrate a victory in battle, to warn of plague or to summon the peasantry to come and pay their tithes and taxes and the pain of being flung into dungeons. Not one of the things was of the remotest concern to the potty Baron, whose baffling interior world was oblivious to them. When he set the bells peeling, it was quite unfathomable, and he may have been warding off sprites, or calling them anti him or any of 1000 other incomprehensible reasons. And yet, his bell ringing was surprisingly melodious. We can surmise that it may have sounded not unlike a Shostakovich Symphony, or a Gabrielle for a sonata for cello and piano done by bells. A fall in the field, the peasants hearing the Paki barons carillon would cease their hoeing and grubbing, a mop the sweat from their brows and glanced at each other 1000 years of rustic wisdom shining from their eye sockets, and they might then form a ring in the field, mud caked hands holding mud caked hands, and they would bow their heads and regard the clock soil they work day in day out all their lives as the rain poured down upon their heads. Heads, for the most part have the same normal size and shape as those that have the barren, safer a few peasants with Microsoft phallic or macro phallic, or hydrates or phallic heads, who, despite their condition, still tilled and plowed and scrambled with all the other peasants tirelessly. modally soaked by rainfall in their peasant rags, frayed and filthy from dawn to dusk, and often through the night beset by demons of the darkness, working the land with broken spades and blunted forks, and desperately with sticks and twigs and icy winds and stoop together in their field, forming a circle. They snuck the wax out of their ears and listened. Each one of them thinking the potty Baron is clanging his belt, and all shall be well in this life, and all will be well in the life to come.

And that's it from hooting after this week. I hope you enjoyed it back next week. Bye bye.
