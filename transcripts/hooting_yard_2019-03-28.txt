resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com hooting out on the air. Frankie. Take one. Well, more like take. God knows how many. I can't remember how many shows there have been in about a week or two, two weeks, I think it will be the 15th anniversary of hooting out on the air, which is a rather frightening thought that's long enough for two Jesuit education's plus one year. Mike, is that what you will have many, many years ago, so long ago that you were probably not yet born. There was a cake and pastry person who drove a van around Pang Hill and blister lane, tooting the horn in the summer afternoons, for it seemed the sun was always shining in those faraway days. These were times when children still bought cakes and pastries from a van, a big pan technicon painted yellow and red and pink and mogan black. It was also of course, a time when people worship the hideous bad God fatso and walked the earth in fear of his flapping wings and his shrills squeaking that turned up the innards and piste the soul. Were in other lands, the roads would be lined by milestones, telling the distance to an important town or port. Here there were hundreds and hundreds of huge stone carvings of fat on the visible reminder of his terrible and terribly haphazard power. Children were protected from the worst of his Roth. For facto the bad God did not fully reveal himself until a person reached adulthood. For tinies the stone statues were simply part of the landscape like trees or kiosks or pneumatic power towers. Although the back garden is forgotten today, everyone remembers the resin hoops that were the favorite placing of young and older like, I'm sure you know the words to the old song, we skip and frolic and Loop The Loops along Tang hill with our resin hoops. We skip and frolic on blister lane with our resin hoops we loop again. Sometimes children would play it tossing the hoops over a fatso statue, giving the back God a necklace. Everyone knew that a hoops resin once resting around the stone neck of the God would begin immediately to rot and that by the next morning, nothing would remain but a squelchy foul smelling string of gluten this gooey, dripping dripping onto the ground, where soon vile, prickly poisonous weeds would sprout. These were the roads up and down which the cake and pastry persons van would trundle slowing to a halt whenever a little crowd of tinies gathered each child clutching a cake and pastry token. In an excited gaggle the children would exchange their tokens for cakes and pastries. And the cake and pastry person would collect the tokens in his token tin, which rattled when he shook it and shake it he did to hear that pleasing rustle rattle the beam that the children as he handed out his cakes and pastries and took their tokens and rattled his token tin. But an acute observer might see that the beam was false. Or Rictus grin for the cake and pastry person was plunged in melancholy. He remembered the innocent times when he too, had been able to eat cakes and pastries without a care. Now like every adult in the land, his days were consumed by a desperate need to allocate fat so the hideous back God.

It seemed that fatso needed more and more tokens every day. And the cake and pastry person was seldom satisfied until his 10 was so crammed with tokens that it no longer rattled. Only then could he cease driving his Pan technicon round and round the road and park by the perimeter fence of the swan sanctuary and take his 10 on foot along the lane to fat toes cave and white with all the other supplicants for night to fall on for the bat God's lieutenants to Shema interview. Why not last his turn came, he would empty the tin into the outstretched paws of a greedy and grasping Lieutenant, and plead for benediction. But benediction rarely came. Tomorrow, a bigger 10 more tokens. Last was he commanded in the horrible high pitched squeals of fat toes in human myrmidons one by one then they would flit away with their booty into the deepest, darkest recesses of the cave, and the cake and pastry person and all we ever hunched and sorry believers would traipse away back to their huts and shacks and cabins and try to snatch a few brief hours of sleep before dawn broke, and they faced a new day with redoubled effort. As they slept, the resin hoops rotted on the statues of them back God. poisonous weeds crept and curled along the ground, and in the nurseries and the cover of the night. Tiny children giggled with delight, happy that they had bolstered fat size power for another day. Sure in the knowledge that tomorrow would bring more looping loop with their resin hoops, more sunshine, and more cakes and pastries. From the cake and pastry persons yellow and red and pink and move and black cake and pastry van

What better way to spend a wet bank holiday afternoon and to curl up in front of the television to watch a trilogy of films by one of the great unsung otres of the silence screen. The cable TV channel UK golden pap is to be congratulated for screaming the Masterworks of the great and greatly misunderstood Pabst TAC. When tax films are mentioned, which is rarely, they're dismissed as fake tweet confections for children. In an age when childhood was seen as a time of purity and innocence class the damning rebuke of a cravat wearing pipe smoking goatee bearded critic like john both, who wrote with these insipid pieces of froth, perhaps to attack. Not aid not only drains his films of sound and color, but also of plot, tension, engagement, disturbance of life and death and sex. What BAF says is true, yet he fails to understand just how radical an approach perhaps does tak took yes, these films are indeed feigned twee, yet at the same time there cloying and saccharin, miraculously, inoffensive, whimsical in the most nauseating sense of the word. The first in the trilogy is Pepe the pony goes to the paddling pool. The part of puppy with play by tax own pony poopy, a placid well groomed little darling with gossamer ribbons flowing from its main in silent black and white. We want just Pippi Cantor's towards a paddling pool and splashes about gently and charmingly. There are no fancy camera angles. No clever, clever montage look tacky saying a pony in a paddling. He followed this up with Buffy the Africanized killer bee joins us warm. In this possibly the finest of the three films biffi played by Pabst TAC pet Africanized killer bee Laetitia is shown buzzing around a municipal flower bed, then going off to draw in a swarm of her fellows. Tax camera is static except the very end when it pans to show Buffy journey from solitude to companionship. mosfilm is the one where perhaps this tak takes the greatest risks with his creative vision. With schmoopy the vampire bat sucks the lifeblood from a consumptive often, the task of retaining a quintessentially tak s tweeners must at times have seemed impossible. But once again, the OTA intact pulls it off in a magnificently sugar coated fairy cake of a film. schmoopy by the way, was played by Pabst as tags own vampire bat. Flopsy, while the part of the consumptive often went to a doe eyed and consumptive often, the director found swooning and crumpled, clutching weekly at the railings of Pang Hill orphanage during a blizzard. If there is a better way to spend seven hours on a wet bank hollaby afternoon than watching these films by for one last to know what it might be.

For a long time I used to go to bed early. I was exhausted from long days working as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. There are those who think that being a janitor is an easy life. Excuse me. A little more than a matter of rattling a set of keys, sloshing a mop among a curried or floor and glaring reproachfully at all who passed by. There may be genesis of that kidney, but I was not that kind of janitor, and never had been neither in this nor in any of my earlier Genesis ships. It's a curious fact that the building in which I have been a janitor buildings in which I've been a janitor have all housed milk related activities. Before being appointed to my post in the evaporated milk factory, I worked at a condensed milk canning plant and milk of magnesia Research Laboratory and a milk slops slopping tank. When I was younger, I relaxed application and was frequently reprimanded on a carpet as is usually the case by my superiors. The overseer of the slop inch tank was particularly rancorous as I recall, but by the time I fetched up at the evaporated milk factory, I took my duties seriously, excessively so and that was why I was exhausted at the end of the day. To be precise, I was exhausted before the end of the day, hence my going to bed early. There is a pamphlet by Dobson entitled tips for janitors out of print, which helped to mend my ways. One boiling hot summer Sunday at a loose end, I went to visit a dying janitor in a Mercy Home. his brow was beetle and his jaw was a lantern, and he was slowly perishing from a malady which could set in after an attack of the bindings and which he could not shake off due to his advanced age. It was not entirely clear just how old he was Fey's birth certificate had been destroyed by worms. He certainly looked unbelievably ancient. When I went to see him on that boiling hot day, propped up in a sort of collapsible medical chair, surrounded by dripping foliage, like general stern wood in the Big Sleep. He had made a vain attempt to mask his decrepitude by dyeing his hair black with boot polish, and by sporting the type of T shirt worn by young Japanese trendies. Neither ploy for me. I knew I was looking at a janitor who had began his career in the age of gasoline. mantle's and steam. My visit was prompted by a plea from the charitable board for janitors close to death, seeking volunteers to pay social calls on janitors close to death to brighten their last days. I thought myself to the goobric has to be suitable for such a good deed. But the board's director, an ex flapper by the name of Mimsy henbane, said that this particular dying janitor rejoiced in the lagu breus and few near real and bleak and that my presence would lift his spirits like the Italian castrato opera singer Luigi marquese 1754 to 1829, who, irrespective of the party was playing, insisted on making his stage entrances on horseback wearing a helmet with white feathers several feet long. I'd like to cat something of a dash when entering a Mercy Home. On this particular Sunday, I was in smothered in fine, kingly rayment, complete with the pelt of a Wolverine gulo gulo, the largest landed dwelling member of the weasel family, a burnished golden helmet marquese would have died for an A bauble or two.

It was stiflingly hot, of course, but my blood is ice cold. And I had achieved a temperature a temporary equilibrium, as I strode majestically into the greenhouse, where in the dying janitor awaited me. And I'm unable to tell me his name, not because I do not know it, but because I found it completely unpronounceable. He was of tantau arobin parentage, and bought one of those impossible and I must say foolish names they're so fond of in that land. He was also wearing a pair of dentures which had been designed for a mouth much larger than his. So it was not only his name, I failed to catch. I had brought with me as a gift a bag of extra crunchy hard crunchy herbal crackers. And it looked to me as if those gigantic teeth would be more than a match for the crunchiness. Indeed, they were for a few minutes as the dying janitor shoveled the crackers gratefully into his job. It was like being in a hot, damp greenhouse with a snapping turtle. He crunched his way through the whole bag full so rapidly that I wondered if he was ever fed. I had not seen any staff in the Mercy Home, not even a janitor. In fact, I've not seen anyone any other patients. There were some pigs in the sky between the green house and the main building, but otherwise the place seemed deserted. One of the things I've always liked about people from tan tower beam is that they're so easy to rub along with. After he had sculpted crackers. The dying janitor sat there smiling weekly, but I suppose contentedly while I loomed above him, Magoo, breus and few near real and bleak, just as Mimsy henbane had suggested. I decided to stay on till his smile faded, and prop myself against a pane of glass, having first twisted the dyeing Janice's neck round slightly, so I was still within his sight. It felt good to be doing something selfless for one who would trodden the path of janitor done before me. I pondered if this was what being a Boy Scout was all about. My only connection with with the toggles tribe had been a single incident in the year of the Tet offensive. When I failed to stop a snack bar hooligan pushing a puny Boy Scout into a lake. I would have intervened but I was preoccupied at the time with recalibrating a mechanism, one of my leisure pursuits in those days when I was an in when I was an indolent janitor, rather than the indefatigable janitor I became at the evaporated milk factory, where I no longer have time nor energy for leisure proceeds of any kind. Despite his Pune illness, the boy scout had passable swimming skills, and he managed to avoid drowning in the lake, a lake in which many had met a watery death. I knew this because their names were inscribed on a plaque affixed to a post at the edge of the lake. And I had bashed the post into the mud myself with a hammer one day many years before when I had nothing else to do. I used to roam the lakes and ponds and there abouts with my hammer, looking for posts to bash into the muck. If I could not find any posts, I became disconsolate and squatted on the nearest available tasik sobbing until it was time to wind my way home. I have plenty of time to dwell upon my past as I leaned against the pane of glass in the hot greenhouse for the dying janitors smile never wavered. It seemed that he was so pleased with the crackers, and with my Magoo. breus presence, that he had entered a state of transcendent bliss. I was determined, however, to keep to my plan of staying with him until he was no longer smiling. I knew Mimsy henbane would approve, and in a sense, it was also a way of a swaging the guilt I still felt about failing to prevent the snack bar hooligan shoving that puny Boy Scout into the lake.

Frank Key  20:56
that had happened many years before, as I've indicated, but as time passed, my conscience gnawed at me with ever increasing ferocity. In those days, far from going to bed early, often I never went to bed at all. Instead, marching up and down countryside lines all night incapable of sleep. I was keeping the same hours as owls. And if nothing else, that fraught Insomniac period helped me to extend my own ethological education. If I was a pamphleteer like Dobson, rather than a janitor, I'm sure I could churn out innumerable essays on owls and other nocturnal birds. As it is, I make do by button holding the occasional evaporated milk factory employee and sharing my bird learning with them, whether they like it or not. It was a pity that the dying janitor was from tan tower beam and wearing dentures far too big for his mouth, and thus would have been unintelligible to me, where he to be prodded into speech, for there was something in his demeanor which told me that he like me was an erudite janitor. I could not guess what his area of expertise was, of course, so I made a mental note to ask Mimsy henbane. When next I called into the charitable board for janitors close to death HQ. Menzies' journey from flapper to charity board director was an extraordinary one. Her story has inspired poets, novelists, composers, filmmakers and creative Titans in just about any field you can think of. Not least the designers of T shirts worn by young Japanese trendies. Dennis Pierpont tried a series of cantos about her. Anthony Burgess struggled for years with a novel based on her life, but was forced to abandon it when he concluded that such your work was beyond his imaginative powers. an opera booth by Booth was inspired by her. Dan Brown is apparently working on a pop board called the Mimsy henbane code. Before his untimely death, Raina van Fassbinder planned a film about her set in a tough forum dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. The list goes on. Yet intriguingly not one of these works based on her life ever addressed the root cause of her devotion to Janice's close to death. There is always plenty about her flat bottom and about the Antarctic Expedition, the beekeeping the shipwreck, the surgical interventions, the gladsome spring and the buffets of autumn, the postage stamp mystery, the years of crime, the gutter perfect interlude, the bittersweet romances, the collapsed lung, the other collapse prolong the delicate little fist beating helplessly against wooden panels in the heart in the forest, the evil chickens. The Gordie Boudreau, the Karen Carpenter incident, the vandalism, the scuba diving, the pitfalls, the obelisk, the gravel pathways, the euphonium band, The pint of milk, and the gruesome business in the tough foreign dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. Yes, janitors dying or otherwise, not one word. I know because I've checked before I started working myself to exhaustion in the evaporated milk factory. I was able to spend some of my leisure time making a thorough study of all the Mimsy henbane related books and films and plays and Opera booths and trendy Japanese t shirt, etc. From beer pod to budges from booth to Brown, No creative Titan, this demon janitors worthy of a mention. I try not to take this personally and deny that I have pinned into miniature wax effigies of many of those named or of any others such as Harrison Birtwistle and Salman Rushdie and the paperback is pebble head during spooky midnight ceremonies where I have been joined by jabbering counting who did blood soaked, wild eyed, whirling, drooling, drugged up maniacs. In any case, whatever the good breus dismay I may feel towards those who have ignored my profession

Frank Key  25:40
is more than outweighed by the fact that Mimsy henbane herself, devoted her latter years to my kind. And she did so selflessly. Apart from the excessive fees she charged to those who are lucky enough to find the haven in one of her mercy homes, or in one of the green houses next to the pigs dies in one of her mercy homes and the extra charges. She levied on the relic, two of those janitors who dying died and passed into the realm of which we know not. So despite my hours of study, I'm as clueless as the next janitor as to Mimsy, Mimsy motives, all I know is that she fully deserved my gratitude, and that's why I stood leaning against a pane of glass in that greenhouse, while a dying janitor propped up in a collapsible medical chair. His hair slathered in boot polish, and his dentures too big for his mouth, smiled at me for three whole days. I did it for mimsey

Frank Key  26:50
there is actually more of that story, which maybe I'll read to you next week. So we'll leave it with the Magoo breus janitor leaning against the pane of glass. Looking lugubriously. The dying janitor in the chair. The janitor from tantaran been it's it's quite a thrilling story I feel with much incident and much emotional heft. I know that when I wrote it. When I first wrote it, I felt it really wrenched at my heartstrings in a big way. Southern I wept copious buckets. I hope you're not weeping copious buckets of tears. But if you are dabit them with a napkin and go off and do something else, or stay and continue listening to resonance. We're up next we'll be out of globe. And we might even hear something from john. In the meantime, between shows, I don't know but like to thank him for having produced the program and pansy cradle jus who's been doing live knitting throughout. So I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
