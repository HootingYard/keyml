Good evening. This is resonance while Oh 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. If you're listening on a digital device, my name is Frank key. This is hosting yard on the air. And to start the show this week. pansy cradle drew is going to tell you about john Ruskin and can Russell

Unknown Speaker  00:49
Ruskin john, English writer 1819 to 1900. As a child Ruskin was not allowed any toys. His favorite pastime was digging holes in the garden, but he was not allowed to do that either. As a treat on Sundays, he was allowed to jump off his favorite box. He had a lifelong loathing of invalids, prompted initially by his cousin Margaret, who, apart from having a twisted spine, wore her hair and ringlets which Ruskin could not bear the sight of. Russell Ken, English film director 1927 to 2011 according to Glenda Jackson, the only direction Russel ever gave to his actors was to say it needs to be a bit more earthy. Or a bit less, huh.

Frank Key  02:21
Is the show or boy, huh? JOHN house john can share with us another director's directing technique. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  02:33
I saw a clip of john waters, directing, I think pink flamingos and he just said, David act more

Frank Key  02:46
marvelous Thespians. I there's all sorts of stuff like that isn't there about when? When that were when they were making marathon man, and Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman were acting together. And apparently, Dustin, who of course, use the the method was badgering the director with what's my motivation here and what should I do here? And Laurence Olivier just looked at him and said, it's called acting dear boy.

Frank Key  03:37
Right let's let's continue with some pros. This is called the helmsman. Am I not the helmsman here, I called out. Most of you, I hope will recognize this as the opening line of my great speech. It will certainly be familiar to younger listeners who must learn the great speech by rote in their kindergartens. And the when they have it by heart, are they permitted to move on to other central topics, such as pig husbandry, Latin, and knitting? For the older generation, we have made possession of the printed transcript compulsory. There are several editions available, including one with cardboard covers, I know lovely frontispiece featuring a mezzotint by dot tent. Unfortunately, not all of these additions are reliable. Some containing misprints, and even Sorry, I'm not sure why I stopped there, possibly because of my eyesight. Unfortunately, not all of these additions are reliable, some containing misprint and some willful interpolations serving to twist my words there have been several actions executions, the jibbitz a top polka dot Hill. As is well known, I delivered the great speech while standing at the helm of a barge on an important stretch of canal, the better to illustrate my point for the thickos in the audience. They probably comprised about 90% of those gathered on the towpath, if not more, it is quite astonishing to recall that in those antebellum days, the bulk of the population competed completed their six months of kindergarten, completely unable to husband a pig speak Latin or net. But things have changed and credit must be given to my great speech. It was during it was majestic. It was very loud and it took four hours to deliver. It was punctuated as all my speeches are with copious spitting. Before I began speaking, I had the earwax squad move among the crowd with their little wooden ear products to ensure every last sicko peasant will hear me properly by might not understand half of what I said or any of it, but at least the words will enter their ears on muffled by wax. I was pleased with the rhetorical flourish at the beginning of my speech, partly because I was daring anyone in the crowd to contradict me. Doing so was made the more difficult by my standing at the helm of the barge wearing about green cap, but you can never be sure with the peasantry. As it was nobody did try to deny that I was the helmsman, so I was able to proceed without polls. I explained that the old days were over and quoting Blair decided a new dawn has broken, declared, a new dawn has broken has it not? Again inviting contradiction. No voice was raised against me. So I pressed on. From now on, there would be more and better pig husbandry. Latin would be the lingua franca. Idle hands will be forced to knit a special special new knitting camps fence with barbed wire. I outlined other exciting features of the new dorm covering everything from albatross slaughter to Zoo regulations with 24 other alphabetically ordered areas of urban and rustic life in between. I'm not sure frankly, why I bothered to include urban matters, because the peasants gathered by the canal side to hear me with a sort of peasant who faced with something urban like a pavement or a street bike, or civic art installation would fight or swoon or just topple over in uncomprehending mental chaos. Indeed, quite a large proportion of the crowd listen listening to my great speech seemed similarly brain the dies and they stood there dropping open mouthed dribbling and drooling a slouching bunch of dim width. These are the riffraff my regime of the new dawn will mold into a terrifically energetic and Stakhanovite pig husband does Latin speakers and knitters.

Frank Key  08:36
That at least was the plan. But and it's a huge but do they ever think or are they only or do they only shuffle pointlessly over the earth? The first sentence in the last were translated from the German by Tanya and Jane stern. Everything in between with not

Frank Key  09:26
and this story is called crackles and errands. We were camping in the oasis. We were in one of those so called New tent camping and by the new campus, the new camping movement took its inspiration.

Frank Key  09:53
Excuse me. The new camping movement took its inspiration partly from the kiboko gift, and partly from an obscure beside of the 45 RPM single by the captain and tenille in which the Winston Guo sang of the joy of, quote, new camping in our new tent with our new camping gas stove. Unquote. We had a new tent. Unfortunately, we did not have a new camping gas stove and had to make do with an old one to cook our sausages. My two companions was soil heads, but I'm not a trendy person, and I still own and use a comb. One day pairing out through the new flap of our new tent we saw passing by in the near distance an Arab leading a jackal on a leash Hey, they're called out one of my companions. Let's Let's call him soil had one. Come over here with your least Draco one share our cocoa and sausages. As he approached, we saw that the Arab was an old man, much better wrinkled and creaking. You are very kind he said. Though I am old my jackal. Here is one of these so called New jackals we've been hearing so much about lately. We confessed that we had heard not a jot about new jackals Well, he said the mobile library will be stopping by this Oasis on Thursday morning. They should have in stock the latest issue of stuff occurring in the desert magazine. In it you will find a feature article about new jackals a short while ago. One of its reporters interviewed me and the Mohammedan mezzotint is dot out tint executed a mezzotint of my jackal I was given to understand the picture will appear on the magazine's cover. We promised to consult a copy on the coming Thursday, and reasons any questions we might have about older new jackals could wait until then. There was a lull in the conversation. We chewed our sausages and slurp dark cocoa. This would be an opportune time to tell you something about soil head to when we set out on our desert crossing. He was a complete stranger to both me and to soil had one. We had encountered him at a souk. He used to wear fedoras, but now he sported affairs. They were cabbalistic innuendos in everything he said. A soil head in affairs with quite a novelty even at that time, soil had one who knew more than most about the Kaaba was able to untangle innuendos to some extent. So we'll head to told us very little about himself, grubbing exasperated by our questions. he conceded eventually that there was an entry for him in the dictionary of national biography that he said would tell us all we needed to know about him and more. It was soil had one sharp as a tack, who counted that one needs to be dead before one can be included in the dictionary of national biography. In reply, soil head to looked up at the sky, pointed and said, Oh look, a common name of a type of bird I'm afraid I've forgotten. As ever ornithology serve to distract us on the subject of soil heads to the life and possible death was never raised again. Now in the lounge outside our new tent, the Oasis, we noticed that saw head to was staring fixedly at the jackal, and the jackal was staring fixedly at soil head to where they just gazing each other, or were they communicating by some telepathic means akin to that employed by Mr. Spock in the television series, Star Trek. Whatever was going on between them came to an abrupt end when the Arab tugging on the jackals the link explained that he had important sand based things to do elsewhere in the desert, and must be on his way. He thanked us for the Coca Cola and sausages reminded us to read up on new jackals in stuff occurring in the desert magazine and trudged Creek away away. Jacqueline told

Frank Key  14:46
a few days passed without incident. Soil had to seemed strangely quiet, but we noticed he was growing increasingly irritated with our old camping gas stove, then on Wednesday, The day before the mobile library which drew he announced that he knew of a large desert department store where we would be able to buy one of the new stoves soil had one and I had no reason to suspect him of ill intent. So we happily packed up our things unset off across the sand, betting soil head to lead the way. We marched across the boiling sands for the best part of the day, until towards nightfall, we arrived at an airstrip. There were no airplanes no control tower, and nor was there a department store soil had to walked determinately along the strip and came to a halt and a gaping pit. baffled we watched him carefully as he began to wave his arms in strange flows significant passing movement over the pit, while babbling guttural incantatory mumbo jumbo. Suddenly, a plume of black smoke belched forth from the pit, and we were amazed to see stepping out of it, the old Arab he no longer had a jackal on a leash, unnervingly his own head was that of a jackal. Or Ohio I Lubis cried soil head to Greetings Mr. Crowley barked a new birth. Please call me Alistair said the man we had thought our new camping companion. Very well. Alistair Crowley. I see standing behind you. A couple of nitwits? Yes, oh great a new birth. I thought it will be fun to make of the sacrifice to the powers of darkness, death, Doom, despair and destruction. That's a great idea to have a stare. But wait. And the Draco headed God made strange slow, significant passing movements of his own. And out of the pit came leaping and bounding dozens upon dozens of savage gapping grounds that says push your little pals into the pit until we have prepared ourselves for the full awfulness of the sacrifice, said the God. And so soil had won and I were pushed into the pit. That was six days ago. We can hear Alistair Crowley and a new bit, assembling their horrible equipment. We have no chance of escape above us in a ring around the pit of the jackals. They are barking and yapping and slavering and gazing down on us, and how they hate us. The first sentence and the last were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Moore, and everything in between was not

In his later years, he produced amateur dramatic stage versions of his works with goofy casting.

Frank Key  19:33
departure I ordered my horse to be brought from the stables. His name is Alan. He is an elegant horse, but tubercular is shanked admirable, and he has as fine a mean as any horse in Christendom. The stableboy A pockmarked little squirt who bore a distinct resemblance to the young starlin came limping out. His face was drained of any color. Alan is gone, gone, vanished, as if in a puff of smoke, he cried and began to weep. I cannot bear the sight of a weeping stable boy. I cannot bear the sight of a weeping stable boy, I cried, stop sniffling and I grabbed a finger sharply into one of his pox. I found this immensely satisfying, so I grabbed my other seven fingers, one by one into seven of his other pox. Now, I said, you will go and find out when the mobile library is parked outside the birdseed shop on love and goat lane. In the library, you will find a horse Atlas, borrow it using your library ticket. The horse Atlas contains many maps showing those parts where horses of different complexions and beauty are located. It is likely Allen has galloped to one such part of our land workout which using the horse knowledge you have acquired as a stable boy, get the hens and fed him back using a lasso if need be. I was pleased with this little speech, almost as pleased as I was grabbing my fingers into his pocket. So I took myself off to the tavern for well deserved refreshment. When I arrived at the tavern on up a goat lane, I discovered that it was under new management and had been turned into a trendy milk bar, within which dozens of beatniks were playing bongos and reciting terrible poetry. As I sipped my tumbler of milk, I jotted down the words of one of the poems I heard. I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical naked because their horses had gone missing from the stables, but they were in luck because I could send some pockmarked stable boy who looked like the young starlings off in search of their horses, armed with a horse Atlas from the mobile library. For some reason I found that this poem spoke to me in a way the other beatnik twaddle did not. Perhaps it was because I was one of the best minds of my generation. I had a trophy to prove it, a cup I had been given in my infant school. The full wording act on the cup was another poem. Best mind your cup out child so tiny. If you break it, you will be windy. And if you wind on St. spirax Day, the grumpy man will take you away.

Frank Key  23:00
I have actually been taken away by the fist. I'm an awful grumpy man at the age of six. But he grew so exasperated by my constant whining that he brought me back again later the same day. As I sat in the groovy milk bar. I could only hope that the stable boy would bring Alan the horse back just as quickly. He truly turned up several hours later, by which time I had drunk so much milk and listened to so much terrible poetry, accompanied by bongos that I was burning. That I was burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the story Dynamo in the machinery of Knight, who poverty in tatters and hollow wide and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold water flat, floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz. The stableboy had brought me a horse, but it was not Alan. It was neither elegant nor tubercular it shanked were despicable, and its main was nothing to write home about. That horse is not Alan, I cried. It is neither elegant nor tubercular it Shanks, a despicable and it's main there's nothing to write home about. Sorry, said the stable boy. I visited many, many, many of the places on the maps in the horse Atlas, and this is the best I could do. I was minded to drag my fingers in his pocket again, but I restrained myself. Take the new horse to the stables and saddle it up. I said, I will be along shortly for I have miles to go before I vomit up all his milk and go to sleep. The stableboy plotted off with the horse in tow, and I drank another tumbler of milk and listen to another god awful poem accompanied by bongos. When I made to leave I found my way barred by a huge bouncer, beatnik What gives daddy? Oh, he said, you don't want to leave this groovy milk bar. Anyway, we want that you you're the kind of cat we'd love to have hitting those bongos morning noon and night. You really fry my wig. Yes, your stay here forever drinking milk and thumping bongos. Where would you go anyway? I wind out of here. That's my goal. The first sentence and the last were translated from the German by Tanja and Jane stern. and everything in between was not

Frank Key  25:56
at the end of the show, I should just remind you that I will tell you if you don't already know that I won't be here next week because there's I can't remember where there's a special live broadcast from six until I think nine. I can't remember where it's coming from, but I'm sure it's well worth listening to. And it means I get a week off. And to end this week's show. pansy cradle June is going to read you some more brief brief lives. We thought okay, okay.

Well, the end of that particular entry says see your Midge so I will end with your Mitch, Scottish musician born 1953. In March two Mitch years beat combo the Kansas cattle rancher Kirk Dickinson named one of his cows, Ultravox.

Frank Key  28:14

I won't be back next week, but I hope to be back the week after that. Meanwhile, you can always go to hooting yard.org and read this stuff yourself. Or buy lots of paperbacks or in fact a hardback which is the one that pansy cradled us just been reading from, which is Mr. Keys, shorter, potted, brief, brief lives, which somehow failed to be a best seller. God knows why. Anyway, it's still available. Would you like to buy it? And you certainly should. Okay. Bye bye. Oh, and thank you to john, particularly for the john waters anecdote, engineer more
