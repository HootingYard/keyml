Welcome to hooting yard on the air. Mr. Key is with us today. He's currently recuperating from a violent case of bus travel. So I'm going to read the first story to you and he'll be jumping in I'm sure at some point to correct me or continue the the exciting world of hooting yard. So to begin this week, this is Carnival and cat. On a cold wet afternoon in November 1965 awful and Bruce and Judith and Keith, let it be known that the carnival was over. The cat was out of the bag. I was better taught at the time, with only half a dozen summers behind me, but I knew this was a call to action. If I did not do something, where would it end? First things first, I decided to put the cat back in the bag. It was a cloth bag, pink and green with a scattering of yellow dots. Like for dawn rising on a Buttercup splattered Meadow with a drawstring fastener. My mother used it for keeping her buttons in so many buttons until I tip them out near the fireplace. I picked up the bag do it open to its full extent. Impressive forward planning for one so young and went in search of the cat. I waylaid punches. That was the name of the cat by the Wayne Scott and the parlor, picked him up by the scruff of the neck and tried to shove him back into the bag. But lice like most cats, punches was not tractable. And he struggled in my grasp, flailing and clawing savagely at my face. Had a passing snapper photograph the scene, it would have resembled neon parks cover design for the Mothers of Invention album weasels ripped my flesh. Although that picture was not executed until 1970. It would have shown a six year old boy rather than an adult male and the cat rather than a weasel, and would most likely have been black and white rather than full color. Most of my memories of that time are monochrome when I call them to mind, which is more and more often these days. howling I dropped upon chest, who skidded off at high speed towards the cat flap and the open air. I also dropped the bag clutching at my bloody cheek, I went in search of my mother and bandages. restarting the carnival would have to wait a lack of day I was soon distracted by other matters. A tumbler of milk, snakes and ladders picking up buttons. And I quite forgot about the carnival. Only today more than half a century later. Have I remembered that it is up to me to get it started again. I will I will after I've taken a nap

pansy cradled you for reading that autobiographical snippet of mine. It's a completely true story. Now last week, I had started to read you the exciting story of the horrible cave. And I promised that I would continue reading it this week. What's happened so far? I can't remember the details but where we are at is that the narrator having gone towards the horrible cave and then seen a flock of crows coming from the cave has decided to go to the bird inspection bureau the near nearby One and got on a bus in order to get there, but the bus has been at the bus route has been blocked by a preacher man. It's standing in the middle of standing on a crate, I think in the middle of the road. And so our narrator decides he needs to do something about this. And so where are we at?

Frank Key  05:35
Yes. Anyway, no, no sooner had I closed my eyes and the bus break sharply, jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed for which I reprimanded him. He apologized for his return. He then pointed in front of him, and I saw that the road was blocked by a fanatical preacher man, naked from the waist up, caked in filth, standing on a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had never heard before. The driver and I exchanged looks of befuddlement. Then he reached under his seat and hoisted up a rectangular tin which he opened to reveal a clotted mass of stale food. He invited me to share his lunch, but I declined, given that there appeared to be a number of weevils crawling about in it. Their presence did not bother the driver, who began shoveling the food into his mouth. With his surprisingly dainty fingers. I noticed that his nails were painted with bright red lacquer flaking off in places as if it had been applied some time ago. His eating habits were so repulsive, that I turned to look out at the preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now. I decided to get off the bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side of the road. as I got closer to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was mistaken. But no, there was no doubting it. Underneath that caped muck. I recognize my Papa. Papa, I cried, sudden tears streaming down my face. I may as well have been invisible. He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky in his unintelligible tongue, the sky that was now growing black as monstrous clouds swept in from the west. I am tempted to lie and say that my tears were copious, but I have to confess they were not. I sniffled a beta then remembered why I had got off the bus in the first place. It was clear to me however, that asking my papa to shift his barrel out of the road would be futile. I wondered how it would be if I just pushed him over and cleared the way myself. The role here on toppling preacher men are draconian. And the normals here on toppling preacher men are draconian, and I would have to make sure I did not get caught. I judged that the bus driver was too intent on bolting his food and would not be paying attention. If he saw me push my power off the barrel, he would almost certainly inform on me. For we all know the reputation of bus company personnel hand in hand with the police force, at least in this neck of the woods, for obvious historical reasons. As for my papa, would he lie an accusation against his only son, it was a risk I had to take. Just as I was nerving myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a modern fancy which had been nestling, nestling dormant in my brain until that moment. I'm utterly perplexed as to why it suddenly unrolled uncoiled itself as it were, and sprang to the forefront of my mind. casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision so very vivid of myself dressed in rags. exhaustedly swinging a leper Bell from my withered arm. Weird that I slapped myself on the forehead a couple of times to dispel a hallucination came to my senses. yanked my proposed ankle so he fell off the barrel, push the barrel over and roll it to the curb and got back on the bus. The driver had finished his lunch so ever so swerving slightly to avoid my papaw who was sat at the road dusting himself down. He drove me to my stop 10 minutes walk from the bird inspection unit. What I found there was breath did brain dizzying. I arrived at the bird inspectors house. To discover the been engulfed by a tsunami and lay in ruins. A solid three more hand was paddling about where the door used to be. But there was no sign of the inspectors. I fancied that perhaps this might be a talking more him, which could surprise me when I had gone and asked my question in a slow, clear loud voice, as one might use in speaking to a recalcitrant infant. But of course, the more hand was incapable of speak. What was I thinking?

Frank Key  10:35
I felt it more important than ever to track down at least one of the bird inspectors and relay my theory that crows were nesting in the horrible cave with alarming consequences. In my experience, most bird inspectors sport Italianate mustachios and preen them fanatically with oil and waxes. So I decided to head off on foot for the nearest village and seek out a shop selling oils, waxes and other hair treatments. I was in mark for as soon as I strode purposefully into the village, I saw not only such an Emporium, tucked between a wholesaler of dinghies and a clapboard hovel, but a man with Italianate mustachios. Working in the doorway. He was sopping wet, making his moustache droop, but that made it over more likely he had been caught in the tsunami. I hailed him from a distance of some 40 feet. That is the last thing I can remember. I have no idea what happened from that moment until today, three weeks later. So I am told when I found myself sitting in an armchair, staring out at a dying lawn, being prophet cups of tea and mashed potatoes by an overseer receptus nurse. Her name she told me was Primrose. That name rang a faint bell in my memory. I associated it with something petrifying and terrible. But Primrose, the nurse seemed to be neither. In fact, her fawning was getting on my nerves. I wanted to ask her where I was and how I got here, but she had already skipped off to fetch more mashed potatoes. Deciding to follow her. I walked rather unsteadily into a curry door. It was painted a bilious shade of orange and on the walls and framed portraits of members of Jethro Tull, Emerson lake and Palmer and Barclay James harvest, was this some kind of benighted prog rock haven. I should add that these were paintings rather than photographs. Although that's the word I'm looking for is dorbz. My infant child could do better if I had an infant child, but I do not. Long ago I vowed never to bring a new being into the world with a horrible cave in it less the mic should accidentally wander into it. I could not forgive myself if such a thing happened.

Frank Key  13:44
The horrible cave continued. I could hear what sounded like potatoes being mashed, coming from an open doorway over to my left. entering the room, however, I did not find Primrose. Instead, I was confronted by a slobbering guru. It spoke or rather groaned at me in Latin, for it was a Vatican ghoul. atop its gruesome head I could see the tailored the tattered remnants of a Beretta, in which a number of locusts seem to be feeding. Were they eating the gold straggly locks or its priestly hat, or both? I was so fascinated by the Locust that I'm afraid I paid little attention to the gravel with Latin being spouted at me. At this point, Primrose came in. There you are Mr. mctavish. She codes weekly addressing the goal. I've been looking all over for you. It's time for your mashed potato poultice Come with me. There's a deer. She took it by what I can only assume was its arm. stared it away, still groaning. I was rather disconcerted that Primrose and ignored me completely. Perhaps I was being oversensitive. I looked at my wristwatch and saw that it was just coming up to midday. Why in heaven's name was I dressed in pajamas, I opened a cupboard and rummaged around until I found a shiny and brand new boiler suit. I changed into it and checked how I how it looked in the mirror. Noting that it's broad black and yellow hoops gave me a faint resemblance to a giant Be it was time to leave this place, wherever it was. I pranced out onto the lawn and peered around looking for a signpost. I've always been fond of crocus's, and there was a clump of them nearby. In the absence of a signpost, I decided I could do worse than terrier while examining the flowers and leaves and perhaps scrump scrambling in the soil. To have a quick look at the comb on should take one's pleasures as one can. And if I was to stride onward, with a spring in my step, a few minutes contemplation of foliage would come my brain for the inevitable travails ahead. These were early crocus's or krokus Tomasi Ana's, as no doubt the guru could have told me I wondered where abouts on his grisly frame Primrose, the nurse was going to apply that pulses of hers his head, back spindly arm, I wonder to how she would cope with the locusts who would devour the mashed potato as quickly as she could apply it. Fast last year lost in thoughts of potatoes, ghouls and crocus's. I failed to notice that a man had approached me orbit silently. Good day to you, Sir, he said, clearing accumulated phlegm from his throat as he did so. Would I be correct in thinking you know something of the horrible cave? I looked up astonished and saw that my interlocutor was none other than the so called limping irredentist, Florencio popsters, along with Blenkinsop and degroote. Perhaps this was the man who brought rigor to the study of animals bones back in the 50s. I wondered what he was doing wandering disk constantly around the garden of a bewilderment home. For that is where I assumed I had been plunked. Before I had a chance to ask him, he began to drop questions at me about the horrible cave. After 15 or so queries, all of which I answered as best I could. Perhaps this changed tack and asked me why I was dressed as a giant bee. For my part, let me say it had not escaped my notice that the world famous irredentist was clad in Raymond of the utmost gorgeousness.

Frank Key  18:09
We seemed to have struck an instant rapport. So we strolled off together towards a nearby pie shop, which perhaps has informed me he had eaten that every single day for the last 30 years. When we entered the place, I pondered His judgment for the floor was alive with scurrying beetles, huge black terrible things, and the air was thick with the smell of hamster, seeing me about to swoon, perhaps does grinned, and I saw that his mouth was packed with fangs. There seem to be far too many of them to fit, but my eyes did not deceive me. You have an alarming number of teeth. Perhaps this guy observed. No more than any other member of my extended family, he replied, tapping a bell upon the counter, to summon the pie shop person. I have had a long and full life, but never before that I heard so dreadful the sound of that bell. I clap my hands over my ears and began to weep. Like a distressed orphan child. Perhaps this saw my discomfort and bared his fangs at me again. The hideous Beelzebub esque Bell peelings faded, but only once the sound had died completely did the proprietor appear. I had expected some sort of jolly finger like Mr. Doe, the baker, from a deck of happy families playing cards, but the pie shop person looked and acted more like a flop of the Regency period. He even wore gloves, scented with lavender, with a rakish twinkle in his eye. He greeted us and somehow made the words good often noon. Would you like to buy some pies sound lascivious? Yes, we would shouted perhaps this at top volume. For myself, I want to buy one of your big crinkle pastry dumpling and n dive and chicory pies, and two small mustard balls. My colleague here will have and he trailed off, leaving me to complete our request. Not having been to this pie shop before, I had no idea what I should choose, and there seemed to be no menu visible. But I sensed inexplicable danger and wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. I'll have the same I announced weekly. That won't be possible, I'm afraid, said the pie flop. As you must surely know, today is sent Eustace is day I did not have the energy to argue. Perhaps that blow on the head which family slumped in an unfamiliar armchair and suffering from amnesia had taken more of a toll than I thought. I pointed to two celery pies on a shelf behind the counter and asked for them. The proprietor print is locked with Microsoft oil and said those pies have a rental only. Beatles when are climbing up the legs of my borrowed be like boilersuit I could stand no more of this. I turned and left the pie shop slamming the door behind me. I decided that I would rather go hungry than allow myself to fall on the Pepsi spell. It was a tissue It was a decision I would learn to regret.

Frank Key  22:11
The horrible cave continued. Assuming the limping irredentist would pursue me as soon as he had got his hands on his pies. I flung myself into a ditch and covered myself with a flag that happened to be lying about. I was surprised that the flag had been abandoned, for it looked as if it had been stitched only recently, and there was still a needle attached to a dangling piece of thread. I accidentally prodded myself with the needle in the general area of my right collarbone, and had to stifle a Yelp in case Perhaps this was already on my trail. crouched under a flag in a ditch in the early afternoon. I turned my thoughts once more to the horrible cave, and to the crows that had nested there in. It was a long, long time since I had been perturbed by birds so long that I had difficulty remembering much about the days when my parents toffee shop had been attacked by flocks of mutant sparrows and wagtails. But the malevolence of the crows I had seen near the horrible cave was unprecedented. Tippi Hedren had an easy time of it. By comparison, I reflected ruefully, for I'm given to rueful reflection, especially when I can feel savage seeping into my boots as I could now, could I risk standing up? I knew that if I maintained my crowd for much longer, I would suffer from agonizing cramps, and I had left my cramp medication in the breast pocket of my pajama jacket back at the nursing home, or whatever it was. I wonder if I could flee from the diction make it to the building without being waylaid by pastors. All of a sudden, that stuffy lounge with its creaking armchair and Primrose, the nurse with her mashed potatoes. Even the right thing ghoul seemed more attractive than this stinking dick. crawling out from under the flag appeared over the lip of the ditch to check that perhaps this was no longer in the vicinity. He was not. Perhaps he had taken his pies and was sitting on a park bench masticating them with those fangs of his swallowing every last crumb. I clambered up and was about to stalk off towards the Mercy Home when I thought the flag might come in handy. So I stooped to pick it out of the deck. It was heavier than I thought, but eventually, I had it wrapped around me. As I turned to go, I saw that now my way was blocked by thousands of cows, all of them gazing at me intently. As if I was something they might want to chew up and digest while they cows, or were they super intelligent beings from a planet in a distant galaxy who looked like Earth cows. within the next few minutes, I would learn the truth, a truth far more incredible than my puny brain could comprehend. I stared at the cows and the cows stared back, like showed no sign of letting me pass. And then it dawned on me that they must have been sent as emissaries to stop me returning to the prog rock bewilderment home where Primrose tended to ghouls. The cows were trying to save me from becoming a duel myself, and urging me in their quiet cow like way to turn around, and to return in the direction of the horrible cave.

Frank Key  25:55
I span around and prompt stuff with renewed vigor in my step, and a sense that I had a mission to fulfill someone or something must have sent those cows and whoever or whatever it was emboldened me now. Soon I reached the blasted Heath, and I unwrapped myself from the flag and fashioned it into a sale. And, as if on cue, howling wind was dealing in my ears, and the wind caught my impromptu sale, and I was blown across that hideous Heath. In a matter of seconds. I laughed as I thought of the robbers and sprites that haunted the heath, lying in wait for innocent travelers, and how astonished they must have been. As I sped past them, I think humans speed I was back in the village before the shop shut up for the afternoon. class, I was able to exchange my B suit for more suitable garb and the tailors while I waited for the pins to be removed one by one from my newly boiled shirt. I quizzed the tailor about the events of the past few weeks since the terrors of Sunday, Eustace is day, he was forthright with replies to my gathered questions, explaining in vast but pointless detail. The crab attacks had been a prelude, a prelude to what I demanded. He removed the final pin from my new Boyle shirt and handed it to me. And as he did so, I saw that his face was suddenly stricken with terror. He was staring at something behind my left shoulder. I turned and came face to face with Christopher Plummer gone when the appurtenances of the secret agent he had pretended to be. Now he stood in the full splendor of his alien weirdness with several extra eyes gleaming on the ends of stalks, I realized with sudden clarity, the world shaking import of the messages the thousand cows had been sent to give me. Not only must I return to the horrible cave, but I had to take Christopher Plummer with me, and somehow stop him ever getting out again. I put on my boiled shirt.

Frank Key  28:31
That's the end of this week's show. Next week, we'll have the end of the exciting story of the horrible cave. I think I might go on I don't I can't remember how long it goes on for but it got a bit more. And thanks to pansy cradled q for reading the earlier piece. Thanks to john for producing the show. And that's all for this week. Bye bye.
