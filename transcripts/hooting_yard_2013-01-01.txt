Very good indeed that's the first outing for the furious it's coming out as such I think it's just a demo recording but sounding mighty fine indeed I want my life back in case you didn't guess that do furious and like I said playing on the seventh of February at the water rats. If you're interested in going whether you hear this live the show live or just any time online before before that show, then drop me an email and I could be able to get you in front out. That's all in St. Paul at art rocker magazine.com a little offer from the fury warriors there and find indeed, where am I going now? Yes, Pete found out Pete did some research or for us. The red gallery where the worms are playing Rivington Street. That's a shortage, isn't it? I'm sure it is Rivington street is where the red gallery is where that gigs gonna be with Sonic Boom DJing and all sorts of psychedelic evenings going on there. That would be good. And be it of wolves back in London. On the 20th of March. Would you look forward to seems like a long way to wait for the moment but back at the Macbeth. So that's one to look forward to, as well. Write a little bit more and then we'll do if you like a phone competition to win tickets for any one of the art rocker gigs at Hoxton square this week because they're on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and we'll do a little Foner Leanna is waiting upstairs to receive your phone call. We will run that shortly. But what am I going to play? Yes. The sirens there know very little about the sirens except that they got in touch with me last week. Because they thought I might like what they were doing and they've got a single out called Just be cool. And I certainly do like it.

Unknown Speaker  06:52
sirens and just be cooler and rocking single, I think it's a it's either single or it's just available on line. Right I'm gonna play another tune and then we'll do this kind of art rocker gig tickets give away. Before I play, play the next one for you. Just a couple of things I noticed on one day last week show you what an odd day it was a real mixed bag of observations. One was just, I guess, a political thought I don't often have political thoughts. And in fact, I have to expose this one as well. But I was listening to David Cameron. And one of his many cents for things that he was he was talking about it was last week, wasn't it that they were talking about the Falkland Islands, because they get shows how quick that slips in and out of the news doesn't he got to take an advert out in the news for it to last

Unknown Speaker  07:39
please today,

Unknown Speaker  07:40
or something like that. But he was certain about the the Falkland islanders wanted to remain British. And while they were if they wanted to vote, if they voted, then they would remain British. And I thought that was extraordinary thing to say that, that you actually had a choice on what nationality you were. You were so I I pondered the idea that in London, if you lived on the Isle of Dogs, for example. Then if you wanted to, you could get you could round up your mates on the Isle of Dogs and vote to join another country. And in fact, the old dogs could become part of France or something like that. It's rather interesting that that he felt that a place could vote to be to be somewhere else. If you want to vote to be part of Argentina, just go ahead and vote it. And maybe your wish can come true. On the same day in my local shop. Slightly different edge this one. I noticed that lint had brought out a 99% cocoa bar of chocolate 99% has anyone else done that? Has anyone else reached those heady heights? And who's gonna go for the magic 100 that's what I'm wondering. Is anyone out there? Tried 99%? Actually, I've got a friend Paul, who's so crazy. he would he would actually try it next time I see him I'm gonna ask him. It must be honestly I'm a I don't know how you eat your chocolate. But I'm a sucker. Not a chewer or biter. Okay, I'm a sucker and I just got a feeling that if you had a piece of 99% in your mouth before you went say to work in the morning, it would still be in your mouth by lunchtime. I'll actually be like eating a piece of coal with net 99% if anyone out there has tried this 19 I wouldn't know what it's like I haven't had the nerve yet to buy. Maybe tonight. I can't believe it's going to be popular. Popular pop in there. See if they've still got their 99 percenters anyway. Good old lintz they'll try anything. I think it's magnificent. Right? I digress. bombers, and drawing new single by bombers who like a lot and I'd quite like to see live actually and then we'll give away the rocket tickets.

Unknown Speaker  11:55
Excellent that's bomas and a new single I do believe unless it's Yeah. Where it doesn't really matter how it comes out, does it say in some shape or form? Even if it's a download, I'm getting addicted. Right? That's, that's true. I've got too much music around here and I've got that that's no, it's all it's all a bit of a mess all gone a bit haywire here. But don't you worry about it something, something will come through in the end, actually, I'm getting. I'm getting a bit. The chocolate issue is raised. Thanks, Pete for researching that or looking into and certainly I have tried 80% as well. And that's why I'm tempted to think that 99 is, is truly would be truly hard work. Because I've tried 80% and that's the one that took me about half an hour to get through one piece. And as Pete raises certainly, cooking chocolate is often high cocoa percentage. You eat cooking chocolates about 80% you reckon? What is the difference between cooking chocolate, and normally, apart from the percentage of cocoa content?

Unknown Speaker  13:04
Why is it so much cheaper? And why doesn't Why doesn't everyone buy it all the time?

Unknown Speaker  13:10
Because it's about half the price, isn't it? But But no, I just not have seen I have not I don't think I've seen higher than maybe I've seen a 90% but 99% Okay, I'm gonna get it, perhaps even eat it live on air next week. That would be a new feature. Okay, foods challenges. I can feel a whole new range of it could use up the wildlife impersonation. In fact, probably the two don't go together very well, actually. But maybe I'll try the 1900 nine to 9% online, right quickly Foner because we're running out of time. The shows this week are at the Hoxton square bar and kitchen they are art rocker new blood to gigs tomorrow night Wales in cubicles fractures. I'm on the wrong weekend so that was last week. Okay. Tomorrow night reptile youth neurotic mass movement blackeye and entertainment I don't know there's bands I must admit but chosen through the art rocker new blood expose a features.

I'm going to play a token of last week. We've been playing a lot of Bristol see seeing catching up with what's going on down there through the howling owl records releases. And I'm going to play something by Let's kill Janice. Now because I've been enjoying what I've been hearing by them. This is a track called Parker. And I'm kind of assuming you haven't studied the Luke's I'm assuming it's an ode to the man from Thunderbirds.

Unknown Speaker  18:09
Excellent. Let's kill Janice and Parker. I think that's from an EP of some sort on the howling owl label and it's good now to have given some reasonable justice to the Bristol scene especially courtesy of the howling owl I will continue to look at other things that might be going to play golf balls haven't played you yet and more from towns maybe because they're a fine band. hopefully there'll be something new by then. I know from Leon yet, like I said, if you want to go to any of those art rocker shows at Hoxton square bar and kitchen this week, then give us a call now and you will get a free ticket that's all you got to do call Oh 2074071 to one Oh, give your name phone number to Leanne upstairs now and we can get you into any of those shows this week. Help sort that out, doesn't it? Just one more I'm going to squeeze another track and then do the gig guide but before I do another example of things going on that that I would you know include in our keep guide or like to hear about events going on. You know, I like a bit of art every now again now we trekked along me and Miss sweet went to the ICA yesterday to catch the last day of the Bloomberg New contemporaries which is basically I think it's third time they've had it and it's a show for new emerging art straight out of UK art colleges. To be honest, we found the art doll a bit boring. A couple of things one film in particular, which I thought was quite interesting upstairs but to be honest. I mean, how dreadful must that be? Boring art. You know, it's not even. I wouldn't even say it was bad. It was just a bit a bit boring. But what I did think was worth mentioning because it goes on for another week. So you've got one more week to go and have a Which I found quite interesting was an exhibition in the room where they normally have the live stuff at the ICA. And it is about the fourth plinth at Trafalgar Square. And it goes on to the 20th. January, says here since 1999, the empty Northwest plinth in Trafalgar Square, has been home to some of the world's best contemporary art. This exhibition brings together a wide range of historical material, including a display of commissioned maquettes, in other words, models of the stuff that has gone up. And I think as well one, it reminds you of some of the things that you've seen in Trafalgar Square, but also some of the things that didn't actually make it. There's also a section in there of the press reaction to some which is of course very wonderful. The Press reaction to to modern art and stuff like that is always completely over the top, but it was most enjoyable artists include, I mean, all sorts, Chris burden sucuri Douglas camp Jeremy della Tracy, MN, Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor, Sarah Lucas, Mark Quinn Thomas shirt, Yinka Shonibare, Bob and Roberta Smith. Mark Ballinger, were actually what I mean some top notch stuff in there and it's quite a clever way of seeing art. It's like miniatures. most enjoyable and does remind you about the good use they've put it to really write the softpaq are in town next week. Thursday 24th of January they're playing at cargo. Their last album got a right old slating everywhere I saw it, nobody liked it. I think I found a track I quite enjoyed off the album The album was called strap This is Chinatown by the soft pack.

Unknown Speaker  24:27
Yeah, still sounded good to me. You know I remember seeing I think on a on a boat on the Thames a few years ago and they were most enjoyable previous album was a Corker. This one didn't have quite as many assets was strapped, I think the album out last year, but yeah, I might. That might be something that I might try and sort out some tickets for to do as a competition prize next week. softpaq in town, right. Let's run through running shorter time now. So let's run through what we've got. On the gig guide, like I said, Nothing is shown up for tonight. So you're welcome to battle your way home in the cold weather. Stay indoors, get yourself some hot whiskey and put your feet up catch up on one bargain or something that you're enjoying on the I player. They asked my advice tomorrow night death rays of idea who we have played on this show. And if I'd had time I might have Splatoon they are playing for free at the old blue last Wednesday night now a band that I haven't played on this show, but I think I've quite enjoyed actually when I've heard on the likes of six music Dutch uncle's playing at Rough Trade East tomorrow, not tomorrow night Wednesday night for free, so that will be at about seven o'clock. So always worth catching for free. Down there Dutch uncle's at Rough Trade east on Wednesday, virals who of course the band formed out of the ashes of lovers. They're playing at birthdays on Wednesday. Thursday night. There's a pop noir night that is the label set up by savages. Of course or rather john and Jen. Really their first band, kind of synth pop band called les cop from France are playing at birthdays with support from Tegan from boning gun, who does a kind of experimental noise kind of set on his own. Also on Thursday that art rocker gig Brut chorus and Velcro hooks Hoxton, square bar and kitchen Friday this week, the pheromones are playing a guided missile night at the buffalo bar. There's a garriage rock night run by the deviation street people that featuring Len price the lead price three that's at the alleycat on Friday. The death pedals are doing their hardcore thing at the urban bar on Friday. You know what couldn't find anything for Saturday or Sunday. So this weekend you have to go to another city or something like that to know Monday looking ahead now free show at the Lexington by the computers. It's kind of a comeback gig. I think and I think there's some new computers music out there. And I've got to find it Tuesday looking ahead bloodroot chooser at Shepherds Bush Empire clutch here at cocoa and what I'm going to play for you next week, a Belgian noise rock band I don't know how to say this a min raw I mean raw very poor I don't know There must be a way of pronouncing that are at the garriage I'm gonna play some of that next week. And that's intense stuff indeed. Looking at soft pack next week shields next week at the garriage and a new heavy sounds night may or may not be going on more news of that next week and also shiny darkly in town soon enough, right I'm gonna leave you with something from New Zealand's Muse I records now. I'm Wilberforce is urbandoor coming over here from New Zealand in May. I'm going to help him out as much as I possibly can. I'm going to play you something by them. But they turned me on to this new started two years ago a new indie label in New Zealand called Muse I records next week I'm going to dip into some of their other stuff but for the moment and say goodbye his Wilbur forces and magdelena brothers
