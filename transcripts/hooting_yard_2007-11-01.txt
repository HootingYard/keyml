Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key, and this is hooting out on the air. Recently, the recent Polish elections are won by the Civic Platform Party, led by Donald Tusk struck me that Donald Tusk sounds less like the Polish Prime Minister than some kind of plutocrat, you know, modern American novel. Anyway, the point is that the Civic Platform won, he won the election and forming a government with the peasants party. And they reminded me that for a long time now, there's been talk of creating a hooting yards Civic Platform. Unfortunately, the discussions have been mired in disagreement. unintelligibility hysteria and pomposity, but perhaps it's time to let bygones be bygones and crack on with the job. any future hooting yd Civic Platform will be robust rather than weedy and it will be fit for purpose. Those are really the only things we need to bear in mind, for all else is as a vapor of haze in a mist of Unknowing, as Mrs. gubbins put it the other day, while talking in her sleep. It's difficult to overstate the importance of Mrs. gubbins contribution to this project. The Crone is nearly 19 now and has very few teeth in her head. But she's been around long enough to see an impressive number of platforms, both civic and otherwise, come and go. Our platform when it is built will rest on solid foundations. And we must thank her for that. Even if she is likely to be taking an afternoon nap when we do so. I had hoped to bring on board a squadron of zonke i'd Miliband to kick start this new energetic phase of Civic Platform development. But Mrs. gubbins head turned green and septic when this idea was mooted, so I abandoned it. Instead, I got a pot of paint and daubed, not weedy, robust on a makeshift prototype platform donated by old farmer frac. Apparently it's made out of bits of a cow buyer that he smashed up one night, but it serves its purpose admirably and looks very civic plopped in the middle of a field rife with Bracken Mrs. gubbins whose head is thankfully back to normal, has planted some nettles they're about to add what she calls a dash of spout and rigor to the scene. Whether the Spartans made use of nettles in such a way is not something I know about, and nor I suspect does lag gubbins, but it's always best to humor her fancies. attractive as the Prato platform is it lacks a certain coherence, for it remains unclear what kind of initiatives and policies will be launched from it. And believe you me I intend the hooting yard Civic Platform to be a launchpad for a bewildering number of initiatives and policies. That's why I particularly damp and gloomy cellar in Pang Hill orphanage will be the headquarters soon I hope of the Pang Hill orphanage Think Tank from which ideas will phase it would already have been set up had I been able to bash into old farmer fracks head the notion that as a mad bellowing rustic, he's not really a suitable candidate to be the think tanks director. He has his heart set on the position bless him, even though it doesn't involve cows, but I'm hoping to fob him off by making him an honorary patron. Which brings me neatly to the main point of this other otherwise witless drivel, which is that you too can apply to sit alongside old farmer frac at the snack bar counter reserved for honorary patrons of the hooting yards Civic Platform to be considered for this unbearably thrilling way of spending your twilight years. All you need to do is to complete the following sentence in no more than 10,000 words. I will prove to be a robust rather than we the patron of the hooting yards Civic Platform, because my first priority will be and you go on from there and send your entries to to me at hooting. dot yard@gmail.com And Mrs gubbins will be sorting through all the entries over the next couple of weeks in between naps and nettle husbandry. One application already received is from fitzmorris trenary.

And he wrote as follows. I will prove to be a robust rather than we the patron of the hooting yd Civic Platform, because my first priority will be to bring in a raft of measures, or perhaps a tranche, I haven't decided, it will certainly be a collective noun of that you can be sure, I will certainly have more than one measure. Come to think of it. I'll probably have more than two. I can't just say I will bring in a couple of measures. It sounds weedy. A few measures at least probably not several. I think definitely a tranche because being a French word meanings slice. It reminds me of holiday spent in my grandfather's pigeon tower or pg&e, a in Breton, gazing out through the bars that the rest of the family enjoying slices of cake in the rock garden. Besides, if I were to say my first priority would be to introduce a slice of measures, people would laugh and snort and scarf and deride and backbite and Heckle and sneer and taunt and mock raft. Moreover, as a collective noun I've never understood. The phrase a raft of measures puts me in mind of a watercraft made entirely of hastily lashed together spirit levels, which because of a fair structural fragility, and be their intended purpose of precisely measuring can't or gradient would be doubly useless on the high seas.

I keep forgetting to mention, so luckily, this week, I'm remembering that next week on Friday, Friday, the ninth of November, drop everything you're doing and go to slow. Eight o'clock in the West Wing center in Sao there will be an evening of lagu breus music and lopsided prose. The lagu breeze music is provided by David outer Spaceman and the lagu Bria and their lopsided Pros will be read by me various items from the routing yard archive. You can get details from the following address http colon double slash fener f a double n e r dot d dict.co.uk is the manifest named after Fenner Brockway will be the third time I've appeared there. In slam the only time I ever go too slow. That's next week, Friday the ninth of November I think at about 8pm but go to the website and check. And yeah, come along. This is called tiny Enid and the gormless nipper club footed top winds heroism cup. This was the headline on the front page of the daily brouhaha that first brought tiny Enid to national attention. Until then, her heroic exploits were known only to a few. Her intervention in the case of the gormless Nipa changed all that, at least for a while until a fad or frippery came along to divert the fickle public. Yet some of us have not forgotten the heroic infant, and it's important that a new generation be reminded of her deeds. The gormless nipper was roughly the same age as tiny Enid and have roughly the same diminutive stature, but otherwise the pair of the might have inhabited different planets were tiny Enid was heroic. The Nipa was gormless were tiny. Enid showed valla gusto and dash the nipper was gormless gormless gormless? The nipper was raised in an orphanage, not unlike Pang Hill orphanage. It was a monstrous black brick building crumbling upon a hillside. One winter's day, the gormless nipper was leaning out of a window gazing gormlessly at the sky when he fell, landing in a gormless heap in the snow. Instead of trudging back through the snow to the huge iron door of the orphanage and wrapping his tire feast upon it until the kindly matron let him back in. The gormless Nipa wandered off, away from his grim black brick home ever further away until he was quite lost. Thus began a series of accidents and misadventures, which befell him due to his groundlessness. stopping to rest at a level crossing, his cravat was singed by sparks from a passing locomotive. When he made to untie the corvatsch. To look more closely at this engine, he half strangled himself and lost consciousness. swooning, he fell forward so that the very top of his head almost touched the railway track. And when a second locomotive thundered past seconds later, he received an inadvertent haircut, his locks torn out by the screeching metal train wheels. Had he had a mirror when he awoke from his swoon that gormless nipper would have seen that he now had the appearance of a tonsured fryer. He roamed onwards, crossing the tracks and fell into a pond. miniscule aquatic beings within the pond attached themselves to his skin, and burrowed through to his innards, where they fed upon his tissue and squirted out pond venom. They were microscopic beings actual size, so the gormless nipper was aware of their parasitic sucking and squirting, and the amounts of pond venom was so infinitesimally small that even the most advanced scientific operators would be unable to detect them. Nevertheless, he began to feel off color, and when eventually the venom reached his brain, it had the effect of increasing rather than alleviating his gormless pneus.

The Nipa slept that night in a buyer surrounded by cows, discovered at dawn by a florid faced farmer, he was set to work pulling a plow through a field. The winter sun blazed on his TomSka and turn the snow to slush. And by the time he was done plowing the nipples socks was soaking wet. He took them off and hung them up to dry on what he thought was a washing line. Alas, it was an electricity cable running from the farmer's generator to a new fangled power spade, and the gormless nipper was jolted by a shock of sufficient voltage to make him queasy. So when shortly afterwards, the farmer fed him a bowl of soup, he vomited it up all over the freshly laundered farm yard kitchen table cloth, an heirloom embroidered with unbelievable delicacy by the farmers great great grandmother. Understandably furious, the farmer kick the gormless nipper all the way down the lane into the village square at screwin hoon Puj and abandoned him they're dazed and saw still queasy. And with the pond, venom coursing through his vitals. The gormless nipples slumped against a plinth. The village beetle found him there. Tom children sockless and with sick on his sleeves, and accused him of defiling the statue of frizzy haired minstrel Leo Sayer atop the plinth, which was the pride of the village thrown into a dungeon. The slip the nipper slept fitfully that night in the company of mice and beetles. The next morning, the beetle handed the gormless nipper over to a brute to whom he would we be apprenticed for the next six months. day in day out, the brute sent the nipper to the bottom of the sea in his bath escape from where he had to plunge into deep sea trenches and collect eerie bioluminescent organisms. The goggles of his diving suit did not fit snugly, and the gormless snippet gradually began to lose his sight. When he was almost blind. The Brook rode him out to sea and left him marooned on a welkin crusted rock and their turn, excuse me, and there he may have perished were it not for tiny Enid one day, eager to do a heroic deed. She sailed aloft in her hot air balloon and spotted the gormless nipper weekly trying to prize the very last welke from the rock. Rightly judging that he was far too puny and famished to hoist himself up any rope tree might dangle down to him. Tiny Enid set her burners roaring and ascended high enough to snare accumulate, tying a quickly scribbled message to the birds leg. She propelled it in the direction of the air Sea Rescue station at some bibley bid. Deb then descended again until she was in shouting distance of the gormless nipper. Fear not nipper she cried. I am tiny Enid I have alerted the air Sea Rescue station at St. bibley. Babe to your sorry plight by attaching a message to the leg of accumulate. The bird is flying its little heart out, even as we speak, and soon a lovely big lifeboat will scatter across the waves to rescue you. preserve your energy and stop trying to prize that last welke from the rock. For soon you will be sitting at my kitchen table wolfing down a slap up hot dinner of non seafood items. And so it was that nine months to the day since he had fallen from the orphanage window into the snow. The gormless nipper returned to his grim black brick home. He was driven there by tiny Enid herself in a hot shower bank on the day after she was awarded a tin cup for heroism. The gormless nipper had managed not to be sick all over tiny in its tablecloth, and a few eyedrops from her mysterious cabinet had restored his sight. The hair had grown back where it had been ripped out by the locomotive, and his heroic rescuer selflessly gave him a pair of her own socks to replace the ones still hanging neglected from the farmers electricity cable had tiny Enid known that the nepo was riddled with microscopic aquatic parasites, squirting pond venom, no doubt she would have found a way of exterminating them. She was that kind of girl.

More about Mrs. gubbins now who's been very active recently. Among the most inventive minds at work today are our management consultants, those busy brained men and women forever thinking up exciting new ideas for the world of work. We're all I hope familiar by now with hot desking a revolutionary approach which allows a business to sell off half of its office furniture for the greater good. Now I've learned somewhat belatedly, I've met that the BBC has launched a hot shoes initiative. First, the furniture now the clothes, what will be the next hot thing? Here at hooting yard we always try to keep one step ahead of the latest management thinking. So we tasked Mrs gubbins to come up with a list of hot thing initiatives. Being an octogenarian Crone, like our bins balked at the use of tasked as a verb, but we fed her a bowl of gravy pudding and offered to help find that knitting needle she mislaid, and she soon came on board. She initially decided, she initially decided to set up a working party to originate and assess various hot ideas, but this was felt to be crass, until it dropped the Working Party title and renamed itself as an ideas silo. The silo has a hub with Rei bi, each radius has a directional pointing device, and at the end point of each has a brain crate. responsibility for sifting through the crates rests with Mrs. gubbins herself in between her core activities of knitting tea cozies and taking naps as a result of her first such sift, hooting yard will shortly be launching a series of hot initiatives entitled hot pencil sharpeners, hot carpets, hot puddings, and hot pizza winguard monogrammed cravats I think listeners will be able to appreciate the tremendous benefits these hot things will have on the ongoing hooting yard world domination project and remember, you're important to us. Please let us know what we can do to make further 360 degree improvements, whatever they may be.

Ask any halfway sane person where they go to find out the latest information on pays. And chances are they'll say hooting Of course, I think we have a proud record of bringing p news to the masses. And in keeping with that, I received a communique from roving hooting yard reporter Tristan shatavari dear Frank, this is an important fact that you may wish to file somewhere in your pulsating cranium. According to Wikipedia, his article about The Aviator and recluse Howard Hughes quote, in the 1930s close friends reported he was obsessed with the size of peas. And there was an earlier p related dispatch on voting yard, and I thought I'd remind you of that here. There are small green solid edible spheres and you eat them from pods. I'm talking about peas Of course. Let's sing their praises. at the dinner tables of hooting yard, there's a food we hold in high regard. Oh, I wonder what can it be? It's the little green edible sphere called the P. The shelling of peas has long been recognized as a therapeutic activity on a par with pig observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend that neurasthenic patients should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another hour leaning over the fence of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist toppin Paltrow suggested doing both at the same time, with results that have been hotly debated ever since. It was Paltrow student PK Spaceman, who coined the term p q. For p quality and your P Q is easily calculated. Take the number of peas you have eaten in your lifetime and divided by your age. This figure can be plotted on a grid against for example, your body mass index rotunda T of head shoe size and various phenological data. Dr. Spaceman was fond of citing Lloyd George's view that Neville Chamberlain had a wrong shaped head and put this down to a lack of peas in the latter's diet. Sometimes he attributed to a lack of peas in the former's diet to in desperate circumstances. For example, when one's life is at risk, peas can become useful tools or at least add drunks to tools. There is the story of the Antarctic Explorer, clinging by his frostbitten fingertips to the edge of a crevasse down which he was about to plunge, who managed to clamber up onto the ice by fashioning a harness using ribbons, elastic bands and frozen peas. Peas have been compared with planets sometimes by poet. The author of the song we heard at the beginning of this piece, wrote other p related verses, in one of which he takes each planet in turn, using the mnemonic mad vinegar Ecto plasm more hands Jasper's three albums the unspeakable mix and poppin J. And contemplates them as peas in a pod, not yet shelled by one of Dr. Space man's wild eyed brain sick patients. There is no mention of pigs in the poem. Make that what you will.

Apart from the evening of lugubrious music and lopsided prose, barring cancellations or hissy fits Next week, we'll also see the first of hooting yards news Public seminars were matters of great import will be debated by a mix of expert intellectuals, charlatans, rascals and persons of fecklessness. The topic of our first debate is life beyond death, and will be an exciting head to head pitting the enormously wealthy best selling author Deepak Chopra against hooting yards very own little severing of a mystic badger. Mr. Chopra will argue that he has spiritual insights into life after death. Based on his rigorous and expert understanding of quantum physics. Little Severin the mystic badger will scrub all about in the undergrowth and snuffle the air in his mystic way, thus proving a very worthy opponent claims that the debate is weighted too heavily and Deepak Chopra's favor can be summarily disposed of little Severin the mystic badger knows just as much about quantum physics as his human opponent, if not more so. And so suggest that the Badger will be out with it is plain wrong. You'll see the debates will take place in a tent in the middle of a field near sawdust bridge tickets to see little sever in a free but unfortunately, you'll have to pay through the nose to see Deepak Chopra segment. For so higher spiritual plane has he reached through use of transcendental meditation and other techniques that it takes an enormous cash flow to keep him bobbing up there in the mystic ether. In addition to our wallet packed with cash, please bring some grubs and roots to donate to little severance cupboard. And that's nearly the end of hooting yard for this week. But I just like to leave you with with this. floatiness The philosopher of ancient Greece who gave us the six na ad, had atrocious handwriting did not properly separate individual words, and did not bother himself with the niceties of spelling. His student porphyry who edited polished and arranged the any ads for publication have the thankless preliminary task of transcribing floatiness to shoddy and near illegible scribbles. That was almost 2000 years ago. Yet in many ways it describes perfectly the working relationship that obtained between Dobson and marigold to the out of print pamphleteer had an abysmal scrawl, possibly because of the unusual way he clutched his pencil like a monkey with a pin cushion. It may be difficult to make sense of that simile, but go and lie down in a darkened room and screw your eyes tightly shot and everything will become clear for salvaging any clarity at all from Dobson's notebooks, we have marigold Choo to thank, without her, not one of those majestic pamphlets would ever have been tucked lovingly onto the shelves of a motorway service station or airport bookstore among much that they have in common porphyry and marigolds to excellent proofreaders capable of spotting the tiniest error and correcting it. This is not a job you would give to the American cinema actor Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis is apparently a keen contributor to blogs and chat rooms online. And when other readers pointed out his many infelicities of grammar and spelling, he issued the immortal retort. proofreading is for pussies. He will not be considered for a work experience placement hooting yard.

So that's all for this week. Hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
