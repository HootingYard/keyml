Good evening, this is hosting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. It's a live show. So I think I should point out to listeners that in an extremely grumpy mood today and it's, I suppose a measure of the self sacrifice that I'm going to spend the next half hour trying to sound perky and cheerful as I read to you, rather than going into some kind of a rant. Anyway, this is called absence of swarms. They were barrage balloons in the sky On the morning when I decided to mesmerize a swarm. I had been thinking of doing so for some time for months. In fact, the idea of having so savage or bird as a swarm within my power in Thrall me. Gerard Manley Hopkins famously mesmerized a duck on the 27th of April 1871. But I was going to go one better, and in trance a large white swan. I filled my pockets with pebbles and pranced towards the pond, where I fully expected to find a few swans swanning about one of which I would choose as my mesmeric subjects one. I looked up at the barrage balloons, wondering why there were so many of them in huddles just below cloud level, was that the correct attitude for barrage balloons, I knew not. I had neglected that morning to wash my hair and I'm afraid to say that it was disgusting the greasy as a consequence. And a further consequence was that as I made my way towards the pond, I was jeered at by a little tangle of hoodies who used the grittiness of my hair as a pretext to abuse me. I suspect that had I washed my hair, they would have lit upon some other feature, my carriage or my garments, or the scars on my face where I had been bitten by birds. Now, I've always found that the most effective way to deal with hoodies and similar riffraff is to visit upon them sudden, ferocious and inexplicable violence. So packed with pebbles were my pockets, that I had no room that morning for hand grenades or pepper sprays or petrol soap rags, so my usual avenues of hoodie terrorizing were closed. Instead, I ran at them whirling my arms and screeching as loud as I said, You've bitterns. The bittern is one of the noisiest birds in the avian panoply, and it's loud, booming call is one of the fathers traveling of all birdsongs. The male calls relentlessly both day and night from deep within his reedbed hoping to attract a female into his territory. My purpose of course, was to repel rather than to attract, and in this I was successful. The hoodies fled for me, as I expect you would have done for when I'm frightening, I am very frightening. composing myself, I've turned back to the path and continued towards the pond. It was a fine pond as ponds go the shape of a frying pan when viewed from above, as I had viewed it many times, from hot air balloons and aerostats. It's many years now since I've been aloft, my physician identified a peculiar substance in my head which throbbed and became inflamed if I traveled much above sea level. So I took her advice, moved to a flat part of the country, and with some regret curtailed my aerial exploits. I fear that my close study of birds would be in jeopardy now I was forced for medical reasons to hunker close to the ground, but it soon became apparent that I still had numberless ornithological opportunities, given that many birds stick pretty close to the ground themselves, a lot of the time, swans among them. To my utmost dismay, upon arrival at the pond, I saw no swans at all. This was most unusual, but I rapidly connected the absence of swans to the sight of black and yellow police tape, real all the way around the pond, fastened to what I hoped were temporary, permanent Particular metal poles. Sometimes police tape is blue and white. And sometimes as on this occasion it is black and yellow. my idol fancy has always been that the latter colors are picked by a police be enthusiastic, but I'm sure there's a more sensible reason.

I certainly wanted to know the reason for the appearance of the tape on the very morning when I planned to mesmerize a swarm. And I looked around for a police officer who might could bombard with questions on the far side of the pond. I was delighted to see PC Nesbitt, who was known to me personally, we'd belong to the same branch of the beige cardigan and trousers club and often sat within shouting distance of each other at Club picnics. I shouted at him now using my bittern boom, vote in a friendlier way than I had deployed it against the hoodies. And I saw PC Nesbitt cover his ears in shock. My what large irregular is the man had, if he had been unfortunate enough to be born in an earlier and more brutish age, his ears would surely have been exhibited by a mountebank for money. I think he must have had a specially modified police helmet to accommodate them. But if so, it was a very clever modification, not apparent to a casual observer. I did not want to have to boom my catalog of questions across the pond. So I began walking around it towards the PC, and he too began walking in his policeman Lee way towards me. So we met our pathway, where there was a kiosk selling refreshments. I plumped for a tin of squirrelled Joe, and PC Ms. Bit who confessed to being packaged, bought a tub of boiled fish parts. We settled on a bench next to the kiosk, but before I can ask him about the police tape and the absence of swans, he remarked upon the disgusting grittiness of my hair, and I had to explain that it had gone on washed that morning, as I was pressed for time. Off the upbraiding me and giving a long winded alarm about the dangers of excess grease in the hair. It began babbling about the barrage balloons, which still loomed in the sky above us. I was impatient to change the subject, but piecing this bit was a fiendishly difficult man to interrupt. They never seem to need to pause for breath, the words tumbling out of his mouth, one after another, like bats from a cave. Somehow, he was managing to eat his boiled fish parts at the same time, which made his jabbering even harder to understand than usual. I began to despair and wonder if I could stop him by pretending to swoon so I dropped my squelch show and toppled off the bench into the market the pond edge. This had the desired effect. All of it meant that the grease in my hair was now mingled with mud beetles and slime. Why is police tape real around the pond and where are the swans are wrapped as I climbed back onto the bench. PC Nesbitt took a deep breath and re babbled. He told me that a terrible crime had been committed, and that shortly forensic officers in skin diving equipment would arrive to drag the pond. The swans have been removed to what he called a place of safety. I wanted to know where this was, so I could pursue my Swan mesmerize ation plan without further delay, but the PC claimed not to know. Before dawn, he said a squadron of bird management officers trained in Swan removal techniques had descended upon the pond and removed the swans using the techniques in which they had been trained. But whether swans had been removed to and if or when they would ever be returned to the pond. And if indeed the place of safety was truly safe for swans. These were matters it was thought best not to divulge to an ordinary copper. From his fantastic ears to his unstoppable jabbering. There was little it was ordinary about piecing this bit, but I took his point. If I were put in charge of upon crime and attendance one removal, I would not see the need to tell every last detail of the operation to a lowly functionary. But clearly, I needed to eat from PC Nesbitt, the name and whereabouts of the officer in charge of the case. After much more babbling, I learned that this was detective Captain kargh pan and that he was at that very moment back at The station roughing up a malefactor, IBM PC in his bid farewell and set off hot foot for the police station.

I was passed out when I got there, and when I slumped against the front desk was outraged to find myself placed under immediate arrest by the desk sergeant, a florid character with the eyes of a pig and the nose of a crow. I protested while I was a fine upstanding member of the local community, and a committee member of the beige cardigan and trousers club, but to no avail. Snack snapping a pair of manacles on me and shoving me into a cell. The florid Sergeant told me he was arresting me for entering a police station with grease and modern beetles and slime in my hair, and for probably having something to do with the appearance of untold numbers of barrage balloons in the sky that morning. My request to send a desperate heartfelt message to David Blunkett by a metal Tapping Machine was met with a punch on the side of my head. This dislodged at least one of the beagles for my hair as the cell door crank shot. What a predicament. I had got out of bed that morning with the innocent intention of mesmerizing a swarm, and now I found myself locked up in a grimy police cell, and quite possibly due to be bashed about by detective Captain card pan. I would have to admit the first charge of course, but how could I be able to prove that I had nothing to do the barrage balloons by fretted and fumed and then I remembered the pebbles packed in my pocket. so eager had the desk Sergeant been to bang me up that he had not bothered to search me and to confiscate my pebbles. I realized that if I deployed them in a very clever way, I would not only be able to avert a roughing up by cargo van, but I might very well managed to escape the police station entirely. There are thousands of very clever things one can do with pocket falls of pebbles. That's the title more or less of an invaluable but out of print pamphlet by Dobson, which I have read many times and have almost by heart. For example, my pebbles were in a central part of the mesmerizing of a swamp, which is one my pockets were packed with them. Now though, they would have to serve a different purpose. Having devised my very clever scheme, I did not waste a second and deployed the pebbles accordingly. 10 minutes later, I was scampering along the winding lane from the police station into the forest, a free man again. I made my way to the densest part of the woods, where the foliage was so thick that I could no longer see the sky. Nor as a result, could I see the barrage balloons, and this afforded me some relief. The looming presence of cast a pall over the morning I was famished and hankered for kippers. But I had to make do with berries and grubs. How long would I have to remain in hiding? I was sure that Kant pan would send a gaggle of blue bottles to flush me out. I had used all my pebbles in escaping from him, and the forest floor death was singularly lacking in further pebbles. I ate some more berries and grubs and racked my brains for a plan. But I could not stop thinking about kippers. I wished I'd bought a spare tin of squirrelled show. Back at the kiosk for I was thirsty as well as hungry. I sucked some moisture from a leaf. If only I had thought to bring my portable metal Tapping Machine, I could have sent a message to PC Nesbitt. That man had a heart almost as big as one of his massive is and in spite of his infuriating babbling, he was steadfast and reliable. I recalled that he had once told me of his dallying with telepathy, conducted after nightfall in his allotment shed. His sole success had been what he described as a rather unsatisfactory conversation with a weasel half savaged by an owl, but I wondered if he had made further progress since that breakthrough. furrowing my brow and appearing vaguely in the direction I thought Petey Nesbitt would be where he's still patrolling the pond. I aimed a message at him, imploring Him to come and rescue me from the forest to protect me from detective Captain card pans fist and to feed me with kippers.

I think Todd Davis passed before I was ready to admit to myself that the exercise was completely futile. At least I think it was a day I was not wearing a timepiece and I was interested crowded in the forest gloom, so I became unsure of the passage of time. By my possibly inaccurate reckoning, I've been here for three months now. Every so often I have to hide from one of kg pans, thuggish patrols. They pass through the forest, beating the trees with their truncheons and shouting my name. Once I was tempted to give myself up and to take what was coming to me, however unjust it was, but at the last moment, I rallied my burning sense of foolhardy valor, and hid myself deep in a brambly thicket. I am surviving remarkably well, on a diet of berries and grubs, and what moisture I can suck from leaves. Although my cravings for kippers and sculpture on demand, and I suffer greatly like a medieval saint. But I have a plan. I know that buried under the Duff on the forest floor, there must be pebbles somewhere. Every day now, I dig for hours with my hands, and at the last count, my stockpile has grown to six reasonably pebbly pebbles. It is only a matter of time before I have enough to pack my pockets full. And then I shall deploy them in a very clever way, and emerge from the forest, and I shall stride majestically home and wash my hair. And then I shall refill my pocket with a fresh supply of pebbles and marks where I shall find some swans, and I shall mesmerize one of them and have it in my power. It will be interesting to see if barrage balloons are still looming the sky just below the clouds or whether they have vanished away and left the sky clear and bright and expansive, implausible blue.

excitingly we had some slightly different theme music then. more often. This is called tosspot in a bivouac. Once upon a time, I was scrambling down the lower reaches of a mountainside through shingle and scumbling Bracken. When I chanced upon a tosspot bivouac. It was a surprisingly well made bivouac using branches from large into beach and bladder knots and sycamore trees to form a roof upon which sufficient foliage had been impacted. To provide Sterling shelter from hail storms and tempests. All other weather was in fact spectacularly Clement. Clement to was the name of the tosspot. As I soon learned, for I immediately struck up a conversation with him, as is my habit when I encounter mountainside people. I learned that he had taken his bivouac after fleeing, fleeing from what I asked, but he seemed reluctant to tell me someone with a less acute insight into human nature than I may have put this down to coyness. But I spent many years studying under gluggy and Dempster. So I knew there was more than simple China's behind his diffident mutterings, and I determined to Winkle the full story out of him. So I grabbed the top spot around the neck with one of my huge bear like hands, lifted him off his feet, and shook my other huge bear like hand made into a fist in front of his face, as Dempster taught by attuning one's fist shaking to a very precise rhythm, the half strangled subject is quickly placed in what Draggy termed a confessional brain zone. I came to having been injected with a truth serum. As I suggested, it took years of training to perfect the technique, and I'm afraid a large number of fully strangled hamsters and stoats like buried in the grounds of the Institute. Five minutes later, I was fully apprised of the reasons why the tosspot had fled to his mountainside bivouac. He had been employed as an extra in a heist film set on a submarine. Sterling Hayden may have been involved in the production, but this was not entirely clear. What came shining through the tosspot account, however, was the claustrophobic atmosphere on the set, which was actually a real decommissioned submarine. The tenebrous leaking interior had been slightly refurbished. To include heist movie essential was like an intricate security system and a safe full of gold bullion, but otherwise it remained cramped and hot and riddled with clanking machinery. After six days filming, during which time he had to lean against a damaged, pump looking mordant, but tosspot had cracked, tearing off his sub mariners green tunic and cap. He stumbled out of the submarine swam to the surface of the tank in which it was docked, scrambled up a ladder to the studio canteen, and fled until he reached the mountainside where with unaccustomed competence, he constructed his bivouac using already fallen branches from large and beach and gladness and sycamore trees and the foliage there of where I bumped into him as I scrambled down from the mountain peak, upon which I had been making an invaluable study of the nesting habits of the mountain lock wit. Later, I was to discover the continuity person on the film said, distraught at the vanishing of Clement to the tosspot and unable to find anyone have a similar physiognomy to lean against the damage pump looking more than advise the producer to abandon the project. It remained unclear whether this producer was Sterling Hayden, or possibly human Cronin. Either way, the film was never finished. I put down the tosspot and gave him a look of reproach and then I carried on down the mountainside in sadness and sorrow.

And I had hoped actually to be able to read to you the script of the heist on a submarine film, referred to in that piece. But alas, my plans were dashed. The film as you know, was never made, but it's ghost remains a fascinating exercise in the submarine based heist genre. Although from my close reading of the excellent screenplay, it seems that the entire drama is confined to the interior of the submarine. And that's the viewer hardly sees the sea. The complexion of the maritime with the criminal has always held me in something like but not quite. Or is it perhaps the contrast between the vastness of the broiling oceans and the small market patterns of much behavior out with the law? Or is it the admixture of sense, the salt Tang of the sea mingled with core died? a hoodlum aboard a boat inhabit an utterly different register to Ganzel in an urban alleyway. I think, if one can be said to inhabit a register, for the time being, it can be said, because I just said it. And believe me, I know what I'm talking about when it comes to the sea and crime. Many people, particularly tinies are intrigued by pirates. And it's a particularly romantic vision of piracy. That's called the mind when we think of marine criminality. For me, however, there's no such as your My interest is rather in the trench coat, Fedora and snare type of law breaker propelled into a sea setting in a dingy battered by waves se or casing below decks on a tramp steamer, or even forced to take the wheel of a tugboat when it Skipper is felled by food poisoning. So a heist set on a submarine was always bound to appeal to me. Indeed, I'm surprised that I was not called on. If not to write the screenplay, then at least to act as a consultant. I'm sure I would have been able to provide valuable insights. I am not myself a criminal, and nor interestingly, have I ever been to see in any significant sense? Oh, I've paddled in it with my trousers rolled up in my boots and socks placed carefully on the pebbles True enough, more than once. But I've never been to see in the sense that say, Joseph Conrad, or Herman Melville went to see Yeah, I feel that have the producers of the abandoned submarine heist movie employed me, the film may yet have been made. I would, for example, has been able to give them quite a few tips about pumps. Authenticity is important when filming a submarine drama, whether or not it has an element of crime, and getting the pumps right can make or break success at the box office. If I'm not a sea dog, nor a criminal, I certainly know my pumps. So, though I'm unable to read the screenplay to you here, as I'd hoped to do, I have read it myself. And it's signally lacking in submarine pump authenticity, the tosspot used as an extra you will remember was to spend Matter of the film leaning against a pump looking Moreland, I do not quarrel with that per se tosspot sailors often have to lean against pumps in submarines. Whether or not a heist is imminent. When they sign up, they know that's one of the things they may be called upon to do. Along with the carrying of pails, the ring ringing of bells, and the polishing of the periscope with a rag. Never underestimate the importance of rags on submarines by the way. rags, pumps, the sea and crime. Those are my areas of hard earned expertise. I learned what little I know in the School of rags and pumps and the sea and crime that is to say, in everyday unlettered, learning in the town square of a foul and vinegary seaside resort and the torrential rain listening wrapped to shore bound sub marine sub mariners who would polished many a periscope with many IRag in their time. their testimony is often overlooked in our universities and think tanks. More's the pity.

Before the end of the show, just time to bring you some news, one might think we have enough comms to be going on with. We already have sitcoms and ROM coms and div coms and dot coms, respectively situation comedies, romantic comedies, the Divine Comedy by Dante and comedies about deferrals the small wading bird of the clover family, which breeds in the Arctic tundra. So it might be argued that yet another con is a con too many. Normally, I'd agree we're not that the latest calm is the frack calm a series of comedies about old pharma frac. As these are chiefly written by the best selling paperback or the pebble head, I suppose they might equally well be called peb cons, no doubt, one or other term will win out as the common usage, much as we say, ping pong rather than gossiper and Lawn Tennis rather than spherical type. It could be argued that there is little humor to be found in the perpetual trudging of a mad old farmer driving his bellowing cows from field to field pointlessly in all weathers through all the hours God sends. In fact, that's a view I have myself favored as explicated thoroughly in my six part television series, penitence and farm implements, which insists that farmyard life is miserable and grim and despondent and hateful and wretched and disgusting, and absolutely without comic possibility. But I recommend without the skills of pebble head, who's hilarious accounts of old farmer frack, driving his bellowing cows from field to field pointlessly have me slapping my sides and gasping for breath. The original books of course, are known as farmyard lit. And it is the films and TV series based upon them that are called frac cons or peb cons. And it's important to get this terminology right. And that's all from hooting yard. For this week. I'm a bit more cheerful, that much more cheerful when I was at the beginning of the show. So I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you're more cheerful too, if you weren't before, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
