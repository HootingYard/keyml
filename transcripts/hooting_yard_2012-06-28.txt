Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. May I suggest that you might want to hide behind your sofa? If you have a sofa while listening to this week's show, as I'm going to read three Tales of Terror, spine tingling tales, which will have you quivering with fear, and this is the first one. The ventriloquist Claude plon, was out for a spin in his jalopy. When he had a prank. He hits a lamppost, the collusion with which Renton twisted the bonnet of the jalopy, exposing part of the engine, which belt fourth jets of steam ups, said his dummy, a puppet called bunko bunko was a sock stuffed with Kpop, who had a couple of glass beads sewn on to service eyes. Sorry about that. bunco I wasn't looking where I was going, said the ventriloquist. Are you all right? I think I have suffered a whiplash injury, replied bunko, who may have been lying as To the untrained eye he looked perfectly okay. Goodness gracious, said Claude plumb, which will have to get you to the doll hospital. Why on earth would we go to a doll hospital? asked bunco I'm not a doll. I'm a sock stuffed with Kpop with a couple of glass beads sewn on to service eyes. Yes, I see your point, said plomb. Then what about a puppet clinic? Is there such a place as a puppet clinic? As bunco I have heard tell there is one in pointy town, said the ventriloquist. But we are miles and miles away from pointy town, said bunco. And I fear my whiplash may be fatal for I can already feel myself so coming to faintness and lack of oxygen to the brain pins and needles darting panes behind my glass bead and the gradual oozing of the very life out of me. This time bunco was definitely lying, or at least embroidering the truth. But Claude plon was both devoted and gullible. It would never occur to him that bunco might be trying to pull the wool over his eyes, which in the ventriloquist case were real, working eyes, not mere sewn on glass beads. There had been occasions in the past when people suggested that bunco might be a mendacious fantasy list. And plon had been so inflamed without rage that he had beaten the accusers about the head with a shovel bunco egged him on urging him to bash and bash and bash until the battery was dead. clawed plon was now in something of a panic. bunco, who was a fine Judge of distance was absolutely correct that they were very far away from point to town and its puppet clinic. Also, the prank had been severe enough to render the jalopy motionless. Crank it as frantically as he could. It was not going anywhere. Steam continued to hit from the bonnet. What are we going to do wild plon You'd better think of something quickly because I am fading fast, said bunco. It is as if I'm in a long dark tunnel, and there is an unearthly light towards which I feel impelled to go. Don't go into the light, screamed plomb remembering certain supernatural thriller films he had seen. But it's such an attractive light, said bunco. I feel drawn towards it. Claude plon could think of nothing but to repeat his shrieked words. At which point, the jalopy burst into flames. The ventriloquist and his dummy would surely have been engulfed and burned to a crisp, and not a big red fire engine screech to a halt beside them. Bells clanging and the fire been doused by untold gallons of water spurting from a hose trained upon the jalopy by three heroic firemen. seconds later, there was further clanging and an animal villans pulled up out of which poured three heroic paramedics like grabbed the ventriloquist and shoved him with skilled gentleness onto a stretcher. Never mind about me, he cried, save bunco.

But as he cried out, a needle was injected in his arm and a fast acting narcotic course through his veins, and he lost consciousness

called plon, or woke next day flat on his back in a bed in a ward of the happy Drake's Memorial Hospital. His brain was dizzy. He bought a few sink marks here and there, but was otherwise as fit as a fiddle. He looked wildly around, but there was no sign of bunco he pressed a buzzer at his bedside summoning an angel of mercy. Claude plon raved was not understood, and was dragged back into unconsciousness.

There is high on a hill in a rustic backwater some miles from pointy town, a big grim crenelated smoke blackened mansion, once the home of robber barons but now a home for the bewildered and the befuddled and the frankly bonkers clawed plots plon the ventriloquism one time star of the variety theater, has lived here for 20 years, having been delivered on a stretcher, manacled dead of night. in his room, in one of the towers, he raves and matters. He goes barefoot, for the staff have a standing instruction never to allow him anywhere near socks. His simple tunic and trousers are fastened with zips for it is thought best not to give him buttons so easily mistaken for beads of glass. He has no visitors.

There is at the foot of a hill in a rustic backwater some miles from pointy town, a rubbish dump. Over the years it has grown it is it as it is piled ever higher with waste, things discarded things bent and broken things forgotten and abandoned, big and small from lollipop sticks to wrecked jalopies within this mitten, open to the elements frayed around the edges and still bearing the singe marks from a fire 20 years ago. There is a sock. It was once stuffed with Kpop much of which has fallen out. It once had two glass beads sewn on where now there is only one sometimes twins on what strolls and beggars will come trudging through the waist in search of scraps and scantlings. It is said that when the air is still and the gold sees shrieking, a voice can be heard from somewhere in the dump. A peevish rancorous, cursing voice spitting with vituperation. Let me into the bloody light, it cries.

Well, if you're still conscious and haven't fainted it'll swooned away through terror. Here is the second spine tingling tail. One March morning, agneta and Annie fried and Benny and Bjorn became hopelessly lost in marshland. They were on their way to work picnicking engagement, for which they had been booked to perform a set of cover versions of songs by the carpenters. This was something of a departure for the Scandinavian foursome, and the circumstances were murky occasion it was said by a gambling debt Benny had accrued after a marathon game of blackjack with Richard carpenter. Hired thugs were involved and telephone calls in the middle of the night and packs of wolves. The whole business made agneta shudder and she tried to concentrate on her Piccolo practice. She had recently taken up the instrument and hoped to make her public debut with it at the picnic. But as the morning wore on, the chances of attending the picnic grew more and more remote. Their map indicated that they would have to cross screen hunahpu marshes with which they were unfamiliar. Had they listen to Hugh half bacon, the handyman gardener at their rented cottage. Perhaps they would have devised a different route and made a diversion however lengthy in order to avoid screwed whom pooch marshes altogether. But now, as a missed descended, they were hopelessly lost. There is a difference we would do well to consider between being lost and being hopelessly lost. To be lost, yet still in possession of hope suggests that with the application of common sense, or true grit, or luck, one might yet find oneself back on the correct path, or in territory one knows, or even at one's intended destination. Bjorn, for example, had once got lost in the cemetery where he went to visit the grave of Karen Carpenter. He roamed among the headstones for hour upon hour, becoming thirsty and peckish. Fortunately, it was a bright, clear day, warm but not too hot, utterly different to the kill mist hanging over screwin whom food marches on this march morning. Had Bjorn used his noggin that day, he would have done as I and my sister did when we were once searching fruitlessly in St. Patrick's Cemetery in Leytonstone in East London. For the grave of the five Franciscan nuns drowned off the Kentish knockin commemorated by Gerard Manley Hopkins in his poem, the wreck of the Deutschland 1876. And I unable to locate the grave, and with the last light of a winter's afternoon fading, we knocked on the door of a lodge at the cemetery gate, where a helpful Grave Digger named merio led us directly to the last resting place of them nuns was drowned, had beyond determined to find such a grave digger in such a log by the gates of the cemetery wherein Karen Carpenter lies buried, he had brought with him and sorry that I'm going to start that sentence again had belonged determined to find such a grave digger in such a large by the gate of the cemetery wherein Karen Carpenter lies buried, he would no doubt have been able to lay the bouquet of campion's and pansies he had brought with him in their proper place. Instead, he wandered haphazardly, and eventually trapped the flowers into a waste bin in a fit of temper. For all that he was never hopelessly lost. One cannot, on a clear day become hopelessly lost in a cemetery. By its very nature, it will be bounded by walls or railings. And even if one trudges around for hours as Bjorn did, always there is the reassurance that sooner or later one will stumble upon the cemetery limits, at which point one need merely follow the walls or railings, until one reaches the gate. But out here on unfamiliar marches in a mist with little visibility, it is possible indeed, to lose hope, and thus to become hopelessly lost, such with the circumstances as agneta and Annie fried and Benny and Bjorn stopped by a puzzle.

had any of them spoken, they would have said, Where the hell are we in Swedish, but they were too exhausted, and they simply looked at each other in silence. In spite of the trill Benny was sweating profusely, he was overdressed. Annie Fred was on the verge of tears. agneta was wondering if he might make a few toots on her Piccolo to attract the attention of any wandering Marsh guide, if such a person existed, and beyond was about to fly into a temper, Justice he had done when failing to find the grave of Karen Carpenter. The mist was so thick it hit the sun, though it was the crack of noon. There the foursome stood when all of a sudden the finger loomed towards them. It was whew half bacon, the airy well, handyman Gardner. He seemed to have materialized from nowhere. A strange smile played over his lips. Would it be the picnic spot you are looking for? he asked. I kanessa and Annie fried and Benny and Bjorn all gambled at once such was their relief. Now there was hope. You will not be finding a picnic spot in the middle of screen hunahpu Marsh's said their Savior. Was there a trace of mocking laughter in his voice or something more sinister? Come follow me, he added and he turned his back on them and it's Wellington boots splattered through the puddles. Quick now he called. Quick now he called and they understood the urgency of his word, for though he had taken on a few steps. He was already vanishing into the mist, like hurried in his wake there on Wellington booted feet getting soaked as they followed through the puddle. The eerie silence of the misty marshes was suddenly broken by the roar of a jet aircraft zooming invisible across the sky in the passenger seat, craning to look out of the window with a pair of missed probing super binoculars, cackling his head off like a villain in a Victorian melodrama was Richard carpenter. in his pocket was a wallet stuffed with cash. The bribie had ready for Hugh half bacon. He would meet the handyman gardener later in the afternoon of the now empty cottage. In the weeks and months to come. When Swedish detectives came to find traces of the foursome, Hugh half bacon would assume his most cretinous expression and mumble enigmatic yet senseless Welsh twaddle and point them in the direction of screwin hunahpu marshes, upon which the mist had never lifted, and which led nowhere, save to oblivion.

And before we go on to the third story, and just a couple of points about the last one, the anecdote about my sister and I, going to St. Patrick's cemetery to find the grave of the five Franciscan nuns commemorated by Jared Manley Hopkins is entirely true. It happened circa 19, sometime in the 90s. And in fact, there was a great digger called Mario, and he did in fact refer to the grave of them nuns watch drowned, which I now think of as the alternative title of Hopkins is Poland. And the other thing to point out, of course, is that Hugh half bacon is the Erie, Welsh handyman gardener in the owl service by Alan Garner, a book I thoroughly recommend, and there was a TV series made of it as well, which I haven't seen since it was first broadcast in 1969. Anyway, here is the third spooky story. Parts of which will be familiar if you were listening to the previous one. The raking of gravel in the ground of a rented country cottage is usually the lot of the handyman gardener who comes with the property. You will first meet him when he comes to the railway station to meet you off the train. He will load your luggage onto the brake after the briefest greeting and drive like the clappers along twisting bosky lanes. When he has to boot you outside the cottage and unloaded the luggage. He will drive off again to parks the break in a nearby barn. You will not see him again for some hours until evening. When looking out of the cottage window, you will spot him raking the gravel. The next morning after a slap up breakfast and it being a sunny day. You will all go for a stroll together. You will explore in a not too systematic fashion. The countryside surrounding the rented cottage, the field, the canal, the spinny the standing stones, the army firing range with it electrified fence Towards midday, returning to the cottage for a slap lunch, you will see the handyman gardener raking the gravel in the ground. One of you will try to engage him in friendly if condescending conversation, but his only response will be I know MC utterance, which you find baffling. You will discuss your bathroom and over lunch before your afternoon nap, you will look out of the window, but there will be no sign of the handyman gardener. So you will see his rake leaning against a low wall next to the fruit bed. That evening, he will appear for about half an hour raking the gravel. The next day you will go for a stroll after breakfast again. This is when you will learn that other than the fields and the canal and the spinny and the standing stones and the army firing range with its electrified fence. There is nothing else of interest to see in the countryside. On your way back to the rented cottage, you will decide to pick the brains of the handyman gardener and you devise a series of questions to ask of him. How extensive is the farm to which the fields belong? Where does the canal begin and end has any event of local historical significance ever taken place in the spinny? What legends are associated with the standing stones? You will decide not to make any queries regarding the army army firing range with its electrified fence, mindful as you are of national security. But when you arrive back at the cottage, the handyman gardener will not be there. His rake will be leaning against the low wall next to the fruit bed. After a brief exchange of views, you will decide to walk the short distance to the bomb. You will peek inside there is the break where is the handyman gardener after lunch, and after your afternoon nap, you will gather in the living room.

Frank Key  22:20
All those questions about the fields and the canal and the spinny and the standing stones in the army firing range with electrified fence will seem so much hogwash. Now, you will have quite a different set of questions all of which relate to the handyman Gardner. What is his name? Who pays his wages? What does he do other than rake gravel and collect people from the railway station in the break? Where does he sleep? You will discard a subjective question about whether he is a deaf mute on the basis of his gnomic utterance the day before. The then your ears will prick up you will hear outside the cottage, the raking of gravel. But when you pile outside to approach the handyman gardener and fire questions at him, he will already be gone. The following day will pass without any sign of the handyman gardener. The gravel will go on raked by Wednesday morning, in the absence of any other focus for your attention, you will be wholly consumed by the handyman gardener. That will almost be a whoop of joy when shortly after breakfast appearing out of the window. You see him raking the gravel the previous evening, in the course of animated discussion around a blazing fire, you will have decided to delegate one of your number to approach the handyman gardener to put your questions to him. Your thinking will have been that he may open up to one whereas he may be intimidated by all 16 of you. Now you will wait in the living room crowded around the window while one goes out and strolls nonchalantly up to the handyman gardener. You will be somewhat surprised that he does not pause in his raking of the gravel during the conversation that ensues. Later there will be disappointment intermixed with mild outrage when it is reported that in on answer to such questions as your delegates managed to frame the handyman gardener responded only with baffling gnomic utterances, you will feel yourselves back at square one. The next day, trudging disconsolately after breakfast by the fields and the canal and the spinny and the standard stones and the army firing range with it. electrified fence, there will be common agreement that the handyman gardener is a half word, it will be decided to pay him no more attention and to discover other points of rustic interest, though what they might be will tack your ingenuity. This will be the most dangerous time. For now, the handyman gardener has the measure of view, his patient raking of the gravel, his disappearances, his deliberately baffling utterances his leaving the break untouched in the barn. All have served their purpose. He is almost ready to strike. The following Saturday, as on the Saturday before the handyman Gardner will drive the break to the railway station and collect the people who have rented the cottage for a week. Only he will know as he nods the briefest of greetings to them that there is no chance that they will survive that long.
