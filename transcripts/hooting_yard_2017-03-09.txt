It's a field, it's an electromagnetic field, and it's not the air. So that this is Episode One of hooting yard in the electromagnetic field. And I'm going to, as usual, it's exactly the same as hooting out on the air basically, I babble at you for 28 and a half minutes or so. And one windy morning in the late 1950s. Dobson became fixated with the desire to have a type of Plum named after him. Imagine the thrill he said to marigold crew over breakfast, going to the fruit ORS and asking for a half pound bag of Dobson's marigold Chu said nothing in reply, merely casting her eye over Dobson in precisely the way a compositor might look at a pamphleteer. Dobson had a very flimsy grasp of matters botanical and had never grown any fruit in his life. He was ready to acknowledge that these were distinct disadvantages. If the world was ever to be enhanced by a plum called Dobson, drastic activity was required. After breakfast, putting on a pair of second hand Winkle pickers, he prompt stuff to the kiosk by the pilot on the patch of waste ground by the sewage plant, over which loomed the immensity of pill garlic tour, and above it, a sky blue and clear and without any sign of an imminent hailstorm. unaccountably the kiosk was shot and not simply shot but boarded up, covered over with large rectangular panels of reinforced cardboard hammered into place with dozens of big fat nails. No signage could be pasted onto any of the panels to explain this startling state of affairs whenever anything changed within his family, or baileywick, however, slightly Dobson was avid to be told about it, greedy for details and ever on the lookout for signs and announcements and bulletins. In the absence of which he was liable to have a neurasthenic attack, and then little cries, just like Edgar Allan Poe when he got the jitters, or the wild boy of ever wrong when deprived of potatoes. On this day, however, so consumed with the out of print pamphleteer with his plumb plan, that he sailed on past the boarded up kiosk fleet in his Winkle pickers, and carried on along the lane, and buffing the sewage plant annex, past the clown Hospital in the vinegar distillery, and the bottomless Vita pit until crossing sawdust bridge. He approached a tobacconist here Dobson, he might find the publication he was seeking, for in addition to a range of pungent cigarettes and cigarillos and pipe tobaccos from the more benighted regions of the earth. The shop stopped a few magazines and penny dreadfuls and hastily pasted together prog rock fanzines alongside the complete works of john Ruskin in pirated additions. It was quite a tobacconist as he promised closer to the Gordy doorway however, the pamphleteers path was blocked by a peasant, leading an improbably numerous herd of goats to pasture. Dobson had no option but to spam wait while goat after goat after goat after goat after goat passed slowly by. Just as our pamphleteer knew nothing of botany, it may be that the reader or listener is ignorant of the goat world. Briefly then gota cloven, hooved and satanic and their milk has a cue really Jyoti flavor. And they come in a number of varieties, including the newborn, and the toggenburg, and the Anatolian black and the booted, and the fainting and the finish landrace. Sometimes such goats were among the flock that passed in front of Dobson, who sat down on a tuffet and ate some curds and whey cartons of which he kept in his pocket as emergency snack solutions.

By the time the last of the goats cracked, passed, and the weight of the tobacconist was cleared, it was lunchtime, and the shops shattered had been pulled down, and the tobacconist himself was fast asleep in the sort of man caught behind his counter. Undaunted for there was still fires in his head regarding the plump project. Dobson press gone beyond the swimming pool and across Yoko Ono Boulevard, skirting the miasma of gramineus. Past to Brooks run babbling and the other and babbling past a bear colony and a bee sanctuary passed a second shot tobacconists until he reached old mob purgatives newsagent and hazardous chemical waste compound. There is relief he found it neither boarded up nor closed for lunch, and skipping past the life sized cardboard cutout of Jethro towels Ian Anderson, playing his flute while standing on one leg, which old mar purgative kept in the porch. Dobson entered. How now mistress P. cried Dobson in an unnervingly cheery tone. Are you a mystery shopper snapped back the ancient proprietress both her face and her voice curdled with spite. She was a proper caution. Oldsmar purgative and as long ago lost whatever marbles her God had given her, her God being a household God, hang on a nail at the back of the shop wooden with savage talons in the shape of a crow with vermilion plasticine blobs for eyes. It held her in Thrall though he was a fairly regular customer Dobson was used to old mob purgatives forgetfulness, and he did not take umbrage or being unrecognized. no mystery shopper I he shouted in the foolish syntax intended to deploy when speaking to shopkeepers. I am bussan humble White, who seeks a copy of the current issue of so you want to buy or rent an orchard, the weekly magazine packed with much advertising of a fruity orchard nature. Old mar purgative gulped. Dobson waved a wand in the air said something in rhyming couplets about frogs and toads and newts and sparrows, and sad little hop and skip. a burning desire was to become a character in a fairy tale or nursery rhyme and to frighten children. But the pamphleteer was a grown man, and he had seen these shenanigans before, so he ignored our prerogative and stepped over to the magazine rack. Various titles were shoved none to tie Domi into the battered white slot wire slots of the spanned mostly publications in foreign languages, or languages invented by teenage science fiction enthusiasts, such as Zig bolg as spoken by the super ignorant Zig bulga raw in the long running radio, serial pie shop and Deep Space Nine. By the time Dobson had finished, rummaging fruitlessly through the tab, His hands were filthy, so he bought a jumbo cube of disinfectant goo before bidding almar purgative farewell. Outside the sky was black and the air was thick with pinging hailstones. Dobson scampered to a cow buyer for shelter. It was empty of cows for this was Thursday, the day when cows in those parts were taken on excursions. Six hours later, when the hailstorm ceased, Dobson trudged home, taking a different route along the canal towpath past the duck pond and the dirigible hanger and the Museum of whisks past Pang Hill orphanage and the disgusting pit, past large imponderables and smaller enigmas. And finally up the lovely lane, lined with hailed drenched Fox gloves and toadflax.

marigold coo without supervising some cows on a cow excursion. Dobson did not even pause to remove his Winkle pickers, but sat straight down at his escrow suar and wrote at one sitting the untitled and unpublished piece, which scholars have dubbed notes pursuant to the unraveling of the pamphleteers plumbed plan. One windy morning in the late 1950s, he wrote, I became fixated with the desire to have a type of plumb line laughter me knowing nothing of plums and not much about fruit in general. I had upon the idea that by buying or renting my own orchard, I would have the leisure to experiment. In my mind's eye, I saw myself leaping out of bed every morning, and come rain or shine, sprinting off to my orchard, there to propagate plum trees to study them with such rigor. But before long, I would know all there was to know about plums, both the minutiae and the big picture. I would have a shed in my orchard, which would become the world's finest plum library. I would spend entire afternoons paring seeds and bulbs and plum stones, at first in ignorance. But gradually, with ever greater perspicacity, I would dig and mulch and prune and cut, I would direct birds scarifiers and familiarize myself with the workings of a shotgun. And then, one day years hence, when so close with the resemblance between a plum and my brain that it would baffle the most expert of fruit men, I would grow an entirely new type of plum, and I would call it the Dobson and that's my name would be immortal. Such was my dream. The very first step to realizing it was to obtain a copy of the current issue of that most excellent magazine. So you want to buy or rent an orchard. I strode out of doors with the vigor of a man 60 years younger, plumb the dism. As I walked, I have the four last songs by Richard Strauss, one after another in the wrong but to me preferred order. The sky was blue and clear, with no hint of hail. Alas, my efforts to find a copy of the magazine came to naught. Then came the hail, such teeming hail as I have never seen, I sheltered for hours in a deserted cow buyer, and with every ping of a hail stone upon its corrugated iron roof, the more dejected I became crushed by misery, I was almost tempted to the stupidity of pleading with old mob purgatives wouldn't household CRO God was is actually a weed that I would fail at the first hurdle. Would I abandoned my plan plan simply because unbeknownst to me, so you want to buy or rent an orchard had ceased publication seven years ago, around the time of and because of the Korean War? It pains me to say that the answer to both these questions is yes. I sit here in my squelching second hand Winkle pickers gripping my pencil, like a dying man's straw, and I peer into the future. And I know the shattering truth, that there never ever will be a plum called Dobson. human weakness, the puddle of a million dreams

One vile broiling August afternoon, Blodgett sold his birthright for a mess of pottage ever that Weaver dealer. He then immediately sold the mess of pottage to a wealthy fool for 30 pieces of silver. Blodgett licked his lips and punch the air with his hairy fist. At last, he thought, I have sufficient funds to organize a picnic in the garden of guests cemani Blodgett traveled says by hot air balloon, it was accompanied by his next door neighbors at the time, a peevish couple who rarely spoke directly to each other, but babbled incessantly Blodgett who eventually stuffed cotton volunteers is for all his faults, Blodgett was a singularly honorable fellow, and he felt a sense of obligation to Mr. And Mrs. Fagor for a favor done to him long ago. Though he could no longer remember what it was. For us, it was able to kill two birds with one stone, as they say, by fulfilling a personal picnicking ambition at the same time as repaying a moral debt by providing a treat for an elderly impoverished couple. The picnic hamper was an exact replica scaled down of the balloon basket. The Wicker, of which the wicker of which both were woven had even come from the same wicker factory. Blodgett has stopped the hamper before the voyage with much provena from its favorite picnic supplies shop. without bothering to quiz Mr. And Mrs. fag Ash on any dietary preferences they may harbor he had spent some of his pieces of silver on sausages and lemonade and sandwich paste, and pork scratchings and Flan and jam and buns, and Sal Thomas, and mashed potatoes and raw liver and marang, and plums and milk. The threesome took it in turns to keep flies away by waving fans of the same wicker as the hamper and the balloon basket. Flies they knew would find a way to wriggle through the tiniest gaps in the wickerwork if it had been violent broiling back at home, it was even more viral and more broiling in the Garden of Gethsemane feminie when their balloon basket thumped Earth. Blodgett himself broke out in a sweat so deep, it was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground like Christ. Hearing a series of bangs from inside the hamper, he realized the sausages were exploding. Mrs. Fagor, who was a devout Catholic, suggested they seek shelter from the sun in the midst named grotto of the agony, and as they staggered towards it, she explained the misnomer, dating back to the removal of a stone in the 14th century. Blodgett found it hard to follow what she was saying, and resolve to consult a reference book when he returned home after the picnic. He was beginning to wonder how sinful it would be to abandon Mr. And Mrs. fagot in the Grotto and make the trip back alone. In all the years he had dreamed of this picnic, Blodgett never envisaged that he would find himself sitting in a dark cave eating raw liver in the company of a pair of scowling geriatrics, even though lemonade had gone flat due to a bottling mishap, as he chewed and glugged and swatted away flies, he reflected that perhaps he would have been better not to sell his mess of pottage, which even now the wealthy fool would be lapping up in the cool luxury of a shaded Arbor. And He further reflected that it might have been better never to have sold his birthright for the mess of pottage in the first place. For what had he gained, what had he gained? It was this thought as gloomy as the gloom of the Grotto. That was bloating in Blodgett brain when inside the hamper, the last unexploded sausage exploded with a mighty bang. Birds scattered from the branches of the olive trees outside.

Forgive me, Mr. And Mrs. Fagor for I know not what I Do blurted Blodgett he stood up flicked crumbs from his person and sprinted out of the Grotto of the agony across the garden to the hot air balloon. He clambered into the basket and set the burners roaring, and very soon he was aloft, and he sailed away into the blue. And the source of that piece is picnics of disillusionment by Dobson out of print.

He sold me a Carlsbad plum. He was a traveling fruit raw, and he soon went on his way, swinging his basket. The dog did not immediately follow some yards along the lane, the fruit or stopped and turned his head and called out to the dog. The dog's name was flaps. Here flaps, cried the traveling fruiter in a rich baritone that would have done him credit on the stage. flaps relinquish the toffee apple wrapper and scampered towards his master and continued beyond him along the vein. panting I have no idea what sort of dog It was. It was soon out of sight. But the fruit did not appear at all worried. He too, continued on his way more slowly than his dog. on the spur of the moment, I decided I wanted to buy a second karlsbad plum. I got up from the lane side bench on which I had been sitting on followed the fruit for I did not call out to Him for the simple reason that I am mute. When I was tiny, I was witness to an abomination. You can draw your own inference from that pair of snippets. In any case, I'm sure the traveling fruiter is a more interesting character than I am. With the gleam in his eye and his theatrical voice and his swinging basket and his dog flaps. He is the type to gain attention whether he wishes to or not. I, by contrast, could have sat all day upon the bench without attracting the attention of passing persons or dogs or above birds. The fruiter himself would have strolled on past oblivious, had I not hailed him and brought him to a halt to buy my Carlsbad plum from him. voiceless, my hailing method was to flail my arms or to wave a stick. Now to buy as an afterthought, a second Carlsbad plumb, I had to catch up with him further along the line. So I sprinted. Doing so took me back in reverie to my youth, where I won many a medal, running round and round and athletics track wearing a singlet to which both numbers were attached both front and back. I usually wore the number nine. I'm older. creakier now and I was puffed out by the time I came alongside the traveling fruiter panting like flaps I slowed to match the fruit or his pace. I held off the cows bad plum I had already bought and with my other hand pointed at the fruit or as basket and by some other signals may claim to him that I wanted to buy a second Carlsbad plum to reflect this transaction. We both stopped dead on the line. Looking up ahead, I saw flaps mixture rating against the trunk of a lonely you

the fruit her handed me a second Carlsbad plum, and in turn I gave him some coinage. There was still a gleam in his eye, a green so resplendent in dazzled me. While I seldom dazzled by fruit rose in this day and age, Lord knows what Lord knows how much water flaps and lap from his bowl or from a real fat morning, for even as I was been dazzled by the fruit rose green, I saw out of the corner of my eye that his dog continued to expand a stream of piss against the yew tree in an unstoppable flow. I worried he might poison the roots, for you would wither and woodsmen with axes would come to chop it down. And it would all be the fault of flaps, and by extension of the fruit for what is I still dream when in a farm town a year hence, he sat at a tavern table, drinking his pot and read in the local paper of the shriveled and felled yew tree and cast his mind back to that summer's morning when he sold a brace of Carlsbad plums to a mute and flaps relieved himself his jet of canine peice powerful and prolonged drenching the trunk of that very you sinking and seeping through the soil, weathering the roots.

That is the end of this week, hooting out on the air which this week was called hooting yard in the electromagnetic field and may continue to be called that I'm quite tempted to change the name entirely. So it's time to go but before I do, let me just mention to you that on the heating yard website at hooting gmail.org you can see a photograph of the Danish cheese maker, Rasmus false Trump, father of hemric false strop. And Rasmus was the person who put Danish trees on the map. In the 20th century, apparently one of the great Danish trees makers rasma salt scrub, and there's a photograph of him with his wife and his infant son who I was an infant who I think you did infant son Henrik, who later took over the family trees business. why I'm telling you this. I have no idea. But it's interesting, isn't it? Bye bye.

Life's like that, isn't it? I mean, the other day I was walking in the West End and suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers and wanted to touch my tears. So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema normally, of course, I didn't go in but that day I saw something that really moved me. I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you.
