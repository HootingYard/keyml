Good evening this is indeed resonance FM Yes, resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is who sing yard on the air. I have learned to be very picky when it comes to choosing my hiking companions. Once I tramped the malls with a skittish widow woman, another time I tramped other malls in the company of a pig ignorant popping J. These hikes taught me much and they were hard lessons from which my immortal soul took weeks to recover sprawled on a pallet in a post hiking clinic, I have time to review my entire approach to hikes. One thing that became absolutely clear to me is that I need must have a companion of some kind, for I am temperamentally unsuited to solo hiking, due to the particular admixture of blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm, which makes me what I am. I did once go on a hike all by myself, and it was a disaster. I got hopelessly lost, entangled in a clump of Bracken dive bombed by a flock of angry guillemots, drenched by rain and stung by hailstones, apprehended by 30 border guards and subjected to interrogation in a subterranean interrogation chamber. The Cold Stone water which was stained with the blood of peasants. I was entangled in a clump of doors. waylaid by band diffie, buffeted by gales accused of trespass and a top secret military installation, deafened by the relentless pounding of Voodoo drums, in tangled in a clump of nettles, haunted by hallucinate revisions of the skittish widow woman and the pig ignorant popinjay, poisoned by befouled water from a deceptively endemic real, attacked by tiny flying biting things strafed by fighter jets, and tangled in a clump of call form. This merged by the excreta of starlings savaged by weasels battered and bruised after toppling into a Haha, almost suffocated in a slop sock accident lacerated by barbed wire, discombobulated by the jumbling of my blood and black bile and yellow bile and phlegm. ridiculed by wayfaring minstrels, burned by the sun stung by bees entangled in a clump of fizzles threatened by bellowing cows and lost, lost, hopelessly lost. Never again must you go hiking alone, shouted Dr. Heinrich Wiens by post hike, traumatic neurasthenia syndrome counselor. At my first consultation, he actually forbidden me ever to hike again full stop, but I protested I would die if I did not hike. This was after twaddle, of course. But I deployed the full gamut of my thespian skills, learned at the feet of Sir Donald Sinden and Bruce Willis, and Dr. Weems was convinced I spoke the truth.

Ah, you poor fellow, he shouted. So if I understand you correctly, you will keel over and die in agony unless you regularly embark upon jaunty hiking expeditions across more than Heath, through woods and forests, up hills and mountains and down veils and delve. To rich flagrant poppycock. I responded with a nod saying up coyote, mother beeper Willis ism, which never fails to do the trick. In subsequent meetings with Dr. Wiens, we move from his consulting room and an agreeable Swiss chalet. His secret underground laboratory. Here in tenebrous gloom, he induced a catatonic trance by babbling below that skin gibberish into my ears, and then proceeded with pincers and slices and a suction tube and a funnel on a petri dish to extract samples of my blood and my black bile and my yellow bile and my Flynn. When I regained consciousness, he showed me the jar in which he had mixed my four humors together. By means of a pet pet, he shouted, I'm going to feed this goose diluted with duck pond water to my experimental squirrels, then we'll see what we shall see. I canceled my next appointment with Dr. Wiens. I had no doubt he was a very sensible therapist, but the viewer of the hike grew too strong for me. Each morning, I would awake to find that during the night while asleep, I had kitted myself out in full hiking gear, the boots, the socks, the etc. And it was and I was even clutching a sturdy stick in my hiking gloved hand. Clearly my unconscious mind was desperate to go roaming across malls and Heath and through woods and forest and up hills and mountains and down veils and delve. Once or twice, I was reckless enough to start out a loan that I never got further than my garden gate. Somehow I heard the guttural shouting of Dr. Weems in my brain, and I knew he was right. First did I begin my search for a new hiking companion. I loitered down by the docks and in Penny arcades and on traffic islands in post offices and department stores near electricity pylons. At fashion shoots and awnings in railway station canteens and airport trapline sees on key sides and in souks. Whenever I lighted the skittish widow woman and the pig ignorant popping dry, descended upon me, imploring me to take them hiking, but I rebuffed them with Sinden isms and witticisms or in extremists. I bashed them with a shovel. It was around this time stormy mark, that I began to wonder if perhaps Dr. Heinrich Wiens might be the ideal person to accompany me on a hike. It was true that he was shouty and guttural that he had a we had a professional doctor patient relationship that he lumbered about in on crutches, that his table manners were as disgusting as friends catheters, that his Buffon was riddled with beetles and other creepy crawlies, and that he had never shown the slightest interest in the great outdoors. Indeed, that is sickly power and near blindness suggested he never ventured outside at all. Yet wait against this where many points in his favor? Well, not many, but some. Well, perhaps not some, but one. And if not even one if in fact, he might prove to be the most odious companion a hiker could ever hike with. Still, I was desperate, and surely not even doctor Weems could be as vile a fellow hiker as the skitude widow woman or the pig ignorant poppin J. When stormy March turn to stormy April, I cast aside all doubts and caught a bus to the slope on which is agreeable, shallow, teetered.

I wrapped upon his door with my sturdy stick, but answer came there none. Then I noticed that the door was ajar. I pushed it open gingerly. For I find that ginger Enos is in never invariably the best approach. When pushing open the ajar doors of chalets no matter how agreeable they are. Equally gingerly I entered the chalet lobby. There was no sign of life unless you count the sudden darting across the floor from wainscott to wainscott. of one of the doctors experimental squirrels. The sight of it made me shudder and I was about to turn on my heel and wait at the bus stop for the next bus back to town when I spotted something resting on the chalet lobby telephone table. It was not a telephone. It was a voodoo Ranga bag and it had been torn, open, bitten open Saturday. With dripping fangs and its contents was strewn on the table top. Lock stones, Snake bones, lizard drawers, squirrel teeth, backbones, frog bones, black hen feathers and bones, black the lamb wool, dove hearts, mole skins, images of racks and clay can be made of brown sugar mixed with a river, mud sulfur salt, an alum and vegetable potions. I shuddered again. And while I was in mid shutter, the trapdoor leading down to the underground laboratory creaked open, and from the few months black depths emerged. Dr. Heinrich Weems it was he Yes, it was not he, for as I discovered by poking him with my stick, he had been transformed into a zombie. But what a zombie. A brain was being bereft of life, the walking dead he might be, but one with a rucksack and a woolly sweater, and a lanyard across around his neck, from which dangled a transparent plastic pocket crammed with maps. a zombie with stout boots and thick socks on a sturdy stick. He was a zombie ready for a long and arduous hike. As we strode together out of the chalet into the great outdoors, clouds gathered and the sun shone, we set off for the more than the heath for the woods and the forests for the hills and the mountains for the veils and the Delve. within me, stirred my blood and black bile and yellow bile and phlegm in perfect harmony within my hiking companion, the zombie that once had been Dr. Wiens. Nothing stirred nothing at all, safer a magnificent, impeccable, brainless devotion to the hike.

To what nobler calls can a man devote his energies and talents from the bin muscleman of clothings tissa pursuits both noble and perilous, but then do not all noble deeds contain at least a trace chance of peril. that perhaps is an inquiry for another time, when the moon is high and fires are met, and the cocoa has been poured into the cocoa cups on stirred stirred well with the cocoa spoon. V peril inherent in the bitmap format of clothings. Dennis lies in the brute fact that the source of most clothings is high up in towers, and towers, even the strongest of them, however solidly they are built, will crumble in time crumble to ruin. Once ruin has come all clothings ceased, we are concerned with that period before at a ruination when the towers still stand. Just about excuse me, we are concerned with that period before after ruination when the tower still stands just about when it teeters in high winds, when masonry is dislodged, by the frantic of crows and bat, when in crumble, month is slow, but certain, then you will hear still the atrocious clangs then you are called noble valiant in the face of peril to be muffle as best you can. Wait, Dennis, wait. Your agility is admirable, but it will not do to go skittering up the side of that crumbling tower speedy as a spider in just your fair isle sweater and ski jumpers, leggings and chelsea boots on equipped with what do you intend to be muffle the clothings Ah, now you realize the drawbacks of you're in Petra with vim comm which will repeat to the hangar where he's kept a startling array of this and that.

See Dennis, there is cotton wall and wall and loud blankets, and either town or two lagging meant for hot pipes, costumers muffs and much similar material. All of it just the ticket for the achievement of your noble pursuit. improvises swimming around your shoulders Dennis with string or rhythms. You must keep your arms free to clamber yet you must carry up stuffings for the muffle month. And if God help you, you should lose your footing and plunged Earth before you reach the top of the tower. Such stuffings will soften the impact. bruising there will be but no broken bones like groaning on a path in a clinic on a hill.

Frank Key  16:14
It was a high tower, ancient and crumbling. I thought it was for Dennis and I to Don hats of hardness as we knelt down in its removing to say a prayer before he climbed. Then we stood in shook hands. The whole impact you're with young kid and is no less noble Parson, and he was up defying gravity impervious to peril. Oh, so valiant. So misty was the morn he was soon out of sight. I shoved marshmallows into my ears against the awful clangs and lit a cigarette. High above the very top of the tower mango weighted mango, maddened by clothings deafened, hunchbacked, distressingly twisted and shriveled and vile meeting about possessive in human strength and the savagery of a bird of prey. Mango waited. I ground the bathroom my cigarette beneath my boot and turned away and walked jaunty and carefree and lascivious off along the towpath of the canal towards Dennis's dilapidated heart to pay my respect to his widow.

JOHN just asked me What about ne'er do wells indeed there shouldn't be near do wells in their speaking of ne'er do wells. I without strolling by the canal we have a morning when I was accosted by an acronym, and as Bo carrying Rafi and of narrow Yoruba mentality, the ground something unintelligible at me in his barbaric in its brecker retry countered by telling him as bravely as I could, that I offered him the chance to turn himself from an acronym into an across stick, and as bow carrying Rafi and of spiritual transfiguration in Christ. without waiting for his reply, I whipped out my pocket out of my pocket, my much thumbed paperback copy of the Selected Poems of duck mesmerizing Victorian Jesuit, Jared Manley Hopkins, and immediately began to declare, in a booming voice, God's granya The world is charged to the grand jury of God, it will flame out, like shining from shock foil, it gathers to a greatness, like the use of oil crushed. The acronym was to sank in his vacuity to react in any perceptible way. But the words of Hopkins are shocking and mighty, the irresistible and I knew I had the upper hand nearby on early for me the bug unfold, unfold its wings and soared high into the heavens. My work was almost done. I took the acronym by the hand and led him towards the church, where father Boggess waited with an old rugged cross, and a handful of nails. I patted my pocket feeling for the hammer I carried there. I look forward to landing the first blow nailing to the rough wood, the filthy Rafi and hand I held in mind. So that was about an acronym and an across stick. And that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it.
