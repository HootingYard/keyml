This is resonance 104 point four FM live from London. It's 6:30pm on Thursday, the second of August. Here is the news. And we go straight over to our reporter on the ground praxis talese Hubbard. prax What is the situation there on the ground?

Frank Key  00:20
Well, okay, what the people on the ground here are telling me is that the situation is very fluid. That's something you might expect of the sea rather than the ground. But there it is. What I've been able to see here on the ground is soil, some mud, a certain amount of silt, sparse bits of lawn, sand, then large swathes of scrub land covered in gorse and Bracken and nettles, until you come into more built up areas where you'll find grit and gravel, and then great big paving slabs and flagstones, asphalt and tarmac and concrete. Also, on the ground is a teeming myriad of insect life, tiny little ants and beetles and all sorts of things that creep and slither and scuttle, you have to be very careful not to crush them underfoot. Obviously, my boots are here on the ground to for the time being. Apart from in the very muddy parts where there's been heavy rainfall, it's pretty solid. Despite the situation being fluid, as I pointed out, gradients, very parts of the ground are flat, but then there are steeper bits. And in the urban areas, you'll find steps and stairs. I've yet to come upon any quicksand. But what people on the ground here are telling me is that there are patches of it. So one has to be one has to tread very carefully.

Unknown Speaker  01:44
And what are the people on the ground saying about the situation?

Frank Key  01:48
Well, it depends who you speak to old and whereas on whereabouts on the ground they are. Earlier I was on the ground just south of here on an outcrop of limestone. There, I was told the situation was very much what you'd expect a real sense of limestone, no sign of quicksand, and certainly no paving slabs or flagstones, but come further north, traveling across scrub and more land. And you can find yourself in marshland which is barely ground at all. In fact, it's sopping wet as I found out to my cost. Luckily, I have a pair of Wellington boots. What the people on the ground there told me is that it's always been marshy and foggy. So the situation is always fluid. And it gets even more fluid during the rainy season, if you can believe that. There's a great deal of anxiety among the people on the ground, looking up for signs of clouds.

Unknown Speaker  02:45
But But clouds are in the sky, not on the ground. Is that right? prax.

Frank Key  02:50
That's absolutely right. org, as a person on the ground here told me earlier, the sky is not the ground. But interestingly, just as the ground is scattered with that teeming maryada of life forms I was telling you about. So is the sky. It's just that the life forms tend to be different things with wings, for example, and as well as tiny insects, you get birds, some of which can be huge in comparison.

Unknown Speaker  03:18
We know about the people on the ground. But are there people in the sky too?

Frank Key  03:24
Yes, there are. Most of them tend to be in airplanes or helicopters. But you occasionally find a so called bird man attract with a pair of balsa wood wings attached by a kind of harness, flinging himself off a cliff top or a promontory. What's interesting is that those people tend to become people on the ground pretty quickly, usually within minutes. There's one faction among the people on the ground who claim there are other people in the sky, what we might call ethereal beings or angels. Also with wings, but not balsa wood ones. They seem to have their wings already attached and don't need harnesses. They can also remain airborne. So I suppose we could say they really are people in the sky, unlike the Birdman.

Unknown Speaker  04:13
And have you managed to talk to any of these people in the sky? procs

Frank Key  04:18
not yet, all because I have been putting out feelers,

Unknown Speaker  04:21
feelers, like for tendrils and antennae of certain insects and platforms.

Frank Key  04:27
That's right org. I've been putting out my feelers trying to arrange to talk to representatives of the sky people. They of course will have a different perspective to the people on the ground. And it will be interesting to find out what they make of the situation. Whether they also think it's fluid, much depends, I think on whether it rains.

Unknown Speaker  04:47
This rain cracks I understand it begins in the sky and comes down to the ground.

Frank Key  04:53
Not exactly it actually begins in the sea goes up into the sky and then it comes down to the ground.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
And what are the people on the ground saying about that?

Frank Key  05:03
Well, again, it depends very much on who you talk to org. Some people put their collars up on unfurl umbrellas and say things like mustn't grumble. Others slosh about in puddles and they do grumble. And I've spoken with a few people here on the ground who dance strange gigs, hoping to retract the rain.

Unknown Speaker  05:25
Were they the people on the limestone outcrop?

Frank Key  05:28
No, they weren't. I think it's important to note that there are all sorts of different people on the ground, depending on what patch of ground you're talking about.

Unknown Speaker  05:37
I'll have to cut you short there. prax. But before you go, you've told us about the people on the ground and the people in the sky. But are there any people under the ground? There are?

Frank Key  05:51
Some of them are minors or potholders, some international women of mystery like Primrose dent in her sinister subterranean headquarters, and some weird blind dial bino troglodyte beings who really are rather frightening,

Unknown Speaker  06:09
fascinating stuff. That was paksa talese Hubbard, there are reporter on the ground. To Jay wake now where cows have wandered down the main street in the early morning, Dawn.

Frank Key  06:53
Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM and this is hooting out on the air A few minutes later than usual after that news bulletin about the situation on the ground. Many thanks to pansy cradle drew for pretending to be old, the newsreader. And here comes the chrome horn man. He's had a pallava he has to solve a crosstex for his mother. She's blind and so is her dog. The dog's name is spinach. Spinach is a good name for a dog. That's what mother thinks. She's 19. Now when every domestic pet she's ever had since she was a tiny toddler she has called spinach, the donkey, the hamster, a kitten, several goldfish. certain other types of fish rabbits and budgerigars all spinach cheese. This might be called mono mania. The crumb horn man looks kindly upon his mother. He is a good son. Take a look at him now. A shopping lists scrunched in his fist prancing up the street. He is on his way to the butchers. The Butcher is a caution. He's cyclopean and bears dueling scars. lit by the moon he howled a proper butchers how he keeps a vase of peonies on his mantle. Oh for campion's and oxalates today it is sausages for the crumble man. The sausages have the name of an English County, the butcher, the butcher, the butcher with his meat cleaver. how sharp it is and fearsome. He went to the blade on a whetstone behind his kiosk. You can hear the screen screen screen before dawn. He wakes the town sausages bought on goes the crumb horn man pastor haberdasher and the aquarium past all things out into the golf and nettles followed by geese, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, but he is not pied and he has no pipe and this is not Hamelin. It is an English county with the same name as the sausages or it might be if things fit neatly together. He pops a boiled sweet into his mouth. It is a spangle invisible threads bind him to the past. he smacked his lips. The sound alert an otter. The crumble man shook off the geese and now he has an otter. He sits down by the river. He has to solve across sticks for his mother. The wind is fair, the wind is foul. The crumb horn man throws in the towel. It is carried downstream towards the sea. The otter follows him back to mother Dog and author in mother's parlor, the one blind the other not. What a pallava umbilically linked is once he was he makes a pot of tea. He ties a knot in a dish cloth and cuts it out of the window. And here comes Mr. Snip edge, toiling along the line. He is lame and pale and valiant. What whoa what Whoa. And tally tally whoa to then the chrome horn man makes himself scarce. He takes himself to a place of defeat. He leaves the sausages on the kitchen counter. Where would he be if he were not here? over the sea and in a capital city loud with life, turning up the carnival sparks and pangs wearing a hat at a jaunty angle getting into tangled bumping things.

Frank Key  11:02
Instead, he pairs into the distance through the mist. The glue factory has closed down. He keeps one arm in a sling for old times sake. He was once the invalid invalid, just as the butcher is the butchers butcher. It says I want to sign on his wall. There is a red wax seal embossed on it of heraldic significance. Red wax to in the crumb horn man's hair, a barber put it there for a prank. Little gobbets tiny orbs. He is a very peculiar barber shunned by many and that is no surprise. The barber is down away from the butcher and the haberdasher in the aquarium and around the corner ever in shadow. It is where they hold table wrapping meetings with ectoplasm. The kromhout man sought his father there. He is a good son. hedges flank the abandoned glue factory. They have not been snipped for many a spring. It is a place to pine there are still nozzles to be seen among the ruins. The crumb horn man has his favorites. He has snapped thousands of photographs with a long lens. He used to use a Polaroid, Polaroid and polar bears and polar wastes. He kept them together in his head. It was a nice head mother said it was the color of curd. The author was gone from the parlor when he went back bent on his sausages. The fat sizzled in the pan. Just then Mr. snipping came toiling back along the line and began to pound on the door with his great hairy fist. Spinach dragged his ancient canine bones to the doormat and dribbled. At the same time, the telephone rang and an alarm sounded. It was pandemonium. The hospital helicopter was circling overhead. There was gunfire coming from the hills. It turned out to be a mock emergency staged by actors. Even Mr. Smith edge was not really missed a snippet at all. His part was played by an elfin amateur caked in makeup. The sausages were burned black. See, see the chrome horn man has set out again in the rain in the rain. This time he has taken a pipe. It's bowl is in the lay of the brim of his hat. So the rain does not doubt it. But the shutters are down at the butcher shop. The Butcher is gone for the day. Where is he gone to? That is what everyone is asking in a huddle at his door. Then the band strikes up that old traditional air butcher butcher Where have you been but until he comes back, they will be in the dark. BUTCHER butcher Where have you been until I come back? You will be in the dark butcher butcher What have you seen? I have seen a swan in a pond in the park. BUTCHER butcher Why is it dark? Because the shutters are down on my shop on the street. BUTCHER butcher Will you ever come back? I shall return with contaminated meat. The crumb horn man goes home sausage fellas in the downpour. He must solve a crosstex for his mother. Spinach is asleep in front of the fire. He is dreaming a dog dream of triumph and vinegar

Frank Key  15:32
It must be 40 years I think since last I saw a duck. It's not that I've consciously avoided them though I'm willing to admit that I may have done so subconsciously. But nothing is more down than the subconscious, particularly one's own. Don't you find that social pass on the notion that there may have been an element of subconscious duck avoidance? The only thing worth saying in this connection is that Vladimir Nabokov likes to call Sigmund Freud a Viennese crack. And quack of course, is the usual way we represent the characteristic sound made by ducks in this language at least. Whether I have avoided them or they me the blunt truth is that I haven't seen a duck since the last years of the war in Vietnam. I did not fight in Vietnam myself, I was too young. Nor was that Ill remember duck. I did see circa 1972, a Vietnamese duck. So far as I know, I mentioned that war merely to give some idea of how much time has passed. I could equally say since the middle years of the heath government, or since the year Ezra Pound died. Did Ezra Pound ever write a poem about ducks? I don't know his work well enough to be able to say. Certainly it will not be anything said or unsaid by Ezra Pound that propelled me into the ductless years. At the time, of course, when I saw that teal flashing in a pond in a park, I could not have foreseen that so many years would pass without my seeing another duck. Had I known I might have remarked it better, I would probably have made a note in my logbook, perhaps sad little sketch with my propelling pencil. That said, it's better that I did not, as I am a ham fisted sketcher at the best of times, my attempt might have looked like something other than a tail. There are innumerable sketches in my logbooks, both Child and Adult were the subject would be wholly unidentifiable, had I not added a written caption. I know this because in a surprising number of cases, I saw no need at the time to add a caption. And now whenever I pour over the logbooks in a fit of nostalgia, I have no idea what in the names of all the saints in heaven I'm looking at the soul certainty I can cling to, like a drowned III to a raft is that I was not sketching a tail, nor any kind of duck at any time since 1972. That narrows down the possible subject matter, but only slightly. If my sketching is so barbarous and cack handed, my one may wonder why I have continued to practice it in my log books through all these years. I could say that it's simply that I'm waiting for the lead in my propelling pencil to be exhausted. It shows no sign of ever reaching it deemed either it's a magic lead that somehow replenishes itself, or goblins replace it while I'm asleep. There can be no rational explanation. Is there though a rational explanation for my never seeing a duck for 40 long years. As I said, I've not consciously avoided them nor their habitat. In a municipal Park I often prance through at least once a week, there's even a duck pond. I grant that for at least the past several years, it's been drained and filled with filth and litter, it being that kind of Park. But one might have expected perhaps to find a stray duck investigating the area on the off chance that volunteers of a conservationist bent could have restored it to watery duck pond. There's always the possibility that there is something about me terrifying to ducks, and if indeed a stray merganser or pot child were to come waddling into the park in hopes of finding the duck pond restored to its former glory by my Scarpa behind a shrub, the first hint of my approach, but why would I think terrify a duck. It's true that I do not know enough about the inner workings of a duck brain, its psychology, if a duck could be said to have one, to give a coherent answer to that question.

Frank Key  20:16
All I will say is that it seems unlikely that I have certain attributes which would cause mental turmoil to ducks. I have never seen a duck flee from my presence, nor indeed any other aquatic creature, nor nor non aquatic creature come to that, except for such beasts as always free from humans, the nervous ones such as squirrels and some cats. And there are some beasts which, on the contrary, seem to be inexplicably attracted to me. I was once pursued on a country lane for at least 100 yards by a gaggle of honking geese. That was in the year of the fall of Saigon. The year Dmitri Shostakovich died. Did Shostakovich ever write about? Did Shostakovich ever write a divertimento about ducks? I do not know his work well enough to be able to say. I wish I did. Yes, I wish I knew more of Shostakovich. But would it be equally true to say that I wish I'd seen more seen any ducks in the past four decades? Do I feel a gaping absence in my life because of a lack of ducks? That's a hard question to answer. But if I give it a true thought, I suppose the answer has to be no. After all, if my heart was really set on seeing some ducks, there's nothing to stop me going out in search of them. There must be somewhere in promising distance a park with a duck pond still extant? One not drained and rife with filth and litter, a duck pond in which ducks happily plush. I should put on my hat and coat and walking boots right this minute and crash out the door and prance the highways and byways until I light upon such a park with such a duck pond with such duct and taking from my pocket my current logbook, I could make sketches of them and append captions. So that 40 years hence, when poring over them in a fit of nostalgia, I will be able to identify them as the duck size or in 2012 after a gap of 40 ductless years.

Frank Key  23:10
A couple of extracts about Victorian things now. The first is from Thomas Ellis, who wrote a 2004 book called fish flesh and good red herring, a gallon mouth three and a splendid book it is and it includes this. Victorian ladies who one gets the impression spent most of their lives in what is now known as socializing rarely set foot in the kitchen, except to have word with cook. But we're frequently found in hysterics, or high strikes, as the condition was vulgarly known. When visitors came to call, a young woman had to know when to stay in the room or when to make herself scarce. And while the writers on etiquette tried to be reassuring, a young girl with all the freshness of youth and the sweet dignity of womanhood has a short passport into society, which assures her a warmth of welcome. The proviso, as long as her power has pots of money was considered at once too obvious and to cause to be stated, but it's no surprise that so many of them were reduced to lying on the floor, drumming their heels and screaming. hysteria, which was according to the dictionary of daily wants, more common in females than men was characterized by low spirits a feeling of depression and anxiety, sudden involuntary grief and tears, palpitation, sickness, a sense of suffocation and the parent presence of a ball in the throat. These symptoms are or are not attended with sobs and sudden fits of laughter, convulsive twitches and contractions of the hand. And arms, finally terminating after more or less muscular contractions in insensibility, and coma. If the patient was young and robust, she was bled, but in general, it was thought sufficient to throw cold water on her. So, there you go, there's a treatment for hysteria. The next extract, isn't that not about hysteria, but it's in terms of etiquette, I think it gives a very good example of the, of a correct form of greeting. Perhaps not common at the time, but certainly one that I have thought long and hard about adopting. This. This is a passage taken from a book by Mary F. Hartman, published in 1977, called Victorian murderess is a true history of 13 respectable French and English women accused of unspeakable crimes. And this is about the husband of one of those murderer SS who may actually not have murdered him. The evidence is so so. But anyway, I think it's more his his method of greeting which we should be concerned about, and I shall review this brief passage. Although barely literate, only like cost seems to have had intellectual pretensions. He used to spend hours with an old friend who had to peg project, designing a revolution resort of barometer, and solving the vexing problem of squaring the circle. Lacoste considered himself an expert in several fields. Friends reported that his normal manner of greeting male acquaintances was to leap on them from behind with groundling noises and mock biting sounds.

Frank Key  27:42
That's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. If you if you're walking along and someone jumps on you from behind and starts making growling and biting noises, that might be me. We've got to go. But before we go, any developments in the J WIC cow situation?

Unknown Speaker  28:05
Well, thank you for asking about that. We have had news from our reporter on the ground prax that there have been no further cows cited in j work. However, there is news that some ducks may be in the area.

Frank Key  28:20
That's extraordinary. Well, thanks for that. org. And I'll be back next week, but perhaps without any news, bye bye.
