Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. This is hooting yard on the air. And my name is Frank key, and I've got a head cold. So if if the show is interrupted by violence, sneezing, in addition to the usual coughing and spluttering, you'll know why don't you just have to bear with me? Let's begin where we left off last week. See what I mean? Last week show ended, apart from some inconsequential babble, with this quotation from a short history of monks and monasteries, by Alfred Wesley with heart, published in 1900. Two monks took the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week. This they put into a file, one side of which consisted of a thin transparent crystal, the other thick and opaque. The Dark Side was shown until the center's gold was exhausted. When presto change the blood appeared by turning the other side of the file, innumerable tau pairings, bones, pieces of skin, three heads of St. Ursula and other anatomical relics of departed saints were said to cure every disease known to man. The phrase to monks took the blood of a duck in that quotation was appropriated by the poet Dennis beer pint as the title of a lengthy as yet unpublished work. It may be that he's still writing it. Excuse me, but our regular bear pond water Dan's sprawl is currently in hospital with a case of jangling Kevin pag. So news is limited. What we do know is that the poem compares the image of monks draining blood from a duck with the concept of being washed in the blood of the Lamb. Here is a brief extract. Then, then, brother Fabricius strangled another Teil hand me that retort brother Arpad so that I may decanted into this TEALS decant into it. This TEALS Gore, brother Arpad reached for the retort, and in so doing smashed and alambic there was a sound of bells. The monks were called to compline. For each canonical hour, they allocated a duck to be slaughtered for its blood at compline a tail at matins, a merganser. At prime, a pin tail, at tears, a shoveler. At sext a widgeon at known as a smooth, and at Vespers bufflehead. out in the fields, sweet little lambs, gambled and frolicked. They would not frolic for long, soon in the monastery, it would be bath time.

Interesting, isn't it? The Dennis beer pod should pick up on the phrase to monks took the blood of a duck and yet completely ignore the startling fact as revealed in the quotation that St. Ursula had three heads. Extraordinary. Anyway, Mr. askew and Mr. Width went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. They met at the foot of the hill at a point equidistant from Fort hoity, where Mr. skew was aide de camp and Fort toity where Mr. Width had charge of the goats. It did not need to to fetch and carry a pail of water, but Mr. skew and Mr. Width were brothers of the salt and whenever a pile of water was needed, either at Fort toity or at Fort toy They would arrange to meet and stroll up the hill together, arm in arm fraternally they were able to stroll rather than clamber and Panton strain, because a pathway had been cut into the hill at a very gentle gradient, winding round and round and round until it reached the top. Whether well was the well had its own pail attached to a hefty rope. Mr. skew or Mr. Width would lower this pail to fill it with well water, raise it and pull the water from the well pail into an empty pail. Either Mr. skew would have brought an empty pail from Fort hoity, or Mr. With the same from Ford hoity toity. It was within the bounds of possibility that Mr. skew and Mr. Width would both bring empty pails at the same time. But this never ever happened. The water replenishment sheduled that fought it and fought toity never quite clicked into alignment. Mr. skew and Mr. Weber arranged their meetings at the foot of the hill by Bell and flag. The one was Audible, the other visible across the expanse of marshland that separated fort hoity from Fort toity. The bell might not be heard if say, fighter jets on practice runs were screaming across the sky, nor the flag be seen if there was a thick and airy mist of the marshes. That is why Mr. skew and Mr. width between them had devised the system of using both Bell and flag just in case, fighter jets can come screaming across the sky without warning. mist can descend in the blink of an eye on their strolls along the path slowly, gently up the hill, the one carrying an empty pail and the other empty handed. Mr. skew and Mr. Width would babble to each other of the latest doings and frolics and fights and hatreds and recriminations and savageries and vexations and plots and the schemes and geologies and draperies and flaps and twists and couplings and comings and goings at Fort hoity and Fort toity to an outsider such as you or me, it was unremittingly tedious blather have more interest perhaps where the various birds which swooped through the air sometimes it's very close to the heads of Mr. skew and Mr. width as they strolled. Alas, I have mislaid my binder of ornithological resources. Mr. skew was deaf in one ear, and Mr. With blind in one eye. The accident that caused both maimings was the source of their close bond in the Brotherhood of the salt. It happened many years ago, in the last century, during but in no way is related to the Vietnam War. It was a Thursday morning, and by chance Mr. skew and Mr. width, not then known to each other, were in the same field, a field of mon Hey, the one crouching, the other jumping. I have no idea why. And the accident which robbed the one of half his hearing, and the other have half his sight involved a torrential downpour and thunder and lightning and howling winds and a flock of innumerable birds. Without my binder, I cannot be more specific

in their confraternity Mr. skew and Mr. Width made a pact never to speak of what happened in that field. On that wet windy storm racked bird haunted mourn. They went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. We shall leave them there. halfway up the hill, babbling inanities the one to the other and identified birds swooping about their heads, the aide de camp and the goat keeper skew and width far from their forts. The sun is obscured by clouds.

I mentioned that I've mislaid my binder of all mythological resources. I've hunted and searched and rummaged and fossick, high and low in every nook, every cranny, but still haven't found it. So I'd be grateful if you would add a plea for its discovery to your daily prayers, for I fear that without my bird binder, hooting yard itself may simply grind to a halt. Without it whole swathes of the stuff on the website and read on this program could never have been written, never been read. It's a chunky ring binder somewhat battered with age into which a cram the Lifetime's accumulation of paper based bird documentation, notes on nesting habits and flattened swoop patterns, profile depictions of beaks and Bill's feathery prose poems, transcriptions of song and trill and cerpen core and shriek and warble and tweet eggless Talon in printings, brain scans, analysis of millet and tiny semi digested mammals and owl pellets and so on ad avian. In the 1970s, leftist theoreticians coined the phrase actually existing socialism, to account for the fact that communist regimes such as those in Eastern Europe, rather than being the utopia of their dreams were drab gray concrete hellholes. By the same token, my bird binder represents what I like to think of as accurately existing ornithology it's a field in which my expertise is or at least ought to be unquestioned. bereft of my binder, I'm lost, like a blind man's stumbling in fog, in danger of plunging down a crevasse at the bottom of which are piled the bleached and brittle bones of long dead elephant birds and up land mowers and Kangaroo Island, emus and West Coast spotted Kiwis and Korean crested shell ducks and Amsterdam, Ireland ducks and pink headed ducks and reunion pot shards and Auckland, Ireland mergansers and pile builder Mega podes and Vito levels, scrub fouls and Himalayan quails and Javanese lapwings and Tahitian sandpipers and North Ireland Snipes, and Eskimo curlews and great hawks, and Canarian black oyster catchers, and a plethora of rails, the antillean cave, and the Hawkins and the red and the Rodriguez and the barre wing, and the new Caledonian and the white Island and the different barks and the vulva, and the Chatham and the Hawaiian and the ley sand among rails, and ascension, flightless crakes and St. Halina Craig's, and also from St. Halina, st Halina swamp hens, and then Tristan more hens and massacring qute and Colombian grebes and Bermuda night herons and New Zealand little bitterns and reunions sacred ibet is and spectacle, cormorants, and both small and large st Halina petrols and Guadeloupe storm petrels and Chatham Island penguins and Bonin wood pigeons and Ray union, pink pigeons and Rodriguez turtle doves and Sulu bleeding hearts and Norfolk Island, ground doves and thick build ground doves and red moustache, fruit doves and Mauritius blue pigeons and dodos and society parakeet and paradise parrots and oceanic eclectus parrot, a Newton's parakeet and glaucous mammals and Martinique, Amazons, and dead lands, coolers, and st Halina cuckoos and Guadalupe Cara Kara's and reunion kestrels and Mauritius owls and new Caledonian boo box and laughing owls and Puerto Rican barn owls and Jamaican pour rocks and coppery thumb tails and braces emeralds and bog Asana.

Therein lies the beauty the dazzling beauty of actually existing ornithology.

One, the result of losing or mislaying my bird binder was that I had a sort of mental collapse and made an appointment to see a psycho therapist. And since my appointment last week, I've been making strenuous efforts to get in touch with my inner glove compartment. To be honest, I didn't even know I had one. The psycho therapist, however, was quite sure. Her view was that only by allowing light in a glove compartment free rein could I find happiness, or if not happiness, at least a measure of contentment with my lot. When I objected that not being a car owner, I didn't actually have an outer glove compartment. She just waved her hand dismissively and said our session had come to an end. Anyway, the first step, I suppose as I made my way home, was to visualize my inner glove compartment. I found this immensely difficult to do, not having an outer one to picture in my mind's eye. I thought about various cars i'd sat in as a passenger, and tried to summon up their glove compartment, but to no avail. This led me to question the pertinence of the psycho therapists advice, but I had a whole week to get through before I saw her again, during which time I might suffer a complete mental collapse. If I did not do as I was bid. Were I to dry myself in the air of crime. As Arthur Rambo once recommended, I could have stolen a car and claimed it as my own, and that's gained possession of a glove compartment. But I astrue criminality in all its forms, and I've never learned to drive. So that particular Avenue was not open to me. What I did when I got home, was to sit down at my metal Tapping Machine and send messages to everyone I knew who owned the car, asking him asking them to furnish me with details of it glove compartment, the replied came in over the next couple of days. And from the details afforded to me, I built up a mental picture of a sort of a glove compartment. I next tried to imagine this being lodged inside me, in my brain or my stomach or my soul. The psycho therapist had not been specific about its location. I thought I was getting on quite well and was certainly showing no signs of delirium or derangement or be discontent. Then I happened to mention the business to a colleague who suggested that it was perhaps the contents of the inner glove compartment, the stuff I had crammed into it with which I needed to get in touch. This was a revelation which necessitated a further round of metal Tapping Machine messages. From the responses I received, I was able to draw up a lengthy list of items. Granted, this was a list of the things my car owning acquaintances kept in their actual glove compartment, rather than the contents of my own inner one. But it gave me something to work with, and work I did, by mental cogs, whirring away, greased and thrumming. I was incapable, however, of reaching any sensible conclusions. I had a pretty good idea of the general shape and capacity of my inner glove compartment, and I'd filled it with a Higgledy Piggledy collection of gubbins drawn from a dictionary of correspondences between the physical and psychical realms by blockman. Thus, for example, a spare set of car keys in the real world corresponded to a spare set of so called spiritual transportation hypno vehicle keys in the kingdom of the mind, and discarded toffee apple wrapper signified a discarded mental wrapping, a bit sticky and decisively crumpled. This was all very well, but what does it mean? It wasn't my stuff after all, but the ethereal correspondence of my acquaintances stuff. It dawned on me that in order to get in touch with my inner glove compartment, I was going to have to have my own real solid physical glove compartment after all, then I could shove various bitty Bobs into it, remove them, lay them out neatly on the kitchen table, and check each one against its corresponding item in botsman.

I couldn't afford to buy a car, which in any case would be of no use to me. But perhaps I could pick up a secondhand glove compartment salvaged from a prank and crashed crashed machine. But where would I put it? Presumably a glove compartment would have to be inserted into a host of some kind to truly count as a glove compartment. Otherwise, it might as well be an old shoe box or a carton. How much easier things would be if my psycho therapist told me to get in touch with my inner shoe box. The more I thought about my inner shoe box, the more it appealed to me. Indeed, I was quite convinced that I was already in touch with it. With an intensity my psycho therapist would surely approve of I that's consigned my inner glove compartment to oblivion, and dallied with it no more. That's probably why before my next appointment, I suffered a complete mental collapse, and was carted off to a grim, bleak institution perched on a wild and windswept hillside. from my window, I look out upon a major arterial thoroughfare along which in both directions, cars zoom by each one I know has its own glove compartment crammed with stuff, stuff of which I can but dream.

You'll need pens and paper for this next bit, because I'm going to read to you some of these a series of questions for daily reflection. And this is from the self searcher by Hill Edwards. I think published in the 1950s. What you basically need to do is write down these questions and then daily, probably speaking aloud to your reflection in the mirror. Ask yourself these questions. And of course answer them. Do I know what my colors are? Do I make my vowels sing? Am I direct, sincere and simple? Do I know the proper way to sit in and rise from a chair? Am I lovable? Am I original? Am I valiant Have I made a leap Go will. Do I know where it is? Do I hang up my clothes as soon as I take them off? Do I so a snap fastener onto each end of a piece of tape about an inch and a half long. And so these tapes in the center of all shoulder seams, am I so poised so on my center so innately joyous, that life cannot sway me this way or that. So I'm sure that if you ask yourself those questions each day, and of course, answer them each day. The self searcher, you will be a much better person than the one you are now. I'm going to end this week's show with a request. I had a request from out of Spaceman to read a passage from Shakespeare. So I don't want any complaints from any old Thespians who are listening. This is a bit of Shakespeare from troilus and Cressida and its cities speaking. This is as requested by our Spaceman. By the way apart from very well, there is something other than hooting yard on the internet. There's the inexplicable world of outer space man, a splendid website with much cardboard. I do recommend you go and see it. So anyway, this is for him. Why his masculine whore. Now the rotten diseases of the South, the guts griping ruptures Qatar's loads of gravel in the back, left argies cold poles these raw eyes dirty rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of impulse fume, Skye Africa's line kills a palm, incurable boat ache and the reveled the simple of the teta, take and take again such preposterous discoveries.

Frank Key  27:12
That was William Shakespeare, from troilus and Cressida, this has been hooting out on the air with me Frank key, don't forget to visit the website. Don't forget to send me some money. Because, you know, that always helps. And I'll be back next week with more exciting stuff. But I'm gonna keep talking now because I think we have a technical hitch. And so whereas I was going to shut up, I'm gonna babble in namely, no doubt, until such time as the technical hitch can be resolved with great Erlang and expertise by john, who is going to sort it all out, even as we speak. And I'm waiting for some kind of signal from him, but he's still looking very, very pensive and expert like, and so I'm just gonna keep babbling. This is like an additional hooting yard bonus. And if that's not worth a quarter of your money, I don't know what is. So go to hooting yard and click on the Pay Pal Donate button. I always ask this and sometimes people actually respond, but not always. I'm gonna keep talking. Oh, I can now shut up. Bye bye.
