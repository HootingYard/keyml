Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frankie and this is hooting yard on the air. It's nice to know that some things never change. So, as usual, I'm kind of coffee, and so I might have a coughing fit during the show in April, that will be the ninth anniversary of the hooting yard on the air. Which is quite a remarkable feat. Anyway, over over on the hooting, yell blog, hooting yard.org. What I've been doing this year is writing or not writing, transcribing diary extracts from various people each day. And I thought what I'd see if I could do this here on the show is is read those diary entries. We'll see how it goes. But that's what this week's show is going to be the first one of 2013 and we begin with Dobson's diary for the first of January 1953. Dobson the out of print pamphleteer was an intermittent diarist. At certain periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal. Other times, he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings and there are also whole stretches when he fell completely silent, at least as a diarist. Surprisingly, there has been as yet another attempt to marshal all the extant texts into a published edition. But anyway, here is his diary entry written 60 years ago, on the first of January 1953. Carry cabbage stalks in swans blood for breakfast. Then I went for a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal stopped to gaze at cows, the cows gazed back, spent untold hours slumped at my escrito are struggling with my pamphlet in progress, farming with knowns. The problem is I know little about farming, and even less about knowns. Why then asked my enamorado marigolds to did I choose the topic in the first place. She fails to grasp the intricate workings of what I have decided to dub Dobson practice, a practice that may itself be the subject of a future pamphlet. When the time came to sharpen my pencil, I could not find the pencil sharpener. So instead, I picked up this week's copy of the listener and read a fascinating article about a buff breasted Sandpiper. From a careful reading and rereading. I deduce that this is some sort of bird by what it's doing hanging around at a sewage work is beyond me. If I had wings and the power of flight, I am by no means certain that I would choose to wallow in sewage. When I could take wing and fly to Oh, I don't know, somewhere less noise some a noxious Actually, I know that the writer calls it a sewage farm rather than a sewage works. Perhaps this is a suitable type of farm for knowns. I shall have to embark upon further research pig and peas for supper.

Frank Key  04:37
The next day we find Dobson worrying away at the same subject. This is his diary for the second of January 1953. I embarked on my research into sewage farm gnomes by rereading and rereading the article in the listener About a buff breasted Sandpiper. It was a pity I thought that no illustration accompany the piece. Elsewhere in the same issue, the editor had found room for a picture of masks in an article about masks. This exasperated me so much thought I threw my new pencil sharpener bought this morning to replace the one mislaid yesterday out of the window and into a puddle. Why on earth the window was wide open on a day as inclement as this is a surpassing mystery, or it would be had marigold cool not embraced some harebrained fresh air fad. I hope you soon divert our attention to something less chilly and windswept. Anyway, it seems quite obvious to me that everybody knows what a Basque is, and we don't need a photograph to aid our understanding. Whereas I doubt there are many persons with the Vegas clue about buff breasted sandpipers, a picture would have helped. I was going to fire off a stern letter packed with invective to the editor of the listener, but having tracked my pencil sharpener out of the window, and my pencil being ruinously blunt, and there being no spare pencils to be found anywhere, I was at a loss. And in any case, leafing through the listener to locate the wholly unnecessary picture of a mask, so I could refer to the page number in my irate letter, I happened upon the piece about a buff breasted Sandpiper again and paused to re re re read it for the umpteenth time. And it was then I was struck by a previously overlooked detail. The author r s are fitter begins his piece, I found myself at a large sewage farm, a large sewage farm. Now, though, I know very little about knowns, I do know that they're small or reputed to be small, or small knowns be likely to farm a large sewage farm. I thought it more likely that names would be found at a small sewage farm, one of the sides appropriate to their smallness. Thus, even at this very early stage, I was making progress in my research for my conclusion seemed in arguable. As a stroke. I had whittled down the number of sewage farms that which gnomes might be found, are resolved to obtain a map and a thick black marker pen with which to expand all large and medium sized sewage farms from the map, leaving only the smaller ones visible. That should keep me gainfully employed for a while at least, I have high hopes for the pamphlet, which will eventually result. Another thing I need to do when I have the means to sharpen my pencil and that's to write a letter is to send a query to our s are fitter care of the listener. I'm intrigued by the beginning of that phrase I found myself at it is as if Mr. fitta woke from a deep sleep, or perhaps a trance or a coma, and found himself at the sewage farm, as opposed to where he might have expected to be home for example, or in a familiar snack bar. I want to ask him if this is a regular occurrence, and if there are any other places he has found himself, other types of farm, other suid related locations, or indeed anywhere else on God's Earth. The year of our Lord MC M. l II has certainly begun with some fascinating lines of inquiry, who knows what more lies in store decontaminant decontaminant decontaminated plovers eggs for breakfast.

Frank Key  09:33
And that's not the last mention of plovers in this week show for all you order for logically minded hooting yars listeners. For the third of January, I picked the diary of Alma Schindler. And what she wrote in her diary in on the third of January 1902, which was two months before she married Good stuff. Marla four. Yes, Alma Schindler is better known to posterity as Alma mala, and on the third of January 1902, she wrote in her diary, bliss, and rapture.

Frank Key  10:43
Lucky Alma Marla I will Alma Schindler as she was fourth of January 1934. Tiny Enid diary, milk slops for breakfast washed down with gin. Read a fascinating article in the Ipsy Dixie do about Mussolini dooj in faraway Italy. Having thoroughly digested it, I decided to set off for the railway station to make the trains run on time. This is precisely the sort of activity a plucky, taught such as myself ought to be engaged in. On my way to the station I encountered a tearaway pulling the wings off flies. I kicked his headed, and then made him glue the wings back on using a glue composed of his own blood spittle and bone marrow. Then I made him swear a solemn vow to be an upstanding citizen for the rest of his natural life. It is a shame such ne'er do wells can no longer be transported to Botany Bay. Thinking of Botany Bay made me think of botany. So I paused by the railway embankment to pick some peonies and marigold. Because of my deeds of derring do and polish on for violence. People often forget that I'm just a simple little girly, and take great pleasure in my flower press. Sometimes, I fancy I hear the flowers shrieking as I press every last majan of life out of them. At the railway station, the dithering old station master Mr. Cribbins was faffing about with a flag and a hooter. Needless to say he cannot make the trains run on time. I lured him to some sidings by pretending my little dolly was trapped in the rails, then buried him up to his neck in coarse sand. I read him the riot act, or at least a version of it, improvised by his DJ translated into English by my mysterious mentor. Back on the platform, I took up Mr. Cribbins, his flag and hooter and deployed them in such a manner that I struck fear into the hearts of crane drivers throughout the land. It was a good mornings work. The trains ran on time. Later, I cut a picture of Mussolini out of the Ipsy Dixie do

Frank Key  13:45
and then we go back to Dobson. his diaries contain a huge number of undated entries. Over the past several years, a team of indefatigable researchers has been busy attempting to pinpoint specific dates where possible. In a project funded by an unfathomably secret organization, possibly led by international woman of mystery Primrose dent the team his most recent success was to juice from internal textual evidence that the following was written on the fifth of January 1958.

Frank Key  14:32
After a breakfast of kippers, harebrained and jellied celery, I was all set to spend the day slumped at my escrow. tois scribbling, but by in our merata marigold to had other ideas. We must go on an outing, she cried frighteningly. When I asked why, she replied that we ought to celebrate by outing and picnic. The birthday Have scarlatti zebby along pike Frederick Converse, Herbert Beyonce woke, Eve tanky Stella Gibbons vielen Wagner, freidrich Duren, Matt WD Snodgrass, Walter Mondale, Umberto Eco rise a goober trover, Jan Leeming, Diane Keaton, Linda Claire, and Joan Bella wager, while also commemorating the anniversary of the death of Edward the Confessor, Catherine did muddy Creek, call Alfred von zytel. So Ernest Shackleton, Amy Johnson, Charles Slee, and misting get when I said I had no idea who some of these people were, she announced that today was also the anniversary of the Great Fire of Eindhoven, the discovery of X rays and the foundation of the Nazi Party. So let us pack our picnic hamper and set off on a hike she added. Which is what we did after the picnic, cows rain. We stopped in at the Museum of act on or near the valg it was about to close due to the pomposity of the curator, but we had a few minutes in which to look around. My eye was caught by an exhibit of indescribable gorgeousness Well, I say indescribable, but the pompous curator made a pretty good Fist of describing it on the card placed next to it, which I copied out in my dropping pad with my propelling pencil. So I quote it is 45 centimeters in height, has a jewel encrusted crumpling base, ivory fluting Ruth silk and the belt hectic trimmings, a delightful milky green ribbed spandrel villainous scraping marks a gutta percha rim, opalescent by some head motifs. swiveling glutinous beads inlaid with serried gems, Fleur de Li hatching, precise web and tuck defrayment talc stippled A riband nightside opening on the velvetine casing.

But as we left the museum, a jack door swooped out of the sky, and snatched that page of the jata in its beak, and flew away our way up into the overcast sky

Frank Key  18:22
back to January 1953. Now, but not to Dobson, rather to Kenneth Williams, on the sixth of January 1953. how impossible it is for me to make regular entries in the diary. I suddenly remember how I used to puzzle over the word at school, always wondering why diary was so like dairy, and what the connection was never found out. Like that label on the bottle of daddy sauce. It never stopped. The man on the label was holding a bottle of daddy sauce. And on the label was a man holding a bottle of daddy source, ad infinitum ad nauseum for me at any rate. And listeners may recall with listeners with very good memories may recall that Franz Kafka was also the subject to dairy diary, befuddlement, or at least the manufacturers of Postcards in his memory was so befuddled, I have a postcard bought in Prague in 1992, which on the back has a quotation from the dairies of Franz Kafka. And there should have been a pause there, but I kind of didn't work that out with john the engineer, so I'm just going to carry on because I didn't wave at him in a kind of a feat manner, which is what I normally do. So we'll move on to the seventh of January 1966 in this case, and this is an extract from the diary of the lumbering walrus moustached psychopathic serial killer babinski woke up feeling murderous. preened, my moustache and sharpened by x and cleaver and slicer, tossed them into a gunny sack, slung it over my shoulder and went out on a rampage. The sky was blue birds were singing, and the municipal flower bed here about was splurged with glory, plastic glory at being the depths of winter, but glory nonetheless. I am no Panglossian Far from it. But even I was persuaded that this might indeed be the best of all possible worlds. In fact, I felt so chipper that when a beggar person approached me, is grumpy with a poor, outstretched arms, I pressed a penny upon him and wished him all the best. It's all for God broke into a toothless grin that warmed my cockles. Further down the street. Several puppies were frolicking, I struck the fear of the dog God into them, and they scampered away. Above in the blue sky. a trio of cranes flew by and I thought of Sibelius. He was a born the man with a drink problem, but he knew how to write a symphony. I thought about popping into a finished church to say a prayer for his immortal soul, and I stopped a passer by to ask if there were any finished churches in this neighborhood. Once I might have overlooked I've only been here for a couple of days after fleeing the couple's following that gore splattered business over by pointy town Town Hall. The coppers here have not noticed my presence yet, except for one particularly inquisitive and irritating constable who demanded to see my library ticket. I smoked him as if we were living in Old Testament times. And then I smoked him again and again. And when he was thrice Smith nice flew him with a flaming sword. setting fire to was sort of easier said than done, but I recently came across some kind of flammable jelly. Smear that liberally on your sword and Strike a match. And hey, presto. The pastor by was ignorant of any finished churches, but he told me where I might find a guidebook to the local communities. He was so helpful that I spared his life, just having a few little chops acting with my cleaver, nothing but emergency paramedics and a well equipped air ambulance won't be able to patch up. The guidebook I found as promised in the news agents kiosk did not list a single Finnish church. What kind of baileywick was this? humming a few snatches from Sibelius is majestic six Symphony. I smashed the key off to firewood with my axe, and then set off in pursuit of the newsagent who would run off screaming into the hills.

Frank Key  23:21
I soon caught up and slaughtered him. And it was such a lovely spot up there in the hills. Despite the cold that I snacked on his brains and liver and light before going back into town for a bit more rampaging. But in the meantime, the cup as it arrived, headed by that relentless detective, Captain kargh pan, my nemesis, so I had to go into hiding. I'm currently cooped up in a hot at the waterworks. Tomorrow, I will have to create a diversion and make my escape. It's a pity I've run out of flammable jelly.

Frank Key  24:42
Very briefly, we can end this week's show with a diary for the eighth of January 1939. And this is from George Orwell's diary. It's the complete and unabridged entry for that date. Some of you will know what to expect. George Orwell's diary, eighth of January 1939. Complete and unabridged.

Unknown Speaker  25:13
three eggs.

Frank Key  25:18
And I'll be back next week with more diaries and maybe some other stuff if we have time. There might even be more from George Orwell's diary. Who knows? I did say I was gonna mention plovers again. But I haven't got time. So maybe Martin mentioned clovers. Next week

Unknown Speaker  25:39
Popeye. Hello again.

Frank Key  25:53
JOHN has just pointed out that My watch is wrong. And I've still got another five minutes. So while for he now tells me so I'm sorry about that. I hope you didn't switch off as soon as I said goodbye, but he wouldn't have done that. So we can go on we can go on with with the plovers the ninth of January. With the following day, George Orwell actually had more to say. He did mention that there were two eggs as opposed to three. But he didn't leave it at that he verbose or what he carried on writing. And what he wrote

Unknown Speaker  26:41
was

Frank Key  26:43
so a large flock of green plover apparently the same as in England. Now, I found that a bit puzzling. I mean, why would plovers be different in a different country? a plumber is a plumber. I mean, did all well think foreign plumbers would somehow differ from clean, decent English plumbers?

Unknown Speaker  27:06
Maybe he did.

Frank Key  27:12
That I think that will be the end of the show now, because I can't really begin with the next diary entry, which is from the ninth of January and is the diary of fictional athletes bobbing it to Vol. One of the very few fictional athlete to have kept an entirely non fictional diary, though, quite how it came to be written is anybody's guess. So we will begin next week.

Unknown Speaker  27:44
Excuse me.

Frank Key  27:47
We will begin next week with Bob Lutz to Vols diary for the ninth of January. That's followed by a peasant diary for the 10th of January, a peasant writing a diary on the 10th of January 49 BC. Anyway, so that's it. I hope you've enjoyed this special Well, in my head is a specially extended edition. But that's probably because my watch was wrong, or slow or fast or whatever it was. I am now babbling so I will shut up and wish you all the best for the week ahead.

Unknown Speaker  28:30
And

Frank Key  28:34
that's it I think, yeah. Bye bye.
