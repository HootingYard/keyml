For a long time I used to go to bed early, I was exhausted from long days working as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. There are those who think that being a janitor is an easy life, little more than a matter of rattling a set of keys sloshing a mop along a curried or floor and glaring reproachfully at all who passed by. There may be janitors of that kidney, but I was not that kind of janitor. I never had been neither in this nor in any of my earlier janitor ships. It's a curious fact that the buildings in which I have been a janitor have all housed milk related activities. Before being appointed to my post in the evaporated milk factory, I worked at a condensed milk canning plant and milk of magnesia Research Laboratory, and then milks slops, and milk slops slippage tank. When I was younger, I lacked application and was frequently reprimanded on a carpet, as is usually the case by my superiors. The overseer of the slippage tank was particularly rancorous as I recall. But by the time I fetched up at the evaporated milk factory, I took my duties seriously, excessively so and that was why I was exhausted at the end of the day. To be precise, I was exhausted before the end of the day, hence my going to bed early. There is a pamphlet by Dobson entitled tips for janitors out of print, which helped to mend my ways. One boiling hot summer Sunday at a loose end, I went to visit a dying janitor in a Mercy Home. his brow was beetle and his lower jaw was lanten and he was slowly perishing from a malady which had set in after an attack of the bindings, and which he could not shake off due to his advanced age. It was not entirely clear just how old he was, for his birth certificate had been destroyed by worms. He certainly looked unbelievably ancient when I went to see him on that boiling day, propped up in a sort of collapsible medical chair surrounded by dripping foliage like general stern wood in the Big Sleep. He had made a vain attempt to mask his decrepitude by dyeing his hair black with boot polish, and by sporting the type of T shirt worn by young Japanese trendies. Neither ploy for me. I knew I was looking at a janitor who had began his career in the age of gas, mantle's and steam. My visit was prompted by a plea from the charitable board for janitors close to death, seeking volunteers to pay social calls on janitors close to death to brighten their last days. I thought myself to lagu breus to be suitable for such a good deed. But the board's director, an ex flapper by the name of Mimsy henbane, said that this particular dying janitor rejoiced in the lagu breus and few nariyal and bleak and that my presence would lift his spirits like the Italian castrato opera singer, Luigi marquese 1754 to 1829, who, irrespective of the part he was playing, insisted on making his stage entrances on horseback wearing a helmet with white feathers several feet long. I'd like to cut something of a dash when entering a Mercy Home. On this particular Sunday, I was in smothered in fine kingley rayment complete with the pelt of a Wolverine gulo gulo, the largest land dwelling member of the weasel family, a burnished golden helmet marquese would have died four and a bobble or two. It was stiflingly hot, of course, but my blood is ice cold and I had achieved a temperate, equitable Abram as I strode majestically into the greenhouse, where in the dying janitor awaited me. Unable to tell you his name, not because I do not know it but because I found it completely unpronounceable. He was a tan Tara been parentage, and bought one of those impossible and I must say foolish names they're so fond of in that land. He was also wearing a pair of dentures which had been designed for a mouth much larger than his. So it was not only his name I failed to catch. I had brought with me as a gift a bag of extra crunchy hard crunchy trouble crackers, and it looked to me as if those gigantic teeth will be more than a match for their crunchiness indeed, they were for a

few minutes as the dying janitor shoveled the crackers gratefully into his gob. It was like being in a hot, damp greenhouse with a snapping turtle. He crunched his way through the whole bag full so rapidly, that I wonder if he was ever fed. I haven't seen any staff in the Mersey home not even a janitor. In fact, I haven't seen any other patients. There were some pigs in a sty between the greenhouse and the main building, but otherwise the place seemed deserted.

One of the things I've always liked about people from tan tower been is that they're so easy to rub along with. After he scoffed his crackers, the dying janitor sat there smiling weekly, but I suppose to contentedly while I moved above him lugubrious and few nariyal and bleak, just as Mimsy henbane had suggested. I decided to stay until his smile faded, and propped myself against a pane of glass. Having first twisted the dying janitors neck round slightly, so I was still within his sight. It felt good to be doing something selfless for one who had trodden the path of janitor done before me. I pondered if this was what being a Boy Scout was all about. My only connection with the toggle tribe had been a single incident in the year of the Tet Offensive when I failed to stop a snack bar hooligan pushing a puny Boy Scout into a lake and would have intervened, but I was preoccupied at the time with recalibrating a mechanism. One of my leisure pursuits in the days when I was an England janitor, rather than the indefatigable one. I became at the evaporated milk factory when I no longer had time nor energy for leisure pursuits of any kind. Despite his penis, the boy scout had passable swimming skills, and he managed to avoid drowning in the lake, a lake in which many had met a watery death. I knew this because their names were inscribed on a plaque affixed to a post at the edge of the lake, and I had bashed the post into the mud myself with a hammer one day many years before when I had nothing else to do. I used to roam the lakes and ponds and there abouts with my hammer, looking for posts to bash into the muck. If I couldn't find any posts, I became disconsolate and squatted on the nearest available tasik sobbing until it was time to wend my way home. I had plenty of time to dwell upon my past as I leaned against the pane of glass in the greenhouse for the dying janitors smile never wavered. It seemed that he was so pleased with the crackers and with my lagu breus presence, that he had entered a state of transcendent bliss. I was determined, however, to keep to my plan of staying with him until he was no longer smiling. I knew Mimsy henbane would approve, and in a sense it was also a way of a swaging the guilt I still felt about failing to prevent the snack bar hooligan shoving that puny Boy Scout into the lake. that had happened many years before, as I've indicated, but as time passed, my conscience gnawed at me with ever increasing ferocity. In those days, far from going to bed early. Often I never went to bed at all. Instead, marching up and down countryside lanes all night incapable of sleep. I was keeping the same hours as owls and if nothing else, that fraught Insomniac period helped me to extend my ornithological education. If I was a pamphleteer like Dobson, rather than a janitor, I'm sure I could churn out in numerable essays on owls and other nocturnal birds, as it is, I like Dubai. buttonholing, the occasional evaporated milk factory employee and sharing my bird learning with them whether they like it or not. It was a pity that the dying janitor was from tan Tara beam and wearing dentures far too big for his mouth, and thus would have been unintelligible to me where he to be prodded into speech, for there was something in his demeanor which told me that he, like me was an erudite janitor. I couldn't guess what his area of expertise was, of course, so I made a mental note to ask Mimsy henbane when next I called into the charitable board for cloud janitors close to death HQ Mimsy his journey from flapper to charitable board director was an extraordinary one. Her story has inspired poets, novelists, composers, filmmakers, and creative Titans in just about any field you can think of. Not least the designers of T shirts worn by young Japanese trendies. Dennis beer pint wrote a series of

Frank Key  10:49
cantos about her. Anthony Burgess struggled for years with a novel based on her life, but was forced to abandon it when he concluded that such a work was beyond his imaginative powers. And opera booth by Booth was inspired by her. Dan Brown is apparently working on a potboiler called the Mimsy henbane code. Before his untimely death, Raina van Fassbinder planned a film about her set in a tough foreign dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. The list goes on. Yet intriguingly, not one of the works based on her life ever addressed the root cause of her devotion to janitors close to death. There is always plenty about her flat boyhood and about the Antarctic Expedition, the beekeeping the shipwreck, the surgical interventions, the gladsome spring on the buffets of autumn, the postage stamp mystery, the years of crime, the gutter poetry interlude, the bittersweet romances, the collapsed lung, the other collapsed lung, the delicate little fists beating hopelessly against wooden panels in the heart in the forest, the evil chickens, the Gordy boo duar, the Karen Carpenter incident, the vandalism, the scuba diving, the pitfalls, the obelisk, the gravel pathways, the euphonium band, The pint of milk, and the gruesome business in the tough foreign dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. Yet of janitors dying or otherwise, not one word. I know because I've checked before I started working myself to exhaustion in the evaporated milk factory, I was able to spend some of my leisure time making a thorough study of all the Mimsy henbane related books and films and plays and Opera booths and trendy Japanese t shirts, etc. From beer pint to Burgess from booth to Brown, no creative Titan deems janitors worthy of a mention. I try not to take this personally and deny that I've poked pins into miniature wax effigies of any of those named or of any others such as Harrison Birtwistle and sound man Rushdie and the paperback is pebble head during spooky midnight ceremonies where I've been joined by jabbering chanting who did blood soaked, wild eyed, whirling, drooling, drugged up maniacs. In any case, whatever lagu breus dismay I may feel towards those who have ignored my profession is more than outweighed by the fact that Mimsy henbane herself devoted her latter years to my kind. And she did so selflessly. Apart from the excessive fees she charged to those lucky enough to find a haven in one of her mercy homes, or in one of the greenhouses next to the pigsty is in one of her mercy homes, and the extra charges she levied on the relics of those janitors who dying died and passed into the realm of which we know not. So despite my hours of study, I'm as clueless as the next janitor as to Mindy's motives. All I know is that she fully deserves my gratitude, and that's why I stood leaning against a pane of glass in that greenhouse, while a dying janitor propped up in a collapsible medical chair. His hair slathered in boot polish, and his dentures too big for his mouth, smiled at me for three whole days. I did it for mimsey.

I think what the smile off his face at last was that he felt pangs of hunger for more crackers. he mumbled something at me in that weird impossible tan tarbet Maxim and pointed a bony finger the empty cracker bag he dropped onto the floor. I told him that I would go to old mar purgatives clifftop superstore a lengthy hike away to get another bag full wondered if he would still be alive when I returned. As I turned to sweep out of the greenhouses dramatically as I had entered, in my kingly Raymond, he rummaged in a little wooden cupboard next to his chair, took out the Dobson pamphlet tips for janitors and pressed it into my greedily outstretched hands. Over the next few days, as I made my slowly goobers few nariyal bleak way towards the coast and the clifftop, I stopped from time to time to sprawl on bright summertime lawns, and I read the out of print pamphlet from cover to cover. When I'd finished it, I started again from the beginning. I was thunderstruck, in spite of my various milk related janitorial posts, I felt I was reading about an entirely new and different calling, one of which I was profoundly ignorant. Between them, the dying janitor and Mimsy, henbane and Dobson changed my life. Eager as I was to become a reborn janitor at the earliest opportunity. I was mindful of my promise to the dying janitor in the greenhouse next to the pigsty. I had made him so happy with that bag of extra crunchy, hard crunchy herbal crackers, and had vowed to fetch them another bag torn between duty and desire. I spent a miserable morning sobbing on a tasik then fortune smiled upon me, just as the dying janitor had done by sending into my path a Boy Scout, as puny as the one who years before I had seen pushed into a lake by a snack bar hooligan. The child appeared at the side of my tasik and inquired if I had a job for him to do in exchange for a shilling. I took his coinage and sent him off towards old mar purgatives clifftop superstore, having armed him with full instructions on a map, and his shilling back to pay for the crackers. Then I turned my face towards pointy town, and headed for the evaporated milk factory, and a new life.

This is the first of two stories about beppo but they're different babos as will become clear. beppo was banished to a pompous land where he knew nobody at the docks under Klieg lights for they disembark from the boat in the middle of the night. His trains were taken off by the skipper himself masing babos filthy hare. The Skipper reminded him that he was now in a land of much pomposity and forbidden to leave it for 40 years. beppo little pump at the docks, he saw crates and stevedores and container ships and much else one might expect to see at docks in any land, never having hung around any docks before now beppo was smitten by the novelty of the sights and sounds and smells, and he stayed put. He sat for hours on a bench on the docks, watching ships and sailors and crates. He begged for bloaters from the cruise of smacks which brought their catch to the docks. He found shelter under a neglected tarpaulin and rubbed undulant into those parts of his flesh, where they're trained to chafed it. The gawked at floozies roaming the docks in their satins and silks, a floozy with a cloth hat befriended him and talked of the pomposity of the Land Beyond the docks. After 100 days at the docks beppo nerved himself to leave. His cloth hatted friend convinced him to go to the capital city, where majestic buildings scrape the sky and the blades of helicopters word and the paving slabs along the boulevards were free of grime and grease. But she forgot to tell him about the pumpers centuries at the city gates, whose lips curled in sneers at babos approach. Bebo explained that he'd been banished from his own land, and that he'd come to the capital city to get work piloting a helicopter. His plan, which he did not divulge to the pompous centuries, was to become fat and to grow a mustache, and to pilot a helicopter back to his own land, where he hoped his new fat mustachioed appearance would deceive his banishes the centuries chuckled, pompously And marched beppo off to an area of disused Railway Infrastructure where they tied him to the rails. They got this idea from watching a number of silent film serials, starring Paul white 1889 to 1938, including the perils of pulling the exploits of a lane, the iron claw, the fatal ring, the house of hate, and plunder. The centuries overlook the fact that the railway being disused, no locomotive would come hurtling towards trap beppo as he struggled with the chords that bound him. The centuries not tying skills Well, the mental and beppo managed to free himself within minutes. Then he wandered off along the disused railway track skirting the capital city. He hoped to find a spot where he might breach the massive granite wall, a spot without centuries and where a certain amount of crumble meant had occurred. Alas, when beppo found such a spot, he discovered that it was used as a conduit by feral zombie like rough Ian's these creatures had once been full citizens of the capital city, but had been shunned due to their lack of pomposity. They now lived in a twilight world staging raids into the cities through the crumbling zone, and setting upon passing wayfarers out with the wall such as beppo. They shared the hair off his head and sprinkled the cuttings onto the soup in their Billy cans. They made him wear a foolish hat, like poked at him with pointed sticks and drew upon him. His humiliations ceased at nightfall, when search lights from a patrolling helicopter picked out the rough Ian's and made them flee. The helicopter landed in an adjoining field, and beppo was bundled aboard the flight to the helipad in the pumpers capital city was a short one, but halfway there, the helicopter was engulfed in thick, thick fog fog so thick that visibility was zero. On the 15th of December 1944, Glenn Miller took off in an airplane from rHf twin wood farm in Bedfordshire on route to Paris. The aeroplane and the bandleader vanished without trace over the English Channel beppo better similar, in explicable fate.

the time being what it is, I'm going to keep the other bedpost story for next week, because it's very short, and then we'll kind of come to a too early an end, so instead, I'm going to read you something else to take us up to the end of the show. All around my hat is an English folk song popularized in the 1970s by folk rock Titans steeleye span. Their version was very similar to the one published in a garland of country song by se bine baring Gould in 1895. Apart from folk song and folklore collections, bearing gold wrote, hymns are 16 volume lives of the saints, many novels, a study of werewolves, grave desecration and cannibalism, and a biography of Robert Stephen Hawker 1803 to 1875. The eccentric country Vicar, who spent much of his time smoking opium in a clifftop hot made from driftwood, talked to birds, dressed up as a mermaid, excommunicated his cat and had a pet pig. All around my hat are also the opening words of one of Dobson's more curious pamphlets in which he described wearing a hat lined with led to deflect weird invisible rays aimed at his brain. It's not clear who or what is sending these putative rays, nor why the dog sonian cranium needs to be protected from them. Or around my hat writes the pamphleteer The air is a site of constant barrage from weird invisible brain rays that end with an exclamation Mark, an uncharacteristic touch which has convinced some critics that Dobson was fooling around. The idea that this pamphlet is an unserious blotch on the Canon has gained ground in recent years, with nesting bird for one, going so far as to claim that Dobson did not even write it, but simply copy that random paragraph from a booklet given away as a free gift with a packet of breakfast cereal. This argument loses a certain force when nesting bird has to admit that he hasn't managed to identify the said booklet nor the breakfast cereal. In any case, as upstart young Dobson is Ted cat has pointed out in a series of increasingly aggressive letters. Dobson usually ate bloaters for breakfast. The nesting bird CAC correspondence is a perfect example of the way in which the minutiae of Dobson studied can be magnified to the point where common sense is blotted out. Much as the bulk of a pig the size of Robert Stephen hawkers, pet pig would blot out the sun. If you were sprawled in a particular patch of muck in its die. It was a very large pig. Thus, the senior critic floats the idea of the breakfast cereal booklet. The upstart counters with the point about bloaters the elder counters that the packet of breakfast cereal may have been purchased by a munched by marigold to the youngster replies with a computerized database of known breakfast cereal free gift booklets for the period in question. The old man picks out flaws in the research. The rookie lets loose a vituperative attack on his opponents atrophy brain sinews, and before long, the columns of a reputable literary journal read like the ravings of HP Lovecraft and his more hysterical passages. All of this can be great fun for those entertained by Dobson related Pap, but sober minded scholars are I think Ill served. There's a great temptation to take both nesting burden Ted Kak by the scruff of their necks and crack their heads together. hairline fractures in the skulls of both might just allow in thin shafts of light akin to the weird invisible rays Dobson feared might be beaming towards his own brain, or I should say, the weird invisible rays Dobson possibly feared, unless, of course, he was just fooling around for reasons which must remain obscure to us. Without wishing to generate further controversy over what is in any case, a pointless and trivial matter. I should add that I've recently completed a lengthy work at 15 volumes. Just one book short of Saban bearing goals lives of the saints. It's a comprehensive study with lots of illustrations and diagrams of all Dobson's known and suspected

Robert Stephen Hawker. The eccentric country Vicar mentioned there was a real character real figure, as was st Rumbold. And if like me, you're unreasonably obsessed with the weird goings on in the Anglican Church. You might have discovered the blog that's being done by Bishop dream Robinson. I'm certainly pleased that I stumbled upon it for it taught me about St. Grunwald. St. Ron wold was born at King Sutton in AD 662, the son of St. signer Burger King out fried. His first words on the day he was born where I am a Christian. He then asked to be baptized and to receive Holy Communion. The next day he preached a sermon, quoting freely from Scripture. And on the third day, he addressed another sermon to his parents, and then he keeled over and died. pious infant indeed. That's the end of this week's show. I'll be back next week, there'll be a story about beppo As promised, and much else besides Bye, bye.
