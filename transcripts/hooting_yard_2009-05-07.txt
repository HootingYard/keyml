Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting owl on the air. This week's show will be hotchpotch of various odds and ends on do most of the shows are but anyway, particularly hot Paki this week, and I'd like to begin with reading a letter that was sent to the times from someone called CL s. On the 16th of August 1871. Sir, on Monday last I had the misfortune of taking a trip per steamer to Margate. The sea was rough, the ship crowded, and therefore most of the Cockney excursionists prostrate with seasickness. on landing on Margate Pier, I must confess I thought that instead of landing in an English seaport, I had been transported by magic to wetland inhabited by savages and lunatics. The scenes that ensued when the unhappy passengers have to pass between the double line of a Margate mob on the pier must be seen to be believed possible in a civilized country. shouts yells howls of delight greeted every pale looking passenger, as he or she got on the pier, accompanied by a running comment of the lowest phallus language imaginable. But the most insulted victims were a young lady who having had a bit of hysterics on board had to be assisted up the steps, and a venerable looking old gentleman with a long gray beard, who by the by was not sick at all, but being crippled and very old feebly totted up the slippery steps leaning on two sticks. Here's a guy, hello, your old thief you won't get drowned because you know that you ought to be hung, etc. And worse than that were the greetings of that old poor old man. All this while very much silverbear striped policeman stood calmly by without interfering by word or deed, and myself having several ladies to take care of could do nothing except telling the roughy and Li mob some hard words with of course, no other effect than to draw all the abuse on myself. This is not an exceptional exhibition of Margate, Rafi and ism, but as I have been told, is a daily occurrence only varying in intensity with the roughness of the sea. public exposure is the only likely thing to put a stop to such Rafi anism and now it is no longer a wonder to me why so many people are ashamed of confessing that they have been to Margate

with my Fife and my drum, I wandered in the hills, I tooted my Fife and I banged my drum. This was why I was wandering in the hills for I had been banished from town my tooting and banging our nerve, the good burgers and the bad burgers too. And I was escorted to the town perimeter and shoved across the line. It was an actual line painted in whitewash and regularly repainted wherever it lost integrity through scuffing by boot soles and the like. I was told plainly by way of an edict that I could never again to to my Fife or bang my drum within the town drew to the unnerved mint I caused. I accepted this and wandered up into the hills to toot Bang, bang bang to to bang bang, bang. I was as happy as a sand boy, although I'm not entirely sure what a sandbox is, unless it be a remarkably happy boy made out of wet impacted sand by some beach bound geppetto. I was happy in the hills until I was attacked by a flock of pootie. No one had ever thought to tell me that the sky above the hills was infested by chubby curly locked cherubs from the Italian Renaissance. Some armed with bows and arrows and all blessed with the power of flight whenever I had seeing pictures of them during my lessons. I understood them to be harmless. mischievous, yes, but in a playful way. It came as a shock to me to discover that they were demented and malevolent, never a good combination. They also seem to object to my tooting on my, on my banging on my drum. I took shelter in a recently vacated bivouac. You should always take care in the hills when occupying a vacant bivouac to find out if it has been wholly abandoned, or if the person who built it is drew back shortly. That person might be large and menacing with hairy fists and wild eyes. Many Hill dwellers fit that description. I saw dying embers from a fire and some spat out gristle from a sausage, neither of which told me whether or not I could expect the company. The put he continued to sweep in the sky above ready to renew their attack if they got the chance. I judged that if a large hairy Hill person were to return to claim his bivouac, I could frighten him off with tooting and banging. Such ogres are usually averse to a din. But unless the party flew away, I was trapped. I could only hope that their attentions might be distracted by a passing goat or peasant. I wanted to wonder yet here I was stuck in a bivouac to pass the time I tooted my Fife and banged my drum. About an hour later the maker of the bivouac returned. It was not as I had surmised, a large and ungainly Hill person, but grumpy German film director Horst gak. The putty swooped upon him as he approached the armed ones firing golden arrows at him, but he simply shouted at them and waved his fist as hairy as a hill persons fist and they dispersed with babyish squeaks. I wondered why I had not thought to use ghacks simple tactics. But then the presiding genius of the cinema of belligerence had a guttural shout and an aggressive fist blandishment beyond compare. He was unconcerned that I was occupying his bivouac. Indeed, as soon as he saw my files and my drum, he questioned me closely about them. He was a very intense man as you might expect, as he fried sausages over the rekindled fire. He told me that a 500 drum soundtrack would suit the film he was working on here in this bivouac. A seven hour black and white documentary about hillside goats and ogres. He explained that he had just been out and about shooting raw footage of a goat versus ogre wrestling bout. I did some tooting and banging for him, and he seemed pleased, though it was difficult to tell. Given his grim demeanor, he gave me one of his sausages. Little did I know as darkness fell upon the hills, that six months later, I would stand on stage accepting an award as a runner up in the most belligerent soundtrack award at a film festival in olma. Curiously, the trophy itself was a statuette of a puto, curly, locked and chubby and armed with a bow and arrow. I took it home to my new home, just outside the town perimeter, and I put it on my mantelpiece and every now and then,

as the fancy took me, I smashed it to smithereens with a hammer, and then glued it back together. Now, when I wander in the hills, tooting my Fife and banging my drum, that pudding Leave me be.

After that piece appeared on the hooting ad website@www.oneonone.org letters poured in from readers, eager to make their own putty, wondering how to go about doing so. As an example of one of these letters, is the one I got from someone called Tim thurn. Dearest Frank, he writes in his overfamiliar way, I'm eager to make a put out of my own, but have absolutely no idea how to go about it. Can you offer any tips to a cack handed reader whose previous efforts at craft project has ended in disaster? passionately yours, Tim. The first thing I will say is that cat candidness in and of itself should never be Tarah hooting yard reader or listener from undertaking any craft project, however complicated as M people put it so eloquently, you've got to search for the hero inside yourself. Do you think for one minute that heroes such as utilities or Tristram Shandy, or what would have shrunk from the challenge of puto making? Have they had to face it? No, they would not. So stop whimpering and just get on with it. To make your own puto it's absolutely imperative that you first acquire a grounding in the art of the Renaissance. In fact, you need more than a grounding. Ideally, you should be able to triumph over Bernard Berenson in a quiz on the subject. Berenson has been dead since 1959. So to prove your mettle, you must consult a back street medium and have him or her summon the shade of Berenson from the other side. Apart from their immense knowledge of things past present and to come. spectral beings from beyond the grave can be surprisingly quick on the buzzer, intense quiz type situations, so you should get into some fairly hefty practice. Tech when Wittek whose coughing prompted correct answers from major Charles Ingram in the great Who Wants to Be a Millionaire cheating affair of 2001 and was himself a contestant on the show, built his own homemade four button console and rehearsed on it for hours. This is the kind of preparation you would do well to imitate before facing the spirit of Bernard Berenson in a Renaissance art quizzle. Having our head crushed or shaded Berenson and demonstrated your sweeping knowledge of the subject, you'll now be in a position to make your own puto get some potty molded into a puto give it a lick of paint, and voila. There you have it. If you wish to make edible putty for the decoration of cakes and pastries and so on, you can use dough instead of party and food colorants instead of paint. A generous slice of chocolate swiss roll upon which a pair of dough puddi are disporting themselves, makes the perfect condition to a workers lunchbox and is said to aid productivity on the factory floor. According to the nutritionist catnip wedge, wedge has been dead even longer than Bernard Berenson, but he proffered his opinion when his Phantom be spattered, rather disgustingly with an excess of Ecto plasm was summoned by Madame booboo, the Backstreet medium I consulted

under the Bolsheviks, beyond the Urals, the achievements of a hero worker were not celebrated by the energetic battering of bongos. Yet that's precisely what happened with babinski. The teenage repair man's record breaking feats of repair were so wondrous, his proletarian heroic without parallel, that he was told he could devise his own ceremony. bongos thousands of them, granted the lanky worker, his mustache was incipient, and not yet the massive walrus it would later grow into local party bigwigs were disconcerted by his choice, but reason that if they poo pooed his desires, they might well be carted off to camps, or even shot. So talismanic was babinski his name in that brief golden summer, he could have asked for anything. And so they said about obtaining thousands of sets of bongos and drilling the other workers in the rhythmic bashing of them. This was not without its difficulties. For beyond the rerolls. The average worker was too downtrodden and exhausted to put much vim into endless hours of Bongo practice, after a day's drudgery in the factory. The factory a fast come a vast complex set within a vaster complex in an industrial Island, plopped in the middle of immense snow bound nothingness, produced bolts and screws and tires and spikes and washers, oh, all sorts of metal and rubber bits and pieces, and relied on an array of engines and machinery, which was prone to clogging and collapse and jamming up and fracturing. And it was babinski with his delicate fingers and his methodical brain and his familiarity with Greece and his inhuman concentration who fixed everything. Sometimes before it was broken. He was a Marvel and the factory Soviet knew it, and so he was mollycoddled and lacked for nothing. If he wanted a Bongo ceremony, he would have won. There was surprisingly little resentment of bubinski among his fellow workers. Often, those singled out for eminence by the party were loathed and matted about behind their backs. It was not unknown for a model worker. Shortly after the ceremony, extolling his virtues to suffer what looked like an accident or to be denounced or to have poison tipped into his lunch pail. The teenage repairman, on the other hand, was regarded in the tradition of the holy, innocent or holy fool. His Bongo choice seemed confirmation of this most here I work as opted for the standard ceremony with massive tractors and long speeches, and a supper of unusually thick borscht. Of course, there was nothing the least bit holy about babinski nor was he innocent nor foolish. inside his spindly frame beat Atari black heart, and within his cranium throb, the brain of a devil to babinski inner ear that's throbbing sounded like the pounding of 1000 bongos, and it was that infernal din he wanted to recreate in the world outside his head at his ceremony and all unwittingly because he was so magnificent a repairman, the Soviet authorities acquiesced Was it the masked bashing of bongos on that golden summer evening that tipped babinski over the age to the teenager, it was as if he could make real the demonic pulsations in his head. Only two weeks later, he embarked upon the first of his rampages. in years to come, there was much guilt among the workers who beat bongos for babinski. Intuitively, they knew if the party bigwigs did not that they had helped unleash the repair man's furys most of them never bashed bongos again. Though a few of them had caught the bug and formed underground beatnik clubs where bongos were bashed in, Kevin's far away from the railway tracks, even here as they smoked exotic tunisienne blackmarket cigarettes and preened their goatees the Bongo just told themselves they were trying to exercise the evil of babinski they would have been better occupied smashing rocks in Siberia. And the moral of the story is this. Always opt for the tractors and the speeches and the borscht even if the borscht is seen and watery and akin to beetroot based gruel.

Science Fiction seems to be very popular at the moment my wife has been I'm just not much of a science fiction person myself, but at the same that you know with all these films and stuff, but there's very few superheroes is fantastic as DAX pod. DAX pod clad in Amber, DAX pod, Uber person, atop a large building, as he so often is, I am that pod he says, King of standing atop large buildings declaiming. He declaimed that he is DAX pod, and he is clad in amber and is an Uber person. That pod fans gather in the street below, pairing their hero through binoculars. Some fans have alone yet, some fans are bluestockings DAX pod appeals to them, because he knows his Milton. He knows his Sir Thomas Brown, he knows his Sylvia Townsend Warner. Sometimes, as he stands, clad in amber in his cape atop a large building, he holds in one hand and literary work by one or other of this trio. He can, if he said, recite the entire works of Herman Melville from memory, including Pierre or the ambiguities. He is a man to be reckoned with. He swoops from the top of the large building, wherever and whenever he is needed. It may be a postal delivery error or a dog pound incident or planetary capitalism, whatever it is DAX pods, whoops. That's that pod swoops in his one piece ombre costume, for he is dachte pod and must swoop in number to placate his fans. They profiled him in gak magazine readers or DAC pod at home, clad in amber with Amber clad Mrs DAX pod, and the DAX pod cubbies all clad in amber to their farmhouse with their pigs. The pigs were snorting, wallowing in Mark filthy, filthy, filthy and cloven of hoof

Thompson news now see bad i calculus pony bonus who Bitcoin nor fregean este Gaius petronius arbiter. That is, if you consider Well, the events of life, shipwreck is everywhere. Nobody considered the events of life with as much rigor as the out of print pamphlet in Dobson and he came to agree with petronius. Indeed, late in life, he became notorious for breaking up happy gatherings such as cocktail parties and jaunty sporting occasions and infants birthday celebrations by brandishing mezzotints of famous shipwrecks in the faces of those gathered and reciting in a booming voice, the wreck of the hospice or the wreck of the Deutschland, or both. The mezzotints Dobson clip from a magazine to which he subscribed for many years, part Phrygian peacocks weekly shipwreck news collected accounts of shipwrecks, real and fictional, usually written in Europe prose and illustrated them with mezzotints, many from the hand of noted mezzotint East Rex tent. Neither Partridge nor peacock had the slightest interest in improving safety at sea, nor did they campaign for better lifeboat provision, or similar initiatives. Quite the opposite. In fact, Partridge and peacock were a gruesome pair, who relished the horror of shipwrecks, clapping their hands in unseemly Glee when they received fresh tales of maritime disaster. They employed a team of backroom scribblers to win purple and embroider the basic reports, which came clickety clacking into the office on some kind of ticker tape e fax e gubbins to Judo had themselves invented. Dobson never wrote for the magazine, although both Partridge and peacock begged him to do so. There was one particular winter when either both either or both of the creepy cousins came banging on Dobson's door, offering blandishments, but the pamphleteer never succumbed. Even in the depths of penury, he appears to have held himself aloof, which is the more curious when one considers how devoted a reader of the weekly he was. Other still, that shipwreck is one of the few topics one of the few events of life, to which Dobson did not devote a pamphlet of his own. It is true that he penned more than one Blizzard ringley infant tile in komiya upon mezzotint East Rex tense shipwreck mezzotints. The ones he clipped so carefully from the magazine every Thursday morning for untold years, and which, late in life he took to pressing upon the attention of jolly partygoers, but of shipwrecks in and of themselves. He wrote Not a word. Although she did not share Dobson's macabre interest, marigold to one set the wreck of the Deutschland to music. She was at the time, a pupil of grim beetle browed composer Horst ghac, who set the task of using father Hopkins great poem as the basis for hamo crono transduction for voice piping valves and flutes to be played while standing on one leg. Legend has it that she tried to get Dobson to sing the words George rehearsals in a farmyard bomb, but the project had to be abandoned. When cows toppled over and goats got the vapors. hens became hysterical. And rooks and bluebirds plummeted from the sky.

Son Horst ghac. Is he a composer or a film director? He seems to be both. I don't think he appears in this next piece although you can never be too sure. upriver beyond the rubber tappers camp there is a hot and apt hot for Mr. Kurtz. And it is here you will find the ghost of Don Pedro the walnut man. In life, Don Pedro was known as the walnut man because he seemed forever to be chewing upon a walnut and he carried always in his pocket a paper bag crammed with walnuts. When he died and found himself wandering as a ghost. He learned that there are no walnuts for the dead, none to chew and none to carry in his Phantom pockets. His ghost was drawn to the hot up river, as if by magnetism, and now the ghost of Don Pedro haunts the heart, bereft of walnuts and never addressed Mr. Kurtz would have been at home in this heart set in a thicket of dense foliage in tangled in front, a long long way up river, but Don Pedro's ghost loads it. He Keens and whales and bashes upon walls and overturns the furniture, much as he desires to jump into a boat and paddle down river to where the rubber tappers hang about in their camp, drinking advic dip and exchanging lewd stories. He's impelled to remain in the heart, miserable, and craving walnuts. What did he do in life? Don Pedro, the walnut man to earn such a fate? Did he kill or maim or crush the spirit of another? Did he offend the mighty forces which pass out the destinies of the dead? Why is he forbidden to arrest and made a stalk this Kurt's hot up river and its little fenced in garden, where grow wild fruits and berries and crees of precious SAP, but no trace of walnuts. If we could answer even one of those questions, we would know more than it is proper for us to know they will be a shift in the balance of things and a new world would be open before us. But what it would be a world even more terrifying than the one we inhabit. And we would want to wrap cloaks around our heads and hide in the shadows. But we would no longer have any shadows only a hideous light beating eternally upon us. As it beats upon the ghost of Don Pedro, the walnut man even as he crashes into the walls of the heart and knocks over chairs and still still tastes those walnuts he chewed in his memory of the life before when he had a mouth for chewing and a paper bag crammed in his pocket.

Finally, very quickly, this week, I bought a loaf of bread, I tore a trunk from it and shove the trunk into my head. From my head. It went down to my belly but I wanted it to go to my brain. I imagined my brain is the same consistency as a chunk of bread. I think of my head as a bread been there again. Maybe my brain is more like a lump of dough. You don't keep dough in a bread bin. You keep it in a sack, you hang the sack on a hook in your pantry. Whenever you need some go you open the sack and take out a handful. Then you close up the sack. So maybe my head is more like a sack on a hook in a pantry. It's lucky that my pantry is lit by a bright electric bulb, a bare bulb of illegal wattage without a shade and I took the pantry door off its hinges. I left the hinges in place nailed to the frame without purpose but visible and buffed every day with a rag. And that's the end of this week's show. I hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye
