Good evening, my name is Frankie and this is hooting out on the air. troost van dangle brax peppery constitution is the subject of not one, not two, but three new publications and book, a pamphlet and a monthly magazine. One might think that the Constitution of a suburban shaman is too thin a topic to support a regular periodical, particularly such a fat and glossy one. But that's to discount the mano mania of its editor. Tilly welke stallholder Tilly is a woman of considerable intellectual energy. early in life, her ambition was to become like Eva crane, a pivotal figure in the world of beekeeping for half a century. But she had to abandon this plan. When it became clear that Tria she might she simply could not get her head around the difference between bees, wasps and Hornets. She would stare for hours at photographs or illustrations or dead bees, wasps and Hornets suspended in aspect or a similar jelly. But all that happened was that her brain became a fuddled and fuming thing, and she had to go to the cantina who Berman's department store for a reviving cup of tea. It was over one such refreshment that she first encountered the name Joost van dongle BRAC. The suburban shaman had been invited to respond to a q&a in that week's issue of dasht beekeeping ambitions magazine until he found some of his answers fascinating. For example, asked who he would invite to his ideal dinner party, Van dongle BRAC listed jack and Bobby Charlton jack and Bobby Kennedy, jack teagarden, Bobby prevot and Eva crane among some 200 guests in response to the question, oh, juiced adduced Why hast thou forsaken me? He reportedly answered with a stream of heavily sub edited invective. What really took tillys fancy though, was the revelation that van Dong aubrac had a peppery constitution, downing what remained of her cup of tea, she hurried out of the canteen, popped into a kiosk to buy a bus ticket and a carton of expensive Paraguayan cigarettes, and dawdled impatiently at the bus shelter until the number 5724938 arrived, settling herself in the seat just behind the driver. She plotted the first edition of Joost van dongle brax peppery constitution monthly magazine. As the bus gathered along the muddy line out of town, pass the swimming pool and the Heron enclosure, down through the big frightening tunnel and out onto the sycamore and looping lined highway, picking up speed as it scraped through villages named after French film directors swerved off towards the blister lane bypass then thundered inexorably downhill parallel with the derelict funicular railway until it reached the bus Depo on the outskirts of the tiny and gruesome fishing village, where Tilly rented half a barn during the summer months. It was winter, so she had no key and had to clamber in through a funnel at the back of the other half of the barn and then smashed down the connecting door with an axe. A week later, the first issue of her magazine appeared on the shelves of aldemar purgatives pie shop a newsagents it's sold out within minutes for the grubby fisherfolk of the village had a seemingly unquenchable enthusiasm for the work of Simon Sharma and ever canny. Tilly had persuaded the historian to contribute a cover story. Sharma had never even heard of Van dongle BRAC, but Tilly had given him free rein to write whatever he liked, and then edited the piece by inserting the suburban shamans name and references to his peppery constitution at whim. If Simon Sharma complained, she reasoned, the threat of her acts to his spectacles would silence him. As we have seen, Tilly was a dab hand with that axe of hers. Another reason for the sales Blitz was that Tilly gave away one of our old mar purgatives, homemade celery and beetroot pies with each copy of the first issue. Now, the old ma was as tight fisted a Crone as you could imagine, until he had to pay for every single pie out of her own pocket. Having spent the last floor in an offshore hedge funds to produce the magazine and as ignorant of complex financial instruments as she was of the difference between bees and wasps and Hornets. Tilly was forced to go to her bank Manager to beg for a loan.

Likely emptied hedge fund her bank was based offshore for legal or possibly criminal reasons, and the scuppered trawler in the cabin of which the bank manager held court. Like a Latter Day Neptune was a day's hard rolling out at sea. by dint of an or mishap, tillys little boat ran aground on screen whom Puj sands, invariably described as treacherous by those in the maritime know, she wasted a precious week living off rainwater and eels, until rescued by a floating zoo. By chance, the zookeeper captain was both the uncle of the bank manager and a lifelong devotee of Joost van dongle BRAC, and he gave Tilley a handful of cash to buy sufficient pies from Oldsmar purgative. It is a minor tragedy that Tilly never spoke to the captain about her dashed beekeeping ambitions for buyer further eerie coincidence. This polymathic nautical zookeeper had some years past devised a completely idiot proof method for telling apart bees and wasps and Hornets, which even Tilly might have understood. Oh, that was a few months ago, and even though there are no more free pies, and Simon Sharma has refused ever to write for it again. tillys magazine continues to befuddle those marketing experts who predicted ruin. It is now on sale, not only in old mar purgatives pie shop and newsagents but also in who Berman's and copies can be consulted in the Library of Congress. Although Tilly becomes tight lipped when asked precisely which library of which Congress and some suspect she may be referring to a cupboard belonging to the Pang Hill butcher shops trade association. I began by saying that tillys magazine was one of three new publications devoted to Joost van dongle brax, peppery Constitution, the others being a book and a pamphlet. I realized now that I misread an item in the latest newsletter from the Pang Hill book true shops trade association, and that neither the book nor the pamphlet exist. I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick and tired of irresponsible butchers peddling falsehoods or ambiguities in their trade publications. And don't get me started on grocers fishmongers and pastry shop per process. It's time something was done. Start writing your plaque odds.

This is a story called cadets dilemma. I woke one morning from uneasy dreams to find a foreign person standing at the foot of my bed shouting at me. This was the beginning of a series of events so disturbing, so uncanny, that I'm reluctant to tell you about them for fear that I will not be believed. But I'm in a quandary. For if I do not unburden myself of this tail, I will surely go completely crackers, such as the fight for told by the foreign person. It was among the things he was shouting at me as I awoke. I didn't understand him at the time for his tongue was alien to me. And in any case is shouting was so deafening that I couldn't make out individual words, but later I had everything translated, read aloud by a trained actor and recorded on a cylinder. maddeningly, however, it was clear from listening to the cylinder that the shouting foreign person had forbidden me ever to speak of the things that happened for not only would I go crackers, but I would suffer from au and the dropsy and the bindings, and my legs and arms would be broken, and my belly would be a thing crawling with worms, and I would shrivel up and die. What a dilemma I was in to be sure. I said that the shouting foreign person was standing When I awoke at the foot of my bed. In truth, it was not really a bed, but a wooden pallet laid any old house on the floor, onto which I had dragged a mattress or what passed for a mattress under the present regime. So the foreign person was not just standing there, which would have been alarming enough. But towering above me. It was a foreign person of No You mean stature who shouted at me in his weird guttural language? I would say he was seven feet tall at a guess. And if that sounds implausible, broaden your mind. This globe is dotted with extremely tall persons hither and yon and all I'm saying is that one such person was standing at the foot of my bed. shouting at me. I think if I still had a bed to sleep in, I would have been better able to cope with the situation. The shouting foreign person would not have loomed so Titanic had I been raised up from the floor, the angle from my head to his less acute. Also, I would have had blankets to pull up to my chin and a protective gesture, rather than having no blankets. The regime is dedicated to the reinvigoration of its citizenry. And that's why we're bitten to sleep on pallets, without covers, and with any windows that have not been bricked up flung open as wide as they can be flung. such measures are as of today still optional, though rumors fly, as rumors will that the era of coercion will soon be upon us. I am doing my best to help usher in the bright new civilization promised by the regime. And I can say with pride that I was the first person in my cadet tower to smash up my bed with a fire axe and nail a broken clapper of wood into three pallets donating the spare pair to the Rex Harrison tower for the destitute, to which I had already given two thirds of the stuffing from my mattress, that we still have a need have need of a tower for the destitute has been described as a blot upon the regime. But I challenge anyone to show me a regime without a blot. It can't be done. The shouting foreign person was in the cellar sort of blot in that his appearance was anomalous and untidy and that sort of rupture in the natural order. He ought not to have been there but on ignore bubbly like a blot he was. I'm afraid all I could do at the time was shriek this did not stop him shouting, and boy, oh boy, did he shout. It was so loud, he would have raised the roof if I'd had a roof rather than the frayed tarpaulins stretched over my room at the top of the tower. The actor I engaged to record the translated shouting onto a cylinder did not shout, but he declined the words in a thespian boom that was quite loud enough.

I had come upon this actor when I went to see a regime recommended production of Jasper pox haven in his amusing electrical wiring systems, a play of great potted resonance. I'm not much of a theater goer and I doubt I would recognize potted resonance great or small without a prompt. But I swooned with pleasure whenever this particular actor opened his mouth. So he was the natural choice when I needed someone to record the translation of the foreign person shouting. hiring him was easy enough, as he was a part time cadet and live below me far, far below me in the cadet tower. more troublesome before that was finding a translator. Bear in mind that I had no idea from whence this foreign person had hoped, nor in what barbaric language he did his shouting. It was with some reluctance that I asked around in case anyone else had been woken by the blot, for I did not want to gain a reputation as a cadet in Thrall to anomalous phenomena. Lord knows we have enough of such creatures, more and more of whom have been crawling out of the broken Brickworks into the regime adopted its current very wise policy of isolating them in a tower of their own near the frontier. Soon we shall have no more of these tiresome cadets in my own tower. And that will be a small but significant step towards the bright new civilization we are promised by the right regime under the guiding hand of the great Helms woman. I never did find anyone who admitted to having been woken up by a shouting foreign person at the foot of their palate, and happened upon my translator through pure chance. I was paddling in an approved paddling pool and struck up a conversation with one of my fellow paddlers. In the course of our conversation, she told me she was a translator who specialized in barbaric and guttural languages. I hired her on the spot, without telling her what it was I wanted her to translate. And as we each child, our feet dry while sitting on the cement blocks surrounding the paddling pool, I swore to secrecy. At first she balked at this fishy suspected moral turpitude as well she might, but she was reassured when I flipped my cadet coupon out of my pocket. She did the translation that very day, and the next day I ran aground the actor with the booming voice and had him record the cylinder. That's it was that I learned that I would go crackers if I did not tell anyone about the shafting foreign person at the foot of my palate, and all the subsequent oddities that befell me and crackers accompanied by other fears and maladies Followed by death, if I did, that was and remains my quandary. I am of course making the assumption that the bolasie foreign person shouted the truth. It's never for one moment crossed my mind that his shouting may have been twaddle or the purposefully so or otherwise. Nor have I entertained the possibility that my paddling pool translator's grasp of his barbaric tongue may have been less than expert. I have implicitly trusted both parties. Perhaps that makes me a fool, but the crunches that there is no one I can ask to judge due to the nature of my dilemma. I can see where this is leading. You know, I know that the regime will succeed must succeed in reinvigorating the citizenry and realizing the accomplishment of our bright new civilization. But now, I'm assure as I conduct can be that by the time that golden era dorms I shall have been turfed out with my tower and I shall be languishing either out at the frontier in the tower, the cadets in Thrall to anomalous phenomena, or worse, just down the road and the Rex Harrison tower for the destitute. Whichever comes to pass, I shall no longer be the perky cadet I am now I will be blocked.

Frank Key  16:38
There were a couple of mentions in that piece about reinvigorating, reinvigorating the citizenry. And I did occur to me the other day that we hear a lot about lack of interest in the party, political process and so on. And I thought that the resignation of Ming Campbell as the leader of the Liberal Democrats, actually leads to an opportunity to reinvigorate party politics. And I've developed a three step program to do so the first step is that the Liberal Democrats should elect Chris hewn as their leader. After that, there should be some kind of push in the Labour Party and Jeff Hoon, should replace Gordon Brown as the Labour Party leader, and then after that the the kind of really traditional Tory values should kick in in the Conservative Party. David Cameron's posh but he's probably for the really, really, really posh is probably a bit new nouveau riche. So what they should do there is replace Cameron with Lord Hume who's in the House of Lords but never mind Lord Hume Of course one from the same family as Sir Alec Douglas Hume. So I think that would probably really work because then you'd have a kind of Hume Hoon KUNE battle, which, if nothing else would make political discussion programs quite interesting. What am I babbling about? anyway? Hume Hoon, Hume human. This is called airport Chaplin. And it's Episode 849 of hooting yards detergent opera booth, loosely based on the groundbreaking Scottish TV series of 1979 80. If any of you remember airport trapline Well, wasn't it a Marvel? But this is the hooting yard version. We post swans whooped on the airport pond. Beyond it by the grain silo, the airport squirrel skittered and twitched as if terrified, but it was on home ground and scared of nothing. As with all squirrels it twitching was merely the outward sign of its high metabolic rate. A path led from the grain silo to runway number 19 where on this fog bound morning, a supersonic Uber jet from a bygone era sat rusting on the gravel. Runway 19 had been the experimental runway where Madcap airport boffin Dr. loopy Streisand used to conduct his Madcap boffin re before his transfer to another airport in another country on another continent far away across the sea. He had not welcomed the move, flailing his weirdly dainty little fists at the airport security guards who dragged him forcibly from his boffin hat and shoved him onto a chopper. That was years ago. Now, neither the whooper swans nor the squirrel had been born. But everyone knew that Dr. Streisand was forever plotting his return and his revenge. It was the ever present nature of the Madcap boffins threat. That explains why this episode of airport chaplain opens as they all do with the pre breakfast counter Streisand meeting. For very clever strategic reasons. The meeting is held in a different part of the airport each day. Although due to budgetary constraints, the team invariably gathers in the canteen, and what a great canteen it is. Here, they will be able to have their breakfasts as soon as the meeting concludes, except of course for the airport hunger artist, who will scamper back to his pod suspended from the branches of a sturdy oak tree in the airport spinny and it is at the edge of the Spinney where we find the massive stone slab which serves as the airport chaplains altar upon which the daily sacrifice of a goat is made. More on that later. Here's an example of the sort of stuff that was said at the meeting. According to the console's What is your apprehension of the proximity or distance of the Mad boffin bent on revenge? readings confirm that we remain steadfast on code lavinda fight is butter poltroon capstick. Also before breakfast and indication is given a very new plot development. For example, the airport floozy may let slip a creeping disdain for the new moustache grown up on the upper lip of the airport Tinker.

Both her disdain and his moustache will prove significant in the weeks leading up to the beltane bonfire. Meanwhile, in his cubicle dug into the bunker below the airport socks and neckties franchise, Eric Maxwell Davis the night watchman settles down for his well earned KIPP. his backstory is important. He's often behaved skittish lately, and equally often been such a So besides that gloomy music accompanied his appearance. desolate Bell's clang does his signature crude in many episodes. Explicit hints are dropped, that he may be the fictional brother of Peter Maxwell Davis, the master of the Queen's music and tension is sometimes created by having Eric's scenes filmed with the whooper swans visible in the background, suggesting to viewers that as his brother once did, Eric might eat them. So feeble is the power of the generator in this corner of the airport, however, but none of the swans has yet been electrocuted. Unnecessary precursor to it, ending up on Eric Maxwell Davis is dinner plate unkempt and Harry, the recipient of an alarming number of blood transfusions. The airport chaplain lumbered interview from behind the pasteboard partition. around his neck he wore a loop of string from which hung bones and teeth and fragments of the True Cross, as he never tired of roaring at the congregation who packed into his chapel. His was an interfaith chaplaincy, where all known Gods held sway except one or two of the ancient Egyptian ones, whose rough the chaplain had incurred in a long ago episode, fondly remembered by a happy few. Before heading out to the spinny the airport trapline have to hear a confession from the apprentice goat boy, a seething, fractious, unhinged dyspeptic rancorous, unhygenic closeted bitter child. For the past four years, there had been a conceit that the goat boy was forever busy in his workshop, building the sacrificial goats out of plasticine and straw, always off screen, and so plunking him into the confessional box was seen as a clever variation. Father Humberto What do you have to confess airport goat boy? goat boy off screen. I am the love child of Mad airport. boffin loopy Streisand, and I'm constantly scheming to affect his return, where upon he will wreak his revenge upon the personnel of the airport, including the floozy and the Tinker and Eric Maxwell Davis the night watchman and you airport Chaplin.

It's about three and a half years since hitting out on the air first start in four years since the hooting out website made its debut, and in that time, it's fair to say that I've built a reputation as something of an authority on the out of print pamphleteer Dobson. As a result, I find myself filled in a bewildering number of messages on my metal Tapping Machine from Dobson just around the world. The range of inquiries is quite astonishing and evidence of the continued relevance of this towering figure of 20th century pamphleteering. On more than one occasion, I've been asked to provide a digest of the calls that come in, and my replies, but I'm afraid that's not possible for after scribbling on the back of a toffee apple wrapper, each query in my learned response, I dispose of them in a cauldron of flaming pitch. Otherwise, I'd be up to my ears in toffee apple wrappers and lack dignity. As a special treat, however, I decided to save one sample inquiry from destruction, and presented here together with my reply. Dear Mr. Key wrote a correspondent from the picturesque Essex seaside resort of Jay wick. I wonder if you can set my mind at rest regarding a biographical detail was Dobson the Dobson of the financial services consultants, Price Waterhouse Bailey Dobson Cooper Cooper hateful, which, as is well known, attempted an unsuccessful leveraged buyout of Huberman department store in 1971. The simple answer to this is no he wasn't. In fact, the very idea of Dobson obtaining a position for which even a vague knowledge of finance was desirable has me laughing like a drain. Interesting there ever. The pamphleteer may have been as qualified as anyone else to adorn the boardroom of the company. I always research my replies to correspondence with thoroughness and rigor. And in delving into this one I discovered some striking fact. Now that the bid for Huberman was unsuccessful therein lies a clue what I found toiling away in the cuttings library of the pointy town bugle and cruncher with it now the price water nor house nor Bailey nor the Dobson, who is a different Dobson, nor Cooper, nor the second Cooper, no hateful had the faintest idea what a leveraged buyout was. Half of them was scurrying about looking for a lever, like Hazel Blears is central lever, while the other half were tapping SAP from a pumpkin Korean bulges spinny. They collected the sap each in his own pail and carted it back to their headquarters in time for an important meeting with the Huberman people. As one of the Cooper's remarked later from his prison cell. We couldn't find the damn lever. Our bank accounts were empty, and the police dogs were snapping at our heels, but at least we had plenty of SAP. much good it did them. And well, there you go. I think now you can understand why I burn all those toffee apple wrappers. That's all for this week. I'll be back with hooting yard next week. Bye bye
