Good evening This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. And we have a lot to get through this week so a better crack on. It is I think common knowledge that by eating the brains of certain animals we can boost our own mental powers. Granted, this is not a practice which has won the backing of the greatest living my stroke of the mind, Tony Buzan, but the results can only be described as Buse antastic the difficulty of course, has always been obtaining brains in the first place, and making them edible. Few of us are so ruthless that we would consider tearing the brains out of the heads of our domestic pets, our cats and dogs and budgerigars. And in any case, those are not the kinds of brains that will do much to supercharge our mental abilities. I know a poor soul who lived on a diet of budgerigar brains for a week, and he is now fit for little else but dribbling and writing features for The Guardian weekend magazine. Similarly, although your local zoo will provide a far greater range of animal brains, some of them particularly mind enhancing, such as the brains of giraffes and of exotic birds, zoos tend to have security guards who will taser you without compunction should you creep towards the enclosures at dead of night armed with a gimme a skull slicer and a spoon? Being tasered does not improve your mental prowess. Despite what you may have read in The Guardian. That article was written by budgerigar brains man. It's a very welcome development then there's a new section on the delicatessen counter who Berman's department store where lucky shoppers can buy a huge variety of boil in the bag animal brains at ridiculously low prices. The selection seems to have been made with human mental agility boosting as the basic criterion for we can find the brains of weasels and pigs and crows and cows and giraffes and hupo birds and jellyfish and starlings and wolves and locusts, and oak Cappy and trout and flamingos and bears, and monitor lizards and corncrakes and carp and badgers and Hornets and lobsters and ducks and gazelles and dozens of others all conveniently packaged and ready to boil. Faced with such a cornucopia, there's an obvious temptation to go overboard and to stuff your gob with particularly to some brains, such as those of the routing hog. This is why the staff at Huberman are fully trained to advise on the government's Five a Day guidelines and to hand out free leaflets with every purchase. To maximize your brain potential, it's important to follow certain tips. Your daily intake should include the brains of five different animals. Make sure you boil the brains in the bag until they're piping hot. Do not eat the bag best accompanied with a side dish of suid pudding. Having said that, there may be occasions when in order to boost a particular area of your mental apparatus, a judiciously limited diet can be helpful. For example, you may wish to improve your ability to interpret the scores of the more complex madrigals of Thomas Wilks 1576 to 1623 in which case you might want to eat a couple of boil in the bag conga eel brains for breakfast and supper each day. Studies have shown that there are substances in the brains of all eels, but especially the Congo, which stimulate those parts of the human mind receptivity to Madrigal score complexities. Admittedly these studies are very much in their early stages, and have yet to be given the imprimatur of any recognized academic Institute. But the experiments conducted so far have been more than promising. Separate research is being done by historians of both eels as food and of choral music on whether Thomas Wilks himself ate the brains of Congo eels during his time as a gentleman extraordinary the travel royal

generally speaking, however, unless you have a specific mind empowerment scheme you wish to propel forward it's best to stick to those five things. guidelines. Make sure you pick up one of the leaflets from Huberman delicatessen counter and study carefully the many diagrams and the foldout section. So you can learn to tell the difference between the various animal brains available, as it must be said that they all look quite similar when packed into plastic bags. One final note, those of you who fret about things can rest assured that according to the latest press release from Huberman boil in the bag buggery, Big Brain budgerigar brains. I'm gonna read that sentence again. Those of you who fret about things can rest assured that according to the latest press release from hoomans boil in the bag budgerigar brains are most definitely off the menu.

Mrs gubbins the octogenarian Crone given to knitting and villainy has recently come under the supervision of a doctor. It will not be too long before she becomes a nonagenarian, Crone and oh she's in terrifyingly tip top health for one so aged, there have been signs that all is not well. First, there was the abduction of little severine, the mystic badger, after which she went on the run for several months, holed up in a dank cave guarded by bats and owls. This was followed by her becoming smitten by the unlikely figure of Mark E. Smith, and her habit of playing the complete works of the fall at earsplitting volume on a brand new bang and Ola bang bang bang hi fi system, with her windows open at all hours of the day and night. A dorm visit from blanket and Blears respectively, sightless and diminutive, and somehow all the more military for being so set her back on the straight and narrow. Couple of weeks ago, like gubbins knitting circle invited Rolf Harris to give a talk, unable to attend yet honored to be asked. Harris instead sent a tape recording of an entertaining address, in which he spoke for some hours about various Ralph and Ralph and rice and Ralph's faithfully. At one point he mentioned the name of Ralph denktash, the one time president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. hearing those two syllables danke and Tash together, Mrs. gubbins was propelled into a fugue state from which he has yet to emerge. denktash food syndrome is a thankfully rare condition, so rare that Mrs. gubbins is only the second person in history to display the symptoms. It was first identified by the Victorian mountaineer and eccentric Dr. henry hyde Hargreaves hopped in Hibbing deep Hoon, Dune, during a sojourn in Tashkent. The journals in which he wrote of his discovery, have long been lost or disfigured by potato mold, depending on who you believe. But the basic facts were retailed by Dobson in one of his early pamphlets. A top at Tashkent mountain one day in 1862, the doctors brain was ravaged by mysterious fumes, and when he tried to say Tashkent, it came out as denktash with him upon the peak with a dumpy, bearded sage, a man not unlike the Beatles, old pal, the Maharishi in appearance, who, when he heard the word denktash was sent into a fugue state. In his journal hipping dip Hoon, Dune spelled it food f double o g, but it's clear what he meant. What remains unclear is for how long the sage remains so affected, Dobson's account simply Peters out in that annoying way he had, and which can make his early works such a trial to read. also unclear is the nature of the food itself. In Mrs. gubbins case, it appears to take the form of dribbling staring vacantly into the fireplace and absent mindedly unraveling not only the tea cozy she has herself been in the midst of knitting, but also those of her companion arrows in the knitting circle. Dr. Drain deck who has been called in to treat the lovable yet spiky Crone claims to be the only living at expert on denktash food syndrome. Unfortunately, the treatment we recommend consists of a two week retreat in a dank cave guarded by bats and owls with an abducted badge of accompany, followed by a therapeutic cause of listening to the complete works of the fall that is splitting volume. So round and round we go it seems. If you or anybody close to you is suffering from denktash food syndrome. There is a helpline number available, premium rates apply. And if you managed to get through you might be lucky enough to hear a pre recorded message from Rolf Harris telling you not to worry yourself sick. All callers are entered in a raffle with the chance to win one of Mrs. gubbins tea cozy knitting patterns. You must tell your parents before placing the call and if your parents have passed to the ethereal realm beyond our puny understanding, there is a range of Ouija boards and Ecto plasmic goo on special offer at Huberman department store.

After I posted the the text of that piece on the hooting yard website at www dot hooting yard.org as I'm sure you know by now, anyway. Yeah, I posted the text of that. And it mentions Mrs. gubbins and her knitted tea cozies and I was deluged with mail from younger readers, who complained that they had no idea what I was talking about. The general tone of these missives was along the lines of we missed a key word in the name of Heaven is a tea cozy for crying out loud in it. It would appear that today's youth have been seduced by something called tea in a bag and no longer make use of tea pots and thus of tea cozies. This is a sorry state of affairs. However, here at hooting yard we occasionally make attempts to be with it and groovy. So we decided to track down some of these so called tea bags and see where all the fuss is about. delegated rapporteur decked out in trendy East European clothing, strode manfully into an indoor retail and leisure consumer Park, and selecting a boutique at random, went up to a counter and said politely yet forcefully. I'd like a bag with tea in it, please pick chosen an inappropriate boutique to make such a request. However, for the only bags for sale at this counter well, empty runs with handles made of leather or plastic or cotton or the pelts of various endangered animals. surmising not unreasonably that bag and T had to be purchased separately. Dowty rapporter pick from the display, a small dimity Pipi bag, and having paid the criminally expensive asking price with his hooting yard card t m. made off along the rattling pneumatic pedestrian, express Walker Rama in search of somewhere to buy T. Locating An Emporium packed to the gills with grocery items are kept hunted the aisles until he found a cardboard box of shredded tea leaves. After paying for this at a bleeping self service console. He wasted no time in ripping open the box with his now old fingers until it looked as if it had been savaged by a squirrel. He then pulled the contents of the box into the puppy bag. The next step was to eat from the bag a lovely cup of piping hot tea, so our rapporter repaired to a yard where he knew he would find an outside spigot. Holding the Pipi bag open under the spigot. He filled it with brackish water, then zipped it shot. He's and caught the bus back to hemoglobin towers, where Mrs. gubbins was waiting with her array of giant Bunsen burners. Using a contraction of coathangers to suspend the Pipi bag over the fearsome flames. Crone and rapporter waited for the telltale sign of steam escaping from the partly unzipped Pipi bag to alert them that the bags innards were coming to the boil. From there, it was a simple matter of detaching the bag from its coat hangers and placing it under a tea cozy. Of course, Mrs. gubbins used a pair of heat resistant padded mittens to perform this action. Giving the infusion a few minutes to brew. The rapporteur then borrowed the mittens from lag gubbins fully unzip the Pipi bag and upturned it sloshing the tea inside into a couple of dainty tea cups. There was a little spillage But that was soon mopped up by a passing factotum with a mop and a pail. A dash of milk added and the GAO sat on a threadbare Ottoman to enjoy their well earned copper. All in all, and in spite of the sterling efforts of both the rapporteur and Mrs. gubbins herself, this seems to be a frankly foolish way of obtaining a cup of tea. And it is not an experiment we will be repeating.

Last week, I promised you two stories about characters called beppo different characters both called beppo. And I didn't have time to read one of them. So here's the other one. beppo was built by Franco. So he plotted his revenge beppo came armed with a stiletto. We are in Verona, circa 1566. Franco was something of a dab hand at bilking, but no match for a pointy thing prodding at his torso. That was why he bought an iron vest. They say that Franco walked away unscathed that day in 1566. But he never again built in Verona. He had been shaken, and there were dents in his iron vest. he embarked upon a ship and sailed away to the new world. aboard ship, Franco considered the rigging all those schemes and knots reminded him of the plots in which he had so loved to become entangled. But for Franco, a new world meant a new leaf. He would be a good and simple exile. Franco's brain became dizzy at the exotic strangeness of the New World. Seeking comfort in the familiar, he fell in with Jesuits. He helped them to convert the inker through fire and flame. He lost all reason for both tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth, and he scampered into the interior, naked and loose of limb. The interior was a wild place of dripping foliage and shrieking birds and globular fruits. frybo founded horrible. Come 1576 and Franco is in sways in turquoise Raymond. He is deep in the interior, and when he snaps his fingers monkey acolytes do his bidding. Ah, but hacking through fronds and creepers comes built beppo at the head of a clanking platoon. It will be man versus monkey, and much blood will be spilled

some factual information for you now, James Joyce was terrified of thunder and lightning and used to cower beneath a table during electrical storms. Dr. Franklin first showed that lightning is the same as the electricity made by the electrical machine as the electricity of the electrical machine is got by rubbing glass. So much of the electricity of the air is caused by the rubbing of moist air against dry air. A great deal is made by the turning into vapor or mist of the salt water of the ocean by the sun's heat, or by the blowing of the wind. More water is turned into vapor during the heat of summer and autumn than in winter. And this is why there is more lightning in warm than in cold weather. There is always a good deal of electricity in the air, and in clear weather it is generally positive electricity, but during fogs rains or snows It is usually negative electricity, though it changes often. It sometimes happens that two clouds, one charged with positive electricity and the other with negative electricity come near each other. And then the two kinds of electricity rush together. When a flash of lightning is seen and thunder is heard. The Lightning is the same thing as a spark criminal electrical machine. The only difference being that a flash of lightning is sometimes several miles long, and the spark only a few inches. The little spark gives out only half out the little spark gives out only a snapping sound. But if we were able to make a spark as large as a flash of lightning, it would cause as much noise as Thunder when a cloud filled with one kind of electricity comes near the earth. While the earth is filled with electricity of the opposite kind, the cloud may discharge its electricity to the earth. If any tall object such as a tree, a steeple or a house happens to be near where the cloud discharges, the electricity will often pass down it to the earth. In this way, houses are sometimes injured and set on fire and great trees are blasted into tiny pieces. Sometimes to human beings and beasts of the field are struck and killed. It is not safe therefore, to stand under a tree or close to a high house during a thunderstorm. James Joyce was safe enough cowering beneath his table. We see lightning in several different forms. Sometimes it's flashes straight, sometimes it is forked or zigzag. Sometimes it is round like a ball. And sometimes it spreads over the clouds like a sheet of fire. When a Thunder Cloud is near the earth, the flash comes straight down to the earth because there is but little air for it to pass through. But when the cloud is at a considerable distance from the earth, the air in the path of the lightning is made denser or thicker by being pushed together. And as lightning can pass quicker through thin than through thick air. It flies from side to side, so as to pass where the air is thinnest. Thus its path is zigzag or forked. When there is a very great charge of electricity in a cloud It is sometimes it's sometimes forces its way through the air in the shape of a ball. What is called sheet lightning is either the reflection or shine on clouds of a stroke of zigzag lightning which is too far off to be seen or light discharges of electricity from clouds which have not enough to cause zigzag lightning.

When lightning passes through air, it leaves behind a vacuum that is an empty place and the air rushing in to fill it makes the noise which is called Thunder Kannan in Finnish. We do not usually hear this until sometime after the flash of lightning because light travels more than a million times faster than sound. both light and sound traveling credibly faster than a human being. James Joyce say taking a stroll in the streets of crest. When the thundercloud is at a distance, the sound comes to us Little by little, and it is then called Rolling Thunder, just like one of Bob Dylan's concert tours in the 1970s. But when the cloud is near the earth, the sound comes in while Almighty crash. We can generally tell how far off a thundercloud is by noting how much time elapses between the flash of lightning and the sound of the thunder. If we can count to five as slowly as the tick talking of a clock between the two. It is certain that the cloud is more than a mile away. And we can probably come out from beneath the table. If that is where we have gone to cower. Lightning and its way to the earth will always follow the best conductor and when it strikes rocks a building or a tree, it will leap from side to side to find it. It likes pointy things rather than blunt or rounded things. And this is why lightning rods have sharp point. Buildings properly properly fitted with lightning rods are safe from being struck by lightning, because the rods lead off the electricity into the earth. When a cloud filled with electricity comes over the roads, the electricity will flow silently down them until the cloud is discharged and we see no flash and hear no thunder, we can feel sure the building will not be struck. the tops of lightning rods are usually made of silver or gilded, so that they may not rust and thus become worthless. The lower end of the rod must be carried down into damp Earth. If the earth is dry, it is better to carry the end of the rod into a well, because dryer things are not so good a conductor as moist earth and the lightning might leak from the rod at the lower end and go into the cellar of the building. High chimneys should have lightning rods on them because the suit in them is a good conductor, as is also the vapor which rises from them when fires are burning. In Finnish, the word lightning is Salama and a flash of lightning is Salam and llamados

apologies to any Finnish listeners if my pronunciation there was hopeless, but I did my best. And that's the end of the show. For this week. I'd like to leave you with a quotation from the curious book of birds by Abby Farwell Brown. And I'll say goodbye before reading it because I don't really think anything. Anything I do can follow this other than the next program. One day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all the beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locust grasshoppers, and other creatures who fly or hop or crawl and shut them up in a huge sack. Well, tide at the end. Water queer squirming muffle, buzzing, Bumble it made to be sure. Then the Lord called the woman to him and said, woman, I would have you take this sack and throw it into the sea.
