Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Last week in between reading other pieces on the show, I intersperse them with a list of names names of different types of owls. And this week I'm going to give you a very useful list of three letter. British place names. Here's the first batch. Out ash air Bix, bow box. COMM. Down Elm eally Esch I Foy. And we'll have some more later. Meanwhile, I'd like to read a story that is 20 years old. It was written, threatening the dying years of the Thatcher regime. And it goes like this. Dear Mr. corncrake, re Mr. B buzurg. Six dismal terrorists hoon. Thank you for your letter of the 20th of July regarding the above named, I'm happy to provide him with a reference. I have known Mr. bukh for 10 years, ever since he took up the position of Scrivener, dogs dog's body and wreck in my vast, gloomy factory perched on the hillside next to the lunatic asylum. At the time I engaged Mr. bukh. I suspected that he had some connection with the latter institution. And in the decades since I've had no reason to alter my opinion. You asked me to comment on my impression of Mr. buchs suitability for the job. Forgive me if I find this difficult. I do not wish to do violence to our native language, but to use the word suitability in conjunction with Mr. bukh is to mock the Queen's English. Indeed, it's to make a mockery of sense itself. My problems with Mr. bude began on his very first morning in my employ to settle him in I had instructed him to carry out a menial task, removing bits of goo from the interior walls of a vat. To facilitate his progress. He was supplied with a variety of tools, including a pencil sharpener, a pin cushion, and a decidedly ferocious blowtorch. No sooner had I turned my back, then Mr. buke became embroiled in a tussle with my pet Panza, which, crazed with hunger, managed to slip it to leash and embed its razor sharp fangs in his left leg for this impertinence. I have no option but to dock Mr. buke his first month wages. It was not a good start, but I have had many ne'er do well working for me in the past, and believed that I could yet mold Mr. buke into a marginally less repellent specimen of human dregs. To this end, I assigned him to work in the filthiest dankest wing of the factory, where he was expected to spend all day, dragging sacks full of huge iron lumps backwards and forwards in infested tunnels for no apparent purpose. So ineptly did Mr. boog execute his duties that I was forced to withhold his pay for a further year, I rang my hands in frustration, for the man was impossible. Given a simple task, he would be utterly incapable of completing it with the requisite speed, good humor and falling obedience that one expect. To take just one example, Mr. bukh failed to about one particularly heavy sack containing a score of medium sized anvils a single inch, despite being given all of five minutes to drag it 200 yards along a stinking tunnel, in which small bonfires of sulfur had been ignited moments before I set a wolf found yapping at his heels, but to no avail. The man was purely and simply workshop.

But I'm a fair employer, and I had no wish to consign him to the scrap heap of the unemployable and useless. Instead, I agreed with Mr. Bewkes that he could embark upon a training scheme. In return for a modest fee to be paid to me daily in cash. I offered to provide With a comprehensive course in a multiplicity of disciplines, both within the factory and in the adjoining administrative hellhole. In the first week alone, we covered a huge range of skills, licking my boots till like Sean prostrating himself on his stomach whenever I came within his sight and dribbling with happiness at the mere mention of my name. This stage in what can only roughly be called his career, Mr. buke crawled into my palatial office one day to request my assistance with a personal matter. tempted though I was to have been savaged by mastiffs, I reclined in my unbelievably comfortable executive armchair and heard him out. He confessed that he was in some financial difficulty and begged me to help. sipping my glass of ruinously expensive wine, I delivered a stern lecture on the virtue of Thrift and beat him about the skull with a copy of self help by Samuel smiles. I admitted that I was in a position to repay his paltry debts a billion fold if I was minded to, but that's such a course of action would not in the long run be of the slightest benefit to him. I then advised him that he could earn a few extra pence by selling various of his bodily organs, and thus better his financial situation, while basking in the knowledge that he was being self reliant, rather than coming cap in hand to his employer. To prove my point, I offered to buy one of his kidneys and three pints of his blood on the spot for which I would pay him for pens. As the bulk of his debts were monies owed to me, I generously deducted the four pens from his account. In this way, I was able to relieve him of the responsibility of handling any cash himself, and thereby falling prey to the inevitable temptation to fritter the money away on food, clothing or medicine. Only after this transaction had taken place, that I set the mastiffs on him. Not long after this incident, Mr. buga announced that he had found himself another job and wish to resign. If his name burbling was to be believed, he'd been offered the position of assistant slave at a charnel house, the main duties being to crawl on his hands and knees in foul pits of order. As I listened patiently, he explained that he felt this post would give him opportunities undreamed of in his current position, and that he was prepared to take a cut in salary in order to take up the offer. poking at him with a stick. I nodded my consent, I have no wish to stand in his way. My only concern was that he would have the decency to fulfill the terms and conditions of his contract before setting off for pastures new. I then reminded him of the form he'd signed on his first day at the factory, the main clauses being that in order to leave, he would have to give 40 years notice and to repay every single penny of his wages since day one. So my surprise, Mr. Boo hoo, moments before, had been adamant that he was adamant that he wished to leave, said that he'd like a few days to think about it. Once again, I nodded my ascent, then summon 14 of my mermaid Dawn's who bundled Mr. Boo goo out of my office and set him to work on his latest task, which was to lie face down in a muddy ditch while a herd of demented bison charged over him. In view of the above, I must add that I cannot improve recommend Mr. bukh. To you. His work is shoddy his attendance and punctuality leaves much to be desired, and I have the greatest doubts about his character. His sickness record is appalling, and I've been put in the uncomfortable position of having to threaten various members of the medical profession with violence after they were so irresponsible, as to provide Mr. Big with certificates. However, should you decide to ignore my warnings and offer a job to Mr. buke. He will be available upon completion of his notice period in 40 years time, you will sincerely be good.

I posted that story, and despite it being 20 years old on the hooting our website, and one reader commented in the comments, cheer up Mr. buke own 20 more years to go, which is worth thinking about. Anyway, this is called the lost lozenge. I felt pangs when I lost my lacing. I was in a bricked up brutalist, brickey building when I noticed it was missing. I'd mislaid it before once on a Thursday, and once outside a tent on a campsite of many gusts. It's a yellow lozenge, a small cake or tablet of medicine and sugar meant to be held in the mouth and dissolved, but I've never put it in my mouth. I carry it in the pocket of my trousers, whichever pair of trousers I'm wearing, and it's from my pocket. It must have fallen earlier without my noticing. On the first day, I found my lacing within minutes, it dropped onto the floor and the floor was covered in bright red linoleum. So the yellow of my lacing was easily visible. Outside the tent, I was perplexed, but a passing widow woman approached me holding my lozenge in her black gloved hand and said she'd seen it tumble onto the grass when I was doing calisthenics a few minutes before. Usually when I do my jumping about and somersaulting and so on, I wedge my last inch deep into my pocket and put a scrunched up rag or dry dish cloth in on top of it. But at the campsite, I neglected to do so for I was distracted by the millions of starlings swooping in the sky. In the brickey building, however, there was no red linoleum, and nor was there a helpful widow woman. Also it was bricked up, so there was little light for me to see by and soon it will be dusk and the brickey building would be darker still. I did not know if I had lost my lozenge here or elsewhere. No wonder I felt pangs. The pangs began in the pit of my stomach, as pangs often do, and slowly moved upwards until I felt a constriction in my throat. pangs like those that interfere with one's breathing can be lethal. To think that I might perish through pangs for something as tiny as a lost lozenge. And it was a very tiny lozenge. When manufactured in, I suppose a loss injury, it had been somewhat bigger, but before it came into my possession it had been partially sucked upon and some of the outer coating or dust dissolved. The semi sub state of the lacing was the reason it was so precious to me, and why I kept it in the pocket of my trousers and felt pangs when it was last. To be more precise, it was the identity of the sucker that was important for this lozenge had been sucked by my all time hero, the wrestling champion Bruno lapu Bell, he choked on it and spat it out and it landed at my feet, for I happen to be standing next to my hero on the balcony of a plush hotel. He was a guest of course, whereas I was a mere employee of the hotel, a mop of balcony tiles with my mop and bucket. Bruno lapu Bell stopped choking. As soon as he expelled the lozenge turned around and swept back into his suite. And I picked up the laws engine popped it into my pocket. That was years ago. And I've treasured the laws in Java since and kept it safe, except for the first day in the gusty campsite. And now today when for the third time I have mislaid it. I had other lapu Belle memorabilia, a milk tooth, a discarded cochlear implant a battery from his wrestling training machine. These were displayed in a small votive shrine I had made in my kitchenette, but the laws enjoy I prefer to keep on my person. Now leaning against a wall in the bricked up building. I mentally retrace the steps on my journey here trying to recall where I might have been when I lost I was sure that the laws it was in my pocket. There were many many steps to remember for I have come from afar on foot. I knew that I had the lozenge sawdust bridge because I had to turn out my pocket the customs post. I distinctly recall putting it back in my pocket. After the frantically eyebrows. Customs man gave me the tap with his Tapi stick clearing me to carry on across the bridge and down through the subterranean carpark past the gated hazchem compound and up again on the path alongside the allotments.

From there I hurried past the haunted Zoo and slowed my pace as I forded the river shallow sludge cross the football pitch and the park and the airfield then rolled down the slope towards the puddles and ponds The Hermitage there was another customs post here about but it was deserted, watched over by a solitary mordant Heron. I struggled through bind weed and brambles, and then followed for a few miles the line of the great celestial pneumatic railway until I reached the engine house where I turned off past the crushes and Hooters and thumpers and clunkers and carried on past the swan hospice and the post office and the ear clinic where Bruno lapu Bell had discarded that cochlear implant and had had a second one fitted, and the glue factory and the paper mill and the lunatic asylum and the Terracotta Army parade ground and the canoe makers and the clown shop and the windmill and the newsagent and the Aztec fundamentalist temple and the trendy so called sewage pudding skyscraper, and they'll bordello and the Ironworks and the futuristic plasma ray gun repair shop, and the guide dog enclosure and the bell Foundry and the cave full of vampire bats, and the other cave and the country club and the patch of muck and the bowling alley and Rolf Harris's house, and the pit of fire and the pit of doom and the Buttercup fields and the sinister laboratory, and I ended up here at the bricked up brutalist, brickey building and discovered that I had lost my lozenge. When I arrived, of course, the brickey building was not fully bricked up, I was able to make my entrance through an unlocked side door which led into the gloomy vestibule, on the walls of which hung the stuffed heads of otters and badges and giraffes. I lay down on the floor to take a nap. And when I woke I found that while I slept, the remaining unbrick bits of the building had been bricked up. I was so beset with pangs about my last lozenge that it did not immediately occur to me that I was trapped. Now, I've realized this is the case, I'm going to have to do something about it. I'm a shapeshifter. So we'll shimmer ethereally for a few seconds and become like a beetle and scuttle out of the brickey building through pipes and duct. It will take much longer to retrace my steps in beetle form, but it will be another fortnight before I can shape shift again, and I will search diligently for my lozenge and hope I'm not trampled underfoot by the crowds making their way to the wrestling stadium for Bruno lapu bells final bout

that was a longer than usual break because while the music was playing, there were exciting resonance scheduling decisions being made or something like that. Here are a few more three letter British place names. Ham, hey, whoa, hoo. Koi Eid ki que Kyo li li Lu ly. And there'll be some more before the end of the show. Last week, I explained what to do if your well freezes up. And this week, I'd like to give you some advice on dingey maintenance. If you haven't dingey Be sure to maintain it properly. Like all seagoing craft thingies can suffer from wear and tear which, if allowed to continue unchecked, will imperil their ability to remain afloat, especially in choppy seas or when sucked into a Maelstrom. The most prudent course of action is to enroll in a dingey maintenance evening class. Consult the prospectus of your local community Lifelong Learning Hub If such a thing exists, and if you do not see a dinky maintenance class listed bombard the hub outreach staff with pleas and demands and threats until they are cowed. You can use wheedling tactics such as suggesting that you will bring your own dingey to class for students to practice maintenance techniques upon. That way, you can sit back and watch perhaps smoking your pipe in a listless manner. While all the wear and tear on your dingey is repaired by eager hands. If the hub has a no pipe smoking policy, which it probably has, you can stand outside and pier through the window to watch perky young wannabe Chandler's fix all the rips and tears and curious discolorations in the fabric of your dinghy. You will want to be sure that the instructor is fully qualified. So in the period between enrollment and the first session, employed gumshoe to carry out exit exhaustive background checks. It has been known occasionally for dingey maintenance evening class instructors to be shameless charlatans who bluff their way into the job despite having little or no maritime knowledge. Your gumshoe should be able to flush outside rascals. If money is tight, and you cannot afford the services of a gumshoe, it's possible to vet the instructor yourself. So long as you have a pair of binoculars, a sturdy pair of walking boots, a dictaphone false identification papers, a pair of sunglasses and a hat. Most such instructors live in cheap rented accommodation in the less salubrious parts of town, even when they're qualified. So be prepared for your exquisitely refined sensibilities to be dragged into a moral sewer and take a packed lunch. When preparing the sandwiches for your lunch do not stint on the marmalade nor on the chopped up radishes for you will need to avoid hunger pangs while concealed in shrubbery keeping an eye on the communal doorway of the instructors trip rented accommodation, waiting for him or her to depart or to arrive. If you want to smoke your pipe after eating or sandwiches, wave your hand enough fluttery motion to disperse the fumes which arising from your place of concealment could betray your presence not merely to the dingey maintenance instructor, but also to any passing busybodies or police officers or civic politeness enforcement patrols. After a week or so of constant surveillance, you want to be in a position to judge your instructors rectitude. If they turn out to be a shady rogue, jump out at them suddenly from the shrubbery screaming your head off and pursue them down the insalubrious streets waving a hammer, keep chasing them until you're on the outskirts of town and then invoke an ancient municipal banishment order. Citing the use case of principal Geneseo, that should do the trick. If on the other hand, you learn that your instructor is superbly qualified in the field of dingey maintenance, with untold certificates and diplomas to prove it, creep quietly away, and be sure to arrive promptly for the first lesson. There you will be able to take stock of your fellow students and satisfy yourself that they're sufficiently perky to be entrusted with the maintenance of your dingey while you relax outside, looking through the window, puffing upon your pipe.

The combat sports which thrilled the crowds in the circuses of ancient Rome, was the pitting of blind men against ostriches. A savage and ugly spectacle, no doubt and one quite out of keeping with our modern sensibilities, to say nothing of health and safety legislation. But I can't help feeling that it would make a tremendous subject for a gladiator style movie blockbuster. The End Jeopardy and actor Russell Crowe, or as I prefer to think of him, the artist formerly known as blue fronted rockabilly star rustler rock is so talented, one can imagine him playing either a blind man or caked in prosthetics, an ostrich. What would the computer generated wizardry available today's filmmakers, he could appear on our screens as both antagonists, and indeed, his image multiplies a thousandfold as the buying blood crazed crowd. I might put my mind to drafting a screenplay in which our hero is, let's say, an ancient Roman haruspex who is blinded when a struggling chicken whose m trails he's attempting to rip out pokes its talent feet into his eyes. From there it's a shortened sorry journey to the Coliseum, where an enraged and starving Australia whites it strikes me that if there's a need to do the film on the cheap, a high tech ostrich outfit could be dispensed with. Russell Crowe is famously a knitting enthusiast and given the right wall, he could knit his own ostrich costume add a musical soundtrack of bumptious ditties by Randy Newman, and I suspect this could be a surefire hit.

Finally, this week, I just a brief word about the fishmongers prayer. After which I'll give you a little the final batch of three letter bridges place names. Oh Lord, through the infinite grace shower my counter with bream and place is the opening couplet of the fishmongers prayer. It has the distinction of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is why you'll rarely hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that within the rolling cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish, both edible and inedible, are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial Mano maniac named Egbert Bach. It was not himself a practicing fishmonger, nor indeed did he live in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little man whose ears were perplexingly shaped in as much as they looked as if they'd been stuck to his head upside down. his obsession with fish is thought to have been caused by a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders nine times out of 10 such happenstance will lead to a phobia. But in Bach's case it had precisely the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon his brain after his death, it was discovered that the area's devoted to fish and to the mongering of fish were terrifically shriveled. Some seaside vicars still include an abridged version of the fishmongers prayer in their services, but not many. And I'll leave you with the final batch of three letter UK British place names. And that will be the end of the show and I'll be back next week. morewhy old Ord or ra rule, ry, rig, ask a van WebM wickes why
