Hello, this is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. And I'm still coughing. And we're going to continue this week with diary entries of the great, the not so great, and the frankly fictional but first as, excuse me, first as a special treat. I'm going to read to you in its entirety, Chapter 20, of Ronald furbank novel inclinations, published in 1916. And not only am I going to read it to you, the whole chapter, but I'm gonna read it from memory, a feat of memorization, which you are welcome to tackle yourself when you know the text. So this is chapter 20. of inclinations by Ronald furbank. Mabel Mabel, Mabel, Mabel, Mabel? Mabel? Mabel, Mabel.

Frank Key  02:04
So there you are. That should have been? I did count, I think I should have done eight mabels. And when printed, they have exclamation marks after the name after each one. So there you are. You too can do that as a party piece. If anyone asks you, you can say I have memorized an entire chapter of a novel by Ron furbank. Whose birthday it is today. Incidentally, he would be 127 I think. I think I've counted that I born 1886. Magnificent novelist. Very good. I recommend him highly. He died in 1926 at the age of 40. But yet today is his birthday. Anyway, onwards with diaries and fictional athlete, Bob net to vol is one of very few fictional athletes to have kept them entirely non fictional diary, though quite how it came to be written is anybody's guess. Here he here is what he got up to. On this day in, in fact, not sorry, not on this date on the ninth of January. In 1926, the year of Ronald furbank death bounded out of bed, Spry and sprightly and cut two or three brisk balls William keepers around the room, before plunging my head into a pile of ice cold water, then I was out at the cinder track. Being fictional, I do not need to travel from A to be, I can simply be in one place, and then A moment later in another place. Generally speaking, that other places the cinder track, unless I'm taking part in a competition, when I might materialize in a field or a stadium, nor do I need to eat breakfast or indeed any other meal, except for fictional purposes. For example, if a sense of drama is wrong from me having stomach cramps from overeating, seconds before an important qualifying heat and an important sprint championship. Today I was in training for just such a competition. The pointy town all cameras high speed breathless, panting round and round the cinder track trophy. Those who follow my fictional career, no I placed in the top 17 in this contest in 1922, and 1923 and 1924. Last year, of course, I was attacked by a swarm of Hornets on the eve of the final and was unable to come Hate.

My coach, the irascible chain smoking old halabi, who is as real as I am fictional, was nowhere to be seen on this fine, cold January morning. I missed his reassuring presence. But did my practice sprint anyway, I ran round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round the thin the track at high speed, panting breathlessly all day. This is where I have an advantage over non fictional athletes, who would collapse in exhausted heaps after a few laps, being insubstantial, and some have said unkindly one dimensional, I only collapse if there is a sense of drama to be wrung from my doing so. This usually occurs in important races, such as the final of the sawdust bridge 100 mile flat out sprinting cap, and not when I'm merely on a training run, round and round and round and round and round and round the cinder track. I would have kept on running round and round the cinder track after the sun went down. But it was at that point as night Earth spread the sky and all was plunged in darkness. That old Hallo appeared. If he was not real, I might think he was a vampire. He looked at his stopwatch and blew his whistle and coughed up an unseemly amount of Qatar, and led me away to a nocturnal pole vaulting area. I had completely forgotten that I also had to get in shape for the pointy town, nocturnal pole vaulting challenge ribbon. So all in all, it was a pretty good day and night as my days and nights go. eventually found myself tucked up in bed at 5:59am. Justin time to spring out of bed, Spry and sprightly at 6am tomorrow.

We'll move on now to the 10th of January, and the Diary of a peasant from the 10th of January 49 BC. Woke up in my horrible ate a mess of pottage for breakfast. It was a bracing day in cisalpine Gaul, so I thought I'd take a trench down to the river to wake my weary bones and slop out the pot. It's not the best of rivers for slopping out for the water is muddy and red, but at least it's shallow, so there's no danger of drowning. So there I was swapping out my pot in the river when from behind me back in could Alpine goal came the thumping and clumping of a Roman legion liggio x ii jemena it said on their banners were dry had raved in the pipe part, which I had read in the Topiramate was under the command of Julius Caesar. And indeed it was he leaving his Legion, who now bore down upon me a frightful look on his face. Hi, I'm rude peasant, he cried. What river is this? I tapped my forelock and sprawled in the muck and told him it was the Rubicon. So over on the other side is Italy, he said. That's right. Oh, mighty Caesar. I replied, cowering. Even though I'm a mere peasant, I'm quite learned. I regularly Oh, excuse me.

Frank Key  09:32
Sorry, I've got a bit lost there. Even though I'm a mere peasant. I am quite learned. I regularly read the papaya tree and have a grasp of current affairs and the laws governing the Roman Empire. I thought it best to tell Julius Caesar what I knew. So I pointed out that if he entered Italy at the head of his Legion,

I tried to exercise Imperium, the inevitable punishment was death, not only for him, but for all the traps in the Legion. This gave him pause, and for a while he seemed unsure what to do. While he was hesitating, the following incident occurred. A person remarkable for his noble mean and grateful aspect appeared close at hand, sitting and playing upon a pipe when not only the shepherd, but a number of soldiers also flocked from their posts to listen to him, and some crumpet is among them. He snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it, and sounding the advanced with a piercing blast crossed to the other side. Upon this, Caesar exclaimed, let us go with the omens of the gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us. The die is now cast. I watched this, Cesar led his Legion across the shallow muddy red Rubicon into Italy, then took my slopped out pot and trudged back to my hovel. Nothing much else happened in cisalpine Gaul for the rest of the day, though, I suppose it's worth noting that I spotted a flock of birds sweeping across the sky at dusk. Alas, my knowledge of Ornithology is sparse. So I cannot say what kind of birds they were. And then it starlings.

We move on now to this day in the sorry we don't move on to this day. I'm getting confused. We move on to the 11th of January. In a staggering breakthrough Tip Top Grant ologists at a grant torium high in the Swiss Alps have discovered what they believe is the diary of the grumpy man, that terrifying figure from children's nightmares. As we all know, and shudder as we remember, the grumpy man dwells in a filthy and horrible and tenebrous cave. Weirdly, some sort of magnetic anomaly and the rock of which the cave is composed, has led to the grumpy man's bestie or grunt, being somehow recorded and preserved for posterity. by harnessing state of the art 78 RPM, shellac diskon groupement technology, the Swiss grunt ologists were able to transfer the awful sound from the dank interior of the cave, on to state of the art 78 RPM shellack discs with grooves a collection of said disks has now been made available to the public, so we can all relive the terrors of our taught them. Here is a transcript of the grunty man musing upon his existence on this day in on the 11th of January in 1913 and 1813 and 1713 and 1613 and back back at intervals of a century to before the earth was formed to before the universe existed to before time and space, back to that unimaginably distant past when the grunting man was all there ever was, or ever is, or ever will be. And the transcript is as follows. grunt grunt grunt

we're gonna skip the 12th of January and move straight on to the 13th and the 13th of January exactly 10 years ago, in 2003. And the diary of the we the poet Dennis beer pint who leads a far more exciting Life that one would expect of the author of several precious slim volumes of twee verse. If that is without him believe his diaries. Here is what he had to say for himself 10 years ago. Woke up and ate a bowl of thin gruel, apt for invalids for breakfast. But not before I was engaged in a life or death struggle with an enraged and half starved Panther, which leapt upon me from somewhere among the pansies and flocks in the garden. Eventually, I was able to smother it with a pillow, ruining in the process the pillowcase embroidered by art.so many years ago, with winsome scenes of Alpine frolic and glee. I wept for pillowcase, not Panther. After breakfast, I went to languish neurasthenic layer in a nook there to wring from the depths of my soul verse late or to have twee beauty before succumbing to the vapors. No sooner had I adopted my posture of language, however, and before air I had the strength to pick up my quill than the bright red Bakelite emergency hotline metal Tapping Machine concealed in the shrubbery began to bleep. I had an urgent message from international woman of mystery Primrose dent warning me of imminent attack by insurrection re forces barely had I digested the news, the new trio of helicopters word interview overhead, this gorging on rope ladders, dozens of brutish and pitiless special commandos, who tipped me out of my hammock, crushed my quill on the foot, pulled a grotesque sponge hood over my head and yanked me up into one of the choppers. I was being abducted. Who did, manacled and drugged with a serum. I had to think fast before I lost consciousness. I Marshal the techniques of the mystic oriental art of goon Fang, and freed myself snatch the vial of serum antidote I spotted in the pocket of the helicopter pilot, and risking all leapt out of the chopper. I made a wager that we were flying over the sea, and I won. I plunged into the ocean and sank many fathoms deep. But just as I was about to relax and come bobbing back to the surface, one of my ankles was grasped in the tentacles of a gigantic undersea pontoppidan monster, which dragged me further down, down and down to the seabed, where was its lair. Luckily, just at the point where I thought my lungs would burst, I found an anomalous air pocket among the rocks. I calculated there was enough air to keep me alive for 10 minutes. But the pontoppidan monster looked hungry, and I reckoned I had half that time at best. goon Fang would do me not a lot of good in a sub, sub aquatic environment that much I knew. But I had a ray gun, and I used it zapping the monster between the eyes. I then had to chew myself free from entangling fronds of seaweed before in the nick of time, I made it back to the surface and swam ashore. I took a breather on the glittering sands and ate a seagull which I beat to death with my bare hands. I began to try Greenland, hoping to find a bus stop. Sure enough, I came to one soon enough, and waited no more than an hour for the number 666 which would take me home. Halfway there, however, the brakes on the bus failed at the top of the perilously steep slope, and the driver perished from a heart attack. The bus gathered speed as it career down the slope towards I now saw peering through the windscreen, a vast warehouse stacked with drums of highly volatile and flammable chemical compounds, beside which a careless janitor had just dropped a lit match. As I clutched hopelessly at the steering wheel of the bus, it came away in my hands. In a few seconds time, I would be engulfed in the fires of hell.

It is at times like these I find poetry such a comfort, my own verses in particular, I began to recite the opening lines of my sonnet I languished neurasthenic in a gazebo, when all of a sudden and ineptly piloted hot air balloon came crashing to Earth in the path of the bus. And acted as a miracle cushion. This gave me an idea for a new poem, and I could hardly wait to get back to my nook to write the miracle cushion before it evaporated. I watched the warehouse explode in a sheet of flame and thanked my lucky stars. I walked home, exhausted but cheerful, whistling only as I unlatch the garden gate. Did I realize I had left my bus pass on the bus, I began to sob and crumpled to the ground keening like a widow woman. My shattered nerves will not withstand such a loss, I fell into a swoon where I lay, and that is where I was found at midnight by the Google of gak. Which in wrapped me in a grizzly shroud and dragged me away to its awful cave. I was in for a rude awakening on the morrow, but the morrow is st Mungo's day. So I pray for his protection.

Chronic citing life Dennis bear pint leads. There's at least one accurate statement in that diary entry. I mean, it may all be true, I don't know. But one accurate statement is where he points out that the following day is mangoes day and this year? Well, it's always the 14th of January. So it was earlier earlier this week. Monday, the 14th of January was mangoes day. So it seems appropriate to read some mangoes diary. For that day in the year 573. Precisely 1540 years ago, I woke up in the kingdom of Strathclyde sausages for breakfast. Thought about building another Cathedral but quite honestly did not feel up to it. While I knelt in the muck praying, a messenger person came hurrying along and told me that a mad prophet by the name of lie low Ken was rampaging about the place. He is apparently one of those wild men of the woods, the only difference being that he spouts prognostications, which have the effect of turning the heads of the peasantry away from the glory of Christ Jesus. Can you do something wholly to bring an end to his mysteries, said the messenger person. I shall see what I can do. I said, we're really, for forsooth I was weary and footsore and had many another malady has tend to afflict those of us living in such barbaric times. I struggled up for my knees, and tottered off towards that part of the blasted and inhospitable countryside, where this mad fellow was reportedly to be found. On my way, I saw a bird that never flew, and a tree that never grew, and a bell would never rang and a fish that never swam. It is not often you see a burden, a tree and a bell and a fish all together in close proximity, a burden a tree together, yes. And conceivably a burden, a tree and a bell. But the fishers well, that seemed anomalous, I wonder if it might be a miracle sent by the Lord? If so, what did it portend? These are weighty matters of great spiritual significance. Something that's most definitely not of great spiritual significance is the raising of this wild man Lalo Cain, who I found cutting capers at the edge of the forest. He was in garbed. In animal pelt, and exceedingly wild and hairy I brandished a jewel encrusted crucifix from the cathedral at him and bid him desist on pain of hellfire. It started to rain, and he retreated into the woods. I blessed a few strange Strathclyde peasants who were loitering there about and was pleased to hear them begin wailing and keening My name over and over again. Mango, mango, mango, mango, they wailed and keen. It was music to my ears. In the evening, I had a bath and an eerie premonition of death in a bath at some point early in the next century, This is

interspersed with the letter site fictional or possibly fictional diaries that I've been putting on the hooting yard website this year. I'll put in some real historical diaries to and yesterday, or was it the day before? It was it was yesterday 16th of January. I posted on the website, excuse me, I posted on the web website this entry from the 12th of January 1912. In the diary of Robert Falcon, Scott. Camp 68, height 9760. temperature minus 23.5. The worst has happened or nearly the worst. We marched well in the morning and covered seven and a half miles. Noon site showed us at Latitude 89 degrees 42 degrees south. And we started off in high spirits in the afternoon, feeling that tomorrow would see us at our destination. About the second hour of the march Bauer's sharp eyes detected what he thought was a Ken he was uneasy about it, but argued that it must be assessed triggers. Half an hour later, he detected a black speck ahead. Soon we knew this could not be a natural snow feature. We marched on, found that it was a black flag tied to a sledge bearer, nearby the remains of a camp, sled tracks and ski tracks going and coming and the clear trace of dogs paws many dogs this told us the whole story, the Norwegian to forestall this and are first at the pole. It is a terrible disappointment. And I'm very sorry for my loyal companions. Many thoughts Carmen much discussion have we had tomorrow we must march on to the pole and then Hasten Home with all the speed we can conquer. All the daydreams must go, it will be aware of some return. Gosh, and they did get to the pole the next day. Exactly 101 years ago today, in fact. But as we know, they never did make it back. So that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. Next week we'll have possibly more diaries, including the diary of Ford Madox, unstrap an odd town, and a diary entry from the out of print pamphlet did Dobson. Remember that you can read all of this stuff on the hooting yard website at hooting yd.org. And while you're there, you may wish to send me some money. There's a PayPal button. So hit it and do do what do what you know is right. You'll feel a warm feeling in your collywobbles if you do. Yeah, sorry, I seem to have been a bit distracted this week. I'm not entirely sure why. But I hope you've enjoyed the show in any case, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
