Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hooting yard on the air. And with typical professionalism I decided to start sucking a boiled sweet cough sweet. Very shortly before the program began, hang on, let me take it out of my mouth. Because that doesn't really work does it? Anyway, welcome to the show. I now don't have a boiled sweet in my mouth. Which means our mic cough. But anyway, we'll see how we get on. This first piece I'm going to read this week contains a thread accurately contained lengthy pauses. So I'm going to zip past the pauses because otherwise, for example, we're going to have 10 minutes of silence at certain points. You'll see these points when they will hear these points when they come up. Anyway, so well, you know, what I'm saying is that when I say that, I'll just get on with it. You will recall I hope the film speed yonder bond 1994, in which Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are aboard a bus, a bus, which will explode if it goes below 50 miles per hour, having been primed with a bomb by cackling evildoer Dennis, don't try to grow a brain jack hopper. I have been wondering if a similar adrenalin thumping conceit could be applied to the writing of pros. I'm not suggesting I do anything so foolhardy as to ask a disgruntled and slightly maimed ex police officer to hitch me up to a bomb which will detonate if I stopped writing. Well, I suppose that is what I'm suggesting. But cowardice or sheer common sense persuades me to hit upon a less perilous incentive. I have just spent 10 minutes staring vacantly at the screen trying to think what that incentive might be. In speed, Dennis Hopper is gleeful when a television reporter describes the fiendish quandary into which he has placed the bus passengers as the whim of a madman. He repeats the phrase to himself, chuckling now, I'm an almost inhumanly sensible chap, and not a madman at all. But perhaps the whim of a madman is precisely what I need to give vent to, if I wish to prime my pros with the inner drenching pell mell momentum of the film. Of course, not everyone would agree that speed is an appropriate model. Dennis Hopper rather overdoes the criminal mania. Keanu Reeves is wooden. And the best that can be said of Sandra Bullock is there she's irritating. And even though Keanu is fellow bomb diffusion expert, Jeff Daniels is killed himself. You know that Keanu himself and Sandra Bullock will escape unscathed. And Dennis Hopper come to a grisly end, because it's that sort of film. But predictability has its own special charms, and predictably predictability plus enter drenching pell mell momentum. It's clearly popular when we consider that speed reportedly earned its makers over 300 and $50 million. Now, if I could only devise my madman's whim, perhaps I could make a similar some from a piece of prose. The glum bat of misery swoops over my bonds as I stare at the screen, and regretfully admit to myself that this present piece of prose is not the one that will earn millions. Having said that, should any listeners feel impelled to deposit a vast sum of money into the hooting yard Pay Pal account, I'd be most grateful. But

Justice Sandra Bullock has to keep her foot on the accelerator of that bus. I have to keep tippy tapping away. It's true that I will not be blown to Kingdom calm if I stop. In fact, nothing at all will happen. I don't know. To grow a brain to know that, indeed I have the freedom to get up and walk away and make a cup of tea. So I think that's what I shall do right now. If I had a University of Arizona Wildcats t shirt, I would take the opportunity to change into it while the kettle is boiling. You will recall that Sandra Bullock wearing of the other top with the Arizona Wildcats logo proved to be a pivot on which the plot of speed hinges. When last I saw the film I have not yet learned that other great mainstay of Arizona life, the regional dish greasy doings. It seems to me that either yonder bond or his screenplay person Graham Yost, or indeed Keanu Reeves, or Sandra Bullock, or Dennis Hopper, or even poor killed off Jeff Daniels might at some point during the production have suggested adding a further layer to the Arizona reference by mentioning or better showing greasy doings. It would probably be stretching credulity to have any of the imperiled bus passengers tucking into greasy doings, but Dennis Hopper spends much of his screen time gobbling snacks while watching his mad man's wear man fold. So how difficult would it have been to make at least one of those snacks? greasy doings? Now I come to think of it, given that, as I said, the dish was unknown to me when last I saw the film, perhaps we are shown Dennis Hopper eating greasy doings. Obviously, I shall not rest until I've confirmed whether or not this is the case. So I'll have to watch speed again, with an eagle eye on the Dennis Hopper scenes. It's just occurred to me that I don't know what greasy doings look like, I must embark on further research before my next viewing, or I won't know them if and when I see them. And that will be a bloody tragedy. I don't know about you, but my feeling is that we're this present piece of prose the bus in speed, it would be dangerously close to dropping below 50 miles per hour, and that's exploding. In a drenching pell mell momentum is easier to blather about than to maintain, in spite of the cup of tea, which I was hoping would fueler jamhuri of thrills and spills. That may be a lot to ask from a cup of tea. But it's been argued that generations of British troops could not have built an empire without their cups of tea. And I'm not trying to build an empire merely to write deathless prose, and perhaps millions, or thousands, or hundreds, or even just a pittance by so doing. Yet all the while the urge to cease and stare, not at the screen, but out of the window, that trees and crows grows evermore intense. What would Keanu do?

Frank Key  08:42
Yes, so, listeners will know. I think that this year, I've set myself the task of writing 1000 word essay every day, on the hooting yard website, and 61 days into the year there are 61 essays, so it's going pretty well. Some of them have actually been autobiographical, rather than fictional. In it name babbling. And this next one is entirely autobiographical. True story. I remember the Latin mass dimly, dimly, but I do remember it in all its mystery. It was perhaps made all the more unfathomable because until I was six or seven years old, we attended Sunday morning mass in a pub, not in a function room within a pub. But in the main bar area. Towels were draped over the beer pumps that are remember, and these were the only visits to a pub that my family made. Thinking back I must have found the world a very confusing place. At least on Sunday mornings, all smartly dressed, we would walk together to this big pub on a crossroad, where in a man in a black suit time would intone what must have struck me is jibberish. While performing slow, ritualistic maneuvers against the backdrop of a counter line with a row of unknown object hidden under towels, behind which was a glittering array of bottles and glassware. I remember that when mass ended, many of the parishioners and the priest remained behind, eager for the pub to open, but we're always left to go home. There was no Catholic Church on the Council of State where I grew up and I assumed the parish had persuaded the pub landlords to offer his premises to ensure our souls were saved. In my memory, I date the change to the vernacular mass, and the longer walk to the parish church proper, as happening at the same time, when I was six or seven. Last past forever, a curious feature of my childhood, I was old enough for it to have become a familiar, even reassuring routine, and recall a vague yet definite sense of disappointment with the new regime. I didn't mind the longer walk. It took us through a park with a playground than a duck pond and immense green well mowed lawns. But instead of the wood paneled gloom of the pub, mass now took place in a bright modern church and worth I could understand the words. All the mystery was leached out of my Sunday mornings. It took me a few years of that before one morning when I was 14. I woke up with the clear conviction the whole Catholicism hoo ha. Actually no, the whole religion who are with absolute twaddle. I've never seriously diverted from this view in the succeeding years, despite a couple of wobbles. My devout yet tolerant parents never made an issue of it never forced me to attend that ghastly, bright, modern church against my will. Though, I remember my father telling me with a strange admixture of the world weary and the smug that the day would come when I would return to the bosom of the church and re embrace the face of my childhood. Who knows, he may yet be proved right. I find myself wondering if my loss of faith, which really did seem to happen overnight, would have been quite so decisive, had the mask still been set in Latin? Had we still celebrated it in the pub, there was something very seductive about those incomprehensible words, I would happily have swapped the pub for a church that was old and stony and cold and gloomy. But knowing the sense of what the priest was saying, and what I was bitten to respond, was fatal. The name of the pub was the Moby Dick. It's still there on the crossroads. Not so long ago, I passed it on the way to somewhere unconnected with my childhood. And I was pleased to note for the first time but also for the first time, consciously checking that the hyphen in the title of the novel is present and correct in the name of the pub. Just as George Orwell's 1984 is often given as the numerals 1984. So Moby Dick loses its hyphen to my minor irritation.

Frank Key  13:42
When tiny and attending mass, I was, of course, wholly ignorant of Herman Melville's a novel. It was not among the many, many books on the shelves at home, a huge number of books, the possession of which I thought was commonplace, until I grew a little older, and learned that most of our neighbors on the state had no books at all. But I did know that Moby Dick was a whale for so it was depicted, whitened thrashing about in the sea on the pub sign. I can't remember how old I was when I learned of the existence of the book, though I do recall as a teenager buying a copy, I still have the penguin edition bulked out with Harold beavers, remarkable critical operators, which is almost as long as the novel itself. Years passed before I actually got around to reading it. And I read more of Melville before I read Moby Dick. Which, of course, if I'm to insist on the hyphen, I should also take care to give its proper title, Moby Dick, or the whale. And when I typed that last word, it reminded me all of a sudden that the name of the road on which the pub is situated. One of the four roads meeting at the crossroads is whalebone lane. I have no idea what possible connection there is between this road rode far from the sea and Wales or whaling? No doubt I could find out. I do know Incidentally, that close by for many years lived Eva Hart 1905 to 1996, one of the longest living survivors of the sinking of the Titanic. There's a local pub named after her too.

Wasn't to doll that real life memoir about let's move on to something else. Briefly to remind you to go and visit the hooting yard website and to buy some books, or make a donation or even take out a subscription. And there's millions of words for you to read. Should you so wish. I wish I could remember where I saw it. I remember distinctly that it said, Now get quadruple points. The writing was in big bold, bright block capitals read I think there was an accompanying graphic and some smaller print, which it might have been a good idea for me to have read as it is, not only do I not remember where I saw it, I have no idea what I need to do to get the quadruple point nor indeed, what I might do with them if I got them. I just remember the blazoned promise so urgent, so life changing. It's not that I'm particularly seeking to change my life. At the moment, I'm reasonably content. But there was something about the big bold, bright block capital words that gave me pause, not sufficient polls, admittedly, to pay attention to the graphic and to read the smaller print. What lodged in my head was the thought that right now, I was being offered the chance to quadruple my points. Only a fool would walk away. So I suppose I must be a fool for walk away I did, either literally, if I saw it on a holding while traipsing the street or figuratively, if I saw it on one of those advertising leaflets that fall out of magazines, and which one tosses into the wastepaper bin having barely glanced at. If only I could remember, I could retrace the same streets or rummage in the bin. But there again, perhaps I saw it in another context entirely. I'd feel even more of a fool fruitlessly, traipsing or rummaging in pursuit of what after all, might be a shimmer. For what are the points I can increase fourfold? Do I already have some? What would be the implications of having four times more than I already have? If the points are redeemable, as I understand some points are then having four times as many is clearly going to be a good thing. For the more points I have, the greater their redeemable value in any coherent universe. It hardly matters what they're redeemable against, if against is the word I'm looking for, which I think it is. If it turned out that my points were redeemable against something of no worth to me. Still, I could barter them with another point possessing person who might be overjoyed to be able to redeem his points for whatever you go or frippery, I had turned my nose up at. If only I knew the precise nature of the points I was being offered the chance to quadruple. I almost wrote the once in a lifetime chance for who knows if I will ever see those words. That promise ever again. In all my days. I rule my ignorance. rude. Rude, rude. That's me. I know so little about the point that I don't even know if I already have some. But that's the inference, isn't it of the wording, get quadruple points, unless one starts with four points of the minimum. But that doesn't quite make sense. It's as easy as pie to think of situations or circumstances with three, two, or even a single point. Consider, for example, a cathedral city with a majestic pointy stapler, topic Cathedral. That might be the only point in the city. If say the remainder of its architecture is rounded and blunt and I'm pointing Such a city is conceivable, though off the top of my head, I can't think of a concrete example. Equally conceivable is the idea that if the burgers of the city took up the opportunity to get quadruple points, they might find themselves commissioning an architect to design three more buildings with pointy tops, or the cheaper option, install three pointy lightning rods here and there across the city that's increasing its pointedness fourfold at a swoop. If they then quadruple their points again, they'd have 16 points. And if they quadrupled them again 64 points. And if they quadrupled them again 256 points, at which point the mind or at least my mind begins to boggle

Frank Key  20:51
carry on like that, and you're in pointy town territory. Perhaps that's akin to the process by which pointy town became the point is town on Earth. It can't Of course began with a pointy steepled Cathedral, for a cathedral would confer city status usually, and for all it unfathomably numerous points. Points your town remains is proud to remain a town. But by all that is holy, is it pointy. There have been several surveys of the town in recent decades, and none has been able to find even a smidgen of bluntness or roundedness, or anything remotely resembling an pointedness. Each and every one of the surveyors has been defeated in their attempts to come up with a definitive count of the pointy bits in pointy town. So we cannot say if the total number is a multiple of four, I would like to think it is. But alas, I'm never going to know. I did off my own back, try to count the pointy bits by studying images of pointy town on Google Earth, pointy version bita, taking the resolution as high as possible, to the point where steam was hissing out of my computer. But somewhere around the two and a half million mark, my counting was interrupted by a god awful din outside my window, where a cat and a crow and a squirrel were engaged in some kind of bestie or concrete on being a fool, as reluctantly I've already admitted to, I haven't been keeping a tally of the pointy bits of pointy town with a butcher's pencil on graph paper, which is what I would have done if I was no fool. So I'd have had to start counting all over again. And quite frankly, I decided I had better things to do with my time, what those things might be holy for you to wonder about.

Listen, listeners will know that whenever I'm a little loss or feeling, feeling low, I always turn to the same book. It's a book. I've read parts of it on the show before it's a book called further science book 20. written and published by Norman Davis in 2001. It's a 76 page spinalis a six booklet with a yellow card cover. And it contains a series of basically a series of numbered lists on topics including hedge orders, dragonflies, World monkeys, near death, world flag psychology and national bill hooks. Wonderful stuff, and it always cheers me up. So here, here to end this week's show is Norman Davis. on well with a local recipe map one, far northeast Scotland, marmalade, far northwest biscuits, far north fish to mid southwest to northeast, Devin Yorks, rolls, cheese, sausage, cheese. Three, so that about a Midlands triangular pine nucleus. There are fingers and eggs, hot pots to the northwest marmalade ham loaf to the east with a ginger Northwest Apex for tart to the south, with West East in the far south, dumplings and Welsh Herbes cake, fish puddings and scons etc.

Frank Key  26:40
One more thing. I can't actually remember if I read this last week, so if I did, I apologize. But it's very good. It's I think I did you know, this is about Thomas Allen, who was a 17th century astrologer. And in in in the account of his life in brief lived brief lives by john Aubrey Aubrey writes, in those dark times, astrologer, mathematician and conjurer were accounted the same things. And the Volga did very believe Thomas Allen to be a conjurer. He had a great many mathematical instruments and glasses in his chamber, which did also confirm the ignorant in their opinion and his servitor to impose on freshmen and simple people will tell them that sometimes he should meet the spirits coming up his stairs, like bees. What I find curious about that extract is, what on earth? What is that something that happened often in his house that bees would come up the stairs? Interesting. Perhaps they did. He had bees in his attic. One other thing I should point out very briefly before we go, is that if you're in any doubt, when he talks about the triangular pie nucleus, Norman Davis does mean pie, as in, you know, pork pie or something pie with it with me on the end, not the mathematical symbol for pie. So there isn't a triangular pie nucleus and I think we should pay a visit to that one day. That's the end of the show for this week. Hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye.
