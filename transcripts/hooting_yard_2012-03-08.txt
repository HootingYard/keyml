Excuse me Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And the LORD came onto the plains of gas and he was footsore, having walked for many days without rest. And he sat him down upon one of the tasks which grow upon the plains of gas. Then there came a widow woman driving before her a goat. And the goat was thin and bony and off Titanic mean. And the LORD said unto the widow, woman, woman, I am your Lord and I am footsore. Having walked for many days without rest. I have great thirst, suck up, succor me with milk from your goat, this icommand thereupon, the widow woman did stop upon her journey, and she tied her goat with a halter to a post that was stuck fast in the earth, upon the plains of gas. And she sat down upon the tasik next to the Lord, and took from her pouch, an infusion of Herbes and roots, all rolled in the leaf of a frixion gear shrub. On one end of this, she ignited with fire from heaven, and she breathed in the fumes thereof. My goat is old, and tired, and thin and Boney, and has no milk to give, said the widow woman. Then now shall roast in the pits of hell for eternity, said to the Lord. But before the Lord could make good his threat, there came passing upon the plains of Gath several more widow women, some with goats, and some with widow's mites. And the Lord was sort of frighted then the widows all together, began a keening and a caterwauling, and made so mighty a din, that the Lord placed his hands over his ears. And the goats did join in Bing. And the widow's mite stood join in buzzing. And so great was the racket of the keening and the brain and the buzzing, that the sun itself crumbled, and hid, and darkness fell upon the plains of Gath. Then, from out of the darkness, there came a minstrel, toiling across the plains of Gath. And when he came upon the Lord, and the widow women and the goats and the widow's mite, he did stop, and he placed his and Leia upon the ground and listened. And when, after many hours passed, and the hubbub ceased, the minstrel did speak unto the widow women. Women, I have come far, for I am of a brutish, Germanic tribe, a stranger in the plains of gas. I am a minstrel, but I have put aside my liar, for I am bewitched, by the din of your keening and caterwauling, and the breaking of your goats, and the buzzing of your widow's mite. Come, follow me on the long journey back to the tenebrous Teutonic forest from whence I came, that you might keen and caterwaul and Bray and bars to my tribes, people for your racket will be as bow to their ears in the land of improv. But before the widow women could follow them in struggle from that place, the Lord rose up from his tosic and with great fury, he shouted, is there not one among you who will give succor to your Lord in His grievous state, upon the plains of gas in the darkness and there was silence And then the sun did reappear, flooding the plains of Gath with light and close by the tasik. a fountain burst forth from the soil, shooting a jet of pure bubbling water high into the air.

And the Lord did stand beneath it with his head up turned, and his mouth open, and he drank of the water. And when he was sighted, he took his rod and his staff, and began to smite the widow women and the goats and the minstrel in terrible rage. But the widow's mite were too tiny, and they bust away from the scene of the smiting they bust to a cluster of hearts. And they bounced to a cluster of hearts just beyond the horizon, where they lived a sack trap and his minions. And hearing the buzzing of the widow's mite, the satrap and his minions took up their clubs and their staves and their sticks. And they did rush like flies across the plains of gas to the tatak, where the Lord was in a great frenzy. And that lie of the minstrel, like shattered and broken upon the ground. And the sand trap and his minions did set upon the Lord with all their might. And when he was bashed senseless, they carried him away across the plains of gas to their cluster of hearts, where they locked him up in Jordans vile. And the widow women and their goats did lick their wounds and dust themselves down, and they were joined by the widow's mite, and they did follow the minstrel on a long journey to the tenebrous Teutonic forests, where they did Keane and Cata wall and Bray and buzz and bewitch the tribes people of improv, yay onto every generation. And in his dungeon, in a cluster of hearts upon the plains of gas, the Lord did bear whale his fate. And there came on to him an angel, saying, Lord, I am an angel sent by another greater Lord than the I come from home so cute and Hearn. I make a sudden Sally, and sparkle out among the fern to bicker down a valley. It is the valley of the shadow of death, and the valley along which you must walk unless you buck your ideas up. I shall fling open the doors of your prison, if you will but pledge to crawl upon your belly, across the plains of gas and beyond, all the way to the far remote tenebrous cratonic Forest there to seek forgiveness from the widow women and their goats and their widow's mites. And from the minstrel do as I command and when again they keen and caterwauling Brian bars, place not your hands over your ears, but stand upon a podium and wave a baton. And your eyes shall glint and your Lankan greasy Kratos will become as a Buffon and you will be called Maestro. And the Lord did as he was bid by the angel, and he took himself upon his belly to improv in olma. Here endeth the lesson

it occurred to me after writing that piece, which I wrote earlier today, that term a Bray is the noise that we associate with a donkey. And I'm not sure I can't for the life of me think what noise and goats makes. So the goats in that story braid. I'm sure there might be another word. So if anyone knows, perhaps I could let me know. Anyway, enough of that. Our bongos inherently groovy. It's a good question. There are countless examples of the addition of bongos to a lineup by those desperate to impart grooviness to their combos. So Time's it succeeds incontrovertibly as in the transformation wreaked overnight when Claude Grimes and his pulsating rhythm orchestra became groovy, Claude Grimes and his pulsating rhythm orchestra with bongos. It's important to note, however, that though the pulsating rhythm orchestra itself became incredibly groovy, Claude Grimes himself did not. He was a straight laced and somewhat starchy figure upon whom the mantle of grooviness never sat comfortably, and it would have been better for all concerned had he dubbed the new lineup, either, Claude Grimes and his groovy pulsating rhythm orchestra with bongos or Claude Grimes and his pulsating rhythm orchestra with groovy bongos. Either of those would have been accurate, felt like we're grooviness incarnate with added bongos. Yet for all that grooviness if you could hear it when they were distracted by the patent absurdity of stiff and fashionably dressed Claude Grimes trying to pass himself off as groovy. That is why shortly after the bongos were added the combo retired from live performances and kept to the recording studio, where they could give vent to their newfound grooviness uninterrupted by hepcat hooting ridicule straight Claude Grimes no one listening to those scratchy old 78 today could dispute just have groovy they are and how that grooviness reaches its Apogee in the bongos but twelves not ever Vass at around the same time as Claude Grimes was haunting the lobbies of talent agencies on the lookout for a Bongo player. Another band leader Pook tanks had the same idea. One might think that with a name like Pook tanks, he had quite enough grooviness to be going on with because it's by any measure a groovy name. It was of course a pseudonym taken from an 1864 entry in the Journal of Gerard Manley Hopkins, where the Victorian Jesuit poet wrote tanks is a good name. Gerard Manley tanks, Pook tanks but Pook tanks the bandleader was on a mission to become ever groovier. Almost 100 years after Hopkins in 1954, he wrote in his own journal. I have it in me to become the grooviest person ever to bestride the earth. By my own reckoning. I'm currently at a high level of greatness. I need to screw my courage to the sticking place and take certain steps to become even groovier. My spies tell me that Claude Grimes is planning to add bongos to the lineup of his combo. Even though he is laughably on groovy, there is no doubt that he will impart grooviness to his pulsating rhythm orchestra. By doing so. He will be hot on my heels. If I'm to propel myself further into the stratosphere of grooviness and leave Claude Grimes are barely visible speck in the far distance. I too must have bongos in my lineup. Pook tanks and is happening sounds of fantasticness must become groovy Pook tongues and is happening sounds of fantasticness with bongos or bat Pook tongues that is happening sounds of groovy fantasticness with bongos. So Pook tanks to haunted the very same lobbies of the very same talent agencies in the shadow of Claude Grimes and within days of the latter snapping up a groovy Bongo list.

So to did Pook tanks. At least he thought his bonga list was groovy. Most Bongo this star but fatally Pook tanks plucked the wrong bongos from the pile. classically trained with many a certificate and diploma hanging in frames on the walls of his bungling room. The new recruit was simply unable to get the hang of the happening. Sounds of fantasticness so dizzyingly played by the combo. A test entry in poke tanks his journal is smudged with tears. He's been going isn't leaden, he wrote. Ironically, then the decidedly on groovy Claude Grimes was celebrated for the groovy of his combo, at least after they retired to the studio, whereas the ones impeccably groovy Pook tongues lost every atom of grooviness he ever had. And the impetus behind these divergent trajectories was bongos. What we can learn from this is that contrary to received wisdom, bongos are not inherently groovy. Other factors have to be taken into account. For one thing, the demeanor, attitude and aptitude of the Bongo list are critical. No one becomes groovy just by something a pair of bongos. Even though the bongos may be groovy in themselves, much less does the bandleader automatically Baskin reflected grooviness? Simply by dint of adding bongos to the lineup, a certain alchemy has to occur whether the bongos are added to pulsating rhythms or happening sounds of fantasticness a groove ologists recently posited the intriguing question of what might have happened had Claude Grimes recruited Pook tunxis Bongo list and Pook tongues. Claude Grimes his arrival groove Allah just made the compelling point that the pivotal factor may be the bongos not the Bongo list. Had Claude Grimes Bongo is swapped his bongos with Pook tunxis Bongo list, could that have made a vital difference? This takes us into the treacherous territory of whether the groove in us or otherwise of bongos depends upon the Bongo list, which in turn forces us to ask if the grooviness or otherwise of any individual Bongo list is reliant upon their bongos. In an ideal world, of course, one could match up groovy bongos with groovy bongos while they're still loitering full of hopes and dreams in the lobby of a talent agency. But even then, can the grooviest of Bongo just armed with the grooviest of bongos necessarily impart grooviness to the combo to which they're recruited? The tragic decline of Pook tanks and is happening sounds of fantasticness into the groovy where one will would suggest not. He was last seen in 1962. In the gutter outside the Cavern Club in Liverpool sloshed and stricken and holding out her begging boulder trendy with it young persons who passed him by neither knowing nor caring who he was.

I'm continuing on a musical theme, which we seem to have developed during this show. Without me thinking about it. There was an amusing letter in The Guardian today from Gavin bryars. The composer who lives apparently in Bilson in Leicestershire, and Gavin bryars wrote to the guardian to say the following. Having written a piece of music based on the sinking of the Titanic, unlike perhaps be lumped with the Titanic tracks, about home there was an article in The Guardian the other day. Inevitably, this 1969 piece is being performed several times this year. Recently, a young Belgian composer contacted me to ask if his composition on the subject might be performed alongside mine in his country. His piece is written from the point of view of the iceberg. Now, I don't know if Gavin Ross is making that up. But I think that's that sounds like a splendid, splendid piece of music. Perhaps it includes cleaning and caterwauling and braying and buzzing but the sinking of the Titanic from the point of view of the iceberg, certainly well worth listening out for. One of the most unlikely stars of the golden age of the variety theatre was the monologue aced Zoltan Griffey. His monologue delivered in a booming robotic monotone when the tourists for going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, and on and on. Audiences listened as if spellbound as he told anecdotes devoid of interest or incident or rhythm, or punch lines, or anything remotely worth listening to about topics such as drains and straw, and wind swept coastal headlands and emus and rotting deer and porches and crumpled paper and tin foil and Kappa Kaylee's and Wells Fargo, and dust and cruise ships and pin cushions and slime and tofu and mental aberrations and hopelessness and armoires and corporate sponsorship, and the great dismal Maroons and hens and albinos and grease and tongue twisters and woodland sprites and goats and hats and court jesters and plumpness and ostriches and Vainglory and canned fruit and ampersand and driftwood and macadamia nuts, and the chosen one, and balconies, and thirst and gravel and designated smoking zones and vodka and shrimps and antimony and the naming of race horses and the old rugged cross and the Munich air disaster and Rumpelstiltskin and shadows, and grains and misanthropy and carrots, and podcasts, and squeegee merchants and domes and the lives of the saints and putting things in alphabetical order and dis arranging them so they were no longer in alphabetical order and rearranging them into quote a YUI op order. And this arranging them again. And tracking them all out of the window one by one. And watching as they plummeted to Earth hundreds of feet below, some landing on the unprotected heads of pedestrians causing injury and in some cases death.

And then hearing the sirens of both ambulances and police cars and the thumping of boots on the staircase. And the urgent pounding at the door before it was bashed in with mine forced by a SWAT team and gristle and pangs and knitting needles and sin and egg yolks and bolts of cloth and handy artists and the river Nile and shabbiness and gumption and freaks and pictures of jack girls in synthesis. And you want to know what happened after the SWAT team bash the Dorian and slovenliness and ink patterns and swamps and sowing circles and spelling bees and bees and castor sugar and swimming pools and Canada and college and slaughter and being placed under arrest and dragged down to the police station and interrogated at length and donkeys and volcanoes and imps and frost and soap and brooms and figs and den and hedges and ergot poisoning and orchards and swollen rivers and check stubs and ornithology and vinegar and lapis lazuli and supermarkets and boll weevils and champions and mustaches and confessing to the whole kitten caboodle and entering a plea of befuddled stupidity, and sandalwood and concussion and drip dry laundry and goblins and chalk and power stations and a pop an X and brutes and gas. A genuflection on full stop, full stop. Dammit I said full stop. those in the audience who remained awake could sometimes discern exalt and Goofy's interminable monologues, scattered snatches of autobiography. He would appear on stage in his top hat and anorak and pantaloons and mountaineering boots, and begin to speak, or rather to drone, and he would go on and on and on and on and on and on, and on and on about jogs, and clipper ships and monkeys and nobility and the love of that dare not speak its name, and overcoats, and paleontology and scrimshaw and buttered dishes and insignificance and border guards and waste shoots and palimpsest and sharks and litmus paper and hogs and shelving units. And the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe on target practice on mothballs, and sticky bands, and enamel and detergent, and clementines and Pope Joan and fan Farren odds and distemper and jam roly poly, and moistness, and barbarism, and carpets and despair, and geese and plums, and Thunderbirds and axolotl, where they would all of a sudden say something about arranging large heavy objects into alphabetical order and then dis arranging them and rearranging them into quote a ue or border, a dis arranging them again, and tossing them one by one out of a high window in a fit of befuddled stupidity, and the audience would pick up their ears and listen more carefully, as a coherent story promised to emerge from the prattle. Adult I'm Jiffy with tantalized them by going on to relate the sound of boots stamping hurriedly up the staircase, and a pounding at the door, and then the door being bashed in, and being taken into custody and interrogated, and making a plea of befuddlement and stupidity. And then, just as the audience were desperate, not desperate, let's say mildly intrigued, in a casual way to find out what happened next, he would revert to babbling in consequentially about tax inspectors and pomposity and grime and card games and rhubarb and Frankish kings and cavemen and ballooning and mistletoe, and the Seven Dwarves and kobolds and linctus and marmalade and foreigners and bedsteads and cornflakes and partridges and scooters and rabbits and operatic tenors and boarding passes and flailing and reprehensible behavior, and the smell of cordite and raft and snow storms and anchors and bosom crumbs and eglantine and wait for it, wait for it. Time for a full stop.

Frank Key  28:00
It's sort of what kept the audience's flocking to us all time trophy shows was the hope that sooner or later they would tease from him something crew and human, some exciting story of his attack of befuddled stupidity, and the dropping onto the heads of passers by of large, heavy objects and his arrest of interrogation and his plea. And then they hope, though, how hard they hoped for the aftermath to be told what happened next, but it's a small mercy that he never did tell them. had he done so they would have learned that just like the monologue just they too, were incarcerated forever in a bleak grim home for the befuddled in the stupid and would remain there for the rest of their lives. To spend hour upon hour day in and day out, listening to Zoltan Jiffy prattling on and on and on and on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
