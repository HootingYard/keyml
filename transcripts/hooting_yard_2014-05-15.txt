You're tuned to resonance 4.4 FM, the art of listening.

Good evening, this is Rosalind swallow 4.4 FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. You would do well to remember, if ever you're out walking in the vicinity of the farmyard, or screen hunahpu that you may come face to face with the fainting goat. If you encounter it on the lying, leaving out of the farmyard towards the orchard, and as soon as it sees you it topples over in a swoon. You must not be alarmed, you must certainly not think that the goat has fainted because you have caused it fright by dint of something alarming in your appearance. Even if there is something terrifying about you, such as a twisted up face or two brightly colored clinkard jacket or you're being armed with a mailorder mannlicher carcano snipers rifle. None of these things will be what causes the goat to find. The goat will faint for the reason it is known as the fainting goat, which is that it's constantly fainting dozens of times a day, even dozens of times an hour. This constant swooning is a mystery as far as the local vets are concerned, there are several vets with practices in walking or short bus journey distance of screwin hunahpu farmyard, and all of them at one time or another, have been called to tend to the fainting goat. They have tried all sorts of treatments from goat friendly smelling salts, to the deployment of Peruvian whistling vessels, so simply shouting very loudly into the goats there, and those such techniques may revive the goat from type from its faint. None have served to stop it clattering over in a dead swoon again and again. As the long countryside day draws on towards dusk and rainfall. When it is when it's conscious, the goat seems Hale and hathi even frisky, and engages in all the normal activities you might expect to the farmyard goat. I would list these activities, but I'm sure you're thoroughly up to speed with the doings of goats, given the demographics of the hooting yard listenership. There has been a certain amount of bickering among the local vets, as each of them grows frustrated at their inability to stop the continual fainting of the fainting goat. When I passed out of their veterinary colleges, they were all brimming with confidence, armed as they thought, with the knowledge and expertise to handle all sorts of bestill maladies from the worker day to the exotic, whether it be a cow with a pox or an ostrich beset by von straubing disease gruesomeness. These vets believed they could march into a farm yard or Menagerie and with the undying gratitude of farmers and menagerist and when the undying gratitude of farmers and menagerist by waving that weaving their vetti spells an injection here a siphoning off of fluid there until the gasps of their keepers, the cow or ostrich or whatever beast it may be, would leap up restored to vigor, and there would be a round of applause and the discreet passing of banknotes into the pocket of the smart vet. But the fainting goat goes on fainting day in day out, and not one of the vets has a clue what to do about it. When they gather have an evening on the balcony of the cafe Simon Sharma. At first they boast of their breakthroughs, the splint affixed to the leg of the sparrow. The gunk drain from the Badgers boils, the palsy pig poems IID. But as they sit there fermented slops, tempers fray and the talk soon turns to the fainting goat that damned in tractable fainting goat and harsh words are said and there is spitting and tracking and fisticuffs, black eyes and bruises and the odd daggers slash. And so it goes on night after night.

Now curiously enough, during the night, the fainting goat never faint. It remains wide awake all night every night, either in its comfy pen or out in some field, doing doty things, things other goats do in daylight. apprised of this singular information. Some have posited that the goat swoons or not swoons so much as it's repeatedly falling asleep from exhaustion. It is indeed a cogent case. But it's nevertheless mistaken for reasons crystal clear to those such as some among the vet who have made studies of the goat neurological peculiarities. it sleeps not yet it faints. The Wild is understood unexplicable the other not. There are more curious cases among the goat population as among other farmyard beasts, but not many Sure enough, that's why the vets fret so. But you will not fret Will you as you wander past grune hunahpu farmyard on your way to the orchard, to pluck persimmons from the trees illegally, and you come upon the fainting goat upon the path and it faints at your feet. You will pass it so little horns and lift it to its feet and send it tottering off along the line to it next collapse, for you are wiser than the vet. You are wiser than the farmer. The only thing wiser than you is the fainting goat itself. No goat was ever wiser, nor had some explosive a brain

because it was constructed mostly from Canvas and cloth, and the canvas and cloth were fed on by mouth. The Temple of Hoon fat Gar, is sometimes known as the moth eaten Temple of Hoon fact Gar, ravaged by moths and time and lashed by wild winds that blow across the top pooter. It is a wonder the temple still stands. 1000 years after the first devotees entered it through the sacred flap. It has of course been much patched and stitched over the centuries, and it's fabricated, regularly stiffened with Stark carried in canisters for miles upon miles by worshipers of the hideous back God fatso. For it is he to whom the temple is dedicated? The Wild winds that lakshan batter the temple are meteorologically very interesting. Indeed. Students of the weather have been perplexed by them. Ever since modern white wild wind studies began before our scientific age, of course, the sheer weirdness of the winds that blow across the top hooter was ascribed to the Mercurial and petulant nature of the hideous back God fatso, for it was thought that he was responsible for them as he was for everything in the universe. We are wiser now, but no closer to getting to grips with the wild, lashing winds. Those who still believe in fat, so have a simple explanation. for them. The winds are the physical manifestation of the temperament as fat sews magic pig. Actually, he has two magic pigs, but we can safely ignore one of them for a moment or two. The idea is that this particular pig, which must be understood is not a real pig in any sense, somehow sends the winds howling across the top pooter whenever it is fractured. Or hungry or obstreperous, or mad and, or otherwise out of sorts. Why the hideous bad God fatso does nothing to placate his magic pig is an ineffable mystery. The religion dedicated to him is short on theologians of any stripe. Although one of the few to have addressed the problem, contended that fatso spent much of his time pacifying the other magic pig, which, if ever fully awakened, would make the wild winds that batter the temple seemed like tiny pipsqueak gust of summer breeze. Other so called scholars argued that this implied the other magic pig was somehow more powerful and fatso himself a clear heresy. So the first theologian was put in a Crusher and crashed. There used to be at least five crushers on the mud playing around the temple of Hoon, fat Gar, so we must assume that there were plenty of heretics to be crushed. Occasionally, a bright young whippersnappers archaeologist will announce plans for a dig at the site, hoping to exude a fantastical horde of crushed bones. But not one of these schemes ever succeed.

Frank Key  11:35
It is said that fatso himself, sabotages the expeditions by causing shipwrecks and helicopter crashes and by tickling the archaeologist brains while they sleep. In these ploys, he calls on the assistance of his flock of bitterns. Unlike the two pigs The buttons are not magical, but nor, of course, are they real? They're Phantom spectral veterans beholden to fat, so for some service, he did them in the distant past. We cannot guess what that might have been. For. It's a topic suspiciously neglected by all the priests and wizards and jumping about men who interpret fatso to his followers. Or I should say, who used to do so. There are none of them left alive today, at least none that we know of. believers in fact, so we're a dwindling band, often greasy and myopic and spindly and gormless. They tend to lack Erlang. Most of them probably would be crushed in the crashes if the crashes were still there. Because one thing we can be quite clear about the hideous back God facto is that he expected His devotees to cut a dash. There may have been few opportunities for glittering social panache on the prehistoric tar pooter especially with those wild wins. But what rare chances there were were seized on by fat those followers. Great attention was paid to the angles of hat, the tying of cravat and affectations of toffee nosed insouciance. This is not to discount a comment and yearning for the mud encouraged by one of the magic pigs. So today, there are a few who haul their canisters of stock for miles and miles to stiffen the moth eaten canvas and cloth of the temple of Hoon, fat Gar. Perhaps in 100 years, there will be none at all. Yet fatso himself will still as far as he is concerned, hold sway over the universe, and his magic pay grow Mike the wild winds blow and his other even more frightening magic pig will doze and slumber dreaming of havoc. It's easy for us to dismiss their very existence. Until that is, we have struggled stylishly across the inhospitable top pooter and stooped down to crawl through the sacred flap to enter the temple. Then we see what all those believers through the century saw a site so magnificent and terrifying, that we sprawl helplessly in the mud, shrieking brains bit dies and Gaga for the gold of all gold

In 1946, Sylvia Townsend Warner superbe novelist and archetypal posh upper class communist she, one of the things about Sylvia Townsend Warner is that when a lot of other British communists left the party after the invasion of Hungary in 1956, and the Khrushchev's speech, about starlin many British communist left Sylvia Townsend Warner thought they were Lily livered wretches, and she just became even more devoted to Uncle Joe, as she called him. Of course, she was also She was the daughter of a housemaster harrows school and incredibly posh. Anyway, but she was a great novelist and in 1946, just before Christmas, she received a Christmas present from her friend Annie's Gregory and it was an empty match box. And this is Sylvia Townsend Warner's thank you letter dated the 23rd of December 1946. Dearest Elise, usually one begins the thank you letter by some graceless comparison, by saying, I've never been given such a very Scarlet muffler or this is the largest horse I've ever been sent for Christmas. But your matchbox is a nonpareil a for never in my life, have I been given a matchbox stamps? Yes. Drawing pins? Yes. Balls of string? Yes. Yes, menacingly too often, but never a matchbox. Now that it's happened, I asked myself why it's never happened before. There's such charming things neat as Rennes and what a deal of ingenuity and human artfulness has gone into their construction. For if they were like the ordinary box with a lid, they would not be one half so convenient. This one though, is especially meat, charming, and ingenious. And the tray slides in and out as like Chippendale had made it. But what I like best of all about my matchbox is that it's an empty one. I've often thought how much I should enjoy being given an empty house in Norway, what pleasure it would be to walk into those bare wood smelling chambers, walls, floor ceiling, all wood, which is after all, the natural shelter of man, or at any rate, the most congenial. And when I opened your match box, which is now my match box, and saw that beautiful, clean, sweet smelling empty, rectangular expanse, it was exactly as though my house in Norway had come true. With the added advantage of being just the right size to carry in my hand. I shut my imagination up in it instantly, and it's still sitting there listening to the wind in the Fernwood outside, sitting there. In a couple of days time. I shall hear the Lutheran Bell calling me to go and sing Lutheran hymns, while the pastor's wife gazes abstractedly at her husband in a bout of evergreen, while she wonders if she remembered to put pepper in the goose stuffing. But I shan't go. I shall be far too happy sitting in my house that at least gave me for Christmas. Oh, I must tell you I finished my book began in 1941 and 100 times in parallel, but finished it last, so I can give an undivided mind to enjoying my maxbox yours Silvia. PS, there's still so much to say. carried away by my delight in form and texture. I forgot to praise the picture on the back. I've never seen such an agreeable likeness of a hedgehog or the volcano in the background is magnificent.

Before we go on, if you were listening to pull the plug, john would have told you that next week, resonance, or much of resonance is at the Science Museum. And among the shows at the Science Museum will be heading out on the air. So we'll be on, I'll be on at the earlier time of three o'clock. alive at the Science Museum. So if you want to come and drop, or I don't know, congratulate me or even press coinage into my hand, come to the Science Museum. I'll be on from three till 330 next week, and I think for the next three weeks after that. So I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say john, my engineer for an entire month unless we meet up somewhere else. So it's a good time to, on your behalf listeners thank him for his excellent service to this show over the years. It wouldn't happen without him. Well, it might, because resonance might just get someone else to come and sit there. But you know what I mean, some we all wish, we all owe him a debt of thanks, none more than me. So I thought I'd do that. Now. unattached. On the other hand, he's not going to be at the Science Museum, which I think is his says something about resonance which may need to be dealt with or may have to start a petition. Anyway, here's something else so next week, yeah, next week science museum. Three o'clock in the afternoon. Your a very sinister servant Baynes, said Lord bogguss addressing as he thought his manservant Baynes, by which I mean that having brought me my muffin and tap water at 11 o'clock on the.as instructed, you have been dismissed with a lordly gesture of my laundry arm, to return to the pantry, or to wherever it is, you hold sway in the bowels of this my mansion, there to go about your duties, whatever they may be, while you are out with my presence, running a tight ship, awaiting the sound of the bell which calls you back upstairs. Next time I require your services. And yet, having been dismissed, you have not gone but it'll be found lurking in the corner of the room in shadow, barely visible, betraying your presence by the faint outline of your frame and by the almost imperceptible sound of your breathing, which if I deploy my ear trumpet I can hear in goober tably this behavior is most untoward, and is quite likely to send me into what flap when you are dismissed by means you should go. When you are summoned you should come. I cannot countenance this intermediate state where you loiter, neither going nor coming, hovering as it were in an uncertain realm between tidy absolutes. Look, I have not touched my muffin nor dragged my tap water and this is 10 past the hour. That is evidence of my discombobulation I cannot rest while you were standing there sinister in shadow. You have been in service in this mansion for several decades Baines and never before have I known you to fracture my piece in so unprecedented a fashion even when you had that mishap with an icing sugar, siphon pump attachment, and have to have a metal plate inserted in your skull. Even then, and afterwards, you carried out your duties with aplomb. And I have no complaints to make that's I'm baffled baffled by your frankly bewildering conduct or other misconduct. It may be that you've taken a loopy turn, and will need to be carted off and replaced by a brand new manservant, though how in heaven I've ever defined one as reliable as you've been until now is quite beyond my wits to discover.

Frank Key  24:39
Loot Boggess prattled on not realizing that the sinister figure lurking in the shadows was not his trusted servant Baynes. No, it was the grumpy man and he was merely biding his time before laying waste to the mansion and every person in it

I should have coughed before coming back on air bashful Kok galosh trauma surgeon being the title of a novel by Maisie Pugh, Drew to be published in September. It's a book of 10 tractors, their titles being one, the Jelic night zombie person from Didcot, to putting time, three, paste then grool for our hero, Dr. slab goes haywire. Five being attracted in which lovecraftian shadows are experienced by a barnyard person and a ferocious bat being six toward grip. Seven the other gelignite zombie person from Didcot, ICT that send us L'Oreal toss of the hair performed by a pirate gang. Nine shoes, boots, string 12 mild peril fopp dilemma long term listeners and those with their wits about them may remember that that piece appeared on the hooting yard website 10 years ago yesterday, and may have been read on the radio roughly 10 years ago as well. And I don't think I've reread it in all that time. But contrary to my claim no such book was ever published. That's because I on my desktop and be Maisie Pew did not then and does not now exist. I made her up to. Of course, I could have written back for trauma surgeon said myself, and I may even have planned to I can't remember. I still could write it. I rather fancy it would be a pulpy potboiler. If I followed the practice of certain eminent pulp writers, I might be able to batch it out in a week or so. The thing to do would be to start typing and not fret too much about felicities of style and whatnot. Incidentally, for those of you who care about such matters, CoQ talaash in the title was a sort of proto hooting yard or proto pointy town. It was a fictional location, which was the setting for a few stories I wrote as long ago as the late 1970s, each of which featured Joseph bomb, Mr. bomb was stolen from the good soldiers fake by Yaroslav, Patrick, where he's mentioned just once in passing in, I recall a newspaper cutting where he's described as a brave driver of a train. My Joseph bond wrote a horse mounted upon which he arrived in cockcroft. In the first of the stories on a blistering hot day, I do not remember much else about these ancient texts, which are last last burned, I think in a frenzy, long, long ago. That's the end of this week's show. As I told you, I'll be back at the early time of three o'clock next week. Live from the Museum of Science. Bye bye
