Good evening pickers, this is the wild and crazy resonance FM or resonance 104 point four FM or resonance fm.com. My name is Frankie. This is hooting out on the air. And this is a government a point government related announcement. Bring in your chickens. At indoor poultry week, popped your chicken on that couch and patties little beak. It's actually not indoor chicken week it's indoor indoor poultry week, it's indoor poultry month. If you've got a chicken or a duck, or another pet, pet limit or a swarm, you got to keep it indoors. This is all part of a government plan to beat bird flu. And apparently if you see any dead or sick birds, you must immediately report them to the police. So that's that's what you should do. Moving on. One morning, a tiny email I woke from uneasy greens with a sense of tremendous urgency related to potatoes. She was based in Winnipeg at the time. I've had taken a room in a motel of undoubted seediness. I could not pinpoint the reasons for my sense of breathless urgency on that grim March morning. She wrote many years later in her memoirs, all I knew was potatoes had something to do with it. The heroic young adventurous as true to the Hulk the motel breakfast when it pegs style, egg and dough platter, sneaking out of a side entrance to avoid the man with the twisted lip, the front desk. The city was still new to her and we have yet to locate any of the potato related premises. She felt such a tremendous urgency to visit. She limped across the plaza to her rented booster car and threw off its tarpaulins in one elegant sweep. Tiny Enid had been practicing her elegant, sweeping arm movements for some weeks, and the superb elegance with which she swept the tarpaulin off the car won her a round of applause from a nearby line of patient pastry persons Queuing outside a pastry shop. Before revving up the engine of her booster car. Tiny Enid tramped over to the queue. She wanted to find out if she would sense an aura of potato urgency here, so close to her motel. It was possible after all, that among the pastries held by the pastry shop, could be pastries with a potato filling. Was that urgency that cracked her awake a premonition that a Winnipeg based criminal mad person had poisoned the potato pastries? If so, it would make sense for her to be bang on the scene, rather than having the speed around the city lost, unnerved, or not knowing quite what she was seeking, nor why. So many of the adventures of the tiny adventurous had begun from these moments of curious intuition. But it was still early in the day, and the pastry shop proprietor had not yet hoisted the shutters hence the cute tiny made with hopeless at small talk, and she was a last how to engage with the still clapping cue which was so impressed with the elegance of her sweeping arm movement.

She pulled her sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat down low and pretended an interest in pebbles pile close to the pastry shop shatters. If our instincts were correct, she must be first in to the shop when the shutters went up before a poor innocent widow peg light was found by a poisoned potato pastry pie. Tiny Enid was a girl of impeccable manners, and she flushed with shame in anticipation of having to push aside the unkempt, hobble the boy who was first in the queue, and who looked as if he had not eaten for a month. Luckily, as the pastry shop proprietor appeared with a hook on the end of a wooden pole with which by some shenanigans he hoisted the shutters there was a distraction over by the statue of prominent winnipeggers Elias Conklin, who had been the city's mayor in 1881. a swarm of killer bees appeared out of the blue and set upon a defenseless old woman wearing her widow's weeds. The mast buzzing of the bees was nauseatingly loud, and the reaction of the pastry shop queue was instantaneous. Even the starving hobby boy forgot his grumbling belly as the line broke up. sprinting over to the conquering statue, flailing impromptu be scarifiers our tiny heroine took the opportunity to sneak into the pastry shop. Something the proprietor in the guts with a girly bludgeoned, she incapacitated him with a few kicks to the head, swiftly located behind the counter every single piping hot pastry with a potato ingredient and stuffed a lot of them into a canvas sack. She dragged the sack over to her rented booster car trapped into the boot and sped away just in time. For the killer bees have been confounded. The widow woman was safe. And the patient pastry people were heading back to the pastry shop with coinage clutched in their fists. an hour or so later, having dumped the canvas sack of potato pastries into the river at the forks where the Red River meets the assiniboine and then driven around until she found Verdun Parkland. Tiny Enid slumped onto a tuffet dusted off a sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat and lit one of her high tar Paraguayan cigarettes. Soon she knew she would have to hunt down the criminal mad person and bash them about. But for now, the world would take a pause and she could sit on her tablet and smoke and watch the coot more hands for whom a willet peg pond with home.

I'd like to read you a little brief a very brief quotation now from the demon haunted world by the excellent Carl Sagan. And in this book, Mr. site the light Mr. Sagan tells us that according to Betty Hill, who was once abducted by aliens Betty Hill tells us that the pesky visitors from outer space quote, quote frequently helped themselves to some of the abductees belongings such as fishing rods, jewelry of different types, I glasses, or a cup of laundry soap. Unquote. Remember that next time you see a myopic angler festooned with rings and necklaces emerging from the launderette. You can make a citizen's arrest and carry it off to your secret underground lab. It does make you wonder why aliens want fishing rods, jewelry, spectacles, and particularly cups of laundry soap but they do

Return to win a peg. I am a janissa after an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg, I have a bucket and a mop and a bunch of keys. Sometimes I carry a screwdriver or a wrench or a hammer. My soul glows with a tremendous overwhelming love of Christ. As I patrol the corridors with my bucket and mop and keys, I often find myself importuned by one of the janitors. They Dart from looks and buttonhole me jabbering questions about janitor them. I display excessive sunlight say in human patients with these intemperate cleaning nitwit. Only very rarely do I smoked one of them with my hammer. It is often cold, cold, oh bitterly cold in winter peg in the factory, the radiators need regular bleeding. When I carry out this duty, I try to concentrate my mind on the blood of Christ, which was shed for me and for all sinners, even for the wannabe janitors, though they know it not. Sometimes I have to wipe the blood of a wannabe janitor for my hammer. I use an old frayed much stained rag, which I then rinse out under a spigot and peg up to dry. I have seen the face of Christ in this rag many times. Though I have been the janitor for untold years, I have never actually tasted the evaporated milk made in the factory. I have a horror of semi sweetened evaporated dairy product. by dint of a childhood trauma. There was a picnic in the blue forgotten hills, and a swarm of wasps. But more than that I cannot bring myself to say every now and then I might come upon a wasp. When patrolling the corridors, I sink to my knees and take out my pocket catechism and I comfort myself with the sacred words. Sometimes in spite of my prayers, I am so fearful of the wasp that I piddle in my pants, I rinse them under the spigot and pick them up alongside the blood soaked rag. I hide in a broom cupboard to conceal my semi nakedness until my pants are dry. On these occasions, I usually take off the rest of my clothing so I can more readily imagine myself Adam in Eden, there is a painting of a serpent on the wall of the broom cupboard. nunc Dimittis.

This next piece is from nine years ago, almost 10 years ago. So any topical references and it will be a bit out of date by now. And it also includes various sentences, phrases, words, strings of words or names, which were incorporated into the text by people who donated to resonance FM. As part of a fundraising drive, you will find out much more about that in February, when you will hear about nothing else. Anyway, this is a piece that was written for that reason. And I haven't I haven't re read it for nine or 10 years so I have no idea what's about to take place. It is unfamiliar to me as it is to most of you. is chaos was the headline in one of the newspapers last week. This followed a day when the unthinkable happened. a flurry of snow that settled for about 24 hours in the winter in Britain account. In the northern hemisphere, chaos indeed, or perhaps just the cold snap. It's true though that extreme or freakish weather conditions seems to be on the increase. There were tornadoes in London, Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami. Incidentally, let us take this opportunity to recall the name of a seismologist involved in lack of tsunami warnings. Waverley person. Now, it's been pointed out to me more than once that I'm hardly qualified to talk about extreme weather conditions. As the only other The only weather we get it hooting yard is rain, sometimes torrential, sometimes a drizzle, and this is true. What my critics fail to notice is that ensconced in a cabin somewhere over by ballista lane bypass, we have a superb forecaster. I speak of course of little Severin, the mystic badger when it comes to predicting the weather, little Severin is second to none. Not even to the BBC is magnificent Dan Corbett. If you have not watched Dan, visit the website. That's the weather for now and be amazed. Little Severin the mystic badger has not yet been blessed with a fan site on his own, but it can only be a matter of time. Before we go on, I want to make it absolutely plain that there is neither a job nor scintilla of truth, and the rumors that have been flying around. Little Severin did not pass through the cat flap to the afterlife. In any case, he would have assumed a cat flap and sort of more appropriate badger flap flaps for badgers and indeed for stoats, pigs, wild hogs, otters and Kirby's some of which are flaps to the afterlife, and some not easily available. For example from zip Nolan's flap Berry and bassoon clock shear. Little severance method of weather divination is simple yet brilliant. He is not known as the mystic badger for nothing. At various times of day or night, he emerges from his cabin and grumbles around in the muck, what badgers do then he goes back indoors, voila, those able to read the omens and portents of his scrambling, no weather tomorrow will bring rain downpour or drizzle. And not only that, but little Severin can predict more than just the weather. Few people are aware that he forecasts both the cod wars between Britain and Iceland, which lasted for 17 years. And the corned beef wars between Ireland and Argentina, which lasted 30 years, among many other world shaking events. As far as I'm aware, there has not yet been any organized events, or even Oregon Oh, sorry, Oregon, I was bearing in mind that a number of little severance predictions are retrospective for as his name implies, he is only little and mystic.

It is the mysticism which so upset Braithwaite that one time Busey companion of Clyde m nestra duggleby it was Braithwaite with his pipe, his face, his trees, his keys is resolved his cup, his roll on roll off, rim, fire fireman and that lip on him, the lip and the sculpted boy here. Braithwaite, who called into question the accuracy of little Severin, the mystic badges paws grumbling weather forecasts, but what is he known as quite empty nester duggleby, attested in court after the incident with the wheezing Scrivener, and the invalid PostScript font. He spent most of his time slumped in front of the radio, like some antediluvian beast listening distractedly, to the say guns, a long running cereal about husband and wife team Carlin Francoise and their thrills, spills, window sills and gas bills as they bring up their Papoose booboo. The show's theme tune features the Pappas booboo singing mine and metzen Zima, backed by an orchestra of masked banjos and ducks with electronic implants. Quite nestra hated the drama, but adored the music and hummed it as she went about her many and various janitorial doings in the town aquarium. It was a submerged aquarium, hewn out of the geological strata underneath the abandoned Zoo and it was really fun With weird tentacle aquatic beings, including squid. According to the aquarium guidebook, squid the mammals just like plants and clouds for the book have been compiled by zip Nolan he of the flat berry in a break from writing his pop more of a series of animal flap related thrillers such as creepy Rao and the Partridge flap, creepy Rao and the bat flap. And the million severing creepy Rao and the inevitable mystery of the Pentecostalism cormorant flap, which famously begins, rendered placid by the sickening stifle this cumbersome vision of britany looked like some spastic hound, a revolutionary Lolita trying in vain to calm my wayward reflexes. Quite was it accepted the commission to compile the god book is as much a mystery as one of his thrillers. He was no lover of Waterworld, and I'm not talking about the Kevin Costner film. Zip was a dry land sort of person, so much so that he avoided ponds and puzzles and made daily cracks all the way from this flat barium bassoon clock shear to consult with little several in the mystic badger about the weather, the weather, the weather, is the weather, rainfall, wild winds, ice chaos. Gouda stoop, and I hear a blir thunderstorms tornadoes for lightning slash and frost and winter sunlight. Dan Corbett and little Severin, the mystic badger

but I do know what this next piece is all about. It's all about a cow by Azhar. Old Russia had only one at a time. But now of course we have many of them, each with their own speciality, like patron saint. Traffic czars drugs czars respect czars. Every week some Bogarde government won't create yet another Zaandam such power. Apparently Blodgett used to be Azhar for a few weeks. It was a gorgeous summer afternoon, and he was putting the finishing touches to this sleek, excuse me.

I'll start again. Apparently, Blodgett used to bizarre for a few weeks. It was a gorgeous summer afternoon, and he was putting the finishing touches to his sleek, gas powered Uber pod, when one of those bug eyed government wants came prompting up the path out of nowhere. Blodgett put down his rag on a pile of other rags, deputies hairy hands into a tub of swarf. Eager and what the more one of the other rags from the pile, or perhaps on the one he had just dropped. He adjusted his lawn yet with exquisite daintiness and look the one over as if you were examining a beetle. Blodgett had history with wanks, as they say, and he was prepared for anything. You are Blodgett asked the wanke in a wonky monotone. Blodgett was tempted to call his lip, but he was still wearing a protective cotton dimity thing of his nose and mouth. So instead he nodded his assent. We need to appoint a cow buyers are announced the walk without preamble, and your name has been put forward. There is a modest stipend and an armband. Congratulations. If the wanke said anything else, his words were wasted, but he was drowned out by the sudden appearance of sweeping corncrakes. Blodgett ushered him out in blushing. Blodgett ushered him into his heart and put the kettle on. What does the job involve? he asked his booming voice only slightly muffled by the dimity thing. Oh, you know, just go and hang around cow buyers being sort of zary replied the wunc. What Blodgett was not told was that he was expected to send in daily report, including the massive names of the cows in each buyer he fell upon looming in his fist, broad jetty and weigh in the shadows and added difficulty with it all accounts he visited. seem to twinkle like stars in the heavens. His first report was sent back to him, his lovely handwriting virtually obliterated by comments and corrections, scribbled with an impossibly thick black magic marker pen. Blodgett wept that night. Huge convulsive sobs, racking his frame as he crouched next to the Uber pod. His second and third reports fared no better, so he stopped sending them and nothing happened. Each morning as dawn broke, he would dawn his cow buyer's armband and stride out towards yet another cow buyer of twinkling cows and loom Zahra Lee for hours upon end, before returning home to his soup and his fireside. No word came from the wunc for the one word his sweetheart and fled to a city of curious puddles and gigantic towers of granite, and he never again thought much about towers twinkling or otherwise. And after a few weeks, Norden Blodgett had put his cow buyers armband on his pile of rags, and soon it was smeared with four fieger just another Blodgett rag. PostScript. Six months later, blood gets hot was crushed by a stampede of twinkling cows. He was out at the time.
