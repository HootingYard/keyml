Good evening This is resonance 104 point four FM resonance fm.com. My name is Frank key. This is hooting yard on the air. And this is a catalogue of 53 birds. The godwit like Italo Calvino, the godwit has a seething hatred of cement. It has been known to borrow, prone to desperate sneezing the godwit choose dandy vines and lacks any sense of pottery. The one clump and extraordinary bird for one clump is best known for its habit of swooping upon film premieres attended by the likes of Cloris Leachman, Troy Donahue and tab Hunter, but not Tuesday, well. Third bird, the Quint. verkin gettering sepal, Vader wrote about Quint in one of his majestic cracked. Unfortunately, scholars have to date been unable to read any of them, as his penmanship was execrable Good luck wit. I emitted from most biographies of Ezra Pound, is the startling fact that he was an indefatigable crapper of luck with such with his mania that he was fired from the joint to us Italian lock with the monitoring committee in 1949. The tout. Sadly, the tout is an irrelevant bird. The frisky glip warheads a joy to behold a flock of frisky clips on the wing, as they set off on their annual migration from Penge to utakata. The smote the following is a quotation from Eric wheat notes on that bad man Dobson and some birds. I quote, this morning, on my way to church, I noted the nest of a smoke atop the timber framed heart, in which the malefactor Dobson plot is dark deed. The Nest was empty. Yet Upon my return from worship, it was absolutely crammed with innumerable sick lease notes. The charter the charter is able to mimic the sound of klaxons, sirens and toxins, but does not often do so. It feeds on do and flax the Arpad many top ornithologists contend that the Arpad is a kind of night job. Certainly its beak and wings give that impression. Our pads both inflight and roosting, has been a popular subject for recent postage stamps in Finland. The hoopoe, there are a number of interesting facts about the Hulu, a tiny bird much smaller than the Wren or even the hummingbird. The Hulu is as far as I know, the only bird which has magnetic feet. For this reason who goes avoid sites such as Ironworks, blacksmith, smelting yards, tin mines and other locations of metallurgical interest. The pile orc aerodynamically unsound. The pile orc is only capable of flight on Wednesdays except Ash Wednesday. Its characteristic cry is a wild and deafening you relation not unlike a horse resin. The cat's orb cats orbs were once numerous in Java and Batavia, but they have been almost wiped out possibly because they resemble stalks of wheat. The shovel a wreck, a shy bird, the shovel a wreck, feeds me on bags of Sue it eat from shipwrecks. It tears the bags open with its huge lacerating beak. The IP The earth is treasured by tiny and bewildered orphans. For harvest time it will roost atop unlikely clumps of foliage and sink also sweetly which provides a diversion in the poor unfortunate, otherwise dismal lives.

The immense floon the nomenclature of the immense floon is one of those endlessly fascinating ornithological puzzles tabulated by the Jesuit bird fancier father f x karpin. In his exhaustive book, eggs and talons, the immense floon is neither immense nor is it a floon nor a bird. But print, the print is fractious, terrified, rotating, cowardly, pompous, harsh, bilious, untenable, made of cloth and pig iron, and often found in railway sidings. The timestamp the pan stub is best known as the star of the long running television series, meet my pan stub, in which members of the public show their pan stubs to a studio audience. The gray fold Not to be confused with the vermillion fold. The gray Ford has been adopted as a mascot by the Association of icinga sugar enthusiasts. The tool bill is the tool bill, few confront can forget the Sherlock Holmes story in which the entire plot hinges upon the presence or absence of a cure bill. I am one of the few the Trump according to the testimony of that most winsome yet very into burnick. But the Riley bespectacled and quite possibly stone death happens through palmed crack, a man of whom it was said that Phantom or sprays perched on his skull. The tamp is possibly the most charming bird I have ever been attacked by the white spragg the poor, poor white spragg is considered a delicacy by Tasmanian bird eaters, and that spends much of its life hiding behind tractors,

wearables, and the ring Todd, also known as that bird with antenna, the ring Todd is capable of hearing sounds at such high pitch that laboratory experiments have sent many boffins completely insane 23rd bird, the frail Gruen the frail Gruen is a wholly dismal bird. The Oxford top fund of cast of sugar and welcome to the Oq fopp has a fiendishly complex chirp, which appears to be intelligible not only to other birds, but also to dromedaries, antelopes, and gnats. The Sneed, a toy Sneed, built from tungsten was stolen from the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas just two hours before the assassination of President john F. Kennedy. Not that the F stood not for Fitzgerald, as it's commonly supposed, but for full Mar, a type of duck. The blend, savage blends numberless of the fools who think the blend is a wistful Pacific bird. Not so I bear scars today from a childhood bled incident, fully recounted in my book 100 traumatic bird episodes out of print. But mo if two pens you go for the bittern, show stub, not your toe, nor cause yourself Whoa, no. Instead speak low, take up like pause and row where the stream does flow, but not the river pole. And in the sunset glow, the whole the shy and tiny Mo. The amhurst point pot. The feathers of the amhurst pint pot are truly remarkable. I have no idea why. I was once accosted upon a train by a raving ornithologist who swore that this was the case. And who was it argue? The word the word has one head, one tail, two wings and two legs. I have not had time to count its talons. The groaning fad, the groaning fad was popular, perhaps too popular in the iconography of 1960s easy Listening LP covers the gory Ajax with his name, florid, his complexion and mighty where his works. Among these works. Legend has it that he set free 10,000 degrees caged by the bird hating King and x aggro TAs the Kirpan? The Kirpan is a tremulous little bird which is known to flock in the vicinity of hot air balloons, aerostats and grade originals, especially those put out of commission because their fabric is frayed, rent Toon 33rd bird, the tiny shed, with its massive beak and laughably elongated legs. The tiny shed is often the butt of larger and more elegant birds, which give it to chase and ridicule it in a peculiar way a bird like manner, which has to be seen to be believed. The Tagalog worms form the staple diet of the pag glop, a singularly idle bird which can survive bewildering extremes of temperature. An ornithologist once accidentally trapped a padlock in her fridge freezer, from whence it emerged four months later, none the worse for wear. The next day the very same padlock suffered midflight concussion and plunged into a huge cauldron of boiling grease, regaining consciousness. Three days later, the padlock simply flew away. The Buta booters were the favorite birds of Bruce is my owner of the White Star Line. The company's most famous or infamous ship, was the Titanic, the sinking of which was survived by his my creature, his record cowardice later in life is my broken man tried to argue that the Titanic had not sunk but had in fact run aground on a grassy knoll. Yes, that grassy knoll. The snap, flightless blind in one eye and prone to fit. The snap admits a curious frog like croak when approached by Jesuit bus conductors and deposed monarchs.

The illusory red fig. birdwatchers have reported increased chances of success in spotting illusory red fig, if they first play each other with loganberry sandwiches and flasks of boiling hot custard. The giant clamper despite my vast and intimidating erudition, I confess that I'm wholly ignorant of the giant tramper the big snap, or possibly the beaker snap experts cannot agree on the correct term for this bird, and have not been helped by the astonishing popularity of Gus fangs book how to spell the names of birds according to win. The tragic clot massive and unruly. The tragic clot lives on the edges of cliffs in wind tunnels, and at the bottoms of abandoned wells. It is often mistaken for a loping Heron but only by those who don't know which side their bread is buttered on. The to be monstrous and implacable the to be is possibly the most dangerous bird on this or any other planet. Keep away from them for God's sake. The follow on pump quite wide the full on pump has been included in this list is beyond me. Granted it has a beaker has feathers, its wings, it's an goober doubly a bird, but it really is most unprepossessing 43rd bird, the Ecto blot Ah, we come up last to the Ecto blot, fondly known as the Rod Steiger of the aviary, cantankerous, doleful and sell them at rest. The Ecto blots of luminous Crimson plumage is surely evidence that God exists. The snagger snags are a type of gal. Like all girls, they're scavengers, however, being mentally unstable snagless tend to scavenge pointless things like blunted pencil sharpeners and broken cotton reels. The big drop what poetry lover has not felt a fresh or pure delight. Upon encountering gervaise beer pint slim volume of talk age lamp spotters in the gloom. I'm thinking of the first edition with the cover picture of a big drop in her nest, feeding her cuddly chicks with scrapings from a brand tub.

The old kargh pan. The following quotation is from an unknown source. That year, there was an Indian summer as a hard nosed press reporter I had spent months tracking down the so called umbrella man shown in photographs from Dealey Plaza. I was getting nowhere and I was down in the dumps to cheer myself up. I strode through Buttercup splattered fields, looking at the enormous blue sky blue, so blue, and they're blue to almost invisible. coming in from the south was a whole flock of old card pans. I nearly had a heart attack. The spattering Act, the stabbing deck is a parasitic bird. The chicks attach themselves to much larger ostriches once attached, if they fall off, they die. But hopeless caulk the hopeless caulks name is a misnomer. Indeed. It's one of the most optimistic of birds, possibly because it looks so appealing that even those with the hardest of hearts will readily toss breadcrumbs to it. The read flam was the read flam was it's the only bird in this list to be wholly mythical. Having said that, as I just did, it's not without charm. What it is without is a sense of direction, as it habitually confuses North with West, but not vice versa.

But batim beak exceedingly disagreeable, they harmless, the bass and beak is the most unmusical birds. You'll get no chairs or chips or chips out of this little fellow. God knows I've tried alternately feeding Gary Baldy biscuits and holding his head under a water pump, but all to no avail. Call me a fool, but I'm going to try again. Probably on Monday. The elicit Hoon jaw. Once upon a time, a little girl called Minnie said to her papa, papa.

it was blue. It rotated and it smelled of birds. The blue was certainly in the rotation was slow in January. It was a general sort of bird smell, one could not with any certainty, say ostrich or delamotte batches one might wish to. That slow juddery rotation was accompanied by a very faint clanking noise. So find that a pastor by huffing and puffing up the hill might think he imagined it. As he reached the top, put down his bag and lit his pipe. perplexity furrowing his forehead as he puffed on the savagely bitter cheap Serbian tobacco, the flesh around his piggy little eyes crinkly if molds or other burrowing creatures had created a temporary tasik on the hilltop, the passer by might sit on it for a while to rest his legs. Perhaps take off his big boots and socks, and picking a desultory way, the sock wall before examining his feet with greater diligence, fresh the color of curd little red soles on his toes. But his eyes will be drawn to that Sara Lee and blue and he would forget his feet. his socks were blue too. But that was just a coincidence. his boots were dappled and damn like a cows coloring like the end of land where there were cows to be seen. Unlike this land. If fog came down and swirl about our pastor by, he would be reluctant to move, with his piggy eyed vision occluded, that clanking noise would seem less faint, as his hearing grew sharper, perhaps two. Once he tapped out his pipe on a stone and the last wisps of the accurate Serbian smoke desert, dispersed, he would become aware of the smell of birds, where there were no birds nest. At the bottom of the hill, there is a sordid Tavern were miscreants, and ne'er do wells plot act of the utmost fiendish pneus and capitalize, they do so. The taverns wars are trimmed with GIMP passementerie this is Shrove Tuesday, so pancakes are being served. Unfortunately, the pancakes have been made with contaminated flour, and in days to come. This scene will be referred to as the mass poisoning horror of CAC pod, tak pod being the name of the village at the bottom of the hill, or one of its names, for it has others in other tongues. This being a country of 10 different languages, some of them spoken by only a smattering of citizens, and that smattering in its collective doted. Our Traveler with his foul pipe tobacco is not in his dotage, and he crashes excitedly through the tavern door, having scurried down the hillside at the first hint of the fog lifting. There is something in his manner that suggests is unused to the company of roughing. There is a throbbing in his pituitary gland and beads of sweat upon his brow. He has of course put back on his socks and boots, and taxis pipe into the breast pocket of his Austrian Postal Service jacket. Standing at the bar of this repulsive tavern, he asks the landlady for a refreshing minty pot hours with foam on top, he is thinking about surreally and blue juddery rotation and the smell of birds and in his frazzled mind, he is swept back to that day, years and years ago, when he danced a Fandango idhu char with a floozy, who wore Sara Lee and blue frog, on span around like a wild thing as she danced, and no she did not smell of birds. She had something of the look of a crow, bright black eyes, and a core vine nose. And yes, her hat was made of feathers was it not? The ne'er do wells ignore the new camera for they are too busy gobbling down the poisoned pancakes, which within hours will find them riding and groaning in the sawdust of the tavern floor. emboldened by the first few slips of his foamy portation however, the traveler asks the landlady, I say, What is that thing on top of your Hill, that blue rotating thing that smells of birds?

His voice is loud and resound in the stifling fog of the tavern, and there is a sudden silence. The landlady busies herself, pointedly polishing a tankard with a rag. Every single rapscallion stops chewing on his pancake, a dog that had been called asleep at the foot of the pianola gets to its feet and pads slowly out of sight into a dark back room. The clock above the bar stops ticking, all is still and silent and heavy with menoth. Eventually, it seems as if hours have passed, the ancient dog reappears and lies down in the doorway. The sounds of chewing and munching and clinking tankard starts up again. The landlady flings a rag onto the floor and dishes up more plates piled with pancakes. queasily aware that he has said something untoward, the traveler slurps down his cottage and takes his leave, edging past the sleeping hound. He does not know that within hours, all the pancake eaters will be dead and gone. But the dog is tormented by nightmares that the tavern will be condemned and formed a ruin. He steps outside the sky is black. He pairs with pink He is up to the top of the hill. But the blue rotating thing that smells of birds is engulfed in darkness and no longer visible. He turns to trudge towards qac pod railway station. The image of that floozy flickers before him. And now he remembers how she winched him onto a ship from the rock where he had been abandoned for 40 days, and how they danced and danced the tarantella. And how her frock was blue, and how she span and how, as midnight struck on the tavern clock, she turned into a Chrome

for a couple of quotations before the end of the show, and this is from myth and science, by Tito vignale. Once in passing through my chamber, my attention was so strongly fixed on an absent person, that I was not only vividly conscious of his form, but also of his voice and gestures. So I was amazed by the lively image brought before me, I could reduce other instances from my own experience and that of others, to show that in a waking an altogether normal state, we may believe in the reality of the image as we do in dreams. This vivid and momentary realization of images is very common in the lower classes. And and

yes, this is from the history of England and Great Britain by Professor Michael john. Charles second smart, smart birth. And we try again. Charles a second smilingly remarked, that it must surely have been his own fault that he did not come back sooner, for he saw no one who did not protest that he had always longed for his return. One Dobson, a member at Carleton in Kent, burnt his windmill as well as a bonfire for joy. So there you go. Next time you see a returning King, or are particularly happy about something, burn your own windmill. And that that I'm afraid is the end of the show for this week. I'll be back next week with more similar stuff. Although unlikely to include the list of 53 birds, but you never know. Might be 53 more. Yes, bye bye. The state
