Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. And this is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key. And one of the things about the interweb, the worldwide interweb, which of course is one of the where the where you will find the hooting on website is that things tend to tend to spread across it. So hooting yards global domination program is going ahead very well. I've gone there on a weekly column in a on a website called the dabbler, which I recommend. And this week, the dabbler actually did a review of impugned by a peasant and other stories, the latest hooting your paperback. So go to the dabbler and read the review, and then buy a dozen copies also, for all your friends for Christmas. And also part of part of the hooting yard global domination program. And this for this month. We're sort of somehow sponsoring the drabble cast, which is a America and American podcast of fiction, who Trey fiction. Nothing to do with Margaret drabble or her sister as Biet. Of course, I call is by Mum, because her own children call her as bad. Anyway, nothing to do with that is by Margaret drabble. But the drabblecast is very good. And it's run by a guy called norm Sherman, who are very fond of who has a very great reading voice, and has read some of my stories in the past. What else elsewhere, sometimes people on websites just pick things up, as happened yesterday. There's a website called, I think it's called Babbage country. Babbage town or something. And, and, yes, anyway, one of the contributors to that Kimiko Ying wrote this. With the coming of winter and the holiday season, one's thoughts naturally turned to food. So I would like to share this recipe for alphabet soup, which comes via one of the excellent chefs at Mr. Frank keys hooting yard. True, it isn't a traditional holiday food, but everyone loves a piping hot bowl of soup on a snowy day. And this dish has particular appeal to those of us who are bookish and how right she is. And after that Kimiko being pasted into into the website. This recipe. I can't remember when it first appeared or hooting yard. But it did devoted readers of hooting Yod Are there any other kind know that we do our utmost to bring you the very very best in modern cutting edge soup recipes. As part of the latest tranche. There is a marvelous example provided by Dr. Ruth pastries system mod ingredients. One pound each of apricot breadcrumbs, coleslaw, dandelions, Edelweiss stalks, flapjacks, and goldfish brains. six tablespoons of honey, two ounces of isinglass one pound each of jack door feathers, ketchup, love lies, bleeding, marmalade, new Gar and ox lips. One p, one tub of quicklime four ounces each of raisins spikenard, and toffee, 15 teaspoons of unspeakable goo, one family size catering pack of vinegar, three whelks, as much xanthine as you can stomach 12 packets of yeast, and 44 zinnias. method. Pound everything beginning with a vowel into a mulch, smear it onto the inside of a big bowl. Put the bowl somewhere safe and below freezing point for a week. Cut everything else up into chunks the size of a newborn baby's fist, then chargrill go and get the bowl and toss the chunks in haphazardly. Place the bowl under an outside spigot and fill to the brim with water.

Pour in some milk reboil indefatigably label off the scum from the top and serve with hibiscus clumps and cocoa

and when it appeared Babbage country or Babbage town or really should remember what it's called I'm sorry, I don't. There was a comment from bookworm Heinrichs, who said, quoted, pound everything beginning with a vowel into a mulch and asked, Does that include the yeast since Why isn't and sometimes a vow? Is is an and sometimes Val. And can Mika Yang replied well spotted Miss Heinrichs. I have not thought of that. Hmm. In that case, I suppose that pounding the yeast is optional. She drew this to my attention. And I have since informed her that of course, in the word yeast, why is continental continental so therefore, it shouldn't be pounded into mulch.

I mentioned the travel cost and one of the things about the travel cost that they like to do on that podcast is stories. Which are entirely 100 words long, exactly. 100 words long. So I have written for uncanny tales, each of which is 100 words long. So here they are. I was sitting on a bench in a tower on a bright summer's day. It was a Wednesday or possibly a Thursday in August in the year after the Kennedy assassination far far away in Dallas, and the air was heavy with verbena and hollyhock I was eating my snack. All of a sudden, gruesome separations of foul smelling extraterrestrial hideousness began oozing from my mama laden fish head sandwich, and I swooned when I came to. I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I remained unaware of it for the rest of my sordid and sorry life. too. They called him Blomqvist, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a room above the post office. No other living being ever set foot in the room until the day Blomqvist died. They found him lying on his bed as if he weren't asleep, but there was no doubt that he was dead. For hovering above his chest was a baleful Phantom, emitting gruesome sappy durations of foul smelling Extra Terrestrial hideousness which had poured into a funnel inserted into blown fists right ear like closed up the room and nailed the door shot. It remained on opened for the next hundred years. Three the bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis, the bird scientist. Look, there is a bird on the bell tower, he said to his pneumonia ract assistant Kubot who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips. Jarvis pointed at the bird expecting cabbage to look but the spindly youth was distracted by a passing pantechnicon all a clutter with pots and pans. It was the neighborhood when the man on his rounds and spookily sitting next to him in the passenger seat was a hideous Extra Terrestrial being separating greasy and malevolent.

For hand me that chaffinch Cabot said Jarvis to his lantern jawed assistant, Jarvis was a bird scientist devoted to the study of chaffinches wandering the hills he had spotted one. As Cabot picked up the chaffinch. He heard a scream. Spinning around he saw Jarvis being engulfed by a gruesome suck your writing monster. The poor lads scampered back to the lab and told what had happened to Mrs. purgative. Well, I never heard of such a theme she exclaimed. She hoisted her mop on her shoulder, took cabbage by his withered hand and led him far away all the way to gondwanaland

exciting technical hitch there, which means you didn't get any music. But luckily for you instead of silence I didn't sing like I did last week. And this is called q Terje. One 20th century Thursday under a lead and sky, the balletto my nan que was getting about the boulevards of pointy town when she encountered the Swiss dramaturge Rolf Terje, accompanied by his deputy dramaturge Bob DEP. Que much wha wha kissing of both air and cheeks immediately after which Nan que balletto main that she was began babbling excitedly about a new ballet she had seen only the other day of work of contemporary urgency in which the Hungarian toxicologic disaster was interpreted in the form of ungainly cavorting and the tooting of piccolos. I agree it is both urgent and contemporary. Rolf Terje managed to interrupt after 10 minutes or so, but it lacks the even greater, contemporary nyati and hectic urgency with which a dramaturge particularly a Swiss one would imbue it. Bob depth remained silent for unlike many a deputy, he was not facetious. Even were I to conclude that so unimed sorry, even were I to concede that so unimprovable? A ballet could be improved, said Nan que surely an indigenous Hungarian dramaturge would out Terje one from Switzerland. No. Might I suggest said Rolf Terje that so bad a bit isn't digital balletto main brain that the grand heroics of swish dramaturgy fall out with your pond of competence. Had they not been such fast pals Nan coo might have taken offense at this. As it was she made a mental note to ponder next time if you could concentrate on something other than the ballet for a few minutes. Rolf turgid, curious choice of the image of a pond to represent her area of knowledge and expertise. Bob Depp, who was skilled in the telepathic arts, chuckled and batted in, ponder upon as you like Nan Q, but the governor's usage merely reflect his and my current preoccupation, which is the pond plays of mod wasp, the waspish playwright, have any of them been adapted as ballets as the balletto main predictably, not as such said Bob Depp examined this could be seen as an enigmatic statement, but though he was telepathic, the deputy was as enigmatic as he was facetious, which is to say, not at all. Nan q was about to resume her seemingly endless blathering about the Hungarian toxic sludge disaster ballet, but before she could do so, Swiss dramaturge Rolf Terje blurted out a dramatic x postulation. Look, he cried. A hole has been dug in the road by some agency unknown to us, though we might surmise it to have been a fellow with a spade. He pointed as only a Swiss dramaturge could with an elegant the ring finger at the hole, and both Nan Q and Bob DEP peered where he pointed. The two gentlemen and the lady then contemplated the length of dug up pipeline exposed by the digging. At that very moment, the astonishingly tall renaissance man Peter Blake van was passing by, and he executed a drawing of the scene, helping to make it vivid for us. But not perhaps as vivid as we would like. The original drawing was fanatic with detail of Nan que Rolf toj and Bob depth, so much so that one might have mistaken it for hyper realist line. Oh cut by noted hyper realist line Oh cutter RX hyper But when Peter Blake that showed the finished drawing to the trio, they became strangely fractious and insisted that he obscure their features. Reluctantly, he did so unbeknownst to Peter blagoevgrad, but balletto nine and the dramaturge and the deputy dramaturge what each of them on the run from the pointy town police force, following a series of crimes against the performing arts. how one might commit such crimes is a mystery, as Mrs. Robert Fripp might put it,

mod wasp would put it more was specially for anyone to ask her opinion. But nobody did. For she lived in an ivory tower with her pet wasp, Martin in an atmosphere of Jacobean tragedy.

Now, this is the point where if everything was going according to plan, the music would come back in, and I would perhaps have a sip of tea if I had a cup of tea, which today I don't engage in jolly banter with john the sound engineer, but John's actually popped out. He's just coming back in and I'm babbling to make up for the fact that there's no music. But what I should be doing in all this time is telling you that of course, the Peter Blake bad drawing, referred to in that piece, I just read it from the cover of the album q Roan rather than q, Terje. And that you can see it on the hooting yard website, you can see the actual picture on the hooting Allen website. Anyway, that's the end of this entire story. hiatus. So imagine you've just heard a bit of the Caucasian lullaby and now I'm going to carry on with another piece. And this piece is called. Well, I won't tell you what it's called. all I'll say is it's from the Bible. Now that dwells in Gath, or moptop, whose name was ringgo, and one day the Lord appeared to Ringo and he was sort of frighted Ringo tugged at the fringe of his moptop so it might cover his eyes, that he could hide the Lord from his sight. Be not I feared mop top booms the Lord, for the Lord always speak in a boom when he appeared in gas. And ringgo, who carried a stick in each hand with which he thumped animal hides had dropped his sticks when tugging at his hair. Pick up device sticks, commanded the Lord and ringgo did so. What does that want with me Lord? wailed ringgo he was an Harry moptop with many rings on his fingers, and an innate sense of rhythm. Thou shalt hi the hens, turpis Gar, boom the Lord, and thou shalt climb to the top of the mountain, and thou shalt thump by sticks there upon the hides of bison and of salamander stretched upon a frame and thump them to upon disks of metal and make a den. And the Lord made mysterious maneuvers with his hands, and blessed ringgo the mop top, and then he vanished in a cloud of vapor isness and all was still and Ringo was alone in gas. And ringgo bit took himself with great haste to the main railway Terminus in Gath, where he might catch a train to take him all the way to Piz Gar. Now, at the railway Terminus, there was a satrap of exceeding girth, and Ringo spake unto him saying, I am centrepiece God by the Lord, but I know not how I might journeys ends from here, peace and love and the soundtrack belaboring go to a tank engine and commanded him in a voice of great pump to step aboard. And the tank engine was blue, the blue of heaven and with chugs and wheezes the tank engine with the moptop aboard set off along the branch line to piss Gar. But lo unbeknownst to Ringo, the mop top, the sack trap of exceeding girth had so arranged things that the engine was shunted into sidings halfway between gas and pyz Gar and they're it's sad and would not move and thus did ringgo them up top find himself marooned, and far from his car, and from the mountaintop, and his two sticks dangled from his bearings, fingers with not to thump. And he wept.

There is no music. So I'll just keep going, shall I? Yes, I will. I suppose I could hum the Caucasian lullaby, but that would not be a good idea. So, right, well, let's press on then. listener and occasional hooting yard on their guest babla Alistair Dixon forwarded to me an intriguing email he received and I'll read it in full. Herodotus storms smug, ignore ignominious breath. Flores Hapsburg, slippery slippery strong Boris broody strong Prato, storm Harada Curtis Jorah profane Loris flagging rubric meliora right Dixie Smaug homeopath smoke Josiah ignominious motif plebeian fluoresce, Josiah diesel hitch a fire flagging Josiah rubric sack onion hole hound hitch sack Walden tinned scotch tactile ardency Samoa ardency now Alistair thinks that this is a spam email, but I'm not so sure. I think the sender is trying to tell him something of great import of world shattering significance. Who actually what we could what I should be playing is the hooting yard chant which I have a recording of somewhere. How does that go? hooting yard hooting yard haha and gazebo we shall vanquish all our foes. We shall Where have all the flowers gone? We shall vanquish all our foes hooting hooting yard. There you go, that will have to do and now I'm going to read something else. There's an old countryside saying, as ye reap, so shall ye so especially in fingering home. Now, I've never been to fingering home, not even to explore it salt marshes, and I cannot attest to the truth or otherwise of that piece of rustic wisdom. All I will say for the time being pending an excursion to the salt marshes and perhaps to the village itself is that the saying seems on the face of it to turn standard agricultural practice on its head. Surely, before we reap, we must so and bearing in mind the startling efficiencies of crop rotation. It is not necessarily the case that we must so what we have just reaped, we can so something else as another countryside saying has it where once I had cauliflowers, now I have peas in that field beyond the trees. Although that may not actually be a bit of rustic law, I may have just made it up whimsically to no apparent purpose. That's one of the quandary one faces when striding around the salt marshes and encountering a peasant given to intoning countryside sayings. You can never be sure whether he's repeating something that his has stood him and his ancestors in good stead for generation and a generation from before fingering. How even appeared on the map. Gosh, even before there were any maps to speak of whether he's just babbling in consequential realities due to a god poisoning or simple mystery. There was some kind of test one could carry out to ascertain whether what one was listening to was genuine rustic wisdom or no. Perhaps if I made that excursion to fingering how and to its salt marshes, and put up in a boarding house and stayed there for years and years and kept my eyes and ears keenly alert from dawn to dusk. I might be in a position to sort hard one truth from harebrained twaddle.

Frank Key  24:55
And, yes, so there was a bit of silence there. Now. I'm trying to work out To read something fairly short because it's nearly the end of the show. So, here's more rustic wisdom I think. Some Dunstan's cap. Some Dunstan's cap is the name given to a Wassall and cruising practice, once popular in the fence and the deputies. In the midst of a waterland cruise, a participant would throw their drained goblet up in the air, and whoever caught it with one hand upon its descent would become sent Dunston. Other water coolers and cruisers would then pick some Dunston up, carry him to the yard out with the waterline and cruising parlor and fling him into a cess pit. After wallowing up for a few minutes, some Dunston would then heave himself out of the pit, crawl back into the parlor, and shout, which among you is my uncle al fee, Bishop of Winchester. The person roaring their head off at the most ear shattering volume would be dubbed the bishop. And st Dunstan would hand them the goblet, which would again be tossed into the air, and that's the whole senseless business would begin again. But most waffles and cruises in the fens and decrees some Dunstan's cup would continue until everybody present had been flung into the cesspit at least once. The practice is sort of died out with the development of modern sanitary methods of coping with human filth and mark in these in those while selling and cruising parlors, which still survive, it's been replaced by a game called St. Dunstan's tongs. This is a far more complicated pastime with abstruse rules and has been described as contract bridge for the hopelessly in libri. At some Sunday, newspapers published in the fens, and ditches Kerry columns devoted to the strategy and tactics of some dunstans tongs written in impenetrable prose. Next week, since dymphna, is pinking shears that's the end of this week's hooting yard. I hope you've enjoyed it. This in spite of the lack of exciting Caucasian lullaby music in between stories. And don't forget to visit the hootin yard website. And also the other websites I sent you to today, the dabbler and the drabblecast. And my apologies to Kimiko saying that I can't remember the precise name I think is I think is Babbage country, but try and go there as well. And, and then go back to anything odd. Yes. Anyway, that's the end of this week show. I shall be back with more of the same sort of thing next week. And hopefully, we'll have music to play there. Do we have music to play now? JOHN? We do. JOHN is nodding. So now we can
