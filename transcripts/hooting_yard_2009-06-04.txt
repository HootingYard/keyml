Good evening punters, this is resonance 104 point four FM it's 630 on Thursday evening if you're listening live, which means reaching out. To me, Frank. Just as a bus is the best place for abuse, you should ideally perform a basement in a basement. There's something about the subterranean nature of the location, which lends itself to the embrace of personal wretchedness. Obviously, the basement must first be prepared with the installation of a shrine or altar to an enraged and merciless deity. For example, to hideous back God, fatso, or Allah. adherents of the latter usually claim he is All Merciful. But come on. We all know that twaddle. Allah does as much smiting as Jehovah and has an extremely lengthy list of harmless Indeed, he construes as wrong doing. His sin catalogue is almost as bulky as fat sews. Whether you choose Jehovah or Allah or the hideous bat God fatso is entirely up to you. The important thing is to have a focus for your groveling in your basement. Once you've installed your shrine or altar, or what's it, never again bother to sweep the floor of your basement with a broom. By allowing dust and debris to settle and molder. You create an apt surface upon which to prostrate yourself flat on your belly while bewailing your utter worthlessness. If you have picked for your diet, ie one of the ones that allows itself to be depicted by human hand, make sure the picture or icon is terrifying in its intensity, and shows the God in a particularly bad temper. Actually, you can do this for one of the image forbidding gods to because by having wrought a picture of them, you'll just make them more enraged and the angrier they are, the better as far as your basement is concerned. I hope it's clear why you should avoid a woolly liberal de essay like gentle Jesus, in a chunky Church of England cardigan, whose reaction to your big government what is likely is not their compassionate smile and a helping hand to lift you from the grubby floor. If you're going to get the hang of this a basement business, you want to provoke Roth and scourges and plagues of locusts and Thunderbolts. There is no minimum time to spend face down in the market in the dark of your basement. A properly vengeful and psychotic diety will not be assuaged with a mere 10 or 15 minutes here or there. Best to plan for the day and night and the following day. And the night again, at least, and no sneaking up to the kitchen for a snack. Unless of course it is a Diet of Worms.

small parts of it. One thing I find peculiarly distressing is the number of persons of frantic mean, who rushed up to me and cluttered my lapels besieging me, Mr. Key Mr. Key they plead in cracked tones. Please tell me how to see gnomes. I want to be able to see gnomes. What always poor souls have in common is a tragic awareness that gnomes exist, coupled with an inability to perceive them. I speak of course of real gnomes, which though they bear a striking resemblance to the jolly garden known beloved of suburbia with his pointy hat and pot belly and occasionally his angling equipment, by no means made of stoneware or plastic and cannot be bought in a garden, the center real gnomes caper in the woods going out there no me business, but a very difficult to see. Yeah, judging by the number of people who buttonhole me in the street, there's clearly a great desire among our citizens to get Down with the gnomes, marches, politicians like to get down with the kids. It's never been entirely clear to me why I should be thought to have some kind of inner track to the world of gnomes. I can only surmise that hooting yards reputation as a repository of the sum of human and inhuman knowledge must be spreading far and wide. And this must be a good thing. Lord knows I try my best, both here on the radio and on the website to expand the wisdom of the ages. Despite the often disheveled and wild eyed state of my street import tuners, it is good to know that my efforts are not entirely in vain. So what I usually do when assailed by one of these social inadequates is to take them aside and after checking that they have sufficient cash to pay for a couple of cups of tea, lead them to a cafe where we sit together at a Formica top table. They usually come down a bit after a couple of slurps of tea, though I often have to explain that I have not brought them to Nome land as such, and they're unlikely to be able to see any gnomes just yet. This can crush the spirits of the more emotionally frail besiegers who seem to think I can just snap my fingers and make gnomes appear before their eyes. It takes patience and empathy. And there's many additional cups of tea for me as they can afford to explain things to them. Eventually, still in the cafe and possibly stuffed with pastry treats, too, depending on the financial resources of the shabby, indigent opposite me, I removed from my pocket a scrunched up scrap of paper, on which I've copied out some very wise words, I unscratched, the scrap and read as follows. This charm is an extract from Theosophy, an introduction to the supersensible knowledge of the world and the destination of man by Rudolf Steiner, published in 1910. He says the spiritual outlook, in fact is through the spirit of the age, the Zeitgeist extended over a variety of other beings, both lower and higher, who live in the environment of man without his being able to perceive them with his bodily senses. But those who have powers of spiritual sight, perceive such beings and can describe them. To the lower kinds belong those designated by the spiritual investigator as salamanders, selves, undines, and gnomes. It is quite to be understood that anyone who is inclined to admit the validity of physical vision only regard such beings as the offspring of a wild hallucination and superstition. They can of course, never become visible to the physical eye, for they have no physical bodies. The superstition does not consist in regarding such beings as real, but in believing that they appear in a way perceptible to the physical senses. beings with such forms cooperate in the building of the world, and one comes into connection with them. As soon as one enters the higher regions closed to the bodily senses. And after reading that, I scrunch up the scrap of paper, shove it back into my pocket, and after getting the pitiful wretch to hand over any remaining cash they have about their person, dismiss them from my presence, my presence being Of course, a shining aura, illuminating the gutter. He was a very clever man that Rudolf Steiner

long key Granja walls and possibly still is the French counterpart of the grumpy man. History tells us that he was active in the countryside around Avenue during the period when it was the seat of the papacy, that is from 1309 to 1377. Between the reigns of Pope Clement the fifth and Pope Gregory the 11th. There are some mischievous Wags, who claim this as evidence that the grumpy man is a practicing Roman Catholic, but I think we may safely turn our noses up at them sniffily. It is of course the case that for as long as anybody can remember the van A city at Rome has been periodically menaced by the so called Lumo Greg Nieto, and I will have much to say on that at a future date if you're good. Long key Granja is said to be hairier, huger and grumpier than the grumpy man and thus more terrifying. He made regular incursions by nightfall into Ave itself, but never managed to scale the immense 18 feet thick walls of the Gothic Pele dead pack, and so was never able to carry off one of the Pope's or his non CEOs back to his nest in the woods. You raise your eyebrows at my use of the word nest, but it's carefully chosen for one of the chief differences between the grumpy man and long key Granja is that the latter lurked not in a layer, but in a series of nests, bills of twigs and branches and forest debary high in the trees. When exhausted from his countryside predations, or just in need of a bit of peace and quiet, long key Granja wood clamber in his ungainly and grunty way up the trunk of a mighty horn beam or cedar, and flop into the nest he had made there. It must have angered him that with all his climbing practice, the palay itself remained impregnable. No doubt that is why the peasantry told tales of loud and frustrated grunting noises being bellowed from tree tops around Avenue. Sophisticated city folk sneered at their rustic neighbors for such stories, but we hear an echo of them in for example, the ballad a bagatelles of the 14th century Uber minstrel low thar Pang, Dennis beer pints grandmother, my prose translations of some of pangs pieces, and in one of them we find this a woodsman ran screaming from the woods. He had lost his cabin, His hair was disheveled. He threw himself into the river and swam downstream until he reached the village of distressed mumbling. There he was hauled out of the water by a tavern keeper who put smelling salts under his nose. Pray to God in heaven shouted the capitalist woodsmen for I have heard loud and frustrated grunting noises from atop a gigantic horn beam, and I am too frightened to ever take go back into the woods. How am I to feed my children. The kindly Tavern keeper handed the woodsman a mop and told him he would give him a suit if he swapped the filthy floor of the tavern. And every day he swapped the floor, he would get another suit, and a year passed and the woodsmen had enough Sue's to feed his scrawny children with slops and gruul. He thanked the tavern keeper and jumped into the river to swim upstream back through his horrible cottage bordering the woods. But the weight of the Sue's in his Pipi bag, dragged him under and he drowned and his children's starved. It's a typically Pang esque fable, ending in horror and ruin and death. And it seems clear to us that the source of the woodsman's fright is long key Granja there is a sense in which we wish Lothar Pang was explicit about this, perhaps having the French grunty man lumbering out of the woods at the end of the tail, and gobbling up the defenseless children in the cottage. But perhaps Pang was mindful of arrival set of legends about long murky Golan, in which far from being a grunting ogre of terror. He is a tragic figure, a huge and hairy lumbering monster who thinks he is a little Sparrow. In this tradition, his nesting habits are explained, but the constant attempts to clamber over the walls of the Palais de Papp are ignored. As a sparrow Of course, or rather, in the delusion of Sparrow them, long key Granja does not feed on human flesh, and that would have no motive for attacking the woodsman's orphaned tinies in the cottage.

Several researchers have tried to tie the two sets of Legends together. The stumbling block is always the dilemma of why a grantee man which believes itself to be a bird would be so desperate to see the pope Hattie Meldrum this paper entitled The giant savage Catholic flightless grunting Sparrow theory is bogged down by far too many footnotes to forward a convincing argument. And in any case, her whisperings were demolished by taobh during a television cat show appearance. Sadly, Tom is back crushing others reputations than advancing his own peculiar lines of thought, and to date, he has published nothing. After the papacy returned to Rome in the Great Schism stories about long the key grown in either of his incarnations became fewer until gradually, he was utterly forgotten. Then suddenly, early in the 20th century, he reappeared, blamed for a series of railway accidents in and around Avenue. This latter day long key groan is yet another variation on the legend, still hairy and huge and grunty. Still terrifying. But now waylaying steam trains as they patrol on French rural branch lines. There is no suggestion that he thinks himself a sparrow, nor any kind of bird at all. But neither according to the tails, does he threaten children, except inadvertently should they be railway passengers. Now, long Qigong is impelled by a ravening hunger, a hunger that can only be cited by shoveling great poor falls of burning coal down his gullet. And that is what he does, or did in the last century, every day, in and around avinu grunting

wring out your mouse, let your buckets clang. Peel off your protective gloves and shove them down a hygienic waste shoot. Lets us spray Polish against the burning sky. These were the stirring words bought from a podium by Sega Merv the janitor revolutionary who led the so called janitorial uprising from a broom cupboard in a corridor in a large public building. He marched at the head of no fewer than five or six other janitors mops held high to the very gates of the princelings palace. There, they were not cut down as they have expected to do to be by the swords and catapults of the princelings palace guard. Instead, they were met just outside the gate by a CD and wheedling msre, who took them into the broom cupboard of a palace annex and plied them with mugs of steaming tea. We do not know what the rebellious janitors were promised in that stifling cupboard. But forever after sag, Merv was a bitter and beaten man shunned by his colleagues. It was said that the incandescent fire of his revolutionary practice had been doused by something as simple as a hot drink without sugar. Certainly it's true that before the day of the historic march was done, all the janitors were mopping floors again, segue Merv himself, mopping not just floors, but the impossibly grandiose floors of the princelings palace itself. The story or a version of it is retold in a new film by trendy goatee bearded director chippy van bang, Merv princeling imagines that the CD and wheedling emissary was in fact the princeling himself in heavy disguise, and that his CD and wheedling ways were more than a match for the severely flawed practice of sag Merv. It was a practice of course, which had been hammered out in 1000 janitorial broom cupboard meetings held in secret by candlelight, with much cigarette smoke and gruff shouting by Slavic janitors with tremendous mustaches. Although his sympathies with sag Merv trippy van bang shows that the tides of history were in the princelings favor, the director, who also wrote the screenplay, worrying away at it for over 20 years, suggests that integral to the princelings triumph was the Blasi Blanca, Tina's Enos of his vision which simply swept sag moves mopey rhetoric aside, there may be a slight problem there with a vision being able to sweep aside record But in the spirit of this extraordinarily powerful film, I'm not going to let niceties get in my way. chippie van bang certainly doesn't fit as usual with his work. Any niceties are obliterated, much as if they had been thoroughly mopped from the floor of a corridor and wrung out into a bucket

whose head is always inclined and unmoving angle. His neck I think, must be a subtle one. He tells me often shouting at me from a distance of only a few inches, that he has startling capacity in one of his lungs, and almost none in the other. And that from day to day, sometimes even from hour to hour, there is a sudden switch that lung that was capacious, becoming clogged and vice versa, to his own satisfaction, he has described this to a pneumatic curiosity within his being, he says, or rather shouts that it causes him no discomfort, and he has on no occasion discussed it with a Doctor of Medicine. I've asked him if In addition, he has a hydraulic peculiarity, but answer comes there none, for he's not the most skillful of conversationalist. Even when leaning against a mantle piece at a cocktail party, a situation where one might expect him to make some effort, he remains silent, his head at that odd angle, until someone comes close up to him a few inches away. That is when he begins shouting. He has the piercing eyesight of a seagull. So myopia is not the explanation for his conduct. He shouts about matters other than his lungs, and can even be amusing. For instance, when mimicking the sound of blotting paper being dragged across a pinboard. If one accepts that he will never answer a question directly put to him, nor hold his head at a reassuring angle, he can prove a splendid companion. And of course, there is his Tonka, which he keeps smooth by shaving it morning and evening and rubbing into it and ointment of his own recipe. He's also been known to diet, gold, or sometimes blue, as the fancy takes him. He claims neither the tonchi itself nor his dying of it has any ritual significance that it is mere whim. Funny kind of when I say others say the same and less politely, there is much muttering that the tundra is symbolic of something that the changes in the color of the die at those times it is applied, relate to the moon and the tides, or to the gestation period of squirrels, otter cycles, yet are known to cosmologists. Whether the buffoon is aware of such talk or not is a moot point. It's not something he's ever shouted about while leaning against a mantle piece or otherwise. We were all surprised when he was placed under arrest. crime of any kidney was the last thing one would associate with him. He was held in one of the fortresses which borders the main square, but which one? Ah, now that was a mystery. There are different purposes are announced only by the flags hung outside them, each of which is in its own way, a masterpiece of decorative obfuscation. The centuries a mute, there are no windows on the lower floors, and those higher up are a frosted glass. It goes without saying that they're bulletproof and proof against any other projectile, including the fist of a man clad in chainmail hanging from a winch attached to an illegal helicopter. That man was me actually in a mad escapade from which I somehow emerged with body and soul intact. With the protracted absence of my friend, I sank into melancholy. I missed his close range shouting, and that's a fact. Then one day, years later, his head still at that unnerving angle on his neck appeared on our postage stamps, but the torture was gone. I could not fathom nor could any of us what these two startling developments meant. The mutterings long unmatted started up again with some desperation when the morning cart clattered through the port calluses of the fortresses on Thursdays. We gathered in the square, wondering if we would see our old friend being carried upon one dressed in finery perhaps a scepter held aloft or bound and gagged and on his way to the gallows. But week followed week, and we saw only the usual mix of nobles and criminals, sometimes even sharing a cart. By the turn of the year, we stopped going to the square all together and remained huddled in our chalets playing games of lanten jaw or spite, smoking our pipes, and swatting flies.

I never forgot the buffoon, though I fear for some of my old but sorry, I'll start that paragraph again. I never forgot the buffoon. Though I fear some of my colleagues did. I kept a collection of the postage stamps upon which his head had appeared long after it was supplanted by new issues, showing the moon and the stars and pregnant squirrels and up and coming cosmologists, those I did not collect. Nor did I ever find out what had become of my shouty difficult power. Until on my deathbed, yesterday, or possibly the day before he appeared hovering in a haze above my head, his his mouth moved, as if he were shouting, but there was no sound. I never learned to read lips. So I do not know what this shade or Phantom or whatever it was, was trying to tell me just before it vanished in a sort of vaporous bursting, I saw that the angle of the head was no longer weirdly askew. Indeed, it was perfectly straight or upright, but I saw that the Tonka had reappeared, and it was golden again. Oh, so golden, and I was blinded by it.

Frank Key  27:09
That's the end of this week shooting yard, I'm now going to vanish in a sort of vaporous bursting, but with a bit of luck, I'll be back next week to read to you for another half hour or so. Bye bye.
