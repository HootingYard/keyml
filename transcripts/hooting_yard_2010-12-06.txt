Good evening. This is hooting yard on the air with me Frank key on resonance 104 point four FM or on resonance fm.com. And this is the final hooting yard of the year. So in the absence of a Christmas special have attempted to make this as sort of special because much of the program will be devoted to the Victorian writer say bine baring Gould of whom more in a moment, but I thought I should begin this week's show with a small PostScript about the greatest headline of the century, which you may recall from a couple of weeks ago, which was porpoises rescue Dick Van Dyke, genuine newspaper headline for a genuine story. Anyway, this was read this headline by the television presenter Adrian chiles, and he was consumed by jealousy. Ever since he was tiny. Apparently, Adrian child had hankered to feature in an exciting new story alongside sea creatures. And now his thunder had been stolen by the octogenarian pretend chimney sweep. It was too much to bear. Yet rather than turning his twisted mental havoc upon Dick Van Dyke, the West Bromwich Albion supporting television anchorman began to plot vengeance against the very secret jurors, which until now had fascinated him. In his mania, he decided to obliterate the largest secret care he could obtain, and to obliterate it in the most disgusting way, by eating it. And he decided to make his revenge a festive occasion by arranging his found dinner to take place on the very day when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. What demons swept through his maddened mind to so finesse is our natural act. Alas, no hint was given of his motives. In the newspaper report, which followed in the Tripoli photocopied weekly cut aciem News RoundUp under the headline, a Wales Christmas in trials.

And so onward with say bind bearing gold 1834 to 1924. So he had a long life, and he wrote an incredible number of books. He was one of those country Parsons, who seldom ever left Devin and apparently spent all day standing up at his lectern in his study, writing every day. He was also a he's quite well known these days as a collector, one of the first collectors of folk song and folklore. He also wrote hymns including onward Christian soldiers, a 16th volume lives of the saints, many almost unreadable novels, a study of werewolves, grave desecration and cannibalism. And a biography of Robert Steven Hawker. The eccentric country Vicar, who spent much of his time smoking opium in a cliff top hot, made from driftwood, talk to birds, dressed up as a mermaid, excommunicated his cat and had a pet pig. So Robert, Stephen Hawker was a slightly more eccentric country Vicar, sensei bond bearing gold but bearing gold had his own eccentricities, given that he wrote so much over so many years. And so we'll begin with a little snippet from a biography of him by William Purcell. Back to his days as a student. I say bye and had a warm liking for his tutor, and that he in return was looked upon with affection. Surely to some extent shown by the fact that he was asked by Mr. Goodwin to choose his wife's hats. Mrs. Goodwin, it seems had appalling taste. The result of leaving her to dress herself could be shocking in the extreme. Her husband's pupil was therefore asked and apparently agreed not only to accompany the lady in an advisory capacity when she went shopping, but also to inspect her before she left the house. Mr. Goodwin was later made Bishop of Carlisle, a characteristic choice for one of those bishops who, as the century progressed, found themselves faced by forces greater than they were equipped to understand who supervised his wife's choice of hat in Carlisle is not recorded. And we'll continue with another snippet from that biography. It's now 1867. And our hero is 33 years old, and has been appointed to the position quote, with the depressing title of perpetual curate, quote to Dalton. Dalton, a Hamlet in Swaledale was called not without reason. Dalton it Mook, by reason of the remarkable amount of mud through which few inhabitants have in winter to make their way. A profusion of wild flowers in summer was an agreeable feature of the place, though somewhat outweighed by at least three disadvantages, the smallness of the stipend, the stupidity of the people, and the enthusiasm of the Vikings contest down. The natives were perhaps affected by the mud that reminded me of Ruskin's peasants of the voad wild valleys where the marshes blast their helpless inhabitants into fevered idiocy ism.

We now turn to the words of the man himself. In this extract from his reminiscences say buying bearing gold gets stuck in a bog. He's out on Dartmoor, or perhaps Bodmin more with a Mangle Thomas from the Ordnance Survey. As night falls, the pair realize they are hopelessly lost. And what follows is a quotation from the reminiscences the Bargate tonight exile, the deathlike sickly odor, lots of sound could be heard. No bird was roused, not an insect hummed. It was night now, not even a spark, not a jack o' lantern. We could no longer see each other, and we could cease to call to each other. Then all at once a fear came over me that we had got into CRO de Marche. I had seen quite enough of that. It is not composed of Pete. It is simply water, which is slimy with decomposing vegetable matter. It is dangerous to men, and fatal two beasts. All at once I added a cry of help me and sank to my armpit. It was instantaneous. I was in water, not on moss, and in sinking, all I could do was to capture some particles of floating muscle fiber, half rotten read and water weed, and rake myself forward with strokes like those of a swimmer till I could lay hold of the sponge like surface of moss that formed the skin over the quaking bog. The moss was a foot thick, very porous, but light, so that it floated till saturated with water. In my struggles, I drew much of this moss towards me, but as I pressed on it, it sank under my weight, became waterlogged and surrounded me helping to suck me down. against the one sky, I could see the masa mount brackets, Inc, which wavered and rolled as I clung to and dragged at it. Finding that my effort to unavailing and by this means I could never extricate myself. I extended the bamboo I held horizontally, a hand at each extremity and press this down on the surface of the moss. By this means, I managed to heave myself up I had just enough power to throw my head and my neck forward on the moss with arms extended like a spider. I felt as if I was striving against a gigantic octopus that was endeavoring with boneless fleshy arms to drag me underwater. So great indeed was the suction that the leather gators that extended to the knee was torn off my legs. Having thus reached the surface and spread myself upon it, I worked myself along till I arrived at a hassock of course, grass or read on that I planted myself to breathe. I was quivering in every muscle after the supreme strain of wrenching myself out of the mire. There was still a long tract of moss, very similar in nature to that through which part I had struggled, and I was fine to go through it in the same manner, as before rising along like a lizard. At length I came to firm land, exhausted, panting, my brow beaded with twit, yet at the same time, conscious of extreme cold from immersion. I called again and again, and soon came up with Thomas. The stench of the decomposing matter in my nostrils, sickened me, however, a sense of relief and exhilaration came over me, and we made our way on till we struck a road and finally reached out in I found my purse in my pocket sodden by watching my waistcoat pocket stopped, I found moss on my left shoulder, so that I had sunk that far. And as I had said, the suction tore my gators off my legs.

One of the sideline bearing gold books I read was curiosities of olden times 1869, written when our hero was living in the abundant mud of Dalton milk. And, in this book, one of the essays he examines legal proceedings, taken against snails, flies, mice, mold ants, and caterpillars, etc. And he gives us the precise wording recommended when one wishes to excommunicate such vile creatures. This was drawn up by Bartholomew the fastener, a noted lawyer of the 16th century. If you intend to do this, note that you should always bring your case against creepy crawlies and vermin before the ecclesiastical rather than the civil courts. And you might want to make a note of this wording the correct form of excommunication is as follows. Oh, snails, caterpillars, and other obscene creatures which destroy the food of our neighbors depart hence leave these cantons which you are devastating and take refuge in those localities where you can engine no one I n p etc it's unclear to me whether that etc indicate simply the reading of the Lord's Prayer i n p standing for in nominate Patras or whether there are further animate versions anathemas to follow. In the absence of any clear guidelines, I suppose you'll have to get the presiding ex communicator to improvise.

And two more bits from say bone bearing gold. This is from the same book, and it contains a very useful description of Adam, are for forbear our forefather. antoaneta, boring young, that extraordinary mystic of the 17th century had some strange visions of the primeval man and the birth of Eve. The body of Adam, she says, was more pure, translucent and transparent than Crystal Light and buoyant. As air in it were vessels and streams of light, which entered and exuded through the pores. The vessels were charged with liquors of various colors of intense brilliancy and transparency. Some of these fluids were water, milk, wine, fire, etc. Every motion of Adam's body produced ineffable harmonies, every creature obeyed Him, nothing could resist or injure him. He was taller than men of this time, His hair was short, cold and approaching to black. He had a little down on his lower lip. In his stomach was a clear fluid, like water in a crystal bowl, in which tiny eggs developed themselves, like bubbles in wine, I see glowed with the ardor of divine charity. And when he strongly desired that others should unite with him in the work of praise, he deposited some of these eggs which hatched and from one of them emerged, his consoled Eve. If you've seen anyone answering to that description, please contact your local police or a priest in strictest confidence and and finally with them, say bond bearing gold. Oh, yes, no. Two more things. One thing is that is a bit from the the biography of Robert Steven Hawker. I was frankly a little disappointed in the book because the most arresting of hawkers eccentricities I summed up at the beginning of the show. And really, there isn't much more in baring gold book to add, apart from a detailed account of when he dressed up as a mermaid, and my part of my disappointment was disappointment was to discover that this was a single occurrence, not something he did as a general pastime. But here here is, here is another note about something else about Robert Stephen Hawker. After the death of Mrs. Hawker, he fell into a condition of piteous depression, and began to eat opium. He moaned about the cliffs or in his study, and lost interest in everything. He took it into his head, that he could eat nothing but clotted cream. He therefore made his meals, breakfast dinner and tea of this, it became consequently exceedingly bilious, and his depression grew that greater. And that finally there is one particularly splendid passage in the biography which is really absolutely nothing to do with Hawking himself. It's about the wording of a sign outside a little shop in Cornwall and save on bearing gold rights as follows before quoting from it, the people of welcome are very ignorant. Indeed, a good deal of ignorance lingers still in the West of England, the schoolmaster has not yet thrown a great blaze of light on the Devonian mind, and the Cornish mind is not much better illuminated. I give a specimen of English composition by a schoolmaster of the old style in Devon shear, and it might be guessed that the Cornish fared not better for teachers than their Wessex neighbors. This is an advertisement written over a little shop and I should point out that what is not obvious when I read it to you on the radio is that virtually every single word in this is misspelled. Roger Giles surgeon, parish Clark and schoolmaster grocer and hundred acre, respectively informed ladies and gentlemen that he draws teeth without waiting a minute applies will eat cheese every hour, blisters on the lowest terms and Physics for a penny apiece.

Fantastic shop. I'd go to Roger dial shop any time the other day. What is it today the 16th to two days ago, the hooting yard website, which of course you visit often hooting yard.org You should go there now and send me a Christmas gift by buying one of my books or making a donation or taking out a subscription. That's always appreciated that anyway. What was I saying? Yes, the hooting odd website two days ago was seven years old, but I was disconcerted on trawling back through the archives to note that in seven years, every Yuletide season has passed without the appearance of what one would have thought was essential. A hooting yard Christmas gift guide. God alone knows how you'd have coped anyway. Following an exclusive commercial tie in with the most gorgeous department store in the known universe, humans, I can now rectify this terrible emission. Here are five superlative gifts available at bargain bin prices from a bin outside the bargain bin basement of Huberman beacons door. Jumbo Sacco agricultural waste matter. The perfect gift for the peasant in your life. A mind numbingly gigantic burlap sack absolutely crammed packed with noise some slurry and farm filth or a wandering mendicants collapsed lung preserved in jelly surgically removed by top doctors from the corpse of a wandering mendicant this collapsed lung has been expertly preserved in special jelly is what it says on the jar. Or you might want to get a two in one Marionette made from old coat hangers rags and solidified puff pastry.

When voila, you have a lifelike Bernard Cribbins doll hours of fun with two of your favorite non fiction characters. Provide your own string and the fourth gift Grow Your Own marsh. Transform your living room into an eerie Marsh, complete with mythic vapors. inexplicable darting light and pipe smoking marched brights. Simply sprinkle the contents of the sachet onto your carpet and watch it dissolve before sinking up your armpits and flailing hopelessly. Just like say bine baring Gould And finally, the radiating lands of St. papo. If you have any Belgian Catholics in your family, they will treasure this miniature plastic toy lands radiating fire from heaven, just like the lance of St. poppo, one of the first Flemish pilgrims to the Holy Land. I should add a little PostScript to that actually, because I posted the the gift guide on the hooting org website. And it came to my attention shortly afterwards that several readers and as it may be several listeners to this show, think that St. papo. He of the radiating Lance, is a figment of my imagination. On apparently given to dubbing fictional characters with names not dissimilar to papo. One is reminded perhaps have seen your plot bow, who had a dramatic conversation with a bird called Ambrose. Well, while I admit and an equally dramatic sigh. May I point out yet again, with some exaggeration that the contents of the hooting yard website and of this radio program is almost entirely factual, based as it is on exhaustive research. St. poppo, whose dates are 977 to 1048 is a real St. It's true that occasionally I might make something up from a sense of mystery, or embroider certain facts to add a tad of P Quincy or grit. But generally speaking, what you have here is straightforward reportage this planet of ours is very, very old, you know?

Anyway, if you don't believe me about papo if you go to the website, hooting yard.org you can see a tremendous photograph of a fully posable toy action figure of him. That will probably be my Christmas card for the year, I think if I send one. So that's it for hooting yard for 2010. I hope you've enjoyed it. Yes, I haven't really got anything else to say Happy Christmas, Happy New Year, all that kind of thing. do go to the website, where you can one of the other things you can see is essays by schoolchildren about shooting yard stories genuine, that was very entertaining. Go and have a look anyway, leave your comments, send me a gift, and all that kind of thing. And I'll be back in the new year. Bye bye
