Good evening, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Before we get on with the main main business of today's show, I just like to read a letter I received from someone called p funnel, who wrote, Dear Mr. Qi, I've been listening or actually re listening my way through the hooting yard podcast archives, and I'm struck by some of your preoccupations. There are things and people you regularly refer to which seemed to have little or nothing in common, no overarching theme, as it were, yet you seem obsessed with them. A brief but by no means complete list would include pigs cows, the Munich air disaster, the Kennedy assassination on the 22nd of November 1963. Peter Maxwell Davis eating an accidentally electrocuted whooper Swan, the Hindenburg disaster, Yoko Ono, googie, withers and David Blunkett. I realized that my selection includes to aerial disasters. So that's a common thread, but otherwise none of them seem to link up in any coherent way. Are there some profound psychological reasons that cause you to harp on about these subjects? Or are you just repeating yourself? And whichever is the case? Can you give any clues as to how one might predict whether or not an event or a person might become embedded in your brain? And that crop up time and time again in hooting yard? You will sincerely p funnel? Well, I suppose it would be polite of me to Sorry, I suppose it was polite of me to reply to these questions. So I will try at some point to frame a response once I've finished making my set of Hazel Blears finger puppets. So anyway, that was the letter I received and this is a story called lagu breus. fooled. Prince food Geneseo had a heart of stone and his palace was a palace exceeding glum. No, no, it was not a palace. It was a castle targeted and towered with many flags and banners flying every one of them showing blasphemous heraldic devices. All sorts of abominations featured on these flags from unicorns with five legs to many headed Hydra from fiery basil iscs to crows whose heads were back to front. The prince his henchmen patrolled the castle battlements through every hour of day and night, armed with swords and daggers and blunder buses and glue guns and pipes from which to blow poisoned darts row betide any interloper who made an unauthorized landing on the heli pad, they would be immediately surrounded, overpowered, and delivered to principal Gen CEOs deepest dungeons, and their helicopter smashed to smithereens. The prince was proud of his guards, who were the most devoted and violent in the land, as well as the fittest. They were each given regular breaks from duty to take part in bio Ching sessions. In addition, the prince ensured that they were all given a copy of his book, henchmen are from Mars damsels from a girly planet, which they were expected to memorize. No one could argue that the henchmen did not have a marshal bearing clanking around in their armor, shouting their heads off, and generally being intimidating. What they lacked, however, was entertainment. Principal Gen CEO himself did not understand found humor, nor high drinks, for his time on earth were spent exclusively in plotting dark and terrible deeds. He was alert, however, unrest among his murmee dawns, and it was clear that something would have to be done to appease them. He had a spy or creature like bussola in the Duchess of malfi, who mingled incognito among the henchmen to discover what secrets looked in their foul and treacherous hearts. The Spy was called George Kaplan, a name later borrowed by screenwriter Ernest Lemmon for the non existent agent in Hitchcock's North by Northwest, and he reported to the prince as follows Caplin the henchmen are becoming restive, oh Prince, Fulgencio then I shall have each of them put to death and ruin placed by other henchman Kaplan, if I might say so an unwise decision Oh Prince for the rest of your henchmen are fanatically loyal to you, and I know not where you might find they're like elsewhere from Geneseo

Frank Key  05:16
from Mars of course, have you not read my book? Kaplan? I have indeed Oh Prince many a time but, and I tread delicately here. Though you are omnipotent and wise and princely, your helicopter is not equipped to journey through space as far as other planetoids much as you might wish it, Fulgencio God blast the stars, Caplin. I'm sure he will au-prince. Meanwhile, I think that if you bring to the castle of food Lord Jester and entertainer in Captain bells, the henchmen will be placated. Principal gente owes face assumed a curdled cast, but he was pragmatic. dismissing George Kaplan with a wave of his fat and pasty hand, he sat down at his metal Tapping Machine and sent an advert to the classified section of the daily manacle. Wanted fool for amusement of henchmen a grade, you will be responsible for devising, implementing and evaluating a core strategy for tomfoolery and Japes consulting with stakeholders and demonstrating a proactive approach. The successful candidates will have a proven track record and delivering merrymaking within a goal oriented environment. The prince is working towards a castle which reflects the diversity of his earthly domain. On the day of the interviews, Principal Geneseo was sick with an attack of the seeds and bindings. So he delegated George Kaplan to weed out the chaff being a duplicitous knave, the spy appointed as Jester, a man named Selwyn pob, lagu, breus cripple of downcast air and abject gloom, and thus it was that upon hearing pubs, dodges and threat studies, delivered while dragging himself around the castle on his worm eaten crutches to henchmans unrest turn to open rebellion, and they hacked principal Gen co two pizzas with their hatchets as he like groaning in his sick bed, and his blood and gore was splattered upon the walls, and they're in the shadows, George Catlin smiled and went creeping down to the pantries where he gorged himself on cake and buns and pies and pastries and custard, until he was replete.

Frank Key  08:07
When we consider the relationship between God and humankind, we tend to think of God as the one who issued commands and decrees and use cases that mere mortals must obey, obey. Occasionally, however, it's the other way about. I have in mind the Cockney cheeky Chappie who will from time to time, exclaim, Lord, lover duck. What are we to make of this? Is our lovable scallywag telling the Lord to bestow His ineffable beneficence upon a desert denizen of the local duck pond? Or is it the case as I prefer to think of a command to God, to engage in sexual Congress with a duck? After all, there seems a little need to be telling God to direct as a bounding love upon any particular one of his creatures, for that's what he's doing with time. apart of course, from when he's smiting the sinful. It's a rare thing for a duck to require smiting for by and large ducks DO NOT SIN. But we must ask why a chirpy Stender would command God to have sex with a duck. And the answer must be in the hope that the duck falls pregnant. For Of course, a duck into whose womb wiggles a divine seed will eventually lay an egg from which will hatch not an ordinary duckling, but a being that is half duck, half God, a duck God, if you will. The sexual link between gods and aquatic bird life is not without precedent. The most famous example is probably the story of later and the swan, although they're the waters are muddied somewhat by the fact that God in the form of Zeus inhabited the body of a swan and proceeded to rape lighter, the mother of Helen of Troy, Clytemnestra, Castor and Pollux. None of the latest children either by the swan God or by her husband Kington derrius turned out to have aquatic avian characteristics. On one of his infrequent visits to Cockney haunts, Dobson overheard many ragamuffins and urchins shouting, Lord, love a duck. And he was led to wondering just how many duck gods may have been spawned, and what perhaps clashing unremarked in the pons of the city's parks. Armed with a notebook and a pencil, and some sort of pneumatic scanner device of his own invention. The out of print pamphlet here plotted around those very pawns during a wet October weekend. Sadly, he never wrote up his findings in pamphlet form, and the only record we have of his researches is a fragment from a letter marigold Chu wrote to her cousin basil

Unknown Speaker  11:07
Dobson has returned from his tour of Easton Pons. She reported, and appears to be convinced that a wigeon or baldpate he spotted clashing in a pond in illegible, had a spark of divinity about it. I argued that a mere spark was surely insufficient, and that a true duck God would be immediately recognizable as such, for it would probably emit a blinding efflorescence of heavenly majesty, and be surrounded by duckling apostles, bowed in worship of its mighty duck God, omnipotence, and of its boundless love and mercy. I added, perhaps unkindly, that Dobson's ornithological ignorance was of such an unfathomable depth, that it would not surprise me if he had mistaken a widgeon for a pigeon, and the letter not being a duck at all, his whole theory would come crashing around his ears. He took umbrage at this, and retired to his about another topic entirely.

Frank Key  12:46
Talking of Gods there's nothing quite like a bit of eye popping religious frenzy is there, and this is I'd like to read to you now. This is entirely genuine. It's part of a sermon by Anthony green, who used to be a Catholic, and has now called Abdul Rahim green because he converted to Islam. And this sermon appeared on piece TV, which is the 24 hour Islamic spiritual edutainment satellite TV channel. And I think when I read this to you, I think Anthony or Abdul Rahim never quite got over his Catholic education. Here's what he has to say. The Hellfire is a place of the most extreme suffering the most extreme pain of every level that you can imagine. physical, mental, and spiritual pain and suffering and torment is a place where Allah will burn the skins of the people, and then he will recreate their skins and burn the skins again, so that the people in there will taste the punishment. It is a place of heat, a place of pain, a place of suffering, that people will cry in agony for water. They will cry for a drink something to cool them and they will be given water. They will be given a drink but it is boiling water that will scold their faces and burn their insides. They will drink from a river, a river that is made from the past that flows out of the wounds of the people of the hellfire. The wounds of the people of the Hellfire will ooze pass, and this pass will gather together to form a river. And this is all they will have to drink. And their food will be the tree of Zakouma, a tree the fruits of which are like the heads of devils. This tree is so bitter that if the people try to eat it, they can't eat it, but they will force themselves because there is nothing else to eat. In the Hellfire, a place whether people will neither live nor will they die a place whether people will fall into despair, arguing with each other, admonishing each other, criticizing each other, the fire will surround them in every place. The smallest punishment of the Hellfire is that a person will wear a pair of sandals of fire, and their brain will boil.

A couple of other things now, for the last couple of weeks, I've interspersed the program we list there was a list of owls, types of owls and there was a list of three letter place names. similar sort of thing this week, I'd like to read you some extracts from George Orwell's diary. These are the these are the complete entries for days 50 years ago in George Orwell's diary 16th of November 1938. One egg 17th of November 1938. One egg 19th of November 1938. To eggs 21st of November 1938 to eggs 22nd of November 22 of November 1938. To eggs. We'll get back to that list. Or those entries from all well sorry, later in the program. And just something else very briefly. There's a great entry on a blog by someone called bill Paschal about Samuel Taylor Coleridge his military career. There's a link to it on the hooting yard website but it includes this, these fantastic couple of quotations from Coleridge as a writer, his attempts ended frequently in disaster, quote, within this week, I have been thrown three times for my horse and run away with to no small perturbation of my nervous system. Unquote. He developed saddle sores, quote, dreadfully troublesome eruptions, which so grimly constellated, my posteriors unquote. There's much more of the calamities of coloriages military career and this talking about the military This is a story called Conquistador. Conquistador your stallion stands in need of company for an adventurer and conqueror, especially one who led the Spanish conquest of Mexico and Peru in the 16th century. This is a lapse on your part. You should never leave your horse alone and abandoned for it's likely to become fractious. And the last thing you want to have to deal with, either in the jungles or the mountains, is a fractious horse. You might argue that a native Peruvian firing poisonous darts at youth or a blowpipe would cause you more concern than a horse in a bad mood. But there you would be wrong. Let's say that the native Peruvian aim is impeccable and his poisoned Dart plunges into your neck. It's true that you would be surprised and have only minutes to live as the toxin ravaged your innards. But it's a simple enough matter to pluck the Darth out of your flesh and have one of your fellow Conquistadores immediately suck on the puncture, drawing every last drop of poison into his mouth before spitting it out. Apply a method dissonant poultice to the tiny hole in your neck and job done. You will be drying and ready to carry on adventuring and conquering. By contrast, if after abandoning your stallion while you clanked off On foot or an errand of death, you return to find it lonely, fractious, and temperamental. You may have some difficulty getting back into your saddle, your horse may rear up on its hind legs and make terrifying bellowing noises. If you're not careful, you could end up being crushed under its mighty hooves. A fleck of horse spittle might land in your eye, blurring your vision. The rest of your Conquistador troupe may have written on ahead, leaving you behind without food or water or a compass. You will know from your training back into lado that it can take hours to become a fractious horse, by which time your chances of catching up with your fellow adventuring conquerors before nightfall are remote. Unless the Conquistador who sucked the poison out of your neck has stayed with you. You will now be all alone in a strange, exotic landscape famished, you do not you do not know which fruits and berries are safe to eat. And in any case, there will only be fruits and berries available to you. If you're in the jungle. As I pointed out

Frank Key  21:12
earlier, you might be up in the mountains and there will be little to eat but impacted snow, which you'll have to melt and soften before trying to shovel it down your throat. Bear in mind that the air is very thin up in the higher reaches of the Andes, and you will become exhausted quite rapidly, especially if you're expending energy hacking at a patch of snow to make it more easily meltable. Added to these impairments your horse will be hungry too. And it's fractiousness may return with a vengeance, you will have to find a way to placate it a second time. And by now it will be wise to your Crick's if it is a clever horse, which it probably is having been chosen out of so many other horses to go on a conquista dorial campaign. It's also much more difficult to become a frightened horse in the dark. And the Peruvian night is far more eerie than the night in Toledo, with which both you and your stallion are familiar. A further problem will present itself if a nocturnal Peruvian native fires a second poisonous Dart into your neck through a blowpipe Yes, it's simple enough for you to remove the Dart. But without a fellow Conquistador. to suck out the venom, you'll have to instruct your horse to do the deed. Not many horses are skilled in such an art. Apart from anything else, their mouths are much bigger than the average Conquistadores mouth, and their teeth are huge, so it's exceedingly difficult for them to get sufficient purchase on your neck to suck with any conviction. Of course, if you have a vampire horse, it will suck away quite happily. But after draining the poison it will continue to suck your blood until you topple over, pale and dead. All things considered Conquistador, you're advised never to leave your stallion in need of company. No horse is an island in tire of itself. Further tips on looking after your horse when adventuring and conquering in Mexico and Peru in the 16th century, are available in the government pamphlet. 50 tips for Conquistadores on looking after your horse when adventuring and conquering in Mexico and Peru in the 16th century.

Um, I've read these before but I kind of though I have not got enough material for the show for once and may So here's some here's a repeated, repeated story or two about Ugo who go lived in Plovdiv, in the fog, who go goofed off. There you go, ooh, go goofing off again said who goes ma? It was foggy. Who go stepped in some goo. He got it on his boots. Ma I've got goo on my boots said Ugo, who goes Mark gave him a rag to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a draw of Google's Google's and rags. Who goes Maher was blind so when to go goofed off and got goo on his boots. She opened the drawer of Googles and rags and rummaged feeling for a rag rather than a Google for if she gave Google a Google he wouldn't get the goo off his boots, but with a rag he would go sat in the porch after goofing off and white the goo off his boots with a rag in the fog in Plovdiv. In Plovdiv. Ooh, go had a POW called off, off had the plague. Look at my Bubo, Ugo said off, who said, ooh, go when he saw the Bubo? Ooh, go had the flu. His mom made him a tincture for his flu. But there was not much he could do about off Bubo. In the plot Dave lazaretto mooched about in a foul mood, ooh, go and ooh goes ma brought food for off. Have some pancakes off said Ooh, go off. gobble the pancake. Far be it for me to poopoo you off said who goes mad. But you should put the pancake on your Bubo, like a poultice. Oh said Oh, he did his bid. And soon his Bubo is gone. But who go still had the flu. So his mom was thrown for a loop. She could cure the plague but not the flu and did not know what else she could do. For the time being in the lazur Reto. In Plovdiv. In the Old Town of Plovdiv. Ooh, go plop it is poured onto a stool. Who goes Maher said, ooh, go, why are you using a pod instead of a jar? Who goes Mar was blind, but she knew that the clop of who goes pod was different as a plop of his jar. Omar said, ooh, go, my jar is in the shade. Who goes Mar bashed who go on their head? Never leave your jar in the shade who go she said, when you do, I will bash you on the head as I just did. Who go said sorry, Ma, my power off, put my jar in the shed. Ah, said who goes ma on Thursday last in a hovel in the old town of Plovdiv.
