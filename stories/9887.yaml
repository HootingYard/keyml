  \ poetry by Wallace Stevens, Roger Kimball turns to W H Auden and finds\nAuden often\
  \ remarked on his fondness for the Oxford English Dictionary. In later life, it\
  \ provided some of his favourite reading matter and indeed was the source of many\
  \ of the lexical curiosities that\u2014increasingly\u2014bedizened his poetry .\
  \ . . In a review of Epistle To A Godson (1972), one critic lists \u201Cblouts,\
  \ pirries, stolchy, glunch, sloomy, snudge, snoachy, scaddle, cagmag, hoasting,\
  \ drumbles\u201D, among others. How many do you know?\nFrom The Permanent Auden\
  \ by Roger Kimball, collected in Experiments Against Reality (2000).\n\n[2012-08-14]"
