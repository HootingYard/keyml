text: "Farmers\u2019 knitwear is a particularly important and engaging topic. I know\
  \ this, because I spoke to a farmer about it. He was a big, florid fellow with a\
  \ big, florid head, and he was leaning against a fence, waving a stick at some cows.\
  \ I was lost in the countryside and when I saw him, from a distance, silhouetted\
  \ against a breathtakingly gorgeous sunset, I decided to approach him at speed,\
  \ before he vanished, so I could ask him where I was.\nMere seconds later, because\
  \ I can move jolly fast when I have to, I tipped my hat to him in greeting. He was\
  \ not wearing a hat, which I thought unusual for a farmer, but what do I know of\
  \ farmers? Not much, as it turned out. For example, not only did I think all farmers\
  \ wore hats, all the time, but I had no idea they were so interested in knitwear,\
  \ and in discussing it with complete strangers lost in the countryside.\nBefore\
  \ I had a chance to ask the farmer where I was, he started talking to me about his\
  \ cardigan. It was, he explained, a farmers\u2019 cardigan, knitted from wool. See\
  \ how the length of the sleeves matches the length of my arms, he said. See how\
  \ the buttons are fastened in a straight vertical line down the middle of the cardigan\
  \ front. When I am done with my cows for the evening, he said, perhaps you would\
  \ like to come back with me to my farmhouse, where I can show you the niddy noddy\
  \ on which the wool for this cardigan was wound from the bobbin into a skein.\n\
  This was a lot for me to take in, and I am afraid my face must have betrayed a certain\
  \ hesitancy. It's all the same to me, said the farmer. And he turned back to his\
  \ cows and waved the stick at them again. I assured him I would be more than happy\
  \ to repair to the farmhouse. Already the thought had sparked in my brain that I\
  \ might stay there, eating his food and sleeping on his sofa, for weeks or months.\
  \ Then I would not need to find out where I was. I would no longer be lost, for\
  \ I would have a haven at his hearth.\nTo expedite my plan, while we trudged across\
  \ the fields towards the farmhouse, I expressed far more interest in his knitwear\
  \ than I really felt. He told me about his swift as well as his niddy noddy. I thought\
  \ he was suddenly talking about birds, but he corrected me after I mumbled something\
  \ about linnets. At one point he hoicked up his trouser-cuffs and invited me to\
  \ look at his socks. They were knit from the same batch of wool as the cardigan,\n\
  When we got to the farmhouse I fell a little behind him as he approached the door.\
  \ I saw a spade leaning against the wall, picked it up, and bashed his head in while\
  \ he was still in the doorway. Stepping over him, I went into the farmhouse kitchen\
  \ and put the kettle on for a nice reviving cuppa. There was a woolly hat hanging\
  \ from a nail on the back of the door. I knew I couldn't be completely mistaken\
  \ about farmers\u2019 hats. I took off my own hat and removed the farmer's woolly\
  \ hat from the nail and put it on my head, a smaller and less florid head than the\
  \ farmer's, adjusting it to a rakish angle. Knowing what I now knew about farmers\u2019\
  \ knitwear, I could tell it was knit from the same batch of wool as the cardigan\
  \ and the socks.\nWhen the tea was brewed I sat in the farmer's chair drinking from\
  \ the farmer's teacup. The swift and the niddy noddy stood in the kitchen corner.\
  \ The sun had set by now, and through the open doorway where the farmer's body lay,\
  \ I could hear the distant bellowing of his cows in the black and starless night.\n\
