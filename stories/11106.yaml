text: 'after darting from where he sat a few invigorating glances over the river-meadows
  to the blue mountains beyond, Pierre made a masonic sort of mysterious motion to
  the excellent Dates, who in automaton obedience thereto, brought from a certain
  agreeable little side-stand, a very prominent-looking cold pasty; which, on careful
  inspection with the knife, proved to be the embossed savory nest of a few uncommonly
  tender pigeons of Pierre''s own shooting.
