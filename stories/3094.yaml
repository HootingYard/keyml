text: "Last week Sludge Hall Farm hosted the Bodger's Spinney Travelling Players,\
  \ a troupe of bodkin- and whisk-wielding theatrical persons famed for their reconstructions\
  \ of historical episodes. Their current production, the one that had the Sludge\
  \ Hall Farm yokels gawping, was a dramatisation of the first Blunkett resignation\
  \ of 2004. That was the one where, relinquishing the post of Home Secretary, our\
  \ hero went on television and spoke mawkishly, tearfully, and repeatedly about \u201C\
  the little lad\u201D, a bit of homespun phraseology designed to tug the heartstrings\
  \ of the nation. It certainly had that effect on the Sludge Hall Farm farmhands,\
  \ at least when acted by Bodger's Spinney's most accomplished thespian, Vlasto Harbinge.\
  \ The racket made by the peasants\u2019 copious sobbing almost drowned out the closing\
  \ peroration by the chorus.\nIn order to have sufficient pretext for wielding their\
  \ bodkins and whisks, the Players set their Blunkettorama in the fourteenth century.\
  \ This also allowed them to incorporate the gruesome battle scenes for which they\
  \ have become notorious. In a particularly splendid segment, the Home Secretary's\
  \ trusty guide dog Ruby\u2014or possibly Teddy or Offa or Lucy or Sadie\u2014single-pawedly\
  \ fought off a pack of rabid wolves egged on by spectral wolfmen armed with the\
  \ requisite bodkins and whisks. It was extremely exciting and convincing, and, at\
  \ the curtain call, the costume designer was hauled on to the stage to receive a\
  \ bouquet. Sludge Hall Farm being the kind of farm it is, her gift was one of nettles\
  \ and bindweed, but no less welcome for that.\n\u201CThe Bodger's Spinney Travelling\
  \ Players With Vlasto Harbinge Present The First And Most Traumatic Of The Resignations\
  \ From Ministerial Office Of David Blunkett MP, The Elected Member For Sheffield\
