  this curious claim:\n\nIt had never before occurred to me that, when seeking to\
  \ identify birds\u2019 eggs, the first port of call should be a PayPal customer\
  \ services person. However, now I know, and I shall be bombarding them with all\
  \ my birds\u2019 egg identification quandaries. You should do likewise.\nADDENDUM\_\
  : While you're there checking your birds\u2019 eggs, don't forget to give alms to\
  \ the Hooting Yard Fighting Fund. (I'm not sure yet who or what we're fighting,\
  \ but don't you worry about that.)\n[2012-01-31]"
