text: "I wanted butter more than I wanted guns. I have always been partial to dairy\
  \ products, cows\u2019 milk and yoghurt for example, but my greed for butter had\
  \ become all-consuming. I was mad for it and could think of little else. So one\
  \ grim overcast morning I set out for the nearest dairy, knocked at the gate, and\
  \ demanded butter. The dairyman, of great bulk and threatening mien, refused me\
  \ butter and shooed me away as he might shoo away a gnat.\nBroken in spirit, I lolloped\
  \ into a tavern. A cad with a pencil moustache and a battered briefcase was propping\
  \ up the bar. He asked what ailed me, and I explained.\n\u201CLet me give you a\
  \ tip,\u201D he said, \u201CI know about these things. The best way for you to obtain\
  \ butter from that dairyman is to threaten him with a gun. If you went back, and\
  \ demanded butter, while aiming at the centre of his forehead a fully loaded Mannlicher-Carcano\
  \ rifle, I think you'd find he would hand over as much butter as you want in a jiffy.\u201D\
  \nThis was a persuasive argument, but I told the cad that I had neither a Mannlicher-Carcano\
  \ rifle nor any other type of gun.\n\u201CThat's where you're in luck,\u201D he\
  \ replied, \u201CFor it just so happens that I am an international arms dealer and\
  \ I can lay my hands on any type of gun you want at the drop of a hat. It will cost\
  \ you, of course, but think about the butter!\u201D\nI was won over, and I scuttled\
  \ home to fetch from under my bed the shoebox containing my worldly wealth. It was\
  \ not a great sum, but I hoped it would be enough for a rifle. As I made my way\
  \ back to the tavern, a little birdie\u2014I think it way have been a peewit or\
  \ a grebe\u2014perched on my shoulder and chattered in my ear. What it said, had\
  \ I been able to translate its twittering, was \u201CWhy don't you give the money\
  \ directly to the dairyman as payment for his butter?\u201D But I was ignorant of\
  \ the language of birds and I brushed it away without understanding.\nThe cad was\
  \ still propping up the bar and he accepted my shoebox of cash after counting it\
  \ carefully.\n\u201CObviously,\u201D he said, \u201CAs a gun runner I have to be\
  \ cautious. Meet me under the viaduct at nightfall and I will give you a fully loaded\
  \ Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.\u201D\n\u201CBut I want my butter before then!\u201D\
  \ I wailed, \u201CThat's the whole point! I want butter before guns!\u201D\nThe\
  \ cad looked at me with some sympathy.\n\u201CWell,\u201D he said, \u201CWhy not\
  \ go back to the dairy and explain to the dairyman that if he doesn't hand over\
  \ his butter there and then you will come back after nightfall armed with a fully\
  \ loaded Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and you will shoot him through the centre of his\
  \ forehead, without mercy. That ought to buck his ideas up.\u201D\n\u201CGood idea!\u201D\
  \ I said, and I scampered off to the dairy, happy and hopeful.\nI knocked at the\
  \ gate and explained myself to the dairyman. I expected him at once to be cowed,\
  \ and to fetch butter for me. But instead, he took from his pocket a handgun and\
  \ shot me, several times, in the legs and arms.\nAs I lay sprawled in the mud outside\
  \ the dairy gate, waiting for an ambulance to come clanging, the peewit or grebe\
  \ landed on my head and began chattering into my ear. Before I passed out, I resolved\
  \ to learn the language of birds.\n[Should you prefer guns before butter, go to\
