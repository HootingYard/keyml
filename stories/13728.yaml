text: "In his posthumously published essay How I Wrote Certain Of My Books, Raymond\
  \ Roussel explained the methods he used to compose the works which, he was confident,\
  \ would guarantee him immortality, such that \u201Cmy fame will outshine that of\
  \ Victor Hugo or Napoleon\u201D. It was perhaps with the same ambition in mind that\
  \ the itinerant Bible-bashing tub-thumping fire-and- brimstone preacherman Napkin\
  \ Linseed paraphrased the title for his memoir How I Thumped Certain Of My Tubs.\
  \ Happily, it was published while he was still alive.\nLinseed is an attractive\
  \ figure, if one is attracted to rakishly thin black-clad figures of decidedly corvine\
  \ countenance who discern the foul besmirchment of mortal sin everywhere they look.\
  \ His personality comes across with striking force in his memoir, a book as fat\
  \ as he was lean. In it, he describes in fascinating detail how he devised his tub-thumping\
  \ method, though he has less to say about the bashing of Bibles. The book is highly\
  \ recommended to any reader who wishes to embark upon their own tub-thumping practice,\
  \ as Linseed gives chapter and verse on the procurement and preparation of tubs,\
  \ the most effective ways to transport them\u2014one slung on either side of a horse's\
  \ shanks\u2014and, of course, various approaches to thumping guaranteed to both\
  \ deafen and terrify one's audience, if, of course, one manages to attract an audience.\
  \ Often enough, this was the missing element in Linseed's preaching tours. The memoir\
  \ contains innumerable descriptions of the author standing in a rainswept field,\
  \ thumping his tubs and bashing his Bibles and hurling damnable imprecations at\
  \ nobody save for the occasional passing cow or goat. It is perhaps his most attractive\
  \ feature that Linseed never allowed himself to be discouraged by the widespread\
  \ lack of interest shown in his preaching. He simply kept on going, like a swordfish\
  \ spearing the briny deep.\nI use that somewhat ungainly analogy in homage to Napkin\
  \ Linseed himself, who deploys it repeatedly in his memoir. In some instances it\
  \ appears several times in a single paragraph, and in general the paragraphs themselves\
  \ are fairly short and snappy\u2014certainly shorter and snappier than in his only\
  \ other published work, How I Bashed Certain Of My Bibles.\nAt time of writing,\
  \ Napoleon's fame probably outshines Victor Hugo's, Hugo's outshines Raymond Roussel's,\
  \ and Roussel's outshines Napkin Linseed's. But who is to say that, in a thousand\
  \ years\u2019 time, the order may not be reversed?\n[2015-01-26]"
