text: "[F. J. Furnivall (1825\u20131910)] was\u2026 besides being a redoubtable scholar\
  \ himself, one of the great rock-blasting entrepreneurs of Victorian scholarship,\
  \ the kind of man who if his energies had taken another turn might have covered\
  \ a continent with railways. As secretary of the Philological Society, he spent\
  \ twenty years amassing materials for the New (Oxford) English Dictionary, of which\
  \ he was one of the first editors; as founder of the Early English Texts Society,\
  \ he performed an indispensable service for medievalists. Societies were his natural\
  \ element. Apart from the E.E.T.S., he also founded the New Shakespere Society [he\
  \ insisted on spelling it that way], the Ballad Society, the Chaucer Society, the\
  \ Wycliffe Society, the Shelley Society, the Browning Society. It is a measure of\
  \ his optimism that he even tried to start a Lydgate Society, though it failed to\
  \ get off the ground\u2026\n\nThere are times when it is impossible not to applaud\
  \ his fighting spirit, or marvel at his vitality. Like the young Shakespeare, he\
  \ was a lithe and active fellow; at the age of seventy he had enough surplus energy\
  \ left to found the Hammersmith Sculling Club for Girls and Men, and he was still\
  \ turning out with them on the river every Sunday at the age of eighty-five. He\
  \ was also an ardent old-fashioned socialist, who refused to be bound by snobbish\
  \ convention. It is characteristic that the memorial volume published after his\
  \ death should have contained, along with contributions by scholars from all over\
  \ the world, a simple tribute from a waitress in the ABC tea-shop in Oxford Street\
  \ where he used to hold court.\nfrom The Rise And Fall Of The Man Of Letters by\
  \ John Gross (1969)\n[2012-05-27]"
