  \ moonlighting over at the Dictionary of National Biography, or have they been somehow\
  \ stealing your unpublished works? The following DNB entry is a blatant fiction,\
  \ and its Hooting Yard origins manifest, I would say:\n\u201CCowley, Sir John Guise\
  \ (1905\u20131993), army officer, was born at Mussooree, in the foothills of the\
  \ Himalayas, during an earthquake on 20 August 1905, the son of the Revd Henry Guise\
  \ Beatson Cowley, army chaplain, and his wife, Ethel Florence (n\xE9e Prowse). When\
  \ the family returned to England by ship John won a contest for the ugliest baby\
  \ on board. His early years were spent in a Dorset village, where his father was\
  \ the rector and Thomas Hardy was a neighbour. He recalled Hardy as a sad, wizened\
  \ old man who spoke seldom but who occasionally, though an atheist, attended church\
  \ services, at which he always asked Cowley's father to read the same passage from\
  \ the Bible\u2014Elijah's vision of the earthquake.\u201D\n[2010-04-29]"
