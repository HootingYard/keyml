text: 'Broadsword calling Danny Boy . . . Broadsword calling Danny Boy . . . But from
  Danny Boy comes no word, for he has become muddle-headed, and sped off in a bonny
  boat over the sea to Skye. One must not be equally muddle-headed, and confuse that
  Skye with the blue, blue Tyrolean sky beneath which, dressed all in white, the better
  to camouflage himself, Broadsword perches on an Alpine mountain declivity, calling,
  calling, hopelessly, into his radio transmitter.

  The mountain slopes are thick with Nazis. The pipes, the pipes are calling. The
  Nazis, too, now, are muddle-headed, and they follow the dulcet tooting of the pipes,
  like children following the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

  Broadsword is safe from the Nazis for the time being. He packs up his radio transmitter
  and hoists it on his back and carries it down, down, to a janitorial shed near the
  railway tracks. Above, in the blue, blue sky, an eagle swoops. The eagle is neither
  Broadsword nor Danny Boy. It is an eagle with no name, just as in America, far from
  the Tyrol, there is a horse with no name, just as, here, coming into the janitorial
  shed, to join Broadsword, is the Man with No Name.

  Later there will be much gunfire.
