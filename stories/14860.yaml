text: "Some years ago, Outa_Spaceman described Hooting Yard thus: \u201Ca world of\
  \ heroic infants rubbing shoulders with tugboat captains, extravagantly bouffanted\
  \ composers drinking and fighting in seedy dockside taverns, Jesuit priests lurking\
  \ in kiosks on abandoned seaside piers, bat gods haunting abandoned potato research\
  \ stations, huge grunting ogres drinking from cisterns in horrible caves, and where\
  \ diktats are being issued to Community Learning Hubs by suburban shamans\u201D\
  . Rereading this, recently, I thought to myself, \u201CHow right he is!\u201D. But\
  \ then I thought, \u201CHmm. We have not seen many tugboat captains hereabouts of\
  \ late!\u201D. My thoughts are not always followed by exclamation marks, but those\
  \ two were.\nCasting around in my mind for a tugboat captain I could tell you about,\
  \ I recalled the skipper of the tugboat Blavatsky. This fellow was neurasthenic\
  \ and highly-strung, character traits which are quite undesirable in a tugboat captain,\
  \ and led to several unfortunate episodes. Big majestic ships being tugged by the\
  \ Blavatsky suffered a series of minor and major calamities, from dents below the\
  \ plimsoll line to scuppering upon sandbanks to attacks by enormous flocks of deranged\
  \ guillemots. These incidents were not always the result of the tugboat skipper's\
  \ mental weakness, but whether he was responsible or no, when the big ships\u2019\
  \ captains gathered in conclave they laid the blame firmly at his door.\n\u201C\
  He is neurasthenic and highly-strung,\u201D they said, \u201CHe cannot be allowed\
  \ to tug our ships.\u201D\nWith no big majestic ships to tug, the Blavatsky lost\
  \ its purpose, and so too did its skipper. He took to traipsing the deck of the\
  \ tugboat wailing and keening, driving the rest of the crew crackers. Eventually\
  \ his second-in-command, the science officer, took him aside, bundled him into a\
  \ cabin, and gave him a talking-to. Like several seconds-in-command, he was half-Vulcan,\
  \ with pointy ears, and he spoke with compelling logic.\n\u201CThe Blavatsky is\
  \ a tugboat, Captain,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd therefore it must tug something.\
  \ If we cannot tug big majestic ships we will have to find something else to tug.\u201D\
  \n\u201CBut what?, dammit, what?\u201D yelled the skipper, who was clearly close\
  \ to the end of his already frayed tether.\n\u201CWell, Captain,\u201D replied his\
  \ pointy-eared science officer, \u201CIt so happens I have been reading some back\
  \ numbers of the Daily Pony Predations Digest. It seems there is, loose in the land,\
  \ but happily close to the coast, an enormous squid named Neville Mossop. It is\
  \ already responsible for slobberingly devouring one twee little pony, and logically\
  \ one must assume it will go on to consume others in its awful hideous Lovecraftian\
  \ manner. We can stop it, Captain. I suggest we send a landing party, capture the\
  \ squid, drag it to shore, then attach it to our tugboat with chains, and tug it\
  \ far out to sea so it can no longer prey upon ponies.\u201D\n\u201CThat's a fantastic\
  \ idea!\u201D cried the skipper, and at once his mood lifted and he ceased keening.\n\
  Without further ado, he sent a landing party which captured the squid, dragged it\
  \ to shore, attached it to the tugboat with chains, and tugged it far out to sea.\n\
  \u201CThis is terrific!\u201D said the skipper, \u201CWe are tugging something,\
  \ just as a tugboat must, if it is fit to be called a tugboat!\u201D\nBut his joy\
  \ was short-lived. For unbeknown to the skipper, far out at sea the enormous squid's\
  \ distressed mother was searching for her son. Mrs Chlorine Winslow Mossop was so\
  \ gigantic a giant squid that she made Neville look like a mere minnow. And when\
  \ she found him, she reared up from beneath the waves, towering over the tugboat,\
  \ her tentacles thrashing violently, and from suckers on those tentacles she emitted\
  \ an eldritch viscous goo that burned through the iron chains tugging her son as\
  \ if they were wisps of straw, and she freed him. And then, with a horrible gurgling\
  \ noise so loud it made the sun shake in the heavens, she slobberingly devoured\
  \ the tugboat Blavatsky and its crew, in a single awful gulp.\nIt happened that\
  \ at the very last second, just as he was about to be swallowed up, the skipper\
  \ managed somehow to kick himself clear. He swam away, as the gigantic squid and\
  \ her almost as gigantic son disappeared into the chthonic depths of the broiling\
  \ sea. He swam and swam, until he reached a remote atoll. Exhausted, he clung to\
  \ the rock and slowly, agonisingly, pulled himself up out of the sloshing sea. He\
  \ was marooned, but no longer imperilled.\nIn spite of his highly-strung neurasthenia,\
  \ the skipper was a resourceful fellow, and he kept himself alive by drinking rainwater\
  \ and eating barnacles and the occasional guillemot which plummeted unaccountably\
  \ from the sky. And he kept his mind busy by studying, from memory, Catholic theology,\
  \ to the point where one day, several years after his maroonment, he felt able to\
  \ ordain himself as a Jesuit priest.\nAnd that, children, is the story of how the\
  \ legendary Atoll Jesuit came to hold sway over a remote stretch of the vast and\
  \ merciless sea. Amen.\n[2016-09-03]"
