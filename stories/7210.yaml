text: "Phew! This lobster research is pretty hectic, I can tell you. Progress is slow\u2014\
  I still know almost nothing about lobsters\u2014but I have been indefatigable in\
  \ tracking down promising materials.\nTo start with, I am awaiting delivery of this\
  \ book. When postie totters up the path clutching it in its cardboard packaging,\
  \ I shall tear it out of his hands and read it from cover to cover. Having done\
  \ so, I hope I shall know a hell of a lot more about lobsters than I do at the moment.\n\
  But of course only a weedy milksop type of researcher would rely on a single source.\
  \ I have also been poring over the online catalogue of the London Library, looking\
  \ specifically for books with the word \u201Clobster\u201D in the title, and on\
  \ my next visit, later in the week, I intend to borrow some or all of these works.\
  \ There is Elisabeth Townsend's Lobster\_: A Global History (2011), Consider The\
  \ Lobster & Other Essays by David Foster Wallace (2007), and Lucullus ; or, Palatable\
  \ essays\_: in which are merged \u201CThe oyster,\u201D \u201CThe lobster,\u201D\
  \ and \u201CSport and its pleasures\u201D by the author of \u201CThe Queen's messenger,\u201D\
  \ \u201CThe bric-\xE0-brac hunter,\u201D &c., an 1878 volume by Herbert Byng Hall.\
  \ Then we have The Cosmographical Lobster\_: a poetic novel by Henri Chopin (1976)\
  \ and Phantom Lobster\_: A True Story by Leo Walmsley (1933). I think I shall also\
  \ borrow Crab, shrimp, and lobster lore\_: gathered amongst the rocks at the sea-shore,\
  \ by the riverside, and in the forest by W.B. Lord (1867). By the time I have read\
  \ that lot, I think I will have learned quite a bit about lobsters.\nMore than I\
  \ learned, in any case, from a website to which I was directed by Miss Dimity Cashew\
  \ (aka Pansy Cradledew). Miss Cashew is of the opinion that I am wrong, wrong, wrong\
  \ in my conviction that there might be such a thing as an \u201Cintelligent lobster\u201D\
  . Thus she roamed around Het Internet until she found a site which, she thought,\
  \ would knock some sense into my cranium. Here we read that\na lobster has a brain\
  \ the size of a grasshopper's. The lobster brain is primarily just a collection\
  \ of ganglia, or nerve endings. It's evident from the lobster brain's lack of complexity\
  \ that a lobster does not do much deep thinking.\nThat is all very well, but I would\
  \ lay greater trust in half a dozen books from the London Library than in a webpage\
  \ of \u201CRiddles, Trivia, and More\u201D. We shall return to this subject when\
  \ I have done some reading.\n[2011-09-06]"
