text: "Eleven years ago, I devoted an episode of Hooting Yard On The Air to reading\
  \ out a list of 601 birds, plus an astronomer, a newsreader, 2 jazzmen, 5 film directors,\
  \ and 34 stars of stage and screen. This recording\u2014hugely significant both\
  \ culturally and ornithologically\u2014has now been made readily available, split\
  \ into three parts by dint of YouTubeosity. I strongly advise you lot to listen\
  \ to the whole thing, repeatedly, umpteen times a day, until you have it committed\
  \ to memory. You will find it invaluable next time you are leaning insouciantly\
  \ against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party and there is a lull in\
  \ the conversation.\n[2017-11-20]"
