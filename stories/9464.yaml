  \ length; mosquito nets no protection; gnats bite all night allowing no sleep.\n\
  10/21\_: Another sleepless night on account of blood-sucking gnats.\n10/22\_: My\
  \ body mass of bumps from insect bites, wrists and hands swollen from bites of tiny\
  \ gnats. 2 nights with almost no sleep\u2014simply terrible. Rain during noon, all\
  \ afternoon and most of night. My shoes have been soaked since starting. Worst ticks\
  \ so far.\n10/23\_: Horrible night with worst biting gnats yet; even smoke of no\
  \ avail.\n10/24: More than half ill from insects. Wrists and hands swollen. Paint\
  \ limbs with iodine.\n10/25\_: Arose to find termites covering everything left on\
  \ the ground. Blood-sucking gnats still with us.\n10/30\_: Sweat bees, gnats and\
  \ \u201Cpolverinahs\u201D (blood-sucking gnats) terrible.\n11/2\_: My right eye\
  \ is sadly blurred by gnats.\n11/3\_: Bees and gnats worse than ever; truly \u201C\
  there's no rest for the weary\u201D.\n11/5\_: My first experience with flesh- and\
  \ carrion-eating bees. Biting gnats in clouds\u2014very worst we have encountered\u2014\
  rendering one's food unpalatable by filling it with their filthy bodies, their bellies\
  \ red and disgustingly distended with one's own blood.\nfrom the 1920 Amazonian\
