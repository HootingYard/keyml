  \ asking punters \u201CWhich blog with the word \u2018Hooting\u2019 in its title\
  \ do you think keeps its finger most firmly on the pulse of the global body politic?\u201D\
  \ Many thanks to the untold billions of readers who voted for us. Commemorative\
  \ biros will be in the post shortly (ink not included).\nSometimes, however, one\
  \ has to hike elsewhere to find out what's really going on, as airheads and conspiracy\
  \ theorists like to put it. So today you had better open the door of my cupboard\
  \ in The Dabbler, where the current unrest in Libya is fully and cogently analysed\
  \ through the prism of some Libyan proverbs.\n[2011-04-08]"
