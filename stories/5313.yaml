  \ suppose we should expect the words of politicians to be particularly piffle-strewn.\
  \ Consider this, reported in today's Grauniad:\n\u201COne of his shadow cabinet\
  \ allies insisted Ed Miliband was growing in stature as a leader by the hour.\u201D\
  \nBy the hour? He became the Labour Party leader on Saturday afternoon, and if we\
  \ grant that to get elected in the first place he must already have demonstrated\
  \ just a teensiest smidgen of leadership quality, what on earth must he be like\
  \ by now, and what will he be like in a week's and a month's time? Assuming the\
  \ next general election takes place in 2015, and his stature continues to grow by\
  \ the hour, he will have become a mighty potentate, a modern Ozymandias, King of\
  \ Kings!\n\nYoung Ned Miliband, soon-to-be Supreme And Majestic Potentate Of The\
  \ Universe\n[2010-09-28]"
