text: "Once upon a time, I was scrabbling down the lower reaches of a mountainside,\
  \ through shingle and scumble and bracken, when I chanced upon a tosspot's bivouac.\
  \ It was a surprisingly well-made bivouac, using branches from larch and beech and\
  \ bladdernut and sycamore trees to form a roof upon which sufficient foliage had\
  \ been empacted to provide sterling shelter from hailstorms and tempests, although\
  \ the weather was in fact spectacularly clement. Clement, too, was the name of the\
  \ tosspot, as I soon learned, for I immediately struck up a conversation with him,\
  \ as is my habit when I encounter mountainside people.\nI learned that he had taken\
  \ to his bivouac after fleeing. Fleeing from what?, I asked, but he seemed reluctant\
  \ to tell me. Someone with a less acute insight into human nature than I may have\
  \ put this down to coyness, but I spent many years studying under Glaggy and Dampster,\
  \ so I knew there was more than simple shyness behind his diffident mutterings,\
  \ and I determined to winkle the full story out of him.\nSo I grabbed the tosspot\
  \ around the neck with one of my huge bear-like hands, lifted him off his feet,\
  \ and shook my other huge bear-like hand, made into a fist, in front of his face.\
  \ As Dampster taught, by attuning one's fist-shaking to a very precise rhythm, the\
  \ half-strangled subject is quickly placed in what Glaggy termed a \u201Cconfessional\
  \ brain-zone\u201D, akin to having been injected with a truth serum. As I suggested,\
  \ it took years of training to perfect the technique, and I am afraid a large number\
  \ of fully-strangled hamsters and stoats lie buried in the grounds of the Institute.\n\
  Five minutes later I was fully apprised of the reasons why the tosspot had fled\
  \ to his mountainside bivouac. He had been employed as an extra in a heist film\
  \ set on a submarine. Sterling Hayden may have been involved in the production,\
  \ but this was not entirely clear. What came shining through the tosspot's account,\
  \ however, was the claustrophobic atmosphere on the set, which was actually a real,\
  \ decommissioned submarine. The tenebrous, leaking interior had been slightly refurbished\
  \ to include heist movie essentials like an intricate security system and a safe\
  \ full of gold bullion, but otherwise it remained cramped and hot and riddled with\
  \ clanking machinery. After six days filming, during which time he had to lean against\
  \ a damaged pump looking mordant, the tosspot had cracked. Tearing off his submariner's\
  \ green tunic and cap, he stumbled out of the submarine, swam to the surface of\
  \ the tank in which it was docked, scrambled up a ladder to the studio canteen,\
  \ and fled, until he reached the mountainside, where with unaccustomed competence\
  \ he constructed his bivouac using already fallen branches from larch and beech\
  \ and bladdernut and sycamore trees, and the foliage thereof, where I bumped into\
  \ him as I scrambled down from the mountain peak, upon which I had been making an\
  \ invaluable study of the nesting habits of the mountain lopwit.\nLater I was to\
  \ discover that the continuity person on the film set, distraught at the vanishing\
  \ of Clement the tosspot, and unable to find anyone of a similar physiognomy to\
  \ lean against the damaged pump, advised the producer to abandon the project. It\
  \ remained unclear whether this producer was Sterling Hayden, or possibly Hume Cronyn.\
  \ Either way, the film was never finished.\nI put down the tosspot and gave him\
  \ a look of reproach, and then I carried on down the mountainside in sadness and\
  \ sorrow.\n[2008-01-13]"
