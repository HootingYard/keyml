text: "\nThis intriguing snapshot was taken exactly one hundred tears ago today in\
  \ the Big Hangar At Pointy Town, a big hangar in Pointy Town. We can see a number\
  \ of people, now all dead, standing or milling about, and, with a single exception,\
  \ not one of them is paying attention to the large and mysterious crate. The group\
  \ slap bang next to the crate is peering past it, at something else, we know not\
  \ what. Others are seen walking past, as if oblivious. In the foreground, however,\
  \ we see a diminutive figure, possibly a curious infant, who seems to want to move\
  \ towards the crate but is being bustled away by its guardian or governess, dressed\
  \ in hood and cape.\nCan it be that the tiny one, alone of those in the hangar,\
  \ knew what the crate contained, was attracted to it by invisible forces the nature\
  \ of which must remain to us as mysterious as the crate itself? Some say this snap\
  \ is the sole evidence of the arrival in Pointy Town of the Grunty Man. For it is\
  \ thought that, with uncharacteristic cunning, he had himself concealed in the crate\
  \ and shipped across the mighty oceans, from the pestilential land that spawned\
  \ him to the fair shores of our own continent!\nIf this is so, we are compelled\
  \ to ask\u2014who was that infant? And what became of them? Answers on a postcard,\
  \ please.\n(Snap spotted at Ptak Science Books)\n[2011-01-01]"
