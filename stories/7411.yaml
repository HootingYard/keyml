text: "\nIf, like me, you intend to spend the autumn in the great outdoors, entented\
  \ at Camp Dabbler, be sure to read the by no means exhaustive list of Victorian\
  \ camping gear stowed in my cupboard this week.\nUseful as the list is, it raises\
  \ a number of questions. The following puzzlers spring to mind, though I have not\
  \ yet been able to come up with answers.\nWhich version of the Bible is best suited\
  \ for a camping trip?\nHow many boxes should one pack, and of what kind?\nWhich\
  \ is the most effective oil to apply to one's Brogans?\nWhy is the harness the sole\
  \ item on the list which one should examine, presumably before the start of the\
  \ camping trip? Are we to assume that all the other things can be shoved willy nilly\
  \ into one's camping pantechnicon without them being given the once over with a\
  \ gimlet eye?\n\u201CMeal (in bag). Meal-bag.\u201D Does this mean the properly\
  \ prepared camper should take two meal-bags, one containing meal and one empty?\
  \ Or is the repetition designed to hammer the point home for the camping dunderpate,\
  \ much as one hammers home the pegs of the dunderpate's tent?\nRegarding pens, should\
  \ one take ballpoints (with tips about the size of a lobster's brain) or thick black\
  \ magic markers, or fountain pens, or indeed swans?\nNo particular song-book is\
  \ recommended, and it would be helpful to have some idea of the kind of songs one\
  \ might be expected to sing while hunched around the fire at Camp Dabbler.\nIf any\
  \ readers can help out with these, or other camping-related questions thrown up\
  \ by the list, please use the Comments facility.\n[2011-10-14]"
