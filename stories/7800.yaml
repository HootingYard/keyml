  \ started reading his earlier life of Dennis Wheatley, The Devil Is A Gentleman\
  \ (2009). It is as informative, entertaining, and amusing as the Spare book. Here\
  \ is Dennis, reminiscing about his visit to Germany in 1913 to learn about the family\
  \ wine trade. He was much impressed by the officer class\u2026\n\u2026 a race apart,\
  \ immune from arrest by the police, they could be tried only by their own courts\
  \ of honour and, if found guilty of a disgraceful act, they were simply given a\
  \ pistol with which to shoot themselves. The civilian population had been conditioned\
  \ to regard them with abject veneration. Ladies, as well as men, when approaching\
  \ one of them in a street, stepped off the pavement into the gutter to give them\
  \ ample room to pass, which they accepted as their right and did not even acknowledge\
  \ by the flicker of an eyelid. Awed, and admiring, I watched them greet one another\
  \ with a graceful salute, a click of the heels and a sharp bow from the waist. It\
  \ was years later before I realised that very few of them had any brains at all\
