text: 'Readers will know that from time to time I find inspiration from cryptic crosswords.
  For decades, it has been my daily habit to tackle the Guardian crossword, with occasional
  forays into those of other newspapers. Today I have been particularly impressed
  by 4 Across in the Guardian. The clue reads:

  Incidents where git punches crusty things behind back of cafe (8)

  I have not yet solved this, but while it is fresh in my mind I thought it useful
  to transcribe it here, mostly as an aide memoire to myself. You lot can look forward
  to an examination of such incidents in a forthcoming sweeping paragraph of majestic
  prose.
