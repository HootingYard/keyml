text: "Harold Nicolson's diary, this day in 1932:\nThere is a dead and drowned mouse\
  \ in the lily-pond. I feel like that mouse\u2014static, obese and decaying. Vita\
  \ is calm, comforting and considerate. And yet (for have I not been reading a batch\
  \ of insulting press-cuttings?) life is a drab and dreary thing. I have missed it.\
  \ I have made a fool of myself in every respect.\nSurely there was a time I might\
  \ have trod\n    The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance\n    Struck one\
  \ clear chord to reach the ears of God?\nVery glum. Discuss finance. Vita keeps\
  \ on saying that we have got enough to go on with. But when one goes into it, that\
  \ represents only two months. I must get a job. Yet all the jobs which pay humiliate.\
  \ And the decent jobs do not pay. Come back to Long Barn. Arrange my books sadly.\
  \ Weigh myself sadly. Have put on eight pounds. Feel ashamed of myself, of my attainments,\
  \ and my character. Am I a serious person at all? Vita thinks I should make \xA3\
  2,000 by writing a novel. I don't. The discrepancy between these two theories causes\
  \ me some distress of mind.\n[2013-01-31]"
