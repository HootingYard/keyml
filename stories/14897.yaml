text: "In order to fully appreciate (White Man) In Hammersmith Palais, a song written\
  \ and recorded by The Clash in 1978, we must get a firm grasp upon the words in\
  \ the title. Before we do so, let me be quite clear that I am going to pay no attention\
  \ whatsoever to the parentheses. In my view\u2014and I grant that I may be in error\
  \ here\u2014placing \u201CWhite Man\u201D in parentheses is a mere affectation,\
  \ and has no significance whatsoever. The truth of this can be underlined by removing\
  \ the parentheses and judging if it makes any difference. Thus, (White Man) In Hammersmith\
  \ Palais, or\u2014pfft!, there!, gone!\u2014White Man In Hammersmith Palais. I challenge\
  \ anybody to insert a very very thin thing, like a cigarette paper, between the\
  \ two. We may now press on, indomitably.\nWhite. What do we mean by white? Is it\
  \ a colour or, as some would have it, the absence of colour? The white of an egg\u2014\
  the albumen\u2014is more translucent than white, in its raw state. But fry the egg,\
  \ in a pan, and voila!, it is indeed white. By the way, it would be a mistake to\
  \ infer from this that all fried things are white. Most are not.\nTo gain a sense\
  \ of overwhelming whiteness, it is well worth reading the closing passages of The\
  \ Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe. If you read it\
  \ while drinking a glass of milk, the effect of whiteness will be redoubled. If,\
  \ in addition, you tip the entire contents of a tub of talcum powder over your head\
  \ and look up from your book, from time to time, into a mirror, you will be left\
  \ in no doubt about what white means.\nNext, Man. Man is the male of the species\
  \ homo sapiens. In most cases, he is a biped, but not invariably. For example, Ian\
  \ Anderson, the front man\u2014man!\u2014of the band Jethro Tull, prefers to stand\
  \ on one leg when playing his flute. He is thus, at least temporarily, a monopod.\n\
  What else can we say, usefully, about a man? Well, for one thing, we can differentiate\
  \ between types of men (plural) by placing a qualifying adjective before \u201C\
  man\u201D. This might be in the form of prefix jammed up against \u201Cman\u201D\
  , with no space between, as for example \u201CFrenchman\u201D or \u201Cpostman\u201D\
  , or it might be a discrete, separate, interchangeable word, as in \u201Cgrunty\
  \ man\u201D or \u201Cstricken man\u201D.\nOff the coast of England there is a place\
  \ called the Isle of Man, but we had better avoid that, particularly as its flag\
  \ is a triskelion of three armoured legs. That is one and a half standard issue\
  \ bipedal men, or three Jethro Tull flautists, the thought of which begins to dizzy\
  \ the brain.\nIn we can dispatch fairly rapidly. It is a short word indicating that\
  \ something is contained within something else, for example the talcum powder was\
  \ in the tub before we upended it over our head. Now, the talcum powder is no longer\
  \ in the tub. It really is as simple as that. Just be careful not to confuse in\
  \ with inn. The latter is a tavern or hostelry. If a man enters one, parched and\
  \ thirsty and covered in talcum powder, he is said to be in an inn. Conversely,\
  \ if he engages in fisticuffs with another customer, because he is teased for being\
  \ covered in talcum powder, he risks being thrown out of the inn. The chances of\
  \ this happening are more likely if, in the inn, he drinks a sufficient quantity\
  \ of beer to be in his cups. This does not mean he is literally inside a cup, or\
  \ several cups, as the plural suggests. It is a figure of speech.\nWe are not going\
  \ to go further down the road of figures of speech, because quite frankly it is\
  \ exasperating enough having to explain all this stuff to you, just so you can grasp\
  \ fully the title of a punk single from almost forty years ago. I have better things\
  \ to do with my time. So let us wrap this up as soon as we can.\nHammersmith. This\
  \ is a proper name, referring to an area of London. London is usually pronounced\
  \ Lund'n, but for amusement's sake it is better pronounced as it looks, with the\
  \ two \u201Con\u201Ds equally stressed as if one were saying the word on. This is\
  \ particularly the case when responding to queries from tourists vacantly wandering\
  \ the streets of London. Now, natives of London may well pronounce Hammersmith as\
  \ Ammersmiff, depending on their social class. As the son of a globe-trotting Foreign\
  \ Office diplomat, Joe Strummer, the front man of The Clash, would have been brought\
  \ up to say Hammersmith rather than Ammersmiff.\nIncidentally, I hope I did not\
  \ give the impression, earlier, that all front men in bands stand on one leg while\
  \ playing the flute. That is true of Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. So far as I know,\
  \ it is not true of Joe Strummer of The Clash. But again, I grant that I may be\
  \ wrong, and if any readers can provide photographic evidence to the contrary I\
  \ will be happy to issue a correction.\nYou will note that Hammersmith is a conjunction\
  \ of two words, hammer and smith. A smith might use a hammer when beating, say,\
  \ a horseshoe into the required shape at his anvil. Once upon a time this was so\
  \ widely practised a trade that Smith is a common surname, Hammer less so. Instances\
  \ of the former are too numerous to mention, though we can give one-time Wimbledon\
  \ champion Stan Smith as an example. As for the latter, we might note the American\
  \ hip hoppist M C Hammer, a man who has reportedly confessed to a fear of hammers.\
  \ As with Strummer, Hammer is not known for monopodal flute-playing.\nAt last, and\
  \ not before time, we come to Palais. You will recall, in our discussion of Man,\
  \ above, that we mentioned a Frenchman. It so happens that a Frenchman says palais\
  \ where his English equivalent would say palace. Usually, a palace or palais is\
  \ the sort of building inhabited by the likes of Prince Fulgencio. Hammersmith Palais,\
  \ or Ammersmiff Palace, is, or was, not that kind of palace. Rather, it was a place\
  \ where young persons would gather en masse in a sort of mosh pit and disport themselves\
  \ in an often ungainly manner while listening to loud music or, as some might have\
  \ it, a godawful racket. There was at least one occasion when Prince Fulgencio himself\
  \ left his palace, or palais, to enter a mosh pit, where he galumphed about in the\
  \ presence of a band of troubadours led by a man standing on one leg playing a flute.\
  \ But that is a tale for another time.\nIt is to be hoped that you now have a greater\
  \ understanding of (White Man) In Hammersmith Palais by The Clash. Next week, we\
  \ shall examine I Close My Eyes And Count To Ten by Dusty Springfield. For your\
  \ preparatory homework, please read Dobson's pamphlet Arithmetic For The Blind (out\
  \ of print).\n[2016-09-18]"
