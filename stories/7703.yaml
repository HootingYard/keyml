text: "One of the pieces I read at An Evening Of Lugubrious Music & Lopsided Prose\
  \ last week was Get Carter. It seemed to be greeted with particular enthusiasm by\
  \ the audience, so much so that I have received a number of letters on the subject,\
  \ extracts from which I reproduce below:\nDear Frank, Thank you so much for your\
  \ performance last Friday. After a terribly busy week it was the perfect opportunity\
  \ to relax, and indeed as soon as you started speaking I promptly fell into a deep\
  \ and refreshing snooze. My ears pricked up, and I woke, however, when you mentioned\
  \ the dog in Get Carter. I was utterly enchanted by this pooch, and I wonder if\
  \ perhaps you have a tiny black-and-white illustration of it?\nAll Hail, Mr Key!\
  \ Last Friday I had tickets to two events, one being your \u201Cgig\u201D with Outa_Spaceman\
  \ and the other a concert by that titan of something-or-other, Tinie Tempah. As\
  \ it happened, my ticket for Mr Tempah was engulfed by a fireball, leaving me with\
  \ little choice but to trudge down to Bermondsey Square to see you. Gosh, am I glad\
  \ I did! Though virtually everything in your performance went in one ear and out\
  \ the other\u2014I speak, of course, of my own ears\u2014I marvelled at the portrait\
  \ of the dog in Get Carter. I wonder if perhaps you have a tiny black-and-white\
  \ illustration of it?\nAhoy Key! Last week I found myself trapped under a bookshelf\
  \ in Woolfson & Tay and was quite unable to extricate myself by 7.00 PM when your\
  \ performance began. I thus had to listen to the whole thing, which was a not unmixed\
  \ blessing. Full marks, however, for the bit about the dog near the end of the first\
  \ half. Though your words were vivid enough for me to see the dog clear in my mind's\
  \ eye, I wonder if perhaps you have a tiny black-and-white illustration of it?\n\
  Dear Frank, Just print a picture of the damned dog and have done with it.\n\n[2011-11-26]"
