text: "After writing dozens and dozens of books, self-help guru \u201CDr.\u201D Bruce\
  \ Terrific has had an epiphany.\n\u201CIt was always my aim to write more books\
  \ than Tony Buzan,\u201D he said in an interview with Buzantastic News magazine,\
  \ \u201CAnd having achieved that goal, I felt it was time to strike off in a new\
  \ direction. It has also dawned on me that my self-help books serve only to increase\
  \ the navel-gazing narcissism of readers who can't see further than their own petty\
  \ and squalid lives. Christ almighty, isn't it high time people stopped helping\
  \ themselves and instead helped others?\n\u201CThat's why I am launching a new series\
  \ of elf-help books. For too long, elves, fairies, and laughing gnomes have had\
  \ to fend for themselves. Well, those days are over. From now on, my readers are\
  \ going to be instructed in the best ways to devote themselves to the care and feeding\
  \ of elves. Beat that, Tony Buzan!\u201D\nThe first book in the series, Elf-Help\
  \ For Idiots, explains how to darn an elf's pointy hat when it becomes frayed.\n\
