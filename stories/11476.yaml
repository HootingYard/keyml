text: "I used to know a man whose name, unusually, was Hot Zinc. His character was\
  \ equally rum. He muttered much in Dutch, while twisting twigs into dollies. Angular\
  \ and emaciated, they were frightening dollies, quite unsuitable for the tiny tots\
  \ who form the standard dolly demographic.\nThe airbag in his car was of a wholly\
  \ new type. It was devised by his cousin. He had dozens of cousins, and the name\
  \ of the airbag designer was Ulf Drib, which is an anagram of bird flu. Ulf was\
  \ a fat fellow who looked as if several of his airbags had exploded within him.\
  \ In May 1968 he threw a pebble at a policeman in Paris. Youthful folly! Now he\
  \ was fat and comfortable and bourgeois and able to manipulate air in wondrous ways.\n\
  It was good thing he did, for Hot Zinc was a terrible driver. He ploughed into a\
  \ gaggle of swans beside a canal. The prototype new airbag saved his life. The swans\u2019\
  , not.\n[2013-05-27]"
