text: "The other day I was walking through the City of London and as I turned on to\
  \ Crutched Friars I almost collided with a friar on crutches.\n\u201COi! Watch where\
  \ you're going!\u201D he shouted.\n\u201CI do beg your pardon,\u201D I said, for\
  \ I am always polite to friars, \u201CI'm afraid I was, as so often, lost in a dreamy\
  \ haze of preoccupation.\u201D\nThe friar steadied himself on his crutches and fixed\
  \ me with a piercing gaze, as if he were preparing to excavate my soul.\n\u201C\
  With what were you preoccupied?\u201D he asked. His tone was abrupt.\n\u201COh,\
  \ nothing significant,\u201D I said, \u201CCurrent affairs, you know, turmoil at\
  \ the BBC, ash dieback, the ongoing saga of Abu Qatada.\u201D\n\u201CYou have your\
  \ finger on the pulse,\u201D he said, \u201CI know nothing of those things. As a\
  \ member of the Order of the Fratres Cruciferi my mind is pointed towards the ineffable.\u201D\
  \n\u201CAway from the grubby world?\u201D I asked, but he was already hoisting himself\
  \ off down the street. Having nothing better to do, I turned about and followed\
  \ him. There was something in that gaze that had dislodged my brain from its mundane\
  \ concerns. Not being on crutches myself, I swiftly caught up with him.\n\u201C\
  May I accompany you as you make your tottering progress along Crutched Friars?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\nHe spat on a flagstone in a very unfriarly way and grunted.\n\u201C\
  I would like to know less about current affairs and more about the ineffable,\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\u201CI can tell you nothing of the ineffable that you do not already\
  \ know, in the innermost core of your being,\u201D he said, \u201CYou might be more\
  \ interested to know why I am on crutches.\u201D\nWe turned left on to Lloyd's Avenue.\n\
  \u201CWell I didn't want to pry,\u201D I said.\nHe cackled.\n\u201CWhy do people\
  \ always say they are reluctant to pry into the affairs of crutched friars?\u201D\
  \ he said, and without waiting for an answer, carried on. \u201CThey pry when they\
  \ ought to pray. Do you pray?\u201D\n\u201CNot often,\u201D I admitted, \u201CThough\
  \ I have been known to raise my eyes to the heavens at times of emotional anguish.\u201D\
  \nWe were now on Fenchurch Street.\n\u201CI can see,\u201D he said, \u201CBy looking\
  \ at your legs that you have not suffered the emotional anguish of losing the use\
  \ of your lower limbs and being forced to haul yourself along Fenchurch Street on\
  \ crutches.\u201D\n\u201CWell actually I did lose the use of my lower limbs for\
  \ several weeks when I was seven years old,\u201D I said, \u201CAnd felt great emotional\
  \ anguish, commensurate with my youthfulness at the time.\u201D\n\u201CAh, but did\
  \ you hobble encrutched through the city?\u201D He saw from my face that the answer\
  \ was no. \u201CNo, you lay abed in the comfort of home, no doubt, fetched warm\
  \ milk and biscuits by your mama.\u201D\n\u201CIndeed so,\u201D I said, \u201CMay\
  \ I ask, then, why you do not lie abed in your friary, fetched warm milk and biscuits\
  \ by your friary equivalent of a mama?\u201D\n\u201CBecause a crutched friar cannot\
  \ rest when he has urgent business to attend!\u201D he shouted.\nWe were now on\
  \ Lombard Street.\n\u201CYou cannot pray, so pry!\u201D he went on, \u201CPry to\
  \ find out why I am on crutches and why I am heading west and now very slightly\
  \ north-west through the city!\u201D\nTo be honest, I didn't much care. I still\
  \ wanted to hear about the ineffable. But it seemed rude not to ask, as he kept\
  \ going on about his crutches, so I asked.\n\u201CWould you believe me,\u201D he\
  \ said in reply, \u201CIf I told you our friary has fallen victim to heathen voodoo\
  \ interlopers?\u201D\n\u201CI would if you furnished me with more detail,\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\u201CThey came one wild and windy night,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd they\
  \ were cleverly designed as crutched friars. They said they came from one of our\
  \ houses in Belgium or Bohemia, I forget which, somewhere beginning with B. We gave\
  \ them porridge to eat and bales of straw on which to rest. All seemed hunky dory,\
  \ or as hunky dory as it ever gets in the friary. But soon enough odd things started\
  \ to happen, odd and unseemly things. Things involving the ritual sacrifice of chickens,\
  \ for example.\u201D\n\u201CGosh!\u201D I said.\nWe passed on to Mansion House Street.\n\
  \u201CThere was an eerie shenanigans with the blood of ducks, too, and pins in dollies,\
  \ eyeless, horrible dollies. Brother Whitlow's head swelled to the size of a medicine\
  \ ball. Brother Sandwich raved like a madman. Brother Nitty turned into a serpent.\
  \ And I lost the use of my lower limbs.\u201D\n\u201CIt was voodoo?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \u201CThat is my guess. And as a crutched friar I intend to fight fire with fire.\
  \ Though I feel their heathen spell upon me. I hope it is not too late.\u201D\n\u201C\
  But surely you are safe from them, and their awful magic, here in the sun-dappled\
  \ city streets?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CHa!\u201D he cried, \u201CWould that it were\
  \ so! Their power is hideous and terrible. It is not only I who fear their damnable\
  \ tricks. You have chosen to walk beside me, so you too, at any instant, could fall\
  \ victim to their voodoo!\u201D\nAnd as he spoke, we both turned into Poultry.\n\
