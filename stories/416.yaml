text: "As I am sure all Hooting Yardists know, Deuteronomy 8.8 reads\_: \u201CA land\
  \ of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil\
  \ olive, and honey\u201D\u2014now all packed into one delicious snack bar!\n\nYou\
  \ can find some other holy confectionery here, but before stuffing your face to\
  \ the point of gluttony, do remember that elsewhere in Deuteronomy we are reminded\
  \ of \u201Cthat great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and\
  \ scorpions, and drought\u201D (ie, Pointy Town).\n[2008-04-30]"
