text: "Rex Rotograv, the avant garde rotogravurist, left instructions in his will\
  \ that he was to be buried in a rotating grave. Like William Beckford, the rich\
  \ and eccentric author of Vathek (1786), he wrote the will in a ship's cabin, on\
  \ the hat of a valet. Unlike Beckford, Rotograv did not have his own valet, so,\
  \ with the aid of his personal magnetism and the promise of a portrait in rotogravure,\
  \ he commandeered a valet from a passenger berthed in a nobbier part of the ship.\
  \ Also unlike Beckford, who died in his cabin sailing home from the West Indies,\
  \ the rotogravurist survived his voyage, as, one hoped, he might, given that in\
  \ his case the ship was a ferry plying the short distance between the Port of Tongs\
  \ and Tantarabim, crossing the Great Sopping Wet River four times daily. Upon disembarking,\
  \ Rotograv realised that he had neglected to produce the promised rotogravure for\
  \ the valet.\nHe had already experimented with a rotating grave for one of his dead\
  \ horses. Rotograv was fond of horses, and liked to go galloping along the clifftop\
  \ paths of his bailiwick seeking scenic loveliness which he would then \u201Cinterpret\u201D\
  \ in his avant garde rotogravures. His artistic skills far outstripped his capabilities\
  \ as a husbander of horses, however, and the attrition rate was dreadful. Rotograv\
  \ lost count of the dead horses he buried.\nThe idea for the rotating grave for\
  \ the horse Duvet came to him in a dream. Duvet was still alive at the time, but\
  \ died the very next day, when Rotograv was galloping along the cliffs to see the\
  \ abandoned lime kilns at Loopy Copse. Poor exhausted Duvet perished from a baffling\
  \ medical condition the like of which does not bear thinking about, and which you\
  \ would not understand in any case unless you happened to be a tiptop expert in\
  \ horse health, and even then you might scratch your head in wonderment.\nDuvet's\
  \ grave was powered by a pneumatic contraption and did a full 360\xB0\_rotation\
  \ every five minutes. Oh, it fairly spun round and round!, disturbing many a mole\
  \ and other burrowing creatures.\nFor his own grave, as described in detail with\
  \ imperishable ink on the valet's hat, Rotograv envisioned a variable speed of rotation,\
  \ now fast, now slow, depending on the atmospherics above ground. It would be a\
  \ stupendously complicated feat of subterranean engineering, but, he thought, and\
  \ hoped, he had many years ahead of him to finesse the design.\nHe did not. The\
  \ day after returning home from across the Great Sopping Wet River, an infuriated\
  \ and bare-headed valet came rushing up to him in the street, demanding the avant\
  \ garde rotogravure portrait he had been promised. A fight ensued. Rex Rotograv\
  \ was unarmed, but the valet, as valets do, carried a stiletto. And so passed from\
  \ this world a man unparalleled.\n[2014-07-23]"
