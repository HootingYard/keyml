text: "A letter arrives in Mr Key's postbag:\nSir\_: I find it promptly tricky that\
  \ during your latest musings on the life of Danny Blanchfowler, you failed to mention\
  \ Dobson's seminal pamphlet on the history and origins of the Fred Jessop Cup On\
  \ the history and origins of the Fred Jessop Cup (out of print).\nI happened upon\
  \ this pamphlet by chance in the August of 1987, whilst attending a car boot sale\
  \ in Swivenhoe, as my life then mainly consisted of scouring car boots in the vein\
  \ hope of unearthing a Penny Black. I was, anyway, passing uninterested by tens\
  \ and tens of jalopies full to their brims with tat their owners were peddling:\
  \ old lampshades, coloured rock, Ladybird books, copper barometers, worn out bicycle\
  \ tyres, Clarice Cliffe, rusty automata, dog-shaped humidors, dirty vestas and assorted\
  \ treen. One car boot though was devoid of tat, save for a box filled with yellowing\
  \ paperbacks and crumpled ordnance survey maps. Having a penchant for ordnance surveys\
  \ of the Upper Mendips, I had a rummage, and there, sandwiched in between The Viper\
  \ of Hunstanton: A Grant Panama Mystery and Ordnance Survey Map number 216: Statton-on-Fosse\
  \ to Lydford-on-Fosse, lay Dobson's out of print pamphlet.\nI snatched it from the\
  \ box with great gusto, and upon examination of its condition, promptly haggled\
  \ the slovenly oaf manning the car boot down to thruppence and a glimpse at my prized\
  \ Cuckoo's egg, for purchase of the pamphlet.\nUpon returning to my hovel, I quickly\
  \ consumed the contents of the pamphlet\u2014savouring every moment, as respite\
  \ from the squalid little life I led at the time. It is what I then unearthed, \u2018\
  neath its tattered pages, for which I am bothering to pester you.\nQuoth Dobson:\n\
  \u201Cthe Fred Jessop cup, awarded once a year to the winners of the Fred Jessop\
  \ Cup association football competition, has several peculiar mysteries surrounding\
  \ it\u2014not least, the matter of it's disappearance in 1966, the year it was won\
  \ by Crackling Northwich. The 1965/66 season had gone splendidly well for Crackling\
  \ Northwich, a team made up of workers from De Bruuin's bulb factory. This small\
  \ town club used to the monotonous pinch and shove of the Rumbelow's Division Four\
  \ (North) had, under the guidance of Keswick De Bruuin, who acted as their team\
  \ coach, chairman, janitor, physiotherapist, coach driver, notary and keeper of\
  \ the club mascot (a rather disgruntled Kittiwake called Margaret), achieved a miraculous\
  \ cup run. Keswick's team had battled their way past the Wigan Black Bull, Alsager\
  \ Fare, and Hove Young Offender's Institute in the early rounds.\nThen, after drawing\
  \ a plum tie away to Tooting Mantrap (one of the larger teams in their day), Crackling\
  \ Northwich won through into the Semi-Final of the Fred Jessop Cup. Winning eighteen\
  \ nil, with champion booter Carlo Weinnacht scoring a personal best of two. On the\
  \ day of the draw at the football association headquarters in Sloane Square, withering\
  \ old twit and head of the association, Herbert Drutt, took to the stage with an\
  \ air of discomfort and a startled look upon his chelonian features. He proceeded\
  \ to announce to the watching masses that the pride and joy of the association,\
  \ the Fred Jessop Cup, had been pilfered from its resting place in the boardroom,\
  \ betwixt the case demonstrating the various plumage phases of the mallard in eclipse\
  \ and the portrait of the Prime Minister remonstrating offside with the bosch during\
  \ the annual World War One Recreational Trench Warfare and Football picnic.\nSuspicion\
  \ fell immediately upon Keswick De Bruuin, who had previous for the theft of an\
  \ elderly Boltonian twenty years hence, and for whom the Fred Jessop Cup represented\
  \ a golden opportunity for some scrap metal smelting. Keswick, naturally in denial,\
  \ retreated to his hotel room with the entire Northwich Crackling squad, and was\
  \ not heard from again until three days later when the news broke that the cup had\
  \ been found. A part-time bomb disposal officer, Wally Sandwich, had been walking\
  \ his collie, Sniffles, around the outskirts of a disused children's recreational\
  \ area, when the dog had indicated the need to answer nature's call by giving Wally\
  \ an uncomfortable glance. Hurrying over to a swing, Wally saw metal glinting and\
  \ gleaming from underneath a climbing frame. When he went to investigate, there,\
  \ crudely wrapped in a soiled copy of Razzler, was the Fred Jessop Cup in all its\
  \ unerring glory.\nThree weeks later, Crackling Northwich were to defeat Rutland\
  \ Water three goals to two, allowing their captain, Nobby Blanchfowler to lift the\
  \ Fred Jessop Cup in front of his adoring audience and the onlooking paparazzo.\
  \ To this day, no one has ever solved the mystery of the Fred Jessop Cup snatch,\
  \ and Keswick De Bruuin never spoke of it again, meeting his untimely death at the\
  \ hands of a fraudulent psychic some two years later.\u201D\nI wonder Sir, whether\
  \ the Nobby Blanchfowler referred to therein is a relative, however distant, of\
  \ footballing prometheus Danny Blanchfowler?\nI eagerly await your reply.\nYours,\
  \ in the bath,\nColonel Philomena Crow\n\_\nWell, Colonel, I can confirm that Nobby\
  \ Blanchfowler was indeed the twin brother of Danny Blanchfowler. Indeed, so close\
  \ were the twins that they shared the same neck. Further information on this rare\
  \ medical condition can be found in the song \u201CCharlie And Charlie\u201D on\
  \ Slapp Happy's album Acnalbasac Noom. I ought to point out, however, that the Fred\
  \ Jessop Cup bears no relation whatsoever to the similarly-named Fred Jesson Cup,\
  \ as mentioned in Danny Blanchfowler\_: A Life In Football. The latter trophy, of\
  \ course, bears the name of the fantastically exciting husband of Laura Jesson,\
  \ played by Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter (1945).\n[2008-07-15]"
