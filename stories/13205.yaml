text: 'Exciting news! Tarleton is back on his balcony! He is eating a plum! It is
  a Carlsbad plum! He gazes across the city and the wasteland into the distance, where
  the pinky-russet peaks of the Pinky-Russet Mountains shimmer in the haze! From one
  of Tarleton''s ears dangles a piratical earring, but there is no piratical parrot
  on his shoulder! He has, though, acquired, since last we met him, a wooden leg!

  Tarleton''s brief, we might recall, was to gouge and hew. Gouge and hew he did,
  heroically, losing a leg in the process. But he did not complain. He showed fortitude.
  I was encamped at Fort Hoity, he said to himself, and then at Fort Toity, so it
  is only meet that, in forts, I show fortitude. No wonder Tarleton was showered with
  petunia petals by adoring peasants. There remain a few petals in his hair, for it
  is a long time since he shampooed it.

  It is a long time, too, since last he stood upon this balcony, eating a plum. It
  is so long ago that he only dimly remembers. More vivid are the memories of Fort
  Hoity, with its ostriches and bandages and zinc, and Fort Toity, with champions
  arrayed along the crenellations, and games of spit-in-the-gutter. It was between
  forts that Tarleton lost his leg to a crocodile.

  In the middle ages, returning crusaders brought with them the embalmed bodies of
  crocodiles, which were wrapped in chains and hung from the ceilings of cathedrals.
  Tarleton did not think of his gouging and hewing as a crusade, but it was, oh it
  was.

  He spits out the plumstone into the palm of his hand, makes a fist, and, taking
  careful aim, tosses it over the edge of the balcony down into the shallow pool around
  the fountain. How many Carlsbad plumstones lie there, barely submerged! He has never
  once missed a toss. Tarleton turns and withdraws into his chamber. His head is full
  of squeaking imaginary bats.
