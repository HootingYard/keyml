text: "Dear Mr. Key, writes Mick Wiggins from across the pond, Just like a recent\
  \ listener's account of the Hooting Yard narrative voice taking over the helm whilst\
  \ sightseeing, I similarly experienced the same while visiting the Maritime Museum\
  \ in Astoria, Oregon, just this last weekend. \_The museum, located at the mouth\
  \ of the once mighty Columbia River, open to Cape Disappointment and just down the\
  \ way from Dismal Nitch, was a very good museum, with many arcane and wonderous\
  \ accounts of the famous \u201CGraveyard of the Pacific\u201D. \_Of course it was\
  \ when I found myself studying a fantastic display of pudding fenders that the Hooting\
  \ Yard Effect commandeered my own internal voice, and it really was a value-added\
  \ treat. It is too bad you cannot capitalize on this effect, but perhaps you should\
  \ look in to it. At any rate, thank you for the many hours of listening pleasure.\n\
  I have replied to Mr Wiggins asking him to tell us more about pudding fenders, so\
  \ watch this space.\n[2008-10-10]"
