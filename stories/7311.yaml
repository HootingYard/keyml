text: "In The Invention Of Murder\_: How The Victorians Revelled In Death And Detection\
  \ And Created Modern Crime (2011), Judith Flanders makes a passing reference which,\
  \ though brief, has me eager to read the novel in question:\nIn 1860, in The Trail\
  \ Of The Serpent, Mrs Braddon had advanced her plot through Sloshy, the adopted\
  \ child of a mute policeman\nCome to think of it, I may not bother to read the book\
  \ itself, but simply adopt the characters for my own use. Sloshy! The mute policeman!\
  \ They shall live again at Hooting Yard!\n[2011-09-18]"
