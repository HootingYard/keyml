text: "[W. B. Yeats\u2019 reluctance to have his poetry set to music] was born of\
  \ his horror at being invited by a certain composer to hear a setting of his Lake\
  \ Isle Of Innisfree\u2014a poem which voices a solitary man's desire for still greater\
  \ solitude\u2014sung by a choir of a thousand Boy Scouts.\nPeter Warlock, \u2018\
  Mr Yeats And A Musical Censorship\u2019, Musical Times, February 1922\nWhen Berlioz\
  \ was found wandering about the mountains, note-book in hand, sketching his Overture\
  \ to King Lear, he was arrested as a spy, and his protests that he was not making\
  \ notes in a secret cipher were received with ridicule by the police. \u201CIt is\
  \ well known\u201D, they said, \u201Cthat music cannot be composed without a pianoforte.\u201D\
  \ Berlioz we know could not play the pianoforte. But his case provides no rule and\
  \ the fact remains that a great deal of music, especially at the present time, is\
  \ either extemporized at the keyboard or else built up of fragments discovered,\
  \ more or less fortuitously at the pianoforte and afterwards unskillfully glued\
  \ together.\nPeter Warlock, \u2018A Note On The Mind's Ear\u2019, Musical Times,\
  \ February 1922\nBoth quotations appear in Peter Warlock\_: The Life Of Philip Heseltine\
  \ by Barry Smith (1994)\n[2013-04-21]"
