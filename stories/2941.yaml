text: "\u201CThe reviewer gets carried away with his own sensational tale of \u2018\
  Medea Blenkinsop, or the Octogamist\u2019:\n\u2018But think of the shifts and perplexities\
  \ of a wife with eight husbands, being not only mysteriously married like Aurora\
  \ Floyd to her noble husband's horse-trainer, but\u2026 also to the Emperor of China,\
  \ who writes compromising letters by each mail, the more compromising as she is\
  \ also secretly married to the postman, who is of a suspicious temper\u2026; also,\
  \ under peculiar circumstances, to the giant of a show that is coming to be set\
  \ up at a fair in the neighbourhood; also to a maniac whom she keeps in the cellar.'\u201D\
