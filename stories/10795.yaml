text: "Woke up in my hovel. Ate a mess of pottage for breakfast. It was a bracing\
  \ day in Cisalpine Gaul, so I thought I would take a trudge down to the river to\
  \ wake my weary bones and slop out the pot. It is not the best of rivers for slopping\
  \ out, for the water is muddy and red, but at least it is shallow, so there is no\
  \ danger of drowning.\nSo there I was slopping out my pot in the river when, from\
  \ behind me, back in Cisalpine Gaul, came the thumping and clomping of a Roman legion.\
  \ \u201CLegio XIII Gemina\u201D it said on their banners, which I had read in the\
  \ papyri was under the command of Julius Caesar. And indeed it was he, leading his\
  \ legion, who now bore down upon me, a frightful look on his face.\n\u201CHail,\
  \ rude peasant!\u201D he cried, \u201CWhat river is this?\u201D\nI tugged my forelock\
  \ and sprawled in the muck, and told him it was the Rubicon.\n\u201CSo over on the\
  \ other side is Italy?\u201D\n\u201CThat's right, O mighty Caesar!\u201D I replied,\
  \ cowering.\nEven though I am a mere peasant I am quite learned. I regularly read\
  \ the papyri and have a grasp of current affairs and the laws governing the Roman\
  \ Empire. I thought it best to tell Julius Caesar what I knew, so I pointed out\
  \ that if he entered Italy at the head of his legion and tried to exercise imperium,\
  \ the inevitable punishment was death, not only for him but for all the chaps in\
  \ the legion.\nThis gave him pause, and for a while he seemed unsure what to do.\
  \ While he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred. A person remarkable\
  \ for his noble mien and graceful aspect, appeared close at hand, sitting and playing\
  \ upon a pipe. When, not only the shepherds, but a number of soldiers also flocked\
  \ from their posts to listen to him, and some trumpeters among them, he snatched\
  \ a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it, and sounding the advance\
  \ with a piercing blast, crossed to the other side. Upon this, Caesar exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CLet us go whither the omens of the Gods and the iniquity of our enemies\
  \ call us. The die is now cast.\u201D\nI watched as he led his legion across the\
  \ shallow muddy red Rubicon into Italy, then took my slopped out pot and trudged\
  \ back to my hovel. Nothing much else happened in Cisalpine Gaul for the rest of\
  \ the day, though I suppose it is worth noting that I spotted a flock of birds swooping\
  \ across the sky at dusk. Alas, my knowledge of ornithology is sparse, so I cannot\
  \ say what kind of birds they were. Linnets? Starlings?\n[2013-01-10]"
