text: "Shortly after completing his twelfth symphony, Binder decided to take himself\
  \ a wife. He had been distressed at the critical reception given to his latest work,\
  \ which was considered to be extremely sordid. Binder felt that perhaps some feminine\
  \ influence might temper his moral grubbiness. But he knew no women, at least, no\
  \ women who would consent to wed him in a million years. Though he was a successful\
  \ composer, he lacked a certain vital human pith. This, at least, was the judgement\
  \ of his confidante, the dwarf Crepusco, who told Binder that he seemed more like\
  \ a cardboard cut-out or a man of cellophane, rather than a person of flesh and\
  \ blood. Poor Binder!, we might think, yet there was truth in the charge. Ever since\
  \ his days at the Academy For Tiny Musical Magnificos, he had lived in a sort of\
  \ rarefied ear-world. If he were to bag a wife, that would have to change.\nThe\
  \ composer was living at the time in a godforsaken estuarine village surrounded\
  \ by marshes and mud flats. So one foul misty Thursday evening he hied himself down\
  \ to the tavern, where he thought he might meet a bride. But upon clumping through\
  \ the door, he found only men, coastal peasantry and invalid sailors for the most\
  \ part. He fell in with a couple of sharkers and swaggerers who caroused and quaffed\
  \ in large silver cans to his health. Fellows they were that had good big pop mouths\
  \ to cry Port a helm Saint George, and knew as well as the best what belongs to\
  \ haling of boilings yare. By chance, this pair, whose names were Vermig and Beamish,\
  \ were themselves both due to be married. Binder, sipping from his mug of brewer's\
  \ fudgemuck, congratulated his new pals, and asked if perchance their brides-to-be\
  \ had a friend to whom he might be introduced. He had already, before leaving for\
  \ the tavern, taken some tips from Crepusco regarding vivacity, dash, and \xE9lan,\
  \ and was eager to practise his skills. To his surprise, Vermig and Beamish fell\
  \ about in hysterical fits, spitting and sloshing and slapping their sides. Binder\
  \ blushed. Eventually his companions becalmed themselves, and Vermig spoke.\n\u201C\
  We know not yet who our brides will be,\u201D he said, \u201CTomorrow, we are heading\
  \ up into the great purple hills yonder, where we will find ourselves a pair of\
  \ fogwives. Come with us, dear chap, and there will be a fogwife for you too!\u201D\
  \nBinder had no idea what Vermig was talking about, but he reasoned that a fogwife\
  \ was better than no wife at all. He arranged to meet the ruined sailors next morning\
  \ at the crossroads, all togged up and kitted out for a-roaming in the purple hills.\n\
  And up in those hills, the next day, in mid-afternoon, Binder and Vermig and Beamish\
  \ chanced upon a trio of hill-women tending their pigs on a vertiginous slope. Both\
  \ the women and the pigs were lopsided, for they spent all their lives on steep\
  \ gradients. The would-be bridegrooms learned that their would-be inamoratas were\
  \ known as the Ellipses, for there were three of them and they were each named Dot.\
  \ Vermig did most of the talking.\n\u201COh cherishable if lopsided girlies,\u201D\
  \ he declared, after they had broken the ice by talking pig lore, \u201CCome with\
  \ us down from the hills to our misty marshy estuary paradiso, where thick fog will\
  \ swaddle you, and be our wives. You may bring your hill-pigs, for though we cannot\
  \ promise them the sloping land they are used to, we have much mud and muck and\
  \ it oozes with briny goodness.\u201D\nDot and Dot and Dot repaired to a crevice\
  \ in the hillside, where they discussed this proposal, and found it good.\nThe very\
  \ next day, in the foul air of the village, the three couples were married in the\
  \ dilapidated church, and bells would have rung out had sound been able to travel\
  \ through the enshrouding mist, the mist from the marshes that smothered and muffled\
  \ and swirled sluggishly around, through night and day, until it penetrated the\
  \ limbs and the lungs and brought Dot and Dot and Dot, so unused to it, surely to\
  \ their sickbeds within a twelvemonth.\nDot Vermig and Dot Beamish were true fogwives,\
  \ and before another year was out both lay entombed in the fogbound churchyard,\
  \ and their widowers sat in the tavern gathering their wits for another foray into\
  \ the hills. But Dot Binder, though she suffered much, from agues and gnawing of\
  \ the vitals, was nursed back to vigour by the wondrous passing manoeuvres of the\
  \ dwarf Crepusco, and she lived happily with Binder for many decades, and took two\
  \ of her lopsided pigs to the premiere of his forty-ninth and final symphony, and\
  \ she survived him, and set up home with Crepusco, far from the estuary, in a mountain\
  \ chalet, with a balcony for tubercular guests, and an eyrie adapted for the pigs,\
  \ and mezzotints of her long departed friends Dot and Dot framed upon her mantel.\n\
