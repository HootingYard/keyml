text: "I make no apology for the fact that I have become a rabid surrealophobe. We\
  \ need to be careful with our terminology, however. Time was when a phobia meant\
  \ an irrational fear\u2014as in triskaidekaphobia, fear of the number 13. Nowadays,\
  \ in our debased world, the -phobia suffix has come to denote little more than hatred,\
  \ irrational because it is not shared by right-on Guardian reading types. Thus homophobia\
  \ and Islamophobia, for instance. This is not the place to take a forensic fork\
  \ to the weird interior world of Guardian readers, who are generally tolerant of\
  \ absolutely everything except everything with which they disagree, which is verboten,\
  \ forever and ever.\nIt must be understood, then, that I have neither an irrational\
  \ fear nor hatred of surrealists. Quite the contrary. What I hate, with a loathing\
  \ that seems to me entirely reasonable, is the bandying about of the word \u201C\
  surreal\u201D to refer to the mildly out of the ordinary, or at times even the wholly\
  \ ordinary.\n\u201COh wow it was surreal\u201D, a halfwit will announce, panting\
  \ with stupidity, at something or other. I have heard such exclamations yelped at\
  \ sight of, for example, a minor traffic accident, a malfunctioning self-service\
  \ till in a supermarket, and a cat behaving like a cat. There is not a jot of surrealism\
  \ in any of these things. Anybody who thinks\u2014let alone jabbers aloud\u2014\
  that there is needs the innards of their head sluiced out with a powerful antistupidity\
  \ solvent.\nIt may be time to begin a campaign to Bring Back Real Surrealism, with\
  \ badges and banners and marches and petitions and chance encounters of sewing machines\
  \ and umbrellas on operating tables.\nNOTA BENE\_: Mr Key is not a surrealist. His\
  \ work is not surrealism.\n\nReal Surrealism\_:\nLeonora Carrington, The Temptation\
  \ Of Saint Anthony (1947)\n[2014-02-01]"
