text: "Our survey of artworks continues with Plenipotentiary With Cornflakes Carton\
  \ And Nightjar. This is a large painting, though I have not measured it, showing,\
  \ as its title indicates, a plenipotentiary with the traditional attributes of his\
  \ office, a cornflakes carton and a nightjar. Executed in scumbled daubs of emulsion\
  \ on a sheet of corrugated cardboard, the plenipotentiary is shown leaning insouciantly\
  \ against a mantelpiece, holding in his right hand a cornflakes carton while a nightjar\
  \ perches atop his head. Stipples of what looks like gouache have been stippled\
  \ hither and thither about the composition to add \xE9lan. There is an unseemly\
  \ smudge at the bottom left, above which the painter's signature has been scribbled\
  \ with a biro, seemingly so hurriedly that it is illegible. The overall style is\
  \ a combination of primitivist, classical, Rococo, expressionist, winsome, cack-handed,\
  \ and gorgeous.\nThis is probably the most important painting in the collection\
  \ of the toffee apple entrepreneur Argvis Bonescrape, who refuses all permission\
  \ to reproduce it in any form.\nYou may also enjoy\_: Biro Scribble With Unseemly\
  \ Smudge, Nightjar With Plenipotentiary And Gouache Stipples, and Cornflakes Carton\
  \ No. 17. The latter is a conceptual artwork and does not actually consist of a\
  \ cornflakes carton in any form whatsoever, other than as an idea nestling in the\
  \ artist's brain. We have no current information regarding cornflakes cartons numbers\
  \ one to sixteen, which may not even exist.\nIf you would like further information\
  \ on nightjars, please consult an authoritative reference work on ornithology.\n\
