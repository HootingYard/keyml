text: 'In a German forest, sunk in gloom

  Surrounded by men who spell my doom

  All these Fritzes, Horsts and Kurts

  Explain the depth of my Weltschmerz

  But then they all fall to their knees

  Attacked by German killer bees

  And now my spirits are surely buoyed

  As I am filled with Schadenfreude
