text: "A couple of days ago, we looked at angles of hats, and today we turn our attention\
  \ to angels of huts. One of the least rewarding periods of Blodgett's life was when\
  \ he had a job managing a collection of huts, each of which had its resident angel.\
  \ These were battered and dilapidated rustic huts, rather than more well-appointed\
  \ beach huts, or chalets, the type of hut Blodgett understood them to be when he\
  \ accepted the post. Imagine his distress when the train taking him to his new office\
  \ delivered him not to a sandy stretch of coastline but to a filthy countryside\
  \ backwater ankle-deep in muck.\_ This was particularly galling because at the time\
  \ he was being followed about by a film crew working on a documentary called Blodgett\
  \ On The Beach. The film had been commissioned by an ambitious but airheaded young\
  \ git from Channel Bilge, and once it became clear that Blodgett was not going anywhere\
  \ near the seaside, the airhead cancelled the project and sent his crew to cover\
  \ a dramatic reconstruction of the credit crunch instead.\nSo it was a solitary\
  \ Blodgett who was deposited from the train at a deserted railway station in the\
  \ middle of nowhere. He fumbled in his pocket for the hand-scrawled map his masters\
  \ had given him and set off on his squelchy way to a distant barn, in a corner of\
  \ which a desk with an anglepoise lamp and a pencil sharpener and a vase of spurge\
  \ had been provided as his operational base. Just as the United Nations has its\
  \ special rapporteurs, and Olympic teams have their chefs de mission, Blodgett's\
  \ job title was French and sounded important, and he was, at least at this point\
  \ in his life, na\u0209ve enough to swell with pride as, approaching the barn, he\
  \ paused to pin his badge on his lapel. To their credit, his employers had no truck\
  \ with such execrations as the contemporary laminated name-badge, and Blodgett's\
  \ badge was brass and heraldic and lively with beaked and taloned and winged beasts\
  \ of myth and with Latin inscriptions. Blodgett had neither French nor Latin, so\
  \ he had no idea of the meaning of either his job title or of the motto upon his\
  \ badge. What he did have were unparalleled map-reading skills, and he was soon\
  \ installed at his desk in the corner of the barn, having improvised a crate as\
  \ a chair, and plugged the anglepoise lamp into a generator.\nThe many huts for\
  \ which Blodgett had responsibility were scattered all over the place, in no discernible\
  \ pattern. This rapidly became apparent to him when he stuck pins into a map tacked\
  \ up on the barn wall, each pin representing one of the huts. Blodgett did this,\
  \ with much enthusiasm, as preparation for what he foresaw as regular rounds of\
  \ visits to his huts and to their resident angels. So great was the distance he\
  \ would have to travel that he wondered if he could afford to rent a horse or a\
  \ jalopy. He was counting out his coinage on the desk, just hours after his arrival,\
  \ when he was interrupted by a visitor, who brought news that blasted Blodgett's\
  \ plans and left him sobbing.\n\u201CHow now?\u201D shouted the newcomer as he burst\
  \ into the barn, \u201CYou must be Blodgett! I am Simon Sebag Costanza and this\
  \ is my theme tune!\u201D He pulled a portable parpophone from his pocket, depressed\
  \ a knob, and a short burst of Hindemith's Concert Music For String And Brass Instruments,\
  \ Op. 50 (1930) roared at deafening volume and made the barn shake. It also made\
  \ Blodgett shake, so much so that he lost his footing and toppled to the floor,\
  \ where he remained hidden from his visitor's view as Costanza continued, having\
  \ redepressed the knob and popped the parpophone back into his pocket. \u201CThere\
  \ is much you will need to know as the new manager of the many scattered huts with\
  \ their resident angels, and I am here to tell you what's what, even though you\
  \ are crumpled on the floor behind your desk. It is all the same to me if you stay\
  \ there throughout your tenure, so long as you keep up with your paperwork. I will\
  \ be out and about on my visits to the huts, for I am the Milk Man. No, no, not\
  \ the sort of milkman you may think, pootling around the lanes in an electric float\
  \ delivering bottles of milk, as happened in days of yore. A pox on such ninnies!\
  \ No, I am the Milk Man who calls upon the angels of the huts and monitors their\
  \ intake of angel milk! There are recording angels and fumigating angels, there\
  \ are angels of mercy, moon angels and archangels, but what all angels have in common\
  \ is that they are reliant upon angel milk for their sprightliness and spark. Thus\
  \ it falls to me to keep a proper check on the angels of our huts, lest they fall\
  \ prey to ennui and Weltschmerz through neglecting their milk diet. Your job, meanwhile,\
  \ is to sit at your desk, or crumpled on the floor behind it, and, by the light\
  \ of the anglepoise lamp, to enter my daily dictated reports into a ledger. We measure\
  \ milk by the pint here, Blodgett, so you will need no knowledge of fractions. But\
  \ you must tally up the daily pintage and do much other tiresome and exhausting\
  \ drudgery, and never once set foot outside the barn, not even to contemplate the\
  \ cows in the fields or to chuck breadcrumbs on to the duckpond, for at any time\
  \ of day or night I, the Milk Man, may come a-calling with my reports, and you must\
  \ be at your post, diligent and miserable, for such is the way we do things in these\
  \ parts and if ever you forget that you will be at the mercy of the cacodaemons,\
  \ Blodgett, the cacodaemons with their curdled milk and their unspeakable yoghurts.\u201D\
  \nWith a second blast of his theme tune from the parpophone, Simon Sebag Costanza,\
  \ the Milk Man, swept out of the barn. From behind the desk came the sound of sobbing,\
  \ as Blodgett realised the full horror of his situation. He was stuck there for\
  \ years, for years and years, at a desk in the corner of the barn, in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, when all he had ever wanted was to stride purposefully from hut to\
  \ hut, huts he was in charge of, preferably at the seaside.\n[2008-09-20]"
