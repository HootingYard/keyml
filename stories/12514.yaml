text: "In his latest Dabbler Diary, Brit gives an account of a thrilling event he\
  \ attended last week:\nTo Bristol Grammar School, to hear Frank Key address a Sixth\
  \ Form Literary Society! You didn't expect that either, did you? It was arranged\
  \ by the inestimable Roland Clare, editor of \_By Aerostat to Hooting Yard, who\
  \ introduced Frank with a comprehensive, lavishly illustrated and frequently hilarious\
  \ lecture on nonsense. I have to say, though, that for all the amusement afforded\
  \ by the surrealists, the dada-ists, John Lennon, the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah band and\
  \ others, none of the nonsensarians are nearly so funny as Frank Key reading his\
  \ own material. The only ones who come close are Ivor Cutler and the Bible.\nFrank\
  \ warmed up his unsuspecting young audience with Little Dagobert and the Binder\
  \ Symphonies, at which there was much baffled tittering, then battered them mercilessly\
  \ into submission with How to Think of Things Other Than Juggling, which contains\
  \ the longest sentence he has ever written. It's quite a thing, listening to a really,\
  \ really long sentence being read aloud. One goes through a full range of emotions,\
  \ from hilarity to despair and back again. It's a journey. I could see some of the\
  \ sixth formers seriously struggling at the midway point. \u201CAt least it's not\
  \ Neil Kinnock,\u201D I wanted to say to them. But, as all things must, the sentence\
  \ did at last pass, and Frank took pity on his audience and finished with a corker.\n\
  Afterwards I mingled with some of the pupils and assorted guests, including some\
  \ of Bristol's most thrusting young eccentrics and, quite unexpectedly, the well-known\
  \ philosopher Julian Baggini. A youthful poet with a curly black moptop analysed\
  \ Frank's long sentence with admirable seriousness, praising its hypnotic effect.\
  \ When all had dispersed, Roland and Frank and I stood around and surveyed the buffet\
  \ leftovers. How deeply moving it was to watch the penniless authors methodically\
  \ consume the free sandwiches.\nI cannot speak for Roland, but as far as I recall\
  \ I ate only a single sandwich.\n[2014-03-18]"
