text: "Here is a last extract (at least, for the time being) from Philomen Holland's\
  \ translation of Pliny's Natural History, from The Seven And Thirtieth Booke, Chaps.\
  \ 2, 3, Of Amber:\n\u201CBut I wonder most at Sophocles the Tragicall Poet\u2026\
  \ that he should go beyond al others in fabulous reports, as touching Amber: for\
  \ he sticketh not to avouch, That beyond India it proceedeth from the tears that\
  \ fall from the eies of the birds Meleagrides, wailing and weeping for the death\
  \ of Meleager. Who would not marvell, that either himselfe should be of that beliefe,\
  \ or hope to persuade others to his opinion? For what child is there to be found\
  \ so simple and ignorant, who will beleeve, that birds should keep their times to\
  \ shed tears\_ every yere so duly, and especially so great drops and in such quantitie,\
  \ sufficient to engender Amber in that abundance? Besides, what congruitie is there,\
  \ that birds should depart as far as to the Indians and beyond, for to mourn and\
  \ lament the death of Meleager when he died in Greece?\n\u201CWhat should a man\
  \ say to this? Are there not many more as goodly tales as these, which Poets have\
  \ sent abroad into the world? And their profession of Poetry, that is to say, of\
  \ faining and devising fables, may in some sort excuse them. But that any man should\
  \ seriously and by way of history deliver such stuffe, as touching a thing so rife\
  \ and common, brought in every day in abundance by merchants which were ynough to\
  \ convince such impudent lies, is a meere mockerie of the world in the highest degree;\
  \ a contempt offered to all men, and argueth an habit of lying, and an impunitie\
  \ of that vice intollerable.\u201D\n[2010-08-08]"
