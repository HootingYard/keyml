  \ my very own hovel I found, amongst a lot of bird poop, dead crows and other muck,\
  \ a small package tied up with rusty wire.\_ On opening\_ the package all it contained\
  \ was\_a small card-mounted photo of a style which I think is called carte de visite.\_\
  \ On the back of the photo in green ink was written the following: \u201CDobson,\
  \ shortly befor he died\u201D [sic].\_ Do you think this could be your very own\
  \ pamphleteer?\_ I attach a copy of the photo.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\
