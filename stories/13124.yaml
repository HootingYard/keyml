text: "A letter plops onto the mat from a correspondent who wishes to remain anonymous.\
  \ \u201CI work for an important national institution,\u201D he writes, \u201Cand\
  \ if the powers that be ever discover I am a fanatically devoted Hooting Yard reader,\
  \ my career will go up in smoke.\u201D I would have thought it would guarantee instant\
  \ promotion to the very top of the tree, plus gongs and baubles, but I may have\
  \ an imperfect grasp of these matters. Anyway, the letter from this shadowy figure\
  \ is headed\u2014rather worryingly\u2014\u201CPlagiarism\u201D. Here is what he\
  \ has to say:\nMr Key! I thought I should bring this rather important matter to\
  \ your attention. Your secret is out.\nWhile away on an extended family holiday\
  \ recently. I read the 1986 novel It by Stephen King. I like to submerge myself\
  \ in fantasy/horror guff while I am disconnected from my mainstream way of life.\
  \ Anyway, I read a 1100 page Stephen King novel\u2014why am I defending myself?\
  \ That is not why I am here.\nIf I may interject for a moment, I too am puzzled\
  \ why my correspondent feels the need to defend himself. I have read a few Stephen\
  \ King books over the years. He is a superb storyteller, and I have nought but admiration\
  \ for his industry and craft.\nSo, during the book, a young boy, who is keen on\
  \ birdwatching, is affoisted (I think I may have made that word up) by the evil\
  \ clown/spirit thing in a water tower. In order to defend himself, he must really\
  \ \u2018believe in himself\u2019 or some such of the like that allows the story\
  \ to move on in a semi-logical way.\n\u201CHow does he do this?\u201D you ask. I\
  \ shall tell you:\n1. He holds up his birdwatching book \u2018like a shield\u2019\
  \ (does not specify whether book is opened or closed)\n2. He chants\u2014and this\
  \ is the point, Mr Key, so pay attention\u2014\u201CRobins! Gray egrets! Loons!\
  \ Scarlet tanagers! Grackles! Hammerhead woodpeckers! Redheaded woodpeckers! Chickadees!\
  \ Wrens!\u201D\nThere! Did you see that? In the middle of a book which has sold\
  \ millions! A list of birds! \u201CRobins! Gray egrets! Loons! Scarlet tanagers!\
  \ Grackles! Hammerhead woodpeckers! Redheaded woodpeckers! Chickadees! Wrens!\u201D\
  \nSo: tell me the truth. Is it plagiarism, or are you and Stephen King in actuality\
  \ the same person? Or; hah!, no doubt you have some other high and mighty explanation!?\n\
  I note that the book my correspondent quotes from was published in 1986, the same\
  \ year as the inaugural Malice Aforethought Press pamphlet which unleashed Mr Key's\
  \ prose into a panting and expectant world. Clearly, then, Mr King was employing\
  \ some kind of eldritch mind transference powers to \u201Ctap into\u201D the Key\
  \ cranium, rifling through it not only for its present contents but for material\
  \ it would contain in the future. So let us say, rather, some kind of eldritch time-travel\
  \ mind transference powers\u2014precisely the kind of gubbins we find in Mr King's\
  \ books. I rest my case, though I would add that I have a distinct memory of taking\
  \ a snooze in the year 1986 during which I had that uncanny feeling one sometimes\
  \ gets that my brain was being rummaged through, past, present, and future, by a\
  \ freakishly tall recovering alcoholic American bestselling writer.\n[2014-08-28]"
