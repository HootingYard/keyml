  \ For now, in light of the passing of Leonard Cohen, here is a piece I wrote for\
  \ The Dabbler five years ago.\nCohen tells us, in his song Suzanne, that \u201C\
  there are heroes in the seaweed\u201D. Oh really?, I asked myself, not without a\
  \ dash of skepticism, And what precisely would heroes be doing, disporting themselves\
  \ in the sargassum and the kelp? Still, one does not wish to dismiss out of hand\
  \ the words of a figure of such stature, so I summoned my sidekick and went to investigate.\n\
  Out by the aerodrome, we boarded a charabanc heading for the seashore, but not before\
  \ arming ourselves each with a long and pointy stick. These, I explained to my somewhat\
  \ dim sidekick, we would use to poke about the seaweed in search of heroes. He seemed\
  \ satisfied with this intelligence, but as the charabanc gathered speed crossing\
  \ the wild and windy moors, he babbled questions at me.\nWhich particular heroes\
  \ were they, that were to be found in the seaweed? Heroes of Ancient Greece, such\
  \ as Heracles and Theseus and Jason and Bellerophon? Tragic heroes such as Orestes\
  \ and Oedipus and Hamlet? Byronic heroes? Guitar heroes? Boys\u2019 Own Paper heroes?\
  \ Or modern-day superheroes such as Batman and Spiderman and Unconscious Squirrel!,\
  \ The Unconscious Squirrel? Or would we find, entangled in the seaweed, representatives\
  \ of all these types of hero, and more? And were they trapped in the seaweed, struggling\
  \ heroically to escape from it, or had they made it their natural habitat, nesting\
  \ in it, as it were, even perhaps feeding off it?\nI was fairly sure Cohen had not\
  \ addressed these questions in his song, but to be on the safe side I decided to\
  \ listen to it again. Pointing out of the charabanc window at a flock of starlings\
  \ to distract my sidekick's attention and shut him up, I jammed into my ears the\
  \ tiny headphones of my iLeonard and pressed \u201Cplay\u201D. Precisely three minutes\
  \ and forty-nine seconds later, I removed the headphones and turned to my sidekick,\
  \ who was still staring out of the window, mouth open, dribbling, though the starlings\
  \ had long vanished, and the only bird visible in the sky was a lone lark, or it\
  \ might have been a swift or even an avocet. I know nothing of ornithology.\n\u201C\
  Cohen does not expand upon his assertion,\u201D I said, \u201CSo we shall have to\
  \ poke about with our long pointy sticks and see what we shall see. First, though,\
  \ I think we are both in need of refreshments, so we shall stop at the seaside kiosk\
  \ for some tea and oranges that come all the way from China.\u201D\nMy sidekick\
  \ was happy with this suggestion, and he grinned. It is never a pretty sight, so\
  \ I closed my eyes. Earlier that day I had climbed a whole mountainside to wash\
  \ my eyelids in the rain, which had puffed me out something awful, and no sooner\
  \ were my eyes shut than I fell into a snooze.\nWhen I woke the charabanc was parked\
  \ in a lay-by at the seashore. I was the only passenger still aboard. Even my sidekick\
  \ had gone. I disembarked and made my way to the kiosk, where I was sure I would\
  \ find him stuffing his gob with Chinese oranges. The kiosk was bolted and shuttered,\
  \ but by following a trail of spilt tea and strips of Chinese orange peel I soon\
  \ tracked down my sidekick. He was squelching about in a tide pool, poking his long\
  \ pointy stick into it.\n\u201CHave you speared any heroes?\u201D I called.\n\u201C\
  Nope,\u201D he replied, \u201CJust sculpins and killifish and blennies and yellow\
  \ spongefish and sea stars and sea cucumbers and sea urchins and sand shrimps and\
  \ lobsters and crabs and hermit crabs and green-lined shore crabs and barnacles\
  \ and nudibranchs and chitons and mussels and scallops and abalones and limpets\
  \ and snails. Oh, and a sea anemone.\u201D\n\u201CNo sign at all of Orde Wingate\
  \ or Captain James T Kirk, to pluck but two heroes at random?\u201D\n\u201CNope.\u201D\
  \nI went to sit on a slimy boulder. It occurred to me that heroes might be more\
  \ likely to swim about in the open sea, festooned with seaweed like mermaids. We\
  \ would have to hire a rowing-boat to extend our quest. It also occurred to me that\
  \ it would be cheaper, and far less tiresome, to conclude that Cohen had no idea\
  \ what he was talking about.\n\u201CCome, sidekick,\u201D I called, \u201CThrow\
  \ away your long pointy stick and let us catch the charabanc home before darkness\
  \ falls.\u201D\nAnd so we did, but we never made it home. For long before we reached\
  \ the bus stop by the aerodrome, the charabanc driver killed the lights in a lonely\
  \ lane and an ape with angel glands erased the final wisps of pain with the music\
  \ of rubber bands.\n[2016-11-11]"
