text: "I keep a list of every book I have read, which now goes back thirty years.\
  \ (In January 1982, the first book I read was The Annotated Snark by Martin Gardner.)\
  \ Almost always, I have a book on the go. As soon as I finish one, I begin reading\
  \ another. There was a time when I was able to have several titles in my \u201C\
  current reading\u201D, switching between them as I saw fit, but for the past couple\
  \ of decades I have been a one-book-at-a-time reader. There is rarely any pattern\
  \ or method to my reading. I flit from one thing to another, often jarringly. (The\
  \ three most recent titles in my list are Little Boy Lost by Marghanita Laski, Race\
  \ And Culture\_: A World View by Thomas Sowell, and\u2014almost finished, about\
  \ to be added\u2014A Cup Of News\_: The Life Of Thomas Nashe by Charles Nicholl.)\
  \ Occasionally I immerse myself in the work of a single author for book after book\
  \ after book. I note from my list, for example, that in 1991 I went on a protracted\
  \ Franz Kafka jag, and that the spring of 1993 was devoted exclusively to Vladimir\
  \ Nabokov. It is not just writers of fiction who can keep me in thrall. I suspect\
  \ I am about to plough my way through several other books by Charles Nicholl in\
  \ the coming weeks, on Christopher Marlowe and Sir Walter Ralegh and Rimbaud. (The\
  \ ability to lay my hands on all this stuff is entirely due to the paradise that\
  \ is the London Library, which has had a seismic effect on which books I choose\
  \ to read. I still cannot fathom why I spent so long living in London without being\
  \ a member.)\nCursed, or blessed, with a memory so godawful that it approaches the\
  \ eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, I can forget a book within days, even hours,\
  \ of reading it. One reason to maintain my list is simply to be able to recall what\
  \ I have read in the past. Such forgetting makes rereading a pleasure, of course.\
  \ It is no judgement on the worth, or otherwise, of a particular book that I remember\
  \ little or nothing about it. Intriguingly, sometimes I can remember vividly the\
  \ circumstances in which I read a book without recalling the content of the book\
  \ itself. Again, scanning my list, I can quite clearly picture myself sitting beside\
  \ a lake, on a summer's evening in 1995, reading The Tax Inspector by Peter Carey.\
  \ Other titles summon up less specific memories, but are resonant of times and places\
  \ in the past.\nMy list, as I said, begins in 1982. For some years before that,\
  \ beginning I think in 1975, there was a list now lost. It is those early years\
  \ of my reading that I want to attend to. Without the aide memoire of a list, what\
  \ I recollect is fragmentary. What interests me are the books I chose to read, in\
  \ those early years of \u201Cadult\u201D reading, and which ones I can remember.\n\
  One that I remember clearly is one I never actually read. I grew up in a house full\
  \ of books. My parents\u2019 collection, much of which I have today, was a mixture\
  \ of classics and general fiction and poetry and blue-spined Pelicans and history\
  \ and art and film books, a heteroclite jumble. One of my older sisters had a small\
  \ collection of, mostly, Penguin paperbacks suitable for a budding intellectual\
  \ of a certain stripe\u2014Nietzsche, R D Laing, D H Lawrence, Thomas Hardy and\
  \ Iris Murdoch. Why do I recall so clearly her copy of Murdoch's A Severed Head,\
  \ which I took from her shelf and leafed through, repeatedly, without ever actually\
  \ sitting down and reading the damned thing? Reflecting on it now, I think the young\
  \ teenage me identified something amusingly portentous in that title. Gosh, this\
  \ must be a serious and significant work, I thought to myself, laughing at its preposterousness.\
  \ It still seems preposterous. I have still never read it.\nWas it the contents\
  \ of those four small shelves in my sister's room, rather than the more extensive\
  \ collection downstairs, that set me on the path I took? If we're going to have\
  \ a budding intellectual in the family, it's going to be me! And to hell with these\
  \ English writers! Being, as I alas remain, an utter monoglot was not going to stop\
  \ me reading foreigners in translation. Kafka! Albert Camus! Alfred Jarry! Thomas\
  \ Mann! Did I understand any of what I read? I am not sure that I did. I was, for\
  \ example, completely oblivious to the humour in Kafka. But there was another writer\
  \ with a reputation for being bleakly serious whose humour I got immediately, and\
  \ I laughed my head off as I read him (and still do).\nThe other great influence\
  \ on my reading at that time was my English teacher, Richard Shone. (\u201CWhere\
  \ does Mr Shone live?\u201D \u201CIn a Dick-Shonery!\u201D we chuckled.) It was\
  \ he who introduced me to Samuel Beckett\u2014the novelist rather than the playwright.\
  \ My sister had a copy of Waiting For Godot, of course, of course!, but my aversion\
  \ to the theatre, and more particularly my aversion to reading plays, meant that\
  \ I had returned it to her shelf after the briefest of glances. I cannot recall\
  \ how or why Mr Shone introduced me to Beckett's Watt. It was a revelation. I still\
  \ consider it one of the funniest novels I have ever read, uniquely mad and maddening.\
  \ From there I moved swiftly to Molloy and Malone Dies and The Unnamable. My first\
  \ attempts at writing were gruesome pastiches of Beckett. I can still spot echoes\
  \ of those four marvellous novels in the stuff I bash out today.\nI have no idea\
  \ whatever became of Mr Shone, who would be I suppose in his seventies now, if he\
  \ is still alive. But I think I can say that, by suggesting to me that I read Watt,\
  \ he planted the seed of the mighty larch or laburnum or cedar or plane tree that\
  \ is Hooting Yard. For which I owe him immeasurable thanks.\n[2012-02-15]"
