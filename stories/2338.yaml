text: "\u201CStrangle a pig and burn down the barn and doh-si-doh your partners!\u201D\
  \nIt was a rallying cry, and in its wake pigs were strangled, barns were burned,\
  \ and doh-si-dohs were essayed. How sweet the memory of those dances of my grandparents\u2019\
  \ youth. I was not alive then of course, so I have no direct memory, but I recall,\
  \ as an infant, sitting in a basket slung over one of grandpa's bison, and he goading\
  \ the beast along the lane, and telling me tales of his childhood in the Wenkenblatt,\
  \ the strangled pigs and the burning barns and the doh-si-dohs.\nHe told me how\
  \ he and my grandma met at such a rally, the one with a bale of straw and the other\
  \ with a can of paraffin, and how they kissed as they set a barn ablaze, and clambered\
  \ to safety over the corpses of pigs, and doh-si-dohed in the light of the flames.\n\
  It is another world. Now, pig protection teams stand guard over the sties, and barns\
  \ are built from fireproof panels, and the doh-si-doh is classed as a criminal act,\
  \ the penalty terrible. It is perhaps a more civilised world, even here in the Wenkenblatt,\
  \ but though I know it only from my grandparents\u2019 stories, still I miss that\
  \ rustic mayhem. There is a hole where my soul should be.\nI wander past the pig\
  \ sty and beat my fists upon the side of the barn, and very very quietly, so I will\
  \ not be overheard, I put my lips together and whistle a tune from the old pneumatic\
  \ hoedownolator, a mad and giddy tune.\n[2009-04-23]"
