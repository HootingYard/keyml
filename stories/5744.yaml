  Does our environment shape our language, or is it the other way about? Often, tracing\
  \ the links between the words in our heads and the things in the world outside our\
  \ heads is well nigh impossible. Sometimes, though, it can be child's play. Consider\
  \ this: I once lived among cowboys, all of whom wore leathern chaps, and in that\
  \ dusty desert town, men were invariably referred to as \u201Cchaps\u201D. Later,\
  \ when I spent some time in a blasted volcanic landscape riddled with geysers, I\
  \ found that all the men were called \u201Cgeezers\u201D. And when I retired to\
  \ an idyllic cove, sheltered by the happy disposition of cliff and bluff from the\
  \ wild boiling sea, I was not surprised to learn that the men there were all \u201C\
  coves\u201D.\nThough the term originated in thieves\u2019 cant, not one of the coves\
  \ in the cove was a thief, so far as I was aware. Several of them became my fast\
  \ friends. There was the one-eyed cove whose life's work was to translate the Abba\
  \ songbook into Latin; the cove who grew rhubarb in a hut abutting his house; the\
  \ snooker champ cove with his natty weskit and hair slathered in shiny shiny oil.\
  \ And then there was the cove whose tale I shall tell, who can only be described\
  \ as an enigma.\nHow to describe him? He was the most unemphatic cove I ever came\
  \ across, by which I mean that he singularly failed to make even the slightest impression.\
  \ He seemed to have no definition, no emphasis, neither vigour nor intensity. You\
  \ might see him every day, but in his absence be quite unable to recall what he\
  \ looked like. And when he spoke, which was often, alas, he spoke in a monotone,\
  \ neither fast nor slow, giving every single word equal weight. That might be thought\
  \ sufficiently odd to give him a certain curiosity value, and thus \u201Ccharacter\u201D\
  , but somehow the overwhelming sense was one of blankness. He was so unemphatic\
  \ that it seemed he did not even disturb the atoms in the air when he entered a\
  \ room.\nOne would think such a cove would make no mark upon our cove, but he did.\
  \ It was the night of the storm so ferocious that ever after it was called the Ferocious\
  \ Storm. We were snugly sheltered in our cove, of course, but beyond the cliff and\
  \ bluff the sea was a hideous seething broiling monster of rage and roaring, whipped\
  \ by a wind that lashed and howled as if demons were unloosed. At the height of\
  \ the storm, the lantern in the lighthouse off the cove was extinguished. We coves\
  \ gathered in the tavern, fearing shipwreck, hating the thought of having to provide\
  \ succour to half-drowned sailors, battered and lacerated on the jagged rocks, for\
  \ we were cowardly and selfish coves and we liked our idyllic cove just as it was.\n\
  And then the singularly unemphatic cove said something, in his blank unmemorable\
  \ monotone, and he walked out of the tavern and climbed up on to a promontory overlooking\
  \ the wild and pitiless sea. He took off his topcoat and his wooly and his shirt,\
  \ and he simply stood there, all night, in the teeth of the gale. For beneath his\
  \ shirt he wore a vest, and what a vest! It was golden, and luminous, and it shone\
  \ brighter than the sun. For ships in peril on the sea, it was a warning signal,\
  \ a thousand times more brilliant than the poor extinguished lantern of our lighthouse.\
  \ When dawn eventually came, and the storm died, not a ship had been wrecked upon\
  \ the rocks, not a sailor came crawling, bedraggled and bloody, begging for our\
  \ help. Atop the promontory, the unemphatic cove put on his shirt and wooly and\
  \ topcoat and made his way down to the tavern.\nWe were nonplussed and excitable,\
  \ firing questions at him. What in the name of heaven was that vest he was wearing?\
  \ How did it shine so brightly? Where did he get it? Blah blah blah.\nHe told us\
  \ everything we wanted to know. But so dull and featureless was his monotone that\
  \ everything he said went in one ear and out the other, and was instantly forgotten.\
  \ Over the coming days, one or other of us might have asked him to strip off his\
  \ topcoat and wooly and shirt and treat us to another look at the glorious vest,\
  \ but to do so we would have to have noticed his presence, and of course we did\
  \ not, for if anything he became even more insubstantial, more shadow than cove.\
  \ Eventually, he vanished altogether, as if he had never been. But I know he was\
  \ no mere figment, for today, up on the promontory, there is a stone statue of him,\
  \ stone eyes gazing at the sea, his stone vest painted the brightest yellow we could\
  \ muster, repainted every day, that it may never lose its lustre.\n[2010-12-22]"
