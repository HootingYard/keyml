text: "\nIn 1742 Jacques Benigne Winslow published a book entitled The Uncertainty\
  \ Of The Signs Of Death. Aloysius Batlip owned a pirated Finnish edition of this\
  \ important work, to which he referred each time a corpse lay sprawled on his mortuary\
  \ slab. It was his practice not to allow weeping relatives into the Chapel of Rest\
  \ until he was quite sure that the body was beyond all hope of resuscitation.\n\
  Hence he followed Winslow's advice to pour vinegar, pepper, and fresh, warm urine\
  \ into the supposedly deceased's mouth. But this was merely the first of a battery\
  \ of tests he carried out. Talc's cadaver was subjected to a panoply of often ferocious\
  \ indignities.\nBatlip tweaked the Professor's nipples with Dr Josat's formidably\
  \ sharp metal pincers, shocked his ears with hideous shrieks and excessive noises,\
  \ applied a thermometer to his rectum, rammed burning tapers up his nostrils, melted\
  \ sealing wax upon his chest, dipped a hammer into boiling water and pressed it\
  \ into the hollow of Talc's abdomen, plunged Monsieur Middledorf's flag-capped needle\
  \ into his heart, stuck one of Talc's fingers into his ear to listen for rolling\
  \ noises, carried out Snart's anal sphincter test, dusted the groin with kwantod\
  \ powder, and injected a solution of duggery into the spinal cord. Finally he was\
  \ satisfied, and with Chodd still acting as his helper, he prepared the corpse for\
  \ display.\n\u201CCleanse the body, Chodd,\u201D he said, handing his assistant\
  \ a bar of soap and a mop, \u201CI will gather the substances and equipment.\u201D\
  \nBatlip was justly proud of his embalming skills, and had won many cups and trophies\
  \ from the Institute of Finnish Sepulture. As Chodd, having completed his task,\
  \ wrung out the mop in a bucket, Batlip plunged a trocar into Lars Talc's abdomen\
  \ just above the navel, and thrust it in all directions until he had pierced the\
  \ stomach, intestines, rectum, bladder, and liver, sucking out bits of tissue, blood\
  \ clots, food, faeces, intestinal gases, and urine. He then pushed the trocar through\
  \ the diaphragm and into the chest, lacerating and sucking as it went. Pausing only\
  \ to snack on a conger-eel sandwich, he pumped preserving fluid into the cadaver,\
  \ and turned his attention to the face.\nWhen you die, your lower jaw falls downwards\
  \ and backwards, and the mouth hangs open, giving you the look of a dolt or a dunderpate.\
  \ With Chodd at his side, Batlip passed a needle and thread from the inner surface\
  \ of Talc's lower lip, up in front of his gums, through into one nostril, across\
  \ to the other nostril, and back again into his mouth behind the upper lip. When\
  \ the thread was drawn tight, by a fascinated Chodd, the lower jaw was pulled upwards\
  \ and forwards. Lars Talc looked pensive and wise, and would remain so for a week\
  \ or two, until his flesh began to rot.\nThey dressed him in a winding-sheet embroidered\
  \ with Batlip's monogram, leaving only his face uncovered. Then they transferred\
  \ him to the coffin and lifted it on to the slab, having first covered it with a\
  \ cloth of baize. And there, for the next few days, the great Professor Talc lay\
  \ in state.\n[2017-10-20]"
