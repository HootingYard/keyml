text: "In Act III, Scene III of Death's Jest-Book, or The Fool's Tragedy by Thomas\
  \ Lovell Beddoes (1829), Isbrand asks an important question:\nWhat is the lobster's\
  \ tune when he is boiled?\nAlas, he does not answer it, but goes on to sing a song\
  \ about an unborn ghost, a Nile crocodile, and a \u201Clittle, gruntless, fairy\
  \ hog\u201D. This is all very well, but I still want to know about the lobster's\
  \ tune. Can any reader point me in the right direction? Are there any contemporary\
  \ cover versions?\n[2011-06-19]"
