text: "\nI bet you lot would be impressed if I wrote a learned article about stoats.\n\
  \u201CGosh!\u201D you'd say, \u201CWe must admit to our suspicion that half the\
  \ time Mr Key hasn't got a clue what he's blathering on about. But with this piece\
  \ about the small scurrying mammal known as the stoat he has demonstrated extraordinary\
  \ erudition and a breadth of learning with regard to the natural world which knocks\
  \ us for six. Never again will we question the fact that he is the greatest writer\
  \ of the age apart from Jeanette Winterson!\u201D\nThat is the kind of thing I like\
  \ to hear, and to make sure you say it I turn my attention today to the stoat, and\
  \ a learned article thereupon. To bruit my erudition from the outset, I shall begin\
  \ by giving the Latin name of the stoat\u2014Mustela erminea\u2014and immediately\
  \ chuck in a literary quotation which makes mention of stoats:\nWeasels\u2014and\
  \ stoats\u2014and foxes\u2014and so on. They're all right in a way . . . but they\
  \ break out sometimes, there's no denying it, and then . . . well, you can't really\
  \ trust them, and that's the fact.\nYou will note that by employing this quote from\
  \ Ratty in The Wind In The Willows (Kenneth Grahame, 1908) I am also hinting at\
  \ my knowledge of weasels and foxes as well as of stoats. You may already be feeling\
  \ vaguely intimidated, which is all to the good. \u201CClearly Mr Key's learning\
  \ covers a wider and vaster array of subject matter than that to which he is confining\
  \ himself on this occasion!\u201D you are thinking, \u201CToday he chooses to enlighten\
  \ us about stoats, but it may equally well have been weasels or foxes, or the Lord\
  \ knows what else! Truly we must ask what we have done to deserve the privilege\
  \ of living at the same time as this most versatile of writers apart from La Winterson!\u201D\
  \nPausing briefly to allow you to get your breath back, to prostrate yourselves\
  \ in the muck before my shrine, or indeed to get out your chequebooks and donate\
  \ goodly sums of money to me, I then proceed to throw in another quotation, from\
  \ another eminent writer, to show that my stoat-reading has not been limited to\
  \ bestial fiction:\nStoats, though not as numerous as weasels, probably do quite\
  \ as much injury, being larger, swifter, stronger, and very bold sometimes entering\
  \ sheds close to dwelling houses. The labouring elder folk declare that they have\
  \ been known to suck the blood of infants left asleep in a cradle on the floor,\
  \ biting the child behind the ear.\nThat is from The Gamekeeper At Home. Sketches\
  \ Of Natural History And Rural Life by Richard Jefferies (1878). Now, if I started\
  \ wittering on about vampire stoats sucking the blood of peasant infants asleep\
  \ in their cradles, the likelihood is that you would throw up your hands and cry,\
  \ \u201CLord love a duck! There goes Mr Key, wittering on about vampire stoats sucking\
  \ the blood of peasant infants asleep in their cradles, painting an unnecessarily\
  \ gruesome picture of rustic life when it is quite obvious that he has never lived\
  \ in the countryside and knows little or nothing of its bucolic charms! Why we ever\
  \ gave him the benefit of the doubt is inexplicable! Let us cast him aside and turn\
  \ instead to the manifold genius of Saint Jeanette!\u201D\nAnd you would stand up\
  \ from your prostrate grovelment, tip over the Key Shrine with a contemptuous kick,\
  \ and tear up the cheque you had just written in my favour. That is what you would\
  \ do had I not mustered the authority of Richard Jefferies to bolster my picture\
  \ of rustic gruesomeness. As it is, you can only scratch your heads in wonder, acknowledge\
  \ that my stoat-learning is greater than your own, and grovel more, grovel better.\
  \ You probably also feel compelled to double the amount of money for which the cheque\
  \ is made out. You do that, in a shaking hand, as you await further stoat-revelations\
  \ from the keyboard of Mr Key. I do not disappoint.\nMost people's encounters with\
  \ a live Stoat are limited to a glimpse of a sleek, sinuous, brown creature dashing\
  \ across the road in front of a car to disappear among the roadside vegetation.\
  \ Seen at close quarters, Stoats are chestnut-brown above, with a sharp demarcation\
  \ line to pure white underparts. There is always a black tip to the tail. Should\
  \ you ever have the opportunity to examine a Stoat closely, do not be tempted to\
  \ look too closely at their teeth: a Stoat bite is unforgettable.\nIt is safe to\
  \ say you are overwhelmed. \u201CMr Key is really pulling out all the stops!\u201D\
  \ you say, \u201CNot only does he give us a vivid picture of the stoat's colouring,\
  \ such that we might draw one with crayons, but he demonstrates his care and concern\
  \ for us by his warning to avoid the stoat's vicious fangs! We cannot recall the\
  \ last time Jeanette Winterson sounded the tocsin to alert us to the biting of small\
  \ sleek mammals!\u201D\nBut therein, dammit!, lies my undoing. I have prompted you\
  \ to cast your minds back\u2014to the view of a dashing stoat through a car window,\
  \ to remember if or when Winterson ever showed she cared about you as much as Mr\
  \ Key does. Worse, I have reminded you that some things are unforgettable. Not just\
  \ the bite of a stoat, but, you now realise, that precise combination of the Latin\
  \ tag and the Grahame and Jefferies quotations and the paragraph that follows. They\
  \ seem strangely familiar, the more so when you consider the idiosyncratic capitalisation\
  \ of \u201CStoat\u201D. In a flash, you remember that you have read them before,\
  \ word for word, at the beginning of the entry for Stoat in Stefan Buczacki's Fauna\
  \ Britannica (2002).\n\u201CCan it be?\u201D you wail, \u201CCan it possibly be\
  \ that Mr Key knows nothing whatsoever about the stoat and has merely been copying\
  \ passages wholesale from a truly erudite author?\u201D\nAt which point I might\
  \ try to claim a case of unconscious plagiarism, or coincidence, or haunting by\
  \ the spirit of an (albeit still-living) author. None of which would be remotely\
  \ convincing, would they?\n[2012-09-24]"
