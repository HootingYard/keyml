text: "\nA number of readers and listeners have written to me on the subject of Hooting\
  \ Yard podcasts, generally along the lines of \u201COi, Mr Key! My life has become\
  \ barren and empty and devoid of purpose and it is all your fault. Where once I\
  \ could rely on weekly, or even twice-weekly, new Hooting Yard podcasts, nowadays\
  \ they only turn up once in a blue moon. What in the name of heaven is going on?\u201D\
  \nI ought to explain that I am as bewildered as my correspondents. Once a week,\
  \ more or less, I go to the Resonance studio and babble into a microphone for half\
  \ an hour, live on air. How any of what I say eventually finds its way onto the\
  \ ethereal mews and boulevards of Interwebshire has always been a profound mystery\
  \ to me.\nHowever, I have good news for all those of you biting your pillows in\
  \ despair. All episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air are now uploaded, regularly and\
  \ promptly, to the ResonanceFM Hooting Yard Soundcloud Archive. As I write, there\
  \ are twenty-eight shows online, with which to siphon out your ears. Turn on, tune\
  \ in, yelp with glee!\n[2014-01-27]"
