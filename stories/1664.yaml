  \ is one of the very few tools to be named after our avian cousins. Things have\
  \ come to a pretty pass when our habits of nomenclature are so bereft. It is in\
  \ an attempt to rectify this sorry state of affairs that the manufacturing arm of\
  \ the Hooting Yard Foundation is working on the production of an exciting new range\
  \ of ironmongery products, to wit: guillemot bolts; lapwing nozzles; lark basins;\
  \ coot clips; teal pins; bittern jacks; little bittern jacks; snow bunting tacks;\
  \ flamingo hasps; grebe locks; moorhen horns; corncrake hinges; raven sticks; tern\
  \ rotors; buzzard extractors; and pipit wrenches.\u201D\nWith much shame, and rending\
  \ of garments, I have to confess that in the five years since that was written,\
  \ not a single one of these fabulous products has yet appeared on the shelves of\
  \ our credit crunchy mongers.\n[2009-02-06]"
