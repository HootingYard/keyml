text: "Apparently, the Grunty Man, that figure of childhood nightmares, has a song.\
  \ It begins:\nI grunt at the sun, I grunt at the moon, my grunts do not follow a\
  \ tune.\nI grunt at the stars, I grunt at the sky, my grunting makes household pets\
  \ die.\nOne day in March 1967, the Grunty Man went into a recording studio. He was\
  \ accompanied by a hand-picked gaggle of musicians who later became some of the\
  \ biggest names in prog rock, including future members of Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer,\
  \ and Spooky Tooth. Also present was the youthful Gordon Sumner, now known to the\
  \ world as \u2018Stig\u2019 [sic], who was drafted in for his ability to whine in\
  \ a high-pitched caterwaul. I say they were hand-picked, but in fact the Grunty\
  \ Man arranged for each muso to be plucked from their mundane doldrums by the Claw\
  \ of Gack. It was an experience none of them ever forgot.\nEschewing the use of\
  \ a producer or sound engineer, the Grunty Man barred and bolted the studio doors\
  \ and whirled about in a grunting frenzy until all the musicians were suitably cowed.\
  \ It would be unkind to state which of the ELP trio was so frightened that he hid\
  \ in a cupboard and piddled in his loon pants until coaxed out with the promise\
  \ of Garibaldi biscuits.\nTen thousand years old and covered in sores, the Grunty\
  \ Man had recently started to use a guide dog. This dog, Alan, was some kind of\
  \ beagle, and was hopelessly inadequate for its task. It was blind itself, in one\
  \ eye, suffered from muscle spasms and liver failure, and harboured a doggy desire\
  \ to take part in the space programme rather than have to drag around with the Grunty\
  \ Man. It spent most of the recording session curled up inside Carl Palmer's bass\
  \ drum, dreaming of the stars.\nThe Grunty Man decided to call his one-off band\
  \ Ruddiman's Rudiments, after the Latin primer used by generations of schoolchildren.\
  \ With such a name, he thought, he would not be dismissed merely as a grotesque\
  \ grunting ogre from the earth's primeval past, but as a somewhat more sophisticated\
  \ being. Having a hit record would give him even more charisma, and his long-cherished\
  \ desire to win social acceptance would be fulfilled. Perhaps he wanted too much.\n\
  Certainly the auspices were not good, as the band huddled in a corner of the studio\
  \ quaking with terror, Alan snoozed, and no one bothered to locate the light switches.\
  \ When little Sumner whimpered that they would need at least some light to work\
  \ by, the Grunty Man unleashed great bellows of his sulphurous, phosphorescent breath.\
  \ The studio was lit by a dim green mist which hung in the air, and the band stumbled\
  \ reluctantly to their positions.They ran through the music a few times, but never\
  \ to the Grunty Man's satisfaction.\n\u201CLess Herman's Hermits! More Scriabin!\u201D\
  \ he shouted, and as they could not understand his grunts, he clawed the words onto\
  \ the walls with his talons. But none of the band, not even the bombastically-inclined\
  \ future Emerson Lake & Palmer, were familiar with the works of the Russian composer*,\
  \ and they stuck to a toothsome sort of pop pap. The Grunty Man kept bellowing to\
  \ maintain the phosphorescent light levels. Alan woke up briefly and savaged Carl\
  \ Palmer's piddle-stained loon pants. And then a janitor arrived.\nOld Ted Cargpan's\
  \ intention was to throw the intruders out of the studio. In the event, he saved\
  \ the situation. Completely calm in the face of the hideous Grunty Man, and contemptuous\
  \ of the young musicians, he at once sized up the scene, set the tapes running,\
  \ and put the whole lot of them through their paces. Even the Grunty Man deferred\
  \ to the janitor, retreating to a spot up in the rafters and allowing the little\
  \ Sumner boy to take on the lead vocal, while Alan the guide dog, refreshed after\
  \ his nap, howled backing.The instrumentalists, too, seemed energised by the crusty\
  \ old janitor's presence, Greg Lake in particular demonstrating the sort of skills\
  \ that would, in a few years time, make Brain Salad Surgery such a millstone. Sorry,\
  \ I meant to type \u2018milestone\u2019.\nThe track finished, Old Ted Cargpan sent\
  \ the musicians packing and brought the Grunty Man down from his perch near the\
  \ ceiling to record the B-side, a duet with Alan the guide dog. The Grunty Man grunted,\
  \ Alan slobbered, and the janitor moulded their din into a majestic three minute\
  \ miniature rock opera, subsequently plagiarised by everybody from Ultravox to swan-eating\
  \ Peter Maxwell Davies.\nSo whatever happened to the recordings? Some say that the\
  \ adult Gordon Sumner, wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice but still, as a middle-aged\
  \ man, calling himself \u2018Stig\u2019, opposed any reissue of the disc and even\
  \ had the master tapes destroyed. Another rumour has it that Alan the guide dog\
  \ somehow managed, in 1977, to get himself blasted towards Saturn on a space rocket,\
  \ and took the tapes with him. The Grunty Man himself remains silent on the subject,\
  \ merely grunting horribly in his cave, or next to his pond, haunting the nightmares\
  \ of tiny children, tuneless once more, and resigned to his immortal fate.\n* NOTE\_\
  : Much of the work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872\u20131915) was\
  \ written for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands were.\
  \ Indeed, there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he injured\
  \ them while relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands larger\
  \ than his own.\nTiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic Russian\
  \ cultivated a pair of decisive mustachios.\n\nAmong his orchestral works, the Poem\
  \ of Ecstasy, opus 54, is a supremely bonkers piece which, long before Spinal Tap,\
  \ goes up to eleven. One critic imagined he was hearing a graphic portrayal of the\
  \ players all having sex with each other. Another refers to the \u201Cmalignant\
  \ sneers from muted trombones\u2026 was music ever more evil-sounding\u201D?\nNot\
  \ everyone appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen to\
  \ conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony complained \u201CAfter Scriabin, Wagner\
  \ lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment now.\
  \ Where can one hide from such music? Help me!\u201D\nMy favourite Scriabin piece\
  \ is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art work, involving an orchestra,\
  \ dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed in the Himalayas, its playing\
  \ ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be \u201Ca grandiose religious synthesis\
  \ of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world\u201D and the emergence\
  \ of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny little hands\
  \ and decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed to septicemia when\
  \ the composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in the museum of lost or\
  \ non-existent works of art, about which I shall write more soon.\n[Previously posted\
