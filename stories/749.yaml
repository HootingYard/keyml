text: "Pansy Cradledew tells me that she has recently devised a new method of empowering\
  \ her pod-on-a-lanyard. Rather than plugging it into a socket in the wall, via a\
  \ recharger, she has obtained a piece of gubbins which is attached to her window\
  \ with a sucker. Wings on the gubbins are exposed to the glare of that blazing mighty\
  \ orb in the sky, the one John Donne rightly called a \u201Cbusie old fool\u201D\
  , and the pod thereafter is fed from the power stored in the gubbins.\nThis is all\
  \ very well, but it occurs to me that it could be the beginning of a slippery slope\
  \ which might see Pansy becoming an Aztec fundamentalist. Now that she relies, with\
  \ obvious enthusiasm, upon that burning golden disc for the empowering of her pod,\
  \ can it be long before she is tearing out the still-beating hearts from the breasts\
  \ of sacrificial victims upon a stone altar to assuage the angry Sun?\nBefore you\
  \ accuse me of overreacting, bear in mind that this is the woman who gleefully announced\
  \ only the other day that she had bought a DVD of The Royal Hunt Of The Sun for\
  \ \xA33. This is the film, you will recall, in which Christopher Plummer gives a\
  \ truly unforgettable performance as Captain Von Trapp Atahualpa. I rest my case.\n\
