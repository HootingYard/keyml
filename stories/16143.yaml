text: "\nYesterday's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air was the final show for the\
  \ Year of Our Lord MMXVII. As a special treat for listeners\u2019 ears, it included\
  \ a rather marvellous rendition of The Cuthbert Spraingue Song, for which Mr Key\
  \ was joined by the dulcet tones of Pansy Cradledew. Thereafter, there was a lot\
  \ of babble about an ogre, and Dobson, both on an atoll and in a pickle. Plus an\
  \ end note on Italian fascist Benito Mussolini.\nMeanwhile, don't forget that ancient\
  \ episodes of the show are being regularly added to an archive on YouTube.\n[2017-12-15]"
