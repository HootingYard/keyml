text: "Those of you familiar with the important Hooting Yard Book o\u2019 Days will\
  \ know that precisely six years ago today, the very first episode of Hooting Yard\
  \ On The Air was broadcast on ResonanceFM. I will be celebrating by drinking a flask\
  \ of aerated lettucewater and sacrificing a (vegan, marzipan) goat.\nOnce upon a\
  \ time, of course, radio shows were fugitive, ephemeral things, but today, with\
  \ the wonders of podcasting, untold hours of Mr Key's babbling remain available\
  \ for you to download from the ResonanceFM archive. Apparently, thousands of people\
  \ do, certainly more than ever read this blog.\nThis seems as good a time as any,\
  \ then, to note that a new podcast maestro has taken over the reins, whose self-appointed\
  \ task is to increase the frequency of releases. Past programmes have been issued\
  \ as podcasts generally about once a fortnight, but the plan now is for them to\
  \ appear twice a week, until the backlog is cleared.\nFor an insight into the tremendous\
  \ technical challenges of the process, I refer you to this piece from the 2006 archives.\
  \ Little has changed, save perhaps for the metal from which the maestro's hat has\
  \ been welded.\nMy thanks are due to the podcast maestro and his predecessors, and\
  \ you can make their dedication to this noble cause worthwhile by subscribing, downloading,\
  \ and listening, for so long and so often that Mr Key's voice haunts your dreams.\
  \ And please remember that the very existence of ResonanceFM is a fragile and rickety\
  \ thing, and your donations to the station will help it to survive.\n[2010-04-14]"
