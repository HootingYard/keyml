text: 'I know I shouldn''t allow such twaddle to exasperate me so much. I know it
  is a sign of weakness, even of imminent mental collapse, when one feels compelled
  to post a comment at the Guardian. But alas, I couldn''t help myself. To discover

  all the comments, mine is here. (It will be distressingly familiar stuff to Hooting
  Yard readers, of course.)
