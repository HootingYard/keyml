text: "It has come to my attention that an art person called Alan Disparte has a \u201C\
  work on paper\u201D entitled Hooting Yard, depicting transmogrified owls. Go and\
  \ look at it here, and at his main page, or portal*, here. Hommage or coincidence?\
  \ Who can say? I cannot help but notice that his name is an anagram of Natal Despair.\n\
  * Do people still refer to \u201Cweb portals\u201D, or has that phrase gone the\
  \ way of \u201Cthe information superhighway\u201D and other once thrilling coinages?\
  \ This is not the kind of thing I know about, although I think this very page you\
  \ are reading ought to be known as The Hooting Yard Portal, or Lobby, or Vestibule.\n\
