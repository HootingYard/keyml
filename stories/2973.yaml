text: "An exciting letter arrives from someone going by the online monicker \u201C\
  Flautist-standing-on-one-leg\u201D.\nDear Frank, he writes, I thought it might interest\
  \ you to know that some years ago, for an anniversary present, my wife arranged\
  \ for me to have my portrait done in linocut by the hyperrealist linocutter Rex\
  \ Hyper. It was our first wedding anniversary, and, alas, our last, for being a\
  \ fogwife Mrs F withered away due to the damp and fumous mists hovering o'er the\
  \ marshes, and was lying six feet under in the churchyard before our second.\nOn\
  \ the day the portrait was to be cut, I got dressed up to the nines and slathered\
  \ enough pomade into my bouffant to smother a guinea pig. Rex Hyper's linocuts had\
  \ made him so wealthy he had a private helipad on the roof of his chateau, but I\
  \ did not have a helicopter, so I made my way there via the funicular steam railway.\
  \ As we wheezed to the top and the brakes screeched, I saw through the smudged window\
  \ a sort of Praetorian guard of gap-year crusties. These, I was to learn, were Rex\
  \ Hyper's personal security detail. The man was a raving noodlebrain given to paranoid\
  \ delusions, who was convinced his helipad would be the site of an attack by giant\
  \ extraterrestrial bloodsuckers. Before I was allowed to disembark from the carriage,\
  \ I had to provide evidence via tape measure that I was not a giant, proof in the\
  \ form of a magnetic aura probe piston that I was of earthly form and origin, and\
  \ had my sucking mechanisms disabled so I would have been unable to suck Rex Hyper's\
  \ blood even if I had wanted to. When these procedures were complete, I was ushered\
  \ into the great man's presence.\nThe room in which he did his linocutting was cavernous\
  \ and impossibly beautiful. Every inch of walls and floor and ceiling was covered\
  \ in lino cut by the maestro himself. You could see it had that hyperrealist Rex\
  \ Hyper touch. It was almost like being in a real room.\n\u201CBof!\u201D he cried,\
  \ for no apparent reason, \u201CStrike up your pose for me!\u201D\nI did so. I thought\
  \ my wife would be pleased if, for the portrait she had commissioned, I posed standing\
  \ on one leg, my arms deployed as if I were playing the flute. I had not been allowed\
  \ to carry my flute on the funicular railway, it had a woodwind bias built-in.\n\
  The speed with which Rex Hyper slashed and rent his lino with great swingeing cuts\
  \ was awe-inspiring. Now I understood why he was known, in the linocutting world,\
  \ as the Billy Whizz of the Linocut. His paranoia meant that he was also known as\
  \ the Desperate Dan of the Linocut, and for his gluttonous and disgusting eating\
  \ habits he was called the Three Bears of the Linocut. Sooner or later he would\
  \ become the Little Plum of the Linocut, with a wigwam on the helipad.\nBarely forty\
  \ seconds after I had struck up my pose, Rex Hyper emitted an ear-splitting yell\
  \ of triumph, in what I took to be French. He tossed the completed hyperrealist\
  \ linocut across to me and swept out through a set of gaudy brocade curtains. A\
  \ couple of the gap-year crusties appeared, swiped my credit card through a swiper,\
  \ and hauled me off up to the helipad. I was hoping for a free helicopter ride,\
  \ but the funicular railway bell clanged and my dreams were shattered.\nSo successful\
  \ was the hyperrealism of the linocut that when I got home and bounded through the\
  \ door, my wife thought she was seeing two of us, me, a bit blurry and insubstantial,\
  \ and my bright, dazzling, impossibly fantastic doppelganger. Indeed, in the remaining\
  \ six weeks of her fogwife life she clung to the linocut, kissed it and wept upon\
  \ it, and expired holding it in her now withered white arms.\nAfter her death, I\
  \ hung it in the pantry, among the pickles and preserves.\n[2009-08-30]"
