text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Poppy Nisbet, I have been commissioned to write a book\
  \ entitled Fifty Anecdotes About Cream Crackers, and to date I have managed to find\
  \ only two true life cream cracker-related stories which are even mildly entertaining.\
  \ In your piece on the cardboard sign \u201CDepressed Horse Never Knew Saucepans\u201D\
  \ you write \u201CIt was not the cream crackers which unhinged me, as they have\
  \ done before.\u201D I would be very interested to know about the earlier unhingement\
  \ to which you allude, as it could provide invaluable material for my book.\nWell,\
  \ Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, I am happy to oblige, as they used to sing in the\
  \ old folk song \u201CPoppy Nisbet\u201D. To ensure my reply is as helpful as possible,\
  \ I consulted my papers to winkle out each and every cream cracker unhingement reference,\
  \ and I find that there is not just the one incident to report, but several.\nBefore\
  \ going into any detail I think it is important to point out that in these unhingements\
  \ there is no connection whatsoever, in either a literal or legal or moral or incoherent\
  \ sense, between the snackfood treat commonly known as a cream cracker (a sort of\
  \ glorified water biscuit) and the use of the word \u201Ccrackers\u201D as a euphemism\
  \ for mad, crazy, nuts, insane, deranged, bedizened, or, indeed, unhinged. I am\
  \ glad we have cleared that one up at the outset. I know from experience that all\
  \ sorts of misunderstandings can occur when readers think that there is a link,\
  \ either fearsomely strong, as with an iron chain, or more fragile, as with a gossamer\
  \ thread, between the snackfood and the mental or emotional condition. That there\
  \ can be such a link, I do not deny. Consider for example the case of the German\
  \ railway sleeping car attendant Ravilious, who was driven crackers by crackers\
  \ by dint of the word association, just as, later, he was to suffer abasement in\
  \ a basement and to be abused on a bus\u2014though what he was doing aboard a bus,\
  \ when loyalty ought to have limited his mode of travel to the German railway system,\
  \ is a mystery. Not an ineffable one, perhaps, such as the nature of God or the\
  \ alignment of certain tree clumps, but a mystery nevertheless, and one which you,\
  \ Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, may wish to investigate when you have finished writing\
  \ Fifty Anecdotes About Cream Crackers, assuming of course you do finish writing\
  \ it, and do not simply abandon the project through lassitude, blockage, or persistent\
  \ cramp.\nIf you do abandon the book, one excuse you will not have is a lack of\
  \ material, because I see, on looking through my papers, that I can furnish you\
  \ with no fewer than forty-seven cream cracker unhingement yarns. As you already\
  \ have two in the bag, as you say, then you need find only one more to tot up the\
  \ anecdote-count to a half-century, and, foof-la!, there is your book, done and\
  \ dusted.\nI realise it may beggar belief that one man can lay claim to forty-seven\
  \ separate episodes of unhingement by cream cracker, but I insist that I speak the\
  \ truth. After all, for what possible reason would I lie to you, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy\
  \ Nisbet? I am unlikely to benefit from having my anecdotes retailed, in your book,\
  \ presumably under cover of anonymity, an anonymity I will wish to preserve for\
  \ insurance purposes. In fact I would suggest that you invent forty-seven different\
  \ fictional characters to act as the supposed protagonists of the events to which\
  \ I shall make you privy. You can be quite explicit about such a manoeuvre, by which\
  \ I mean you need not pull the wool over your readers\u2019 eyes by pretending that,\
  \ say, Mr X or Ms Y or Dr Z stand in for three different \u201Creal\u201D people.\
  \ You may want to make it blatantly obvious that you are using made-up names by\
  \ co-opting forty-seven fictional characters who already exist, invented by others,\
  \ as I did when writing my as yet unpublished manuscript Forty-Seven Lightly Fictionalised\
  \ Accounts Of Ineffably Mysterious Tree Clump Alignment Shenanigans. The true life\
  \ heroes and heroines of these tales are disguised by obviously fictional names:\
  \ Emma Bovary, Martin Chuzzlewit, Tyrone Slothrop, Peason, Josef Bong, Raskolnikov,\
  \ Winnie Verloc, Lupin Pooter, Dolores Haze, Ravelstein, Arturo Ui, Winston Smith,\
  \ Grimes, Pinkie Brown, Geoffrey Firmin, Steerpike, Pointsman, Grabber, Myra Breckinridge,\
  \ Molloy, Pangloss, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Roger Thornhill, Guy Secretan, Ilya Kuryakin,\
  \ Clare Quilty, Lemuel Gulliver, Doctor Slop, Sara Lund, Inspector Truscott, Ned\
  \ Stark, Cissie Colpitts, Sebastian Dangerfield, Giles De'Ath, Ronnie Bostock, Ebin\
  \ Willoweed, Hans Gruber, Wendy Hale, Chance Hale, Watt, Prince Zaleski, Roger Ackroyd,\
  \ Evadne Mount, Arthur Gordon Pym, De Selby, Mike Hammer, and the man with the twisted\
  \ lip. You are quite welcome to use the very same pseudonyms in your forty-seven\
  \ accounts of my cream cracker unhingements, although you may of course wish to\
  \ pick your own, or even make them up entire out of whole cloth, if that is the\
  \ kind of thing you like to do, when fighting off lassitude, blockage, and persistent\
  \ cramps. I know I do.\nEarlier I described cream crackers as glorified water biscuits.\
  \ It may be of interest to you, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, that, when looking through\
  \ my papers, in addition to records of forty-seven unhingements by cream cracker,\
  \ I came upon no fewer than fifty-three derangements by water biscuit. Yes, yes,\
  \ I know, that too beggars belief, but there you go. I can only speak as I find.\
  \ It occurs to me that if, in spite of all, you are unable to come up with a fiftieth\
  \ anecdote for your cream cracker tally, you could renegotiate the deal with your\
  \ publisher and instead give them Fifty Anecdotes About Water Biscuits. I have all\
  \ the material you will need, and instead of having to root around desperately trying\
  \ to track down a fiftieth diverting and entertaining and instructive cream cracker\
  \ story, you would simply have to discard three of my water biscuit tales. Alternatively,\
  \ I could do that for you, sending you just the fifty you need, each one guaranteed\
  \ to be a full and true account of an occasion on which, for a variety of reasons,\
  \ I underwent a spell of derangement due to a water biscuit, or in some cases water\
  \ biscuits plural. That is the kind of stuff which I think would make any publisher\
  \ happy, or at least any publisher worth his salt.\nI am not going to digress upon\
  \ the salt content, or lack of it, in cream crackers and/or water biscuits, as that\
  \ way madness lies, or, if not madness, then at the very least unhingement or derangement,\
  \ as I know to my cost.\nSo, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, let me know by return of\
  \ post which road you wish to go down, the Avenue De Cream Crackers or the Boulevard\
  \ Du Water Biscuits. I will then send you a very lengthy screed, which you may fillet\
  \ or primp, as you so wish.\n[2011-07-14]"
