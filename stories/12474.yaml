text: "A Quaker once said to me \u201CI haven't had a single thought in my head for\
  \ about three months. It's wonderful!\u201D Give or take two and seven-eighths months,\
  \ that is pretty much the state of Mr Key's inner bonce. Since I finished the bibliography\
  \ and notes earlier in the week I have been lolloping around with an utterly empty\
  \ head. Hence the eerie silence here.\nThe only problem with having an empty head\
  \ is that sooner or later one begins to come over all John Lennon circa 1967, and\
  \ that will never do. So, following tomorrow's jaunt to Bristol to recite sweeping\
  \ paragraphs of majestic prose at An Event, I am going to start cramming stuff into\
  \ my head again, sloshing it about in the manner of a sort of cranial tumble-drier,\
  \ and decanting it here, for your edification and instruction.\nHark! Hark! The\
  \ dogs do bark.\n  There's two of them on Noah's ark.\n  One is light, the other's\
  \ dark.\n  But we decide which is right, and which is an illusion\u2026.\n[Portentous\
  \ music, with strings.]\n[2014-03-09]"
