text: "So eminently quotable is Thomas Nashe that I have decided to post a passage\
  \ from his Lenten Stuff every day while I am reading it\u2014The Daily Nashe, if\
  \ you will. The Stuff is, among other things, a paean of praise to Great Yarmouth\u2014\
  though it appears he was sorely tempted to go further afield:\nI had a crotchet\
  \ in my head here to have given the reins to my pen, and run astray throughout all\
  \ the coast towns of England, digging up their dilapidations and raking out of the\
  \ dust-heap or charnel-house of tenebrous eld the rottenest relic of their monuments,\
  \ and bright scoured the canker-eaten brass of their first bricklayers and founders,\
  \ & commented and paralogized on their condition in the present, & in the preter\
  \ tense, not for any love or hatred I bear them, but that I would not be snibbed,\
  \ or have it cast in my dish that therefore I praise Yarmouth so rantantingly because\
  \ I never elsewhere baited my horse, or took my bow and arrows and went to bed.\n\
