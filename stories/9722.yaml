text: "Summer is here, and with it comes the annual Pointy Town Nincompoops\u2019\
  \ Bazaar. This year, as ever, the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar will be held in a particularly\
  \ pointy part of Pointy Town. Preparations are well in hand, and several nincompoops\
  \ have already laid out their stalls.\nThis year, among the bargains available to\
  \ punters will be antimony, breadcrumbs, curd, digestive biscuits, egg tapestries,\
  \ frozen milk, galoshes, hats, ink, joggers\u2019 funnels, kaolin, lemon meringue\
  \ pie, mother's wreckage, narthex rubbings, obsidian cat helmets, preening equipment,\
  \ quicklime, rusty pins, sausages, talc, urban pointy things, vulgar snoods, wax,\
  \ xylophones, yeast bags, and zookeepers\u2019 cushions.\nIn the Kathy Kirby Memorial\
  \ Tent we are promised Quetzalcoatl puppets, wind chimes, earmuffs, ratcatchers\u2019\
  \ trousers, tin, yoghourt, uncooked pork, instant mashed potato, offal, portable\
  \ anvils, anchors, sock hoists, damp cloth, fierce wild beasts, glue, hornets, jam,\
  \ kevlar dog helmets, limestone, zookeepers\u2019 pin-cushions, x-rayed innards,\
  \ custard, vinkensport scorecards, bait, noodles, and marzipan. There will be a\
  \ flag atop the tent, and a Tannoy belting out nincompoopised versions of the instrumental\
  \ bits from Kathy Kirby's chart-toppers, played on the glockenspiel.\nA map of the\
  \ site should soon be available, done in crayon and pencil by orphans from Pang\
  \ Hill Orphanage. The light is dim in the Orphanage cellar, and the orphans are\
  \ somewhat cack-handed, so the map may not actually be very helpful. As an alternative,\
  \ visitors can be guided around the bazaar by a goat on the end of a chain. There\
  \ is only one goat, so expect lengthy queues. The goat is an authentic nincompoop's\
  \ Toggenburg, with three natural legs and one made of wood. The wooden leg has been\
  \ given a slap of bright yellow paint to aid visibility in the more tenebrous areas\
  \ of this pointy part of Pointy Town, where the enormous pointy bits block out the\
  \ sunlight with pointy black shadows.\nIn the lee of these shadows are several specialist\
  \ stalls offering mole nets, nasal sprays, blood oranges, vapour, Chumpot patent\
  \ soap, xysters for bone-scraping, zookeepers\u2019 pin-cushion holders, lettuce,\
  \ kedgeree, jumping fleas, helicopter pilots\u2019 insignia, grease, froth, desk\
  \ tidies, string, asbestos, potato novelties, orpiment, isinglass, unhelpful maps,\
  \ yachting caps, trick propelling pencils, rotogravures, embossed badger badges,\
  \ will-o-the-wisps, and quince jelly.\nFollowing certain unspeakable tragedies that\
  \ occurred at last year's Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar, the organisers are at pains\
  \ to point out that no nincompoops will be armed to the teeth this time around.\
  \ Of course they should not have been allowed to bring all those pointy sticks and\
  \ poison-tipped pointy lances and pointy swords. Signpost chaos meant they mistook\
  \ the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar for the Nincompoops\u2019 Jamboree, which was unfortunately\
  \ scheduled to take place at the same time, and not that far away, but in a marginally\
  \ less pointy part of Pointy Town. That both the Bazaar and the Jamboree had a Kathy\
  \ Kirby Memorial Tent only added to the confusion, and the bloodshed.\nJust in case\
  \ anything untoward does take place this year, there will be an ambulance on site,\
  \ with a crate of bandages and various gooey substances. The ambulance will be stationed\
  \ next to, or near, or at least in the general vicinity of the inky-black fathomless\
  \ pond teeming with blind slithering horrors, next to the swings. For the duration\
  \ of the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar the swings will be chained up and electrified,\
  \ to discourage tinies from frolicking upon them. We do not want any swings-and-pond\
  \ mishaps, after all.\nIf you are crawling towards where you think the ambulance\
  \ is, pierced with pointy arrows like St Sebastian and rapidly losing both blood\
  \ and the will to live, but cannot find the ambulance, listen out for the klaxon.\
  \ The klaxoneer's podium is among the stalls selling zookeepers\u2019 pin-cushion\
  \ holder's padlocks, yapping dogs, x-box wiring, weird coathangers, vouchers for\
  \ dough, ungodly cravats, turps, siphons, rubber Beelzebubs, quartered pigs, pips,\
  \ orreries, nothing, muck, lumps, klaxons, jugs, impenetrabilia, horrid squashed\
  \ things, glove compartment tat, flimflam, earwiggery, dust, creosote, buzzy bees,\
  \ and aniseed.\nJust a reminder that you do not need to be a nincompoop to come\
  \ to the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar. For a small fee you can be made an honorary nincompoop\
  \ for the day, with a pointy cap and a badge and some embroidered emblems and your\
  \ arm in a plaster cast and a small sluicing procedure to your brain through a trepanned\
  \ vent, the trepanning carried out by a qualified nincompoop with a hand-held iron\
  \ pointy twisty boring and screwing contraption daubed in a gooey substance and\
  \ wiped clean with a rag between screwings. For directions to the Julie Felix Folk\
  \ Singing \u2018n\u2019 Trepanning Tent, follow the pointy arrows in the flowerbeds,\
  \ planted with lupins and phlox and bindweed and buddleia.\nOne small note about\
  \ the werewolves patrolling the site, fangs bared, howling. Remember that these\
  \ are nincompoop werewolves, and are generally harmless. They will cease stalking\
  \ you if you toss them a bucketful of liver and lights and other innards from something\
  \ freshly slaughtered. Even the innards of a goldfish or a newt will do. It also\
  \ helps to pat the werewolves on the head, as if you are not terrified of them,\
  \ and make gurgly cooing noises.\nTickets for the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar are available\
  \ from a number of pointy kiosks in Pointy Town, and further afield, in unpointy\
  \ places which aspire to pointiness. You will require several forms of identification\
  \ in order to purchase tickets. These include a bus pass, a three-dimensional computer-generated\
  \ hologram of your head, a fistful of your hair torn out at the roots, nail clippings,\
  \ voice-recognition tape-recordings made on a clapped-out old cassette player, a\
  \ letter from your priest, your dental records, a recent utility bill, and a replacement\
  \ bus pass for replacement bus services.\nThe Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar really is\
  \ a spectacular day out for the whole family, including the dribbling and incontinent\
  \ ones, and those with criminal records. Take your protein pills and put your helmet\
  \ on, and we hope to see you there!\n[2012-07-24]"
