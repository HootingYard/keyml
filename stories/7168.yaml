text: "Back in April, when I posted the words of \u201CDismantled Wooden Myrna Loy\u201D\
  , I suggested to Outa_Spaceman that perhaps the world was ready for a new setting\
  \ of this traditional folk song. And lo! he has recorded a splendid version with\
  \ The Midnight Car Park Ramblers. Listen and, with the aide memoire of the words\
  \ reposted below, sing along\u2026\nDismantled Wooden Myrna Loy by Outa_Spaceman\n\
  He came, clutching an Alpenstock, from the far Tyrol.\nHe joined the Baader-Meinhof\
  \ Gang, along with Astrid Proll.\nHe joined an English folk group, and sang a Fol\
  \ De Rol.\nAnd no one ever realised that he was a wooden doll.\nHis name was not\
  \ Pinocchio, a different wooden boy.\nOur hero's name, quite weirdly, he shared\
  \ with Myrna Loy,\nThat siren of the silver screen who brought filmgoers much joy.\n\
  Our Myrna was a terrorist and a folkie, a simple wooden toy.\nPinocchio's nose,\
  \ you will recall, grew longer as he lied.\nBut Myrna Loy's did not, he took truth\
  \ as his guide.\nWell, he only did so after Ulrike Meinhof died.\nFor on that day\
  \ his revolutionary fervour was cast aside.\nHe cast aside the folk group too, hey\
  \ nonny nonny no.\nHe met a man in a field, one man who went to mow.\nHe lay down\
  \ on the fresh-mown grass, he had nowhere else to go\nAnd Myrna Loy, when winter\
  \ came, was buried under snow.\nHe lay there until springtime, a wooden boy, frozen,\
  \ dead\nUntil he was found by urchins, who carried him to a shed.\nThey dismantled\
  \ him piece by piece, the urchins Lars and Ned.\nAnd then they had a game of football\
  \ with his wooden head.\nSo when you tour, with your Alpenstock, the fabled far\
  \ Tyrol,\nSay a prayer for Myrna Loy, the dismantled wooden doll.\n[2011-08-28]"
