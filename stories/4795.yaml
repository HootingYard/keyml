text: "Father Ninian Tonguelash, the Jesuit priest and self-styled \u201CSoutane-Attired\
  \ Nemesis of Sea Monsters\u201D who appeared in my dream yesterday, was, I would\
  \ have you know, a real historical figure. He is often thought to be fictional,\
  \ probably because the only reliable biography we have of him, by Pebblehead p\xE8\
  re, was published in the form of a series of short episodes between the covers of\
  \ pulp magazines such as Mildly Alarming Stories!, Yarns That Might Raise Your Blood\
  \ Pressure Just A Tad, and Vaguely Disquieting Tales. That the various scattered\
  \ pieces were never brought together as a proper book is one of literature's, indeed\
  \ life's, great tragedies, and the blame must lie squarely with Pebblehead p\xE8\
  re himself. For all his learning and wisdom and panache as a biographer, he was\
  \ a very bewildering person. Even just walking down the street, he left a swathe\
  \ of boggle-eyed bewilderment in his wake, and the captains of ships were ever reluctant\
  \ to have him aboard their pleasure steamers.\nBewildering, too, is his treatment\
  \ of the life of Father Tonguelash, quite apart from its being broken up into bits\
  \ and published in magazines designed for a readership of the semi-literate and\
  \ the timid and the nerve-bejangled. Although what research has been done seems\
  \ to confirm that Pebblehead p\xE8re\u2018s accounts are historically accurate,\
  \ indeed devastatingly so, each episode as written is almost identical. The general\
  \ schema is as follows:\n1. Father Ninian Tonguelash has just finished saying Mass\
  \ when an urchin sprints panting into the vestry to announce that a sea monster\
  \ has been sighted. Either a ship or a boat or a coastal hamlet is imperilled.\n\
  2. Without stopping to ask any questions\u2014even something as basic as in which\
  \ direction he should speed\u2014Father Tonguelash grabs a harpoon and a crucifix\
  \ and charges out into the wild and windy shoreland. It is invariably wild and windy.\n\
  3. After a little while of harum scarum scampering, the priest stops, as Christ\
  \ stopped at Eboli, and, all windswept and resolute, takes from his pocket a volume\
  \ of poems by his friend and colleague Father Gerard Manley Hopkins. He opens the\
  \ book at random and declaims a poem, shouting into the wind. Declaiming done, he\
  \ returns the book to his pocket, makes the sign of the cross, and scampers onward.\
  \ The panting urchin who brought the message of sea monster peril has now had time\
  \ to catch up with the priest, and sticks close to his heels.\n4. Father Ninian\
  \ arrives at the scene of imperilment and confronts the sea monster. He is absolutely\
  \ fearless. \u201CI am attired in the soutane of a Jesuit, and I am your Nemesis!\u201D\
  \ he cries. At this point the sea monster usually makes a gurgling sound we are\
  \ led to interpret as a plea for God's ineffable mercy. But Father Ninian shows\
  \ none. He hands the crucifix to the panting urchin, telling the lad to brandish\
  \ it at the sea monster. Then he launches the harpoon, with unerring accuracy, felling\
  \ the sea monster instantly.\n5. It is an interesting point that all of the sea\
  \ monsters harpooned by the Jesuit were of the kind that, when struck, shrivel up\
  \ and vanish in a puff of cloudy gaseous green vapour.\n6. Father Tonguelash reels\
  \ in his harpoon, pats the panting urchin on the head, retrieves his crucifix, and\
  \ acknowledges the grovelling gratitude of those whose imperilment he has quashed,\
  \ be they the crew of a ship or a boat or the peasant inhabitants of a coastal hamlet.\n\
  7. As the priest wends his way back to his vestry, Pebblehead p\xE8re does three\
  \ things. He makes note, based upon what sources he never reveals, of all the types\
  \ of birds in the sky and perched upon branches which the Jesuit, were he looking,\
  \ would see upon his journey. He makes some attempt, not always successfully, to\
  \ elucidate various sea monster references hidden in the text of the Gerard Manley\
  \ Hopkins poem declaimed by Father Tonguelash earlier in the episode. Lastly, and\
  \ characteristically, he ends each piece with a flourish of distinctively bewildering\
  \ prose.\nAs a tot, Pebblehead fils, the bestselling paperbackist, was taught this\
  \ \u201Cseven-point plan of literary composition\u201D, as his p\xE8re dubbed it.\
  \ Careful readers will still find traces of the technique in some of the potboilers\
  \ that pour out of the \u201Cchalet o\u2019 prose\u201D day after day. Consider,\
  \ for example, even so recent a blockbuster as The Jesuit And The Sea Serpent which\
  \ follows the pattern almost exactly, despite being over a thousand pages fat, with\
  \ a gold-embossed cover making it suitable for airport book kiosks.\n[2010-07-19]"
