text: "I am often accosted in the streets by wild-eyed maniacs who block my path and\
  \ jab me on the shoulder with bony fingers, demanding to be told how I arrive, each\
  \ day, at a topic to write about. As I am reluctant to divulge the true nature of\
  \ the Hooting Yard creative process, I usually babble sufficient nonsense to satisfy\
  \ my assailant, who allows me on my way. This morning, however, on my way back from\
  \ a circuit of Nameless Pond, I felt curiously impelled to tell the truth. Let me\
  \ reproduce the dialogue verbatim, or as verbatim as I can recall it, to give you\
  \ a glimpse into the travails of your favourite penniless scribbler.\nMe\u2014(sashaying\
  \ along, humming The Final Countdown (Tempest), by the European band Sweden\u2026\
  \ sorry, I mean the Swedish band Europe).\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014Oi! Mr Key!\nMe\u2014\
  Yes, my good fellow, how may I be of assistance on this rain-drenched morn?\nWild-Eyed\
  \ Maniac\u2014(blocking my path and jabbing me on the shoulder with bony fingers)\
  \ What are you going to write about today and how did you decide upon the topic?\
  \ Answer me that!\nMe \u2013 You mean \u201Canswer me those\u201D.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014\
  Quit stalling, buster, and spill the beans!\nMe\u2014Have you been reading decades-old\
  \ American pulp fiction, perchance?\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014Of course not! Like any\
  \ sensible wild-eyed maniac, I read only the dispatches from Hooting Yard, to the\
  \ exclusion of all else!\nMe\u2014Very astute, if I may say so.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014\
  You may. But now answer my question. I mean, questions.\nMe \u2013 Although I am\
  \ usually reluctant to divulge the true nature of the Hooting Yard creative process,\
  \ for some inexplicable reason I feel impelled to tell you how I arrived at today's\
  \ topic. Be warned, however, that my reply is only applicable to this particular\
  \ day in the middle of June in the year of Our Lord MMXII.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014\
  Bob's your uncle.\nMe \u2013 In spite of the song I chose to be humming when you\
  \ accosted me, I am, as you are probably well aware, curiously obsessed with Jethro\
  \ Tull. God knows why. That being the case, my very first thought, on waking, before\
  \ I even plunged my head into a pail of icy water, was of the early albums of Jethro\
  \ Tull, and how perhaps Ian Anderson could be said to have lost his mojo circa 1974.\
  \ Some would say even earlier, perhaps in 1972. Whichever date one chooses, I suspect\
  \ there is general agreement that the band's best work, and the work for which it\
  \ will be remembered, yea unto every generation, appears on those first few releases.\
  \ Of those, however, the debut album This Was (1968) is sometimes overlooked, possibly\
  \ because of the strong blues influence and the presence of Mick Abrahams as a creative\
  \ rival to Anderson\u2014two things which are of course connected. In that sense,\
  \ it is atypical of early Tull. Not having listened to it for a long long time,\
  \ I tried to recall some of the songs, and the one that jumped to the surface of\
  \ my brain was Beggar's Farm. It was but a short step from there to making the decision\
  \ to write about a beggar's farm today. Not, I hasten to add, to write about the\
  \ song, but instead to appropriate the title, and write some majestic sweeping paragraphs\
  \ about a farm populated entirely by beggars.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014Gosh!\nMe\u2014\
  Before I could concentrate on the ineffable glory of my prose, however, I found\
  \ myself fretting away about the apostrophe in Beggar's.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014\
  This is absolutely fascinating, and it reminds me why you are surely the greatest\
  \ living writer of English prose apart from Jeanette Winterson.\nMe\u2014You see,\
  \ Anderson and Abrahams, as co-writers, seem to have had just one beggar in mind,\
  \ placing the apostrophe between the R and the S. But my farm, the one gradually\
  \ taking shape in my head, populated by beggars and indigents and tramps and drunks\
  \ and wretches, would demand the apostrophe after the S, to reflect the plurality\
  \ of beggars. Thus I was in a quandary. Should I entitle the essay On Beggar's Farm,\
  \ to reflect its fons et origo, or On Beggars\u2019 Farm, to more accurately signal\
  \ to the panting and overexcited reader what to expect?\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014\
  How on earth did you know that we Hooting Yard readers pant with overexcitement\
  \ as our Windows Vista computer screens are lit up each day by your latest scribblings?\n\
  Me\u2014I have my spies. But tell me, what would you advise regarding the placement\
  \ of that pesky apostrophe?\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014It's a tricksy one, make no mistake.\n\
  Me \u2013 I think it is important that I give due credit to the monopod flautist\
  \ and the founder of Blodwyn Pig. The idea of the beggar's farm is theirs, and theirs\
  \ alone, and I am merely plodding in their footsteps\u2014or, in Anderson's case,\
  \ footstep. I have always assumed he got from place to place by hopping, at least\
  \ while playing the flute.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014I have heard that is indeed the\
  \ case.\nMe\u2014At the same time, I do not wish my title to be grammatically incorrect,\
  \ nor to lead the panting and overexcited readers into thinking they will be reading\
  \ about a farm with only a single beggar in situ. I envisage dozens, if not hundreds,\
  \ of beggars, sprawled or lolloping about the farm, surrounded by rusty abandoned\
  \ farm implements and machinery, growing nothing on fields reduced to scrub and\
  \ gorse and bracken, rattling their tin cups at passers-by, moaning and keening\
  \ and displaying a variety of unsightly sores and scars and stumps resulting from\
  \ the amputation of one or more limbs. If the setting is shortly after a war, several\
  \ of the beggars may have been gassed in the trenches.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014I\
  \ can't wait to read it!\nMe\u2014But wait you shall, until I am able to work out\
  \ where to put the damned apostrophe.\nWild-Eyed Maniac\u2014(his attention suddenly\
  \ diverted, pointing at the sky) Oh look, a flock of swooping feathered beings with\
  \ wings!\nMe\u2014They are called birds.\nAnd so we went our separate ways, I returning\
  \ to my escritoire to struggle with an apostrophe placement crisis.\n\n[2012-06-15]"
