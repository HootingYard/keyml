text: "To Vange! We set out, the champ, the widow, and me, at break of dawn, hoping\
  \ to make Vange before nightfall. I knew little about my travelling companions.\
  \ I had no idea, for example, of what the champ was a champion, nor did I know whose\
  \ relict the widow was, nor for how long she had been wearing her widow's weeds.\
  \ They, in their turn, must have known almost nothing about me, save perhaps that\
  \ I was a fanatical devotee of Trebizondo Culpeper, whose glorious image shot forth\
  \ rays of golden light from the badge I wore upon my tunic.\nOur donkeys we had\
  \ abducted, with great daring, in broad daylight, from the beach where they were\
  \ employed to give rides to holidaying urchins. They were sturdy beasts, with a\
  \ surprising elegance in their carriage. I was well aware, as were the champ and\
  \ the widow, that laws exist to regulate the number of hours a donkey may be worked,\
  \ but I spat in the face of the laws, and my companions did too. We were determined\
  \ to get to Vange in a single day, and if in so doing we were to exhaust our donkeys,\
  \ then so be it. Trebizondo Culpeper's recorded pronouncements on donkeys are gnomic,\
  \ to say the least, and though I could not claim to have a full understanding of\
  \ them, I felt sure we were following the right path.\nBy \u201Cpath\u201D, I mean\
  \ of course the Way of Trebizondo Culpeper, not the path to Vange. Accustomed as\
  \ they were to the golden strands of their seaside resort, our abducted donkeys\
  \ would have been utterly discombobulated had we led them along the main arterial\
  \ trunk road to Vange, with its thundering traffic of container lorries and speed-phrenzied\
  \ vanborne riffraff. We chose instead to make our way across fields and greensward,\
  \ taking the occasional quiet country lane or abandoned railway line where the opportunity\
  \ arose. We had no map. Instead, we relied on the widow's profound, and in many\
  \ ways unnerving knowledge of the lie of the land. In less enlightened times they\
  \ would have burned her for a witch.\nOf\_ the three of us, only the champ had previously\
  \ been to Vange. One of the early heats in his progress to the championship had\
  \ been due to take place at Vange Marshes, and the champ was billeted in the village\
  \ beforehand. In the event, the contest was cancelled because of an unprecedented\
  \ starling storm, teeming millions of birds swooping over the marshes, and the champ\
  \ and his rivals were driven away in charabancs to a new location. When he spoke,\
  \ which was rarely, the champ's speech was punctuated with chuckles which I found\
  \ mightily disconcerting.\nMy own knowledge of Vange was based on a rotogravure\
  \ by the noted rotogravurist Rex Rotograv, which had been presented to me as a prize\
  \ for pursuivance by Trebizondo Culpeper's Inner Circle. I pored over this picture\
  \ for hours and hours, drinking in every detail, until I felt as if I knew Vange\
  \ itself. In truth, of course, I knew nothing, nothing whatsoever, of Vange, of\
  \ Vange Marshes, of anything at all, in essence. In The Ungrateful Beggar (1898)\
  \ L\xE9on Bloy reports his mother telling him: \u201CMy dear child, it is true you're\
  \ an ox, but an ox whose bellowings will one day astonish Christendom\u201D. Through\
  \ diligent study of the Way of Trebizondo Culpeper, I had eventually had drummed\
  \ into me my own ox-like stupidity. I had high hopes that my visit to Vange might\
  \ inspire my bellowings, which to date had been few, and those few incoherent.\n\
  When I published an account of an earlier journey by abducted donkey, to a village\
  \ that I mistook for Vange, it was suggested to me that I ought to have included,\
  \ through a kind of ventriloquism, the donkey's \u201Cthoughts and observations\u201D\
  . There are narratives that go in for that sort of thing, and no doubt readers who\
  \ lap it up. But Trebizondo Culpeper expressly forbids such misuse of our talents,\
  \ if talents we have, and he is surely right to do so. On the present occasion,\
  \ we had not even learned our donkeys\u2019 names, and that would have been a necessary\
  \ precursor to any attempt to burrow into their interior beings. For logistical\
  \ purposes, before we had even got clear of the beach, the widow had assigned to\
  \ each donkey a nonce name, but her choices were long-winded and multisyllabic and\
  \ did not serve their purpose. I have forgotten what they were.\nI have forgotten\
  \ more than that. But what I remember with absolute clarity, as if it were yesterday,\
  \ is how, as day became dusk and dusk darkened to night, the champ, the widow, and\
  \ I, upon our donkeys, guided at the last by a star burning bright against the black,\
  \ reached the end of our journey. There was Vange! And there, closer still, so close\
  \ we could stop and dismount and make the last few yards on foot, was Vange Well\
  \ No. 5! The domed building, like a Grecian temple, was falling to ruin after years\
  \ of neglect, its structure cracked in places, a cross beam detached, the render\
  \ upon the exterior walls in need of replacement, and little remaining of the original\
  \ lettering. There was still evidence of the other wells close by, and hidden in\
  \ the undergrowth was the concrete hard standing, where once stood a large wooden\
  \ hut that was used for storage. This was the last of five wells sunk following\
  \ the discovery, over a century ago, of magic water by self-styled farmer Edwin\
  \ Cash. It was highly sulphated, and he bottled it and sold it, labelled as Farmer\
  \ Cash's Famous Medicinal Vange Water, extolling its great medicinal value in curing\
  \ such ailments as lumbago, stomach troubles, rheumatoid complaints, and nervous\
  \ disorders. But then the sanatorium was built nearby, on higher ground, and its\
  \ drainage system contaminated the magic water, and the business collapsed, just\
  \ as the structure of Vange Well No. 5 was in a state of collapse, just as, after\
  \ a day riding our abducted donkeys, the widow, the champ, and I were close to collapse.\
  \ We had strength enough, though, working together, to sink our siphons into the\
  \ ground and suck up the magic water. We cared not that it was contaminated. In\
  \ the night, on the outskirts of Vange, we drank our fill, each for our own reasons.\n\
  The champ, plagued by lumbago, fearing that next season he would fail to retain\
  \ his championship, drank the magic water. The widow, martyred by stomach troubles\
  \ and rheumatoid complaints, drank the magic water. And me, with my nervous disorders\
  \ and my fanatical devotion to Trebizondo Culpeper? I drank the magic Vange water\
  \ too. I drank deep.\nAbove us, the bright burning star was extinguished, and we\
  \ were engulfed in darkness. We could no longer see each other, nor our abducted\
  \ donkeys. We could no longer see even the crumbling ruin of Vange Well No. 5. We\
  \ waited for the dawn, for a new day, for the transfiguration wrought upon each\
  \ of us by the magic water of Vange.\n[2010-01-21]"
