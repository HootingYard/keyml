text: "So. My harebrained scheme for 2008 is to turn Hooting Yard into a daily blog.\
  \ This will not change the fundamental character of your favourite website, for\
  \ it will continue to record the doings of the out of print pamphleteer Dobson and\
  \ all those other characters, such as the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage, who you\
  \ have come to cherish in your bosoms. But I thought I should make an effort to\
  \ be busier during those times when the muse fails to strike.\nBy looking at the\
  \ Categories list over to the right, I see that during 2007 I posted 99 pieces of\
  \ prose, which isn't bad going, but clearly trying for 365 would be foolhardy. Though\
  \ I prize the quality of foolhardiness more than most, I am not going to set myself\
  \ an impossible task. Brimming with enthusiasm as I am today, however, I can see\
  \ no reason short of idleness why the year to come cannot be packed with more entries\
  \ under Random Twaddle, Things I Have Learned, or indeed Quotations. The latter\
  \ has only one entry for the year just about to end, which I suspect is due to my\
  \ having shoved other quotations into the wrong category. And I think one thing\
  \ I have tended to neglect is drawing readers\u2019 attention to particularly splendid\
  \ items I find elsewhere on the net\u2014such as this piece about the Mundaneum.\n\
  I am hoping that the idea of a Daily Hooting Yard does not crumble to dust by, oh,\
  \ about the third or fourth of January, so bear in mind that suggestions and contributions\
  \ are always welcome from readers, either in the Comments or directly to hooting.yard@googlemail.com\n\
  Meanwhile, go and listen to Jubilate Agno again. It is \u201Cstrangely mesmeric\u201D\
  \ according to one correspondent, who tells me he has so far listened to it, all\
  \ the way through, four times. Very sensible man.\n[2007-12-31]"
