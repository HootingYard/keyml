  \ the home for the past eight years of the world's most Hooting Yardist radio programme,\
  \ Hooting Yard On The Air. Says Dr Baxter:\nResonance 104.4fm's annual on-air fund\
  \ raiser runs all this week till midnight on Sunday the 19th of February. If you\
  \ love Resonance104.4fm and the broadcasts made by our astonishing array of presenters,\

  \ The\_alternative\u2014for the station to take regular on-air advertising\u2014\
  is something we'd all prefer not to contemplate. But as it approaches its tenth\
  \ anniversary Resonance urgently need funds to continue its work. Visit resonancefm.com\
  \ to make a donation of any size. PLUS as usual we're having an auction of unique\
  \ and wondrous items, with contributions from David Shrigley, Bob & Roberta Smith,\
