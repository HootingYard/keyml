text: "My old man's a dustman. He wears a dustman's hat. Unless you are a dustman\
  \ yourself\u2014or a milliner\u2014you may be unfamiliar with the dustman's hat.\
  \ I am neither a dustman nor a milliner, but I am wearing my old man's hat as I\
  \ write, so I know exactly what I am talking about.\nJosef Vissarionovich Djugashvili,\
  \ the pockmarled, moustachioed Georgian, famously renamed himself Stalin, the Man\
  \ of Steel. At the height of the Solidarity protests in Poland in the early 1980s,\
  \ Lech Walesa was conflated with the Man of Iron of Andrej Wajda's film of that\
  \ title. Neither steel nor iron, my old man is a Man of Dust.\nI said that he wears\
  \ a dustman's hat, but then contradicted myself by saying that I am wearing it.\
  \ I ought to have said he wore a dustman's hat, before I stole it from him and plopped\
  \ it, at a decidedly non-rakish angle, on my own head. Just as I stole from him\
  \ his cardigan and his tobacco pouch and his Italian-made and unexpectedly stylish\
  \ Armando Del Foppo boots.\nI hasten to add that the old man is not my father. I\
  \ call him \u201Cmy\u201D old man because he is the latest in a series of old men\
  \ I have abducted off the streets and chained up in my attic. I help myself to whatever\
  \ they have about their person that takes my fancy, be it hat, cardigan, pouch and\
  \ boots or, say, wig, dentures, walking stick and ear trumpet, and I commission\
  \ Old Ma Popsicle to take up to them a bowl of gruel or milk slops once a day. But\
  \ being old, my old men invariably die within a few days. I haul the corpses downstairs\
  \ and into the garden and bury them in the flowerbeds under the Pointy Town moonlight.\
  \ Old Ma Popsicle is sworn to silence. I know far too much about her past for her\
  \ to blab to the coppers.\n[2014-07-22]"
