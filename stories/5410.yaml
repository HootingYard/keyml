  \ buried, like Chilean miners, deep in the Hooting Yard archives, dusted them down,\
  \ glued them together, and applied a lick o\u2019 lacquer to freshen them up for\

  \ may be raised by pedants on the lookout for flaws in what is a piece of startling,\
  \ even brutal, realism.\n[2010-10-15]"
