text: "Here is another newspaper cutting quoted in Deadly Encounters\_: Two Victorian\
  \ Sensations by Richard D Altick, this one from the Illustrated Times, 10 August\
  \ 1861:\nThat some unusual endemic excitement has been at work, directing weak,\
  \ debauched, and diseased minds into a homicidal course, must be apparent to every\
  \ newspaper-reader. May not the electrical condition of the atmosphere exercise\
  \ some hidden power in this way over the human brain? A correspondent of the Standard,\
  \ Dr. J. Q. Rumball, a well-known lecturer on science, points out electrical causes\
  \ as the origin of the potato disorder. It is a fact that lately the finest mechanisms\
  \ of clockwork, notably those at the Observatory at Greenwich, have been going wrong,\
  \ without visible derangement or imperfection, and this has been attributed to an\
  \ abnormal condition of atmospheric electricity. It is surely not a wildly-hazardous\
  \ theory to suppose that a similar agency acting upon that most susceptible and\
  \ complex of galvanic machines, the human brain, may have some tendency, if not\
  \ to the actual increase of crime, of lessening the healthy power which restrains\
  \ its committal or of aggravating the phrenal disease which but for such influence\
  \ might have been subdued, or at least retarded.\n[2009-07-19]"
