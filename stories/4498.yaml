text: "So, I was thinking, as I so often do, of the golden age of the Bodger's Spinney\
  \ Variety Theatre, and then, over at Ragbag, I came upon this marvellous list of\
  \ music hall acts:\n\u201CThe joy, perhaps as much in memory as at the time, was\
  \ in the variousness: the magician Ali Bongo (\u2018The Shriek of Araby\u2019),\
  \ the illusionist Cingallee, the pigeon act Hamilton Conrad, the animal and bird\
  \ impersonator Percy (\u2018I Travel the Road\u2019) Edwards, the drag act Ford\
  \ and Sheen, the mind-reader The Amazing Fogel, the lady whistler Eva Kane, the\
  \ male impersonator Hetty King, the foot spinner and raconteur Tex McLeod, the yodelling\
  \ accordionist Billy Moore, the human spider Valantyne Napier, the mental telepathists\
  \ The Piddingtons, the novelty xylophonist Reggie Redcliffe, the speciality dancer\
  \ Bunty St Clair, the pianist Semprini, the aereliste Olga Varona, and many, many\
  \ others\u2014inhabitants of a lost world.\u201D\nLater today I will be attempting\
  \ to contact The Piddingtons, via mental telepathy of course, and I shall keep you\
  \ informed of the ensuing revelations.\n[2010-05-23]"
