  presence\u201D on both Facecloth and Witter.\nThe Facecloth group is sunk in lassitude,\
  \ but it can be revivified if you lot all join up and start posting the sorts of\
  \ posts persons post on Facecloth, whatsoever they may be.\nThe Witter site is automatically\
  \ updated* every time Mr Key posts something here at Hooting Yard, which means I\
  \ never have to lift a tweety finger, thank heavens. But I understand that following\
  \ and retweeting things is a constant activity for half the planet these days, so\
  \ I encourage you all to get cracking.\n*NOTA BENE\_: Due to inexplicable and quite\
  \ possibly Lovecraftian forces at work in the aether, the updates have not been\
  \ appearing for several months. This should be fixed soon, possibly by the time\
  \ you read this.\n[2014-11-09]"
