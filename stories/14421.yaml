text: 'This is a brief reminder that each week''s episode of Hooting Yard On The Air
  is now posted on Mixcloud almost as soon as it has been broadcast. Delve through
  the archives and you can listen to Mr Key babbling into your eardrums until the
  cows come home. Yesterday''s show includes a sort of homage to David Bowie on his
  69th birthday, and the text appears in today''s Dabbler, so if you wish you can
  read and listen at the same time.
