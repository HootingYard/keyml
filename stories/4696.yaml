text: "\u201CI have had what, in many respects, I boldly call the misfortune, to set\
  \ my words sometimes prettily together ; not without a foolish vanity in the poor\
  \ knack that I had of doing so ; until I was heavily punished for this pride, by\
  \ finding that many people thought of the words only, and cared nothing for their\
  \ meaning.\u201D\nJohn Ruskin, The Mystery Of Life And Its Arts (1868)\nNo such\
  \ problem for Mr Key, I am happy to say, for judging by my bulging postbag, almost\
  \ all of my readers devote many hours to cogitating upon the meaning\u2014indeed\
  \ the multiple meanings\u2014of each and every postage at Hooting Yard. But just\
  \ in case there are one or two of you out there who still, tragically, overlook\
  \ significance at the expense of verbal blather, I thought it would be helpful to\
  \ pluck from that postbag one pertinent letter, and reproduce it in full. It is\
  \ from Tim Thurn, who can often be a picky wanker, but whose devotion to Hooting\
  \ Yard has never been in doubt.\nAhoy there, Frank! he writes, I thought you might\
  \ be interested to hear about the little routine I have devised for myself to help\
  \ me winkle out the deep and deeper meanings of your many and various postages.\
  \ This is what I do. As soon as I have finished reading, I get up from my chair\
  \ and go straight to the bathroom, wherein I fill the sink with ice cold water,\
  \ steep in it a towel, and then wrap the towel tight about my head. This is to prevent\
  \ my brain from overheating. I next gargle with Dr Baxter's Effervescent & Volatile\
  \ Gargling Fluid, and cut a few capers while gargling, though the vigour of my capers\
  \ is constrained somewhat by the cramped dimensions of my bathroom.\nThe next step\
  \ is to go down to my cellar, a dank pit which light never penetrates, and to lie\
  \ sprawled on the floor. Before sprawling, however, I fumble about in the blackness\
  \ to locate my vintage bakelite cassette player, and depress the knob which sets\
  \ the tape going. The tape, which is a loop and which is thus always ready to play,\
  \ is a recording of the Urbane Blodgett Sextet performing the song cycle Drink Ye\
  \ Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take You Away. I don't\
  \ know why, but I find this music perfectly suited to the cogitations I must now\
  \ embark upon while sprawled in the darkness. The Sextet's lean and flashy songs\
  \ grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw, which is my kind-a music!\nHours\
  \ may pass as I plumb the depths of my mental basin, thinking over the Hooting Yard\
  \ postage I lately read. Sooner or later, the meaning, or meanings, become clear,\
  \ and not just clear but incandescent. It is almost as if there is actual light\
  \ in the cellar. Almost. I fumble for the cassette player, press the stop knob,\
  \ and blunder my way up and out. The towel around my head is usually still damp,\
  \ so I wring it out over the bathroom sink and hang it up to dry before dashing\
  \ out into the streets to buttonhole passers-by with an excitable account of my\
  \ new knowledge.\nI thoroughly recommend this method of discovering the many, many\
  \ profundities inherent in the Hooting Yard oeuvre, and I am so grateful to you,\
  \ Mr Key, that I am even tempted to make a donation. But only tempted, for on reflection\
  \ I much prefer to wallow in a puddle of moral turpitude and filth, like the sordid\
  \ ingrate I am.\nPassionately yours, Tim Thurn\n[2010-07-03]"
