text: "Over in the right-hand column, below the pictures of the Hooting Yard book\
  \ covers, there languishes a little orange button inscribed with the words \u201C\
  Make a donation\u201D. Below this is another little chunk of text inviting you to\
  \ subscribe, which basically means you automatically make a donation every month.\
  \ Over the years, both the button and the text have tempted the occasional reader,\
  \ and I am very grateful for their support. (They know who they are.)\nToday I was\
  \ reading David Thompson's excellent blog and I felt impelled, after a smidgeon\
  \ of judicious editing, to copy and paste a passage from a recent postage:\nPatrons\
  \ are reminded that this rickety barge is kept afloat, just about, by the kindness\
  \ of strangers. If you've been remotely entertained over the years and would like\
  \ to help this dubious endeavour remain buoyant a while longer, there's an orange\
  \ button below with which to monetise any love. Debit and credit cards are of course\
  \ accepted. Think of it as a magazine subscription.\nThis is a very sensible piece\
  \ of prose, and I urge you to act on it. Make a one-off donation by clicking the\
  \ button below, or a regular monthly donation by heading over to that paragraph\
  \ on the right.\n\nNOTA BENE : For the avoidance of any doubt, following the guidance\
  \ above will of course result in donations to Hooting Yard. If, in addition, or\
  \ instead, you wish to donate to David Thompson, go here.\n[2014-08-28]"
