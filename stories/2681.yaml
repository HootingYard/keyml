text: "Watching an edifice crumble can provide a salutary lesson. I do not mean the\
  \ sorts of lessons government ministers are fond of announcing have been or will\
  \ be learned following the latest debacle. Such announcements are merely the craven\
  \ bleatings of incompetents. Andy Burnham springs to mind. How I wish he didn't!\
  \ No, the lessons we can learn from seeing with our own eyes the crumbling of an\
  \ edifice are of a wholly different kidney.\nI speak from experience, having witnessed\
  \ the crumbling of many, many edifices, the mighty and the modest, in my career\
  \ as CEO of Crumbling Edifice Solutions. Before we go any further, let me acknowledge\
  \ that \u201CCrumbling Edifice Solutions\u201D is something of a misnomer. Our role\
  \ is not to \u201Csolve\u201D the crumbling of an edifice, by which I suppose one\
  \ might mean nipping the crumblement in the bud, or at least trying to slow its\
  \ relentless progress towards utter devastation and ruin. We make no such claims.\
  \ What we do, with consummate swish, is to watch edifices crumble. We act as witnesses.\n\
  Let us say you know of an edifice that has begun to crumble. A hasty metal tapping\
  \ machine message to one of our satellite bureaux dotted around the globe will have\
  \ one of our agents on site within minutes, setting up a deckchair or camping stool\
  \ slap bang next to the edifice, equipped with a pair of opera glasses or prismatic\
  \ viewfinder. Our agent will fix a dispassionate gaze upon the crumbling edifice\
  \ until it is nought but dust, scattered in the wind. In most cases, an edifice\
  \ will crumble over many years, even generations, and thus we have in place a flawless\
  \ system whereby agents work in relays, one replacing another as and when necessary,\
  \ for example in the event of toilet breaks, lapses of attention, or death.\nAt\
  \ the point of complete crumblement, or CC as we call it in our organisational jargon,\
  \ the agent on duty will stash their opera glasses or prismatic viewfinder in a\
  \ pippy bag, fold up the deckchair or camping stool, and return to the satellite\
  \ bureau via funicular railway. All our offices are high above sea level, for up\
  \ in the empyrean the air is purer and thinner and conducive to la-la. Back at their\
  \ desk, the agent ponders the lesson learned from watching the crumbling of the\
  \ edifice, and writes a report. This is where their swish really comes into play,\
  \ for our agents are recruited not just for their crumblement observation skills,\
  \ but for their ability to write prose that has undeniable swish. When complete,\
  \ the report is bound in greaseproof wrapping and lodged in our archive, a purpose-built\
  \ edifice higher above sea level than even the highest of our bureaux, a granite\
  \ fortress, remote and inaccessible, with a tower, at the top of which is my own\
  \ office, from where I oversee the inevitable becrumblement of all that ever was\
  \ and is and will be.\n[2009-07-23]"
