text: "In a review of Ian Jack's The Country Formerly Known As Great Britain, Rachel\
  \ Cooke writes:\nAlmost all of these wonderful pieces were commissioned by newspapers\
  \ and magazines. They would never have worked, and would not now work, on the internet,\
  \ which is so very interested in speed and sensation and so resolutely uninterested\
  \ in well-researched thoughtfulness; in essays on bus conductors and Sundays and\
  \ the seaside; in all the small, strange things that make us who we are.\nThis seems\
  \ to me to be utter poppycock. There is abundant \u201Cwell-researched thoughtfulness\u201D\
  \ in Interwebshire, plenty about bus conductors and seaside resorts, and a cornucopia\
  \ of those small, strange things. Hooting Yard is merely one tiny haven of such\
  \ delights. And surely if one is seeking vapid drivel and \u201Csensation\u201D\
  , one need look no further than the Grauniad and the Observer (where the review\
  \ appears).\nThe book itself looks well worth reading:\nJack notes that 1956 was\
  \ the year in which he and his parents ate their first \u201Ctin of baked beans\
  \ that also included sausages\u201D, a meal taken while sheltering from the rain\
  \ beneath a bridge at Lanercost Priory, near Hadrian's Wall. \u201CMy,\u201D said\
  \ his father, \u201Cbut this is good!\u201D\nYou can rarely go wrong with a sausage\
  \ anecdote.\n[2009-09-06]"
