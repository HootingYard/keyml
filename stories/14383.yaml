  It has become the tradition here at Hooting Yard to herald the new year with a 2010
  quotation from Peter Hitchens. This year, his magnificent words appear over at The
  Dabbler, which has kindly added a puff for my book Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief,
  Brief Lives. Alas, this important work of reference did not, as I hoped, become
  a hugely successful pre-Christmas bestseller, so I shall probably be reduced to
  buttonholing strangers in the streets and imploring them to buy a copy, as I weep
  and dribble.
