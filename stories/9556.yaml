text: "In the midst of a storm, [Antonio Pigafetta] writes,\n\u201CThe body of St\
  \ Anselm appeared to us . . . in the form of a fire lighted at the summit of the\
  \ mainmast, and remained there near two hours and a half, which comforted us greatly,\
  \ for we were in tears only expecting the hour of our perishing. And when that holy\
  \ light was going away from us, it gave out such brilliance in our eyes that for\
  \ nearly a quarter of an hour we were like people blinded and calling for mercy\
  \ . . . It is to be noted that whenever that light which represents St Anselm shows\
  \ itself and descends on a vessel in a storm at sea, that vessel is never lost.\
  \ Immediately this light departed, the sea grew calmer, and then we saw various\
  \ kinds of birds among which were some that had no fundament.\u201D\nThis is not\
  \ a hallucination\u2014he is describing the electrical phenomenon known as St Elmo's\
  \ Fire\u2014but the language tends towards the visionary, and ends with this decidedly\
  \ odd seabird that lacks an anus.\nCharles Nicholl, in \u201CConversing With Giants\u201D\
  , collected in Traces Remain\_: Essays And Explorations (2011), quoting Antonio\
  \ Pigafetta, who met giants in Patagonia. Pigafetta was a supernumerary passenger\
  \ on Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation (1519\u20131522), one of the few who\
  \ made it back to Seville.\n[2012-07-01]"
