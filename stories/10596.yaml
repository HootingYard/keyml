text: "Let us conduct an experiment. I would like you to make a mental list of, say,\
  \ three or four of the most awful things you can possibly imagine. Do not stint,\
  \ do not shy away from the power of your mind to summon horrors. For our purposes,\
  \ your mental flights should be vivid enough for you to feel, physically, in your\
  \ innards, terror or disgust or nausea or panic or whatever else is appropriate\
  \ to the hideous visions swimming before you.\nDone? Now I will show you how I can\
  \ offer succour and solace and wipe away your terror or disgust or nausea or panic\
  \ in an instant. All I need say is: worse things happen at sea. See? At once, however\
  \ awful your imaginings, you are comforted by the thought that they could be much,\
  \ much worse, because worse things happen at sea. This must be true, for it is a\
  \ saw or a saying, it has gained currency by containing at least a germ of truth.\
  \ That is how a phrase becomes a saying. People repeat it because they recognise\
  \ a deep truth within it. Oft repeated, it becomes common, familiar to all. So nobody\
  \ would repeat the phrase worse things happen at sea if it were not true, if, however\
  \ awful a thing one might imagine, yet something even more awful would happen at\
  \ sea.\nWe can easily demonstrate this by comparing it with a different combination\
  \ of words, a phrase that is never repeated, has not become a saw or saying. All\
  \ goats cause mayhem, for instance. It is simply said, a doddle to memorise, and\
  \ in its syntactic structure identical to many a well-known saying. We can imagine\
  \ it in the mouth of a countryside character speaking in a generic BBC peasant accent.\
  \ Yet it is not said, because it is not true. Some goats cause mayhem, in particular\
  \ circumstances, but many more goats do not. So all goats cause mayhem is not a\
  \ saying. Worse things happen at sea is.\nThere is one flaw in the design of my\
  \ experiment. In summoning to mind three or four of the most awful things you could\
  \ possibly imagine, one or more of them might have been maritime. A shipwreck, for\
  \ example, or a boy stood on a burning deck, or the emergence from the depths of\
  \ the many-tentacled gigantic slime-covered monster known as the Kraken. In these\
  \ cases, for me to say worse things happen at sea would offer no succour nor solace\
  \ whatsoever. I am, in my terrible imaginings, already at sea, you clot!, you would\
  \ cry, and justifiably so. Next time I conduct the experiment I will rephrase the\
  \ premise. I would like you to make a mental list of, say, three or four of the\
  \ most awful things you can possibly imagine happening on land, perhaps. Though\
  \ the more astute among the class might guess where I am going with that one.\n\
  There is a pleasing universality to the idea that, whatever horror you may imagine\
  \ or, if you are unlucky, actually experience, you can take solace from the fact\
  \ that worse things happen at sea. By universality I mean that it is true in all\
  \ cases. This ought not surprise us when we consider how mind-numbingly vast the\
  \ sea is. It covers seven-tenths of our pretty globe. We speak sometimes of the\
  \ seven seas, but in truth there is only one, vast, as I have said, and salty, and\
  \ wet. Here and there, jutting out from it are land-masses, big and small, from\
  \ continents to eyots, but they are insignificant in comparison to the sea. It is\
  \ only to be expected that worse things than you can possibly imagine occur in the\
  \ vast salty wet briny deep.\nThe last time I conducted this experiment was to a\
  \ class of tots at a school community self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity-awareness\
  \ hub to which I had been invited to distribute prizes. Before handing out the gewgaws,\
  \ I had the tots give vent to their wildest and most horrible imaginings. Hysteria\
  \ ensued and a paramedic from a nearby clinic had to be rushed to the hall to inject\
  \ the more frantic tinies. This annoyed me, as I had hoped to bring a sense of calm\
  \ and the peace that passeth all understanding simply by telling them that worse\
  \ things happen at sea. Unfortunately, before I had the chance to do so, one precocious\
  \ tot shot his hand up, begging to say something.\n\u201CYes, yes, what is it?\u201D\
  \ I shouted in the exasperated voice I tend to assume with precocious tots.\n\u201C\
  One of the three or four awful things I have been imagining in my mind's eye is\
  \ the Grunty Man. I don't care what you say, he is equally if not more terrifying\
  \ than the Kraken.\u201D\n\u201CNonsense!\u201D I rapped back, \u201CThe Kraken\
  \ is a many-tentacled and gigantic and slime-covered monster which comes oozing\
  \ up from the briny deep and lays waste anything it can lash out at with its many\
  \ tentacles and it is so huge it can swallow great container ships whole!\u201D\n\
  \u201CYes, I know,\u201D said the infuriating tot, \u201CBut the Grunty Man is huge\
  \ and horrible and hairy and comes forth from his cave or lair and lays waste everything\
  \ in his path and his roaring is so loud that birds fall dead from the sky.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYes,\u201D said a second tot, without putting his hand up, \u201CAnd what\
  \ about the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopathic serial killer Babinsky? I have\
  \ been imagining him as one of my three or four awful things, and I am so petrified\
  \ that I have piddled in my pants. And I am known as the bravest, most courageous\
  \ tot in the community self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity-awareness hub and I am\
  \ captane of everything and winer of the mrs joyful prize for rafia work.\u201D\n\
  \u201CNow look here -\u201D I snapped, but such was the hubbub, the screaming, the\
  \ hysterics, the gnashing of teeth, the rending of garments, the piddling in the\
  \ pants, that I was drowned out.\n\u201CWorse things happen at sea,\u201D I bellowed,\
  \ unheard. And for the very first time, I wondered if the saw or saying really was\
  \ true. The scene before me was more awful than anything else I have ever experienced,\
  \ and we were far inland, very far indeed from the vast wet salty sea.\n[2012-11-11]"
