text: "You lot know I am a devoted fan of the preposterous television series Lost.\
  \ As, it seems, are millions of Iranians. The clamour for pirated DVDs is such that\
  \ the main video distributor in the country is putting the series on general release,\
  \ and talks are afoot for it to be shown on state television. So far, so good. But\u2026\
  \nProgrammes will be carefully censored to exclude \u201Cun-Islamic\u201D scenes\
  \ such as those featuring scantily clad women or male-female physical contact.\n\
  Given the beardy mullahs\u2019 usual ideas about what constitutes being \u201Cscantily\
  \ clad\u201D, given that none of the women characters shuffles about in a big black\
  \ sack, and given that men and women hang out with each other in a relaxed, trapped\
  \ on a tropical island kind of way, I am trying to work out which scenes will not\
  \ be censored.\nLost, the complete series\u2014now available in the digested three-minute\
  \ version!\n[2009-09-15]"
