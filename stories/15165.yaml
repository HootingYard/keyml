text: "I went to the shops and bought a Carlsbad plum. I ate the plum and threw the\
  \ stone at a swan. The plumstone hit the swan on its beak. I repeated this every\
  \ day for a week. Then the next morning I woke up in bed to find seven swans on\
  \ the pillow beside my head. They honked and pecked and I was undone, so I went\
  \ to the shops for another plum. But the plumster saw my savaged condition and damned\
  \ me to hellfire and perdition. \u201CI'll sell no further plums to thee\u201D he\
  \ said, and that was the end of plums and me. Now I choose to eat other fruit, and\
  \ non-fruit-based snacks to boot. As for the swans, they're still in my room, where\
  \ they will stay 'til I go to my tomb.\n[2017-01-27]"
