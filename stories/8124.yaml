text: "I remember the first time I saw the Beatles on television. It was a studio\
  \ performance of \u201CWe Can Work It Out\u201D, which the Wikipedia tells me was\
  \ filmed on 23 November 1965, so presumably I saw it a few weeks later. The Wikipedia\
  \ piece also tells me that in the film John Lennon was seated at a harmonium, but\
  \ I don't need to be reminded. I recall that clearly, because part and parcel of\
  \ the memory, for me, is my father announcing that the Beatles had \u201Cgone a\
  \ bit weird\u201D. No doubt he was thinking, not just of one of the fab four swapping\
  \ his guitar for a harmonium, but of their increasing hair length and the stirrings\
  \ of that transition from loveable moptops to drug-dabbling counterculture icons.\
  \ Soon enough it would become apparent that, as Bernard Levin said, and as I can\
  \ imagine my father echoing, and as I never tire of quoting, \u201Cthere is nothing\
  \ wrong with [John Lennon] that could not be cured by standing him upside down and\
  \ shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls out\u201D.\nThough\
  \ that is my earliest Beatle memory, the point I wish to explore here is that I\
  \ was already aware of them at this time. My father's observation made sense, I\
  \ recall, in a way it would not had they been completely new to me. That is, I understood\
  \ that they had \u201Cgone a bit weird\u201D. With two older sisters who were teenagers\
  \ in 1965, and who were in possession of a Dansette record player and a batch of\
  \ Beatles 45s (among other happening grooves), I would have learned about John,\
  \ Paul, George and Rudyard Ringo at some point before that remembered television\
  \ show. But when?\nEverything we learn, everything we encounter, happens on a particular\
  \ day. The day before, its existence, whatever it is, is completely unknown to us.\
  \ And then, one day, we hear about it, see it, read about it. Even those things\
  \ which seem so much part of the fabric of our world\u2014the Beatles. Shakespeare,\
  \ cornflakes, cats, tractors, Lembit Opik, lobsters, Ranters, the Great Dismal Swamp,\
  \ Googie Withers, the First World War, the Second World War, Evelyn Waugh, Auberon\
  \ Waugh, Springheeled Jack, marzipan, Austria, Orson Welles, fugues, fogous, geometry,\
  \ spinal fluid, Agamemnon, Potters Bar, Tony Blair, the Munich Air Disaster, haversacks,\
  \ rucksacks, knapsacks, Dirk Bogarde, the eurozone, synchronised swimming, raspberry\
  \ jam, \u201CAnd is there honey still for tea?\u201D, Blodwyn Pig, \u201Cper ardua\
  \ ad astra\u201D, Molesworth 2, Peason, Homburg hats, vinegar, junk bonds, crinkle-cut\
  \ oven chips, the Titanic, Kierkegaard, Savonarola, Henry Cow, Werner Herzog, lavender\
  \ shovels, egg nog, Ozymandias, jugged hare, Tinie Tempah, filbert nuts, ectoplasm,\
  \ squeegee merchants, suicide bombers, mad cow disease, Desperate Dan, Little Plum,\
  \ Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge, Brancusi, the Bible, blasphemy, Buggins\u2019\
  \ turn, Botany Bay, Bellerophon, the Bosphorus, Papa Doc Duvalier, creosote, Dagmar\
  \ Krause, invisible ink, Old Holborn, semolina, toffee, pictures of Jap girls in\
  \ synthesis, and so on, and on, forever and ever\u2026 there was, for all of us,\
  \ one day, we could pinpoint on the calendar if only we knew, or remembered, when\
  \ we learned of these people and places and events and things and breakfast cereals\
  \ for the very first time. There was a day when you had never, ever come across\
  \ jugged hare before. Then, one day, you read about it, or heard about it, or otherwise\
  \ learned of it. But how often do we ever remember those first encounters?\nI do\
  \ remember\u2014though I cannot say what the exact date was\u2014when I first heard\
  \ the word \u201Cinternet\u201D, in conversation with a geeky computer person. I\
  \ did not quite understand what it was, nor that it would ever have much relevance\
  \ to me, certainly not that it was something that would change the world I lived\
  \ in. I suppose that is the reason we rarely remember, that we rarely if ever recognise\
  \ that the new information we have just learned will have any significance. It must\
  \ have been within the past twelve months, I suspect, that I first learned of the\
  \ existence of Rick Santorum. He will almost certainly fade into obscurity. But,\
  \ if the voters of America \u201Cgo a bit weird\u201D, like the Beatles before them,\
  \ he might end up as the Potus.\nThe miraculous thing, in a sense, is that today\
  \ there is a distinct possibility I have encountered something, learned of something,\
  \ that will in future seem to me commonplace, obvious, everyday, something I cannot\
  \ imagine the world without. But I have no idea what it is, so I cannot record it.\n\
