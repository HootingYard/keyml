text: "Boffins at a lab somewhere in the Swiss Alps recently made a surprising discovery.\
  \ For years it has been believed that the only prose a person ever needed to read\
  \ for optimum stimulation of the cranial integuments is the various outpourings\
  \ of Mr Key here at Hooting Yard. Now, after experiments on the brains of rats,\
  \ voles, and Canada geese, and on plums, it transpires that turning one's attention\
  \ to other reading matter can actually be beneficial. Even moral pygmies can be\
  \ improved by works other than those of Mr Key!\nIn keeping with this startling\
  \ insight, and at the request of a couple of devotees, I have added to the site\
  \ a Reading List. This comprises, in reverse chronological order, every book Mr\
  \ Key has read since the beginning of the current year of Our Lord, MMXI. It does\
  \ not include books tossed aside in irritation or despair after twenty pages, nor\
  \ books where only bits and bobs\u2014rather than the whole damned thing\u2014were\
  \ read. It will be updated regularly.\n[2011-10-29]"
