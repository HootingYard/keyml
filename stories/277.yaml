text: "Nothing now would serve him but he must be a madman in print, and write a book\
  \ of Ecclesiastical Policy. There he distributes all the Territories of Conscience\
  \ into the Princes Province, and makes the Hierarchy to be but Bishops of the Air:\
  \ and talks at such an extravagant rate in things of higher concernment, that the\
  \ Reader will avow that in the whole discourse he had not one lucid interval. This\
  \ Book he was so bent upon, that he sate up late at nights, and wanting sleep, and\
  \ drinking sometimes Wine to animate his Fancy, it increas'd his Distemper. Beside\
  \ that too he had the misfortune to have two Friends, who being also out of their\
  \ wits, and of the same though something a calmer phrensy, spurr'd him on perpetually\
  \ with commendation. But when his Book was once come out, and he saw himself an\
  \ Author: that some of the Galants of the Town layd by the new Tune and the Tay,\
  \ tay, tarry, to quote some of his impertinencies; that his Title page was posted\
  \ and pasted up at every avenue next under the Play for that afternoon at the Kings\
  \ or the Dukes House; the Vain-Glory of this totally confounded him. He lost all\
  \ the little remains of his understanding, and his Cerebellum was so dryed up that\
  \ there was more brains in a Walnut and both their Shells were alike thin and brittle\u2026\
  \ so this Gentleman, in the Dog-dayes, stragling by Temple-bar, in a massy Cassock\
  \ and Surcingle, and taking the opportunity at once to piss and admire the Title-page\
  \ of his Book; a tall Servant of his, one J.O. that was not so careful as he should\
  \ be, or whether he did it of purpose, lets another Book of four hundred leaves\
  \ fall upon his head; which meeting with the former fracture in his Cranium, and\
  \ all the concurrent Accidents already mentioned, has utterly undone him.\nAndrew\
