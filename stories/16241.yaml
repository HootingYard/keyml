text: "In her \u201CMind Your Language\u201D column in The Spectator, Dot Wordsworth\
  \ turns her attention to jejune. It is one of those words (like fulsome) where an\
  \ erroneous usage is now so common that the correct, original meaning may be lost\
  \ entirely. Because of its similarity to juvenile and French jeune, jejune is misused\
  \ to mean childish, naive, callow. (Dot Wordsworth suggests George Bernard Shaw\
  \ may be to blame.) This is the (wrong) sense given in the finest use of jejune\
  \ in cinema history:\nWhat jejune actually means is thin, meagre, unsatisfying.\
  \ Thank heavens there is at least one man who uses the word correctly. Blockbusting\
  \ potboilerist Pebblehead has embarked on a new series of gaudy paperback potboilers\
  \ which purport to be sequels, or prequels, or simply complete rewrites, of acknowledged\
  \ classics. The first title to appear is Pebblehead's take on Richard Llewellyn's\
  \ 1939 novel How Green Was My Valley. Recalling the privations of his childhood\
  \ in Pang Hill Orphanage, Pebblehead's book is entitled How Jejune Was My Gruel.\
  \ It begins:\nHow jejune was my gruel. Oh, how jejune it was. I remember so vividly\
  \ how, when given my bowl of gruel in the orphanage dining hall, I was struck by\
  \ its jejunosity. Has ever a poor orphan child, who grew up to become an internationally\
  \ successful bestselling paperbackist, been faced with gruel so jejune? I think\
  \ not.\nA film adaptation of How Jejune Was My Gruel is currently in production,\
  \ starring anybody the producers can find whose career is not in tatters following\
  \ allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n[2018-02-14]"
