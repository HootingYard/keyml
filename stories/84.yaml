text: "There was a heroic bus driver, and his name was Kim Fat Goo. He drove his bus\
  \ through puddles. He drove it straight and true, though he swerved if he saw a\
  \ duck or a pig or an infant human tiny or a succubus or an incubus as he steered\
  \ towards the briny. He drove his bus across Pointy Town, heading for the sea. At\
  \ the beach he stopped to let passengers off and he drank a flask of tea. Oh, Kim\
  \ Fat Goo he drained his flask and he tipped the dregs in the sand, and he idled\
  \ awhile on the promenade and he watched a spaceship land. Out poured a gaggle of\
  \ alien beings with flippers and antennae and claws and flagrant disregard for the\
  \ rubric of Pointy Town laws.\n\u201CWe are an invasion force from the Planet of\
  \ Contaminated Wheat. We are starveling spacemen and we need something to eat.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI will drive you to the pie shop,\u201D said fearless Kim Fat Goo, \u201C\
  Get on the bus and sit quietly till we reach the pie shop queue.\u201D\nBut he drove\
  \ his bus up into the hills to a hermit's abandoned hut, and he lured the invading\
  \ spacemen in and sealed the doorway shut. So Kim Fat Goo the bus driver was the\
  \ saviour of Pointy Town, and that is why his name rings out with imperishable renown.\n\
