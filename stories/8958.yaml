text: "Often, if you are out of doors and crane your neck at such an angle that you\
  \ are looking up at the sky, you will see a flock of birds. Not always, but often,\
  \ often enough in any case to make my opening sentence credible. I strive, as a\
  \ writer, to be credible. I think all writers do. We want readers to believe what\
  \ we are telling them, if only temporarily, during the act of reading. This is the\
  \ case even with persons who write of outlandish and preposterous things, for example\
  \ those kinds of science fiction stories set in the distant future on far-flung\
  \ planets, where characters with names like Zybog and Kagvond try to prevent an\
  \ explosion at the weapons facility on Planet X-47215, while menaced by intergalactic\
  \ beings with tentacles and metallic parts. This is obviously tosh, but the writer\
  \ will try to make it credible. As soon as you put the potboiler or pulp magazine\
  \ aside, you can dismiss what you have just read as piffle. The important thing\
  \ is that you believe it while you are reading it.\nSo I do not think it is outwith\
  \ the bounds of reason to claim that, in peering up at the sky, you will often see\
  \ a flock of birds. It depends where you are, of course. Some areas are more bird-haunted\
  \ than others. If you are in a desert, you might see a flock of vultures, circling\
  \ over potential carrion, but probably not as often as, at the seaside, you might\
  \ spot a flock of seagulls. In fact at some seaside resorts, particularly those\
  \ with gigantic rubbish tips in the vicinity, it is hard to look up at the sky without\
  \ seeing teeming seagulls. The desert and the seaside are extreme cases, geographically,\
  \ but the fact that in both, or rather above both, one might glimpse flocks of birds\
  \ is telling, I think, in terms of my argument.\nNot all birds fly about in flocks.\
  \ Come to think of it, not all birds fly. The ostrich, for example, is a flightless\
  \ bird, and a remarkably stupid one. That being so, you are unlikely to read a sentence\
  \ such as\nAbove, a huge flock of ostriches swooped in the blue sky, silhouetted\
  \ against the blazing sun at noon on Thursday.\nwhich would probably cause you to\
  \ fling the book across the room in exasperation. On the other hand, you might find\
  \ it credible if the sentence was\nAbove, a huge flock of ostriches swooped in the\
  \ beige sky, silhouetted against the blazing suns at noon on Thursday at the weapons\
  \ facility on Planet X-47215, where Zybog and Kagvond were doing battle with intergalactic\
  \ beings with tentacles and metallic parts while trying to prevent an explosion\
  \ which would have unforeseeable effects on the space-time continuum.\nIn this context,\
  \ flying ostriches might be credible. Much depends on your tolerance for science\
  \ fiction. If it is low, you might still fling the book across the room in exasperation,\
  \ and go to find something else to read.\nIf a writer wishes to entertain you, however\
  \ fleetingly, with a scene in which a flock of birds is visible in the sky, they\
  \ will need to do a spot of ornithological research to ensure that the birds they\
  \ mention are indeed ones that fly about in flocks. One of the reasons for this\
  \ is that no writer is omniscient, and it may well be that among their readers are\
  \ persons who know more than they do about particular subjects. The ignorant but\
  \ wily writer can get around this by being non-specific, as in this example:\n\u201C\
  Gosh, Primrose, look! There is a huge flock of birds in the sky!\u201D\nThe risk\
  \ here is that the ornithologically-competent reader could find themselves wondering\
  \ what type of birds, precisely, are being pointed out to international woman of\
  \ mystery Primrose Dent in your exciting espionage thriller. In their wondering,\
  \ they are likely to become distracted and disengaged from the convoluted plot you\
  \ are doing your best to keep moving briskly along, and they might fling the book\
  \ across the room in exasperation. It would be better, then, to write\n\u201CGosh,\
  \ Primrose, look! There is a huge flock of starlings in the sky!\u201D\nas starlings\
  \ do in fact fly in flocks. Your bird-brainy reader will be entertained, and may\
  \ even impute to you more ornithological knowledge than you actually possess. This\
  \ is not without its own risks, but generally speaking the reader will bask in their\
  \ delusion so long as you do not get too carried away. Just because you know that\
  \ starlings fly in flocks does not mean that you can start blathering on about their\
  \ feeding habits, nesting patterns, lore and legend, and what have you, unless of\
  \ course you already know about these things. If you do not, but still feel impelled\
  \ to write about starlings\u2019 feeding habits, nesting patterns, lore and legend,\
  \ etcetera, to add a piquant starlingy quality to your prose, then for God's sake\
  \ submit your manuscript to a trained ornithologist before unleashing it upon the\
  \ world. This is particularly important if, in devising the character of international\
  \ woman of mystery Primrose Dent, you decide it would be apt to make her a starling\
  \ expert. If you cannot be bothered to do the research, or cannot afford the services\
  \ of an ornithology adviser, your best bet would be to make Primrose Dent an intergalactic\
  \ woman of mystery, and have her scooting about bent on espionage at the weapons\
  \ facility on Planet X-47215. That way, she can be an expert on space-starlings\
  \ rather than real, earthly starlings, and you can write whatever you like about\
  \ their feeding habits, nesting patterns, lore and legend, etcetera, because you\
  \ will be making it all up. Just don't forget to make it credible.\nIt may be that\
  \ you wish to peer at flocks of birds in the sky without ever writing a word about\
  \ them. In that case, take a pair of binoculars and a packed lunch, and stride up\
  \ into the hills, and gaze. Even in areas less bird-haunted, sooner or later a flock\
  \ of birds will appear in the sky, God willing.\n[2012-04-20]"
