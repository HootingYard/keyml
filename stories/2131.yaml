text: "The other day, Little Severin the Mystic Badger was seen scrubbling around\
  \ in a patch of wasteland. It rapidly became apparent that his scratching and snuffling\
  \ were in fact mystic prognostications about next week's G20 summit in London. We\
  \ asked an expert to translate Little Severin's prophecies into human prose.\nAnd\
  \ lo, people wearing woolly hats will take unto the streets. And there will be among\
  \ them many young folk of the middle classes. And in the streets they will shout\
  \ imprecations at anyone wearing a tie and they shall shout slogans also. And all\
  \ the omnibuses carrying poorer people to their work will become snarled up in the\
  \ jams of traffic. And there will be much incoherence and smug self-satisfaction.\
  \ There will be the throwing of pebbles and the smashing of glass and the claims\
  \ of oppression. And in the leafy streets of north London, in large houses, there\
  \ will be nodding of approval from academics and media folk equally oppressed. And\
  \ there will be no focus to the rage of those in woolly hats save their enjoyment\
  \ of unfocused rage. And in Bishopsgate the more well-heeled of the young folk will\
  \ set up a \u201Cclimate camp\u201D and shout ill-thought-out demands. And many\
  \ of these persons will fly off around the world in the summer on their \u201Cgap\
  \ years\u201D. And it will be seen as a great victory when many people are inconvenienced\
  \ or bloodied. And in the days succeeding much twaddle will be written and spouted\
  \ by those of the airhead persuasion. All this I foretell.\n[2009-03-26]"
