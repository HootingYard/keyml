text: "1. For reasons which remain obscure to me, the text of John Ruskin's Praeterita\
  \ is arranged in numbered paragraphs. At least, such is the case with the Everyman\
  \ edition which I am reading. I have seen other versions where the numbering is\
  \ absent. This practice is not a substitute for, but rather an addition to, the\
  \ conventional division of the text into chapters. The numbering, however, is continuous\
  \ through the chapters, so that, for example, Chapter II of Volume I (\u201CHerne-Hill\
  \ Almond Blossoms\u201D) begins with paragraph number 36. The book was originally\
  \ published in three volumes, and each has its paragraphs separately numbered, so\
  \ that Volume I contains paragraphs numbered 1 to 260 in twelve chapters, Volume\
  \ II 1 to 235 in twelve chapters, and Volume III 1 to 86 in four chapters, at which\
  \ point Ruskin abandoned it.\n2. The numbering of paragraphs does not support a\
  \ critical apparatus appended to the book, such as a commentary, notes, or what\
  \ have you. Hence my perplexity. It appears to be simply idiosyncratic.\n3. I have\
  \ noticed, while reading, that my eyes tend to glance over the numbers without registering\
  \ them. And yet, when I first opened the book, and saw the numbering, I found it\
  \ very pleasing. I cannot quite articulate why. Of course, it acts as a handy aide\
  \ memoire for any nuggets of arresting Ruskinian prose one wants to recall. However,\
  \ I think there have been quite enough quotations from Mr R. posted at Hooting Yard\
  \ over recent months.\n4. I am not sure what, if anything, is the purpose of this\
  \ post, other than to practise a bit of paragraph-numbering off my own bat. In my\
  \ experience, it is these odd and inconsequential postages which attract a greater\
  \ number of comments than usual. We shall see.\n[2009-08-05]"
