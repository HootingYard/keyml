  \ ballads entitled Songs For Drowned Kittens.\nBy curious coincidence, yesterday\
  \ I listened, for the first time in God knows how many years, to One Lonely Night.\
  \ This is a \u201CCold War operetta\u201D by The Massed Ranks Of The Proletariat,\
  \ adapted from the novel by Mickey Spillane. The lyrics are by Ed Baxter. It was\
  \ released as a severely-limited edition cassette tape in (I think) 1990.\nAnyway,\
  \ have a listen to Mike's death-wish songand you will understand why I was struck\
  \ by a spooky sense of connection to the past.\n[2017-01-31]"
