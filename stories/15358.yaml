text: "I have a terrible memory. I sometimes wonder if my inability to remember things\
  \ might have something to do with the ruinous debauches of my Wilderness Years,\
  \ but I suspect my forgetfulness preceded them, and that my memory was never much\
  \ cop in the first place. I barely recall much of what I have written and posted\
  \ here over the years. This morning, casting about in my puny brain for a topic,\
  \ I thought \u201CAha! I know! I will write about Dobson discovering the Pillow\
  \ Book of Sei Sh\u014Dnagon and deciding to write a Pillow Book of his own!\u201D\
  \nI got as far as writing an opening line about Dobson and Marigold Chew sitting\
  \ at breakfast one fabulously dreary morning in the early 1950s when a faint ping!\
  \ within my bonce halted me. \u201CI've already done this, haven't I?\u201D I said,\
  \ to a nearby sock, for want of any other interlocutor. The sock did not reply,\
  \ but a quick search confirmed that, yes, six years ago I wrote about this very\
  \ thing. Maybe you lot had forgotten about it too. Here it is again:\nCapacious\
  \ and pulsating it may have been, but Dobson's brain contained many, many pockets\
  \ of ignorance. He was in his mid fifties, for example, when he first came upon\
  \ the Pillow Book of Sei Sh\u014Dnagon, a work of which he had no previous inkling.\
  \ He did not read it, merely noting the title on the spine of a copy lodged on the\
  \ bookshelf of his friend Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp, the Sino-Dutch artist and\
  \ mountaineer.\nBack at home later that day, he mentioned it to Marigold Chew.\n\
  \u201CDid you know that an eleventh century Japanese bint wrote an entire book about\
  \ pillows?\u201D he asked.\n\u201CYes, Dobson, of course,\u201D said Marigold Chew,\
  \ \u201CI have borrowed it from the mobile library more than once, and read it from\
  \ cover to cover.\u201D\n\u201CSpeaking of the mobile library,\u201D said Dobson,\
  \ and he embarked on a long-winded and pettifogging digression upon the mobile library,\
  \ which in that place at that time took the form of a cart pulled by an elegant\
  \ yet tubercular drayhorse, the cart piled high with hardbacks covered in greaseproof\
  \ paper jackets, the drayhorse chivvied on its way by an equally elegant and equally\
  \ tubercular librarian-carter, a man of grim countenance and terrible personal habits\
  \ who bore a distinct resemblance to the actor Karl Johnson, noted for his roles\
  \ as elderly peasant Twister Turrill in Lark Rise To Candleford and as Wittgenstein\
  \ in Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein. In fact, it may even have been Johnson himself,\
  \ moonlighting as a mobile librarian to supplement his thespian earnings. Dobson\
  \ posited this possibility, but doubted it was true, as we, too, must doubt it until\
  \ all the evidence is in.\nSo implacable was the pamphleteer's babbling that Marigold\
  \ Chew was unable to get a word in edgeways, and was thus given no opportunity to\
  \ point out to Dobson that the Pillow Book of Sei Sh\u014Dnagon, like all pillow\
  \ books, was not actually a book about pillows, but a collection of lists and aphorisms\
  \ and observations and jottings and poems and opinions and anecdotes. Had he ceased\
  \ prattling for but a moment, Dobson would have learned this, and not, when eventually\
  \ he exhausted the topic of the mobile library and the greaseproof paper jackets\
  \ and the drayhorse and the librarian-carter and the actor and the fictional peasant\
  \ and the non-fictional philosopher, gone scurrying off to his escritoire to sit\
  \ and scribble the following:\nI have learned that a thousand years ago, a woman\
  \ from the land of Yoko Ono wrote an entire book about pillows. Such is human progress\
  \ that in the intervening millennium there must be much, much more to be said on\
  \ the subject. Clearly I am the pamphleteer to take on this daunting task. I shall\
  \ set to work on the Pillow Book of Dobson as soon as I have taken a nap. NB: The\
  \ nap will of course be research for my Pillow Book, as I shall be resting my head\
  \ upon a pillow while I nap, and present my findings as soon as I wake up.\nAs far\
  \ as we know, the promised \u201Cfindings\u201D were never written down. So refreshed\
  \ was Dobson by his nap that, upon waking, he immediately put on his Iberian duck\
  \ hunter's boots, grabbed an Alpenstock in his fist, and set out for a jaunty hike\
  \ that took him past the electricity pylons and the abandoned swimming pool and\
  \ the badger rescue station and the allotments. All the while he hiked, he concentrated\
  \ his mind on pillows\u2014a thousand years of pillows! His brain reeled as he struggled\
  \ to comprehend the sheer amount of material he would have to marshal in the making\
  \ of his Pillow Book. What advances mankind must have made in the field of pillows\
  \ since the eleventh century! How many heads had rested on how many pillows in that\
  \ time? How many dreams dreamt during pillow-assisted dozes and naps and even comas?\
  \ Pausing for a breather outside the bolted and shuttered off licence, Dobson suddenly\
  \ felt intimidated by the scale of the task before him. He watched the skies for\
  \ swifts and sparrows and starlings and other birds beginning with S. He rattled\
  \ the bolts on the off licence door. He chucked his Alpenstock into a ditch. And\
  \ then he turned for home, resolved to write, not a Pillow Book, but a whole series\
  \ of Pillow Pamphlets, each to tackle a single, manageable subsection of his vast\
  \ unwieldy subject matter.\n\u201CMarigold!\u201D he announced, bustling through\
  \ the door, \u201CI have had a brainwave with regard to my working methods on the\
  \ pillow project!\u201D\n\u201CI did not know you had embarked upon a pillow project,\
  \ Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CAnd what have you done with the Alpenstock?\u201D\
  \n\u201COh, I chucked it into a ditch,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CI shall go and retrieve\
  \ it later. But first I must write out the plan for my Pillow Pamphlets, updating\
  \ a thousand years of pillow history since Sei Sh\u014Dnagon wrote her book about\
  \ pillows long long ago in far Japan!\u201D\nBut so exhausted was the pamphleteer\
  \ by his hiking and his brain activity that before sitting at his escritoire he\
  \ took another nap. He thus set a pattern for what was to follow. Every time he\
  \ determined to set to work on the Pillow Pamphlets, he convinced himself that further\
  \ practical pillow research was necessary, and lay his head upon a pillow, and fell\
  \ asleep.\nThe project was eventually abandoned when the pamphleteer's attention\
  \ was distracted by cataclysmic world events, and he turned his energies to writing\
  \ his famous pamphlet On The Inadvisability Of Taking Daytime Naps During The Unfolding\
  \ Of Cataclysmic World Events (out of print).\n[2017-03-14]"
