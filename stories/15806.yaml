text: "\nThe seven members of the Electro-Magnetic Apparatus Museum Committee had\
  \ written a stinking letter to Lars Talc. Over fourteen pages of officially-stamped\
  \ notepaper, the signatories poured scorn on Talc's ticket designs, called into\
  \ question his ability to do the job as well as a half-trained ape, suggested that\
  \ he had cajoled Chodd into commissioning him for the work through bribery, questioned\
  \ his worth as a human being, and demanded that he repay, v\xE4litt\xF6m\xE4sti\
  \ and with interest, the monies he had been forwarded as an advance. The words inept,\
  \ vain, dismal, loose, immoral, incompetent, corrupt, and abominable recurred with\
  \ less regard for the felicities of style than with a determination to hammer home\
  \ a point.\nMinnie kept the letter hidden from Talc for some days. He was so pleased\
  \ with his prize, which he fawned over while cradling it in his wrinkled hands,\
  \ that she was reluctant to disturb his idyll. On the Thursday following the lightning-bolt,\
  \ however, Talc answered a tapping at the door to find Chodd standing before him.\
  \ Since last the Committee's creature had visited, Talc's temper had improved. Indeed,\
  \ Chodd was taken aback by his reception, as Talc ushered him into the sitting-room\
  \ and shoved a brimming tumbler of katajanmarjaviina into his hand.\n\u201CWelcome,\
  \ Chodd!\u201D yelled Lars Talc, with ridiculous bonhomie, \u201CWelcome indeed!\
  \ I have something very intriguing to show you, a prize I won from the scientifico-medical\
  \ club. Wait there while I fetch it, and help yourself to the booze. I won't be\
  \ a minute.\u201D\nTalc was about to sweep dramatically from the room, but Chodd\
  \ halted him.\n\u201CWait!\u201D he shouted, \u201CWe have more important matters\
  \ to discuss than your footling prize. This is not a social visit. The Committee\
  \ has sent me to collect its monies, with the application of rigour if necessary.\u201D\
  \n\u201CRigour?\u201D\n\u201CI have adjutants. They are waiting outside.\u201D\n\
  \u201CAdjutants?\u201D\n\u201CBrutes. Armed with thumping implements.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Monies?\u201D\n\u201CCrisp Finnish banknotes which I handed to you in a buff-coloured\
  \ envelope not two months ago. Your advance.\u201D\nMinnie, who was lurking in the\
  \ corner of the sitting-room, took the letter from her reticule and handed it to\
  \ Talc, who read through all fourteen pages while Chodd drained and refilled his\
  \ tumbler.\n\u201CPlease wait a moment,\u201D said Talc, when at last he had finished\
  \ reading.\nHe stalked off and returned a few minutes later, clutching his songbook,\
  \ and bid Minnie accompany him at the piano. It had long been his habit, when his\
  \ nerves were frayed and his feelings convulsive, to sing one of his many self-composed\
  \ pieces. Years before, he had had published, at his own expense, a compendium of\
  \ one hundred and fourteen of his songs, madrigals, chants, sea shanties, lieder,\
  \ serenades, cantatas, hymns, ballads, recitatives, and lullabies. The book also\
  \ included the libretto of his operetta based on the once-popular novel A Woman\
  \ Spurned by Ella Snowfury. One of the lasting regrets of Talc's life was that this\
  \ astonishing work had never been performed in public, although of course it has\
  \ become a staple of the Finnish repertoire since his death.\n\u201CNumber forty-nine,\
  \ Minnie,\u201D he announced. Minnie, who knew all the pieces by heart and had no\
  \ need of sheet music, splayed her fingers over the keyboard.\n\u201CA few words\
  \ of explanation before we begin,\u201D said Talc, glaring at Chodd, who had retreated\
  \ to the sideboard and was again refilling his tumbler. \u201CSong number forty-nine\
  \ is entitled A Viper On The Rug The instruction to the accompanist is to play fractiously.\
  \ There are some difficult passages, and the interplay between voice and piano is\
  \ at times dissonant. The rules of harmony are not only broken, Chodd, in this song\
  \ they are swept away in a revolutionary manner which to my knowledge has never\
  \ been accomplished by any other composer. Now sit down and pin back your nasty\
  \ little flat purple ears!\u201D\nWith a mighty crash on the keys, Minnie began.\
  \ She played for three minutes before Talc joined her, rasping out the lyrics in\
  \ guttural croaks. Although some of his song-texts were simple and straightforward,\
  \ Talc often favoured lyrics constructed in a highly-wrought language, rich and\
  \ allusive, peppered with wordplay shamelessly allowing him to display his superlative\
  \ mastery of intricate verse-forms. This has caused his translators much grief.\n\
  Pond, who first attempted an English translation of the songbook, struggled for\
  \ years before cutting his throat in a fit of despair. Shincramp and Wedge, working\
  \ in partnership, got halfway through the book before the former discovered that\
  \ the latter knew no Finnish. They had already published some of their translations\
  \ in the Journal of Wintermuck Studies. When Wedge's deceit was revealed, and their\
  \ work was examined by scholars of merciless acuity, the pair became laughing stocks.\
  \ Wedge, who had expected to be rumbled sooner or later, reacted with aplomb, and\
  \ turned his hand to petty theft, lurking in ill-lit alleyways down by the docks.\
  \ For Shincramp, however, the humiliation was too much to bear, and, like Pond,\
  \ he perished by his own hand, hanging himself from the rafters of a log-cabin in\
  \ the wild Canadian wastes.\nFrom time to time, other scribblers have taken up the\
  \ challenge of rendering Lars Talc's songbook into English, but it is fair to say\
  \ that the immense textual problems have, to date, defied truly inspired\u2014or\
  \ even competent\u2014solutions. The best we can do is to use Birdhole's edition,\
  \ which gives literal prose translations. Her version of The Viper On The Rug reads\
  \ as follows:\nIn my rooms of state, in which I prance, garbed in hideous robes,\
  \ there lies a rug. It is tasselled. On Monday, after I had been fed slops, I stole\
  \ into my rooms of state. Pins, tacks, nails. Where is my warming-pan? There is\
  \ a viper on the rug, and my arms dangle limply. The planets spin. Bring me the\
  \ tacks.\nThe text is repeated twice. As performed by Talc and Minnie, the song\
  \ lasted for twenty minutes, during which time Chodd finished off the bottle of\
  \ katajanmarjaviina, and opened another one which he found in the cabinet. He was\
  \ a quarter of the way through this second bottle when the song clattered to an\
  \ end, Talc wheezing and Minnie bashing the keys with terrible fractiousness. Chodd\
  \ slurped from his tumbler.\n\u201CNow get out of my sight!\u201D thundered Talc,\
  \ hurling his songbook across the room.\n\u201CYou wish me to call my adjutants?\u201D\
  \ asked Chodd.\n\u201CPah!\u201D\n\u201CSo be it.\u201D\nChodd, who could drink\
  \ anyone under the table, walked steadily to the door, opened it, and called to\
  \ his brutes. There were fourteen of them, but they entered in a whirling tangle\
  \ as one mass of teeming violence. Chodd pointed to Talc.\n\u201CSet upon this man.\
  \ Do not stint in your thumping.\u201D\nBefore the adjutants got an inch closer\
  \ to their prey, Minnie unleashed upon them a powerful spray of ig from a canister\
  \ which she had concealed inside the piano stool. As the jet of foam hit them, each\
  \ thug in turn was completely immobilised, as if turned to stone. Within seconds,\
  \ wisps of turquoise vapour curled about their heads, and their skins took on an\
  \ incandescent sheen. Chodd's troop of hired muscle was transformed into a ghastly\
  \ tableau, motionless and gleaming.\n\u201CThank you, Minnie,\u201D said Talc, taking\
  \ the canister from her. \u201CRest assured, Chodd, that your little gang will suffer\
  \ no lasting damage. Ig is potent, certainly, but not fatal. Oh, and the vapour\
  \ gives off a disgusting pong after a while. You will only have to tolerate it for\
  \ a week or two. Now, while Minnie summons a removal truck, perhaps you would be\
  \ kind enough to assist me in parcelling up your thugs. There is a huge roll of\
  \ greaseproof paper in the pantry.\u201D\n[2017-10-16]"
