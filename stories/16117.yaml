text: "\u2018Twas brillig, and I babbled guff\nUntil my listeners cried \u201CEnough!\u201D\
  \nAnd stopped my gob with a plug of dough\nAnd then it was that I knew woe.\nA woe\
  \ such as I'd never known\nNot e'en when I was skin and bone\nIn starveling days\
  \ of pimply youth\nBefore I grew so fat forsooth.\nFat and loud and babbling guff,\n\
  All roister doister swagger and puff,\nPuffed up like one of those eerie toads\n\
  That leap at you from beside the roads.\nWell, at least, they leap at moi.\nI wrote\
  \ of them in my memoir,\nThe text of which is what I brayed\nHoping to make my listeners\
  \ afraid.\nInstead they plugged my gob with dough\nAnd brought me down so very low\n\
  That now my life is full of woe\nAnd it is time for me to go.\nGo where? To the\
  \ seaside I suppose\nTo my seaside chalet o\u2019 prose\nTo thump my typewriter's\
  \ leaden keys\nAnd write of hornets, wasps, and bees.\n[2017-12-10]"
