text: "In today's botany lesson we are going to study a stalk of Fufton's Bladderwort.\
  \ We are going to examine it very very closely with the naked eye, and then under\
  \ a microscope, and then, from an exemplary distance, through a telescope. We shall\
  \ thoroughly sniff it, having first had our nasal passages cleared and fumigated\
  \ with a nasal fumigation siphon-and-pump contraption specially made for us by a\
  \ boffin.\nWe are going to test the effect upon it of both extreme heat and extreme\
  \ cold, as well as room temperature and other exemplary temperatures it is likely\
  \ to encounter in what can laughingly still be referred to as the \u201Creal world\u201D\
  . Thus far I have spoken of both distance and temperature as being exemplary and\
  \ I am not finished with my exemplars.\nWe are going to attach electrical wires\
  \ to the stalk of Fufton's Bladderwort and subject it to low and high voltages using\
  \ a targeted electrical voltage delivery contraption specially made for us by a\
  \ boffin. We shall designate one such voltage as an exemplary voltage, for reasons\
  \ which will become apparent.\nImmersion in a tub of water will be the next step.\
  \ We will be using water from the duckpond, having first boiled it and allowed it\
  \ to cool. The water will be collected from the duckpond in pails, then transferred\
  \ to a pan. It will be allowed to cool in the pan before being poured into the tub\
  \ through a funnel. Rubber gloves will be worn during this procedure. The colour\
  \ of the rubber gloves worn is open to choice, except that they ought not be the\
  \ same colour as the stalk of Fufton's Bladderwort. A rubber glove pigmentation\
  \ chart has been specially prepared for us by a boffin, and we shall refer to it\
  \ before plumping for our rubber gloves.\nWe will then test the pH value of the\
  \ stalk of Fufton's Bladderwort before breaking for lunch.\nLunch will be served\
  \ in the sixth floor canteen. The prices are reasonable and the queues are short.\
  \ There is a goodly selection of pies, cereals, chunks of unidentified meat, oats,\
  \ barley, thieveries from squirrels\u2019 winter storage, baked turnips, cocoa powder,\
  \ blood oranges, various animal innards, gravy in boats and gravy in a spoon, plums,\
  \ balsamic vinegar, toffee pudding, dentally-challenging biscuits and crackers,\
  \ clam chowder, wafers with a drizzle of light ale, pastries, dried citrus husks,\
  \ blancmange, lemon curd, bog sludge, and aspirins. The sing-song will take place\
  \ immediately after lunch in the sixth floor canteen annexe. Song-sheets in a bold,\
  \ hectoring typeface have been specially prepared for us by a madrigalist.\nUpon\
  \ our return we will slice up the stalk of Fufton's Bladderwort with a big sharp\
  \ exemplary slicing implement. There will then be a test paper in multiple-choice\
  \ format, to be completed in pencil. The rubber gloves should be disposed of down\
  \ a chute, the location of which will be announced in due time. Any questions?\n\
