text: "A thought has occurred to me\u2014possibly a rather foolish one, but then,\
  \ many of my thoughts are foolish, as I have no doubt are many if not most of yours,\
  \ dear readers. The previous postage, because it took for its subject the thirteen\
  \ Bierce siblings, all of whose names began with A, I chose to entitle \u2018A\u2019\
  . Once posted, I noted the elegant simplicity of it upon the screen, in contrast\
  \ to all those postage titles formed of whole words and phrases, some of which,\
  \ distressingly, fail to fit neatly on to a single line. This is when the foolish\
  \ thought bubbled up in my brain. Mayhap, I thought, I should entitle the next twenty-five\
  \ postages alphabetically, from B to Z. Their subject matter would, of course, be\
  \ constrained by the letter of their title. Thus I would be following an Oulipian\
  \ procedure for a couple of weeks at least.\nWhether or not this thought becomes\
  \ a plan and then an actuality, well, who can say?\nFile under vague, ill-thought,\
  \ pointless twaddle.\n[2010-09-17]"
