text: "\nOn New Year's Eve, you will recall, we published Old Key's Almanacke, a set\
  \ of eerily unerring prognostications for the coming twelvemonth plucked from the\
  \ aether by Old Key. Now, in today's Dabbler, Old Key's Almanacke reappears \u2026\
  \ yet each and every prognostication is different! What in the name of heaven can\
  \ this mean?\nThe best way to find out, of course, would be to question Old Key\
  \ himself. But where to find this eldritch figure, shrouded in a moth-eaten black\
  \ cape besplattered with stars, a pointy hat atop his potato-shaped head? Old Key\
  \ is famously elusive, and indeed some say he does not actually exist.\nEven if\
  \ he does exist, I have to say that the appearance of two entirely different sets\
  \ of prognostications casts doubt on the worth of Old Key's scrying skills. It may\
  \ be that, slumped over his fiendish diagrams in his mountaintop redoubt, he simply\
  \ makes it all up.\nADDENDUM\_: Dear Mr Key, writes Poppy Nisbet, I confess myself\
  \ befuddled. One minute you say you do not know where to find Old Key, and indeed\
  \ question his very existence, and then in almost the same breath you describe his\
  \ appearance and pinpoint his location to a mountaintop redoubt. If anybody is unreliable\
  \ here, it is you! Please explain what is going on.\nI would happily respond in\
  \ excruciating detail to Ms Nisbet, but unfortunately I have been issued with a\
  \ notice to cease and desist by Old Key's legal representatives. They have not specified\
  \ from what, precisely, I should cease and desist, and I am not taking any chances.\
  \ Nor would you, if you saw the huge malevolent snorting and stamping trio of horses,\
  \ Freeman Hardy & Willis, astride which the lawyers came thundering to my door.\n\
