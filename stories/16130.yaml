text: "Further to all the guff I mentioned about Hooting Yard housekeeping last week,\
  \ there was a little flurry of concern regarding the vanished ResonanceFM podcasts.\
  \ As a result, I have embarked upon a foolhardy yet I hope rewarding project to\
  \ upload hundreds of past episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air to YouTube.\nEt voila!\
  \ Here is the first fruit of my tireless efforts\u2014the very first show, broadcast\
  \ all those years ago on 14 April 2004. Malachy O'Neill was the sound engineer.\n\
  I am hoping that further episodes will appear on YouTube on a regular basis, until\
  \ the whole damned lot are there. This will take time. I am open to offers of help,\
  \ should there be any devotees out there thrumming their fingers idly on the windowsill\
  \ and staring into space, in need of some useful unpaid occupation.\nADDENDUM\_\
  : Episode Two (21 April 2004) also added.\nADDED ADDENDUM : A link has been added\
  \ to the sidebar to take you straight to the Hooting Yard home on YouTube. When\
  \ you get there, press \u201CPlay All\u201D, sit back, sluice out yer lug'oles,\
  \ & listen until the cows etrcetera etcetera \u2026\n[2017-12-12]"
