text: "Tiny Enid's diary for this day in 1934.\nMilk slops for breakfast, washed down\
  \ with gin. Read a fascinating article in The Ipsy Dipsy Doo about Mussolini, Il\
  \ Duce in faraway Italy. Having thoroughly digested it I decided to set off for\
  \ the railway station to make the trains run on time. This is precisely the sort\
  \ of activity a plucky tot such as myself ought to be engaged in.\nOn my way to\
  \ the station I encountered a tearaway pulling the wings off flies. I kicked his\
  \ head in and then made him glue the wings back on using a glue composed of his\
  \ own blood, spittle, and bone marrow. Then I made him swear a solemn vow to be\
  \ an upstanding citizen for the rest of his natural life. It is a shame such ne'er-do-wells\
  \ can no longer be transported to Botany Bay.\nThinking of Botany Bay made me think\
  \ of botany, so I paused by the railway embankment to pick some peonies and marigolds.\
  \ Because of my deeds of derring-do and penchant for violence people often forget\
  \ that I am just a simple little girly and take great pleasure in my flower press.\
  \ Sometimes I fancy I hear the flowers shrieking as I press every last smidgen of\
  \ life out of them.\nAt the railway station, the dithering old station master, Mr\
  \ Cribbins, was faffing about with flags and hooters. Needless to say he cannot\
  \ make the trains run on time. I lured him to some sidings by pretending my little\
  \ dolly was trapped in the rails, then buried him up to his neck in coarse sand.\
  \ I read him the riot act, or at least a version of it improvised by Il Duce, translated\
  \ into English by my mysterious mentor. Back on the platform, I took up Mr Cribbins\u2019\
  \ flag and hooter and deployed them in such a manner that I struck fear into the\
  \ hearts of train drivers throughout the land. It was a good morning's work.\nLater\
  \ I cut this picture out of a magazine:\n\n[2013-01-04]"
