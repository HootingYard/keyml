text: "\nOn the eve of 21 December [1937], Crowley rounded up representatives of the\
  \ white, black, brown, red, and yellow races\u2014according to William Hickey's\
  \ column in the Daily Express the next day the black representative was a dancing-girl,\
  \ the Indian a non-English speaking Bengali Muslim \u2018who seemed rather puzzled\
  \ by the whole business\u2019\u2014and at the foot of Cleopatra's needle at precisely\
  \ 6.22 a.m. on 22 December as the sun moved into Capricorn, presented each with\
  \ a copy of [The Book of the Law]. Acceptance was briefly delayed while Crowley\
  \ made a short speech:\nDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. I Ankh-f-n-khonsu,\
  \ the Priest of the Princes, present you, ______, as representative of your race,\
  \ with the Book of the Law. It is the charter of Universal Freedom, for every man\
  \ and woman in the world. Love is the law. Love under will.\nFra. N. , also present\
  \ together with the Express journalist, named Freedland, recalls the occasion's\
  \ less spiritual aspects:\nWe dined together and proceeded to pub and caf\xE9\_\
  crawl until the Jew, Indian, Negro and Malayan had been collected. It was very hard\
  \ keeping the party going until 6 a.m. . . It was one of the craziest evenings I\
  \ have ever spent, and none of the people picked up knew each other.\nCrowley's\
  \ diary is also light on religious significance:\nFreedland\u2014and even N.!\u2014\
  acted nobly. We collected the people of the 5 races, took them to the rooms of one\
  \ Erskine, a terribly dull party, brightening when we got rid of most of them &\
  \ started whisky. At Cleopatra's Needle [Mercury, i.e. Wednesday] 6.22 a.m. I presented\
  \ the 5 copies and made my magical utterance. And so to bed.\n22 Dec. 37. Hangover\
  \ v. bad.\nfrom The Books Of The Beast by Timothy D'Arch Smith (1987)\n[2012-10-08]"
