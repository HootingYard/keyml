text: "In 1927 Sylvia Townsend Warner attended a party at Edith Sitwell's house. She\
  \ did not enjoy it. \u201CThe room [was] full of young male poets and old female\
  \ rastas\u201D, she noted. I suppose rasta must have had a different meaning for\
  \ Sylvia, and she was not surrounded by elderly female rastafarians, though I prefer\
  \ to think this is what she did mean. The vision of Sylvia Townsend Warner, Edith\
  \ Sitwell, and several aged dreadlocked rastafarian women calling on Jah to deliver\
  \ them from their sufferation in Babylon is too splendid to be scuppered by foolish\
  \ matters such as historical truth.\n\n[2014-05-16]"
