text: "An extract from Mrs Gubbins\u2019 so-called Mission Statement:\n\u201CWe will\
  \ seek new ways to enhance our readers\u2019 Hooting Yard experience. For example,\
  \ we should strain mightily to harness the awesome power of the interweb to create\
  \ what I think are known as multimedia formats. We should exploit different platforms\
  \ and portals. The site will strive to be a critical hub for the Hooting Yard community.\
  \ Now get on with it! You can make a start by bunging in a few pictures so that\
  \ readers can visualise those Frankish kings mentioned in Annals Of The Frankish\
  \ Kings, or at least some of them.\u201D\nEver mindful that Mrs Gubbins has a matchless\
  \ grasp of what really matters in this often perplexing world, we have taken her\
  \ advice. Here, then, are three of those Frankish kings.\n\nPippin The Short\n\n\
