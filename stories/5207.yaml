text: "David McKie, who is always worth reading, had a piece in the Grauniad last\
  \ week about the first lines of novels. He refers to a reference work I had never\
  \ heard of, Novel Openers\_: First Sentences of 11,000 Fictional Works, Topically\
  \ Arranged with Subject, Keyword, Author and Title Indexing compiled by Bruce L\
  \ Weaver and published in 1995. No doubt one could spend many happy hours browsing\
  \ through it seeking out one's own favourites, cursing the absence of others, and\
  \ making new discoveries. It set me to thinking, by the by, that such compilations,\
  \ whether fat like Weaver's or brief and idiosyncratic like any number found in\
  \ books and magazines and online, seem invariably to focus on fiction. What about\
  \ arresting openings of non-fiction works? How about this, from Sword Of Wisdom\_\
  : MacGregor Mathers And \u2018The Golden Dawn\u2019 by Ithell Colquhoun (1975):\n\
  I was a schoolgirl sitting on a lavatory-seat and leaning forward so as to see into\
  \ the depths of an osier basket lined with newspapers. The closely-printed pages\
  \ carried an article by a young woman visiting an Abbey in Sicily and described\
  \ the strange goings-on there. The director of the place was someone whom she called\
  \ \u2018The Mystic\u2019 but did not otherwise identify: and his Abbey was far from\
  \ being an ordinary monastic establishment. I stayed put until I had read through\
  \ the two or three large pages, in spite of imperious rattling at the door.\nThat\
  \ certainly did what McKie says Bruce L Weaver suggests is \u201Cthe best way to\
  \ capture readers\u201D\u2014it instantly put me somewhere else and piqued my curiosity.\
  \ A page or so later I was introduced to an amusingly intriguing cast of characters:\n\
  I began to pick up dark hints about the activities of certain (unspecified) members,\
  \ of whom others were suspicious. The rumours centred around a third studio, situated\
  \ beyond the one used as a library, and their chief disseminator was the librarian,\
  \ a Miss Worthington\u2026 The members were not all of Miss Worthington's calibre,\
  \ however; they included Dr Moses Gaster, the eminent Hebraist, whose youngest daughter\
  \ was my contemporary at the Slade; Hugh Schonfield, whose scholarly preoccupations\
  \ did not prevent his founding later The Mondcivitan Republic; Dr W B Crow, Grand\
  \ Master of the Order of the Holy Wisdom and author and lecturer on Traditional\
  \ themes; Margaret L Woods, the Edwardian poet; Gerard Heym, the scholar and bibliophile,\
  \ and Edward Langford Garstin who was\_ secretary of the Society, his Alchemical\
  \ treatises, Theurgy and The Secret Fire, not yet published.\nThis is a peculiarly\
  \ British, or English, shabby-genteel world of the interwar years, suburban mystics\
  \ scraping by on invisible means, their secret wisdom unsuspected by their neighbours,\
  \ and often unintelligible even to their disciples. Later, Ithell Colquhoun is invited\
  \ to a weekend in the country:\nThe basic formula for such establishments is a simple\
  \ one: get hold of a large house and garden, also a biddable and industrious wife\
  \ and/or a selection of concubines with similar qualities; then collect disciples\
  \ of both sexes willing not only to pay for their keep but to work for it. (You\
  \ recommend work in house and garden for its therapeutic value, but it also saves\
  \ you the expense of employing staff.) The formula was used successfully for a number\
  \ of years early this century by \u2018Monsieur Gurdjieff\u2019 at Fontainebleau;\
  \ by Crowley (more briefly) at his Abbey of Thelema, Cefalu, in the early Nineteen-Twenties,\
  \ and by P D Ouspensky in the \u2018Thirties, when he occupied at least two different\
  \ properties in the Home Counties. To expand the cynical remark that \u2018behind\
  \ every Western teacher is a boarding-house or a brothel\u2019, I would put Meredith\
  \ [Starr] and Ouspensky into the first category; but if the reports of inmates are\
  \ exact, there were at least elements of the second chez MM Gurdjieff and Crowley.\n\
  She arrives at Frogmore on a chilly November day, met at the nearest station by\
  \ her host in a \u201Cbattered car\u201D.\nFrogmore proved to be a red-brick gabled\
  \ house set on sloping ground; the atmosphere of the demesne at once struck me as\
  \ gloomy, the interior no less so. The dining-hall was sombrely pannelled and almost\
  \ without illumination; we all sat at a long table with Meredith at the head. The\
  \ diet, strictly food-reform, was far from being the delicious fare vegetarian food\
  \ can and should be; I remember a tasteless soup with something like barley-kernels\
  \ in suspension, also whole cooked cabbage-leaves like dark linoleum. Why these\
  \ could not have been chopped up, seasoned, and served with an appetising sauce\
  \ I don't know\_: perhaps that would have destroyed their virtue?\nWriting in the\
  \ 1970s\u2014or, as she would put it, the Nineteen-Seventies\u2014Ithell Colquhoun\
  \ looks back and sees parallels with the present:\nMy room was cold, cramped and\
  \ shabby\_: when later I described it to Margot, \u2018Very simple\u2019, she murmured\
  \ with a far-away look. But is it simple when all water has to be carried, the lavatory\
  \ is a long way down a spooky corridor, and the only warmth comes from hot bottles?\
  \ Is an earth-closet in the garden that has to be emptied periodically really simpler\
  \ than main drainage? Or rather, does not the absence of mod. cons. make for less\
  \ simple household-running than if things were arranged with a little common sense?\
  \ I suspect that to-day some hippie-girls, after enthusiastically integrating themselves\
  \ with a commune, learn this same fact the hard way. Life may be simple for their\
  \ men if these do little but discuss what they call philosophy, but how about the\
  \ women? To keep even relatively warm, clean, and fed in primitive conditions is\
  \ more difficult than in \u2018squarer\u2019 surroundings. (Incidentally, how far\
  \ out-dated is much hippie ideology when it comes to considering women as human\
  \ beings! Or failing to consider them at all.)\nForty years on from this spot-on\
  \ observation of hippies, she still skewers, in a few simple sentences, the inanities\
  \ of those of our twenty-first century eco-warriors who would like nothing better\
  \ than to plunge us into a pre-industrial dark age.\nI realise I have quoted on\
  \ far beyond that startling opening paragraph, but doing so proves the point I suppose.\
  \ Read it, and you're hooked. I am fifty pages in, and am looking forward to the\
  \ rest of the book with immense glee.\n[2010-09-12]"
