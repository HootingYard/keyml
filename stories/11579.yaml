text: "My sister recently unearthed a trunk crammed with stuff from forty years ago,\
  \ when she moved to the United States. It had remained unopened since she moved\
  \ to her present address some thirty years ago. Within, among other things, she\
  \ found a notebook containing some early writings by Mr Key.\nHere is the beginning\
  \ of a piece called \u201C-En\u201D. I should point out that I have absolutely no\
  \ memory of it at all. The notebook is undated, but I would guess it to be from\
  \ the mid-1970s. That being so, it is no surprise to find it imbued with the earnest\
  \ seriousness of teenpersonhood, though I am pleased to note that it includes a\
  \ hint of the love of words for their own sake. Make of it what you will.\n(Click\
