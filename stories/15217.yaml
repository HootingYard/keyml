text: "I bashed my bonce upon a shelf, dislodging from it a tiny elf. It toppled down\
  \ on to the floor and scampered out through my front door. I followed it as best\
  \ I could, all the way into a wood. The wood was mostly larch and lime, and the\
  \ elf was bent on an awful crime. I watched as it picked a woodcutter's pocket.\
  \ As it ran away I tried to block it. Then I saw its face, the hideous elf. It looked\
  \ uncannily like Will Self. I fainted away in shock and fright, and when I awoke\
  \ it was deepest night. The woodcutter led me to a glade and gave me tea and marmalade.\
  \ I spooned it straight out from the jar, then we got into the woodcutter's car\
  \ and drove around in the pitch dark, thinking it would be a lark. But it was not\u2014\
  for we came a-cropper, and were arrested by a copper. He took us to the local nick,\
  \ where I began to feel quite sick. Locked in a cell, I bewailed my fate. Then the\
  \ elf came in, fair oozing hate. He bashed me on my bonce again, and then he turned\
  \ into a hen. Not any hen\u2014one with no head. And then I woke up in my bed. It\
  \ had all been a terrible dream occasioned by too much ice cream. So, tinies, make\
  \ sure you behave yourselves, or you'll be beset by hens and elves, by a headless\
  \ hen, and a terrible elf who looks exactly like Will Self.\n[2017-02-03]"
