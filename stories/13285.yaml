  \ (giving up again) Nothing to be done.\nVLADIMIR: (advancing with short, stiff\
  \ strides, legs wide apart) I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my\
  \ life I've tried to put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't\
  \ yet tried everything.\nESTRAGON\_: (interrupting) I invoke Sumai!\nEnter a big\
  \ band orchestra, crooners, chorus girls, dancers, acrobats, jugglers, clowns, etc,\
