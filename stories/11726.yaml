  \ of the Brazilian man killed by a cow falling through his roof.\nElsewhere, though\
  \ it is hardly \u201Cnews\u201D, we learn from a list of children detained in a\
  \ Worcestershire insane asylum between 1854 and 1900 that one poor little tot was\
  \ there because he or she was \u201Cfrightened by a cow\u201D. Whatever terrors\
  \ the cow may have provoked pale beside an entry further down the list, which tells\
  \ us that another mite was placed in the asylum after \u201Cbeing put inside a recently\
  \ killed pig\u201D. To which one can only respond with a blood-curdling \u201Ceek!\u201D\
