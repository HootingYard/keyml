text: "For me, the story that sums up Herzog's unique world-view concerns the great\
  \ German Jewish film critic Lotte Eisner, a concentration camp survivor and an early\
  \ champion of his work. Eisner had lived in Paris since the war, having fled to\
  \ France to escape the Nazis. In November 1974 Herzog was in Munich when he heard\
  \ that she was dying. \u2018German cinema could not do without her now,\u2019 he\
  \ declared. \u2018I set off on the most direct route to Paris, in full faith, believing\
  \ that she would stay alive if I came on foot.\u2019 For three weeks he walked through\
  \ rain and snow, without a proper map or winter clothing, trekking across muddy\
  \ fields, following a straight line on his compass. \u2018It was like a pilgrimage,\u2019\
  \ he says. \u2018I would not allow her to die.\u2019 When he arrived at her bedside,\
  \ Eisner was on the mend. \u2018Open the window,\u2019 he told her. \u2018From these\
  \ last days onward I can fly.\u2019\nfrom a review of The Werner Herzog Collection\
  \ (BFI) in The Spectator\n[2014-08-31]"
