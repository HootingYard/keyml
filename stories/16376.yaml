text: "The row between Twittery Corbynistas and the BBC over Jeremy Corbyn's hat\u2014\
  a row some have dubbed Hatgate \u2013 reminded me that during the late 1960s, at\
  \ the height of the Cold War, my father sported a Russian-style winter hat. This\
  \ led some neighbours on our council estate to surmise that my Pa was a Soviet spy.\
  \ The fact that he regularly popped in to the newsagent's to pick up a copy of the\
  \ Morning Star probably added to their suspicions. Unfortunately I don't have a\
  \ photograph, doctored or otherwise, of my father in his Communist headgear.\n\n\
  One of the amusing things about all the nitwit fans losing their marbles over supposed\
  \ BBC perfidy is that there must be thousands of photographs of Corbyn wearing self-styled\
  \ \u201Crevolutionary\u201D attire. Remember that the dear leader's politics are\
  \ still those of an earnest teenager circa 1968. Before becoming Labour leader,\
  \ he was regularly pictured wearing Leninist workers\u2019 caps or one of those\
  \ scarves the Palestinian death cult maniacs are so fond of.\nOK, now I'm off to\
  \ the political re-education camp to learn the errors of my ways.\n[2018-03-19]"
