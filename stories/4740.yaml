  AMBROSE, a bird\nAMBROSE\_: Bring me a jar of lemon curd!\nPLOPPO\_: (Aside) Can\
  \ such things be? A talking bird? (To Ambrose) Whyfore dost thou want lemon curd?\n\
  AMBROSE\_: Perchance this day my loins to gird.\nPLOPPO\_: I did not know that birds\
  \ have loins. However, if you give me some coins, I will go and buy a jar. There\
  \ is a curd shop not so far.\nAMBROSE\_: I beg thee, signor, use your own cash.\
  \ (Aside) Should I praise his fine moustache? (To Ploppo) Your moustache is really\
  \ great. Now hurry before it is too late!\nPLOPPO\_: Fear not, the curd shop never\
  \ shuts. But \u2013\nAMBROSE\_: But me no buts! Go and buy my lemon curd, or I shall\
  \ be a distraught bird.\nPLOPPO\_: (Aside) I loathe the prospect of a bird distraught.\
  \ It goes against everything I was taught. My parents put it very well\u2014\u201C\
  Be good to birds, or you'll go to hell.\u201D\nAMBROSE\_: (Aside) If I had hands,\
  \ I'd clap with glee. This signor fears upsetting me. His childhood guilt, it haunts\

  \ and runny.\nPLOPPO\_: Are you quite sure you have no money?\nAMBROSE\_: As sure\
  \ as eggs is eggs, signor. Now do not tarry anymore. Go to the shop and buy me curd,\
  \ or I shall be a loin-limp bird.\nPLOPPO\_: I will do as you ask and pay for your\
  \ snack.\nExit PLOPPO\nAMBROSE\_: The next scene is called \u201CWhen Birds Attack!\u201D\
