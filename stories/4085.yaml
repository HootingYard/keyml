text: "Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers were skulking along a corridor in a top secret\
  \ intelligence facility under cover of darkness when they heard, from a heavily\
  \ padlocked chamber, the unmistakeable sound of hissing.\n\u201CWhat do you suppose\
  \ that hissing sound is, Hiss?\u201D whispered Chambers, \u201CIt sounds like a\
  \ writhing tangle of asps.\u201D\n\u201CI very much doubt that it is the hissing\
  \ of asps, Chambers,\u201D replied Hiss, \u201CConsider where we are.\u201D\nWhittaker\
  \ Chambers looked perplexed.\n\u201CYou perplex me, Hiss,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  How can I know where we are when the entire point about the siting of this top secret\
  \ intelligence facility is that it is unmarked upon any map, and that to get here\
  \ we had to crawl through subterranean tunnels which twisted and turned in such\
  \ convolutions that all sense of direction, indeed all sense of mental balance,\
  \ is lost, and lost utterly?\u201D\nAlger Hiss smiled at his alleged friend, and\
  \ stooped to remove from the hollowed-out heel of his shoe a small mechanism, fitting\
  \ easily into the palm of his elegant hand, that looked much like a compass.\n\u201C\
  By heavens, Hiss!\u201D hissed Chambers, \u201CYou have a compass!\u201D\n\u201C\
  Not so, Chambers,\u201D replied Hiss, \u201CThis is in fact a miniature savage rotary\
  \ magnetic machine, akin to the one devised by Dr Henry Hall Sherwood of New York\
  \ but designed for quite a different purpose from his original.\u201D\nThe pair\
  \ were now directly outside the chamber door, and the hissing sound was louder,\
  \ and more hissy than ever.\n\u201CBrilliant, Hiss!\u201D whispered Chambers, \u201C\
  To use a magnetic machine of American design to help facilitate the ultimate overthrow\
  \ of the capitalist system. Stalin would approve such cunning. But what does it\
  \ tell us?\u201D\n\u201CWell, Chambers,\u201D said Hiss, \u201CNote the savagery\
  \ of its magnetism and rotation, which increases the closer we get to the door of\
  \ the chamber. If I am not mistaken, beyond that door is the bottomless viper-pit\
  \ of Gaar!\u201D\nWhittaker Chambers's eyes nearly popped out of his head.\n\u201C\
  The bottomless viper-pit of Gaar did you say, Hiss?\u201D he said.\n\u201CI did,\
  \ Chambers,\u201D said Hiss.\n\u201CB-b-but how in the name of Lenin\u2026?\u201D\
  \nAlger Hiss told his alleged friend that the time for explanations would come later.\
  \ For now, he said, it was enough that they had located the top secret bottomless\
  \ viper-pit. It was time to turn back, make their way through the twisty turny subterranean\
  \ tunnels, and meet up with their Soviet contact, in heavy disguise, at the cocktail\
  \ bar of a swish hotel. He stowed the savage rotary magnetic machine back in his\
  \ false heel, and, taking Whittaker Chambers by his shabbily-suited arm, led him\
  \ away from the mysterious door, behind which the hissing of untold numbers of vipers\
  \ continued, growing fainter and fainter as the duo skulked away along the corridor.\n\
