text: "One foul and thunderous day, Prince Fulgencio was much pained to learn that\
  \ there was, running amok in his castle, a reprehensible tot.\n\u201CWhence comes\
  \ this reprehensible tot?\u201D he asked the henchman who had brought him this news.\
  \ Prince Fulgencio hated all tots, infants, and tinies, with a hatred that burned\
  \ his black soul.\nThe henchman was ignorant of the provenance of the tot, but he\
  \ was rightly terrified of Prince Fulgencio's rages, so he made up a story about\
  \ the tot having been delivered to the castle in the talons of a fierce and gigantic\
  \ bird of prey. There were many holes in this tale, and it would not have stood\
  \ up to the merest scrutiny, but in his petulance and rage the Prince did not listen\
  \ to it carefully, and he accepted it without question.\n\u201CFind the tot and\
  \ throw it down the deepest well in my domain,\u201D roared the Prince, \u201CAnd\
  \ then find the bird of prey and trap it in a net!\u201D\nThe henchman wrote these\
  \ commands down in his henchpad, so he would not forget them, then clanked away\
  \ in his armour to one of the many pantries, where he joined other henchmen who\
  \ were carousing and glugging great flagons of fermented goaty milk and henbane.\
  \ Not long thereafter, all the henchmen were sprawled on the floor of the pantry\
  \ in a stupor, away with the fairies.\nMeanwhile, up in his chamber, Prince Fulgencio's\
  \ rage was unabated. So terrific was his temper that he began to see hallucinations,\
  \ not the least of which was the reprehensible tot itself, grown to an enormous\
  \ size, and banging a spoon against a bowl.\n\u201CI am at the end of my tether!\u201D\
  \ shrieked the Prince, \u201CI am become unhinged!\u201D\nIt was rare for Prince\
  \ Fulgencio to demonstrate such a level of self-awareness, though had he but paused\
  \ to consider the matter he would rapidly have apprehended that there were neither\
  \ tethers nor hinges about his person. On the contrary, he was dressed in his finery,\
  \ silks and satins and rich brocade, garish, bright as fire, brighter than the sun\
  \ which had not shone on his castle for years uncountable.\n\u201CI have no need\
  \ of sunlight,\u201D the Prince had said, in his calmer moments, \u201CFor I pour\
  \ forth my own princely effulgence, so dazzling it blinds all those who have the\
  \ temerity look upon my countenance.\u201D\nThis was of course a delusion, but there\
  \ was nobody in the castle who dared to tell Prince Fulgencio what was what. Nobody,\
  \ that is, save for the reprehensible tot, who now came scampering into the Prince's\
  \ chamber. It was much, much smaller than the phantom version born of the Prince's\
  \ visions, yet no less alarming. It was unkempt, and spotted with patches of milky\
  \ sick, and emitted a deafening keening.\n\u201CWhy are you not at the bottom of\
  \ a well?\u201D cried Prince Fulgencio.\nBut the reprehensible tot had not yet learned\
  \ to form coherent words. Gazing directly into the Prince's face, it screamed and\
  \ wailed, and then belched up another gobbet of sick.\nThe Prince called for his\
  \ henchmen, but they did not come, for they were still away with the fairies. And\
  \ it was those very same fairies, of course, not a bird of prey, which had delivered\
  \ the reprehensible tot to the castle, into the presence of the Prince. From that\
  \ day forth, the tot would cling to the Prince, like a witch's familiar, keening\
  \ into his ear and splattering him with sick, until, truly at the end of his tether\
  \ and truly unhinged, Prince Fulgencio gave up the ghost, and anointed the tot as\
  \ his dauphin, his son and heir, whereupon the tot of a sudden broke into human\
  \ speech, and called for the henchmen, and had Prince Fulgencio thrown down the\
  \ deepest well in his domain. For years uncountable, thereafter, peasants would\
  \ often see, circling over the well, a fierce and gigantic bird of prey which, when\
  \ peered at closely, dissolved into a shower of fairies, fairies stained with sick.\n\
