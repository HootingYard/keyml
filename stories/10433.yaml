text: "Thomas de Quincey said that tea was the favoured beverage of intellectuals.\
  \ I have made it my life's work to test every claim ever made by de Quincey, so\
  \ to this end I decided to gather a smattering of intellectuals and plop cups of\
  \ tea in front of them to see what would happen.\nIf de Quincey was right, each\
  \ intellectual would lift the cup to their lips and drink deep and thereafter emit\
  \ an \u201Caah!\u201D of satisfaction. At least one would say something along the\
  \ lines of \u201Cthere is nothing quite like a nice cup of tea\u201D.\nConversely,\
  \ if de Quincey was wrong, then the intellectuals would pick up the cups, pour the\
  \ tea into the gutter, and fill the now empty cups with hooch from a flask taken\
  \ from their pockets. They would then glug the hooch before emitting the same \u201C\
  aah!\u201D of satisfaction, this time accompanied by a belch of alcoholic fumes\
  \ strong enough to fell an ox.\nI was interested to see what would happen.\nBut\
  \ before distributing the cups of tea, I realised that I had to make absolutely\
  \ sure the persons I gathered, at the trestle table in the field under the viaduct,\
  \ were indeed intellectuals. My experiment would be hopelessly compromised if just\
  \ one of them was a dimwit or peasant or was otherwise unintellectual. My assistant,\
  \ Mungo, he of the hunchback and twisted face and slobber, had given me a very sensible\
  \ piece of advice.\n\u201CUurggh, Master!\u201D he had slobbered, the day before,\
  \ \u201CJust because someone has a beard and is French and bespectacled and gesticulates\
  \ wildly when speaking of things you do not understand is no guarantee that they\
  \ are an intellectual.\u201D\nI took this to heart. How easily the wool could have\
  \ been pulled over my eyes had I not listened to Mungo!\nIncidentally, in case you\
  \ were wondering, Mungo himself does not drink tea. His favoured beverage is brackish\
  \ water from a spigot, gulped from a battered tin beaker. But he does not claim\
  \ to be an intellectual. Quite the opposite. Mungo has often told me that he has\
  \ only half a brain, and that half befuddled. He is, however, absolutely invaluable\
  \ as an assistant, when I can persuade him to come down from the belfry where he\
  \ likes to cavort and lollop with his pet owls and bats and scorpions.\nMindful\
  \ of Mungo's advice, I went roaming the streets on the lookout for possible intellectuals.\
  \ At first I buttonholed anybody whose head resembled an egg. As I grabbed their\
  \ collars, I fired at each of these persons a question.\n\u201CAre you an intellectual?\u201D\
  \ I cried.\nIf they answered in the affirmative, I asked a supplementary question,\
  \ to wit; \u201CWhat abstruse theorem would you posit to account for the unconscionable\
  \ delay in the completion of the roadworks on the Blister Lane bypass?\u201D\nIf\
  \ the egghead claimed to be above such petty everyday concerns as roadworks, and\
  \ to never have even heard of Blister Lane, I dismissed them. A true intellectual,\
  \ I reasoned, while being above such petty everyday concerns as roadworks, and never\
  \ having even heard of Blister Lane, would nonetheless have an abstruse theorem\
  \ to posit, even though it might be utterly meaningless to a mere mortal such as\
  \ myself who knew the roadworks and the bypass and the delay like the back of his\
  \ hand.\nBy this tactic, I found it devilishly difficult to find a single intellectual.\
  \ My Thomas de Quincey tea experiment was unravelling before it had even begun!\
  \ I decided to broaden the scope of my search and to accost those persons whose\
  \ heads did not look much like eggs, though I stopped short of questioning anybody\
  \ whose head resembled a potato, for obvious reasons.\nThis was to be my undoing.\
  \ Seeing me approach various persons sashaying about the streets but pointedly ignoring\
  \ him, a man with a potato-shaped head lumbered towards me and cornered me in the\
  \ doorway of a butcher's shop.\n\u201COi!\u201D he said, \u201CYou are stopping\
  \ all sorts of people to ask if they are intellectuals, but you have pointedly ignored\
  \ me.\u201D\nI blathered some rubbish. He whacked me on the windpipe and bundled\
  \ me into the back of a van. He then drove off at speed.\nSome time later, the van\
  \ screeched to a halt. He dragged me out and, threatening me with his fist, commanded\
  \ me to follow him. He had parked at the edge of a forest, and it was into the dense\
  \ trees we now went. I was terrified, and wished Mungo were with me. But I had left\
  \ him in his belfry, brewing a large pot of tea.\nEventually my abductor and I arrived\
  \ at a clearing. There was a bonfire, around which sat a group of men each of whom\
  \ had a potato-head, some even more potatoey than the man who had brought me here.\
  \ One of these rogues looked up at me, and spoke.\n\u201CWelcome,\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201CWe are the woodland chapter of the Potato-Headed League of Acolytes of Alain\
  \ de Botton. A denser concentration of intellectuals you could not hope to find\
  \ for miles and miles hereabouts.\u201D\nAll I could say in reply was \u201CGosh!\u201D\
  \nI noted that they all had well-thumbed and heavily annotated copies of A Week\
  \ At The Airport (2009), the Swiss sage's book based on his stint as writer-in-residence\
  \ at Heathrow Airport and one of the decisive intellectual tours de force of the\
  \ past hundred years. If I needed any proof that these potato-heads were intellectuals,\
  \ here it was!\n\u201CPerhaps you'd care to join us for a nice cup of\u2014\u201D\
  \ said the leader. But I did not hear the last word, because at that moment a flock\
  \ of woodland birds began to shriek, deafeningly, from their perches in the trees.\n\
