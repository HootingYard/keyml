text: "Here is an (anonymous) review on Amazon of Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief\
  \ Lives:\nThis is a near-perfect example of a gift book that keeps on giving. Small\
  \ and appealing, with a well-organised, encyclopaedia-style layout and charming\
  \ portrait illustrations. The text is a delight\u2014easy to dip in and out of,\
  \ and full of facts that are perplexing, bizarre, amusing and sometimes poignant.\
  \ What really sets it apart, however, is Frank Key's unerring eye for the deliciously\
  \ obscure and his unique sense of humour, which runs like a seam of precious metal\
  \ through the book. An unexpected treasure.\nI need hardly remind you lot that you\
  \ are under instructions to buy copies of the book for everybody you know. While\
  \ you're about it, you should add your ha'ppenyworth to the online reviews at Amazon.\
  \ You know it makes sense.\n[2015-10-07]"
