text: "Call me slow-witted, if you will, but it took me an extraordinary length of\
  \ time to realise that the manger, away in which the little Lord Jesus lay down\
  \ his sweet head, was in fact a barnyard animal feeding trough. Yes, yes, I know\
  \ that the carol is quite explicit on this matter, pointing out that the holy infant\
  \ had \u201Cno crib for his bed\u201D, but somehow in my mind I have always associated\
  \ a manger with a newborn's sleep facility, rather than as what the OED calls \u201C\
  a long open box or trough in a stable, barn, etc., out of which horses and cattle\
  \ can eat fodder\u201D. You see what I mean about being slow-witted?\nAnyway, what\
  \ occurs to me are the immense repercussions had some roaming ravenous barnyard\
  \ omnivore fallen upon the manger and, understandably assuming its contents to be\
  \ dinner, gobbled up the little Lord Jesus. Two thousand and thirteen years of Christian\
  \ civilization would have been as naught. Imagine that, if you can.\nThough we might\
  \ further consider the possibility that the barnyard omnivore, having ingested the\
  \ Messiah, could itself have become the focus of religious yearnings. Let us assume\
  \ that Joseph and Mary, fine, responsible parents as they were, were distracted\
  \ by the arrival of shepherds and wise men and kings, and took their eyes off their\
  \ mewling infant just long enough for the ravenous beast to come clattering into\
  \ the farmyard building and guzzle the baby down.\nIncidentally, just as I was confused\
  \ about the precise nature of a manger, I was equally muddleheaded about the provenance\
  \ of the kings. I thought they were \u201Cwe three kings of Orion-Tar\u201D. I had\
  \ no idea where Orion-Tar might be\u2014though it sounded vaguely like a region\
  \ of outer space\u2014nor why it had three kings rather than, as is usual, just\
  \ the one, unless one is in Westeros, which has several. But the kings of Westeros\
  \ are continually at each other's throats, whereas the three kings of Orion-Tar\
  \ seem like boon companions, travelling together across the desert (or possibly\
  \ the Red Waste) following a star.\nAnyway, if we assume that Joseph and Mary and\
  \ the shepherds and the Magi and the three kings of Orion-Tar suddenly hear a great\
  \ gulping and belching sound from the ravenous omnivore, and turn to look, they\
  \ might very well want to make sure that the beast does not go running off. It might\
  \ be too late to save the little Lord Almighty, but the barnyard beast itself is\
  \ now clearly sacred. It contains within it the light of heaven and the hope of\
  \ all mankind.\nGoats are omnivorous, as far as I know, so let us say that it is\
  \ a goat that has swallowed the baby Jesus. It seems likely that, over the succeeding\
  \ two thousand and thirteen years, we would have devised a culture based upon a\
  \ goat-god. How different would our history be? It might be interesting to run the\
  \ permutations through a superdupercomputer, as long range weather forecasters and\
  \ climate change persons do. Or, more cheaply, one could create a board game, to\
  \ while away the starlit evenings, snuggled down in heaps of straw, in barnyards\
  \ far away.\n\n[2013-05-04]"
