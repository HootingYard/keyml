text: "\nPicture courtesy of The Victorian Era\nWhen ghouls attack, there are certain\
  \ precautions the sensible householder can take to avoid permanent disarrangement\
  \ of the senses. Ghouls will oft times take you into their chill embrace and drip\
  \ ghastly ectoplasm from their extremities. This can be such a disgusting experience\
  \ that your nerves will be bedizened before you even have time to shout \u201CAllahu\
  \ Akbar!\u201D or some similar appeal to a deity. Not that calling upon any god,\
  \ not even some of the Aztec ones, will do you much good with a ghoul on the attack.\
  \ By and large, ghouls are godless, and have no concept of spiritual fervour or\
  \ fear. Being semi-transparent and insubstantial, they are also, regrettably, impervious\
  \ to being beaten with shovels or fire-tongs. How, then, can you defend yourself\
  \ and your loved ones against their malign implacability?\nHere are some tips from\
  \ a pamphlet recently issued by the government's newly-appointed Ghoul Czar:\nA\
  \ flamboyant ping pong technique unnerves most ghouls. Practise relentlessly, even\
  \ on the Day of Rest.\nGhouls hate syrup. Keep plenty of tins in your pantry.\n\
  A lopsided cake-stand artfully placed on the dresser will throw a ghoul into a quandary.\n\
  If you have a pond, keep a pet swan.\nRecital of Sylvia Plath poems can send ghouls\
  \ back to the netherworld from which they emerged. But never, ever whisper a word\
  \ from the works of Ted Hughes in their presence.\nSlack-jawed farmhands can be\
  \ positioned between you and a ghoul to stave it off.\nIf you are staying in a ghoul-haunted\
  \ guest-house, insist on having a trapdoor in your room.\nSpray the air with essence\
  \ of toffee apple.\nOrnate stippled eider duck decor baffles the keenest ghoul.\n\
  An unctuous demeanour will behove you well.\nBear in mind that there is no known\
  \ defence against the Brechtian ghoul.\nLike racehorses, ghouls can be nobbled.\
  \ This prevents any mischief in the first place.\n[2009-10-30]"
