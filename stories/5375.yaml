text: "What is it about South Mimms? Further revelations from Strange Cults And Secret\
  \ Societies Of Modern London by Elliott O'Donnell (1934):\n\u201COn All Hallows\
  \ E'en certain members of the [Ghost] Circle were invited to meet, at eleven at\
  \ night, in secrecy, at cross-roads not far from South Mimms. All turned up, the\
  \ founder, as usual, arriving first, and on the neighbouring clock striking midnight,\
  \ they were surprised to see a herd of pigs trotting down the road towards them,\
  \ road and pigs gleaming white in the moonbeams. Never had any of the members of\
  \ the Ghost Circle seen such pigs! They seemed to be positively gigantic, but thin.\
  \ On they came, perfectly noiselessly, and on arriving at the cross-roads, they\
  \ passed through a gateway into a field, leaving in their wake a current of icy\
  \ air. There was something so strange and eerie about them that several members\
  \ of the Ghost Circle, overcoming a certain reluctance, ran to the gate to have\
  \ another look at them. The field, which afforded no cover of any kind, was very\
  \ large, and it was empty, save for cattle. The pigs had inexplicably vanished.\n\
  \u201CThe members of the Circle learned subsequently that the cross-roads were known\
  \ to be haunted by a herd of phantom pigs, but only on All Hallows E'en.\u201D\n\
  I think at the end of this month the Hooting Yard Phantom Pig Spotting Club should\
  \ convene at that cross-roads in South Mimms. Be there or be square, as the hepcats\
  \ used to say, half a century ago, daddy-o!\n[2010-10-07]"
