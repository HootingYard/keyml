text: "\nThis picture shows the mezzotintist Rex Tint, as a child, painting a portrait\
  \ of his sister Dot Tint, chronicler of vampiric sea shanties and much else besides.\
  \ Rex had great pretensions, in his curdled youth, to becoming a painter of note,\
  \ rather than a mezzotintist, and he executed innumerable daubs, of which the portrait\
  \ of Dot is but one. Several art critics have tugged at their beards and fiddled\
  \ with their hornrimmed spectacles as they struggle to understand why Rex Tint abandoned\
  \ paint and set out on the path to mezzotinty glory. Now the tale can be told. Well,\
  \ not \u201Ccan be\u201D but \u201Chas been\u201D, in Pebblehead's latest bestselling\
  \ paperback How The Secret Police Confiscated Rex Tint's Paintbox And How He Sobbed\
  \ And Whimpered Until A Kindly Butcher's Shop Assistant Gave Him A Secondhand Mezzotinting\
  \ Kit. Annoyingly, the prize-winning paperbackist does not tell us the reason why\
  \ the secret police targeted the tiny painter. Had he perhaps daubed a less than\
  \ flattering portrait of Prince Fulgencio? Or, on one of his plein air excursions,\
  \ had he unwittingly painted a top secret experimental brain-incapacitating nerve\
  \ gas facility? It really would help if Pebblehead could do some proper research\
  \ for a change, but I expect he is too busy bashing out his next bestseller on that\
  \ antique typewriter of his, looking up occasionally at the picture of Anthony Burgess\
  \ drawingpinned to his cork board and pretending it is a mirror.\n\_\n[2008-11-02]"
