text: "In the bulging sack of letters I received in response to the piece On Pickles\
  \ And Pluck And Gumption, one particular missive struck me. \u201CA lesser man would\
  \ of course plunge the syringe directly into the flesh of the subject,\u201D wrote\
  \ a reader. There is some truth in this, though only a smidgen. Some would argue\
  \ that a smidgen of truth is better than no truth at all, and they may well be right,\
  \ but what my correspondent overlooks is that if one did plunge the syringe filled\
  \ with essence of gumption and pluck directly into the subject, thus obviating any\
  \ need for the pickles in the first place, what on earth would one do with all those\
  \ pickles, and indeed with the jars into which they are crammed? The obvious rejoinder\
  \ to this is \u201COffer them for sale, unmodified, at the church bazaar or f\xEA\
  te\u201D. This is a superficially attractive suggestion, one that might be leapt\
  \ upon by the credulous, the dimwitted, or the poor. Those of us bounden to the\
  \ glorious idea of pickles-with-a-purpose will disagree.\n[2012-03-12]"
