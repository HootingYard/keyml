text: "At the risk of this becoming a muffincentric website, I think it is important\
  \ that readers are given the fruits of Glyn Webster's tireless\u2014if no doubt\
  \ tiring\u2014researches into what the OED defines as a small, flat, cake made from\
  \ yeast batter and cooked on a hotplate, usually eaten split, toasted, and spread\
  \ with butter, jam, etc., esp. for breakfast or tea. Interestingly, in the dictionary's\
  \ first citation, from 1703, it is spelled Moofin, and in the second, from 1747,\
  \ Muffing (capitalisation in the originals). I wonder if it is too late to beat\
  \ against the tides of history and to reintroduce one or other of these spellings?\n\
  Anyway, the only reason I have returned to this possibly inexhaustible topic is\
  \ that, having apprised himself of the difference between true Moofins and what\
  \ the rest of the world outside Britain think is a Muffing, Mr Webster has kindly\
  \ provided these cut-out \u201Cpatches\u201D or \u201Cplug-ins\u201D for your heraldic\
  \ muffin device. Just print, snip, \u2018n\u2019 gum!\n\n\_\n[2009-03-09]"
