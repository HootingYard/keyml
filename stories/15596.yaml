text: "I was at a loose end, staring out of the window looking at crows, and my mind\
  \ turned to Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves. With a start, I realised how little\
  \ I knew about them. As luck would have it, the very next day at a rummage sale\
  \ I picked up a copy of a privately-printed pamphlet by Knud Padde, described on\
  \ the title page as a Lecturer in Arabian Thievery Studies at the University of\
  \ Ack-on-the-Vug, or possibly the University of Vug-on-the-Ack. Here is his list\
  \ of the Forty Thieves, together with \u201Cpreliminary notes\u201D on each thief.\n\
  Corky\u2014a hireling thief, a chump, a talc-powdered wastrel.\nMutcho\u2014greasy,\
  \ vindictive, base.\nIbster\u2014looms terrible in dreams, licks ice cream cones.\n\
  Guff\u2014the boffin of the gang, and sniper, and Tippi Hedren's penpal,\nSpoors\u2014\
  great galumphing fool, Oppidan, thimble-fumbler.\nWaxy\u2014waxy.\nGeraldo\u2014\
  of monstrous girth, of lively demeanour, of hand-stitched tunics.\nCarsten\u2014\
  polishes off raisins, swigs tap water, goes shod in clogs.\nFang\u2014inhabits palatial\
  \ apartments with his wolf and his minuets.\nSudbury\u2014exists on a higher plane,\
  \ thumps things, distressed.\nOswin\u2014suffers fools gladly, hung out to dry.\n\
  Bantock\u2014dustpan and brush man, Hotspur, clackety rhythm.\nMort\u2014hedger,\
  \ was a water-bailiff, albino.\nChippy\u2014wanting eggs.\nHardcastle\u2014fevered\
  \ brow, distorted spine, curly ringlets.\nAptod\u2014when first he flew he blundered\
  \ into branches of dark trees.\nShopworn\u2014lacks the common touch, hoist by petards,\
  \ a darling.\nUrbane\u2014urbane yet ditzy, polka-dotted, ruminant.\nDobbin\u2014\
  pumped gas back in Montana, unbridled savagery, lacks depth.\nInky\u2014several\
  \ contradictory reports, buff-coloured envelope, chalk dust.\nHig\u2014shallow,\
  \ potted, wet.\nAnglepoise\u2014Jesuit upbringing, weather station, tarred with\
  \ broad brush.\nSnapper\u2014bolt upright, sprained ankles, Maoist.\nBoomer\u2014\
  booming voice, bloody nose, best before dusk.\nChepstow\u2014owls nest in his hair,\
  \ he plays the piccolo, he eats mashed potato.\nZigzoo\u2014champs at bits, stinks\
  \ of Jarlsberger, often with conifers.\nDelmore\u2014lurid, spiteful, mechanical.\n\
  Esher\u2014flabby, subject to fits, member of Tuesday Weld Fan Club.\nJetboy\u2014\
  likely to be found upon rotating things in park playgrounds.\nCasement\u2014proudly\
  \ lumpen, secretly engaged to a flapper, podcaster.\nUck\u2014abnormal alignment\
  \ of head upon neck, neck grubby, hair unwashed.\nFig\u2014a stone's throw from\
  \ the sea, green about the gills, hot to trot.\nStraubenzee\u2014sings the songs\
  \ his mother taught him in that Darmstadt nursery.\nFogbound\u2014clatters to and\
  \ fro, goes haywire, made of cement.\nWailywaily\u2014hidden behind shutters, brilliantine\
  \ in his hair, indiscreet.\nBurgess\u2014over by the ice rink, underneath the arches,\
  \ powered by batteries.\nMudguard\u2014guards mud.\nPepinstow\u2014thunderous hooves,\
  \ brilliant plumage, exquisite table manners.\nDixon\u2014marimba, clutching at\
  \ straws, gin slings and blood oranges.\nQuangocrat\u2014double helpings of sausage-shaped\
  \ dough snacks.\nThis is a slightly revised version of a piece which originally\
  \ appeared in 2011.\n[2017-09-02]"
