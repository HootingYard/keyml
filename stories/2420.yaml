text: "Alan Bristow, whose obituary appears in today's Guardian, was clearly quite\
  \ a character. Here was a man who once threw Douglas Bader into a swimming pool\
  \ (pity it wasn't a pond, I sighed) and called him a \u201Ctin-legged git\u201D\
  . I was particularly struck by one little detail, maddeningly not expanded upon,\
  \ one of those asides that have you clamouring for more information.\nBristow survived\
  \ into old age to die at 85, just a decade after licensing for production a patent\
  \ \u201Cwater bed\u201D for cows\u2026\nWhat? What what what? It is sometimes said\
  \ that Hooting Yard is \u201Codd\u201D or \u201Cwacky\u201D, but the \u201Creal\
  \ world\u201D is infinitely more strange.\n[2009-05-05]"
