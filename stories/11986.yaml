text: "\nI was delighted, the other day, to become reacquainted with my collection\
  \ of the Puffin Post magazine, which I had not clapped eyes on since the last century.\
  \ Launched in 1967 by Puffin Books editrix Kaye Webb (ex-wife, incidentally, of\
  \ Ronald Searle), Puffin Post was a quarterly magazine for bookish tinies. My collection\
  \ comprises the fourth and final issue of Volume One, and Volumes Two to Four complete,\
  \ thus thirteen issues in total. I have been taking my time in browsing through\
  \ them, savouring the memories they summon.\nIt occurred to me to transcribe certain\
  \ choice items for the edification, instruction, and amusement of you lot, and I\
  \ thought I had found the perfect item to start with when, in that very first issue,\
  \ I came upon a story entitled The Potato With BIG Ideas. We take our potatoes seriously\
  \ at Hooting Yard, as you know. Alas, the tale\u2014by Alf Proysen, author of Little\
  \ Old Mrs Pepperpot\u2014turned out to be rather humdrum. It is certainly not a\
  \ patch on the potato-based yarn drawn to my attention by Salim Fadhley, A Potato\
  \ That Wasn't A Christian. One cannot help thinking that the authors of potato stories\
  \ for children have a very weak grasp of the nature of actual potatoes. I would\
  \ bet there is not a potato on the planet which (a) has ideas of any kind, or (b)\
  \ is a confessor of any of the major religious faiths. And remember, I have studied\
  \ potatoes intensely, so I should know.\n\nAnyway, back to the Puffin Post. In Volume\
  \ 2, No. 2, I did find what I was looking for, an absolutely rip-roaring story by\
  \ Janet Aichison (age 5 and a half) entitled The Pirate's Tale. It bears comparison\
  \ with some of Bertolt Brecht's early piratical short stories. Here it is:\nOnce\
  \ upon a time there were some bad pirates. They sailed to a mountain. They dug in\
  \ the mountain and found gold and silver. The mountain was a volcano.\nThey saw\
  \ a bit of volcano then they ran back to their ship and they sailed away to their\
  \ mountain and hid the gold and silver in their cave and guarded the treasure. A\
  \ dwarf stole the gold and silver. The pirates woke up and killed the dwarf. The\
  \ pirates got the gold and silver and the dwarf's gold and silver.\nThe king dwarf\
  \ sent an army to fight the pirates and to hurt the pirates. Who knows which side\
  \ won the battle? The pirates! The pirates caught the king dwarf and they killed\
  \ him and they threw him into the sea. A whale threw him up again and the pirates\
  \ threw him down again. A shark came along and ate him up. The pirates laughed to\
  \ see the dwarf being eaten up by the shark.\nOne day the pirates found a crab.\
  \ It pinched a pirate. The pirates screamed to see the crab. The pirates ran away\
  \ to the ship and sailed to the mountain and got the guns and killed the crab and\
  \ the pirates laughed.\nOne day the pirates found a rat and killed it. The pirates\
  \ had a cat and the cat ate the rat and the cat died. The pirates looked sad. A\
  \ pirate found a house and opened the door and went in. It was dusty. He tidied\
  \ it and dusted it. The pirate found a mouse and gave the mouse a piece of cheese.\
  \ The cheese was magic.\nThe pirate said \u201COh dear. The cheese is magic. I shouldn't\
  \ have given the mouse the cheese.\u201D The mouse died.\nOne day the pirates found\
  \ a forest. The forest was bewitched. The pirates went in the forest. The pirates\
  \ turned into frogs and leapt about all over the place and croaked, trying to talk.\n\
  One day the pirates found some children. The pirates kept the children for their\
  \ wives to cook for them. The wives cook nice things for the pirates. The pirates\
  \ liked the food and ate it all up. The pirates liked the fish best. They caught\
  \ the fish themselves from the sea.\nOne day the pirates weren't very well. The\
  \ pirates had mumps. They were very ill. One day the pirates got better and sailed\
  \ away to the mountain and saw a shark and killed it and the pirates\u2019 new cat\
  \ said, \u201Cmeow meow\u201D. The pirates said, \u201CBe quiet, new cat.\u201D\n\
  One day the pirates found a ship. The ship had some gold and silver. The pirates\
  \ stole the gold and silver. The gold and silver is magic.\nThe pirates died. The\
  \ cat died.\nA work of some genius, I think. In the unlikely event that the now\
  \ middle-aged Janet Aichison chances to read this, I hope she will leave a comment.\n\
