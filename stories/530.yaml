text: "When consulting propulsion tables, it is extremely important that you know\
  \ exactly what you are looking at. This is all the more so since there are two different\
  \ sets of propulsion tables in circulation, the popular Bl\xF6tzmann Propulsion\
  \ Tables and the somewhat arcane Non-Bl\xF6tzmann Propulsion Tables. Both sets are\
  \ widely available, either as booklets or as loose-leaf plastic sheets which can\
  \ be propped on a little hands-free propulsion table-holding tripod. Of course,\
  \ both the Bl\xF6tzmann and Non-Bl\xF6tzmann tables give pretty much the same results,\
  \ depending on the precise nature of your experiment, and even some of our most\
  \ top-drawer propulsionists have gone on record to say that they do not give two\
  \ pins which set of propulsion tables they use. But there is slightly more to it\
  \ than that.\nIt is hardly surprising that Bl\xF6tzmann himself execrated the Non-Bl\xF6\
  tzmann tables in rather fruity language. I would quote him directly, were it not\
  \ that my upbringing makes me prefer the thought of throwing myself into the path\
  \ of a speeding train rather than uttering some of the fruitier words in Bl\xF6\
  tzmann's lexicon. Sheltered it may have been, and riddled with priests, but I make\
  \ no apologies for the way I was brought up. Yes, I may blush when I read language\
  \ like that spat from the mouth of Bl\xF6tzmann, but that does not make me a bad\
  \ person, merely, I would aver, one who does not wish to be sullied and besmirched.\
  \ The Bl\xF6tzmanns of this world may scoff at one of my refined sensibilities,\
  \ and god knows they do, but I shall not waver. That is why I will not repeat the\
  \ verbal abuse Bl\xF6tzmann poured down upon the begetter of the Non-Bl\xF6tzmann\
  \ Propulsion Tables. You will just have to take my word that he condemned them absolutely.\n\
  Given the popularity and effectiveness of Bl\xF6tzmann's own propulsion tables in\
  \ calculating all kinds of propulsiony matters, it is common to find people asking\
  \ why the Non-Bl\xF6tzmann set was ever devised in the first place. Oh, I don't\
  \ mean that you will be asked such a question while waiting at a bus stop or trudging\
  \ along the high street or when you pop into the newsagent to buy a packet of cheap\
  \ Lithuanian cigarettes. But at any gathering of propulsionists, for example at\
  \ a cocktail party held to celebrate the publication in an important academic journal\
  \ of a new paper on a knotty propulsion problem, or in the queue for the toilets\
  \ at an award ceremony for a propulsionist who has won a ribbon or a medal, you\
  \ can bet that someone present will pipe up with the old question of why on earth\
  \ the Non-Bl\xF6tzmann Propulsion Tables were not only created, but published in\
  \ great quantities, in innumerable editions and formats, and often included a picture\
  \ of Bl\xF6tzmann on the cover which was deliberately scribbled upon or otherwise\
  \ defaced. It is as if he is some kind of Stalin figure, wielding limitless power,\
  \ who must be deposed for the greater good. Perhaps there is an element of truth\
  \ in this. After all, Bl\xF6tzmann was a commanding figure in the world of propulsion,\
  \ with a deafeningly loud voice, the constitution of a bison, and a tendency, at\
  \ conferences, to wear dazzling suits dotted with badges made from semi-precious\
  \ metals. He had a curious way of carrying himself, such that even when sprawled\
  \ half-asleep in a chaise longue, his belly full of cognac, he looked as if he was\
  \ standing upon a plinth, gazing into a brighter future. And of course, since his\
  \ death in that unfortunate picnicking accident, statues of him have sprung up wherever\
  \ one looks, or at least wherever one looks in propulsionist circles, and it cannot\
  \ be denied that a sort of personality cult has arisen in his wake.\nIt is also\
  \ true that the person or persons who devised the Non-Bl\xF6tzmann Propulsion Tables\
  \ remain, to this day, completely anonymous. I had hoped, when I sat down to write\
  \ this article, to reveal to the world their identity. Then we could at least refer,\
  \ along with the Bl\xF6tzmann Propulsion Tables, to, say, the Huffington or Widdecombe\
  \ or Blunkett-Blears Propulsion Tables, instead of having to use that frankly irritating\
  \ Non-Bl\xF6tzmann formulation. It saddens me, immeasurably so, that I cannot make\
  \ good on my intention. I have, you see, been \u201Cgot at\u201D, by dark and sinister\
  \ forces within the propulsionist community. Tomorrow morning at dawn I begin work\
  \ in the salt mines. It will, I suppose, be something of a novelty to give lectures\
  \ on propulsion to salt miners as they hack away with their picks and shovels, although\
  \ I am fearful that the language deployed by salt miners is a sight more fruity\
  \ than the language used by Bl\xF6tzmann in his denunciation of the Non-Bl\xF6tzmann\
  \ Propulsion Tables. Wise, I think, to pack a pair of earplugs in my pippy bag,\
  \ to protect my delicate sensibilities, for which, I repeat, I refuse to apologise.\n\
