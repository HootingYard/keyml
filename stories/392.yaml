text: "Bring Forth, Devil, Your Elks is the title of a history of hunting in Finland\
  \ noted in the latest issue of the splendidly-named periodical Books From Finland\
  \ (reviewed here).\nInterestingly, the out of print pamphleteer Dobson once planned\
  \ a series of bestiaries for children to which he gave almost identical titles.\
  \ They included Bring Forth, Devil, Your Moose, Bring Forth, Devil, Your Stormy\
  \ Petrels, and Bring Forth, Devil, Your Common House Flies. Unlike the Finnish volume,\
  \ none of Dobson's works ever saw the light of day, for he abandoned the writing\
  \ of them when it was pointed out to him that he could make more money by churning\
  \ out a potboiler about decorative cardigan buttons, a subject on which he was an\
  \ acknowledged expert.\nUnfortunately, a glut of decorative cardigan button books\
  \ appeared on the market just as Dobson was finishing his manuscript. His money-making\
  \ scheme shattered, the pamphleteer was forced to take a job as janitor at an evaporated\
  \ milk factory. As we now know, this experience was pivotal in his pamphleteering\
  \ career.\nFurther Reading\_: \u201CDobson's Pivotal Experience As A Janitor At\
