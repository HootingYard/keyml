text: "\nIt is fortunate that your own dear Mr Key is such a level-headed fellow,\
  \ or I might begin to suffer from delusions of L Ron Hubbarddom. Notwithstanding\
  \ the enduring popularity of the hideous bat god Fatso, it seems that the Goat God\
  \ Catechism has captured the imagination of the masses\u2014or, if not quite the\
  \ masses, then at least of two American podcasters.\nFirst, the catechism was given\
  \ a fine treatment by golden-voiced Norm Sherman at the Drabblecast. Now it has\
  \ been picked up by one Walter O'Hara. Mr O'Hara's podcast is called Airy Persiflage,\
  \ and with a title like that we can assume he is a man of impeccable taste. Indeed,\
  \ he has also essayed a reading of some twaddle I wrote about venomous serpents.\n\
  The striking thing about this new version of the Goat God Catechism is Mr O'Hara's\
  \ inspired decision to have a child read the responses. The child in question is\
  \ \u201Cyoung Gar\u201D, who lends a splendid piquancy to the piece. I wonder if\
  \ young Gar hails from the awful, spooky land of Gaar, that place of nightmares\
  \ and ill-advised picnics?\n[2011-01-15]"
