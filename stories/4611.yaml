text: "\nThis is Hadrian Beverland (c.1651\u20131716), accompanied by \u201Ca wanton\
  \ woman\u201D. Beverland was a theologian of sorts and a classical scholar of great\
  \ erudition. His book detailing the sexual abnormalities of the ancient world was\
  \ described as \u201Cabominable and scandalous\u201D and \u201Can abortion from\
  \ depraved brains\u201D by the authorities of Leyden University, and he was banished\
  \ from Holland. He spent much of the rest of his life in London and is buried in\
  \ the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden.\nHe made various attempts to gain\
  \ permission to return to his homeland, and when these failed he developed a persecution\
  \ mania to which he gave vent in a series of pamphlets. These take the form of letters\
  \ to him from the fictitious Perin de Vago, together with Beverland's responses.\
  \ Beverland was particularly exercised by a certain Tempest, \u201Cthat curst flatterer\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cprophanest Reprobat\u201D who \u201Ctried to make a Tennissball of a\
  \ Foreigner\u201D. Tempest sent \u201CGirrls into the Fiels, who with a wanton eye\
  \ could move olds mens entrails\u201D and \u201CWensches with Linnen Oisters and\
  \ Orang Appels who breathe life into Deathmen\u201D. \u201CAlackaday,\u201D he complained,\
  \ \u201Conly for loaking fresh in a frosty evening you must be suspected to be a\
  \ Deboche.\u201D Others apart from \u201Cthe Gnat Tempest\u201D were scheming against\
  \ him, and \u201CIf the Mystery of the Plot lies hidden in the bottom of Hell, it\
  \ will not only be difficult to draw it out of the Dunghill, but also dangerous\
  \ to disturb the Dragons, Snakes and Hornets. Let them Lices who suk their livelyhood\
  \ out of our carcass glorys in their guile. You avoid their Companye.\u201D\nTowards\
  \ the end of his life Beverland prepared a catalogue of his collection of paintings\
  \ for sale, in which he included this verse:\n(The Song of the Borts of pray,) I\
  \ have no Wife / The Devil Upon Two Crutches / Chear! Chear! / Hier / Carry me to\
  \ Hell. / I do not know my L. where Hell is: But if it may please your L. I carry\
  \ you to the Devil. / Go unto the Devil Tavern. / What upon Crutches! / I am very\
  \ Old, if it may please your L. / No Old Devil can please me. Have you no younger\
  \ Devils in Hell? / Yes, Long Brown, who carries little Davits upon his Shoulders:\
  \ / What is become of little Gibson?\n[2010-06-14]"
