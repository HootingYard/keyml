text: "Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us readers\
  \ a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that Olympics\
  \ logo. Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial conclave,\
  \ and to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed Blunkettite.\
  \ The real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate to find out what\
  \ Mrs Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?\nWell, Ruth, yes I can! A few weeks\
  \ ago, the octogenarian crone was approached by a charity working with the filthy\
  \ and destitute denizens of that cluster of hovels out Pointy Town way. As you may\
  \ know, these ill-starred wretches are even lower than the lowest of the low, wallowing\
  \ in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking even the most basic sanitation. Other charitable\
  \ organisations shun them because, you know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins\
  \ was asked to knit something for them, and she wisely decided to bring a little\
  \ joy to their hearts\u2014if they actually have beating human hearts\u2014by making\
  \ for them a life-size knitted puppet of Ugo, hero of a series of exciting Bulgarian\
  \ folk tales.\nWe have published a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so\
  \ this would be an opportune time to pluck them from the Archive and present all\
  \ six here afresh, some three years after they originally appeared:\nUgo Goofs Off\n\
  Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. \u201CThere you go, Ugo, goofing\
  \ off again,\u201D said Ugo's ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got\
  \ it on his boots. \u201CMa, I've got goo on my boots,\u201D said Ugo. Ugo's ma\
  \ gave him a rag to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws\
  \ and rags. Ugo's ma was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots,\
  \ she opened the drawer of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather\
  \ than a gewgaw, for if she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn't get the goo off his boots,\
  \ but with a rag he would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the\
  \ goo off his boots with a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.\nUgo's Pal Ulf\nIn Plovdiv,\
  \ Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. \u201CLook at my bubo, Ugo,\u201D\
  \ said Ulf. \u201COooh!\u201D said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His\
  \ ma made him a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf's\
  \ bubo. In the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo's\
  \ ma brought food for Ulf. \u201CHave some pancakes, Ulf,\u201D said Ugo. Ulf gobbled\
  \ a pancake. \u201CFar be it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201C\
  But you should put the pancake on your bubo, like a poultice.\u201D \u201COh,\u201D\
  \ said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon his bubo was gone. But Ugo still had the flu,\
  \ so his ma was thrown for a loop. She could cure the plague but not the flu, and\
  \ did not know what else she could do. For the time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.\n\
  Ugo's Pod\nIn the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo's ma\
  \ said, \u201CUgo, why are you using a pod instead of a jar?\u201D Ugo's ma was\
  \ blind, but she knew that the plop of Ugo's pod was different to the plop of his\
  \ jar. \u201COh, ma,\u201D said Ugo, \u201CMy jar is in the shed.\u201D Ugo's ma\
  \ bashed Ugo on the head. \u201CNever leave your jar in the shed, Ugo,\u201D she\
  \ said, \u201CWhen you do I will bash you on the head, as I just did.\u201D Ugo\
  \ said, \u201CSorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed.\u201D \u201CAh,\u201D\
  \ said Ugo's ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.\nUgo's\
  \ New Hooter\nBack in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his\
  \ hooter in his blind ma's ear. \u201COoh, Ugo,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CThat\
  \ hooter makes a din!\u201D \u201CIt's a hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize,\u201D\
  \ said Ugo. \u201CAnd what did your pal Ulf win, Ugo?\u201D asked Ugo's ma, shelling\
  \ peas as she spoke. \u201CUlf won a toy wolf, ma,\u201D said Ugo, \u201CIt's as\
  \ noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb on its tum,\
  \ the toy wolf that Ulf won roars.\u201D Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran off\
  \ to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.\nUgo Turns\
  \ Blue\nIt was Saint Hector's Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo's hood got snagged\
  \ on a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. \u201COooo\u201D\
  \ said Ugo's pal Ulf, \u201CUgo, you look all blue.\u201D \u201CAck\u201D said Ugo.\
  \ \u201CI'll go and fetch your blind ma, Ugo, to see what she can do,\u201D said\
  \ Ulf, though he could have pulled Ugo's hood off the tack on which it was snagged.\
  \ But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found Ugo's ma sitting on a stool. \u201C\
  Ugo's ma,\u201D said Ulf, \u201CUgo has turned blue. His hood is snagged on a tack.\u201D\
  \ Ugo's ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool and ran to Ugo, who\
  \ was indeed very blue. Ugo's ma spat out her chew, and it landed in a pot of glue.\
  \ It was the glue Ugo's pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo's ma unsnagged Ugo's hood\
  \ from the tack. \u201CAck\u201D said Ugo. \u201COoo, Ugo's ma, I knew you would\
  \ know what to do,\u201D said Ulf. Ugo's ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon,\
  \ and confiscated his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass.\
  \ At Saint Hector's Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.\nUgo Goes Loopy\nOne\
  \ morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the yard\
  \ and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard, Ugo's blind\
  \ ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started to sound\
  \ like a goose. \u201COoo,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CWhat am I to do? A shrew and\
  \ a goose!\u201D Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. \u201CWow!\u201D said Ugo's\
  \ pal Ulf, who came tumbling into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was\
  \ loopy too. \u201CIs that you, Ugo's pal Ulf?\u201D asked Ugo's ma. \u201CWoo woo\
  \ woo,\u201D said Ulf. \u201CUlf, there is a shrew and a goose and a cow in my yard,\u201D\
  \ said Ugo's ma. \u201CNo, Ugo's ma,\u201D said Ulf, \u201CIt's only Ugo being loopy.\u201D\
  \ \u201CAh,\u201D said Ugo's ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo's pal Ulf off to school.\
  \ On a tram. In Plovdiv.\n[2007-06-06]"
