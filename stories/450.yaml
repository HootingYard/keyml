text: "The global merchandising arm of the Hooting Yard franchise, always keenly aware\
  \ of what passes for the zeitgeist, will shortly be launching upon a delighted public\
  \ its latest product. Years of ruinously expensive research come to fruition with\
  \ the appearance in a shop near you of the Malevolent Homunculus Action Figure.\n\
  \nDeceptively innocent-looking, this tiny homunculus-sized homunculus is actually\
  \ a model of a particularly evil homunculus, one which can be sent out on nocturnal\
  \ escapades to terrorise one's unsuspecting neighbours. Although not as minuscule\
  \ as the homunculus favoured by spermist theoreticians, it is still remarkably small,\
  \ about the size of a newborn squirrel. It has moveable arms and legs, a fully rotating\
  \ head, and a well-ironed shirt the better to conceal its inherent malevolence.\
  \ Package also includes a scenic backdrop, made of sturdy cardboard, of \u201Cthose\
  \ pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing\u201D from Brief\
  \ Encounter (David Lean, 1945) against which the malevolent homunculus can be posed,\
  \ spookily.\n[2008-06-24]"
