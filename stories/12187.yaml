text: "And so our tenth anniversary celebrations come to an end with a piece from\
  \ earlier this year\u2014Monday 28 January to be precise\u2014purporting to be a\
  \ diary entry by Captain Nitty from 1954. Here's to another decade of Hooting Yard!\
  \ And a merry Christmas to you lot!\n\nLast night it was my turn on duty for the\
  \ nocturnal pig watch. Brandishing my Alpenstock, I set out across the tarputa as\
  \ night came crashing down. Some say it is an affectation of mine to use a Swiss\
  \ stick designed for mountainous terrain when crossing the flat wild bleak desolate\
  \ windswept tarputa. Perhaps it is, but I never leave home without my Alpenstock\
  \ these days. Some say, also, \u201CWhy are there no twilights any more, no dusks?\u201D\
  , and it is true that nowadays day turns to night in a seeming instant. I cannot\
  \ account for this, so I do not try to. Conjecture would prove fruitless, I fear,\
  \ and would make no difference. The fact is, as I grasped hold of my Alpenstock\
  \ and opened the door, there was daylight, and then I stepped out, and as I pulled\
  \ the door shut behind me, so it was night.\nNight\u2014the time when we must keep\
  \ watch for pigs. It has not always been so. Years ago, if you can believe it, there\
  \ was not even a Nocturnal Pig Observatory on the tarputa. Apparently, people used\
  \ to just turn down the lights in their huts and chalets and lie down in their beds\
  \ and sleep untroubled sleep. It is hard to credit, is it not? Yet it was so. Where\
  \ the Nocturnal Pig Observatory now stands, \u201Ca triumph of filigree in cement\u201D\
  \ as it has been described, was nothing more than a stretch of flat wild bleak desolate\
  \ windswept tarputa, identical to the flat wild bleak desolate windswept tarputa\
  \ surrounding it on all sides as far as the eye can bear to see.\nHammering on the\
  \ door with my Alpenstock, I summoned the duty pig observer whose shift was at an\
  \ end. He handed me the cap and the dockets and flips and flaps and scrippies, unfurled\
  \ his umbrella, and headed out across the night-black tarputa. I settled myself\
  \ at the console and adjusted the pig scanner. There was a pong from the oil heater\
  \ but at least I was warm. Outside the wind was howling and the stars were quivering\
  \ in the heavens. I thought of Beerpint's poem \u201CWobbly Stars\u201D.\nAnd so\
  \ I gazed. I gazed, now at the monitors, now out through the reinforced plexiglass\
  \ pigproof window. I saw no pigs. It was a small mercy. But we must snatch at small\
  \ mercies, and coddle them close, and cherish them. For not all nights are pigless,\
  \ on the flat wild bleak desolate windswept tarputa.\n[2013-12-24]"
