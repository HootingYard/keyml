text: "The Heft Of Dough is the title of an LP recorded towards the end of the last\
  \ century by Agnetha and Anna-Frid and Benny and Bjorn (alphabetical order). The\
  \ Scandinavian foursome were joined on this occasion by virtuoso glockenspielist\
  \ Dot Tint, who until then was better known as the accompanist of an oompah band\
  \ devoted to masterpieces of the Baroque. Dot was introduced to Agnetha, Anna-Frid\
  \ et al, by her brother Rex Tint, the mezzotintist, who had been commissioned by\
  \ either Benny or Bjorn to create a mezzotint for the cover of an earlier LP by\
  \ the quartet. Temperamental Rex completed the work but, in a characteristic fit\
  \ of hysterics, destroyed it before it could be used, alleging that it failed to\
  \ meet the exacting standards he set himself. This is unlikely to be true, and those\
  \ in the know suggest it was simply yet another unreasonable tantrum by the talented\
  \ but tiresome mezzotintist.\nHis sister possessed a more equable demeanour, and\
  \ the recording sessions for The Heft Of Dough were notable for their almost uncanny\
  \ calm. Granted, Benny went postal one afternoon when Anna-Frid sang her lines tapioca\
  \ rather than, as the score required, marmalade, and he threatened to tear her throat\
  \ out, but it was only that, a threat, and he was quickly persuaded to go and take\
  \ a nap. It was Dot Tint who did the persuading, and it was upon Dot Tint's divan\
  \ that he napped. Dot took her divan everywhere, for she was overfond of naps herself.\
  \ Some said her calmness was closer to narcolepsy, and I suppose it is true that\
  \ she only ever seemed fully awake when bashing beauty from her glockenspiel.\n\
  Press interest in the sessions was intense. Agnetha and Anna-Frid and Benny and\
  \ Bjorn had recently had a hit single with the prize-winning, insanely catchy song\
  \ Lepanto, the lyrics of which cleverly use the 1571 Battle of Lepanto between the\
  \ Holy League and the Ottoman Empire as a metaphor for the more obvious pop pap\
  \ theme of romantic love. To keep intrusive hacks off limits, all approaches to\
  \ the recording studios were baited with baffles, made of cement. These served a\
  \ secondary purpose of deterring Rex Tint from barging his way in. The insufferable\
  \ mezzotintist declared that he had \u201Cunfinished business\u201D with Benny,\
  \ or possibly with Bjorn, and was set on disrupting the recording of the LP. Frustrated\
  \ by the baffles, he took to stalking the streets of the nearest township, cursing\
  \ and jabbering, until distracted at last by a fresh commission for a set of mezzotints,\
  \ though this was a ruse contrived by his sister Dot to lure him even further away\
  \ from the studio. By the time Rex Tint discovered he had been fooled, he was holed\
  \ up in a chalet on the other side of the globe while Agnetha and Anna-Frid and\
  \ Benny and Bjorn and Dot Tint were putting the finishing touches to their LP.\n\
  The Heft Of Dough is a concept album in which the fivesome use the heft of a ball\
  \ of dough as a symbol for various historical attempts to measure the weight of\
  \ the human soul. Perhaps the best-known of these are the experiments carried out\
  \ in the early years of the twentieth century by Duncan MacDougall, attending physician\
  \ at Grove Hall Consumptives\u2019 Home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. MacDougall\
  \ used an ornate, oversized Fairbanks scale, designed for weighing commercial silk,\
  \ to weigh his consumptive patients immediately before and after death, reasoning\
  \ that any perceptible weight loss must be accounted for by the departure of the\
  \ heaven-, or hell-, or purgatory-bound soul of the deceased. MacDougall was following\
  \ the lead of the seventeenth century Paduan physiologist Sanctorius, the founding\
  \ father of metabolic balance studies, who coined the term \u201Cinsensible perspiration\u201D\
  . One has to admire the manner in which Anna-Frid et al address this material in\
  \ a deceptively light pop pap format, with Dot Tint's frantic glockenspieling adding\
  \ a frisson of frantic glockenspieling.\nThe critics were not kind, however, The\
  \ Heft Of Dough being almost unanimously dismissed as a work of pretentious twaddle.\
  \ One of the most savage reviews of all was penned by Rex Tint, under an anagrammatic\
  \ pseudonym. After it appeared, in the weekly magazine Mezzotintists Turn Their\
  \ Hands To Writing Record Reviews, and she swiftly unravelled the anagram, Dot Tint\
  \ refused to speak to her brother for a decade. Curiously, Bjorn, or it may have\
  \ been Benny, was more forgiving, and he and Rex Tint renewed their friendship and\
  \ thereafter spent many a tenebrous Scandinavian dusk sitting together on the rim\
  \ of a fjord, swathed in coats of rabbit fur, drinking hooch and babbling into the\
  \ night.\n[2007-11-17]"
