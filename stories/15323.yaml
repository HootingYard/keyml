text: "I am old enough to remember\u2014albeit dimly\u2014the Latin Mass. For younger\
  \ readers, and non-Catholics, I should explain that until the mid-1960s, throughout\
  \ the Catholic church, Mass was conducted exclusively in Latin. The priest would\
  \ deliver the liturgy in Latin, and the congregation, when required to voice responses,\
  \ would do likewise. The change to the use of the vernacular came about when Pope\
  \ John XXIII instituted various liberalising reforms. There remain a few recalcitrant\
  \ diehards\u2014notable among them being the father of Mad Max star Melvin Gibson\u2014\
  who cling to the Latin Mass, although I understand this is much disapproved of by\
  \ the Vatican, and may even be illegal.\nOn the council estate where I grew up,\
  \ there were many Catholics but no Catholic church. To save us from having to trudge\
  \ a fair distance to St Bede's, the parish church, an arrangement had been made\
  \ that a pub on the estate would host our Sunday Mass. Thus every week we would\
  \ troop into the Moby Dick on Whalebone Lane. We used the main bar area of the pub,\
  \ with chairs temporarily aligned in rows, though I cannot recall what served as\
  \ an altar. I do remember that towels were draped over all the beer pumps at the\
  \ bar. After Mass, a goodly proportion of the congregation, and probably the priest\
  \ too, would remain in the pub waiting for opening time. My parents were not drinkers,\
  \ though, so we were herded home.\n\nAround the same time as the introduction of\
  \ the Mass in English, the service itself was moved to a new community centre on\
  \ the estate. Thus passed a particular, and in retrospect profound, part of my childhood.\n\
  I stopped attending Mass when, as a nincompoop teenager, I turned my back on the\
  \ faith. Then, and for many years afterwards, if I thought about the Latin Mass\
  \ at all, it was as a prime example of the stupidity of religion. How preposterous,\
  \ for people to gather together to listen and respond to what for most of them (and\
  \ certainly for the infant me) was a babble of incomprehensible gibberish!\nIt is\
  \ only recently that I have realised the significance of this early experience.\
  \ One must bear in mind that for the vast majority of people, there was nothing\
  \ remotely swinging about the 1960s. Particularly on my council estate, it was a\
  \ dull, pinched, grey (or beige) time yet to emerge from the austerity of the immediate\
  \ post-war years. We had no television, telephone, refrigerator, central heating,\
  \ or other home comforts. Life was uneventful and devoid of any but the most paltry\
  \ excitements. (I now look back with nostalgia for the peace and tranquility.)\n\
  There was thus something quite magical and passing strange about those Sunday mornings.\
  \ We gathered in the gloom of the pub, while a man dressed\u2014improbably\u2014\
  in often colourfully embroidered raiment stood, with his back to us (as the priests\
  \ did in those days), intoning a litany of words, and always exactly the same words,\
  \ which we did not understand, and bore no relation to anything we heard elsewhere,\
  \ in any circumstances. Indeed there was nothing about it that had anything whatsoever\
  \ to do with the world we inhabited the rest of the time. It was baffling and bizarre,\
  \ but, by dint of weekly repetition, comfortingly familiar. And it was deeply, deeply\
  \ serious.\nIt has now dawned on me, at long last, that, in my own faltering yet\
  \ determined way, I have been trying to recreate this numinous childhood experience\
  \ by babbling, once a week, in Hooting Yard On The Air on ResonanceFM.\n[2017-03-03]"
