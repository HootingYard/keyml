text: "Let us nip back to the seventeenth century, to the village of Britling, and\
  \ watch Fly Debate Roberts in action. Roberts, you will recall from your assiduous\
  \ reading of Hooting Yard postages yesterday, was a screamer in a preaching-barrel.\
  \ At least, that is how he was portrayed in the pamphlet A Word To Fanatics, Puritans\
  \ and Sectaries; or, New Preachers New (1641).\nThough he took naturally to screaming,\
  \ especially when it was his turn in the barrel, Roberts won his nickname by dint\
  \ of his great skill in debate, specifically in debate with flies. Every Thursday,\
  \ he would commandeer a big barn in Britling, and coax and cajole the villagers\
  \ to gather therein. Given the squalor and misery and sheer drudgery of life in\
  \ Britling at that time, most people were only too willing to attend. There was\
  \ certainly no lack of flies to challenge in debate, for what with all the rustic\
  \ filth and muck and rot Britling was rife with flies. Roberts was particularly\
  \ given to debating with blow-flies, and, once the villagers had settled and the\
  \ hubbub had died down, he would select one particular blow-fly among those infesting\
  \ the barn. The topic of debate was invariably an abstruse point of theology, of\
  \ which the following is a typical example:\nThat this barn agrees with the motion\
  \ that Man is made in the image of God, whereas the blow-fly is an emissary of Beelzebub.\n\
  Roberts would then harangue the fly for more than an hour, his voice rising to screaming\
  \ pitch so that the dimwits and noodleheads in the audience, of whom of course there\
  \ were many, could be forgiven for thinking they were attending, not a debate, but\
  \ one of his screamings from the preaching-barrel. Wiser heads noted the absence\
  \ of the barrel, and the presence of the fly. At the end of his tirade, Roberts\
  \ invited the fly to respond. Being a fly, of course, and incapable of human speech,\
  \ it remained silent, save for the irritating buzzing noise it made as it darted\
  \ hither and thither, haphazardly, within the barn. Roberts claimed this as a victory\
  \ and proposed that the fly be put to death, as the loser in the debate and as a\
  \ representative of the Devil. The villagers, provoked into a frenzy by his words,\
  \ formed a fearsome throng, leaping and cavorting around the barn armed with sticks\
  \ and pebbles and rolled-up pamphlets, trying to swat and slaughter the fly. Often\
  \ they were too stupid to recognise the individual fly Roberts had selected for\
  \ debate, and swiped at the nearest tiny airborne speck.\nSeventeenth century flies,\
  \ including the blow-fly, were almost identical to modern flies, and it would take\
  \ an extremely learned entomologist to spot the minimal differences between them.\
  \ I'm not an entomologist myself, so I am unable to pinpoint what tiny evolutionary\
  \ changes may have occurred in the past four hundred years, if any. But one thing\
  \ we all know about flies is that they move much, much faster than humans. If we\
  \ can for a moment imagine ourselves inside a fly's head, it is easy to picture\
  \ that a crowd of seventeenth century peasants, bent on our murder, and pursuing\
  \ us within the confines of a barn, will appear as if in slow motion. We have plenty\
  \ of time, as we watch a villager lumbering towards us, armed with a small agricultural\
  \ hand-tool, simply to flit out of the danger zone. Even as the peasant is swinging\
  \ his arm with deadly intent, we have zoomed over to the other end of the barn and\
  \ are happily regurgitating viscous goo onto a toothsome rotting morsel. If you\
  \ have difficulty seeing this in your mind's eye, I recommend you watch The Fly\
  \ (David Cronenberg, 1986) in which Jeff Goldblum illustrates precisely what I am\
  \ talking about.\nFly Debate Roberts himself, apparently, declined to take part\
  \ in the attempted fly-slaughter. He was, as a preacher, a man of words, or rather\
  \ screams, not a man of action. It was enough for him to know that he had provoked\
  \ the villagers into a murderous, and Godly, frenzy. He slipped out of a side door\
  \ of the barn and spent the rest of Thursday with his fellow Britlingite screamer,\
  \ Be Faithful Joiner, probably engaged in a bit of cooperage. Those preaching-barrels\
  \ were subject to much wear and tear, and needed proper care and maintenance.\n\
  At some point it must have struck Roberts that Thursday after Thursday, the number\
  \ of flies in the barn never seemed to get any smaller. We do not know if he actually\
  \ bothered to do a count, and he was never on hand to witness the peasants\u2019\
  \ killing frenzy, so he had no idea of their success or lack of it. What was plain,\
  \ however, was that the emissaries of Beelzebub were far from being eradicated.\
  \ It was then that he devised his fly-tether.\nThe Roberts Fly-Tether was basically\
  \ little more than a thin piece of string, looped at both ends. One loop was attached\
  \ to a nail hammered into an upright post in the barn. Shortly before the start\
  \ of the Thursday debate, Be Faithful Joiner, who was quick with his hands, would\
  \ pluck a blow-fly out of the air, and tie the other loop around one of its tiny\
  \ legs. The fly would then have to squat on the post, unable to go buzzing and darting\
  \ around the barn. This made the debates far more exciting, as even the densest\
  \ and most brainless of the villagers could work out exactly which fly Roberts was\
  \ challenging. They no longer had to cast their eyes around, foolishly, causing\
  \ giddiness. Use of the fly-tether also changed the manner in which the debates\
  \ ended. The fly's silence was no longer met with a scene of violent if pointless\
  \ havoc. Instead, Fly Debate Roberts himself, having called for the death of the\
  \ fly, would take a huge iron hammer and crush his opponent beneath it with a single\
  \ mighty, righteous, Godly blow.\nIn the next part of this series we shall take\
  \ a look at More Fruit Fowler of East Hadley. Fowler accumulated more fruit than\
  \ anyone before or since. But what did he do with it all? That is the question we\
  \ hope to answer.\n\nA blow-fly, losing a debate with Fly Debate Roberts\n[2012-06-18]"
