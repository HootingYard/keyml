text: 'The riverbank of which I speak was inhabited by glamorous moles. There were
  dozens of them, each more glamorous than the last, and the one who engages our attention
  on this damp Wednesday is the most glamorous mole of all. Her name is Hortense.
  Before you start complaining about the regrettable practice of anthropomorphising
  riverbank creatures, please bear in mind that not a jot of that is going on here.
  The mole was called Hortense and she was extremely glamorous. She wore a sort of
  mole version of a cloche hat, but there was nothing remotely human about her. She
  was just a mole, albeit one so glamorous that other moles swooned in her presence.
  Have you ever seen a mole swoon? It is quite a sight, and you will do well to have
  your camera at the ready. On the Wednesday of which I speak, there were many swooning
  moles to be seen by the riverbank. And we have not even begun to explore the marshes!

  Out in the spooky marshes, at dead of night, nothing stirred. Nothing except tiny
  nocturnal creatures whose habitat was marsh and fen. Cock an ear and you might hear
  scrabblings and scurryings, fugitive wisps of sound in the otherwise eerie silence.
  There you sit in your concrete pillbox, a primed grenade in one hand and a mug of
  tomato soup in the other. The dampness of your socks is most distressing. You are
  distressed by the dampness of your socks, in the marshes, in the night, but why
  are you holding a hand grenade? Is this wartime? Surely in wartime you would not
  be fobbed off with damp socks? A bat appears near your head, and you flinch. These
  marshes are known for their colonies of bats. Wisely, you sip your soup. It is piping
  hot. The air around the marshes is not.
