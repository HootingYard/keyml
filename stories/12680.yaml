text: "I have just read The Wilder Shores Of Marx by Anthony Daniels, a 1991 book\
  \ subtitled Journeys In A Vanishing World. Daniels\u2014better-known by the pseudonym\
  \ he has latterly adopted, Theodore Dalrymple\u2014sensing in 1989 that communism\
  \ was on the verge of collapse, and \u201Clong fascinated by the passing of ways\
  \ of life\u201D, travelled to five countries \u201Cwhose leaders refused to read\
  \ the writing on the wall\u201D\u2014Albania, North Korea, Rumania, Vietnam, and\
  \ Cuba. (The Ceausescu regime fell about a week after his visit.)\nIt's a splendid\
  \ book, as one would expect from a man who keeps alive that curious tradition of\
  \ medical doctors who are also accomplished writers. I was particularly pleased\
  \ to learn that the Albanian town of Fier had a twice-weekly newspaper entitled\
  \ The Sweat Of The Peasant.\nOf necessity, Daniels had to travel as part of an organised\
  \ group, and he is very good on the type of wide-eyed western lefties who were the\
  \ majority on such trips:\nI cast my eye over my companions of the next twelve days.\
  \ I had hoped for a rich crop of eccentrics among them, such as I had encountered\
  \ at the annual general meeting of the Anglo-Albanian Society in London a month\
  \ previously. The secretary of the society was a retired optician from Ilford who\
  \ had discovered the Balkan paradise late in life and learned its language; the\
  \ rank and file of the society seemed either elderly revolutionaries of the upper\
  \ classes, who knew the key to world history yet somehow had never learnt how to\
  \ do up their shirt buttons properly, or lonely, embittered proletarian autodidacts,\
  \ who dreamed of vengeance upon the world and called it love of humanity.\nWhile\
  \ in Albania he visited the Enver Hoxha Museum in the Boulevard of Martyrs in Tirana.\
  \ There is a display of the condolences received from all over the world following\
  \ Hoxha's death, and one of them is from our old pal Hardial Bains, First Secretary\
  \ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) of Canada and\
  \ the man who wrote song-lyrics for Cornelius Cardew:\nThe path which has been proven\
  \ to be invincible by the life and work of Comrade Enver Hoxha, who led his party\
  \ and people in their most militant and uncompromising struggle against imperialism,\
  \ social imperialism, the bourgeoisie and all reaction and revisionism and opportunism\
  \ of all hues in their service and who has left an indelible mark on history.\n\
  Cardew devotees will note that Bains used some of the exact same wording in the\
  \ song There Is Only One Lie, There Is Only One Truth. It says something for the\
  \ genius of Cardew\u2014who may or may not have been able to do up his shirt buttons\
  \ properly\u2014that his setting of such twaddle is both moving and beautiful.\n\
