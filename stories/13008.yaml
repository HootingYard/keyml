text: "[Thanks again to R.]\nThere is a song on Hex Enduction Hour, the 1982 album\
  \ by The Fall, entitled \u201CHip Priest\u201D. It was a great favourite of the\
  \ Phosphorescent Family, particularly of Old Pappy Phosph, who, in a certain light,\
  \ from a certain angle, on certain days of the week, at certain times of day, bore\
  \ a passing resemblance to Mark E. Smith, through a glass darkly.\nOne evening at\
  \ a family singsong around the phosphorescent fireplace, Old Pappy struck up an\
  \ a capella version of \u201CHip Priest\u201D. Now it had not escaped the notice\
  \ of tiny Mopsa Phosph that, when listening to a tape loop of distant pig gruntings,\
  \ one of her sisters had keened and wailed that she wanted a pig of her own, and\
  \ the very next day Old Pappy abducted one for her. (See The Family Pig for further\
  \ details.) So Mopsa in turn keened and wailed that she wanted a hip priest, then\
  \ burst into tears.\nBut as Old Pappy began to make reassuring cooing noises, and\
  \ seemed on the verge of promising that he would abduct a hip priest for her, Old\
  \ Ma Phosph put her foot down.\n\u201CWe will have no Papists in this family compound!\u201D\
  \ she cried. In common with about two thirds of the Phosphorescent Family, Old Ma\
  \ was a devout Zoroastrian. But Mopsa had a cunning beyond her years, and immediately\
  \ revised her keening.\n\u201CI want a hip magus! I want a hip magus!\u201D she\
  \ screeched, until Old Pappy becalmed her by promising to stride out across the\
  \ fields first thing in the morning and abduct one for her.\nThen two of tiny Mopsa's\
  \ tiny sisters piped up, demanding that they be given hip magi too. Old Pappy, who\
  \ remembered his Bible stories, thought it reasonable that magi should come in threes.\n\
  \u201CDon't you worry, girlies,\u201D he said soothingly, \u201CTomorrow morning\
  \ I will abduct three hip magi and bring them back to the compound. We can keep\
  \ them in one of the outbuildings next to the phosphorescent fence.\u201D\nAnd Old\
  \ Pappy was as good as his word.\nUnfortunately, within a few days the Phosphorescent\
  \ Family were much disconcerted by the activities of their hip magi, who did a lot\
  \ of shouting and waving of banners and placards outwith the outbuilding. It soon\
  \ became apparent that they were lefty hip magi, forever banging on about the iniquities\
  \ of the Americans and the Zionists and prescribing infantile and witless solutions\
  \ to social and economic issues. Old Ma Phosph, in particular, was none too pleased.\
  \ She was, after all, a Fascist as well as a Zoroastrian.\n\u201CThe hip magi will\
  \ have to go,\u201D she announced, \u201CIf they are not shouting and protesting\
  \ they sit around in their armchairs reading Chomsky and John Pilge. Old Grampy\
  \ Phosph must be turning in his grave to see such things happening within the family\
  \ compound he built with his bare phosphorescent hands!\u201D\nSo Old Pappy and\
  \ Old Ma took Mopsa and her sisters aside, and explained to them, very patiently\
  \ and tenderly, that the hip magi would have to go. There were tears, of course,\
  \ and keening and wailing, but then Old Pappy had a brainwave.\n\u201CI tell you\
  \ what, girlies! We can have a great deal of fun running the hip magi off our property,\
  \ pursuing them across the fields with pitchforks and blazing torches and trapping\
  \ them in Loopy Copse, where I have already dug a pit to chuck them into. And then,\
  \ as a special treat, I will go and abduct Mark E. Smith of The Fall, and we will\
  \ keep him in the outbuilding! You can feed him on the scraps left over by Baptiste\
  \ the Family Pig. What do you think of that?\u201D\nAnd the tiny Phosphorescent\
  \ girls whooped cries of delight and skipped and gambolled off across the lawn.\
  \ Peace settled once more upon the Phosphorescent family compound, and the filthy\
  \ magpie swooped down to perch on Old Ma Phosph's pippybonnet.\n[2014-08-13]"
