text: "You are all familiar, I assume, with the phrase \u201CBless his (or her, or\
  \ its) cotton socks\u201D, sometimes given as \u201CBless his (or her, or its) little\
  \ cotton socks\u201D. But I wonder how many of you are aware of the ceremonial rite\
  \ from whence it originates? Well, because I care about these things, and do not\
  \ wish to see you plunged in ignorant darkness, I am going to tell you.\nThe Blessing\
  \ of the Cotton Socks (only very rarely given as the Blessing of the Little Cotton\
  \ Socks) is almost as old as the wearing of cotton socks by persons of all ages\
  \ and stations in life. It is well to remember that for most of human history, not\
  \ only were no cotton socks worn, but no socks at all. Oh, our ancestors wrapped\
  \ various materials around their tootsies to keep them warm, but even in relatively\
  \ recent times, when civilization was pretty far advanced, the sock as we know it,\
  \ if it was worn at all, would have been made of rough, prickly, scratchy fabric.\
  \ Now I do not wish to career pell mell into a history of textiles and costumes\
  \ and cloth manufacture and so forth, for the simple reason that, were I to do so,\
  \ I would betray my unfathomable ignorance of such matters, and you would mock me,\
  \ and call me a fool, just as, admittedly in a different context, Ian Anderson of\
  \ Jethro Tull called the person who was kissed by a witch one night in the wood\
  \ a fool. Mr Anderson had his reasons, and so would you, so it is best if we avert\
  \ the possibility of you feeling it necessary to call me a fool. Let us just accept\
  \ that the ceremonial rite known as the Blessing of the Cotton Socks came into being\
  \ shortly after it became common for cotton socks to be worn, by humans.\nNow, I\
  \ realise how easy it would be for me to pull the wool over your eyes and make up\
  \ a ceremony. That might even be what you expect me to do. I could cobble together\
  \ some farrago of twaddle, littered with little details that make it seem convincing,\
  \ and you would go away happy, or happyish, or, I don't know, possibly not happy\
  \ at all, rather dejected and downcast and brimming with black bile. I always have\
  \ to bear that possibility in mind. Don't think for a moment that I simply tippy-tap\
  \ this stuff out, endlessly, day after day, for no apparent purpose, without giving\
  \ careful thought\u2014very careful thought\u2014to my readership, even if, upon\
  \ reflection, I have absolutely no idea who most of you are. Upon further reflection,\
  \ I realise it is perhaps reckless of me to make the assumption, as I did in the\
  \ very first words of this piece, that you are familiar with the phrases \u201C\
  Bless his (or her, or its) cotton socks\u201D or \u201CBless his (or her, or its)\
  \ little cotton socks\u201D. For all I know, you may never have heard the words\
  \ before. Well, you will almost certainly have heard the words, but perhaps not\
  \ in that precise order. Individually, yes, broken up, in separate contexts, I am\
  \ as sure as eggs is eggs you will have come across all those words. But hearing\
  \ them, or reading them, in isolation, snipped or chopped out of the phrase, is\
  \ not the same thing at all as hearing, or reading the phrase. Let me put them in\
  \ alphabetical order and you will grasp what I am driving at.\nBless. Cotton. Her.\
  \ His. Its. (Little.) Socks.\nI placed parentheses around \u201CLittle\u201D because,\
  \ in common usage, the phrase is equally valid with or without it. I suppose I could\
  \ have done the same with \u201Chis\u201D and \u201Cher\u201D and \u201Cits\u201D\
  \ because they are alternate choices, depending on whose (or what's) cotton socks\
  \ are being blessed. One would only use more than one of them if more than one person's\
  \ (or thing's) cotton socks were being blessed, for example if there were to be\
  \ a double blessing, of the cotton socks of, say, a boy and, say, a girl, but in\
  \ that case one is more likely to say \u201CBless their (little) cotton socks\u201D\
  , rather than the somewhat clunky \u201CBless his and her (little) cotton socks\u201D\
  \ or \u201CBless his (little) cotton socks and her (little) cotton socks\u201D.\n\
  Ah. I say \u201CAh\u201D because, in speech, \u201CAh\u201D often precedes the blessing.\
  \ Interestingly, \u201CAh\u201D also comes at the beginning if we rearrange the\
  \ words of the blessing in alphabetical order, as above. Well, it is perhaps not\
  \ that interesting. Christ, what a palaver.\nAll these reflections have made me\
  \ realise, better late than never, that I would be wasting your time, and mine,\
  \ by scribbling some drivel about the\u2014entirely genuine\u2014ceremonial rite\
  \ of the blessing of cotton socks. Of far more interest, it seems to me, is a related\
  \ blessing, the one adverted to in the title of Jefferson Airplane's 1969 live album\
  \ Bless Its Pointed Little Head. Though even then, the \u201Cit\u201D referred to\
  \ was a being whose tootsies were ensconced in (little) cotton socks, or so I am\
  \ told by my sources, who shall remain nameless, and wholly unblessed.\n[2012-02-01]"
