text: "With my head still buried in tales by M P Shiel, I find myself wondering if\
  \ our author was haunted by the spirit of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Rather like that\
  \ wonderful game Cheese or Font?, one could ask, of certain short passages, Shiel\
  \ or Hopkins?\nConsider the emboldened patch of this sentence, from the apocalyptically\
  \ bonkers Shiel story Vaila:\n\u201CAs he lifted a latch the metal flew inward with\
  \ instant impetuosity and swung him far, while a blast of the storm, braying and\
  \ booming through the aperture with buccal and reboant bravura, caught and pinned\
  \ me against an angle of the wall.\u201D\n[2010-11-16]"
