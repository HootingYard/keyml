text: "\u201CThe folklore of the plant is meagre, considering its wide distribution,\
  \ but there are a number of curious superstitions connected with it. In some parts\
  \ there is a belief that it thrives best if planted on Maundy Thursday; in others,\
  \ that if planted under certain stars it will become watery. In Devonshire the people\
  \ believe that the potato is a certain cure for the toothache\u2014not taken internally,\
  \ but carried about in the pocket. It is by several writers mentioned as a reputed\
  \ cure for rheumatism in the same way; only it is prescribed that, in order to be\
  \ an effective cure in such cases, the potato should be stolen. Mr. Andrew Lang\
  \ mentions an instance of faith in the practice of this cure, which he came across\
  \ in a London drawing-room. He regards this belief as a survival of the old superstitions\
  \ about mandrake, and as analogous to the habit of African tribes who wear roots\
  \ round the neck as protection against wild animals.\u201D\nBenjamin Taylor, Storyology\_\
  : Essays In Folk-Lore, Sea-Lore, And Plant-Lore (1900)\nADDENDUM\_: It may be worth\
  \ noting here that, if you were suffering from rheumatism in Aveyron, and, in attempting\
  \ a cure, stole a potato from the Wild Boy of that place, he would begin to scream.\
  \ Not unlike a mandrake root pulled from the soil.\n[2010-02-09]"
