text: "When they were apart, they questioned and instructed each other minutely on\
  \ the state of their health. \u201CHow is it my darling,\u201D Mill inquired, \u201C\
  that you say you have broken the habit of expectoration? When you cough are you\
  \ not obliged to swallow something if you do not spit it up?\u201D \u201CI cannot\
  \ but think,\u201D replied Harriet with her characteristic note of self-righteousness,\
  \ \u201Cthat if you tried as earnestly as I have done since October to avoid any\
  \ expectoration that you would lose the habit altogether as I have done.\u201D It\
  \ was her idea that Mill was bothered by phlegm because he was in the habit of spitting,\
  \ not that he was forced to spit because he was bothered by phlegm. Perhaps she\
  \ was right.\nJohn Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor recalled in Parallel Lives\_:\
