text: "I stumbled upon an old notebook. It is undated, but I think it was written\
  \ in the first years of the 1980s. Here are a few scribblings, of possible historical\
  \ interest. Despite severe temptation, I haven't changed a single word. As far as\
  \ I recall, these pieces have never until now been dragged out from under their\
  \ bushel*.\nI fed bears. I fed crows. One of them pecked my nose. I ate curry. I\
  \ ate meat. I slobbered and stamped my feet. I grew muscles. I grew fangs. My heart\
  \ burst with violent pangs. I wanted to be back at home, reading about the fall\
  \ of Rome, sitting in a chair in the drawing-room, watching from the window the\
  \ gathering gloom, eating potatoes, peas and pork, slicing them neatly with a knife\
  \ and fork, being very graceful, and being polite, going to the park to fly my kite.\
  \ Life had such charms when I was young, before I began to wallow in dung, before\
  \ I left for a life in the muck. All I can say is I've had good luck.\nI am a lighthouse\
  \ keeper. My name is Jim. It is a lonely life. Games on baize are my great love,\
  \ and ball games using sticks. Ah, I treasure memories of billiards and hockey as\
  \ the waves crash on the rocks.\nLet me tell you where I've been. This time I'll\
  \ make it a blue-ish land. A blue land and a big one. I went there on my horse.\
  \ I'll tell you all about that place, and how my horse fell sick there. Only the\
  \ sky was really blue. Everything was the same as here too. There were lupins, and\
  \ cupcakes, butter, clatter and taxes. It was a lovely land, so cool. I'm a tourist\
  \ wherever I get to.\nLast time I saw you I came to your hut. You'd decorated the\
  \ walls with stolen paint. I arrived with a warrant for your arrest. You had lockjaw.\
  \ I punched your head. All your cosmetics were stale in their jars. Broken cutlery\
  \ lay thick on the floor. My police car was parked outside. Your lipstick was smudged.\
  \ My brakes were bust. The car careered into a tree. You broke your neck. I was\
  \ in shock. I wandered off towards the canal. The morning was filled with the sound\
  \ of bells.\nI am the patron saint of blood oranges, disguised as a Turk. My dog\
  \ patrols the footpaths, fangs bared. He has a nose for bee borage, tears it up\
  \ at root. I am fearsome. He is a brute. He chewed a chair to firewood once. I burnt\
  \ it, rich with glee. We stalk the town, my hound and I, down to the stupid beach,\
  \ where stupid tars tell stupid yarns of lands I'll never reach.\nIn this enormous\
  \ ditch, I found a mother tongue. In the blue of holidays, hammers hit anvils, sent\
  \ echoes back to before the war. My house is a haystack. My arms are waving. I'm\
  \ so happy about the weather we're having. Clocks stopped dead, trains jammed in\
  \ sidings. The weather, the weather. It began to pour with rain. So heaven left\
  \ us hopeless in village barns and dance halls, banjos and clarinets, pianos and\
  \ machine-guns.\nBandages, planks, netting and maize. Cork and gauze and suds and\
  \ baize. Filigree vents. Chocolate and tents. Desire, vigilance, treachery, gaze.\n\
  * NOTE\_: Complete nonsense, I realised, as soon as I had typed it. Some of this\
  \ stuff would have appeared in old Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets between 1986\
  \ and 1991.\n[2009-09-08]"
