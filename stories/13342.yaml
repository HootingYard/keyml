text: "After my debaucheries in the fleshpots of the east, I sought further debaucheries\
  \ in the fleshpots of the west. I was sated for a time but then I grew restless,\
  \ and discovered fresh debaucheries in the fleshpots of the south. Some time later\
  \ I went north, but in the north I found no fleshpots, just ice and snow and bitter\
  \ gales and storms so cold my eyelids were frozen shut and I could not see. I stumbled\
  \ about, blind upon an ice floe, and heard the ominous grunting of bears. The wind\
  \ was howling, and my brain was howling, but I made no sound, for my frozen lips\
  \ were blue, and fused together.\nThis was not the death I had foreseen. I had imagined\
  \ myself a dissolute voluptuary, sprawled on a divan, my belly full of wine, keeling\
  \ over suddenly and unknowingly. The only sign of my passing would be when the resident\
  \ band brought some hot carnal jazz number to an end and began to play a funereal\
  \ dirge. Instead I was alone and cold in a blizzard of whiteness, about to be mauled\
  \ and eaten by bears I could not even see.\nThen oh joy! I heard the clatter of\
  \ a helicopter above, and soon enough I was hauled aboard to safety. When my eyelids\
  \ thawed enough to open, I saw that my saviour was Carruthers. Carruthers, my old\
  \ mucker from long ago, before my debaucheries in the fleshpots of the east and\
  \ west and south. Carruthers to whom I had confessed, back then, that the pounding\
  \ of those infernal drums was driving me mad. Carruthers who comforted me when I\
  \ went to pieces in the tropics. Now here he was again, at the controls of the helicopter.\n\
  \u201CYou came much too far north,\u201D he said, briefly removing the pipe clamped\
  \ between his manly jaws, \u201CYou must have overshot the fleshpots on your journey.\
  \ There are indeed northern fleshpots. I shall take you straight to them so you\
  \ can continue with your debaucheries.\u201D\n\u201CNo!\u201D, I cried, as soon\
  \ as my lips had thawed sufficiently to allow me to open my mouth, \u201CI have\
  \ learned a valuable moral lesson in the inhospitable bleakness of the ice-girt\
  \ north. From this day on I shall shun debaucheries of all kinds, and devote my\
  \ life to proper manly pursuits. Just keep me away from those drums and their infernal\
  \ pounding.\u201D\nCarruthers nodded. And with that, he changed course, and took\
  \ me to some corner of the earth with overcast skies and light breezes, mild and\
  \ with occasional drizzle, temperate, temperate, and free of all temptations.\n\
