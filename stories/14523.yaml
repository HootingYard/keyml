text: "In Forbrydelsen, the 2007 Danish TV crime thriller known here as The Killing,\
  \ there was a minor character, appearing in just three of the twenty episodes, named\
  \ Knud Padde. I confess that I have forgotten pretty much everything about the character\
  \ but for his name\u2014but what a name! Knud Padde ought, surely, to have his own\
  \ spin-off series.\nI can imagine him, dapper in his Danish duds, as one of the\
  \ Four Norsemen of the Apocalypse, alongside Lars and Bengt and Erik, a quartet\
  \ of impossibly sophisticated Scandinavians, noble of brow and fond of herring.\
  \ I am assuming, of course, that \u201CNorsemen\u201D can refer to any old Scandinavian,\
  \ not exclusively those from Norway, though if we had to export Knud Padde and his\
  \ fellows to Norway then so be it.\nWe could, after all, put them on the banks of\
  \ a fjord. What would the Apocalypse look like, viewed from a fjord? I asked fjord-\
  \ and Apocalypse-expert Tarleton Buchbinder for his thoughts. He never called me\
  \ back. I think he was taking a very long bath, in his tub, listening to a cassette\
  \ tape of inspirational speeches by Patricia Fripp, sister of the guitarist Robert,\
  \ husband of popstrel Toyah Wilcox.\nToyah's big hit was \u201CIt'th A Mythtery\u201D\
  , and I think the Knud Padde TV series ought to have a mystery element. The mystery\
  \ could be some unspoken horror in Knud Padde's past, or in Lars's past, or Bengt's\
  \ past, or Erik's past, or perhaps in the pasts of all four of them, the unspoken\
  \ horror that brought the four of them together in the first place, on the banks\
  \ of a fjord, in a high and icy wind, noble of brow and fond of herring.\nThis needs\
  \ work.\n[2016-01-30]"
