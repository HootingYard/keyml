  \ grateful to Richard Carter, FCD, for drawing it to my attention. He writes:\n\
  Sadly, Orwell recorded the abandonment of his egg-count in his diary entry for 13th\
  \ March, 1940:\n\u2026Have now lost accurate count of the eggs & shall have to close\
  \ the egg-account book, which however gives an accurate account stretching over\
  \ 7 months, useful for future reference. From the milkman's account it appears the\
  \ hens have laid 270 eggs since 29.1.40 (6 weeks about). Yesterday 10. It is now\
  \ difficult to sell eggs, as there is a glut, so shall put some in water-glass.\n\
  Orwell's egg counting lasted much longer than my own pitiful attempt at a squirrel\
  \ count, and he was surely correct to note how useful it would be for future reference.\
  \ I am sure all Hooting Yard readers will share my sense of loss, knowing there\
  \ are no further egg tallies to pore over.\n[2010-03-15]"
