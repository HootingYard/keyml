text: "Dobson wrote extensively during the period when he was hunkered down in a janitorium.\
  \ The key pamphlets from this time were collected in a compendium and published\
  \ as a thick paperback with a garish cover design suitable for sale at airport bookstalls.\
  \ It is thought to be the only instance where Dobson's name was embossed in gold.\
  \ Alas, this failed to impress the reading public, and very few copies of the book\
  \ were sold, although we should bear in mind that I write of a time before mass\
  \ commercial aeroplane travel, so there were fewer airports, and even fewer airport\
  \ bookstalls, and only a handful of customers frequenting those that did exist.\n\
  One early airport bookstall worthy of note was that opened at Tantarabim Rustic\
  \ Airfield by Marigold Chew's cousin Basil Chew. Basil was a peg-legged pear-shaped\
  \ man with tremendous Ruritanian moustachios, a fuddle-headed entrepreneur whose\
  \ every business scheme failed. He simply had no grasp of reality, his view of the\
  \ world being at once mistaken, hallucinatory, and plain wrong. If one were unkind,\
  \ one would call him a blockhead. But he had charm, and winning ways, and when he\
  \ twirled those fine moustachios people swooned with besotment. Thus he was able\
  \ to convince a few foolhardy financiers to back his airport bookstall, where, under\
  \ the delusion that aeroplanes flew at the speed of a peasant trudging along a muddy\
  \ country lane and that passengers would need extremely fat books to keep them occupied,\
  \ he stocked only mighty tomes of great and forbidding length. Proust's \xC0 la\
  \ recherche du temps perdu, Robert Burton's The Anatomy Of Melancholy, Boswell's\
  \ The Life Of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. Comprehending An Account Of His Studies And\
  \ Numerous Works, In Chronological Order; A Series Of His Epistolatory Correspondence\
  \ And Conversations With Many Eminent Persons; And Various Original Pieces Of His\
  \ Composition, Never Before Published: The Whole Exhibiting A View Of Literature\
  \ And Literary Men In Great-Britain, For Near Half A Century, During Which He Flourished,\
  \ and Henry Darger's The Story Of The Vivian Girls, In What Is Known As The Realms\
  \ Of The Unreal, Of The Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused By The Child Slave\
  \ Rebellion were, in fact, the only books available at Basil Chew's bookstall until,\
  \ under pressure from his cousin, he agreed to carry the gold-embossed Dobson compendium.\
  \ During the six months the business lasted, he did not sell a single book, and\
  \ was kept afloat only by his sideline in toffee apples, in-flight pastry novelties,\
  \ and moustachio wax.\nA compelling reason for the lack of success of Dobson's big\
  \ fat book is not so much its preposterous length but that, curiously, he did not\
  \ include an account of the most interesting thing that happened during the janitorium\
  \ period. This was the series of events that have elsewhere been described as Dobson\
  \ And The Disquieting Ploppy Noises From Behind A Panel, the title given to a ravishing\
  \ essay by ravishing essayist Maud Glubb. A close reading of La Glubb's text reveals\
  \ many fascinating details, but is far from complete. Most annoyingly, we have no\
  \ idea of what the panel, from behind which Dobson heard disquieting ploppy noises,\
  \ was made. Was it teak, or tin, or mahogany, or lead, or hardboard, or deal, or\
  \ zinc, or beaten gold, or corrugated cardboard, or iron, or papier mach\xE9, or\
  \ bauxite, or empacted goat hair, or plastic, or balsa wood, or formica, or stitched-together\
  \ pelts from slaughtered wolves, or bronze, or marble, or dough, or gases suspended\
  \ in a solid state? Glubb does not tell us.\nWhat we do know is that, sprawled upon\
  \ the floor one Tuesday morning in April, the pamphleteer was disquieted by ploppy\
  \ noises, the source of which he soon traced to behind the panel, whatever the panel\
  \ was, and whatever function it played within the janitorium. We know, too, that\
  \ as a result of his disquiet he rummaged in a drawer for a chisel with which to\
  \ prise apart the panel from whatever it was fixed to, in order to ascertain the\
  \ nature of the ploppy noises and to staunch them. We know that he failed to find\
  \ a chisel nor any chisel-like tool with which to accomplish the task. That nothing\
  \ in the nature of a chisel was to be found in the drawer, within a janitorium,\
  \ is perplexing, and it is a point to which ravishing essayist Maud Glubb returns\
  \ later in her ravishing essay. We know that Dobson leaned against the wall and\
  \ lit one of his acrid Paraguayan cigarettes and puffed upon it as he bent an attentive\
  \ ear to the continued ploppy noises, and we know that anon the ploppy noises petered\
  \ out and that Dobson stamped out the butt of his Paraguayan cigarette with his\
  \ boot and that he clumped out of the janitorium into the April morning and took\
  \ a turn around a nearby pond. We do not know what the weather was like, and we\
  \ do not know whether the pond was populated by ducks, or geese, or swans, or indeed\
  \ if it was home to a grampus or a kraken. Unlikely as the last two may be, remember\
  \ that the pond in the grounds of the janitorium was no ordinary pond, as you will\
  \ know if you have read Dobson's pamphlet Some Arresting, Diverting, And Frankly\
  \ Sensational Factoids Regarding Certain Ponds I Have Had The Pleasure To Take A\
  \ Turn Around, In All Weathers, Arranged In Alphabetical Order By Pond Name. Some\
  \ have pointed to the pamphleteer's use of \u2018factoid\u2019 rather than \u2018\
  fact\u2019 to cast doubt on the veracity of this pamphlet, but it should be borne\
  \ in mind that it was written at a time when Dobson was beset by benign seizures\
  \ in his cranial integuments and he was not his usual self.\nThe next time Dobson\
  \ was disquieted by ploppy noises from behind the panel was a fortnight later. It\
  \ was now May, the month in which the Dutch observe the Remembrance of the Dead\
  \ and the Norwegians celebrate their Constitution. Being neither Dutch nor Norwegian,\
  \ the pamphleteer had no reason to mark these events, yet he did so, loudly, with\
  \ bellowing and strangulated cries, tears streaming down his face, and picnics.\
  \ He was that kind of man, sometimes. It was on another day in May, however, when,\
  \ shifting his writing desk from one side of the janitorium to the other, he again\
  \ heard the disquieting ploppy noises from behind the panel. He had not forgotten\
  \ his fruitless search for a chisel in the drawer, and was not so foolish as to\
  \ repeat it. Instead, he shoved his writing desk aside, leaving it halfway across\
  \ the janitorium, tiptoed up to the panel, and pressed one of his ears against it.\
  \ For some reason, La Glubb insists on telling us it was his right ear. She can\
  \ be given to such unnecessary detail\u2014presented without a shred of evidence\u2014\
  and yet remain silent on matters of greater import, which makes her essay as infuriating\
  \ as it is ravishing. Be that as it may, note that on this second occasion Dobson's\
  \ attention to the disquieting ploppy noise from behind the panel was much more\
  \ focussed. In April, after failing to find a chisel, he had leaned insouciantly\
  \ against one of the walls, smoking while he listened, whereas in May, look, he\
  \ is crouching, the side of his head flattened against the panel, and his gob is\
  \ innocent of a fag. Maddeningly, we do not know how long he remained in this creaky\
  \ posture. Perhaps he was there all day, growing increasingly disquieted. What is\
  \ beyond doubt is that the very next day he wrote a note in his journal. His tone\
  \ is tetchy and bespeaks grumblement rather than disquiet, and it is clear that\
  \ the ploppy noises are \u201Cgetting to him\u201D, as they say. Soon enough, however,\
  \ the subject is dropped, and the following sixteen pages of the journal are filled\
  \ with a draft version of a pamphlet upon Chumpot Patent Soap bars he was later\
  \ to abandon, together with a few notes on gale force winds, Hedy Lamarr, and that\
  \ dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea.\n\nShortly after completing that journal\
  \ entry, Dobson took an evening stroll. We do not know what phase the moon was in\
  \ and, being quite staggeringly ignorant of celestial orbs, nor did Dobson. We do\
  \ not know the precise route he took, once he left the grounds of the janitorium,\
  \ although it is likely that he would have passed the canal lock and the tobacconist\
  \ and the badger sanctuary and the recently-demolished community hub. Had he been\
  \ eating cream crackers there would have been a trail of crumbs for a sleuth to\
  \ follow, for the pamphleteer was a messy eater at the best of times, and especially\
  \ so when in motion. We know, however, that he had sworn off crackers of all kinds\
  \ at this time, mistakenly believing them to be the cause of the benign seizures\
  \ in his cranial integuments. This id\xE9e fixe of his had caused a monstrous and\
  \ prolonged argument with Dr Raymilland, and it was to be many years before their\
  \ relations were mended. It is significant that Dobson never felt able to discuss\
  \ his disquiet at the ploppy noises from behind the panel with his physician, for\
  \ Dr Raymilland was a man with much medical experience of unaccountable noises,\
  \ ploppy and otherwise, and he may well have been able to recommend a course of\
  \ action, probably involving muffling, and cushions. All we know for certain is\
  \ that, upon returning to the janitorium in darkness, Dobson poked his head around\
  \ the door for a midnight check and heard again the disquieting ploppy noises from\
  \ behind the panel. It is unclear what made him snap, but he made a sudden dash\
  \ across the room and gave the panel a resounding kick with his boot. We do not\
  \ know if he cried out as he did so, but afterwards, in the darkness, there was\
  \ silence. The pamphleteer lit one of his acrid Paraguayan cigarettes and waited.\
  \ His toes throbbed, for his boot was old and floppier than it had once been. He\
  \ waited in the darkness, in the janitorium, in the silence, flicking the ash from\
  \ his cigarettes on to the feng shui monkey puzzle carpeting system, until dawn\
  \ broke.\nMaud Glubb's ravishing scholarly apparatus collapses at this point in\
  \ her essay, and the next thing we know it is September, the month in which the\
  \ Zulu commemorate King Shaka, after whom, of course, bestselling paperback author\
  \ Pebblehead was named. Had Pebblehead been writing at the time Basil Chew opened\
  \ his ill-fated airport bookstall, the peg-legged and pear-shaped entrepreneur would\
  \ no doubt have thrown out his Prousts and Burtons and Boswells and Dargers, and\
  \ stocked his shelves with the countless fat glossy potboilers churned out by that\
  \ most indefatigable of authors. Apparently, at every minute of the day, somewhere\
  \ in the world, someone is reading a Pebblehead paperback. Glubb is a very different\
  \ kind of writer, and while we suspect that Pebblehead would never let his apparatus\
  \ collapse, and we would never forgive him if it did, it is the kind of thing we\
  \ expect from the ravishing essayist, and we do not let it trouble us. So, when\
  \ we skip from the scene of Dobson on a night in May, having successfully silenced\
  \ the disquieting ploppy noises from behind the panel with a flying kick of his\
  \ boot, to a torrential downpour in October, and the pamphleteer slumped scowling\
  \ in a bus shelter, smoking a mentholated Bolivian stogie, we simply press on, agog.\n\
  We soon learn that little had changed except the weather and Dobson's preferred\
  \ brand of cigarettes. He was waiting for a bus in the rain because he had been\
  \ summoned to an appointment with the official in charge of the janitorium and of\
  \ several other outlying facilities. This official, a preening autocrat of many\
  \ hats, had been inundated with letters from the pamphleteer begging to be transferred\
  \ from the janitorium on account of the disquieting ploppy noises from behind the\
  \ panel. After that night in May, the noises had returned, insistently, and no amount\
  \ of kicking the panel made them cease, as Dobson discovered to his cost. He had\
  \ even gone to the expense of a brand new pair of sturdy boots with toughened toecaps,\
  \ the better to kick the panel, but to no avail. So began his written pleas to the\
  \ official. Dobson knew that among the outlying facilities attached to the janitorium\
  \ was a cow byre, and it was to this dilapidated rustic hideyhole that he hoped\
  \ to be sent. He did not confess, in his many missives, that he was unpractised\
  \ in the niceties of cow care, and this may have been his undoing. As it was, the\
  \ preening autocrat ignored all of Dobson's letters, until they began to arrive\
  \ at a rate of two or three per shift. The disquieting ploppy noises from behind\
  \ the panel were steadily driving the pamphleteer crackers, and the tone of his\
  \ letters was growing ever more hysterical.\nAs Maud Glubb observes, it would be\
  \ instructive if we could compare the unrestrained prose of these desperate pleadings\
  \ with the overwrought and majestic style of the middle-period pamphlets, but to\
  \ date no Dobsonist of any standing has taken on such a task. There would, of course,\
  \ be difficulties with the handwriting, for when Dobson's brain was fuming his already\
  \ crabbed and blotted scrawl became almost illegible. He is not alone among the\
  \ greats in challenging the eyesight of those wishing to decipher his manuscripts.\
  \ According to Jerome B Lavay, in Disputed Handwriting\_: An Exhaustive, Valuable,\
  \ And Comprehensive Work Upon One Of The Most Important Subjects of To-day (1909),\
  \ \u201CCharlotte Bronte's writing seemed to have been traced with a cambric needle,\
  \ and Thackeray's writing, while marvelously neat and precise, was so small that\
  \ the best of eyes were needed to read it. Likewise the writing of Captain Marryatt\
  \ was so microscopic that when he was interrupted in his labours he was obliged\
  \ to mark the place where he left off by sticking a pin in the paper. Napoleon's\
  \ was worse than illegible, and it is said that his letters from Germany to the\
  \ Empress Josephine were at first thought to be rough maps\u2026 Byron's handwriting\
  \ was nothing more than a scrawl. The writing of Dickens was minute, and he had\
  \ a habit of writing with blue ink on blue paper\u201D.\nWe must assume that, at\
  \ some point in the first week of October, the preening autocrat smacked his forehead\
  \ in despair at the tottering pile of letters arriving from the janitorium, for\
  \ he took the unusual step of summoning the complainant to his headquarters. Fang\
  \ Castle was situated high on a crag around which bats skittered and swooped. The\
  \ bus from which the pamphleteer alighted in the teeming rain stopped at the foot\
  \ of the crag, and Dobson had many, many steps to climb before he would reach the\
  \ entrance to the castle. He was less than half way up when his ill-advised pink\
  \ and yellow and polka dot Kennebunkport cap attracted the attention of several\
  \ bats, and a passing crow. Startled, the pamphleteer lost his footing, sprained\
  \ his ankle, and plunged into a clump of buttercups. He lay there helpless for three\
  \ days, hidden from the bus route by a row of lupins and hollyhocks, Fang Castle\
  \ looming above him high on the crag.\nWe know that Dobson was dismissed from the\
  \ janitorium before the end of October, for there is a journal entry, clearly written\
  \ on Hallowe'en, where he refers to his relief at no longer having to suffer the\
  \ disquieting ploppy noises from behind the panel. What we do not know is whether\
  \ he was writing from the cow byre. In a particularly ravishing passage in her ravishing\
  \ essay, Maud Glubb drops hints that she has identified the precise location where\
  \ Dobson was hunkered down on that Hallowe'en, going so far as to claim that she\
  \ may even have it pinpointed on a map, but she does not say if she is talking about\
  \ the cow byre or somewhere else entirely. Nor do we know what Dobson did at the\
  \ end of his three days in the buttercups. When the sprain in his ankle eased, did\
  \ he clamber up those many, many steps and confront the preening autocrat in Fang\
  \ Castle, or did he shuffle to the bus stop and return to the janitorium? Meteorological\
  \ records indicate that it was still raining heavily, so the pamphleteer would have\
  \ been sodden through. Indeed, he may have been so soaked that he would have been\
  \ forbidden to board the bus for fear that any puddles he created may have dribbled\
  \ into the underfloor electrical wiring and caused the bus to explode or crash.\
  \ Researchers other than Maud Glubb have pored over the records of bus mishaps for\
  \ the relevant period, and there is a tantalising clue in a report in the St Bibblybibdib\
  \ Parish Newsletter And Fold-Out Raffle Ticket which alludes to an exploding bus\
  \ crashing near Fang Castle due to an underfloor electrical wiring fault during\
  \ a torrential downpour, but the newsletter was only published twice a year and\
  \ the date on this copy is unreadable, due to smudging.\nIn this morass of Rumsfeldian\
  \ known unknowns, it is an unexpected delight to chance upon solid, incontrovertible\
  \ fact. Here, reproduced without comment, is a passage from Digby Hoist's memoir\
  \ Out And About With Pebblehead:\nThat leap year, on the twenty-ninth of February,\
  \ I joined the bestselling paperbackist on a hike. We roamed o'er hill and dale\
  \ for mile upon mile, snacking on berries and weeds and drinking milk we eked from\
  \ unattended cows in the fields. It should not have surprised me that Pebblehead\
  \ had an enviable milking technique when presented with an udder. He is, after all,\
  \ a man of parts. We investigated knots of furze and vetch and certain unnatural\
  \ topiary sites as catalogued by Drain & Huffington. I demonstrated to Pebblehead\
  \ a method of vaulting across rivers using a stick and a paperclip, and he showed\
  \ me how to lure a badger from its sett with blandishments. Oh how we chuckled in\
  \ a wry, manly way as we pranced across the loam! Scudding clouds overhead threatened\
  \ drizzle, so in mid-afternoon we took refuge in a ruin. As we crouched on what\
  \ looked to me like the ragged remains of a feng shui monkey puzzle carpeting system,\
  \ once so unaccountably popular, I noticed that Pebblehead grew quiet. His moustache\
  \ bristled, and his ears emitted wispy fumes. When I made to speak, he hushed me\
  \ by wedging a shard of slate in my mouth and bashing the side of my head with his\
  \ fists. The drizzle turned into a violent shower that lasted less than a minute,\
  \ and then the sun blazed down on us again. I was all for leaving the ruin and continuing\
  \ with our hike, for I was keen to show Pebblehead a pig enclosure I knew to be\
  \ nearby, where the pigs were fantastic, but something in his demeanour gave me\
  \ pause. He seemed strangely disquieted. Eventually, he began to speak, in a voice\
  \ that was not his own. Instead of that familiar high-pitched, reedy squawk, like\
  \ a drugged-up corncrake, his words boomed out, deep and deafening. I spat out the\
  \ shard of slate and shoved my hands over my ears, but still that voice penetrated\
  \ my soul as if I were in the presence of some ancient, terrible god.\n\u201CBehold\
  \ the realm of Gaar!\u201D said the Pebblehead who was not Pebblehead, \u201CIt\
  \ is ruin now, but once, not so long ago, it was the place where dwelt my fiend.\
  \ That spot where you crouch, puny specimen of humankind, was my panel, and behind\
  \ my panel my fiend paid obeisance to me. To the imperfect ears of you earthly pipsqueaks,\
  \ the horrifying and insane and magnificent and berserk ritual jabberings of my\
  \ fiend sounded as but ploppy noises which caused disquiet rather than paralysing\
  \ terror. One day my fiend shall return, and all shall be swept away. It will be\
  \ swept away and gone.\u201D\nThe voice ceased. Somewhere a linnet tweeted. The\
  \ wispy fumes from Pebblehead's ears dispersed, and his moustache stopped bristling.\
  \ He looked at me, as if nothing had happened, and piped up \u201CThe rain has stopped,\
  \ Digby. Let us go and take a cold hard look at those fantastic pigs you were telling\
  \ me about!\u201D\n[2008-04-24]"
