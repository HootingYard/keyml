  \ out-of-season English seaside resort, I have a solution to the whole bloody mess.\
  \ We know, from listening to the news on the wireless, that economists witter on\
  \ about a \u201Cbasket of currencies\u201D. No wonder we face fiscal Armageddon\
  \ if all the money is put in baskets! If everyone did as I do, and kept their cash\
  \ in a pippy bag, I think we would see a dramatic about-turn in the global economy.\
  \ Now I am going to take my dog Skippy for a seashore walk. Bye bye.\n[2008-09-30]"
