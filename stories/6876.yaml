text: "Last week I spent some time as usual updating my log of Outa_Spaceman's cardboard\
  \ reality interventions. Commonly, my practice is to log the details of each intervention\
  \ on a piece of cardboard and then to stow the piece of cardboard away in a cardboard\
  \ box and forget about it. Intervention number 187, however, haunted my thoughts,\
  \ night and day, until I felt impelled to take the lid off the cardboard box and\
  \ remove the piece of cardboard on which I had logged the details. I propped it\
  \ up against a similar, but empty, cardboard box in my fustiparlour, to keep it\
  \ within my purview at all times, or at least at those times when I was indoors.\n\
  \u201CDepressed horse never knew saucepans\u201D reads the legend on intervention\
  \ number 187. Where had I heard those words, in that order, before? Was it the title\
  \ piece in a slim volume of twee verse by Dennis Beerpint? Was it a chapter heading\
  \ from a bestselling paperback potboiler by Pebblehead? Or could it be the code\
  \ phrase uttered by international woman of mystery Primrose Dent to gain access\
  \ to her secret subterranean headquarters?\nLuckily, there are reference books where\
  \ one can look up this sort of thing, so I looked them up. That is, I looked up\
  \ Beerpint and Pebblehead and Primrose Dent, in a biographical reference book, but\
  \ grew none the wiser. I then consulted reference works on depression, horses, and\
  \ saucepans, still to no avail. Yet the words continued to swirl around in my brain,\
  \ their origin tantalisingly out of reach.\nPreviously on Hooting Yard, as they\
  \ say in the American television series, when faced with such quandaries I have\
  \ stalked off into the deep dense dark woods of Woohoohoodiwoo and sought the counsel\
  \ of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. That freakish crone is a dab hand in the arts of\
  \ recovered memory syndrome, and more than once she has brought bubbling to the\
  \ surface of my cranium material which might otherwise have remained forever obscure\
  \ and buried. On this occasion, however, my people learned from her people that\
  \ the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman had gone on her holidays, to some benighted and dilapidated\
  \ seaside resort, to suck sticks of rock and commune with seagulls in bird-language\
  \ from the balcony of her seashore chalet. It came as something of a surprise to\
  \ me to learn that the eldritch hag took holidays, like normal people do, and as\
  \ I am ill-equipped to deal with surprises of any nature, I took to my bed for forty-eight\
  \ hours, tossing and turning and whimpering weakly, as illusory phantasms gambolled\
  \ and frolicked across the ceiling of my boudoir. The boudoir adjoins the fustiparlour,\
  \ and by keeping the door open I was able to peer at the piece of cardboard propped\
  \ against the empty cardboard box upon which I had logged the details of intervention\
  \ number 187, including, of course, those haunting words.\nBy the time I was ready\
  \ to face the world again, I had resolved to try to forget all about the depressed\
  \ horse that never knew saucepans. The first step in my forgetting was to put the\
  \ piece of cardboard back in the cardboard box where all my cardboard signage loggings\
  \ were stored, but I made the mistake of preparing a snack before so doing. It was\
  \ not the cream crackers which unhinged me, as they have done before. No, it was\
  \ the processed cheese triangle I took from the refrigerator, intending it as an\
  \ accompaniment, to be spread upon the cream crackers with a spatula. I did not\
  \ even get as far as unwrapping the processed cheese triangle, transfixed as I was\
  \ by the illustration, on its wrapper, of a laughing cow. Perversely, perhaps, the\
  \ sight of a happy cow made me think immediately of a depressed horse. I replaced\
  \ the processed cheese triangle, unopened and uneaten, in the refrigerator, and\
  \ shovelled the cream crackers into my mouth one by one, chewing them to a pulp,\
  \ and reflected sadly that until I could discover where in the name of all that\
  \ is holy I had first encountered the words \u201CDepressed horse never knew saucepans\u201D\
  , tormented me would never know rest.\nYou will be familiar with the phrases \u201C\
  barrack-room lawyer\u201D and \u201Cpub philosopher\u201D. Well, later that day\
  \ I fell into conversation with a milk bar Jesuit. He had the appearance, character,\
  \ mental agility, wiliness, black soutane, and fanatical religious commitment of\
  \ a Jesuit, yet he was a mere habitu\xE9\_of the milk bar into which I popped to\
  \ get a glass of milk with which to wash down my dry cream cracker snack. He was\
  \ sitting at a table, drawing on it a line with a piece of chalk, as if he were\
  \ about to mesmerise a duck, a Jesuitical trick once practised, on the twenty-seventh\
  \ of April 1871 by Gerard Manley Hopkins, an actual Jesuit. There were no ducks\
  \ to be seen in the milk bar, however, and when he invited me to sit at the empty\
  \ place opposite his, I accepted. With his pincer-like brain he rapidly grasped\
  \ that I was a troubled soul, and before the milk bar skivvy had brought me my glass\
  \ of milk, I found I was pouring out those troubles.\n\u201CIt is good that you\
  \ did not stray down a pagan path by unburdening your soul to the Woohoohoodiwoo\
  \ Woman in the deep dense dark woods of Woohoohoodiwoo,\u201D he said, when I had\
  \ finished telling the tally of my woes, by which time my milk had arrived, in a\
  \ smudged and greasy glass.\n\u201CIt seems to me,\u201D he continued, \u201CThere\
  \ are two ways to approach the problem, if problem it is.\u201D\n\u201COh?\u201D\
  \ I asked, between slurps of milk.\n\u201CFirst, it could be that the laughing cow\
  \ on the wrapping of your processed cheese triangle holds the key to the conundrum.\
  \ It is certainly worth investigating the possibility that there exists, somewhere,\
  \ on this continent or one of the others, a manufacturer of saucepans whose emblem\
  \ is a depressed cow. Find that manufacturer, and you find the source of the phrase\
  \ that haunts you!\u201D\nI nodded my agreement, but protested that I had already\
  \ consulted a huge number of reference books without coming upon a mention of any\
  \ such saucepan manufacturer. He chuckled Jesuitically.\n\u201CWell, no work of\
  \ reference is truly exhaustive, not even the Bible,\u201D he said, \u201CThough\
  \ that would be a good place to start. In the King James Version, for example, there\
  \ are forty-three mentions of \u2018horse\u2019 and one hundred and nine of \u2018\
  horses\u2019. And while it is true that one will search in vain for the words \u2018\
  depressed\u2019 and 'saucepan\u2019, it would be well to follow up the one hundred\
  \ and six instances of \u2018woe\u2019, the twenty-two of \u2018pot\u2019 and the\
  \ fifteen of \u2018pots\u2019. I would aver that the difference between a depressed\
  \ horse that never knew saucepans and a woebegone horse that never knew pots is\
  \ purely academic.\u201D\nI was about to express my surprise that a Jesuit would\
  \ call on the authority of the King James Version rather than, say, the Douai Bible\
  \ favoured by Catholics, but then I recalled that he was only a milk bar Jesuit,\
  \ not a real one. It also occurred to me that, surprised as I was, if only momentarily,\
  \ I remained eerily calm, and in no danger whatsoever of having to collapse back\
  \ into my bed for a further forty-eight hours.\n\u201CYou said there were two ways\
  \ to approach the problem,\u201D I said, \u201CWhat is the second?\u201D\n\u201C\
  I hope your question does not indicate that you have dismissed out of hand my recommendation\
  \ that you seek the answer in the Holy Book?\u201D he rapped back.\n\u201CNo,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CI shall track down all the woe and horse and pot references as you\
  \ suggest. But it's fair to say I don't hold out much hope.\u201D\n\u201CVery well,\u201D\
  \ he said, steepling his fingers together, as if in prayer, and resting his chin\
  \ upon them, \u201CThe second approach is as follows. Look carefully at these lines\
  \ in chalk I have drawn upon the milk bar table.\u201D\nI did so\u2014and was mesmerised,\
  \ just like Hopkins's duck. And it was while I was thus entranced that the milk\
  \ bar Jesuit vouchsafed to me the reason for my nagging sense that somewhere before\
  \ I had heard, or read, the words \u201CDepressed horse never knew saucepans\u201D\
  .\nLaughably, my first surmise had been almost correct. It\_was the title of a Dennis\
  \ Beerpint poem! But the title of a poem the weedy poetaster had not yet written,\
  \ nor even conceived within that frothing poetic brain inside his head! How then\
  \ could I already know it? Well, when he snapped me out of the trance, the milk\
  \ bar Jesuit revealed himself as an aficionado of Beerpint, my\_compadre in that\
  \ little fellowship of admirers whose buzzings and twangings on the so-called Beerpintosphere\
  \ keep track of everything, yes,\_everything even tangentially relevant to the poet\
  \ and his doings, even his dreams. Dennis Beerpint had dreamed of writing a poem\
  \ entitled \u201CDepressed horse never knew saucepans\u201D, and I had dreamed of\
  \ his dream, and someone else had buzzed or twanged my dream on their own Beerpintoblabberblob.\
  \ At last it all made sense!\nI drained the last mouthful of milk from my glass,\
  \ stood up, and bid the milk bar Jesuit farewell. As I crashed out of the door into\
  \ the street, I saw, in the distance, a duckpond. Several ducks were waddling their\
  \ way slowly towards the milk bar. It seemed there were to be further mesmeric revelations\
  \ before the day was done. I smiled at the thought, quite unlike a depressed horse,\
  \ and headed for home, and my laughing cow.\n\n[2011-07-11]"
