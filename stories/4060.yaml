text: "A duck in a pond, a pond near a swamp. Sometimes, the duck walks across the\
  \ mud from the pond to the swamp and, standing on the edge, looks into the stagnant\
  \ filth, like a duck Narcissus. On the horizon there are trees\u2014larch, beech,\
  \ sycamore, pine. Having gazed, unblinking, at its reflection, blurry, blurry, the\
  \ duck turns about and walks back to the pond, into which it plashes, and often\
  \ times upends itself, so to a passer-by only its fundament and feet are visible,\
  \ its head and upper body submerged in the water. When a breeze gusts, as it usually\
  \ does, the leaves on trees on the horizon rustle. If the breeze becomes a gale,\
  \ the trees sway. Once the wind grew so strong one of them, a beech, crashed to\
  \ the ground, its topmost twigs and branches falling into the swamp at the swamp's\
  \ edge. Fortunately for the duck, it was in the pond when this happened. The sky\
  \ was black, for the wind was howling in the night, and there were no stars to be\
  \ seen, because of clouds. The duck was terrified.\nIf ever you pass by that pond,\
  \ chuck some stale breadcrusts to the duck. If you are on your way to the trees,\
  \ to take measurements, or to carve your initials and those of your sweetheart into\
  \ the bark on a trunk, be sure to skirt the swamp. Even the stoutest and most voluminous\
  \ wading boots will not save you from sinking into the murk and slime, glubb glubb\
  \ glubb. If you take the proper route to the trees, you will pass the memorial garden\
  \ where stones and piles of pebbles and rugged wooden crosses mark those whose souls\
  \ the swamp has claimed. The duck has seen some of them, from the safety of its\
  \ pond, as they sank, flailing and helpless and screaming. It is a traumatised duck.\n\
