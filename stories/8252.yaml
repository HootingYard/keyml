text: "A recent survey suggests that the truculence of peasants comes top in a list\
  \ of baronial dissatisfactions. A huge percentage of barons expressed the view that\
  \ a truculent peasantry caused them greater mental anguish than the crumbling of\
  \ castle crenellations, outbreaks of disease in cows, and torrential rainfall.\n\
  Elspeth Grimpenmire, of pollsters YouBaron, said \u201CThis is an important finding.\
  \ It shows that subjugation of the peasantry is high on the list of policy initiatives\
  \ most barons would support. For the king to faff about with pie in the sky ideas\
  \ about improving the lot of belligerent rustics shows just how out of touch he\
  \ is.\u201D\nThe king has not issued an official statement in response, although\
  \ a palace spokeschamberlain insisted that plans were well under way for increased\
  \ smiting, burning of villages, destruction of crops and associated mayhem.\nNo\
  \ one from the peasantry was available for comment. That doesn't really matter,\
  \ as they are all illiterate and would be incapable of reading any snag-toothed\
  \ babble reported here in any case.\nQuestions were raised about the reliability\
  \ of the survey, however, when it came to light that only three barons were polled,\
  \ each of whom was an empanelled official of the Association of Brutish Barons.\
  \ From its grim headquarters in a castle keep on the edge of a marsh known locally\
  \ for the poisonous vapours which hover in a mist o'er it, the Association regularly\
  \ sends out marauding gangs of ruffians to bash up and lop the limbs off selected\
  \ peasants. These gangs will usually haul back to the castle carts piled high with\
  \ whatever agricultural produce they can gather from the peasantry's pitiful patches\
  \ of tillage, together with a few hostages.\nAn Association spokesbrute explained\
  \ \u201CIf we don't terrorise the peasantry, who will?\u201D\nDoctor Dust, an alchemist\
  \ and necromancer retained by the Association as a consultant, recently passed his\
  \ hands in oddly significant sweeping movements over a bowl containing a decoction\
  \ of boiled amphibians, herbs, blood, semen, twigs and black bile and, after gazing\
  \ into it for an hour, announced something which, unfortunately, came out as gibberish.\
  \ But it is thought his eldritch manoeuvres, accompanied by various portents seen\
  \ in the sky, suggest an uprising of the peasants at a future time.\n\u201CWhat\
  \ Doctor Dust can see in his mysterious bowl is all the more reason to suppress\
  \ the rabble in the here and now,\u201D said a brutish baron, sharpening the blade\
  \ of his bloodstained axe upon a whetstone, \u201CWe should certainly pay no heed\
  \ to those so-called enlightened barons.\u201D\nThe reference is to a newly formed\
  \ groupuscule, the Association of Enlightened Barons, whose castle headquarters,\
  \ far from being engulfed by poisonous marsh vapours, is decorated with pretty pink\
  \ flags billowing in a balmy breeze.\n\u201CWe like to think of the peasantry as\
  \ stakeholders,\u201D said one enlightened baron, \u201CAnd though it may be hard\
  \ to do blue sky thinking under this leaden pall, with threats of a downpour, we\
  \ are convinced that they need not be truculent and belligerent, if treated with\
  \ a little loving kindness and offered the prospect of a future world with many\
  \ enticing leisure and retail facilities.\u201D\nInterestingly, even the peasants\
  \ themselves ridicule this fatuity. We cannot quote them for obvious reasons, and\
  \ as it happens most of the peasants we approached for an interview were to be found\
  \ drunk out of their heads on some gruesome brew, fighting among each other, or\
  \ lying unconscious in ditches.\nSuch scenes are welcome to the brutish barons,\
  \ who will take the opportunity to charge out of their castles on horseback and\
  \ trample the distracted and insensible peasantry under the clattering hooves of\
  \ their mighty steeds.\n\u201CI often find it gives my horse quite a fillip if I\
  \ let him crush the skulls of a few peasants while out on an afternoon gallop,\u201D\
  \ said one baron, \u201CThough of course that is not the only method we use to crush\
  \ their skulls and other bones. That is why we have dark dank dungeons in our castles,\
  \ where the more truculent peasantry can be subjected to episodes of barbaric cruelty\
  \ that would make the devil himself blanch. Even the most belligerent rustic tends\
  \ to be a little more tractable after he's had most of his bones crushed.\u201D\n\
  In spite of the galloping horses and the dungeons, there has to date been no diminution\
  \ in the truculence of the peasantry. Some commentators put this down to social\
  \ factors such as the baronial tendency to have great feasts, with hunks of venison\
  \ and pig's heads and puddings made from wrens and quail and coot and partridge\
  \ and widgeon, and foaming tankards of mead, while the peasants subsist on gruel.\
  \ Others claim this is the natural order of things, and to tamper with it would\
  \ turn the world upside down and bring chaos and, ultimately, undermine our entire\
  \ understanding of the cosmos.\nOne enlightened baron pops his head over the parapet\
  \ to offer a different view.\n\u201CIt can seem one must be on the side either of\
  \ the brutish barons or of the truculent peasantry,\u201D he opines, \u201CBut luckily\
  \ there is a so-called Blairite third way. It will come to pass.\u201D\nWe shall\
  \ see.\n[2012-01-29]"
