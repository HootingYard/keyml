text: "\u2018Twas in the year 1983 I spent Christmas in Manchester with the ex-Mrs\
  \ Key's sister and her husband, a Mexican anthropologist with a particular interest\
  \ in textiles. We were all young and achingly right-on in a very 1980s way, which\
  \ is why we thought very carefully before buying our Christmas crackers. Not for\
  \ us the crass commercialism of the masses with their false consciousness and weird\
  \ tendency to vote for the hated Thatcher. No, we would make the purchase of crackers\
  \ a political gesture. We bought them from CND.\nOh how we failed to laugh around\
  \ the Christmas dinner table as we pulled our ideologically sound crackers. Out\
  \ fell the expected paper hat and printed slip\u2014and on the latter, there was\
  \ not a terrible and groanworthy joke, but a sobering fact about nuclear weapons\
  \ and the inevitable worldwide holocaust they would cause. We donned our paper hats\
  \ and read out these visions of mass destruction, smug in our righteousness. Then\
  \ we ate and drank our fill and had precisely the same kind of Christmas as the\
  \ lumpenproletariat we so despised.\n[2014-12-25]"
