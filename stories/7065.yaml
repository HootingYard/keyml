text: "On a frosty winter's morning in the middle of the twentieth century, legendary\
  \ athletics coach Old Halob stood at the side of a running track, stopwatch in hand,\
  \ Homburg on head, racked with catarrh and puffing a cigarette. He was much perturbed.\
  \ His prot\xE9g\xE9, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, was pounding round and round\
  \ the track at ever higher speeds, but Old Halob's brain was a whirling chaos. He\
  \ had not slept for weeks, and he was even more bad tempered than usual. The spindly\
  \ fictional sprinter whizzing past him was causing the one-time secret policeman\
  \ much vexation. He was running faster than ever, and when pole-vaulting he was\
  \ pole-vaulting higher than ever. He was winning medals and cups in all sorts of\
  \ fictional athletics meetings, not least the Gloriously Shining Medallion Of Gack,\
  \ awarded to the champ of champs in the Pointy Town Auxiliary Substandard Jumping\
  \ About League Reserve Heats. But for Old Halob, all this was as nought. For what\
  \ he most desired for Bobnit Tivol was fame, and fame eluded him.\nIn the narrow,\
  \ enclosed world of fictional athletics Bobnit Tivol was of course a name to be\
  \ reckoned with. Yet in the wider world he remained unknown. It had long been the\
  \ dream of Old Halob that his prot\xE9g\xE9 be the cynosure of all eyes, a titan\
  \ worshipped not just by fictional athletics fans but by all and sundry, the great\
  \ and good and the hoi polloi. It may be, as some cynics liked to snigger, that\
  \ the wily old coach wished to exploit the sprinter for financial gain. Worldwide\
  \ fame would bring the money pouring in, whether it be for hiring out his image\
  \ to be emblazoned on cardboard breakfast cereal packets or for personal appearances\
  \ at the opening of fairgrounds. Nowadays we are used to such commercial shenanigans,\
  \ but half a century ago they were almost unheard of. Old Halob remains an old fashioned\
  \ figure in many ways, but he always saw himself as a man o\u2019 the future, and\
  \ in pursuit of that vision he strained every sinew, sclerotic though his sinews\
  \ may have been, if there is such a thing as a sclerotic sinew.\nSo on that frosty,\
  \ icy morning, Old Halob took one last puff on his acrid Serbian cigarette, and,\
  \ barking a command to the fictional athlete to keep sprinting faster and faster\
  \ round the running track until his return, he trudged away. He headed for an insalubrious\
  \ part of town where he might find solace in rotgut hooch and squalor. And it was\
  \ as he was about to turn down a particularly dismal alleyway that he was accosted\
  \ by an urchin hawking grubby wares.\n\u201COi, mister, I'm your urchin if you need\
  \ some spent matches or tattered bootlaces or chewed-up dog biscuits or leaking\
  \ batteries or contaminated sausages or poisoned cans of Squelcho! or regurgitated\
  \ hairballs or back copies of the Reader's Digest! Everything's a half-crown!\u201D\
  \n\u201CYour wares are preposterously expensive,\u201D said Old Halob, \u201CBut\
  \ here is a half-crown for a back copy of the Reader's Digest. I shall want something\
  \ to read while I benumb my brain with hooch.\u201D\nLater, sitting in the dinge\
  \ of an ill-starred tavern glugging from a bottle of 90% proof Monsignor's Spasm,\
  \ Old Halob flicked through the pages of the magazine hoping to find something that\
  \ might take his mind off his woes. There was an article entitled \u201CI Am John's\
  \ Head\u201D which diverted him briefly, as did a piece about a heroic anti-communist\
  \ housewife. He made a stab at a quiz based on anagrams of \u201CAyn Rand\u201D\
  . Then he came upon a picture spread of artworks by Sir Frederic Leighton (1830\u2013\
  1896), and saw something that made fireworks go off in his brain. It was a photograph\
  \ of a sculpture by Leighton entitled Athlete Wrestling With A Python (1877). Old\
  \ Halob was transfixed. He ordered another bottle of hooch, and began to formulate\
  \ a scheme.\n\nLeighton's sculpture had been a great popular success in its day.\
  \ Why, then, if Old Halob were to create a modern adaptation, Fictional Athlete\
  \ Wrestling With A Real Python, would that not equally astound the public? What\
  \ could better propel fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol to universal acclaim than the\
  \ sight of him doing battle with an all too real python, and winning?\nDraining\
  \ his second bottle and reeling out of the tavern into the ghastly streets, Old\
  \ Halob decided to leave his spindly prot\xE9g\xE9 haring round the track for the\
  \ time being while he set off to find a python. There was a zoo and a number of\
  \ menageries in the town, but they were all shut, it being a Thursday. Tacked up\
  \ on a lamppost he saw a notice about a newly opened snakepit, and boarded a tram\
  \ to take him there, but the tram crashed into a parade of horses and Old Halob\
  \ was among a number of tram passengers and equestriennes who were ferried to a\
  \ clinic on stretchers. It was nightfall before he was released, bloody and bandaged,\
  \ and he made his way to the running track where, in dusk and drizzle, fictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol, as close to exhaustion as a fictional athlete can be, was\
  \ still zooming round and round. Old Halob parped his whistle, and young Bobnit\
  \ collapsed in a fictional heap upon the cinders.\n\u201CGreat news!\u201D shouted\
  \ Old Halob, \u201CTomorrow you shall wrestle a real python, and the world will\
  \ be agog!\u201D\n\u201CGack,\u201D panted Bobnit Tivol, collapsing still further.\n\
  The next day dawned with more frost and ice and drizzle. Old Halob dragged his fictional\
  \ prot\xE9g\xE9 to the pole-vaulting practice pit and told him to practise pole-vaulting\
  \ until such time as he returned bearing a python. The catarrh-racked coach then\
  \ trudged off to the zoo, to find that it was shut, being a Friday. He soon discovered\
  \ the menageries were likewise shut, and that following the tram crash of the day\
  \ before, no trams were running. Passing the lamppost where he had seen the sign\
  \ announcing the opening of the snakepit, he saw it had been altered, the opening\
  \ having been cancelled by dint of civic pomposity.\n\u201CWhere oh where am I to\
  \ find a python?\u201D wailed Old Halob.\nAt once, from the gloom of a gruesome\
  \ nook, a figure appeared, like Harry Lime in The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949).\
  \ But he looked nothing like Orson Welles. His yellow skin scarcely covered the\
  \ work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing;\
  \ his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid\
  \ contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun\
  \ white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and his straight\
  \ black lips. His voice, when at last he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty\
  \ of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.\n\u201CYou will\
  \ find no pythons here,\u201D he boomed, \u201CBut hie thee to the Bottomless Viper\
  \ Pit of Gaar. There you will find vipers.\u201D\nAnd with that, the gruesome nook\
  \ was again engulfed in gloom, and the figure vanished.\nAs he trudged to the railway\
  \ station to catch the stopping train to Gaar, Old Halob wondered if perhaps, from\
  \ time to time, a python might stray into the bottomless viper pit. Failing that,\
  \ he supposed he could obtain a viper and disguise it as a python or, in extremis,\
  \ rely upon the ophiological stupidity of the great unwashed. Spitting into a bramble-bush,\
  \ Old Halob reflected that the masses, presented with the fantastic spectacle of\
  \ a fictional athlete wrestling with a real snake, would be unlikely to worry their\
  \ pointy little heads about precisely what kind of snake it was. He would say it\
  \ was a python, and lo!, a python it would be.\nIt happened that the stopping train\
  \ to Gaar stopped not only at every single damned station along the branch line,\
  \ but also, repeatedly, in sidings, for hours and even days at a time. The delay\
  \ thus caused was to prove fatal to Old Halob's otherwise flawless plan. And flawless\
  \ indeed did it seem when, arriving eventually at the bottomless viper pit, the\
  \ man in the Homburg hat was greeted by the Duty Viperist, brandishing a net in\
  \ which writhed a living python.\n\u201CWhat ho!\u201D said this fellow, who bore\
  \ a striking resemblance to Orson Welles, \u201CI have just ennetted a python that\
  \ had somehow strayed into the bottomless viper pit. Luckily, I spotted it while\
  \ it was still near the top of the bottomless pit, otherwise who knows what manner\
  \ of slithery hissy funny business might have transpired down towards the earth's\
  \ molten core. An asp got down there once and caused quite a kerfuffle among the\
  \ vipers. But tsk tsk here's me carrying on like a garrulous bon vivant good and\
  \ proper! How may I help you on this frosty icy drizzly day in Gaar?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Give the python to me,\u201D rapped Old Halob.\n\u201CI ought really return it to\
  \ the Nest o\u2019 Writhing Pythons just downaways past the viaduct,\u201D said\
  \ the Viperist, \u201CBut I have just had my breakfast and I am mad with cornflakes,\
  \ so here, the python is yours.\u201D\nOn the way back to Pointy Town, the stopping\
  \ train stopped even more often than it had on the outward journey. But at last,\
  \ long overdue, it chugged into the railway station. Old Halob retrieved the python\
  \ from where he had stowed it in the goods carriage and trudged off in frost and\
  \ ice and drizzle to the pole-vaulting practice pit. He was pleased to see that\
  \ fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol was still, relentlessly, pole-vaulting ever higher\
  \ and higher. He parped his whistle and the spindly youngster collapsed in a heap\
  \ in the sandpit.\n\u201CLater today,\u201D announced Old Halob, \u201CYour name\
  \ will ring out from sea to shining sea, and beyond, possibly even to planets and\
  \ worldlets yet uncharted in the immensity of the boundless universe. Yes, fictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol, you are to wrestle this python I have slung around my shoulders.\
  \ At the moment it is in an induced coma. But I shall awaken it as soon as I have\
  \ rented a large canvas tent and a wrestling ring and put up posters and sounded\
  \ a klaxon to bring the great and the good and the hoi polloi in their teeming masses\
  \ to witness a spectacle unlike anything the world has seen since 1877 when Sir\
  \ Frederic Leighton unveiled his sculpture Athlete Wrestling With A Python! Think\
  \ of the fame that will accrue to your spindly frame as you overpower the vicious\
  \ serpent and crush it beneath your fictional running spikes! I feel sure your image\
  \ will appear on cardboard breakfast cereal packets and you will be invited to open\
  \ fairgrounds before this day is done!\u201D\n\u201CGack,\u201D panted Bobnit Tivol,\
  \ collapsing still further.\nHalf a century later, we might still be babbling excitedly\
  \ about Old Halob's visionary doodah. The tent and ring were rented, the posters\
  \ put up, the klaxon sounded. The python was woken from its coma and placed in a\
  \ ringside python-holding-unit of netting and bamboo. Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\
  \ was limbering up in his fictional ringside limberarium. Puffing on his high tar\
  \ cigarette, Old Halob looked out from the tent flap, expecting to see the teeming\
  \ throngs come hurrying across the fields, an excited hubbub. Yet the fields were\
  \ deserted, apart from a few dejected and immobile cows.\nSuch had been the delays\
  \ occasioned by the stopping train to Gaar, on its wheezing journeys there and back,\
  \ that frosty icy January had turned to frosty icy February. And today it was the\
  \ sixth of February 1958, and the news had swept across town of the Munich Air Disaster,\
  \ and the deaths of the Busby Babes, and all of Pointy Town was in mourning. On\
  \ such a black day for sport, the last thing anybody wanted to see was a fictional\
  \ athlete wrestling with a real python.\n[2011-08-03]"
