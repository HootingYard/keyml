text: "During my long life, one thing I have learned is that whenever one experiences\
  \ a triumph, it is a capital idea to erect an arch in commemoration. Thus, to give\
  \ but one example, when I had a playground spat with a ruffian child, as a mere\
  \ child myself, and I came out on top by bashing the little git on the head with\
  \ a shovel, I proceeded to build an arch, out of cement and straw and pipe-cleaners,\
  \ which I put up in a corner of the playground, so that none would ever forget that\
  \ on that spot, on a hot May morn, I triumphed over Perkins, or whatever his name\
  \ was.\nWell, I am being disingenuous. Of course his name was Perkins, I remember\
  \ it well, for I built the arch of triumph specifically to commemorate my victory.\
  \ It was to be the first of many arches of triumph in my life. As it happened, Perkins\
  \ prompted a second arch, many years later, when the pair of us, long estranged,\
  \ met up by chance one winter's day. I had no idea who he was, but he recognised\
  \ me, probably because I was wearing the insignia of Goosehaven. He began to berate\
  \ me with words, and then with fists, until I grabbed hold of a nearby shovel and\
  \ bashed him on the head with it, again, and he crumpled. The second Perkinsesque\
  \ Arch of Triumph was constructed from concrete and brick and pebbles and the saliva\
  \ of otters. It stands next to a river, in the vicinity of Goosehaven itself.\n\
  I am often asked whether I like to pass underneath my arches of triumph, either\
  \ on foot or borne by a suitably resplendent carriage. My answer, invariably, is\
  \ long-winded and pompous and orotund, and I leave my listeners in some doubt as\
  \ to whether I was saying, in essence, \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cno\u201D. This is\
  \ a quite deliberate ruse on my part. I do not wish to be tied down to certainties.\
  \ They are such a bore.\nThe one certainty I will avow is that I am a man of Goosehaven,\
  \ born and bred. A surprising number of people find this either exasperating or\
  \ objectionable, or both, and do not stint in letting me know their feelings. My\
  \ usual response is to bash such persons on the head with a shovel and then to erect\
  \ upon the spot an arch of triumph. It keeps me busy, which is a boon, for we all\
  \ know that the devil finds work for idle hands to do, or at least so I was told,\
  \ at my mother's knee, when I was a tot, in the Goosehaven of yore, long ago buried\
  \ under car parks and supermarkets and so-called retail \u2018n\u2019 leisure complexes.\
  \ There are ghosts there now, parading in their thousands, borne on resplendent\
  \ phantom carriages, passing under my arches of triumph.\n[2014-10-05]"
