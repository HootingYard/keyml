text: "Every now and then I receive letters from readers asking me to give some account\
  \ of the geography of Hooting Yard and its hinterland. I have a standard reply to\
  \ such requests, which is to say that through diligent study of the writings you\
  \ could draw a map yourself. It would involve very close reading, being on the alert\
  \ for clues and pointers, but all the information any half-competent cartographer\
  \ needs is present in the texts.\nToday, I am going to make things a little easier\
  \ for aspiring mappers by saying a few words about the train journey from Hooting\
  \ Yard to that ill-starred fishing village O'Houlihan's Wharf. Last week it would\
  \ have been fairly pointless to do so, but the exciting news is that the branch\
  \ line, long fallen into desuetude, is running again. Using the proceeds from a\
  \ winning raffle ticket (number 666, beige) a team of volunteers has reopened the\
  \ line as a cross between a \u201Ccountryside heritage family leisure facility\u201D\
  \ and a \u201Ccutting-edge arts praxis installation\u201D. I have taken those two\
  \ phrases from their brochure, a shabby piece of work duplicated on a Gestetner\
  \ machine, designed perhaps to look like one of Dobson's out of print pamphlets.\
  \ Someone has gone to the trouble of hand-colouring all the covers, though, which\
  \ shows the fanatical devotion of these enthusiasts.\n\nI am not one of these nutters\
  \ myself, but I know the journey as well as I know the first three books of Paradise\
  \ Lost, so take my hand, encased in a butcher's mitten, and I shall lead you along\
  \ the way.\n\nOur thrilling railway excursion begins, naturally enough, at Hooting\
  \ Yard. What was once a gigantic terminus alive with hubbub is now a ruin which\
  \ serves mostly as a roost for sparrows. However, the volunteers have recreated\
  \ a very convincing facsimile of one of the original platforms, and it is from here\
  \ that the decrepit steam engine creaks into gear.\n\nIt is, of course, the Civic\
  \ Platform. It had been hoped to place a commemorative copy of the Central Lever\
  \ at one end, but Hazel Blears put the kibosh on that with a series of threatening\
  \ letters. Diminutive and bumptious she may be, but she\u2014or her officials\u2014\
  can certainly write poisonous prose. The branch line volunteer who opens the post\
  \ has been admitted to a clinic for neurasthenics and has taken to wandering the\
  \ grounds in a daze, like Ronald Colman at the beginning of Random Harvest, without\
  \ the military uniform, of course, but with the pencil moustache. Anyway, off we\
  \ go!\n\nThe first stop, some five hours down the line on a good day, is Blister\
  \ Lane. When I say \u201Con a good day\u201D, I mean on a day when the train does\
  \ not sputter to a halt about twenty yards out of Hooting Yard because the track\
  \ is blocked by cows. This can happen distressingly often, for the fields hereabouts\
  \ are teeming with cows, thousands of cows, and though they may be content to stand\
  \ still staring at nothing, the likelihood is that mad Old Farmer Frack will come\
  \ bellowing and waving his stick and drive them back and forth across the railway\
  \ line for his own, no doubt profound, purposes. He is not a farmer who can be bribed,\
  \ so if he is doing his thing with the cows, the train just has to wait.\n\nFrom\
  \ Blister Lane we head on to Hoon. There are many who contend that Hoon is a place\
  \ of myth, like Atlantis or Lemuria. Even if they are right\u2014and remember, there\
  \ is no definitive evidence either way\u2014that is no reason Hoon cannot have its\
  \ own railway station. The station itself shimmers, as if in mist, even on a clear\
  \ day, and eerie sounds echo about its turrets and crenellations, for the station\
  \ building is both turreted and crenellated, if blurry. It is not advisable to disembark\
  \ from the train at Hoon.\n\nNor is it a good idea to alight at the next stop, the\
  \ Horrible Cave, unless you are an emboldened spelunker. Actually, there is a reasonable\
  \ chance you may be so, for last time we did a readership survey it turned out that\
  \ almost three-quarters of Hooting Yard readers have survived terrifying imperilment\
  \ in caves, though not of course in the Horrible Cave itself. And it has to be said\
  \ that the Horrible Cave is so horrible that it makes every other cave in any given\
  \ subterranean system seem like a Prudence Foxglove Sunday School. The branch line\
  \ volunteers refused to place any health and safety notices at the stations, even\
  \ here, so you will have to keep your wits about you and use that unfashionable\
  \ tool, common sense. But if you are a regular reader of Hooting Yard, you will\
  \ of course have plenty of that.\n\nAnd so we steam on, still creaking, to the Macabre\
  \ Village. Please note that this is not the Macabre Yet Goofy Village you may have\
  \ read about in the works of Jean-Claude Unanugu, nor the same writer's Goofy But\
  \ Macabre Village. Those are fictional. This is just a macabre village, with no\
  \ goofiness to be found, however hard you might search. If you jump off the train\
  \ here, try not to go too close to any of the buildings, and take a torch with you,\
  \ the more powerful the better. In fact, take a torch and a bag of pebbles. You\
  \ can throw the pebbles at anything macabre that looms out of the shadows intent\
  \ upon attacking you.\n\nAnybody with any sense will have stayed on the train, and\
  \ be rewarded by arriving some hours later at The Ponds. This used to be a popular\
  \ destination for picnicking parties, particularly the pond known as Stagnant Inky-Black\
  \ Fathomless Spooky Pond, where generations of tinies cavorted and capered. Some\
  \ of them even made it home alive.\n\nFrom The Ponds it is a short hop to Pang Hill,\
  \ where the famous Orphanage graveyard is well worth a visit. Take a cotton napkin\
  \ to mop up your tears. Various mawkish pamphlets are available from the graveyard\
  \ gift shop, including some insufferably dreary collections of verse by Dennis Beerpint,\
  \ penned (as he would say) before his reinvention as a twenty-first century beatnik.\
  \ On that point, it appears that our cherished poetaster has disavowed his earlier\
  \ work. He issued some kind of manifesto the other day declaring that he intends\
  \ to rewrite each and every one of his pre-beatnik poems in the beatnik style. Whether\
  \ or not that is something to look forward to I am not sure. It might be a good\
  \ idea to snap up as many of his twee verses as you can while you are at Pang Hill,\
  \ if you can cease sobbing and do a Winslety gather.\n\nThe next stop is Pointy\
  \ Town. The station is, of course, magnificent, and very pointy. Indeed, it is thought\
  \ to be the pointiest railway station on the planet. Before reopening the branch\
  \ line, the volunteers made a special effort to eradicate any blunt bits on the\
  \ station concourse, using a sort of antisandpaper, supplies of which they found\
  \ untouched in a basement storeroom of Hubermann's, the gorgeous department store.\n\
  \nAnd so, finally, to the benighted fishing village itself, O'Houlihan's Wharf.\
  \ For obvious reasons, the timetables are less than accurate, but you should arrive\
  \ within two or three weeks of setting out from Hooting Yard. You will be exhausted,\
  \ and your head will be enveloped in steam, but you will I hope experience a Lovecraftian\
  \ shudder as you step on to the platform, with the sudden, hideous realisation that\
  \ there is no way back, and you must spend the rest of your days trudging up and\
  \ down the rotting jetty, befouled seawater sloshing against your boots, and squalls\
  \ blowing in from the west.\nNOTE\_: Signage by OSM, to whom many thanks. The picture\
  \ of the train on the cover of the brochure is from Agence Eureka.\n[2009-02-23]"
