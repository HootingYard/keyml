text: "Lars and Maud went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.\nLars fell down and\
  \ clonked his crown and Maud came tumbling after.\nThey rolled and tumbled further\
  \ down, tumbling pell mell,\n\u2018Til they came bumping to a halt down in the dingly\
  \ dell.\nIn the dell lurked the Grunty Man, who carried them off to his cave.\n\
  But fear not, tinies! For Lars was bold and Maud was very brave.\nThey shook their\
  \ little fists and bawled and rent the sky asunder,\nAnd made the Grunty Man commit\
  \ a very foolish blunder.\nHe dropped them at the cave-mouth while he went to have\
  \ a fight,\nAn illegal boxing match under the cover of the night.\nThe Grunty Man\
  \ was pitted \u2018gainst an awful, dreadful foe \u2013\nNone other than Miss Peep,\
  \ affectionately known as \u201CLittle Bo\u201D.\nShe looked so pale and timorous,\
  \ yet she packed a hefty punch,\nAnd often bashed a dozen ogres before she had her\
  \ lunch.\nSo when the Grunty Man stalked off to meet his Nemesis,\nLars and Maud\
  \ ran off into the arms of Alger Hiss.\nYes, Alger Hiss, the communist spy from\
  \ Washington DC!\nUrbane and droll and stylish, dressed up to a T.\nHe took the\
  \ tots to a meeting of his fellow-travelling Reds,\nWhere Stalinist propaganda turned\
  \ their pointy little heads.\nThey went back to the cave and found the Grunty Man\
  \ covered in gore.\nLittle Bo Peep had bashed him up, then bashed him up some more.\n\
  They recruited him to their cause, to overthrow the state.\nSaid Lars (or Maud)\
  \ \u201CWe must act before it is too late!\u201D\nSo Lars and Maud and the Grunty\
  \ Man went back to the dingly dell,\nAnd hid some microfilmed secrets at the bottom\
  \ of the well.\nBut they were caught by Nixon, indefatigable in his zest\nTo place\
  \ as many Reds as possible under house arrest.\nHe confined them to a house atop\
  \ the hill they climbed for water,\nA solid and a sturdy house well built from bricks\
  \ and mortar,\nLike the house of the three little pigs that withstood lupine huff\
  \ and puff.\nBut Lars and Maud and the Grunty Man were Communists, sure enough.\n\
  So when the big bad wolf hove into view from o'er the hills,\nThey sang in praise\
  \ of Stalin and then swallowed their cyanide pills.\nAnd so the state was safe once\
  \ more from Communist infiltration,\nAnd Nixon was bathed in the praise of a relieved\
  \ and grateful nation.\nThe Grunty Man and Lars and Maud were buried and forgot.\n\
  But Richard Milhous Nixon\u2014he is not.\n[2011-04-23]"
