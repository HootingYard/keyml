  \ apace. Now, in addition to this very Hooting Yard you are reading, the radio show\
  \ and the vast archive of podcasts available from ResonanceFM, he has found another\
  \ berth on what our Flemish pals call het internet. Very sensibly, the quintet of\
  \ indefatigable blogpersons who have created The Dabbler\_: A Culture Blog have\
  \ invited your favourite impoverished scribbler to occupy his own cupboard there.\n\
  \nPostages will be placed in Key's Cupboard once a week, probably on Fridays, and\
  \ include a mix of brand new stuff written exclusively for The Dabbler and forgotten\
  \ items long buried in the Hooting Yard archives.\nSo hie ye over there right now,\
  \ and make sure you read all the other interesting dabblings. (I particularly recommend\
  \ the item about the Cobham Cuckoos.)\n[2010-07-30]"
