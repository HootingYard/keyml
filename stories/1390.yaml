text: "It can be the devil of a job to keep a pigtape sated. The standard pigtape\
  \ has three basic behaviours: grunting interminably until it is fed, eating the\
  \ food it is given, and, mercifully, taking post-prandial naps. One learns to treasure\
  \ those naps, for they are the only respite one gets from the pigtape. Even then,\
  \ it tends to grunt and snuffle and wheeze in its sleep, so it still makes a noise,\
  \ though not as horrible a noise as its incessant grunting for food when awake or\
  \ the absolutely disgusting chomping and slobbering noises it makes when it is eating.\
  \ It is fortunate that the pigtape is such a tiny being, and the volume of its noises\
  \ commensurate with its size, otherwise one would be deafened by it, and not merely\
  \ deafened but driven from polite society, banished to a wilderness. Most pigtapes\
  \ are audible only to their hosts, which is a bad enough state of affairs.\nThe\
  \ correct term is \u201Clittle pigtape\u201D and it is similar to a tapeworm, except\
  \ that the pigtape dwells within the soul. This does not mean that the pigtape grunts\
  \ for spiritual sustenance, such as the reading of books by Deepak Chopra. The food\
  \ for which it grunts is all too solid\u2014cream crackers and cockles and mussels\
  \ and lemon meringue pie and bloaters and choc ices and cous cous and pastry and\
  \ vinegar and a spit-roasted half of an ox and aubergines and dumplings and suet\
  \ pudding, to name but a baker's dozen of its cravings. Before at last it is replete\
  \ and takes a noisy nap, the little pigtape somehow sucks all the food out of your\
  \ stomach through internal piping to its cranny in your soul.\nBecause it is so\
  \ tiny, and dwells within so inaccessible a spot, ridding oneself of a pigtape is\
  \ well nigh impossible. Maybe not even well nigh, but just impossible, full stop.\
  \ Certainly there are no recorded cases in the literature of anything resembling\
  \ a little pigtape being extracted from a body, either during a surgical procedure\
  \ upon the living or an autopsy upon the dead. Nor is it at all clear how one acquires\
  \ a pigtape in the first place. We all have our sacred souls, but not all souls\
  \ provide a home to these minuscule grunting greedy monsters. It is not true, despite\
  \ what you may have had drummed into you by priests or parents, that the presence\
  \ or absence of a pigtape is dependent in some way upon one's moral unbesmudgement.\
  \ Of course, it is advisable not to eat too much contaminated pork, but for a host\
  \ of other reasons, such as indigestion or death.\n[2009-01-11]"
