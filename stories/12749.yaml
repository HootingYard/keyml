text: "To a great many people, and I am here to say that I am one of them, a seaside\
  \ resort cannot stake a great claim on interest or affection unless it has a pier.\
  \ More perhaps than speeches or proclamations, the one fact that convinced many\
  \ Englishmen in 1940 that the nation was really up against it was when detachments\
  \ of Royal Engineers at every resort and with precision blew great gaps in our beloved\
  \ piers so that they could not be used as landing stages by the Germans then threatening\
  \ seaborne invasion.\nThis affection for the pier can be doubtless proved to have\
  \ psycholgical implications, particularly to any Freudians left in the audience.\
  \ That rigid object penetrating the loved or hostile ocean from the anchorage of\
  \ the land\u2014well, as long as you know how to spell phallus you can barely go\
  \ wrong.\nAnthony Hern, The Seaside Holiday\_: The History of the English Seaside\
  \ Resort (Cresset 1967)\n[2014-05-25]"
