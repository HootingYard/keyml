text: "I am going to have jam today. I had no jam yesterday, or for several days before\
  \ that, and I think it is very unlikely that I will have jam tomorrow, or for the\
  \ foreseeable future. The precise extent of the foreseeable future is, of course,\
  \ a matter of conjecture. Some people have the attention span of a gnat and can\
  \ foresee little more than the next few seconds, if that. Then there are seers and\
  \ wizardy persons, who can foretell, or at least claim to foretell, events that\
  \ occur far into the future. Nostradamus is perhaps the most famous example, but\
  \ there are others, such as those boffins who concoct long-range weather forecasts.\
  \ Between the gnat-brained and the seers are the vast majority, the rest of us,\
  \ who can make reasonable guesses at what might occur a few days or even a few weeks\
  \ hence, according to our appointment diaries. I know, for instance, with a reasonable\
  \ degree of certainty, that in a couple of weeks\u2019 time I will, touch wood,\
  \ be visiting a hospital to see a consultant to find out what he has learned from\
  \ a study of a sample of my precious blood. Yet it remains possible that this will\
  \ not happen, for reasons mundane\u2014a rescheduling of the appointment\u2014or\
  \ dramatic\u2014the hospital collapses to ruin in an earth-shuddering cataclysm.\
  \ So even the foreseeable future may not be wholly foreseeable. Of one thing I can\
  \ be sure, and that is the fact that I will have jam today.\nI intend to spread\
  \ it, the jam, on a slice of toast, possibly two slices of toast depending on the\
  \ amount of jam and the liberality, or miserliness, with which I spread it. I might\
  \ even eke out three toast-slices\u2019 worth, if I go a bit mad. I know I will\
  \ have the jam today. From where I sit, if I crane my neck at a certain angle and\
  \ peer intently through my spectacle-lenses, I can see the jam, in a small plastic\
  \ container with a tear-off lid, resting on the countertop anent the electric toaster\
  \ in which I shall be toasting the slices of bread. Will, shall \u2026 the future\
  \ tense. Can I really be sure I will have the jam? Could something happen, mundane\
  \ or dramatic, to prevent what might otherwise seem inevitable? With the jam in\
  \ my possession, now, could it yet happen that I will not, after all, have jam today?\
  \ To which the only conceivable answer is, alas, yes.\nI might discover, when tearing\
  \ off the lid of the container, that the jam is contaminated, and gives off a foul\
  \ reek, and must at once be consigned to the dustbin. Or, in a variant of the anomalous\
  \ phenomenon of spontaneous human combustion, there may be an inexplicable occurrence\
  \ of spontaneous jam combustion, and I will be left with not jam but cinders. All\
  \ sorts of other eventualities, the likely and the unlikely, are feasible. The only\
  \ way I can guarantee having jam today is to cease writing, right this second, and\
  \ make my toast, and spread my jam, and eat it. So that is what I shall do, and\
  \ I will report back.\n\nMission accomplished. I had jam today! Hurrah hurray! Though\
  \ it is only fair to say that it tasted far less toothsome than I had hoped. It\
  \ was bland jam. Tomorrow, I hope instead to have marmalade. But it is best not\
  \ to hope too desperately, for who knows what might occur, before the sun rises\
  \ tomorrow, to crush my marmalade desire?\n[2014-12-04]"
