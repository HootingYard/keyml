  \ buzz in the industry as we approach the launch of the latest version of one of\
  \ the most popular games on the planet, a multibillion-dollar money-spinner instantly\
  \ recognisable from the three letters GWD.\nI am speaking, of course, of Grovel\
  \ With Dampier, the cardboard and chickenwire strategy game that numbers among its\
  \ fans Yoko Ono, Dale Winton, President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov of Turkmenistan,\
  \ and Stephen Fry. I have been fortunate enough to get a sneak preview of version\
  \ four and, let me tell you, it is everything it's cracked up to be.\nAs with the\
  \ earlier releases, the basic concept of Grovel With Dampier is deceptively simple.\
  \ Sorry, that's not quite right. There's no deception involved. It is simple! You,\
  \ the player, accompany a simulacrum of buccaneering sea captain Sir William Dampier\
  \ (1651\u20131715) on his three circumnavigations of the globe. Every now and again,\
  \ you both disembark from your ship, whether it be the Cygnet, the St George, or\
  \ the Duke, and grovel in the stinking, muddy tidewaters of whichever land mass\
  \ you are at the edge of. Then, your hair festooned with kelp and your eyes sore\
  \ from salt water, you clamber back on to your ship and voyage onwards to seek further\
  \ grovelling grounds.\nAficionados will be pleased to learn that most, if not all,\
  \ of the irritating additional features have been removed from this new edition,\
  \ allowing players to concentrate fully on the essence of the game. There is no\
  \ distracting music, no bleeps and blips and high resolution graphics, just a sheet\
  \ of cardboard and some chickenwire and the opportunity to pretend you really are\
  \ grovelling with Dampier. Does it get any better than this?\n[2008-05-01]"
