text: "Y is for Yachtsman\nSome years ago, were one strolling in a marina or a harbour,\
  \ it would be quite common to hear a bunch of tinies chanting a rhyme as they danced,\
  \ hand in hand, in a ring around a collapsed and comatose seaside sot.\nSee the\
  \ drunken yachtsman, vomit on his blazer / It is Mijnheer Bl\xF6tzmann, zap him\
  \ with your Taser!\nThere are several problems with this, and we are indebted to\
  \ Arturo Himmelfarbarb, the noted collector of children's gruesome seaside songs,\
  \ who recently published a research paper in which he tabulates the perplexities\
  \ on an abstruse graph, with pointy bits and no doubt expensive four-colour printing.\
  \ As is the way with good old Arturo, a draconian embargo has been placed on the\
  \ graph, so I cannot reproduce it here. Instead, I will do my best to summarise\
  \ the points he makes, using plain words rather than exciting graphic hullabaloo.\n\
  First, Bl\xF6tzmann is given the Dutch honorific \u201CMijnheer\u201D, in spite\
  \ of the fact that all the available evidence suggests he was Swiss. Though there\
  \ have been arguments, of deathly tedium, questioning his nationality, nobody has\
  \ ever claimed Bl\xF6tzmann was a Netherlander, or even a Belgian. As for the so-called\
  \ \u201CAfrikaaner Cradle-In-The-Nursery Conjecture\u201D, that nonsense was comprehensively\
  \ demolished long, long ago, by yours truly, on primetime television no less, thanks\
  \ to the good offices of Russell Harty.\nSecondly, Bl\xF6tzmann was famously teetotal,\
  \ and never allowed a drop of spiritous liquor to pass his lips. The idea that he\
  \ would be found lying ruined by drink at a marina is laughable. It is true he was\
  \ fond of the sea, which he memorably described as \u201Cthat soaking wet immensity\
  \ stretching to the horizon and beyond\u201D, and often skulked about ports and\
  \ harbours and quaysides and marinas, doing his Bl\xF6tzmanny doings, but those\
  \ doings were always done sober, have no doubt about that. To which one might add\
  \ that his love of coastal purlieux did not extend to the sea itself, for he was\
  \ a boat-scared man all his life. That he would ever have gone yachting is inconceivable.\n\
  In a different section of his fantastic graph, Arturo demonstrates that at the time\
  \ the children's ditty was recorded, the Taser had not yet been invented. In those\
  \ days, if one wanted to fell a malefactor, one used a club or a bludgeon. The Taser\
  \ itself, in its initial form, dates from 1974, the year of Potus Richard Nixon's\
  \ disgrace and resignation.\_In any case, as the upper right segment of the graph\
  \ demonstrates with admirable clarity, one needs neither Taser nor club nor bludgeon\
  \ to subdue a sot in a coma whose collapse is due to his having glugged an unconscionable\
  \ amount of hooch.\nIn sum, then, the rhyme makes no sense whatsoever. Hot-brained\
  \ Gallic postmodernist Jacques Postmod has attempted to \u201Cundo\u201D, as he\
  \ puts it, Arturo's tremendous diagram, but nobody takes him seriously anymore,\
  \ thank heaven.\nWhich all goes to show that the life can be sucked out of even\
  \ the jauntiest children's chant when the leeches of academe are properly applied.\n\
