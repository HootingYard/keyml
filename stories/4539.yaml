  \ The sort of people who think \u201Cprima donna\u201D is spelled, and means, \u201C\
  pre-Madonna\u201D and who are indeed wholly ignorant of almost everything that happened\

  \ Yard readers who he is.\n\nRingo was visiting the Chelsea Flower Show this week.\
  \ A snap appeared in the Telegraph. The caption? \u201CRingo Starr, the narrator\
  \ of Thomas the Tank Engine, with his wife Barbara Bach at the Chelsea Flower Show\
  \ 2010.\u201D [My italics.]\nCruel it may be, but one is tempted to force these\
  \ nitwits to listen to \u201COctopus's Garden\u201D over and over and over again,\
  \ until the cows come home.\n[2010-05-28]"
