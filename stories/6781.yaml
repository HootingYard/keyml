text: "The Times, February 16, 1855\nConsiderable sensation has been evoked in the\
  \ towns of Topsham, Lympstone, Exmouth, Teignmouth, and Dawlish, in the south of\
  \ Devon, in consequence of the discovery of a vast number of foot-tracks of a most\
  \ strange and mysterious description. The superstitious go so far as to believe\
  \ they are the marks of Satan himself; and that great excitement has been produced\
  \ among all classes may be judged from the fact that the subject has been descanted\
  \ on from the pulpit.\nIt appears that on Thursday night last there was a very heavy\
  \ fall of snow in the neighbourhood of Exeter and the south of Devon. On the following\
  \ morning, the inhabitants of the above towns were surprised at discovering the\
  \ tracks of some strange and mysterious animal, endowed with the power of ubiquity,\
  \ as the foot-prints were to be seen in all kinds of inaccessible places\u2014on\
  \ the tops of houses and narrow walls, in gardens and courtyards enclosed by high\
  \ walls and palings, as well as in open fields. There was hardly a garden in Lympstone\
  \ where the foot-prints were not observed.\nThe track appeared more like that of\
  \ a biped than a quadruped, and the steps were generally eight inches in advance\
  \ of each other. The impressions of the feet closely resembled that of a donkey's\
  \ shoe, and measured from an inch and a half to (in some instances) two and a half\
  \ inches across. Here and there it appeared as if cloven, but in the generality\
  \ of the steps the shoe was continuous, and, from the snow in the centre remaining\
  \ entire, merely showing the outer crest of the foot, it must have been convex*.\n\
  The creature seems to have approached the doors of several houses and then to have\
  \ retreated, but no one has been able to discover the standing or resting point\
  \ of this mysterious visitor. On Sunday last the Rev. Mr. Musgrave alluded to the\
  \ subject in his sermon, and suggested the possibility of the foot-prints being\
  \ those of a kangaroo; but this could scarcely have been the case, as they were\
  \ found on both sides of the estuary of the Exe.\nAt present it remains a mystery,\
  \ and many superstitious people in the above towns are actually afraid to go outside\
  \ their doors after night.\n* Read concave.\nQuoted in Sober Truth\_: A Collection\
