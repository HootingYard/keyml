text: "\u201CIn the mediaeval imagination, this was a region of uttermost dread\u2026\
  \ where the heavens fling down liquid sheets of flame and the waters boil\u2026\
  \ where serpent rocks and ogre islands lie in wait for the mariner, where the giant\
  \ hand of Satan reaches up from the fathomless depths to seize him, where he will\
  \ turn black in face and body as a mark of God's vengeance for the insolence of\
  \ his prying into this forbidden mystery. And even if he should be able to survive\
  \ all these ghastly perils and sail on through, he would then arrive in the Sea\
  \ of Obscurity and be lost forever in the vapours and slime at the edge of the world.\u201D\
