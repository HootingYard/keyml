text: "What with all this book research, Hooting Yard is taking on a rather neglected\
  \ air, I'm afraid. But a man can only write so much, even Mr Key!\nWhat is happening\
  \ at the moment is that instead of sitting down with my goose-quill and my parchment\
  \ and painstakingly inscribing sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose for the elves\
  \ in the cellar to tap out on a keyboard and post on Het Internet, instead of that\
  \ more or less daily routine I have devised a quite different routine, which involves\
  \ browsing through various dusty tomes on the creaking bookshelves of Haemoglobin\
  \ Towers, winnowing from them choice snippets about the lives and absurdities of\
  \ persons part and present. Persons such as, to pluck an example at random . . .\n\
  Peary, Robert (American explorer, 1856\u20141920). Peary had idiosyncratic views\
  \ on how best to survive the harsh polar climate. On his expeditions, he never slept\
  \ in a tent, preferring to remain out in the open with his dogs. He chewed frozen\
  \ chunks of pemmican (concentrated fat and protein) rather than cooking it.\nToday\
  \ I have also added to my manuscript Britney Spears, Cecil B. DeMille, the ornithologist\
  \ and aviator Angelo d'Arrigo, and the tearaway son of Edward G. Robinson, among\
  \ others. No wonder by this time of day (just after 8.00 PM) my wits are addled.\
  \ (Actually, they were addled simply from considering the activities of Angelo d'Arrigo,\
  \ but you will have to wait for the book to come out to find out about him.)\nSo\
  \ I am going to do my best to inject a bit of vitamin-enhanced vim \u2018n\u2019\
  \ verve into Hooting Yard, but I hope you will bear with me. Of course one way to\
  \ hasten my completion of the book so we can all get back to blessed normality is\
  \ for you lot to send me your own choice snippets of odd and unlikely biographical\
  \ flapdoodlery (with a note on sources).\n[2013-10-22]"
