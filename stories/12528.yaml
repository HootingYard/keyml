text: 'Keen Hooting Yardist Ruthie Bosch drew to my attention the Stith Thompson Motif
  Index of Folk Literature, or more precisely the index to that Index. That was a
  week ago, and I am still trying to reorient my brain to take account of its existence.
  The world has changed for me, irrevocably. To give some idea of what I am babbling
  on about, you lot should listen, immediately, with lugholes alert, to today''s episode
  of Hooting Yard On The Air, in which I took the opportunity to read (most of) the
  Stith Thompson Index index for Bird.
