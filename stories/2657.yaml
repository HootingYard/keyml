text: "I was about to begin tippy-tapping a piece entitled Bad Gas And Forts, with\
  \ no clear idea in what direction it might go, nor of much beyond the title itself,\
  \ when it struck me how many years, indeed decades, that phrase has been lodged\
  \ in the pea-sized yet pulsating Key cranium.\nSometimes I wonder if all the main\
  \ lineaments of my prose were present in my teenage, indeed pre-teenage, brain.\n\
  There was a time, in the seventies, when I created, on paper, a number of bands.\
  \ These being the days before punk, my phantom line-ups included players of the\
  \ cello and bassoon and theremin as well as guitar, bass and drums. I devised album\
  \ and track titles and liner notes\u2014much as I have done in recent years for\
  \ Vril, to my continuing astonishment\u2014and wrote record and concert reviews.\
  \ Weirdly, I don't think anyone ever read these teeming pages of an alternative\
  \ musical universe except me\u2026 and I wonder if indeed I ever read them (as opposed\
  \ to writing them) myself. Doubly phantom, then, unread words of an unreal world.\n\
  Nearly everything I wrote between the ages of eight and, oh, twenty-two or twenty-three\
  \ is lost, swept away and gone. Some of it may even have been burned. This is probably\
  \ a good thing. I suspect I would not be the only one to cringe at some of the adolescent\
  \ twaddle.\nAnd yet, every so often, \_fragments from the past come twinkling to\
  \ the fore, such as, from 1973 or thereabouts, the invented album by an invented\
  \ band whose invented name I can no longer recall. The album was entitled Bad Gas\
  \ And Forts, and it was a masterpiece.\n[2009-07-20]"
