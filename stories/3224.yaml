text: "I was pondering, so you wouldn't have to, the Great Helmsman's weird parallel\
  \ universe speech at the Labour Party conference last week. In particular, I found\
  \ myself chewing over what on earth he was talking about when he referred to \u201C\
  new modern technicians\u201D. Who are these people? Are they replacements for old,\
  \ has-been technicians? Can an old has-been strive to become new and modern?\nBecause\
  \ I have read widely in that seam of gibberish mined so profitably by De Bono and\
  \ Buzan, I was able to enjoy a flash of insight. Recently, I mentioned overhearing\
  \ a reference to a \u201Cvisionary cobbler\u201D. It seems to me that the visionary\
  \ cobbler and the new modern technician are one and the same. No ordinary cobbler,\
  \ bound by old has-been cobbling ways, the visionary cobbler is\u2014by dint of\
  \ that very visionariness\u2014new and modern and cobbling away in that bright sunlit\
  \ upland our leader described for us so majestically.\nIn this paradise, which is\
  \ probably a fool's paradise, but none the worse for all that, new modern visionaries\
  \ ply their trades while, behind the scenes, feral teenage tearaway mothers are\
  \ corralled into hostels and council officials obliterate every last scrap of antisocial\
  \ behaviour Latin.\nIt is not just cobblers whose lives have been transformed by\
  \ the new vision. Lamplighters, bootblacks, night soil men, wrights of all kinds,\
  \ tally-stick tappers, shovelmen, kiters, branglers and fleemsters, all these have\
  \ swept away their old has-been cobwebs and emerged as new, and very modern, and\
  \ indeed, technical.\nI have seen the evidence with my own eyes. Down the lane from\
  \ me there is a kiosk occupied for as long as I can recall by a boot-mender. Those\
  \ whose boots were broken would take their boots to him, and, for a few shillings,\
  \ he would mend them, if not as good as new then at least with one or two fewer\
  \ gaping holes or patches of distressed stitching. This was quite clearly an old\
  \ has-been way of doing things. Now, the kiosk has been covered in new modern plastic\
  \ logos and the boot-mender himself has a new slick hairstyle and trendy spectacles,\
  \ and his old crumpled beige overalls have been replaced by a stylish outfit, in\
  \ mauve and teal, with clean lines, and a laminated namebadge. He is now, one might\
  \ say, a visionary cobbler. And I for one am blissfully happy that, instead of simply\
  \ getting my boots repaired, I am given a personalised and computer-readable boot\
  \ health-check, together with a coupon for a complimentary plastic beaker of fruit\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 fibre \u2018n\u2019 seeds \u2018n\u2019 plumstones \u2018n\u2019\
  \ curly kale juice from the brand new kiosk next door.\nOnwards and upwards with\
  \ the new modern technicians and the visionary cobblers!\n[2009-10-04]"
