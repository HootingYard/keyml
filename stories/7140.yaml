text: "There are many details to savour in the story of the Bavarian cow fugitive,\
  \ not the least of which is that the cow is named Yvonne and her sister is Waltraut.\
  \ Clearly the dairy farmers of Bavaria have a grasp of cow nomenclature second to\
  \ none. I am also fascinated by Franziska Matti, the Swiss \u201Canimal communication\
  \ expert\u201D who is in telepathic communication with Yvonne, and says:\nI spoke\
  \ to her yesterday and she said that she was fine but didn't feel ready to come\
  \ out of hiding. She said she knew that Ernst had been waiting for her but that\
  \ she was scared. She said she thought that humans would lock her up and she would\
  \ no longer be free.\nI would be greatly interested to learn in what language Ms\
  \ Matti and Yvonne speak to each other. Does Ms Matti moo, or does the telepathic\
  \ realm grant Yvonne a smattering of German? Also, with all of Bavaria seemingly\
  \ agog with the thrill of the hunt, intent either on rescuing Yvonne or shooting\
  \ her down, how could Ms Matti be sure that the cow with which she was in mystic\
  \ mental contact was actually Yvonne, and not, say, Waltraut, or Ernst, or any of\
  \ thousands of other Bavarian dairy cows? If she remained in her fastness in Switzerland\
  \ while sending out telepathic signals, her ability to pinpoint Yvonne is truly\
  \ remarkable. One wishes, however, that Ms Matti had asked the simple question,\
  \ \u201CWhereabouts are you, Yvonne?\u201D With an answer to that, we could be sure\
  \ that we were hearing from Yvonne herself and not from some telepathic impostor\
  \ cow intent on muddying the waters, with a motive either benign or, more likely,\
  \ malign.\nI suppose telepathic communication with cows knows no national boundaries,\
  \ but I do wonder how much work comes Ms Matti's way. Do dairy farmers throughout\
  \ Europe come a-hammering at her door whenever one of their cows goes astray? And\
  \ is she able to use her powers to speak to other farmyard animals, such as goats\
  \ or hens or pigs? What about non-farmyard animals, giraffes, for example, ostriches,\
  \ ants, and axolotls? Does she speak to these in their own tongue, for want of a\
  \ better word, or can they all speak telepathic German?\nThere is much left unsaid\
  \ in the newspaper report, so I may have to fire off a letter to Franziska Matti,\
  \ or, better yet, attempt to communicate with her over the mystic aether. I shall\
  \ do my best to make my thoughts heard over the telepathic hubbub of mooing and\
  \ bellowing and cooing and grunting of her other communicants.\n[2011-08-17]"
