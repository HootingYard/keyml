text: "Warning by Jenny Joseph is, apparently, Britain's best-loved postwar poem.\
  \ It is said to be \u201Clife-affirming\u201D. Pah! Who needs life to be affirmed\
  \ when, as Dr Malcolm said, and as we all know, \u201Clife will find a way\u201D\
  ? Anyway, let's take a look at the poem, shall we?\nWhen I am an old woman I shall\
  \ wear purple\nWell, I am not a woman, but I am old, and I'm not wearing purple.\
  \ I am not Erik Satie, for god's sake.\nWith a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't\
  \ suit me.\nThe only people who habitually wear red hats are cardinals of the Roman\
  \ Catholic Church. At the time of writing, women, whether old or young, are not\
  \ allowed to become priests, let alone cardinals, so there is some kind of cognitive\
  \ dissonance going on here.\nAnd I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves\
  \ / And satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.\nThis demonstrates a complete\
  \ misunderstanding of Bismarck's domestic policy in late 19th\_century Germany.\
  \ It was guns before butter, not brandy and gloves and footwear. What sort of nation\
  \ state can you expect to build if everybody totters around in a stupor brought\
  \ on by spiritous liquor, decked out like the most foolish of New Romantics?\nI\
  \ shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired\nActually, that's fair enough. So\
  \ that line can stand. But only that one, so far.\nAnd gobble up samples in shops\
  \ and press alarm bells / And run my stick along the public railings / And make\
  \ up for the sobriety of my youth.\nNo you bloody well won't, because you're slumped\
  \ on the pavement, or preferably in the gutter, remember? You're far too tired to\
  \ get up and start charging around the place as described here, because your tiny\
  \ brain is exhausted from all that catch-up reading you've had to do to correct\
  \ your misunderstanding of German history.\nI shall go out in my slippers in the\
  \ rain / And pick flowers in other people's gardens /And learn to spit.\nNobody\
  \ learns to spit. You just spit. In any case, whether learned or innate, if you\
  \ spit and steal you will get an Asbo, and so you should. Carry on, and you'll be\
  \ banged up in a large concrete building with iron bars on the windows and made\
  \ to sew mailbags until you die, whereupon you'll be buried in an unmarked grave\
  \ over which quicklime will be poured to hasten your dissolution. (I may have an\
  \ outmoded view of prison conditions, but a man can dream.)\nYou can wear terrible\
  \ shirts and grow more fat\nOh, so all of a sudden this is about me? It's all very\
  \ well casting aspersions upon my majestic dress sense etcetera from behind prison\
  \ walls, but I'm not the one forced to wear a rough sackcloth uniform covered in\
  \ arrows and withering away on a bread and water diet. (See above re: prison conditions.)\n\
  And eat three pounds of sausages at a go\nYes, thank you, I will eat as many sausages\
  \ as I like. That line can stand.\nOr only bread and pickle for a week\nYou don't\
  \ understand German history, and you don't listen. I have no idea where you get\
  \ the idea there might be pickles on the menu. See above\u2014bread and water, not\
  \ bread and pickle.\nAnd hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.\n\
  Stationery is fine, but you won't need a beermat for your rusty beaker of water,\
  \ and what in heaven's name are these \u201Cthings\u201D in boxes? Lovecraftian\
  \ monsters with suckers and antennae? You've got another thing coming if you think\
  \ they'll stay happily boxed up. As soon as you turn your back they will burst from\
  \ their confines and latch on to your throat and drain the lifeblood from you, what's\
  \ left of it. And they will make an absolutely terrifying noise while they do so.\n\
  But now we must have clothes that keep us dry / And pay our rent and not swear in\
  \ the street / And set a good example for the children.\nPure wishful thinking,\
  \ given that you are sprawled on the cold stone floor of your prison cell with a\
  \ hideous alien being that defies all known organic lineaments wrapped around your\
  \ neck sucking your blood and slowly, slowly crushing the last breath out of you.\n\
  We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.\nBy \u201Cthe papers\u201D I\
  \ assume you mean those academic papers about Bismarck that you ought to have been\
  \ reading when you still had the chance. Too late, too late.\nBut maybe I ought\
  \ to practise a little now?\nNo.\nSo people who know me are not too shocked and\
  \ surprised / When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple.\nYeah, yeah, and\
  \ I'm Erik Satie. Get a grip, for god's sake.\nThus we are left with two lines of\
  \ clarity from all this delusional twaddle:\nI shall sit down on the pavement when\
  \ I'm tired / And eat three pounds of sausages at a go\nAnd that can be cut to make\
  \ it more punchy:\nI shall sit down\_ / And eat sausages\nNow that is a poem the\
  \ nation can be proud of!\n[2010-07-02]"
