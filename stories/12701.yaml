text: "Last night I dreamed of Sir Maurice Bowra (1898\u20141971). When I awoke, this\
  \ morning, I had to look him up to find out who he was. When I went to sleep last\
  \ night, his was a name I knew, that I had come across here and there over the years,\
  \ but I could not have said I knew anything about him.\nI learn, today, among other\
  \ things, that he wrote\_: \u201CI expect to pass through this world but once and\
  \ therefore if there is anybody that I want to kick in the crutch I had better kick\
  \ them in the crutch now, for I do not expect to pass this way again.\u201D\nIn\
  \ my dream Bowra was hanging about on the street wit a man named Henderson and a\
  \ third party whose name was not divulged. Bowra had lank sandy hair and looked\
  \ not unlike the actor David Warner. But in reality, he was \u201Cbuilt like a sandbag,\
  \ \u2026 short and square with no neck and possessed a huge bittern booming voice\u201D\
  . This is what he really looked like.\n\n[2014-05-01]"
