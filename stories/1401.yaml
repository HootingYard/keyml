text: "According to the Press Association, Scientists will serve gruel to the public\
  \ today after recreating the porridge made famous by Oliver Twist. Members of the\
  \ Royal Society of Chemistry produced the recipe, consisting of water, oats and\
  \ milk, after consulting historic sources as well as Charles Dickens\u2019 novel.\
  \ The Victorian workhouse staple, which will be prepared by French chef Fabian in\
  \ the society's kitchen, will be ladled into pewter dishes and served to passersby\
  \ at 11am by the society's own \u201CBeadle\u201D at the entrance of its London\
  \ home at Burlington House, Piccadilly. An RSC spokesman said: \u201CDiners asking\
  \ for more will be rejected.\u201D\nSadly, I read this too late to be able to get\
  \ to Piccadilly in time for my free pewter pot of gruel. I could console myself,\
  \ however, that it would not have been a new experience for me. I think I have mentioned\
  \ elsewhere that I spent a period, earlier in my life, subsisting on a diet of gruel.\
  \ This was not for reasons of ill-health or a traumatised digestive system or even\
  \ abject poverty. My flatmate at the time and I undertook the gruel-only diet as\
  \ an experiment in asceticism, puritanical fanaticism, and self-righteousness. Indeed,\
  \ as I read the Press Association report it struck me that the RSC recipe seems\
  \ rather luxurious, adding a slop of milk to the oats and water. No such treats\
  \ for us!\nMy grueldom took place many years ago, early in the Thatcher administration,\
  \ but the lessons I learned then, and the stiffening of my moral fibre, have remained\
  \ with me. In fact, whenever the opportunity arises, I like to announce that \u201C\
  I lived on a diet of gruel, you know,\u201D to whomsoever is listening. Curiously\
  \ enough, this is almost invariably met by laughter and ridicule.\n[2009-01-13]"
