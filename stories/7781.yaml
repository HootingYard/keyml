text: "The whole point of this advent calendar hoo-ha is that we are counting towards\
  \ the celebration of the birth of sweet baby Jesus. Later, grown to mangodhood,\
  \ Jesus asserted that \u201CI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh\
  \ unto the Father, but by me\u201D, so it may be considered inappropriate to include\
  \ a picture of a rival god in our calendar. But that's just what we're going to\
  \ do here at Hooting Yard, inspired by the spirit of diverse vibrancy, or vibrant\
  \ diversity, or whatever it is they inculcate into tinies in their community education\
  \ hubs these days.\nHere, courtesy of Bushwick Policy, is a Mayan bat-god, eerily\
  \ similar to the hideous bat-god Fatso.\n\n[2011-12-05]"
