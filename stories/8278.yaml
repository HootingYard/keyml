text: "Last April I posted a plea for help. For thirty years I had been incapable\
  \ of deciphering part of the lyric of Capitalist Music's titanic masterpiece \u201C\
  Jane's Gone To France\u201D. Several readers tried, but failed, to work out what\
  \ on earth the great Steve Bloch was harping on about, and were equally as baffled\
  \ as me.\nNow, out of the blue, someone called Matt has added to the comments on\
  \ that post, and provided the answer. And of course, when you listen to the song\
  \ again, knowing what Matt has told you, it seems absolutely clear, and indeed obvious.\n\
  I doubt that any of you care very much, but this has made me happy. Thank you, Matt.\n\
