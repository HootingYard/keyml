text: "I do not often contribute to the Comments threads on blogs. Whether this is\
  \ a character flaw or a virtue I am not sure. Probably it is sheer idleness. However,\
  \ up bright and early this morning I turned to Peter Hitchens\u2019 latest postage\
  \ over at the Mail Online, and came upon this sentence:\nSeeing several of [Mary\
  \ Renault's] books at bargain prices, I stuffed them in my backpack and began reading\
  \ (as it happened) \u2018The King Must Die\u2019 as I waited for a delayed train\
  \ on a country platform.\nI could not let this pass without comment. So I commented:\n\
  Mr Hitchens\_: I really must take issue with your use of the word \u201Cbackpack\u201D\
  . It ill becomes you. \u201CBackpack\u201D is a barbaric neologism used by young\
  \ persons, often those on so-called \u201Cgap years\u201D. In future, please ensure\
  \ you use one of the three\u2014yes, three!\u2014acceptable alternatives, \u201C\
  rucksack\u201D, \u201Chaversack\u201D, or\u2014my personal preference\u2014\u201C\
  knapsack\u201D.\nThese words of wisdom are awaiting moderation, but I hope to see\
  \ them appear soon. Peter Hitchens is one of the few mainstream press bloggers who\
  \ engages fully, indeed robustly, with his readers, so I also hope to see his grovelling\
  \ mea culpa before too long.\n[2010-07-01]"
