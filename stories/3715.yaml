text: "Reader Fitzmaurice Trenery has been studying very carefully number one in our\
  \ series of Notable Authors Sitting On Swans, and has reached a startling conclusion:\n\
  \u201CMr Key\_: Contrary to the description of the photograph, it seems to me that\
  \ it depicts the wondrous accidental meeting of two benighted creatures, the swan-headed\
  \ child and the child-headed swan. See how they embrace, each chimera recognising\
  \ in the other his own misery. The chin of the newly-confident child-headed swan\
  \ seems to jut in new-found defiance of the world! I'm not sure if a beak can jut,\
  \ so I shall reserve judgement on the swan-headed child\u2014in any case it seems\
  \ to me an altogether more ambiguous character. Such a firm grip on the child-headed\
  \ swan's neck; I infer here the crafty sense in the swan-headed child's tiny bonce\
  \ that it is the benefactor of this symbiotic relationship. After all, the swan-headed\
  \ child may be dextrous and bipedal, but it is led around by a pea-sized brain.\
  \ The child-headed swan, for its part, has a fey, ethereal beauty\u2026 but when\
  \ the head matures into adulthood the neck will be powerless to support it, and\
  \ what then? What then?\u201D\nThough I would swear by the crumpled cloth of Anaxagrotax's\
  \ winding-sheet that the snap does indeed show Raymond Roussel as a tiny, so forceful\
  \ and convincing is Mr Trenery's argument that I am putting the series on hold pending\
  \ further investigations. I have it in mind to employ for the purpose Agence Goron,\
  \ the detective agency commissioned by Roussel to find and negotiate with an illustrator\
  \ to provide the drawings for New Impressions Of Africa (1932).\n[2010-01-21]"
