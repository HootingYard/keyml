text: "\nHow infuriating that the site of one's d\xE9bilit\xE9 sociale is located,\
  \ so precisely, low down at the back of the head! This makes it extremely difficult\
  \ to deal with, when one eventually gathers sufficient courage\u2014moral and physical\u2014\
  to do something about it. Whether one intends to tweak it with tweezers, modify\
  \ it with blows from a hammer, or wrench it out entirely with a pair of pliers,\
  \ its position makes any approach fraught with difficulties, difficulties which\
  \ may prove insuperable to the sufferer from d\xE9bilit\xE9 sociale in particular.\
  \ Why on earth did God make us in so cack-handed a manner?\nAn array of mirrors,\
  \ precisely angled, will go some way to helping us, but mirror-reflections can be\
  \ notoriously misleading, particularly to those who are optically stupid. Reflections,\
  \ and reflections of reflections, and reflections of reflections of reflections,\
  \ and so forth depending upon the number of mirrors in one's array, can baffle the\
  \ brightest, and it is not the brightest we are talking about here.\nAdd to that\
  \ the dexterity required to deploy one's tweezers or hammer or pliers at the back\
  \ of one's bonce without doing oneself a mischief and one can appreciate how perilous\
  \ the process is certain to be. What was the Lord thinking?\nAn alternative of course\
  \ is to accept one's d\xE9bilit\xE9 sociale for what it is, and carry on regardless.\
  \ But therein lie even greater disasters, what with one thing and another, to all\
  \ intents and purposes, speaking in the round, as my old father-confessor used to\
  \ say, or rather whisper, lugubriously, in his box, after Mass, when the weight\
  \ of my sins grew too much to bear, and I went to see him, for absolution, and for\
  \ tips on the proper usage of tweezers and hammers and pliers, which, being that\
  \ rare thing, a practical priest, he was ever happy to divulge, albeit with equal\
  \ lugube. Spirit and matter were as one to him. He had not the merest tinct of d\xE9\
  bilit\xE9 sociale. At least, I do not think he did, but then I cannot recall ever\
  \ seeing the back of his head.\n(Drawing of head\u2014not the father-confessor's\u2014\
