  \ it, wear a sweeping black cape, and apply some mascara around your eyes. Doing\
  \ so will add a dash of mystique and make you seem a little more exotic than you\
  \ are already. If you have no family, and few friends, you can drag some mendicants\
  \ and urchins and dogs off the street.\nThe trick can only be performed on a sunny\
  \ day, for to begin you need to position yourself in such a way that you are standing\
  \ in a shaft of sunlight beaming through your window into an otherwise gloomy room.\
  \ This shaft of light will make visible motes of dust dancing in the air around\
  \ you. The OED defines a mote as a particle of dust, esp. one of the innumerable\
  \ minute specks seen floating in a beam of light. There are several other definitions\
  \ of mote, but that is the one I am talking about. Dust, meanwhile, is given as\
  \ earth or other solid matter in a minute and fine state of subdivision, so that\
  \ the particles are small and light enough to be easily raised and carried in a\
  \ cloud by the wind; any substance comminuted or pulverized; powder. Again, the\
  \ dictionary gives other meanings of dust, including that to which anything is reduced\
  \ by disintegration or decay; spec. the \u2018ashes\u2019, or mouldered remains\
  \ of a dead body. Note that I am not for one minute suggesting that you should perform\
  \ this astounding magic trick while engulfed in a cloud of the dust to which some\
  \ close relative, say your Ma or your wan tubercular sister, has recently been reduced.\
  \ If you are grieving for one not long departed, whether it be your Ma or your sister\
  \ or anybody else, you should probably not be trying to do conjuring tricks, even\
  \ as a way of perking yourself up. Grief is grief, and must run its course, as any\
  \ number of books in the self-help section of your local library will tell you,\
  \ even in this day and age. You may search fruitlessly, in your library, for a work\
  \ of literature or history or science, but I am told that the shelves still heave\
  \ with self-help books of all kinds, especially ones with a television tie-in.\n\
  Make sure you are standing within the shaft of sunlight erect and resolute. Do not\
  \ hunch your shoulders, or slouch, and try not to topple over. If you are the sort\
  \ of person who tends to topple, because you are overwhelmed by the sheer weightiness\
  \ of existence, shore yourself up with something. Metal poles, artfully placed,\
  \ can keep even the weediest of neurasthenics upright, at least for long enough\
  \ to perform this trick.\nExplain to your audience that you are going to astound\
  \ and amaze them. Speak in a booming voice resonant with melodrama. If you are incapable\
  \ of producing sufficiently booming and melodramatic sounds, hire a ventriloquist,\
  \ who can be hidden somewhere within the gloom. Do not be disheartened if any members\
  \ of your audience chuckle, or titter, or even guffaw. That will be a reflection\
  \ upon them, not upon you. They will, I would wager, be chuckling or tittering or\
  \ guffawing due to nerves, nerves strained to snapping point in anticipation of\
  \ the eldritch forces you are about to unloose. Meet any laughter with a cackle\
  \ of your own, or of your ventriloquist's, and make it a fiendish cackle, but do\
  \ not overdo it.\nNow it can happen, especially in a climate such as ours, that\
  \ a sudden cloud will scud across the sky and occlude the sunlight, thus rendering\
  \ the motes of dust around you much less visible. If your room is sunk in particular\
  \ gloom, the motes of dust may not be visible at all, and you yourself may be but\
  \ a shadow in the murk, and a blurred shadow at that, to those of your audience\
  \ whose ocular faculties are pitiable. It is imperative that you keep their interest\
  \ until the cloud passes and the shaft of sunlight beams once again upon you. Whip\
  \ out a banjo or a ukulele and launch into an Appalachian folk song, preferably\
  \ one with innumerable verses but a less-than-compelling narrative, so that you\
  \ can play and sing for as long as necessary, but break off as soon as the sunlight\
  \ returns, even in the middle of a verse, without disappointing your audience. Some\
  \ people find it difficult to play stringed instruments while wearing sweeping black\
  \ capes. I have never quite understood this, but apparently it is something to do\
  \ with movement of the arms being hampered by the cape. If you are affected by this\
  \ problem, try tucking the cape behind your back, or pick an Appalachian folk tune\
  \ that requires only desultory strumming so that you need not move your arms too\
  \ much.\nIt may be that the cloud blocking the sunlight is a harbinger of further\
  \ clouds, even of a completely overcast sky, and that a torrential downpour will\
  \ begin. That would not be surprising in this land. Now, while such a turn of events\
  \ may leave you crushed, and in no wise able to perform the astounding magic trick\
  \ due to the lack of a shaft of sunlight beaming through your window, it has the\
  \ advantage that your audience will almost certainly wish to remain indoors. True,\
  \ some of them may have come armed with sou'westers and mackintoshes and galoshes,\
  \ and be willing to trudge back across the fields in the pelting rain, but the likelihood\
  \ is that most will stay with you, for though you and they are enshrouded in gloom,\
  \ it is at least dry gloom. I assume, of course, that you do not have gaping holes\
  \ in your roof through which the rain comes in and forms puddles in the dents of\
  \ your floor. If your repertoire of Appalachian folk songs is scanty, and you have\
  \ exhausted it before the rainfall ceases, you will need to devise some other form\
  \ of entertainment for your guests. This is where the ventriloquist, if you have\
  \ hired one, can be a godsend. Even if he or she has not brought their usual dummy\
  \ with them, it is a simple enough matter to bundle a few rags together into a puppet.\
  \ While the ventriloquist is keeping your audience spellbound, you can familiarise\
  \ yourself with a few more Appalachian folk songs using speed-learning techniques\
  \ picked up from a self-help book.\_ Between the two of you, it ought to be child's\
  \ play to keep your audience entertained for hours and hours, by which time, even\
  \ in this country, the sun should shine once more. On the other hand, if you have\
  \ a booming and melodramatic voice, and saw no need to hire a ventriloquist, things\
  \ might get a bit ugly once your store of Appalachian folk songs has dried up. This\
  \ is particularly the case if among your audience you have persons with short tempers,\
  \ low boredom thresholds, or those on day release from the nearby secure clinic\
  \ for the criminally insane. In these circumstances, it will be well if you have\
  \ borrowed from the library a self-help book such as How To Pacify Enraged Audiences\
  \ Who Were Expecting A Conjuring Trick But Were Fobbed Off With Appalachian Folk\
  \ Songs Followed By An Eerie Silence.\nBut let us be optimistic, and hope that that\
  \ scudding cloud was no more than a fugitive visitor, and that the sun shines brightly\
  \ once more. Cast aside your banjo or ukulele and make a couple of sweeping gestures\
  \ with your cape. Ensure, as you do so, that nobody in the audience gets a glimpse\
  \ of the badger concealed within its black folds. Now, ask one of their number to\
  \ step into the shaft of sunlight with you and to lend you their hat. On very, very\
  \ rare occasions, not a single person in the audience will be a hat-wearer, but\
  \ this need not concern you. You will have taken the precautionary measure of planting\
  \ a stooge with a stovepipe hat among your guests. Should nobody else volunteer,\
  \ this person now leaps up, with enthusiasm yet without betraying that the pair\
  \ of you are old muckers who go way, way back. You take the stovepipe hat from him,\
  \ and, using sleight of hand, insert the badger into it. It is absolutely crucial\
  \ that no one sees you do this. You then place the hat on your stooge's head and\
  \ tell him to return to his seat, or stool. At this point, do some flummery for\
  \ a minute or two. Then, with an air of distraction, as if it is an afterthought,\
  \ ask your stooge to take his hat off. To the audience's amazement, he will do so\
  \ to reveal a badger asleep upon his head! To resounding applause, go and collect\
  \ the badger. Remember that you will need to pump it full of antidote fairly soon\
  \ to rouse it from the coma induced by the serum with which you injected it earlier.\n\
  You can then pass your own hat around, upturned, to collect any coinage which your\
  \ stunned audience wishes to give you in gratitude for so thrilling a magic trick.\
  \ A proportion of any monies collected should of course be spent on a treat for\
  \ the badger.\n[2009-03-09]"
