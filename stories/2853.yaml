text: "There are difficult days, like today, when I awake in the grip of the fever.\
  \ My ablutions are performed hurriedly, as if there is no time to waste, even though\
  \ it is still before dawn. If I can face breakfast, I bolt it, like a half-starved\
  \ squirrel alighting upon a single discarded nut on the lawn of a municipal park.\
  \ I pace up and down, disconsolate, muttering, eyes popping, my hair dishevelled\
  \ and with beetles falling from it. I wander through the chartered streets and see\
  \ in every face I meet signs of the same restlessness, signs of the same phrenzy.\
  \ Aimless and distracted I return home. My limbs are aquiver but I snap them to\
  \ stillness and manage to make a pot of tea. I turn on the kitchen radio and tune\
  \ in to Tugboat Crew Playtime, hoping the tunes will soothe my brain. I feel as\
  \ if there is a nest of vipers squirming in my vitals, but eventually I gather.\
  \ I gather. And I walk as boldly as I can across the hall and push open the living\
  \ room door and I look down\u2026\nAnd of course, it is fine. It is perfectly serviceable.\
  \ A tad worn in places, a faded stain here or there, but nothing I cannot cope with.\
  \ And thus does my carpet madness evaporate, and I am human again, no longer a demented\
  \ thing.\nI had resigned myself to these periodic attacks, but now it seems help\
  \ is at hand. If my carpet madness gets worse, there is a remedy. According to the\
  \ North Korean Central News Agency,\nProducts of the Pyongyang Carpet Factory are\
  \ drawing interests of many people at home and abroad.\nThe factory, with a long\
  \ history of carpet production, is producing various kinds of hand-woven carpet,\
  \ machine-woven carpet and others to suit the world trend.\nIt is located in Sosong\
  \ District of Pyongyang.\nPak Won Chol, director of the factory, said in an interview\
  \ with KCNA to the following effect: The factory is making silk carpet good for\
  \ health and longevity which the Korean ancestors had long used and wool carpet\
  \ giving comfortable feeling.\nA doctor once told me he thought my own \u201Cepisodes\u201D\
  \ of carpet madness were brought on by a neurotic terror that my carpet did not\
  \ suit the world trend. If that is indeed the cause, then I now know how to conquer\
  \ the bonkersness once and for all.\nThanks to Mick Hartley for the link.\n[2009-08-12]"
