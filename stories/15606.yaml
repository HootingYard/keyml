text: "\nThe communist regimes of the last century threw up their fair share of monsters,\
  \ among whom Pol Pot was one of the more demented. His Khmer Rouge came to power\
  \ in Cambodia in 1976. By the time they were overthrown, three years later, around\
  \ a quarter of the population had perished.\nPol Pot had a vision of a sort of peasant\
  \ utopia. Accordingly, towns and cities were emptied and the people marched out\
  \ into the countryside to work on collective farms. He had a particular animus towards\
  \ \u201Cbourgeois intellectuals\u201D, a group which apparently included anybody\
  \ who wore glasses. Of course, surprise surprise, Pol Pot was such an \u201Cintellectual\u201D\
  \ himself. As a young man, he studied in Paris, from 1949 to 1953.\nThere is an\
  \ instructive story from his time in France. Already the first glimmerings of his\
  \ agrarian revolution were swirling around in Pol Pot's brain, and an associate\
  \ suggested he ought to get out of Paris and investigate French farming methods.\
  \ Pol Pot thus headed off, deep into rural France, and went to stay\u2014uninvited\u2014\
  with a dairy farmer.\nFor a couple of days, the future tyrant followed the farmer\
  \ about, observing him at work. This, it seemed, taught Pol Pot all he needed to\
  \ know. On the third day, over breakfast, he launched into a Marxist critique of\
  \ the farmer's age-old rustic ways. He could, he explained, order the cows to do\
  \ exactly as they were told, just as he would go on to bend the people of Cambodia\
  \ to his will. The wise old French farmer scoffed.\n\u201CYou do not understand,\u201D\
  \ said Pol Pot, never short on self-belief, \u201CYour cows will obey my every word.\
  \ For I speak the language of cows!\u201D\nThe farmer chuckled at the young Cambodian\
  \ upstart, took a last sip of his breakfast brandy, and went out to his barn. He\
  \ opened the doors, and the cows mooched off across his fields to munch grass.\n\
  At this point, Pol Pot appeared at his side. He announced that he would make all\
  \ the cows return to the barn tout suite, simply by issuing a verbal diktat. He\
  \ then uttered, at deafening volume, a strange guttural Cambodian cow incantation.\
  \ To the farmer's astonishment, the cows ceased munching, looked up, and, at almost\
  \ uncanny speed, charged across the fields and returned to the barn.\nIt was a classic\
  \ case of Pot calling the cattle back.\n[2017-09-05]"
