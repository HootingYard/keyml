text: "Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup is a delicious soup from the Carpathians,\
  \ perfect for those long winter evenings as darkness falls and the temperature plummets\
  \ and a chill sets in to your bones. It is very simple to make. Basically, you just\
  \ boil up a pan of potatoes and sausages and add a suitable coagulant. When it is\
  \ thick enough for your iron spoon to stand up in it unsupported, tip the whole\
  \ lot into a bowl and garnish with the horns of a goat or two, for added crunch.\n\
  In the past, entire Carpathian families lived off this soup for years on end. It\
  \ is true that in some cases they suffered from nutritional\u2026 difficulties,\
  \ and had many ructions with the Carpathian goat-herding community, but we live\
  \ in a different age, and can put such unpleasantness behind us. There is no benefit\
  \ whatsoever in reviving ancient Carpathian blood feuds, although of course to do\
  \ so can enliven an otherwise dull week.\nIf you are worried by the prospect of\
  \ a gang of Carpathian peasants hoving into view armed with flaming torches and\
  \ pitchforks, call our helpline. Our staff have been fully\u2014well, adequately\u2014\
  trained in Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup dispute resolution techniques,\
  \ and will not hang up if they hear you screaming for mercy.\n[2009-10-29]"
