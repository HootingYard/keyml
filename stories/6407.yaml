text: "\nThis week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I launch an exciting new series in\
  \ which I dispense free online legal advice to the unwashed masses. Our first topic\
  \ is bonkers alibis. There is, I am told, a body of opinion that reliable legal\
  \ advice is best sought from qualified practitioners who have devoted a number of\
  \ years to study of the law. There is some merit in this view. Unfortunately, if\
  \ I took it seriously, I would not be in a position to dispense legal advice of\
  \ any sort, and that would never do, would it? I like nothing better than to stand\
  \ on street corners haranguing passers-by with legal tips, through a loudhailer\
  \ if necessary, or even a tannoy, whether those passers-by are in need of the advice\
  \ or not. After all, the day may come when they will need it, hoit cum toit, tolly\
  \ polly, rinkum dinkum.\nIt is also worth pointing out that you may benefit from\
  \ deep textual study of my legal tips even if you are not a member of the unwashed\
  \ masses, for example if you are the sort of person who bathes occasionally and\
  \ shuns human company, aloft in your ivory tower. Such persons are still placed\
  \ under arrest, rightly or wrongly, particularly if Detective Captain Cargpan is\
  \ in a bad temper, as he so often is, when he has not roughed somebody up for a\
  \ few hours. Why, only the other day I heard tell of a fellow, an inhabitant of\
  \ an ivorian turret given to preening upon his balcony spitting upon and hurling\
  \ anathemas at the unwashed masses gathered below at the foot of his turret, with\
  \ their pitchforks and stink. Up the spiral staircase lumbered Cargpan and his toughs,\
  \ and they bashed this chap about and dragged him off to the nick, where they bashed\
  \ him about some more before charging him with several obscure crimes most of us\
  \ thought had been removed from the statute book, such as \u201Cleaning against\
  \ his own mantelpiece\u201D and \u201Chaving an oddly-shaped head\u201D.\nOf course,\
  \ I knew these were still heinous acts of criminality, even though I have never\
  \ studied the law. My knowledge comes from having memorised Dobson's pamphlet How\
  \ To Fill Your Brain With Arcane Legal Precepts Through Simple Will-Power And Osmosis\
  \ (out of print). The ivorian turreteer did not, alas, retain me as his legal advocate,\
  \ and that is why he is now serving twenty thousand years in Sing Sing, or in the\
  \ Pointy Town equivalent of Sing Sing, which is called something like Bing Bang\
  \ or Ping Pong or Whiff Whaff. It is not to be confused with the thrilling sport\
  \ of the same name, played with light little white balls and bats. The bats are\
  \ not white, though they are fairly light and fairly little, when compared, say,\
  \ to big bats like bludgeons, the ones Detective Captain Cargpan issues to his ruffians\
  \ on the morning of an arrest. Nor are these the same bats that hang upside down\
  \ in caves and flit and swoop and occasionally become entangled in the hair of screeching\
  \ girlies in certain genres of film.\nI hope from the above it is clear that I have\
  \ an enviable grasp of many matters, legal and otherwise, and therefore can almost\
  \ always be relied upon when dispensing advice, in The Dabbler and elsewhere.\n\
