text: "CLUBFOOTED TOT WINS HEROISM CUP. This was the headline on the front page of\
  \ the Daily Brouhaha that first brought Tiny Enid to national attention. Until then,\
  \ her heroic exploits were known only to a few. Her intervention in the case of\
  \ the gormless nipper changed all that, at least for a while, until a fad or frippery\
  \ came along to divert the fickle public. Yet some of us have not forgotten the\
  \ heroic infant, and it is important that a new generation be reminded of her deeds.\n\
  The gormless nipper was roughly the same age as Tiny Enid, and of roughly the same\
  \ diminutive stature, but otherwise the pair of them might have inhabited different\
  \ planets. Where Tiny Enid was heroic, the nipper was gormless. Where Tiny Enid\
  \ showed valour, gusto, and dash, the nipper was gormless, gormless, gormless.\n\
  The nipper was raised in an orphanage not unlike Pang Hill Orphanage. It was a monstrous\
  \ black brick building crumbling upon a hillside. One winter's day, the gormless\
  \ nipper was leaning out of a window gazing gormlessly at the sky when he fell,\
  \ landing in a gormless heap in the snow. Instead of trudging back to the huge iron\
  \ door of the orphanage and rapping his tiny fist upon it until the kindly matron\
  \ let him back in, the gormless nipper wandered off, away from his grim black brick\
  \ home, ever further away, until he was quite lost. Thus began a series of accidents\
  \ and misadventures which befell him due to his gormlessness. Stopping to rest at\
  \ a level crossing, his cravat was singed by sparks from a passing locomotive. When\
  \ he made to untie the cravat to look more closely at the singeing, he half-strangled\
  \ himself and lost consciousness. Swooning, he fell forward so that the very top\
  \ of his head almost touched the railway track, and when a second locomotive thundered\
  \ past seconds later he received an inadvertent haircut, his locks torn out by the\
  \ screeching metal train wheels. Had he had a mirror when he awoke from his swoon,\
  \ the gormless nipper would have seen that he now had the appearance of a tonsured\
  \ friar. He roamed onwards, crossing the tracks, and fell into a pond. Minuscule\
  \ aquatic beings within the pond attached themselves to his skin and burrowed through\
  \ to his innards, where they fed upon his tissue and squirted out pond-venom. They\
  \ were microscopic beings (actual size), so the gormless nipper was unaware of their\
  \ parasitic sucking and squirting, and the amounts of pond-venom were so infinitesimally\
  \ small that even the most advanced scientific apparatus would be unable to detect\
  \ them. Nevertheless he began to feel off colour and when, eventually, the venom\
  \ reached his brain it had the effect of increasing, rather than alleviating, his\
  \ gormlessness.\nThe nipper slept that night in a byre, surrounded by cows. Discovered\
  \ at dawn by a florid-faced farmer, he was set to work pulling a plough through\
  \ a field. The winter sun blazed on his tonsure and turned the snow to slush, and\
  \ by the time he was done ploughing, the nipper's socks were soaking wet. He took\
  \ them off and hung them up to dry on what he thought was a washing line. Alas,\
  \ it was an electricity cable running from the farmer's generator to a new-fangled\
  \ power spade, and the gormless nipper was jolted by a shock of sufficient voltage\
  \ to make him queasy. So when, shortly afterwards, the farmer fed him a bowl of\
  \ soup, he vomited it up all over the freshly laundered farmyard kitchen tablecloth,\
  \ an heirloom embroidered with unbelievable delicacy by the farmer's great great\
  \ grandmother. Understandably furious, the farmer kicked the gormless nipper all\
  \ the way down the lane into the village square at Scroonhoonpooge and abandoned\
  \ him there.\nDazed and sore, still queasy, and with the pond-venom coursing through\
  \ his vitals, the gormless nipper slumped against a plinth. The village beadle found\
  \ him there, tonsured and sockless and with sick on his sleeves, and accused him\
  \ of defiling the statue of frizzy-haired minstrel Leo Sayer atop the plinth, which\
  \ was the pride of the village. Thrown into a dungeon, the nipper slept fitfully\
  \ that night in the company of mice and beetles.\nThe next morning, the beadle handed\
  \ the gormless nipper over to a brute to whom he would be apprenticed for the next\
  \ six months. Day in, day out, the brute sent the nipper to the bottom of the sea\
  \ in his bathyscaphe, from where he had to plunge into deep sea trenches and collect\
  \ bioluminescent organisms. The goggles of his diving suit did not fit snugly, and\
  \ the gormless nipper gradually began to lose his sight. When he was almost blind,\
  \ the brute rowed him out to sea and left him marooned on a whelk-encrusted rock.\n\
  And there he may have perished were it not for Tiny Enid. One day, eager to do a\
  \ heroic deed, she sailed aloft in her hot air balloon and spotted the gormless\
  \ nipper weakly trying to prise the very last whelk from the rock. Rightly judging\
  \ that he was far too puny and famished to hoist himself up any rope she might dangle\
  \ down to him, Tiny Enid set her burners roaring and ascended high enough to snare\
  \ a cumulet. Tying a quickly-scribbled message to the bird's leg, she propelled\
  \ it in the direction of the Air Sea Rescue Station at St Bibblybibdib, then descended\
  \ again until she was in shouting distance of the gormless nipper.\n\u201CFear not,\
  \ nipper!\u201D she cried, \u201CI am Tiny Enid and I have alerted the Air Sea Rescue\
  \ Station at St Bibblybibdib to your sorry plight by attaching a message to the\
  \ leg of a cumulet. The bird is flying its little heart out even as we speak, and\
  \ soon a lovely big lifeboat will scud across the waves to rescue you. Preserve\
  \ your energy, and stop trying to prise that last whelk from the rock, for soon\
  \ you will be sitting at my kitchen table wolfing down a slap-up hot dinner of non-seafood\
  \ items!\u201D\nAnd so it was that, nine months to the day since he had fallen from\
  \ the orphanage window into the snow, the gormless nipper returned to his grim black\
  \ brick home. He was driven there by Tiny Enid herself, in a hired charabanc, on\
  \ the day after she was awarded a tin cup for heroism. The gormless nipper had managed\
  \ not to be sick all over Tiny Enid's tablecloth, and a few eye drops from her mysterious\
  \ cabinet had restored his sight. The hair had grown back where it had been ripped\
  \ out by the locomotive, and his heroic rescuer selflessly gave him a pair of her\
  \ own socks to replace the ones still hanging neglected from the farmer's electricity\
  \ cable. Had Tiny Enid known that the nipper was riddled with microscopic aquatic\
  \ parasites squirting pond-venom, no doubt she would have found a way of exterminating\
  \ them. She was that kind of girl.\n[2007-11-01]"
