text: "It has been said that Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, bestrode the 20th\
  \ century like a colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself, when still\
  \ a young man. At the age of twenty, he published a pamphlet resoundingly titled\
  \ Why I Shall Bestride This Century Like A Colossus. It is a curious work, out of\
  \ print of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper swan on the cover. It\
  \ begins thus:\nI shall bestride this century like a colossus. My name will ring\
  \ out like a clarion. In years to come, whenever two or three are gathered together\
  \ to discuss pamphleteers, there will be but one name on their lips: Dobson!\nSuch\
  \ self-belief, in so callow a youth, is touching. Looking back, in his dotage, Dobson\
  \ found it touching too, and he took to sitting with his one remaining copy of the\
  \ pamphlet clutched to his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end. When\
  \ Marigold Chew found him thus, she flung open the windows, whatever the weather,\
  \ and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea shanties, ones that involved\
  \ pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sailcloth, salt, seaweed, hard tack biscuits,\
  \ foghorns, sirens, rigging, anchors, and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson's self-pitying\
  \ lassitude would be broken, and he would hurl the curiously pristine pamphlet towards\
  \ the fireplace, wipe away his tears, don his Bolivian military boots and his Stalinist\
  \ cardigan, and crash out of the house to go on one of his jaunts.\nDobson's jaunts,\
  \ in the latter part of his life, usually took him to the nearest pig sty, but there\
  \ was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far\
  \ that day that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets\
  \ had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other devised by\
  \ Yoko Ono as part of an art project to promote world peace. Postal delivery persons\
  \ in that city were required by law to learn all the double street names by heart,\
  \ or to face summary dismissal if they failed. Often, those who did fail\u2014and\
  \ there were many\u2014would flounce around on the outskirts of the city warning\
  \ travellers away. It was a paltry sort of revenge, and seldom succeeded, for the\
  \ delights of that shining city on a hill attracted wayfarers from near and far,\
  \ daily, in their thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before\
  \ this particular Tuesday.\nA dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of\
  \ print pamphleteer as he was about to cross a pontoon bridge that would take him\
  \ in to the most boisterous quarter of the city.\n\u201CGo no further, old man,\u201D\
  \ said this vengeful figure, whose yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles\
  \ and arteries beneath. His hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth\
  \ of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast\
  \ with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets\
  \ in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips.\
  \ His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any\
  \ variation in tone or cadence. \u201CThis city you approach is no place for out\
  \ of print pamphleteers.\u201D\nEver sensitive to warnings from spooks and wraiths,\
  \ Dobson turned around and went home. He found Marigold Chew in the back garden,\
  \ drilling holes in an enormous sheet of corrugated cardboard.\n\u201CI was warned\
  \ away from a shining city on a hill,\u201D he said, \u201CIs it a city you have\
  \ visited?\u201D\nMarigold Chew stopped drilling, reset the safety catch, and removed\
  \ her protective goggles.\n\u201CYou are a foolish old man in your dotage, Dobson,\u201D\
  \ she said, though there was kindness in her voice, \u201CAnd it is well you were\
  \ warned away, for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill it\
  \ sits atop is hollow, and harbours within it heaven, and some say hell. Either\
  \ way, I am pleased to see you home. Let us clear the nettles from the vegetable\
  \ patch.\u201D\nThat was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th\
  \ century. Did Dobson indeed bestride it as a colossus? He was not the only person\
  \ to think so, but the names of the others escape me for the time being. When I\
  \ remember them, I will tell you.\n\nThat piece, which first appeared almost exactly\
  \ five years ago today, has been chosen as a set text for the entrance examinations\
  \ to Bodger's Spinney Infant School. Here are some sample questions likely to be\
  \ faced by the tiny candidates:\n1. Imagine you are the dismissed postal delivery\
  \ person who encounters Dobson by the pontoon bridge. Would you have handled the\
  \ situation in the same way? Think about what you would have said to the out of\
  \ print pamphleteer, then translate it into Latin.\n2. Do you think Yoko Ono's unnecessary\
  \ double-naming of the streets in the shining city on the hill would make a significant\
  \ contribution to world peace? Give reasons for your answer in terse, cogent prose,\
  \ then translate that into Latin too.\n3. Give a brief account of the career of\
  \ David Blunkett, with special reference to his second resignation speech and tearful\
  \ use of the phrase \u201Cthe little lad\u201D. Or was that the first resignation\
  \ speech?\n4. If you could bestride a century like a colossus, which century would\
  \ you choose so to bestride, and why? Extra marks will be awarded if you turn pale,\
  \ gnaw the end of your pencil in desperation, and crumple to the floor, twitching\
  \ and shattered.\n[2012-10-04]"
