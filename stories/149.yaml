text: "You don't visit Hooting Yard to read about Paris Hilton, but there is something\
  \ magnificent about this story from yesterday's Guardian. I have emboldened the\
  \ most jaw-dropping passages:\n\u2026 the heiress and socialite yesterday appealed\
  \ to fans to sign an online petition urging California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\
  \ to commute her 45-day sentence for driving while disqualified. \u201CIf the late\
  \ former president Gerald Ford could find it in his heart to pardon former president\
  \ Richard Nixon after his mistake(s),\u201D reads the appeal, \u201Cwe undeniably\
  \ support Paris Hilton being pardoned for her honest mistake as well, and we expect\
  \ that the governor will understand and grant this unusual but important request.\u201D\
  \nMs Hilton, 26, was sentenced on May 5 after being pulled over while driving her\
  \ \xA3120,000 Bentley along Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, in February. Her licence\
  \ had been suspended for 36 months last year for driving while drunk. She had told\
  \ the judge she was not aware this meant she was unable to drive, since she never\
  \ read her own mail. \u201CI have people who do that for me,\u201D she said. \u201C\
  I just sign what people tell me to sign.\u201D\nThe letter to Mr Schwarzenegger\
  \ says Ms Hilton should be freed because \u201Cshe provides hope for young people\
  \ all over the US and the world. She provides beauty and excitement to (most of)\
  \ our otherwise mundane lives.\u201D\nMs Hilton's lawyers have filed notice of her\
  \ intent to appeal. Should that fail she will be required to present herself to\
  \ the women's prison in south Los Angeles on June 5. There she will share an austere\
  \ cell, wear an orange jumpsuit and pass the time with just three magazines or a\
  \ book, though she will be in a \u201Cspecial needs\u201D wing thanks to her celebrity\
  \ status.\n[2007-05-10]"
