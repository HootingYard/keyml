  \ In one of the few surviving photographs he appears in Russian army uniform, neatly\
  \ groomed, but with an intense, monastic appearance, like an Orthodox mountain hermit,\
  \ but near the end of his campaign he rode bare-chested, \u2018like a Neanderthal\u2019\
  , hung with bones and charms, his beard sprouting in all directions and his chest\
  \ smeared with dirt. He had gone from monk to shaman in a few years.\u201D\nBaron\
  \ Roman Nikolai Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg (1885\u20131921), as described by\
  \ James Palmer in his biography The Bloody White Baron (2008)\n\n[2009-10-29]"
