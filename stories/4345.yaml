text: "It's been a while since we paid a visit to the groovelab, high in the Swiss\
  \ Alps, where tireless boffins attempt to isolate the essential core of Hooting\
  \ Yard's grooviness. But we may have to pack our pippy bags and hike over there\
  \ again, for it appears that objections have been raised to the very practice of\
  \ grooving itself. Our dulcet-voiced South African correspondent Letta Mbulu has\
  \ found herself leaping to the defence of all things groovy by asking, in the form\
  \ of song, the cogent question What is wrong with grooving? Actually, Ms Mbulu asks\
  \ what is wrong with groovin\u2019, but I fear we ought not encourage her use of\
  \ apocopation, otherwise we start getting into Hootin\u2019 Yard territory, at which\
  \ point civilisation begins to crumble.\nI pause here briefly to note that Ms Mbulu's\
  \ name is an anagram of Umlaut Belt (or B\xEBlt), which is, as we know, the name\
  \ given to a far, far distant string of glittering stars and planets somewhere in\
  \ this or another galaxy, dubbed as such by a fearsome Teutonic astronomer great\
  \ of beard and brain alike. His own name, alas, I cannot quite recall. It is not\
  \ even on the tip of my tongue. It is as if it has been utterly expunged from my\
  \ memory, possibly by a bash on the bonce received when negotiating an Alp in Germany,\
  \ on my way to Switzerland, there to visit the groovelab boffins.\nI had my pippy\
  \ bag and my hiking apparel, and I had a handful of feed for any goats that might\
  \ cross my path as I wended my way. The sky was blue, and I thought of Ruskin. Well,\
  \ in truth I thought of both Ruskin and Letta Mbulu. I wondered, as I often have,\
  \ if Ruskin would have got down with the Hooting Yard groove, had he been born in\
  \ a different era. We tend not to associate Ruskin with grooviness of any kidney,\
  \ but that is a mistake, I think. It has not escaped my notice that his very name\
  \ suggests a Mbuluesque apocopation. What is wrong with Ruskin\u2019?, indeed.\n\
  Had I had my portable metal tapping machine upon my person upon that Alp, I may\
  \ well have pranged a message to Ms Mbulu, insisting that she make a new recording\
  \ of her song substituting Ruskin\u2019 for groovin\u2019. Not that this would have\
  \ gone down too well with the boffins in the groovelab, who I know consider Ms Mbulu\
  \ their staunch champion and her song their anthem. When your working day consists\
  \ of exhausting hours of experimental groovy research, it must be a terrific dampener\
  \ to learn that some are calling into question the practice of grooviness itself,\
  \ its tenets and ethics and its jib-cut. I was keen to speak with the boffins, to\
  \ see how they were bearing up, to spread some pep. Though I am often of lugubrious\
  \ mien, I am not averse to dispersing pep where and when I can, particularly among\
  \ boffins confined to their fastness in the Swiss Alps. I had gifts for them, too.\
  \ Stuffed into my pippy bag were samizdat copies of some of the more inspiring letters\
  \ from Ruskin's Fors Clavigera.\nSo there I was, toiling up an Alpine slope, on\
  \ the lookout for goats, thinking about Ruskin and Letta Mbulu, and nary a thought\
  \ in my head regarding the beardy brainy Teutonic astronomer who had named the Umlaut\
  \ B\xEBlt. Perhaps had it been night rather than day, had the broad sweep of the\
  \ heavenly firmament glittered in darkness above me, rather than the bronze and\
  \ battering sun, I might have thought about stars and planets and astronomers old\
  \ and new, Teutonic and otherwise, and that name I cannot now remember would have\
  \ come to me. Around it, I could have framed a piece of anecdotage to beguile the\
  \ boffins over lunchtime sandwiches in their canteen chalet. I would draw together\
  \ their singing heroine Letta Mbulu with the stars in a distant galaxy, somehow\
  \ work in Mr Ruskin, and then, la!, flip from my pippy bag the copies of Fors Clavigera\
  \ to boost their pep. Alas, it was not to be.\nAs I have indicated, I was well prepared\
  \ should I meet with any goats who crossed my path. I had handfuls of goat feed,\
  \ chiefly nettles and genetically modified sultanas and bran flakes, with which\
  \ to assuage them. What had not occurred to me was that, being Alpine goats, they\
  \ would be clumping about above the path, and, in a frisky moment, dislodge a rock\
  \ or two, which, rolling unstoppably down the slope, would land upon my bonce, and\
  \ knock me out.\nIt was night when I came to. Above me, the mighty firmament, the\
  \ stars in their courses glittering against a cloudless black expanse. Out there,\
  \ somewhere, possibly visible if I had a powerful telescope, was the Umlaut B\xEB\
  lt. What was it Dobson had written? Of all the belts in all the galaxies, the Umlaut\
  \ B\xEBlt can lay claim to being the grooviest belt imaginable. I wondered if the\
  \ boffins in the groovelab knew that. Try as I might, I could not remember the name\
  \ of that long dead Teutonic astronomer. I got to my feet. Strewn on the path, I\
  \ saw the untouched goat feed. Alongside it, my open pippy bag, and the few remaining\
  \ shreds of my copies of Ruskin's Fors Clavigera, chewed up and munched by the Alpine\
  \ goats which, like the rocks that had bedizened me, had descended from the slopes.\
  \ The goats were gone now, and my boffin-gift was gone too. I could hardly present\
  \ them with the sorry tatters which, in any case, a mountain wind would soon disperse\
  \ into the night. To arrive at the groovelab without a gift to pep the boffins would\
  \ be unforgivably ungroovy. Sadly, I turned around, and began the long hike back\
  \ to my homeland. I was in no mood for grooving. Perhaps I never would be, ever\
  \ again.\n[2010-04-27]"
