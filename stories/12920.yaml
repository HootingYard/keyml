text: "I have been thinking, as I sometimes do, about the ineradicable stupidity of\
  \ certain animals. These thoughts were prompted, today, by the newsagent's cat.\
  \ It really is a bewilderingly stupid cat. I then found myself pondering the blue-footed\
  \ booby, a bird which gives the impression of being as witless as any cat. The newsagent\
  \ does not have a pet booby, alas, so I had to make do with examining pictures.\n\
  \nA blue-footed booby. You already know what a cat looks like.\nI then began to\
  \ wonder which one is the more stupid, the cat or the booby. Surely the best way\
  \ to find out would be to pit one against the other in a (lack of) intelligence\
  \ test\u2014a \u201Cbrain-off\u201D between the newsagent's cat and a blue-footed\
  \ booby. Unfortunately, it was at this point that I learned\u2014by consulting my\
  \ copy of Dobson's Bumper Book Of Facts About Things The Lower Extremities Of Which\
  \ Are Blue (out of print)\u2014that the blue-footed booby is not native to these\
  \ shores. Apparently they are to be found from the Gulf of California down along\
  \ the western coasts of Central and South America to Peru.\nThe wonders of space\
  \ age technology mean that their far distant habitat need not deter me. All I need\
  \ is for a Hooting Yard reader resident in that part of the world to get hold of\
  \ a blue-footed booby and stick it in front of a computer. I will do likewise with\
  \ the newsagent's cat, and we can link up using Skype. We can then subject them\
  \ to a series of tests, the one against the other, cat versus booby, to determine\
  \ which one is the thickest.\nI will post an account of the contest, and its results,\
  \ as soon as we have managed to conduct it.\n[2014-08-03]"
