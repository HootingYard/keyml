text: "In a bold move, the colossally arrogant film director Horst Gack has bought\
  \ the rights to the much-loved cartoon character Unconscious Squirrel! The Unconscious\
  \ Squirrel, and is planning to feature it in his forthcoming adaptation of Sylvia\
  \ Plath's poem The Moon And The Yew Tree.\nThe film, with a working title of Unconscious\
  \ Squirrel! The Unconscious Squirrel In Sylvia Plath's The Moon And The Yew Tree\
  \ is to be shot entirely in Plath-O-gape-vision, an exciting new cinema technology\
  \ developed by Horst Gack's mysterious wife and collaboratrix Primrose Dent. According\
  \ to press releases, Plath-O-gape-vision will utterly transform the viewing experience,\
  \ rendering everything from action thrillers to comedies to submarine heist genre\
  \ movies into a uniform \u201Cblackness\u2014blackness and silence\u201D.\nProfessor\
  \ Dimity Cashew, an academic in the Department of Plathology at the University of\
  \ Ack, has been quick to point out that there are no squirrels, conscious or unconscious,\
  \ in the poem, only small bats and owls, and is fretful that Horst Gack's screenplay\
  \ will trivialise Plath's work. In an open letter to the director, posted on her\
  \ blog, she asks:\nHow are you going to insert a cartoon squirrel into your ill-advised\
  \ film treatment without doing violence to the legacy of Saint Sylvia?\nHorst Gack,\
  \ being Horst Gack, replied within thirty seconds, in a comment, or diatribe, longer\
  \ than Dr Cashew's original blog postage. Buried within lengthy paragraphs of invective\
  \ was this:\nThe squirrel is engulfed by Plath's fumy, spiritous mists, and lies\
  \ unconscious for the duration of the film (six and three quarter hours), partly\
  \ hidden by the row of headstones. I have been able to acquire the very same headstones\
  \ that were used in the graveyard scenes of Plan 9 From Outer Space starring Bela\
  \ Lugosi and his posthumous stand-in, though I need hardly point out that the production\
  \ values and aesthetic clout of my film will far surpass Ed Wood's cult classic.\n\
  A war of words has now broken out across the blogosphere. No doubt Horst Gack will\
  \ win the day, for we must remember that he has Primrose Dent at his side, and,\
  \ if sufficiently provoked, she will simply turn off the entire internet, as she\
  \ has threatened to do before, her impeccably manicured fingers poised over the\
  \ big black button on her uberconsole.\nThe film is due for release at some point\
  \ after the expiry of the ancient Mayan calendar in 2012.\n[2010-08-05]"
