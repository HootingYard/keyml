text: "During the last splutters of the Harold Wilson years, I had occasion to read\
  \ a slim book entitled Zen Buddhism, which consisted simply of a series of what\
  \ I think are called k\u014Dans, anecdotes or parables designed to assist one in\
  \ striving towards enlightenment. I do not recall any particular k\u014Dan in detail,\
  \ but they all seemed very similar, and tucked away in my memory there is a sort\
  \ of generic k\u014Dan, which goes something like this:\nOne day Bin-Bag was fishing\
  \ in a stream, and he caught a pike. He decided to take it to his Master as a gift.\n\
  \u201CHere, Master, I have brought you a pike,\u201D he said.\nBin-Bag's Master\
  \ took the pike, and then he picked up a stick and bashed his pupil about the head\
  \ with it.\n\u201COuch!\u201D wailed Bin-Bag. \u201CWhy are you hitting me when\
  \ I have brought you a pike?\u201D\nThe Master pushed Bin-Bag down a slope and resumed\
  \ his meditation. Bin-Bag rubbed his head and understood he was one step further\
  \ towards Enlightenment.\nI was young and impressionable, but even then I could\
  \ see that this was complete twaddle. Compared to Zen, Roman Catholicism seemed\
  \ sensible and coherent. I decided to have no truck with Eastern mysticism in future.\n\
  Years later, however, I was glad I had read the book. I was commissioned to write\
  \ a potted biography of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, and struggled to find an angle\
  \ from which to approach the subject. Then I realised that the witless k\u014Dans\
  \ provided an ideal model. I was able to scribble dozens of short yarns about the\
  \ Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, based on my faltering recollection of Zen k\u014Dans. The\
  \ only changes I had to make were to substitute the Zen Master's bashing and shoving\
  \ with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman's technique of making haphazard gesticulations at\
  \ a robin, or at a flock of sparrows, or, in extremis, when faced with a particularly\
  \ recalcitrant acolyte, wandering woozily off to a nearby kiosk to buy herself a\
  \ toffee apple.\nAnd that brings us smartly to the end of our alphabet.\n[2010-10-06]"
