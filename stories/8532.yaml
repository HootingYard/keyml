text: "I once had the unnerving experience of meeting, at a cocktail party in an Alpine\
  \ skiing resort, a real, living and breathing chairlift dingbat. To say I was flabbergasted\
  \ is an understatement. Like most people, I believed that the Alpine chairlift dingbat\
  \ was a figure of myth, a boogie man of whom tales were told to frighten the tinies.\
  \ But no. Here he was, leaning against a mantelpiece, nursing a glass of sfizziggio,\
  \ telling amusing anecdotes to a rapt audience.\nI turned to my companion and hissed,\
  \ \u201CYou cannot seriously expect me to believe that this charming and insouciant\
  \ fellow is a chairlift dingbat?\u201D\nMy companion, who had steered me through\
  \ the crowds to this corner of the room purposely to introduce me to the chairlift\
  \ dingbat, put her finger to her lips.\n\u201CHush,\u201D she said, \u201CJust wait\
  \ and see.\u201D\nWe waited for a break in the conversation and, when it came, my\
  \ companion, with her effortless social skills, did as she had promised, drew the\
  \ chairlift dingbat away from the mantelpiece, and introduced us. We talked for\
  \ over an hour that evening, and parted, very late, having arranged to meet for\
  \ het ontbijt in a spectacular Flemish cafe in the foothills of an important Alp\
  \ the next morning. He failed to appear. When I returned to my hotel, all waffled\
  \ up, I bumped into my companion in the lobby.\n\u201CNo show,\u201D I complained,\
  \ \u201CAnd I still don't believe he is a chairlift dingbat. We talked for an hour\
  \ at the cocktail party last night, and he was nothing if not sophisticated and\
  \ amusing and insouciant. He betrayed no sign of being what you persist in claiming\
  \ he is.\u201D\n\u201CDid you ask him outright?\u201D asked my companion.\n\u201C\
  Of course not!\u201D I protested, \u201CIt would be an unforgiveable social gaffe\
  \ to ask such a question at a sophisticated cocktail party.\u201D\n\u201CThat is\
  \ true,\u201D she conceded, \u201CAnd come to think of it, he is unlikely to have\
  \ given an honest answer. Chairlift dingbats are careful to protect their anonymity\
  \ when not actually lolling in the corner of a chairlift.\u201D\n\u201CMeaning\u2026\
  ?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CMeaning that they carefully cultivate the demeanour of a\
  \ chairlift dingbat but are adept at sloughing it off the moment they step out of\
  \ the chairlift on to terra firma,\u201D she said.\nI had no idea what she was talking\
  \ about, and I was too stodged with waffles to care.\n\u201CI am going to lie down\
  \ in the dark,\u201D I said.\nAs I lay in the dark, I thought about all I knew\u2014\
  or thought I knew\u2014of chairlift dingbats. That they lurked, unseen, in the corners\
  \ of chairlifts, waiting to accost the unsuspecting chairlift passenger on his ride\
  \ to or from the top of an Alpine peak. That they had the appearance of singularly\
  \ unappealing Swiss yokels and gave off an overpowering whiff of goat. That the\
  \ babbling to which they subjected their victim was largely unintelligible. That\
  \ within the confines of the chairlift, creaking on its cables, suspended over the\
  \ treacherous snow-covered mountain slopes, to be trapped with a chairlift dingbat\
  \ was a fate too horrible to imagine. That so repugnant was the mere presence of\
  \ the chairlift dingbat that many a victim felt compelled to throw open the door\
  \ of the chairlift and hurl themselves to certain death on the treacherous snow-covered\
  \ mountain slopes below. That when the Alpine politti came to investigate the suicide,\
  \ there was never a trace to be found of the chairlift dingbat, save for vestigial\
  \ traces of goaty whiff, soon dispersed in the sparkling Alpine chill.\nI sat up\
  \ in the dark of my hotel room and poured myself a stiffener from the bottle of\
  \ vapido ague on the bedside table. It was simply incomprehensible that the sophisticated\
  \ chap who had amused me with anecdotes at a sophisticated cocktail party the night\
  \ before could possibly be a chairlift dingbat. Dammit, surely such maddening creatures\
  \ did not even exist, were but the invention of Alpine mythmakers and storytellers.\
  \ Obviously the cocktail party guest and my companion were in cahoots, playing a\
  \ trick on me, even now were probably sat together in the spectacular Flemish cafe\
  \ laughing their heads off at my expense. I took another swig, put on my Christopher\
  \ Plummer-style Tyrolean jacket, and headed out into the streets of the skiing resort.\
  \ The air was cold and clear and crisp.\nI had sat in the spectacular Flemish cafe\
  \ a couple of hours ago. Now it was boarded up, and there was a sign in the window.\
  \ \u201CWe have moved\u201D, it said, in several different languages, in many of\
  \ which I was fluent. I rummaged in my Tyrolean jacket pocket for my gazetteer,\
  \ to ascertain the location of the new address. The cafe had moved to the summit\
  \ of the important Alp at the foot of which lay the resort. It was now accessible\
  \ only by chairlift.\nI made my way to the chairlift station, and towards the worst\
  \ horror of all.\n[2012-03-06]"
