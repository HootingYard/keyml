text: "One of Dobson's more preposterous follies was his attempt to rewrite Charles\
  \ Montagu Doughty's mad, massive classic Travels In Arabia Deserta (1888).\n\u201C\
  What do you mean, \u2018rewrite\u2019 it?\u201D asked Marigold Chew, when the out\
  \ of print pamphleteer announced his plan to his inamorata over breakfast one rainswept\
  \ March morning.\n\u201CI mean,\u201D spluttered Dobson, choking on a mouthful of\
  \ goosefat toastie, \u201CThat I will enter Doughty's head, as it were, see what\
  \ he saw, hear what he heard, smell the very same fumes his nostrils smelled, and\
  \ from those sensual prods I shall weave a spell of words to create a new and improved\
  \ Travels In Arabia Deserta, no less mad, no less massive, but better, grander,\
  \ more true.\u201D\n*It is an intriguing, if foolish, idea,\u201D said Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CBut I wonder if you have thought it through. You will know, from Doughty's\
  \ book, if not from other sources, that the desert is a vast and pitiless place\
  \ of burning heat upon which the sun beats down relentlessly. You, meanwhile, are\
  \ a man whose hatred of bright sunlight\u2014and hatred is not too strong a word\u2014\
  has often led me to think you have the constitution of a vampire. You are a man\
  \ who thrives under overcast skies and in drizzle, Dobson, not a sun-worshipper.\u201D\
  \n\u201CTwo points,\u201D replied Dobson, swallowing a forkful of shredded radish,\
  \ \u201CFirst, I have not actually read Doughty's book. Oh, I have skimmed it here\
  \ and there, gained a feel for its strange and highly-wrought prose, weighed its\
  \ mad mass in my hands, but I could not claim to be familiar with every last nook\
  \ and cranny of the text. Second, I do not intend actually to travel in the burning\
  \ sands of the hellish sun-bashed desert. If you listened carefully, you will have\
  \ heard me say that my plan is to enter into Doughty's head, from the comfort of\
  \ my escritoire, and to summon forth the new Dobsonized Travels In Arabia Deserta\
  \ through the majestic powers of imagination alone!\u201D\n\u201CAnd you will enter\
  \ his head how?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\n\u201CI snipped from a periodical a\
  \ photograph of the Doughty head,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CAnd I have affixed it\
  \ to the wall by my escritoire with a drawing pin. As soon as I am done with breakfast,\
  \ I shall sit and gaze at the picture, in awed concentration, and as I gaze, slowly\
  \ but surely the lineaments and integuments of the Doughty brain will become fused\
  \ with my own brain, and swimming before my eyes shall come wondrous mirages. Mirages,\
  \ after all, are the stuff of travels in Arabia Deserta, are they not? And then\
  \ I will take up my propelling pencil and scribble down, in impassioned prose, all\
  \ I see, all I hear, all I smell, while thus entranced. My plan is sound,\u201D\
  \ he concluded, \u201CAnd I shall give birth to a masterpiece!\u201D\nMarigold Chew\
  \ drained her beaker of milk slops and turned her head to look out of the window\
  \ at the downpour.\n\n\nIt was still raining later in the afternoon when Dobson\
  \ returned from a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal. He came crashing\
  \ through the door, sopping wet, leaving a trail of puddles in his wake. Marigold\
  \ Chew eyed him carefully.\n\u201CWho is this come a-crashing through the door?\u201D\
  \ she asked, \u201CIs it Dobson or Doughty, or some zany minglement of both Dobson\
  \ and Doughty?\u201D\nBy way of reply, the pamphleteer merely grunted.\n\u201CYou\
  \ are sopping wet and leaving a trail of puddles in your wake,\u201D said Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CNobody could look less like they had been travelling in Arabia Deserta.\
  \ I'll put the kettle on.\u201D\nAs she went to the kitchen sink, Marigold Chew\
  \ saw, in the waste bin, the snipped-out photograph of Charles Montagu Doughty's\
  \ head, torn in half and scrunched up, the hole pierced by Dobson's drawing pin\
  \ visible in the centre of the Doughty forehead.\n\n\u201CHow are you getting on\
  \ with your visionary rewriting?\u201D asked Marigold Chew that evening, as she\
  \ and Dobson sprawled on the sofa. From the Dansette on the sideboard came the finger-tapping\
  \ hoo-cha of Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra.\n\u201CI may have to rethink my plan,\u201D\
  \ said Dobson.\n\u201COh?\u201D\n\u201CI gazed and gazed at Doughty's head for hours,\u201D\
  \ said the pamphleteer, \u201CBut only one mirage, or vision, came swimming into\
  \ my head. I could neither replace it nor dislodge it. There is not enough material\
  \ there for a mad and massive book in two volumes, which was what I hoped to be\
  \ able to wreak from the wild imaginings boiling in my doubled Dobson-Doughty brain.\
  \ Instead, I shall have to make do with a recipe book. Or rather, a recipe pamphlet,\
  \ for I have but the one recipe. That was my mirage.\u201D\n\u201CWell, people are\
  \ always on the lookout for an exotic recipe, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew,\
  \ \u201CGet it scribbled down and I shall have it typeset in the morning on the\
  \ Gestetner machine in the shed.\u201D\n\nWhole Stuffed Camel\nIngredients\n  1\
  \ whole camel, medium size\n  1 whole lamb, large size\n  20 whole chickens, medium\
  \ size\n  60 eggs\n  12 kg rice\n  2 kg pine nuts\n  2 kg almonds\n  1 kg pistachio\
  \ nuts\n  110 gallons water\n  5 lbs black pepper\n  salt\nMethod\n  1. Skin, trim\
  \ and clean camel, lamb and chicken.\n  2. Boil until tender.\n  3. Cook rice until\
  \ fluffy.\n  4. Fry nuts until brown and mix with rice.\n  5. Hard boil eggs and\
  \ peel.\n  6. Stuff cooked chickens with hard boiled eggs and rice.\n  7. Stuff\
  \ cooked lamb with stuffed chickens.\n  8. Add more rice.\n  9. Stuff the camel\
  \ with the stuffed lamb and add rest of rice.\n  10. Broil over large charcoal pit\
  \ until brown.\n  11. Spread any remaining rice on large tray and place camel on\
  \ top of rice.\n  12. Decorate with boiled eggs and nuts.\n  13. Serves eighty to\
  \ a hundred famished travellers in Arabia Deserta.\n[My thanks to James Beckett\
  \ for drawing to my attention this splendid\u2014and genuine\u2014recipe.]\n[2013-03-25]"
