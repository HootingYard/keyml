text: "The devil came from Kansas. So we were informed by Procol Harum in one of their\
  \ songs (Brooker, Reid 1969), but I do not think that can be right. I have had several\
  \ lengthy discussions with the devil, late at night, at a Johnsonian crossroads\
  \ on a blasted heath, and his accent is not that of a Kansas native. Now it may\
  \ be, of course, that the devil is trying to pull a fast one on me, and that his\
  \ wiles include disguising his voice. But my ears are uncannily acute. I studied\
  \ at the Von Straubenzee Institute Of Fantastic Ears, high in the Alps, and spent\
  \ many an hour perched on the balcony, listening, listening. So if the devil was\
  \ mimicking an accent not his own, I think I would hear the imposture. No, I think\
  \ it is safe to say he does not come from Kansas.\nBut where, then, is the devil\
  \ from? My candidate would be somewhere in the vicinity of Prunedale. Prunedale,\
  \ for those of you who don't know, is a godforsaken little sprawl in California,\
  \ more a transit intersection than anything else, though it does boast two shopping\
  \ malls\u2014the Prunedale, the Prunetree\u2014a Senior Citizens\u2019 Centre, and\
  \ a post office. Historically, it is the site of a failed nineteenth century plum\
  \ orchard. Who knows but that the plum trees failed due to the malign influence\
  \ of the devil himself?, this being his home town, as I have ascertained after many,\
  \ many minutes of painstaking research. It is not merely his accent that gives the\
  \ game away. The devil, we know, has all the best prunes.\n\nNOTA BENE\_: I may\
  \ have to revise this piece. The Church of England has recently announced that climate\
  \ change is \u201CThe Great Demon\u201D. This is startling talk from the usually\
  \ woolly-brained Anglican hierarchy, and I hope it heralds a return to proper Victorian\
  \ hellfire-and-brimstone anathemas from the pulpit.\n[2014-02-13]"
