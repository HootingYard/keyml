text: "Recalling the incident of Mrs Flack and her terrifying hound the other day,\
  \ I mentioned that I was kept occupied and entertained not by children's television\
  \ but by a comic. That set me thinking about the comics I read as a tot. At one\
  \ time or another I was a devotee of The Beano, The Dandy, Wham!, The Topper, and\
  \ Whizzer And Chips. I remember certain characters\u2014Tupper of the Track, Billy\
  \ Whizz, General Jumbo, and Grimly Fiendish, who bore a startling resemblance to\
  \ the contemporary television person Dara O'Briain. They were all regulars, with\
  \ their own strips, but for some reason burnt into my brain is another character\
  \ who as I recall only ever appeared in a single story. This was an evil German\
  \ secret agent called Weems, and I remember him simply because his name was Weems.\
  \ It was the word, the sound, that caught my attention. And I have another fragmentary\
  \ memory, of an episode in a story, which held me spellbound, but in this case I\
  \ am not sure why.\nThe story itself I have forgotten. It was a western, and I was\
  \ not a great fan of westerns. Sure enough, my brother and I played Cowboys and\
  \ Indians in the Newty Field, but when immersed in my comics I had more compelling\
  \ claims on my attention\u2014evil German secret agents, for example. But there\
  \ was this one episode in the story which I have never forgotten. A cowboy had somehow\
  \ managed to get himself lost and abandoned in the desert. He was at the end of\
  \ his tether and had collapsed in the dust. Above him, vultures wheeled in the sky.\
  \ The text made plain to my infant mind that, when eventually the stricken cowboy\
  \ perished of hunger and thirst and exposure, the vultures would swoop down upon\
  \ his corpse and gobble him up. At least, that is what the text intended to make\
  \ plain. But I somehow misunderstood it. I thought the vultures would swoop if he\
  \ closed his eyes. Not if he fell asleep, and thus looked as if he were dead. No,\
  \ the vultures were circling, waiting for him to shut his eyes for an instant, at\
  \ which point they would swoop, and tear him to pieces with their savage beaks and\
  \ talons.\n\nNot surprisingly, my reading of the situation seemed the most terrifying\
  \ predicament one could fall into. I practised lying in bed keeping my eyes open\
  \ for as long as possible, desperately trying not to blink, to prepare myself for\
  \ the inevitable time when I would be uprooted from a suburban council estate and\
  \ tossed, alone and abandoned, into the desert. I kept an eye out for any vultures\
  \ which might appear, looming with malignant menace, in the Essex sky. As a good\
  \ Roman Catholic, I added a plea to be kept safe from vultures to my bedtime prayers.\n\
  What strikes me, recalling this in the cold light of adulthood, is the astonishing\
  \ lack of basic common sense. No wonder my mother used to warn me, in her thick\
  \ Flemish accent, that \u201Cone of dese days you will go out widout your head\u201D\
  . That head now contained the unshakeable conviction that vultures filled the sky\
  \ and were simply waiting for a person below to shut their eyes. You did not need\
  \ to be sprawled exhausted in the desert dust. You might be scampering along on\
  \ your way to the Newty Field, for example, and blink, and if a vulture were in\
  \ the vicinity, it would swoop down upon you and rip you to shreds. I lived in a\
  \ state of terror.\nHere is what I do not remember:\nWhat became of the cowboy in\
  \ the comic strip? Did he somehow survive, or was he pecked to pieces? It may be\
  \ that I was so unhinged by the thought of malevolent circling vultures that I stopped\
  \ reading, and there and then began practising keeping my eyes open.\nWhen did it\
  \ occur to me that I had never seen a vulture in the Essex sky? Or could I be sure\
  \ I had not? I was, after all, myopic from an early age\u2014possibly because I\
  \ strained my eyes by attempting not to blink for protracted periods. All those\
  \ birds up in the sky looked like vaguely similar blurs to me. I did know that a\
  \ vulture was bigger than, say, a sparrow, but that was about as far as my ornithological\
  \ knowledge went.\nHow long did I live in fear of vultures? There must have come\
  \ a point where I felt my prayers had been answered, that I had been kept safe,\
  \ and, most cogently, not only had I not been attacked by vultures but I had never\
  \ seen or heard of such an attack happening to anybody else. The day must have come,\
  \ I presume, when I was able to go about my tiny business outdoors without giving\
  \ vultures a thought. If only I had kept a diary at the time, I could pin down the\
  \ date, for it was surely one of the signal moments of my childhood, that day when\
  \ I peered up at the sky, a blue or grey blur, and consciously closed my eyes, without\
  \ a care in the world.\n[2012-07-11]"
