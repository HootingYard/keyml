text: "Long, long ago, in what seems like another life, I used to be paid a pittance\
  \ to write capsule film reviews. Since then, I have always had great respect for\
  \ those who have mastered what is a bewilderingly difficult form, summarising a\
  \ film (or a book, or a play, or whatever) in one or two sentences. I was prompted\
  \ to recall my own faltering steps in the art by the television listings in today's\
  \ Guardian. There are four films on the terrestrial channels tonight, with only\
  \ BBC2 eschewing cinema, in favour of snooker. And what an inspired choice the viewer\
  \ has! Here are condensed versions of the (uncredited) capsule reviews:\nBBC1, 11.20\_\
  : The Ghost And The Darkness\_: tedious adventure.\nITV1, 11.05\_: Showtime\_: leaden\
  \ action comedy.\nChannel Four, 10.00\_: Happy Gilmore\_: feeble sports comedy.\n\
  Five, 10.00\_: The Glimmer Man\_: dull and clich\xE9-ridden action thriller.\n[2007-12-10]"
