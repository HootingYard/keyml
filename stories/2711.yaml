text: 'We have seen how a comment comparing one of his symphonies to a pimple made
  Binder fume. In truth, the composer was much given to fuming. He fumed in circumstances
  where others, of a less choleric disposition, might simply tut or mumble or shrug.
  Nobody ever actually saw steam coming out of Binder''s ears, but he was invariably
  portrayed thus by cartoonists and by the more scurrilous painters of his day. Binder
  was a favourite subject of portraitists of all stripes, because he had such an extraordinary
  head. Words cannot quite capture its phantasmal oddity. And yet he was deemed the
  most handsome of composers by his admirers of both sexes, who were legion. Queues
  used to form at his dressing-room door whenever he deigned to appear at a concert
  hall, conducting one of his own works and a squib by an inferior for contrast. Even
  when fawned over, Binder fumed. He could occasionally be placated by marzipan treats,
  but not very often.
