text: "There is a glade in the woods where, once, gravediggers gathered of an evening\
  \ when their day's digging was done, and so it is known as Gravediggers\u2019 Glade.\
  \ They came directly from their graveyards, and brought their spades with them,\
  \ leaning the spades against the larches and laburnums and sycamores that dotted\
  \ the glade. Some came from graveyards far away, too far to trudge on foot, and\
  \ those gravediggers came on their donkeys, with their spades tied to panniers.\
  \ There can be something Christlike about a gravedigger riding a donkey along a\
  \ country lane, particularly if he has a beard and a soulful look in his eyes and\
  \ is dressed in a white shift. But no competent gravedigger wears white, for gravedigging\
  \ is filthy work, particularly during rainfall, it is work that throws up clods\
  \ of earth and muck with which the gravedigger's clothing is splattered, and so\
  \ he will wear black or brown or beige, and rather than a shift he will wear overalls\
  \ or dungarees, of tough cloth, if he knows what he is about. Even a gravedigger\
  \ so clad, if he has a beard and a soulful look and is wending his way astride a\
  \ donkey towards the glade as the sun sets can resemble Christ, however, if not\
  \ quite so perfectly.\nWhat must a spectator make, then, of a continual stream of\
  \ Christs, one after another, in the evening, on the lane, as they head for their\
  \ gathering in the glade? Some are on their donkeys and some are on foot, but even\
  \ the latter can look like Christ, during His Passion, carrying their spades as\
  \ Christ carried His cross. What a sight, indeed, and one you would have seen if,\
  \ all those years ago, you had been a peasant tilling his patch beside the lane,\
  \ or lolling in a haystack knocking back a flagon of cider, or engaged in some other\
  \ rustic evening pursuit. Thomas Hardy wrote about such things, but as far as I\
  \ know he never witnessed the parade of gravediggers on their way to Gravediggers\u2019\
  \ Glade in the woods. These are not Wessex woods.\nThere was little that was Christ-like\
  \ about their gatherings. They leaned their spades against the larches and laburnums\
  \ and sycamores, and those who had come far tied their donkeys to the same trees\
  \ with donkey-tying string, so the donkeys would not stray, although they let their\
  \ spades remain empanniered rather than removing them to lean against the trees\
  \ alongside the spades of their fellows. No, they no longer looked Christ-like as\
  \ they gathered, all in black and brown and beige and matted in muck, muck which\
  \ was splattered in their beards and their hair as well as upon their tough gravediggers\u2019\
  \ clothing.\nAnd, gathered together, they began to grunt. They grunted softly, and\
  \ loudly, and kept on grunting until they had coaxed the Grunty Man, that monster\
  \ from the bedtime stories of their childhoods, from his lair up in the hills. The\
  \ Grunty Man came bounding down to Gravediggers\u2019 Glade at inhuman speed, hairy\
  \ and slobbering and grunting, and as soon as he was among them, the gravediggers\
  \ fell silent. They stooped to pick pebbles from the ground, and they chucked the\
  \ pebbles at the Grunty Man, many, many pebbles, but not with great force, for they\
  \ wished to tease him rather than to harm him. And when they had exhausted the pebbles,\
  \ the gravediggers began to sing. They all had sheet music tucked into the pockets\
  \ of their black and brown and beige overalls or dungarees, and they lined up as\
  \ a choir would line up, and they belted out in their gruff gravedigger voices selections\
  \ from Charles Ives\u2019 self-published collection of 114 Songs (1922). They sang\
  \ At Sea and Charlie Rutlage and Like A Sick Eagle. They sang Luck And Work and\
  \ Grantchester and Ich Grolle Nicht. They sang Songs My Mother Taught Me and The\
  \ Housatonic At Stockbridge. They sang Marie and Rosamunde and Mists and Watchman\
  \ and Those Evening Bells. And they sang Tom Sails Away, as a sort of farewell to\
  \ the Grunty Man, for by now he had sailed, or scampered, away, for he was frightened\
  \ of singing, and the gravediggers\u2019 songs always made him flee back up to the\
  \ hills where he cowered in his lair until lured back to the glade by the grunting\
  \ of the gravediggers when next they gathered there of an evening.\nFear stalks\
  \ the countryside, especially fear of the Grunty Man, and that is how the gravediggers\
  \ held their fear at bay. They could have sung songs by other composers, of course,\
  \ by Schubert or Schumann or Peter Warlock or Peter Blegvad or Yoko Ono, but each\
  \ of them was fond of Ives and they had splurged their wages on the sheet music\
  \ for the 114 Songs, trooping into Dennis Pigstraw's sheet music shop in the village\
  \ of Cack posing as a choir. All singing terrified the Grunty Man. Teasingly pelted\
  \ with pebbles and sung at, he never learned that he should ignore the grunting\
  \ with which he was coaxed from his lair, for his brain was tiny and hot and pitiable,\
  \ and every single evening he fell for the same trick. Had it happened in Wessex,\
  \ Thomas Hardy would have written about it, I am sure. But there is much that happens\
  \ elsewhere in the countryside that no one speaks of or writes of, and that is as\
  \ much a pity as the weakness of the Grunty Man's tiny hot brain.\n[2008-11-01]"
