text: "There I was, crumpled and decisive, standing between two trees on the edge\
  \ of the Blister Lane Bypass. The trees were both yews, I think. I was looking for\
  \ curlews. The first one I saw was made of plastic, it was a toy or perhaps a decorative\
  \ figurine. It had been abandoned in the gutter. Then I saw a second curlew, swooping\
  \ across the blue, blue sky. I did not know it then, but within hours there would\
  \ be no blue to be seen, for dark and brooding thunderclouds would waft in from\
  \ the east. A third curlew appeared in my mind's eye. It was gigantic and ferocious\
  \ and terrifying. I shuddered. I walked away from the yews, in the direction of\
  \ Bodger's Spinney, pulling my resplendent teal cardigan tight about my torso. There\
  \ was a fourth curlew, an embroidered one, on my necktie. Why in the name of heaven\
  \ was I wearing a necktie? All of a sudden this length of fabric wrapped around\
  \ my neck felt like a hangman's noose. I took it off, with violent jerks, and discarded\
  \ it in a puddle, where it would remain until discovered later that day by a scavenging\
  \ hobbledehoy from The Bashings, that gloomy cluster of huts which sane people shirk.\
  \ Oh, as the tie dropped into the puddle I saw a fugitive reflection in the water\
  \ of the embroidered curlew, so that made five. It was still only ten in the morning.\n\
  By five past ten I had seen another dozen curlews, or it may have been a single\
  \ curlew seen twelve times, I cannot be altogether certain. I was standing on Sawdust\
  \ Bridge at the time, feeling hopeless and disgruntled and cantankerous. The tunic\
  \ I was wearing beneath my cardigan, which I had stolen from an ingrate, was playing\
  \ havoc with my [invented skin disease], and rashes were appearing. My doctor had\
  \ prescribed a daily dose of some sort of bean mashed up into a bowl of milk of\
  \ magnesia, and I had forgotten to take my dose that morning, so keen was I to see\
  \ curlews.\nLater I took a mop and began to clean the floor of one of the corridors\
  \ in an ugly building which shall remain nameless. I was indoors now, so unlikely\
  \ to see any curlews. But lo!, little Maisie\u2014a polka-dot-dressed orphan whose\
  \ parents perished in the Tet Offensive\u2014came rushing up to me clutching her\
  \ stamp album and showed me her latest acquisitions, a set of twenty bird-related\
  \ thematics issued by the Tantarabim Interim Authority. I could not help but note,\
  \ as I shared my Brazil nuts with starving Maisie, that eight of the stamps depicted\
  \ curlews.\nOn my way home, as the evening closed in and dark thoughts of skulduggery\
  \ frolicked in my throbbing skull, I saw a dead curlew on the canal towpath. Bird\
  \ detectives had already thrown a cordon around it, so I was unable to take a closer\
  \ look.\nThat night, by candlelight, I took out my ledger and gave names to each\
  \ of the twenty-six curlews I had seen. Alcibiades, Bim, Chumpot, Dromedary, Eidolon,\
  \ Flaps, Gash, Heliogabalus, Inthod\u2026. That is how I started my list. Then I\
  \ recalled that I had set out to see forty-four curlews. I gnashed my teeth in misery\
  \ and dejection. And I recalled that I had forgotten to wring out the mop.\nYou\
  \ will recognise the above as an extract from Dobson's pamphletto A Description\
  \ Of And Reverie Upon Forty-Four Curlews (out of print). Note that I use the word\
  \ \u201Cpamphletto\u201D to distinguish this work from the general run of pamphlets\
  \ spewed out by Dobson. Note, too, that at this time, and in this place, I am not\
  \ going to explain the difference between the pamphlets and the pamphlettos. Let\
  \ it gnaw away at your mental innards, if you will.\nOur purpose today is to subject\
  \ the text to analysis. I have been asked innumerable times\u2014well, numerable,\
  \ in that I can count the times I have been asked, on the fingers of one maimed\
  \ hand\u2014whether Dobson is telling the truth, or making the whole thing up. No\
  \ matter how rigorous our analysis, irrespective of the analytical techniques employed,\
  \ I am afraid to say this is an unanswerable question. One would need to delve deep\
  \ into the biography of the pamphleteer, deeper than anyone with working wits in\
  \ their head has ever seen fit to delve, to pronounce the passage true or false.\
  \ It may even be a combination of the two, partly fact and partly fiction. Or Dobson\
  \ may have sincerely believed it to be true, when it was actually an hallucination,\
  \ or a series of hallucinations, brought on by exhaustion or the jangles or entrancement\
  \ by a tiny sinister gnome-like fellow dressed all in green. It is unlikely we will\
  \ ever know.\nThis is not to say that we cannot analyse the passage, using certain\
  \ techniques developed by Bl\xF6tzmann, to ascertain the more important question\
  \ of whether Dobson would have known a curlew when he saw one. After all, he was\
  \ a man of boundless ornithological ignorance, as is attested not only by his inamorata\
  \ Marigold Chew and by several of his acquaintances, not all of them shady characters,\
  \ but by the pamphleteer himself, in his own words, notably in the pamphlet My Boundless\
  \ Ornithological Ignorance, Together With A Paean Of Praise To Googie Withers (out\
  \ of print). And careful study of the present text reveals that, in spite of the\
  \ promise in the title to describe forty-four curlews, Dobson barely has a word\
  \ to say about their appearance. Let us tabulate, in an objective tabulating manner,\
  \ what he does say.\nCurlew Number One\_: plastic\nCurlew Number Two\_: swooping\n\
  Curlew Number Three\_: gigantic, ferocious and terrifying, but also imaginary\n\
  Curlew Number Four\_: embroidered\nCurlew Number Five\_: Curlew Number Four reflected\
  \ in a puddle\nIt is with reluctance that I am going to abandon my exciting tabulation,\
  \ or tabulature, so soon, but quite frankly Dobson has nothing whatsoever to say\
  \ about the other twenty-one curlews he claims to have seen that day, at least nothing\
  \ that persuades us they were actually curlews as opposed to, say, godwits or pratincoles\
  \ or starlings. At no point does he describe what he is looking at in the kind of\
  \ detail we would like if we were to be convinced that he knew what he was talking\
  \ about.\nThis is the level of piercing insight one is able to gain by applying\
  \ Bl\xF6tzmannist analysis techniques to a piece of text, although of course it\
  \ is only piercing when the text under scrutiny mentions birds. Absent birds, and\
  \ you are left rudderless, disorientated and whirling ever more rapidly into a maelstrom\
  \ of mental chaos. Or so I am told. By Bl\xF6tzmann himself. Shouting his head off.\
  \ On the blower.\nNOTE\_: Many thanks to Vincent Byrne for \u201Cpamphletto\u201D\
