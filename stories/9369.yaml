text: "Captain's Log, stardate the Ides of March, Year Dot plus [redacted]. Symmes\
  \ was right after all! John Cleves Symmes, Jr. (1779\u20131829), who posited that\
  \ there were holes at the poles through which one could gain access to the hollow\
  \ earth! He was absolutely correct in every particular except one. He had the wrong\
  \ planet! It is not our gorgeous Earth that is hollow, but Neptune! Less gorgeous,\
  \ certainly, and much, much colder even than our Arctic and Antarctic regions, and\
  \ lacking penguins, in fact generally unearthly as planets go. But it has holes\
  \ at its poles, as we have seen during our sweeping orbit of the planet as part\
  \ of our latest five-year mission. Tomorrow we shall make an emergency landing close\
  \ to one of the holes at one of the poles and send a team down on rope ladders.\n\
  Captain's Log, next day. A stupid and maddening argument erupted regarding which\
  \ of the holes at which of Neptune's poles the landing party should descend on rope\
  \ ladders. Mister Poxhaven is terrified of penguins, and argued for the Neptunian\
  \ North Pole. We simply could not drum into his pointy head that there are no penguins\
  \ on Neptune, in either the south or north polar regions. He stuffed his ears with\
  \ space-putty so he could not hear us beseeching him. Second Officer Wilmot made\
  \ equally vociferous claims for making a descent at the Neptunian South Pole. He\
  \ is fond of penguins, and thinks there may be a colony living just below the surface,\
  \ in one of the interior spheres of the Hollow Neptune. I lost my temper with both\
  \ of them and had them slammed in the brig. I decided to postpone the landing until\
  \ tomorrow, and sought to keep the rest of the crew occupied with games of ping\
  \ pong and communal reading of interesting articles from back numbers of the Reader's\
  \ Digest.\nCaptain's Log, the following day. Fool that I am, I entrusted the key\
  \ to the brig to Purser Blot, who has mislaid it. Regulations forbid carrying a\
  \ jemmy aboard the starship, so we cannot force the door. Mister Poxhaven and Second\
  \ Officer Wilmot are growing increasingly fractious. They rub each other up the\
  \ wrong way in the best of circumstances, and these are by no means the best of\
  \ circumstances. We continue to orbit Neptune. Bosun Cugat, the ship's vampire,\
  \ has reported some intriguing meteorological and magnetic phenomena. Peas for supper,\n\
  Captain's Log, Ides of March plus three. Mister Poxhaven and Second Officer Wilmot\
  \ escaped from the brig by means of top secret technology the details of which are\
  \ redacted. With inhuman patience I repeated, until I was blue in the face, that\
  \ there is no such creature as a Neptunian penguin. We drew straws to decide whether\
  \ to descend the hole at the North or the South Pole. I used the last of our drinking\
  \ straws. As soon as we leave Neptune's orbit we shall have to locate and dock at\
  \ a supply planetoid to replenish the drinking straws and several grocery items.\
  \ I should not have to fret about such matters when there is a hole at a pole to\
  \ descend on rope ladders.\nCaptain's Log, Ides of March again. Mister Poxhaven,\
  \ Second Officer Wilmot, Doctor Von Straubenzee, and I are on a platform within\
  \ the interior of the Hollow Neptune. Our first discovery, after we descended on\
  \ rope ladders, is that there is no such concept as time down here. According to\
  \ the bizarre scratchings on the wall, it is, always has been, and always will be\
  \ the Ides of March. There is no sign of any penguins\u2014Mister Poxhaven is relieved,\
  \ Second Officer Wilmot tearful. Our breathing apparatus is holding up as well as\
  \ can be expected. Less so our coathangers, which prove wholly useless in the Neptunian\
  \ interior. I have asked Doctor Von Straubenzee to analyse the problem using his\
  \ powerful artificial brain.\nCaptain's Log, still the Ides of March. We have moved\
  \ from the platform into a subterranean arena which appears to be some kind of Neptunian\
  \ warehouse. The scratchings on the wall here are if anything even more bizarre.\
  \ Second Officer Wilmot claims to have seen several leafcutter ants, more or less\
  \ the size of earthly leafcutter ants, but none of them were carrying leaves. Or\
  \ so he says. We suspect he is hallucinating. I have taken the precaution of placing\
  \ the [redacted] contraption on his head, just to be on the safe side.\nCaptain's\
  \ Log, the Ides of March. Yesterday, whatever that means down here in the Neptunian\
  \ interior, Mister Poxhaven discovered the nozzles, thousands upon thousands of\
  \ them. Every so often they spurt forth some kind of nougat with the consistency\
  \ of jelly. It is pink and white, ish, thus not unlike earthly nougat. Doctor Von\
  \ Straubenzee volunteered to ingest some. Before any of us could stop him, he punctured\
  \ his breathing apparatus with the points of a pair of pinking shears and sucked\
  \ up nougat straight from a nozzle. When he did not immediately keel over and lie\
  \ splayed on the floor twitching with convulsive fits, Mister Poxhaven and Second\
  \ Officer Wilmot followed suit. On my next voyage I must recruit less impetuous\
  \ crew members. Shortly thereafter the three of them keeled over and lay splayed\
  \ on the floor twitching with convulsive fits. I put two and two together in my\
  \ pulsating captainy brain and blamed the nougat from the nozzles.\nCaptain's Log,\
  \ the Ides of March. There is no let up in the twitching and convulsive fits. While\
  \ I wait for my men either to recover or die, I try to concentrate on straightening\
  \ out at least one of the coathangers, at least for five minutes. Communications\
  \ with the ship have deteriorated to meaningless static. Out of the corner of my\
  \ eye, a little while ago, in the shadows, I think I saw a penguin, or a leafcutter\
  \ ant. How I wish I had thought to bring a back number of the Reader's Digest with\
  \ me. For God's sake look after our people.\n\nSymmes\u2019 tombstone. All rights\
