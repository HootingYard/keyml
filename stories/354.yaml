text: "OutaSpaceman dropped me a line to point out that I failed to observe the feast\
  \ day of St Mungo last Monday, 14th January. Remiss of me, I know. To make up for\
  \ such an inexplicable oversight, let me draw your attention to St Prisca, whose\
  \ feast day is today.\n\n\_\nSt Prisca was a child martyr, and you can read all\
  \ about her in The Book Of Saints And Friendly Beasts by Abbie Farwell Brown. You\
  \ will learn how, \u201CSmall and defenceless though she was, she did not fear to\
  \ tell everyone what she believed and Whose Cross she followed. So she soon became\
  \ known as a firm little Christian maiden.\u201D When you have read this stirring\
  \ tale, and wept, yet felt strangely uplifted, I recommend some of the other stories\
  \ you will find there, such as Saint Keneth [sic] Of The Gulls, Saint Launomar's\
  \ Cow, Saint Fronto's Camels, and Saint Werburgh And Her Goose. That should be quite\
  \ enough saints to keep you occupied and out of mischief.\nNOTE\_: It strikes me\
  \ that St Prisca comes across as a Christian version of heroic infant Tiny Enid,\
  \ many of whose exploits have been recorded here. I am not aware to what, if any,\
  \ religious persuasion Tiny Enid adhered, but I shall do some research and let readers\
  \ know in due course.\n[2008-01-18]"
