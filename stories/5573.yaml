text: "\u201CThe habit is now confirmed in me of spending the greater part of the\
  \ day in sleep, while by night I wander far and wide through the city under the\
  \ sedative influence of a tincture which has become necessary to my life. Such an\
  \ existence of shadow is not without charm; nor, I think, could many minds be steadily\
  \ subjected to its conditions without elevation, deepened awe. To travel alone with\
  \ the Primordial cannot but be solemn. The moon is of the hue of the glow-worm;\
  \ and Night of the sepulchre. Nux bore not less Thanatos than Hupnos, and the bitter\
  \ tears of Isis redundulate to a flood. At three, if a cab rolls by, the sound has\
  \ the augustness of thunder. Once, at two, near a corner, I came upon a priest,\
  \ seated, dead, leering, his legs bent. One arm, supported on a knee, pointed with\
  \ rigid accusing forefinger obliquely upward. By exact observation, I found that\
  \ he indicated Betelgeux, the star \u201Ca\u201D which shoulders the wet sword of\
  \ Orion. He was hideously swollen, having perished of dropsy. Thus in all Supremes\
  \ is a grotesquerie; and one of the sons of Night is\u2014Buffo.\u201D\nM P Shiel,\
