text: "Scene One. The Monkey House at Central Park Zoo, New York, on\_ the 16th November\
  \ 1906. A FOREIGN GENT and a RESPECTABLE LADY are standing by the cage of KNOCKO\
  \ THE MONKEY.\nFOREIGN GENT\_: Good morning, madam.\nRESPECTABLE LADY (Turning to\
  \ look at him)\_: Why sir, you are like unto a sun god! Your light obliterates your\
  \ surroundings! But do you always keep your hands in your overcoat pockets when\
  \ addressing a respectable lady?\nThe FOREIGN GENT moves towards the RESPECTABLE\
  \ LADY and \u201Cannoys\u201D her. Or possibly not.\nEnter the NEW YORK COP.\nNEW\
  \ YORK COP\_: (To the FOREIGN GENT)\_: I've had my eye on you, chum. You're under\
  \ arrest!\nKNOCKO THE MONKEY looks on, while monkeying about in his cage.\n\nScene\
  \ Two. The police cells, later that day. The FOREIGN GENT is weeping loudly.\nEnter\
  \ HEINRICH CONREID, Director of the New York Metropolitan Opera.\nFOREIGN GENT (Still\
  \ weeping)\_: Thank heaven you have come!\nHEINRICH CONREID\_: Don't you worry about\
  \ a thing. I have posted bail. Do you think for one minute I would allow Enrico\
  \ Caruso, the finest Italian tenor of them all, to languish in prison?\n\nScene\
  \ Three. The courtroom, a week later.\nPROSECUTING COUNSEL\_: Tell us what happened,\
  \ officer.\nNEW YORK COP\_: This foreign gent was \u201Cannoying\u201D several women\
  \ and girls in full view of Knocko The Monkey in the Monkey House. He has slits\
  \ in the pockets of his overcoat. Enrico Caruso, that is, not Knocko.\nPROSECUTING\
  \ COUNSEL\_: It is because of the crowd of moral perverts and dogs and curs out\
  \ there in the courtroom who come here to listen\u2026 Our mothers and our sisters\
  \ are not safe in the streets; they cannot go about without being subjected to insult\
  \ by this scum from the lazaretto of Naples.\nJUDGE\_: (To the FOREIGN GENT, who\
  \ is indeed famous tenor Enrico Caruso)\_: Guilty as charged. I fine you ten dollars.\n\
  \nScene Four. The Fire Station, later.\nALFRED M DOWNES (Thinking aloud)\_: This\
  \ monkey house incident and the subsequent legal palaver has stirred public interest\
  \ in Knocko The Monkey. He may have been one of the monkeys kept as mascots by the\
  \ Fire Department until their disruptive antics meant they had to be removed to\
  \ the zoo. I think I will take advantage of the brouhaha and write a book called\
  \ Firefighters And Their Pets. It should be ready for publication by next year.\n\
