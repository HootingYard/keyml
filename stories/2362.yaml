  \ at the court of Louis XIV, or possibly Louis XVI. I always get them mixed up,\
  \ unlike the earlier Frankish kings, with whose doings I am frighteningly familiar.\
  \ Whether XIV or XVI, Louis did indeed employ someone to devise anagrams for the\
  \ purpose of foretelling the future and bringing arcana to light. R., too, may have\
  \ foretold the future, in the sense that any or all of the above phrases may spark\
  \ some fizz in Mr Key's cranium, resulting in a piece of sensible prose. Watch this\
  \ space.\nThe last I heard, Huberman's sold off their dwindling supply of pneumatic\
  \ belligerometers to a passing pedlar, who careens along the lanes of some godforsaken\
  \ part of the country in an unregistered ice cream van. Hail it to a halt, and he\
  \ might sell one to you.\n[2009-04-26]"
