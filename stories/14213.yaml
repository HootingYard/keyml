text: "I was riding through the desert on a horse with no name. This was asking for\
  \ trouble, and sure enough, after passing plants and birds and rocks and things\
  \ and sand and hills and rings we arrived at a Horse Registration Station. A cowpoke\
  \ in a poncho bid us to stop, so I pulled on the reins and patted my horse on its\
  \ horsey head.\n\u201CBefore you go any further I must register your horse,\u201D\
  \ said the cowpoke.\n\u201CRegister away!\u201D I said, blithely I hoped. I had\
  \ practised blitheness of speech at drama school, but only now did I understand\
  \ the yawning gulf between strutting upon the stage and negotiating the real world\
  \ of deserts and Horse Registration Stations manned by enponchoed cowpokes.\n\u201C\
  First I will need the name of your horse,\u201D he said.\n\u201CAnd what will you\
  \ need second?\u201D I asked, playing for time.\n\u201CSecond I will need any aliases\
  \ or pseudonyms by which your horse is known.\u201D\nI wondered what would happen\
  \ if I cried \u201CYippee-ky-oh-ky-ay!\u201D and dug my spurs into the horse's horsey\
  \ flanks and galloped away, leaving the cowpoke in a trail of dust.\n\u201CDon't\
  \ get any funny ideas about galloping off on an unregistered horse,\u201D said the\
  \ cowpoke, adding \u201CYou won't get far\u201D with an air of menace. I am unusually\
  \ alert to threats of menace, by dint of hard experience, and I do not mean merely\
  \ stage menace as met with in certain plays by certain dramatists. No. I mean real\
  \ menace in the real world of plants and birds and rocks and things and sand and\
  \ hills and rings.\nFor one wild moment I considered lying, plucking a name for\
  \ my nameless horse from within the dark ignorant recesses of my cranial integuments.\
  \ But the cowpoke again forestalled me. Was he a clairvoyant cowpoke?\n\u201CAnd\
  \ don't just make up a name,\u201D he warned, \u201CI will know if you are lying,\
  \ and by the martyred sinews of Saint Blodwyst, you will not want to suffer the\
  \ consequences of trying to pull the wool over my eyes.\u201D\nI did not doubt him.\
  \ He spoke with the kind of effortless authority of a character I had once played,\
  \ to no little acclaim, in a stage production of something or other by one of the\
  \ Norwegian playwrights.\nI had little option but to blurt out the truth.\n\u201C\
  My horse has no name,\u201D I blurted.\nThe cowpoke did not react immediately. Then\
  \ he fixed me with a gaze that would have chilled the blood were we not broiling\
  \ in the heat of the desert. He looked at me, and then he looked at the horse. He\
  \ rummaged in his poncho. He hummed a snatch of light opera, Il Ingrazziatiniatoni-apoppiapippi,\
  \ I think. Then he took from within his poncho a pebble, and with sudden and devastating\
  \ accuracy threw it up into the sky and clonked a bird, which plummeted to earth\
  \ stone dead at his feet.\n\u201CEach time a nameless horse tries to pass this Station,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CA bird must die. So it is written. Learn that lesson well, stranger.\
  \ Now turn around and do not return.\u201D\n\u201CWhere is it written?\u201D I asked.\n\
  But the cowpoke had taken from within his poncho a shovel, and was busy burying\
  \ the bird in the desert sand.\nI turned my horse about, dug in my spurs, and we\
  \ galloped away, back whence we had come, all the way across the desert, all the\
  \ way back to the eastern seaboard and the theatre on the pier at Point Punctilio,\
  \ where the tattered posters were still just about legible, the posters that advertised\
  \ our critically-panned performance of The Tragedy of Trubshaw, about a lone rider,\
  \ and his horse, a horse with no name.\n[2015-11-30]"
