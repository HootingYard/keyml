text: "I spent yesterday recovering from the rigours of the Evening Of Lopsided Prose\
  \ & Lugubrious Music at Woolfson & Tay held on Friday. Those of you who were unable\
  \ to attend or who could not be dragged there by wild horses will be pleased to\
  \ know that the whole kit and kaboodle was recorded by ResonanceFM (thanks to Chris\
  \ Weaver and Johnny Seven) for broadcast as a Hooting Yard Special at a date to\
  \ be announced, and thereafter as a pod thing. I shall alert you to these developments\
  \ when I know the details.\nI must also thank Shivaun Woolfson and Frances Tay,\
  \ whose splendid independent bookshop / cafe / gallery hosted the event and who\
  \ ensured the whole thing ran smoothly. I suggest all Hooting Yard devotees make\
  \ a beeline for the shop whenever they are in London. It occurs to me that every\
  \ now and then you may actually wish to read something other than my outpourings,\
  \ in which case you will find a fine selection of books there.\nThanks too of course\
  \ to Outa_Spaceman for joining me on singing and ukulele duty. I can neither sing\
  \ nor play the ukulele, so that part of the evening would have been an absolute\
  \ disaster without him. I am grateful too to Pansy Cradledew for her assistance\
  \ during the Poetry Masterclass.\nMy only disappointment is that the assembled throng\
  \ seemed not to understand I was delivering a series of serious lectures on topics\
  \ as diverse as birds, owl gods, Virginia Woolf's sausage and haddock dilemma, and\
  \ seaweed heroes, and my talks were greeted with immoderate laughter and the occasional\
  \ outbreak of hilarity. As I said in the programme notes, \u201Cunseemly pangs can\
  \ be tempered by moral balance\u201D. Do try to remember that next time, whenever\
  \ the next time is.\n\nMr Key & Ms Cradledew explain poesy to the masses\nSnap by\
