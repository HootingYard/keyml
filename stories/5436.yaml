text: 'Crooner Bong Crisby went widdershins round the kirk. Three times he did it,
  in fog, mist, and murk. He had not read his M R James, or so his weeping widow claims.
  He vanished off the earth and has no tomb. I hear his golden crooning in my living
  room. It issues from the walls, all day and all night, crooning, pleading for his
  widow''s mite.
