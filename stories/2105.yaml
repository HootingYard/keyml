text: "Weedy poet Dennis Beerpint recently received a commission from PIG to write\
  \ a ballade in celebration of the election of its new Presidento. PIG, for those\
  \ of you wallowing in ignorance, stands for the Porridge Information Groupuscule,\
  \ a body devoted to promoting the sale and consumption of porridge in every corner\
  \ of the land.\nSince he became a beatnik, Beerpint's Muse has deserted him, and\
  \ he has written nothing except for fragmentary squibs. He accepted the commission,\
  \ partly because of the generous fee and partly in the hope that his versifying\
  \ gifts might be reborn. Alas, he spent many hours sat staring hopelessly out of\
  \ the window with an empty brain.\nFinally, in desperation, he cast around in anthologies\
  \ for something which, if he could not quite pass off as his own, he could tinker\
  \ with, or use as a model. As luck would have it, he discovered George Huddesford's\
  \ 1802 poem The scum uppermost when the Middlesex porridge-pot boils over\_:\_ an\
  \ heroic election ballad with explanatory notes\_: accompanied with\_: An admonitory\
  \ nod to a blind horse. Here was a work that fitted the bill perfectly, featuring\
  \ not only porridge and elections, but horses and scum. As I write, Beerpint is\
  \ mucking about with the text to turn it into something he can call his own.\nHuddesford,\
  \ incidentally, had a way with titles, among his other published pieces being Bubble\
  \ And Squeak\_: A Gallimaufry of British Beef with the Chopped Cabbage of Gallic\
  \ Philosophy (1799). As for PIG, it is held by some of the members that the proper\
  \ title of Timothy Mo's 1991 novel The Redundancy Of Courage should in fact be The\
  \ Consistency Of Porridge, though this is thought to be a comment on its prose style.\n\
