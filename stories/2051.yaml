  \ of the comments on the Drabblecast* reading of Boiled Black Broth And Cornets.\
  \ One of the pleasures of having stories read there\u2014apart from the fact that\
  \ I was paid thirteen quid for this one\u2014is the nature of some of the contributions\
  \ to the discussion forum. The audience is, I suspect, at something of a tangent\
  \ to the Hooting Yard listenership.\nConsider this, from \u201Cdelfedd\u201D: \u201C\
  What the bleep happened in that story? I got the voodoo zombie part. But why did\
  \ she go absolutely insane?\u201D Perhaps I am reading it wrong, but \u201Cdelfedd\u201D\
  \ appears to be suggesting that to ply your friends with voodoo zombie soup is perfectly\
  \ normal behaviour. Only later does Becke Beiderbix go \u201Ccompletely insane\u201D\
  . I find this quite a worrying attitude, the more so because \u201Cdelfedd\u201D\
  's location is given as \u201CEverywhere\u201D, meaning that s/he could barge in\
  \ through my door at any moment, in full voodoo zombie mode.\n* NOTE\_: Incidentally,\
  \ I have been wondering what the connection is between Norm Sherman's podcast and\
  \ our own dear Margaret Drabble. And does he have plans to launch another podcast\
  \ named after her sister A S Byatt?\n[2009-03-13]"
