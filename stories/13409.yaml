text: "\nI was not surprised, when I set out to reacquaint myself with Robert Wyatt's\
  \ complete back catalogue, that memories came flooding back. The earlier part of\
  \ his career coincided with my adolescence, that time when some of our enduring\
  \ enthusiasms lodge themselves in our souls. Wyatt was my great musical hero when\
  \ I was fourteen, and he remains an abiding figure, even if I no longer worship\
  \ him, as I did then, as a god. But listening to the very first records, with Soft\
  \ Machine, prompted memories of another of my teenage talismans, and more particularly\
  \ of something irrevocably lost, and lost not just to me but to everyone.\nAt the\
  \ beginning of Soft Machine Volume Two, Wyatt announces that what we are about to\
  \ hear is \u201Ca choice selection of rivmic melodies from the official orchestra\
  \ of the College of \u2018Pataphysics\u201D. Like many another spotty youth with\
  \ intellectual yearnings, I pored over the lyrics of my favourite albums, and in\
  \ this case I wondered: was there really such a college?, were Soft Machine really\
  \ its official orchestra?, and, er, what the hell was \u2018pataphysics anyway?\
  \ That word rang a faint bell, and it was not long before I recalled where I had\
  \ heard it before. \u201CMaxwell's Silver Hammer\u201D from Abbey Road\u2014arguably\
  \ the most irritating song in the Beatles\u2019 canon\u2014opens with Joan studying\
  \ \u201C'pataphysical science in the home\u201D.\nBecause it was Wyatt, because\
  \ it was intriguing, because it was obscure, I wanted to find out more about this\
  \ \u2018pataphysics business. But where to start? And that, precisely, is what we\
  \ have lost, that question of where to start. If I were a teenager today, the question\
  \ would not even occur to me. I would head straight for the wikipedia. From the\
  \ comfort of my smelly sock-strewn bedroom, and pausing only for the occasional\
  \ pot noodle, within a few hours I could find out all I wished to know about \u2018\
  pataphysics, familiarise myself with the life of Alfred Jarry, download the texts\
  \ of his plays and prose, and veer off in other promising directions, towards Dada\
  \ and surrealism. By the time I tumbled into bed my head would be crammed with the\
  \ knowledge that, four decades ago, took me years to acquire.\nAnd this, I think,\
  \ is a great loss. Complete access to everything all the time seems\u2014and sometimes\
  \ is\u2014wondrous, even miraculous. But what is lost is the pleasure of pursuit,\
  \ following a trail, serendipitous discoveries, unexpected byways, and\u2014most\
  \ importantly\u2014the time taken. The instant availability of all that information\
  \ to me, aged fourteen, could never be as valuable as the process of its gradual\
  \ acquisition over months and years.\nWhere I did begin was with my parents\u2019\
  \ bookshelves. I have written before about the experience of growing up on a bleak\
  \ council estate, but of course I was never culturally impoverished. Quite apart\
  \ from the teeming bookshelves, I was a bus- and Tube-ride away from London. Also,\
  \ back then, my local library was still a building filled with books, and not the\
  \ \u201Cchat-\u2018n\u2019-snack zone\u201D (in the approving words of Labour's\
  \ last \u201Cculture\u201D secretary) it, and so many others, have become.\nUnfortunately,\
  \ eclectic though my parents\u2019 tastes were, they did not run to a love of screechy-voiced\
  \ madcap alcoholic visionary French writers of the fin de si\xE8cle. I was able\
  \ to dig out stray references in some of their many art books. Further mentions\
  \ popped up from time to time in the pages of the dear old NME in its halcyon days,\
  \ usually in interviews with some of my other favourites like Slapp Happy or Henry\
  \ Cow. In the library I found a copy of Ubu Roi. I somehow discovered the existence\
  \ of a book called The Banquet Years by Roger Shattuck, a quarter of which was devoted\
  \ to a biography of and critical essay on Jarry. I remember asking my father to\
  \ buy it for me the next time he popped into Foyle's (which was pretty much every\
  \ week.) On one of my own forays into town, at a time when Charing Cross Road was\
  \ packed with bookshops, I found a Jonathan Cape anthology of Jarry's Selected Writings.\
  \ And one day I was unreasonably overexcited to receive in the post, as a gift from\
  \ my sister in America, a copy of the Evergreen Review (Volume 4, Number 13, May-June\
  \ 1960), a 190-page paperback special issue entitled What Is \u2018Pataphysics?\
  \ It remains one of my most treasured possessions.\nThe point is that this was all\
  \ very piecemeal and gradual, and therein lay the pleasure\u2014of pursuit and discovery,\
  \ stretching over time. It is a pleasure to a large extent lost. Had I not sworn\
  \ off the booze, I would celebrate it, mournfully, in the spirit of Alfred Jarry,\
  \ with a couple of bottles of wine and a pint of absinthe before breakfast. No wonder\
  \ he was dead at thirty-four.\n[2014-11-05]"
