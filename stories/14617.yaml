text: "For this recipe, I read, you will require a bag of frozen crinkle-cut oven\
  \ chips, six cans of Squelcho!, a turnip, a parsnip, a punnet of Carlsbad plums,\
  \ and the head of a pre-slaughtered pig.\nSo I went to the shops and bought a bag\
  \ of frozen crinkle-cut oven chips, six cans of Squelcho!, a turnip, a parsnip,\
  \ and a punnet of Carlsbad plums. Obtaining the head of a pre-slaughtered pig proved\
  \ more difficult. Not one among the parade of shops I frequented had any such thing\
  \ in stock. The butcher's, which was my best hope, had its shutters down, and a\
  \ scribbled sign posted on the shutters announcing closure due to rampant infectious\
  \ disease, though it did not specify whether this referred to the butcher himself\
  \ or to his supply of meat.\nSitting on a municipal bench, eating one of the Carlsbad\
  \ plums, I wondered if I might make a vegetarian version of the dish, using a pig's\
  \ head fashioned from marzipan. But my skills as a sculptor or moulder have atrophied\
  \ since the heady days of my youth at the Institute For Sculpting And Moulding,\
  \ and I was not convinced my efforts with marzipan would yield anything that looked\
  \ remotely akin to the head of a pig, By the time I had eaten a second Carlsbad\
  \ plum, it was clear to me that I would have to go in search of a pre-slaughtered\
  \ pig and remove its head.\nIt is surprisingly difficult, in this day and age, to\
  \ find a dead pig in a small town. I wandered into the countryside, keeping my eyes\
  \ peeled, peering into bogs and ditches. This proving fruitless, I made my way to\
  \ the top of a bluff, from where I could see for miles around. The climb was onerous,\
  \ and when I reached the summit I was thirsty, so I opened one of the cans of Squelcho!\
  \ and downed it in a single glug.\nGazing out across the countryside, I shouted\
  \ \u201CDead pig! Dead pig! Come out, come out, wherever you are!\u201D\nI hoped,\
  \ by this means, to coax into view a peasant, pushing a wheelbarrow in which rested\
  \ a pre-slaughtered pig. Such a sight is not uncommon in the countryside, or so\
  \ I am given to understand from my reading of various bucolic texts. In the pauses\
  \ between my repeated shoutings, I fell to wondering\u2014if an urban person could\
  \ be urbane, was there an equivalent countryside quality, in which a rustic person\
  \ could be rustice? I had no opportunity to find out, for after an hour or so atop\
  \ the bluff, not a single peasant had appeared.\nThe day was hot, and I noticed\
  \ that my bag of frozen crinkle-cut oven ships was almost entirely thawed. I was\
  \ also conscious that I had depleted my stocks of both Carlsbad plums and Squelcho!\
  \ Unless I returned home in haste, I would end up consuming all the non-pig's head\
  \ ingredients for the recipe, and my day would be wasted.\nI skittered down from\
  \ the bluff, like a gambolling lamb, and headed back through the fields of muck\
  \ towards town. All the while I was racking my brains trying to think of an acceptable\
  \ substitute for the pre-slaughtered pig's head. What did I have in my cupboard?\
  \ Pink wafer biscuits? Peas? A bowl of fayooz? A jar of pickles? Several contaminated\
  \ cocktail sausages? Blubber? Somehow none of these seemed quite right, nor even\
  \ remotely suitable. If I was to vary the recipe, then the least I could do was\
  \ to use something's head.\nBy now I was nearing town, so I looked around me with\
  \ fresh eyes. All I had to do was to spot a living creature, seize it, slaughter\
  \ it, remove its head, and pop the head into my pippy bag along with the bag of\
  \ now unfrozen crinkle-cut oven chips, the turnip, the parsnip, and what was left\
  \ of the cans of Squelcho! and the Carlsbad plums\u2014both further depleted on\
  \ account of peckishness and thirst during my long countryside trudge.\nThere were\
  \ plenty of creepy-crawlies to be seen, but their tiny, tiny heads were hardly fit\
  \ for purpose. Just as I was losing hope, I came upon a pond, at the edge of which\
  \ a toad was flopping about. With a cry of inhuman savagery, I fell upon it, seized\
  \ it, and strangled it. Then I bit off the head, spat it out, wrapped it in a sheet\
  \ of greaseproof paper I happened to have in my pippy bag, and carried it home.\
  \ I would not be able to follow the recipe with one hundred percent accuracy, but\
  \ I felt confident that I could knock together a toothsome supper.\nAlas, I did\
  \ not consider that the toad I pre-slaughtered might be one of those toads that\
  \ is highly toxic, But so it was. As I write these words, I am shaking violently,\
  \ sweating, vomiting, and my own head has swelled to twice its usual size. I fear\
  \ that what I tucked in to, an hour ago, after an exciting time at the chopping\
  \ board, will prove to be my Last Supper.\n[2016-02-29]"
