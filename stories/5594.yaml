text: 'I must apologise for the dearth of decisive prose at Hooting Yard over the
  last while. At first I attributed the absence of fizzing sparks in my cranium to
  my becoming enwrapped in M P Shiel, but I am beginning to think there is another
  cause. My mind is haunted, haunted I tell you!, by the image of those friendly porpoises
  pushing octogenarian surfboard man Dick Van Dyke safely to shore from his imperilment
  upon the sea. Is there any other subject worthy of the attentions of the writer
  of today? I think not. But then, how to treat, in mere prose, an incident that seems
  to me more and more numinous and mythic?

  No doubt I will shake off this sluggishness and return to the fray, but right now
  I feel hampered by my sheer inability to do justice to The Greatest Story Ever Told.
