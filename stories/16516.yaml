text: "You Will Fail, Laurence is the title of a book which appeared to me in my dreams\
  \ last night. It was a children's book, written in very short, staccato sentences,\
  \ and lavishly illustrated with detailed, brightly-coloured drawings\u2014in spite\
  \ of the fact that Laurence spent much of his time enveloped in what my dream insisted\
  \ on calling \u201Cfog-storms\u201D.\nAn additional curiosity was that I was looking\
  \ at a facsimile of the book online, and the dream suggested that the book itself\
  \ did not exist, this digital version being a hoax perpetrated by japesters for\
  \ reasons which must remain unutterably mysterious.\n[2018-05-07]"
