text: "He went to an orchard with his chums\n  And they stole a punnet's worth of\
  \ plums\n  Then they scampered off to their hideaway\n  As the last light faded\
  \ from the day\n  The sky grew dark, then darker, black\n  They transferred the\
  \ plums into a sack\n  Then they tumbled out of their hideaway tent\n  And round\
  \ the town in the night they went\n  Depositing plums from door to door\n  Mischief\
  \ that was against the law\n  For in that town plums had been banned\n  As elsewhere\
  \ in that plumless land\n  According to the king's decree\n  Chim-chim-cheroo, chim-chim-cheree\n\
  \  (The king looked just like Dick Van Dyke)\n  Plums were a fruit he did not like\n\
  \  Why then, you ask, did he allow\n  The orchard's trees, bough upon bough\n  To\
  \ sprout so many Carlsbad plums?\n  Let us ask the little chums.\n  But oh! They've\
  \ vanished in the night\n  Now they're completely out of sight\n  O'er the hills\
  \ and far away\n  As dawn breaks on a brand new day\n  And townsfolk find plums\
  \ on their stoeps\n  They greet them with shrill cries and whoops\n  And hide them\
  \ quick before King Claus\n  Comes on his rounds from house to house\n  If he finds\
  \ a plum his wrath will wax\n  And cause umpteen heart attacks\n  So hide your plums\
  \ well, folks of the town\n  Till human voices wake you, and you drown.\n[2015-03-15]"
