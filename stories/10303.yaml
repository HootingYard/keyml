text: "\nSee Spot. See Spot run. Hear Spot yap. Yap yap yap, says Spot. What a din\
  \ Spot makes! Noisy Spot. See the grump. See the grump throw a pebble at Spot. Hear\
  \ Spot howl. See Spot run.\nSee the grump put the kettle on. See the grump look\
  \ for teabags in the cupboard. Hear the grump moan. See the grump don his coat and\
  \ hat and boots. See the grump go to the corner shop.\nSee the corner shop. See\
  \ Spot outside the door. See dozens of other dogs next to Spot. See the dogs slaver.\
  \ See their fangs. See the grump approach. See the pack set upon the grump. See\
  \ blood and sinew.\nHear the ambulance bell clanging. See Spot preen.\nSee Lars.\
  \ Lars likes tanks. See Lars at the Communist Party meeting. See Lars listen to\
  \ a very very very very very long speech. Rant might be better than speech. See\
  \ Lars clap. See Lars agree with the denunciation of imperialist running dogs. See\
  \ Lars leave the meeting.\nSee Spot. See Spot run. See Lars see Spot. See Lars put\
  \ two and two together. See Lars run. See Lars catch up with Spot. See Lars trap\
  \ Spot in a net. Hear Spot yap. Yap yap yap, says Spot. Noisy Spot. See Lars shove\
  \ Spot into the back of a van. See Lars drive off.\nSee Spot's pack of pals. See\
  \ them slaver. See their fangs. See them run after the van. See the van disappear\
  \ over the horizon. See Spot's pals pant. See Spot's pals overcome with hopeless\
  \ canine despair.\nSee Lars park the van outside a camp. See the sign on the camp\
  \ fence. \u201CPolitical Re-education Camp\u201D says the sign. See Lars drag Spot\
  \ into the camp. See Spot politically re-educated.\n\nThat is one of the stories\
  \ from a compendium of tales for infants published by the Unreconstructed Stalinist\
  \ Press. It is packed with splendid stories, well worth reading aloud to your infant,\
  \ if you have one, or to the wild wind, if not. The tale of Spot is at a rather\
  \ advanced level, but some of the stories in the book are aimed at even tinier infants.\
  \ Among them is a very very very very simple, and simple-minded, Life of Eric Hobsbawm.\
  \ I have not been able to gain permission to reprint it here, though numerous extracts\
  \ have been splattered across the pages of the Grauniad over the past week.\n\n\
  As readers will know, my annual plan is to bash out a Stakhanovite thousand(ish)\
  \ words per day, under a heading beginning with the word \u201COn\u201D. One problem\
  \ with this approach is that certain pieces can outstay their welcome, as I pad\
  \ them out with needless extra paragraphs just to meet the word-count. I am not\
  \ going to make that mistake with \u201COn Spot\u201D, which, frankly, has made\
  \ its point.\nInstead, I could witter on about something else, something either\
  \ significant or insignificant, newsworthy or otherwise. Or, of course, I could\
  \ just shut up. That might be a blessing, and not a blessing in disguise, merely\
  \ a blessing.\nI recently finished reading Francis Spufford's new book Unapologetic,\
  \ with its somewhat unwieldy subtitle Why, despite everything, Christianity can\
  \ still make surprising emotional sense. In an afterword, Mr Spufford tells us that\
  \ he wrote most of the book while sitting at a corner table in a Cambridge branch\
  \ of Costa Coffee. He tells us this for two reasons, one to acknowledge his thanks\
  \ to the staff, which shows admirable good manners, but also to alert us to the\
  \ fact that, as he goes on to say, his book is not the product of any research or\
  \ scholarship, but more a fairly spontaneous outpouring of the thoughts in his head.\
  \ I have never attempted to write in a public space, in that manner, apart from\
  \ on very rare occasions. Being a Diogenesian recluse, I always write at home, or\
  \ home from home. But with the Spufford example before me, I am beginning to wonder\
  \ if I ought not take my trusty laptop and install myself in a coffee bar or on\
  \ a park bench, and do my tippy-tapping there.\nIt further occurs to me that, were\
  \ I to do so, I could obtain a flat cap as beloved by our beggars, and place it\
  \ upside down next to me, accompanied by a sign saying something along the lines\
  \ of \u201CImpoverished Scribbler. Please Give Generously.\u201D Though I suppose\
  \ a truly impoverished scribbler would not come armed with a laptop. Perhaps I shall\
  \ have to revert to my practice of the last century, and write by hand, in a mighty\
  \ ledger. Add a few strands of straw to my hair, and dribble a little, and who knows\
  \ how many bright coins would be tossed into my cap?\nI am still far from my thousand(ish)\
  \ words goal, but that is quite enough for today. I am going to put the kettle on\
  \ and make a cup of tea, hoping there are teabags in the cupboard, and I do not\
  \ have to don coat and hat and boots and go out to the corner shop, there to be\
  \ set upon by Spot and his slavering pack of pals, and left for dead.\n[2012-10-07]"
