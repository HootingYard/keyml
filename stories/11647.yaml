text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I pay homage to the two heroes of my teenage years,\
  \ Samuel Beckett and Robert Wyatt, and how they sort of collided, in spirit, in\
  \ Wyatt's song \u201CMuddy Mouth\u201D.\nDo I still idolise either of them? Probably\
  \ not. Beckett's early novels remain matchless, but he wrote himself into an airless\
  \ and sterile impasse. The later, shorter, fictions lack the comic energy that makes\
  \ Watt a bonkers masterpiece sui generis. As for Wyatt, he still makes some fine\
  \ records, but I can't really uphold as a hero an unreconstructed communist who\
  \ has that curious British middle-class leftie obsessiveness about Israel. (See\
  \ also the late Iain Banks.)\n[2013-06-21]"
