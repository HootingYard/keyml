  \ and has no idea what records to play, asking for tips on what \u201Cthe kids\u201D\
  \ are listening to these days.\nI replied: \u201CIt's not what the kids are listening\
  \ to, it's what they should be made to listen to. I recommend Scriabin's \u2018\
  Poem Of Ecstasy\u2019, Op.54.\u201D\n\nScriabin\_: tiny little hands\n[2011-10-22]"
