text: "[This story was written as part of a fundraising drive for ResonanceFM, and\
  \ broadcast today on Hooting Yard On The Air. Listeners were invited, in return\
  \ for a donation, to provide a sentence, a phrase, a string of words or a name which\
  \ was then incorporated into the text. A list of those who so generously handed\
  \ over their cash follows at the end.]\n\u201CIce Chaos\u201D was the headline in\
  \ one of the newspapers last week. This followed a day when the unthinkable happened.\
  \ A flurry of snow, that settled for about twenty four hours, in the winter, in\
  \ Britain (a country in the northern hemisphere)! Chaos indeed. Or perhaps just\
  \ a cold snap.\nIt's true, though, that extreme or freakish weather conditions seem\
  \ to be on the increase. There were tornadoes in London, Hurricane Katrina, the\
  \ tsunami\u2026 (Incidentally, let us take this opportunity to recall the name of\
  \ a seismologist involved in lack-of-tsunami warnings, Waverly Person.)\nNow, it\
  \ has been pointed out to me more than once that I am hardly qualified to talk about\
  \ extreme weather conditions, as the only weather we get at Hooting Yard is rain,\
  \ sometimes torrential, sometimes a drizzle, and this is true. What my critics fail\
  \ to note is that, ensconced in a cabin somewhere over by Blister Lane Bypass, we\
  \ have a superb forecaster. I speak, of course, of Little Severin, the Mystic Badger.\
  \ When it comes to predicting the weather, Little Severin is second to none, not\
  \ even to the BBC's magnificent Dan Corbett. If you have not watched Dan, visit\
  \ That's The Weather For Now and be amazed. Little Severin the Mystic Badger has\
  \ not yet been blessed with a fan site all his own, but it can only be a matter\
  \ of time.\nBefore we go on, I want to make it absolutely plain that there is neither\
  \ a jot nor scintilla of truth in the rumours that have been flying around. Little\
  \ Severin did not pass through the catflap to the afterlife. In any case, he would\
  \ have eschewed a catflap and sought a more appropriate badgerflap. Flaps for badgers,\
  \ and indeed for stoats, pigs, wild hogs, otters and curlews, some of which are\
  \ flaps to the afterlife and some not, are easily available, for example from Zip\
  \ Nolan's Flappery in Basoonclotshire. (That spelling is correct, as the name of\
  \ the shire derives from basins, not from bassoons.)\nLittle Severin's method of\
  \ weather divination is simple yet brilliant. He is not known as the Mystic Badger\
  \ for nothing. At various times of day or night, he emerges from his cabin and scrubbles\
  \ around in the muck, like badgers do. Then he goes back indoors. Voila! Those able\
  \ to read the omens and portents of his scrubbling know whether tomorrow will bring\
  \ rain, downpour, or drizzle, and not only that, for Little Severin can predict\
  \ more than just the weather. Few people are aware that he forecast both the Cod\
  \ Wars between Britain and Iceland, which lasted for seventeen years, and the Corned\
  \ Beef Wars between Ireland and Argentina, which lasted thirty, among many other\
  \ world-shaking events. As far as I am aware there have not yet been any Oregano\
  \ Wars. Bear in mind that a number of Little Severin's predictions are retrospective,\
  \ for as his name implies, he is only little. And mystic.\nIt is the mysticism which\
  \ so upset Braithwaite, the one-time bus-seat companion of Clytemnestra Duggleby.\
  \ It was Braithwaite, with his pipe, his face, his cheese, his keys, his rissoles,\
  \ his cup, his roll-on-roll-off rim-fire thiamin, and that lip on him, the lip and\
  \ the sculptured boy-hair, Braithwaite who called into question the accuracy of\
  \ Little Severin the Mystic Badger's paw-scrubbling weather forecasts. But what\
  \ did he know? As Clytemnestra Duggleby attested in court after the incident with\
  \ the wheezing scrivener and the invalid postscript font, he spent most of his time\
  \ slumped in front of the radio, like some antediluvian beast, listening distractedly\
  \ to The Sagans, (or Les Sagans) a long-running serial about husband-and-wife team\
  \ Carl and Fran\xE7oise and their thrills, spills, window sills and gas bills as\
  \ they bring up their papoose Boo Boo. The show's theme tune features the papoose\
  \ Boo Boo singing \u201CMeinen Mootzenzimmer\u201D backed by an orchestra of massed\
  \ banjos and ducks with electronic implants. Clytemnestra hated the drama, but adored\
  \ the music, and hummed it as she went about her many and various janitorial doings\
  \ in the town aquarium. It was a submerged aquarium, hewn out of the geological\
  \ strata underneath the abandoned zoo, and it was rife with weird tentacled aquatic\
  \ beings (actual size) including squid. According to the aquarium guidebook, \u201C\
  Squids are mammals, just like plants and clouds\u201D, for the book had been compiled\
  \ by Zip Nolan (he of the Flappery) in a break from writing his pot-boiler series\
  \ of animal-flap related thrillers such as Creepy Raoul And The Partridgeflap, Creepy\
  \ Raoul And The Beeflap (serialised in Harpy magazine), and the million-selling\
  \ Creepy Raoul And The Ineffable Mystery Of The Pentecostalist Cormorantflap, which\
  \ famously begins \u201CRendered placid by the sickening stifle, this cumbersome\
  \ vision of Britney lolled like some spastic hound, a revolutionary Lolita trying\
  \ in vain to calm my wayward reflexes\u201D. Quite why Zip accepted the commission\
  \ to compile the guidebook is as much a mystery as one of his thrillers, for he\
  \ was no lover of waterworld\u2014and I am not talking about the Kevin Costner film.\
  \ Zip was a dry land sort of person, so much so that he avoided ponds and puddles,\
  \ and made daily treks all the way from his Flappery in Basoonclotshire to consult\
  \ with Little Severin The Mystic Badger about the weather, the weather, the weather.\n\
  Ah yes, the weather. Rainfall, wild winds, ice chaos. Cool-a-stoop and a heary blear,\
  \ thunderstorms, tornadoes, forked lightning, slush and frost and winter sunlight,\
  \ Dan Corbett, and Little Severin, the Mystic Badger.\n[Those who donated money\
  \ to help save ResonanceFM, and whose suggested words appear in \u201CIce Chaos\u201D\
