text: "\u201CThe Glass Man came in a variety of forms. He might be a urinal, an oil\
  \ lamp or other glass receptacle, or else he might himself be trapped within a glass\
  \ bottle\u2026 [There is] a sudden plethora of literary Glass Men. One of these\
  \ is Cervantes\u2019 Glass Licentiate, Tom\xC3\_s Rodaja. Obsessed with the idea\
  \ that he is made of glass, and traumatized by any physical contact, he refuses\
  \ to wear shoes or any restrictive clothing. He eats only fruit offered to him in\
  \ a urinal-pouch (vasera de orinal) on the end of a stick, and drinks fresh water\
  \ with his hands. He sleeps outdoors or huddled in some hayloft, takes refuge in\
  \ the country during a storm, and walks in the middle of the street to avoid injury\
  \ from falling roof tiles.\u201D\nFrom An odd kind of melancholy: reflections on\
  \ the glass delusion in Europe (1440\u20131680) by Gill Speak\nThe invaluable Fed\
  \ By Birds provides a link to the article, which is Mr Key's \_recommended reading\
  \ for today. I left a comment on the post saying that I was sure there was a quotation\
  \ buried in the 2003\u20132006 Hooting Yard Archives about a delusionist who believed\
  \ his legs were made of glass. And voila!, here it is:\n\u201CThe other case, as\
  \ related by Van Swieten, in his commentaries upon Boerhaave, is that of a learned\
  \ man, who had studied, till be fancied his legs to be of glass: in consequence\
  \ of which he durst not attempt to stir, but was constantly under anxiety about\
  \ them. His maid bringing one day some wood to the fire, threw it carelessly down;\
  \ and was severely reprimanded by her master, who was terrified not a little for\
  \ his legs of glass. The surly wench, out of all patience with his megrims, as she\
  \ called them, gave him a blow with a log upon the parts affected; which so enraged\
  \ him, that he instantly rose up, and from that moment recovered the use of his\
  \ legs.\u201D\u2014Anon (\u201CAn Oxonian\u201D), Thaumaturgia, Or Elucidations\
