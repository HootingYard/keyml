text: "Continuing an ancient yarn from the last century. Part One is here.\nII. January\
  \ 1911\nI had been marooned on the island for just two days when I discovered the\
  \ gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. They were spattered with blood, rolled\
  \ up and jammed into a rotting wooden casket. I carried them back to my hut to examine\
  \ them. There were about a dozen large sheets, rather frayed around the edges but\
  \ perfectly legible. The top left corner of each sheet had been stamped with an\
  \ official device of the Bolivian administration, showing an escutcheon, a ziggurat,\
  \ the helmet of a conquistador, the hand of God and abbreviations in neat italic\
  \ lettering. The signature of what I supposed to be a petty official had been scratched\
  \ across each of the stamps in mauve ink. I could not understand why they were in\
  \ such good condition. I tacked them up on the walls of my hut, where they rapidly\
  \ grew so familiar that I no longer noticed them. I am no architect, and I had more\
  \ urgent matters to attend to.\nI have never forgiven myself for my stupidity. I\
  \ had been warned not to row my skiff into uncharted waters near the Antarctic Circle.\
  \ Oh, but did I listen as Captain Peabody harangued me? \u201CYou d\u2014-\u2018\
  d fool!\u201D he shouted, his frosty whiskers twitching in the cold morning light.\
  \ I turned for one last look at the ship as I guided my skiff into oblivion. I have\
  \ not seen a human face since that day. Within minutes I was overwhelmed by chilling,\
  \ poisonous mists. The hideous stench of crocuses made me sick to my stomach. I\
  \ let fall the oars. The tholes, tampered with by my enemies, Glubb and Mufton,\
  \ fell to pieces, and the oars floated away, out of reach. I drifted for hours.\
  \ My anorak, with its hood of reindeer hide, froze solid, encasing me so that I\
  \ was unable to move an inch. An auk, or some such feathery ingrate, shat on me\
  \ repeatedly, hovering above my head like a malign shade. I could not move to shoo\
  \ it away. Eventually\u2014mercifully\u2014I passed out.\nWhen I came to I was surrounded\
  \ by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. One of them, with icicles forming\
  \ on the brim of his hat, was solicitously offering me a tin mug of brandy. I took\
  \ a grateful swig, then noticed that his colleagues did not seem so friendly. They\
  \ were glaring at me menacingly. One brandished a rather archaic halberd in the\
  \ air and shouted horrifying words. All of a sudden I became aware that I was aboard\
  \ a huge, shiny boat, its sails billowing, its decks scrubbed clean. I turned to\
  \ look again at the Mountie with the tin mug. For the first time I took in his features.\
  \ It was Mufton! My deadly enemy\u2026.\nThere were other hallucinations, other\
  \ dreams. I shall not repeat them here. Hours, days, perhaps weeks after I had set\
  \ out in my skiff, I came at last to dry land again when I woke to find myself sprawled\
  \ on the beach of this island. Was it yet another phantasm? There were a number\
  \ of ways to find out. I tried three of them. First, I beat my head upon some boulders.\
  \ This caused what seemed like real pain. Then I shovelled handfuls of coarse sand\
  \ into my mouth and attempted to swallow. This caused me to retch uncontrollably\
  \ for some minutes. Almost satisfied, I conducted a third test. Taking from the\
  \ breast pocket of my anorak a small phial, I poured a minuscule quantity of a decoction\
  \ of sandalwood, cresol, gutta percha and pitch into the palm of my hand, held it\
  \ aloft in the salty air, and mumbled incantations and gibberish. Sparks crackled\
  \ in my hair, shot up into the sky, and brought tiny jewels of hail pinging down\
  \ around me. Within seconds they evaporated, and were gone. But now I knew for certain\
  \ that I was wide awake, no longer prey to visions and vapours. Being a resourceful\
  \ sort, I managed to provide myself with adequate food, drink, warmth and shelter\
  \ within a few hours. I began to search my temporary home, and found the gigantic\
  \ Bolivian architectural diagrams. That was over a month ago. I found the remains\
  \ of my skiff, crushed and broken, swept up on some rocks on the northern coast,\
  \ which seems to be the wildest. I have been working hard at my almanack, and at\
  \ keeping my beacons lit.\nLast night, as I hurled dried and matted vegetation upon\
  \ my northern beacon, I was attacked by a swarm of bats. They swooped at me one\
  \ after another, squealing horribly, pecking at my flesh. I fought them off with\
  \ a burning stick, but I was shaken. I ran back to my hut, and blocked up the doorway\
  \ and some of the holes in the walls with mulberry paste. Tonight the bats are back,\
  \ chewing their way frenziedly through the walls. I have on my rickety home-made\
  \ desk a small bag of sulphur bombs with which I hope to fight them off. But timing\
  \ will be crucial. I do not intend to perish.\n[2016-08-20]"
