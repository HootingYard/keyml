text: "So resonant is the phrase \u201Cbanished to a pompous land\u201D that it was\
  \ adopted by one expatriate Hooting Yard devotee as a pseudonym. You will, I trust,\
  \ be familiar with Mr Banished not only for his comments here but for his own blog\u2014\
  where, in the sidebar, you will see the quotation from A Lecture Delivered In The\
  \ Big Tent At Hoon where the phrase appeared.\nAs far as memory served, this 1987\
  \ story was the only incidence of the phrase. However, while researching the Bill\
  \ Hatworn letters, I discovered this earlier usage, which I think dates from about\
  \ 1984\u2014almost thirty long, long years ago. It is a piece called Golden Gate,\
  \ and is a good example of the kind of thing I was writing at that time, before\
  \ the advent of the Malice Aforethought Press. Make of it what you will.\nBanished\
  \ to a pompous land where I knew no one, I set about mending my ways. There were\
  \ flags to be darned, ceremonial shields to be polished, hospitality to be dispensed.\
  \ At night, I was seconded to stand guard at a gateway. The gateway was made of\
  \ solid gold. It was enormous. I sat hunched on a wooden stool, alert and eagle-eyed.\
  \ I brandished my pike at the hint of a passer-by. But few passed by, and in the\
  \ tiny hours I pondered, and pondered hard. There was me, felon, rascal, thief,\
  \ and behind my back a gigantic gateway cast in gold. One night, I took a rasp.\
  \ All was dark and still as I began to shave the gold from the gate. At dawn, my\
  \ satchel held a cellophane packet of gold, and each night I added packet after\
  \ packet. It is dawn again now. In an hour, they will take me away and behead me.\n\
