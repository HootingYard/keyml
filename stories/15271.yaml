text: "Hurrah! I am clearly not alone in my loathing of Twitter. It seems to me thoroughly\
  \ corrosive, of both journalism and public debate more broadly. But we cannot now\
  \ uninvent it, so a way must be found to turn people away from it, and steer them\
  \ towards a more elevated form of social network communication.\nThree cheers, then,\
  \ for Twitsum Twatsum, a new platform launched yesterday. This allows users to couch\
  \ their every banal waking thought in the form of lengthy disquisitions in Latin,\
  \ peppered with classical quotations and abstruse scholarly bagatelles. The minimum\
  \ length of a so-called \u201CTweetum\u201D is ten thousand words, and if a user\
  \ attempts to insert one of those wretched \u201Cemoticon\u201D horrors, the software\
  \ is designed to cause their device (phone, tablet, etc.) to explode with a loud\
  \ bang!, shattering it to smithereens.\nI feel sure that millions around the world,\
  \ who are currently destroying what is left of our civilisation by their endless\
  \ Twittering, will embrace this splendid new service. I have already posted my first\
  \ Tweetum, a crushingly tedious comment on what I had for breakfast made uncrushingly\
  \ untedious by dint of its inordinate length, finely-wrought Latin prose, and quotations\
  \ from Catullus.\n[2017-02-16]"
