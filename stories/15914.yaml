text: "\nWhat once was spineless has now acquired a spine. That old pamphlet Obsequies\
  \ For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning is newly available in an almost but not quite\
  \ facsimile paperback edition. Only twenty-five copies of the original were printed\u2014\
  now every single one of you lot can buy as many copies as you like. Which I hope\
  \ and pray you will. What with Christmas approaching, what better gift to give to\
  \ those dearest to you, including that crumpled Jesuit hiding in the broom-cupboard?\n\
  Go to Lulu to place your order(s) right this minute. It's the sensible thing to\
  \ do.\n[2017-11-17]"
