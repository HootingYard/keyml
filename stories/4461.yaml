text: "\u201CThe [1957 Homicide] Act was criticised on many grounds and in most quarters.\
  \ None criticised it more severely than those \u2018abolitionists\u2019 to placate\
  \ whom the Bill had been brought in. That is perhaps natural enough. For them, it\
  \ abolished too little. The nervous and those who simply saw no reason for change\
  \ (known as \u2018retentionists\u2019, just as non-motorists had, to their astonishment,\
  \ come to be known as \u2018pedestrians\u2019) were dismayed to find that no more\
  \ than a \u2018life\u2019 sentence (averaging ten years) thenceforward awaited those\
  \ who, for the first time as far as the law knew and when not actively engaged in\
  \ robbery, for any reason or none, killed anyone but a policeman or prison officer\
  \ with poison, cold steel, a blunt instrument, drowning, strangulation, smothering,\
  \ burning, gassing, starvation, driving a car at the victim or tampering with his\
  \ brakes, infecting him with a fatal disease, pushing him off a tall building or\
  \ over a cliff, torturing him beyond what his constitution would bear, shutting\
  \ him in with dangerous animals, inducing madness with drugs, hypnotic suggestion\
  \ or sustained ill-treatment and then putting the means of suicide into his hands\
  \ or leading him to believe that a fatal trap is a way to safety, anything in fact\
  \ that a writer of detective stories might plausibly imagine. Apart from prison\
  \ officers and policemen, the victim might be anyone at all, a child or the Queen.\u201D\
