  \ early light. O say can you see him in the airfield canteen, telling us of all\
  \ the places he's been? Widnes and Wivenhoe, a village called Splat\u2014the latter's\
  \ in Cornwall but I'm sure you know that\u2014Totnes and Topsham and Snodland and\
  \ Looe, places without proper airfields too. His goggles are still fastened tight\
  \ round his head as we hang on to every word he has said. We wonder how long he\
  \ is going to stay in our pitiful village, so out of the way. He is chomping his\
  \ breakfast with gusto and vim. He tells us that his name is Tim.\nWhatever became\
  \ of Sopwith Tim? Not a trace remains of him. Tragically, his fate was sealed when\
  \ he came down in that airfield. How could he have known of the villagers\u2019\
  \ lust for burying under soil and muck and dust the corpses of strangers who ate\
  \ their fill in the sinister canteen on top of the hill? He landed in the airfield\
  \ and walked up the tor, in his goggles he passed through the canteen door. He told\
  \ them his tales of venturesome flights, until the poisonous breakfast put out his\
  \ lights. They chopped him to pieces and buried his bones and covered his grave\
  \ with mysterious cones. Then they smashed up the Sopwith and sold it for scrap.\
  \ You won't find that village on any known map.\n[2009-11-15]"
