text: "\nMr Kearney, firing from both barrels, demolishes pseudonyms like a cowboy\
  \ smashing bottles in a bar-room, and woven into his staid bibliographical canvas\
  \ is a host of colourful figures, shorn of their aliases: authors, publishers, illustrators,\
  \ booksellers, who have had a hand in this bizarre trade almost since the invention\
  \ of moveable types. Perhaps the strangest of these is Alphonse Momas, a hack-pornographer\
  \ or \u2018pisse-copie\u2019. . . who wrote no fewer than forty-five books in the\
  \ [Private Case] and whose output was so prolific that he had to use nine pseudonyms:\
  \ Le Nismois, Tap-Tap, Cain d'Abel, L'Erotin, Fuckwell, Un journaliste du si\xE8\
  cle\_dernier, Mercadette, Pan-Pan, and Trix. Mr Kearney tells us Momas was a civil\
  \ servant attached to the Paris police and that he devoted himself to spiritualism\
  \ in later life. I recall reading, in some attack on spiritualism, perhaps one of\
  \ Fr Raupert's spirited diatribes, of a clergyman much given to the practice of\
  \ automatic writing who, to his distress, found his hand suddenly impelled by an\
  \ agency capable only of the grossest indecencies. Each day on awakening from the\
  \ trance into which he had thrown himself, pen in hand, in humble expectation of\
  \ exploring life beyond the veil, he discovered he had been delivered of page after\
  \ page of writings of the lowest and most shocking kind. Perhaps it was the spirit\
  \ of Tap-Tap\u2019, \u2018coming through\u2019.\nTimothy D'Arch Smith, in a review\
  \ of Patrick J. Kearney's The Private Case\_: An Annotated Bibliography Of The Private\
  \ Case Erotica Collection In The British [Museum] Library, collected in The Books\
  \ Of The Beast (1987).\n[2012-11-07]"
