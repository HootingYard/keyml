text: "\nIn Brain Men, his splendid book about the British obsession with pub quizzes,\
  \ Marcus Berkmann refers to the Gleam of Certainty. If, upon hearing a question,\
  \ one of your team-mates exhibits the Gleam of Certainty, there is no need to debate\
  \ possible alternative answers. Your team-mate knows the correct answer, beyond\
  \ all doubt. Even if you think you know different, you must defer to the Gleam of\
  \ Certainty.\nI don't much go to pub quizzes these days, but when I did, I waited\
  \ in vain for one particular question which, had it been posed, I could have met\
  \ with the Gleam of Certainty. But oddly enough no quizmaster ever asked it.\n\u201C\
  Who,\u201D I dreamed of hearing, \u201Cdesigned both the waterworks and the cupola\
  \ of the Observatory in Berne, Switzerland, made a pair of shoes and a rifle for\
  \ Haile Selassie's uncle, sported Ruritanian tinpot attire, and was a pal of Arthur\
  \ Rimbaud?\u201D While everyone else scratched their heads and dribbled, I would\
  \ have the Gleam of Certainty. For I know that the answer to the question is Alfred\
  \ Ilg.\nIlg (1854\u20131916)\u2014or rather, his surname\u2014first struck me because\
  \ I thought it sounded just like the kind of surname I would have devised for a\
  \ Hooting Yard character, particularly in stories written in the pre-Wilderness\
  \ Years of the past century. Ilg would have fitted in very well among Bewg and Ack\
  \ and Vug and Fig and Mat and Nat and Bam and Lip and Obb and Pew and all those\
  \ other curt monosyllabic names of which I was so fond. When one considers, too,\
  \ that he created, from scratch, a functioning postal system, including the design\
  \ of the stamps, it becomes apparent that, had Ilg not existed, I might have had\
  \ to invent him.\nThough he was born and died in Switzerland, Ilg spent many years\
  \ in Ethiopia, working directly for King Menelik, the uncle of Ras Tafari, later\
  \ Haile Selassie. It was the Ethiopian postal system he created, as well as its\
  \ unified currency. He is considered to be the most important European in Ethiopian\
  \ history, a sort of right hand man or, we might now say, chief of staff to the\
  \ King. Arriving in what was then Shawa with his alphabetically extreme Swiss colleagues\
  \ Appenzeller and Zimmermann in 1878, the first task he was given by Menelik was\
  \ to make a pair of shoes. So delighted was the King with the result that he next\
  \ asked Ilg to make him a rifle. Ilg protested that he knew not a jot about the\
  \ manufacture of firearms and, perhaps with an eye to his later dealings with the\
  \ gun-runner Rimbaud, suggested that imported weaponry would be far more efficient\
  \ than anything he could cobble together. Menelik, being a big tough omnipotent\
  \ king, swatted these objections aside and insisted that the Swiss shoemaker make\
  \ him a damned rifle, pronto. Ilg, who clearly knew a lot more about rifle-making\
  \ than he let on, duly made what has been described as a \u201Cpassable rifle\u201D\
  . Perhaps Menelik tested it by taking potshots at passing Ethiopian wildlife. What\
  \ we do know is that the King was so pleased with his new, lethal, toy that he gave\
  \ it pride of place in his armoury and ever after considered Ilg indispensable.\
  \ Indeed, some years later the Swiss with \u201Cthe cuboid head and the scrubbing-brush\
  \ hair\u201D was given the splendidly uncertain title of Counsellor In The Range\
  \ Of An Excellency, before eventually, from 1897 to 1907, becoming the rather more\
  \ clear-cut Ethiopian Minister Of Foreign Affairs.\nThough I am fond of his postal\
  \ system innovations, Ilg was more celebrated in his adopted country for his civil\
  \ engineering projects, including a major railway line, the electrification of the\
  \ royal palace, and the design and construction of the piped water supply to the\
  \ brand new capital of Addis Ababa. The latter has been described by Richard Pankhurst\
  \ (son of Sylvia and great-nephew of Emily) as follows:\nIn 1894, Ilg installed\
  \ the water installations for the Emperor's palace at Addis Ababa. This created\
  \ something of a sensation, as the water, obtained from a spring in high Entoto,\
  \ had to flow down to the Addis Ababa plain beneath it, and then make its way up\
  \ again to the Palace compound, which was located on a smallish hill. People in\
  \ the capital had never seen anything like this, and could not believe that water\
  \ could ever, under any circumstances, flow upward. Menelik, however, was a great\
  \ believer in innovation, and insisted that Ilg should proceed with his project,\
  \ if only to see whether it would work. When the great day for inauguration arrived,\
  \ the tap was turned on\u2014but nothing happened. A European \u201Cfriend\u201D\
  \ had secretly stuffed cotton into the pipe, as Ilg later discovered. This obstruction\
  \ was duly removed, after which Ilg\u2014and his project\u2014were widely acclaimed.\
  \ At least two Amharic poems were composed in honour of the event.\nOne declared:\n\
  \u201CWe have seen wonders in Addis Ababa.\n    Water worships Emperor Menelik.\n\
  \    O Danyew [i.e. Menelik] what more wisdom will you bring?\n    You already make\
  \ water soar in the air!\u201D\nAnd the other ran as follows:\n\u201CKing Abba Danyew,\
  \ how great is he becoming!\n    He makes the water rise into the air through a\
  \ window.\n    While the dirty can be washed, and the thirsty drink.\n    See what\
  \ wonders have already come in our times.\n    No wonder that some day he will even\
  \ outdo the Ferenje {i.e. Europeans].\u201D\nNeither of these poems was the work\
  \ of Ilg's friend Arthur Rimbaud, who by the time of their acquaintanceship had\
  \ long abandoned poetry and was, in the final few years of his life, bitter and\
  \ disillusioned. In 1888, he wrote:\nI'm always very bored, in fact I've never known\
  \ anyone be more bored than I am. And isn't this indeed a miserable existence, without\
  \ any family, without any intellectual activity, lost in the midst of these negroes\
  \ whose lot one would like to improve, and who themselves seek to exploit you and\
  \ to prevent you from realizing any money without long delays? Obliged to speak\
  \ their gibberish, to eat their dirty food, to endure a thousand frustrations on\
  \ account of their laziness, their treachery, and their stupidity. But that's not\
  \ the saddest thing. What's worse is the fear of becoming brutalized oneself, little\
  \ by little, isolated as one is, and so far away from any intelligent society.\n\
  It was not a view shared by Alfred Ilg himself, who thrived in Ethiopian society.\
  \ As he wrote to Rimbaud in 1889:\nIt seems the delights of doing business here\
  \ have driven away completely the little bit of good humour you had left. Look,\
  \ my dear Monsieur Rimbaud, you only live once, so make the most of it and to hell\
  \ with your heirs.\nIlg eventually returned to Switzerland, to Zurich, in 1907.\
  \ He died there, of a heart attack, in 1916, on the seventh of January, which Pankhurst\
  \ tells us was Christmas Day in Ethiopia.\n\nNOTE\_: The quotations from letters\
