  \ to that recipe book I was telling you about a few weeks ago, in connection with\
  \ my participation in a broadcast by Phil Minton's Feral Choir. Mr Minton's recipe,\
  \ Deptford Squat Stir-Fry, is truly sensational.\nThe book is Able To Cook, and\
  \ all proceeds go to the charities Age UK Norfolk and Connects & Co. I command,\
  \ by diktat, all readers to go here, immediately, and buy a copy.\n\nMy thanks to\
