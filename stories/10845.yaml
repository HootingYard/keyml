text: "On this day in 1961 we find the out of print pamphleteer Dobson on his travels:\n\
  Woke up without the faintest clue where I was. It rapidly became apparent that I\
  \ was zipped up tight in a sleeping bag. When I struggled out of it, I saw I was\
  \ in a tent. I have absolutely no memory of going camping. In any case, I hate camping.\
  \ In my experience, one finds that wherever one pitches one's tent soon becomes\
  \ a haven for moles. You fall asleep on a flat patch of ground and when you wake\
  \ up the entire area is riddled with molehills. Usually.\nThat was not the case\
  \ today, as I discovered when, emerging through the canvas flaps, I found that the\
  \ tent had been erected within a hotel room. This was a curious occurrence to be\
  \ sure, and I ransacked my memory to work out why it might be so. Was I so bent\
  \ on travel that I had to double the experience, as it were, first booking into\
  \ a hotel and then pitching a tent within it? It is something I have done only once\
  \ before, when I was young and foolish. Now I am old and wise, at least by my own\
  \ reckoning.\nI abluted in the en suite bathroom and pranced out into the corridor\
  \ in search of breakfast. I noticed something decidedly odd about the sausages and\
  \ the cornflakes, and beckoned a hotel person. Finding myself inexplicably bereft\
  \ of speech, I pointed at the sausages and the cornflakes and raised a quizzical\
  \ eyebrow.\nThe explanation I was given for the oddness of my sausages and cornflakes\
  \ sent my brain reeling. Not only was my tent in a hotel room, but the hotel was\
  \ on a space rocket! I was hurtling at unimaginable speed towards a distant planet.\
  \ And I could not speak because of what the hotel person, who I noticed had special\
  \ breathing apparatus attached to a tinfoil helmet, called \u201Cspace muffling\u201D\
  .\nI had been planning to take a walk in the grounds of the hotel after breakfast\
  \ but clearly this was not feasible, so I returned to my room and, once inside,\
  \ crept back through the flaps into my tent. I set up a portable escritoire, took\
  \ out my jotting pad and propelling pencil, and set about writing a pamphlet. Space\
  \ Age Dobson, I decided to entitle it, immodestly.\nShortly after I had scribbled\
  \ my opening sentence, and was chewing the end of my propelling pencil trying to\
  \ think up a second sentence, the captain made an announcement over the space tannoy.\
  \ Due to the wrong sort of particles in the galaxy, we would have to turn back and\
  \ return to Earth. I scribbled out my title and my opening sentence and continued\
  \ to chew the end of the propelling pencil, which tasted remarkably similar to both\
  \ the sausages and the cornflakes.\nWe bumped back to earth about half an hour later.\
  \ I disembarked and made my way home by bus. I told my inamorata Marigold Chew all\
  \ about my excursion.\n\u201CYou were never much of a traveller, Dobson,\u201D she\
  \ said, \u201CYou always get upset about moles.\u201D\nThat gave me an idea for\
  \ a pamphlet, and I repaired immediately to my escritoire, where I wrote in one\
  \ sitting my pamphlet Are There Any Moles In Outer Space? No, There Are Not!*\n\
