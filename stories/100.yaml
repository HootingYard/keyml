text: "Dobson's Six Lectures On Fruit were among the most highly-regarded of his works,\
  \ held in an esteem that the contemporary reader finds unfathomable. Revisiting\
  \ these pamphlets, it swiftly becomes apparent that Dobson has no idea what he's\
  \ talking about. The revised view of the Lectures is put best by one upstart young\
  \ Dobson scholar, who dismisses them as \u201Cbloviating and orotund\u201D.\nConsider\
  \ the first lecture, On The Putting Of Fruit Into Pies, in which Dobson challenges\
  \ the accepted definitions of both \u2018fruit\u2019 and \u2018pies\u2019, not to\
  \ mention the usual meanings of the verb \u2018to put\u2019. Some critics like to\
  \ pretend that the essay is a precursor of what would become known as postmodernism\
  \ or deconstruction, and inasmuch as it is clueless gibberish, they are correct.\
  \ In his defence, the pamphleteer does not dress up his babble in needlessly complicated\
  \ pseudoacademic jargon. Indeed, his language is direct, even earthy, and littered\
  \ with harsh Anglo Saxon expletives, but he betrays depths of almost unimaginable\
  \ ignorance. The climax of the lecture is supposed to be a recipe for what Dobson\
  \ calls a \u2018prune and lemon pastry explosion\u2019, but the instructions are\
  \ so befogged by witlessness that, to my knowledge, no one has ever succeeded in\
  \ making it.\nThe genesis of the Lectures was an invitation to Dobson from the Orchard\
  \ Persons Of The Port Of Tongs. Those of you familiar with the geography of this\
  \ wretched seaside town will know that it is bounded on its eastern landward side\
  \ by a terrific number of orchards. The Orchard Persons\u2019 Social Club & Community\
  \ Centre was situated in a clearing between a pear orchard and a persimmon orchard,\
  \ and the usual entertainments it hosted were nights of oompah oompah music and\
  \ freakish dancing. Perhaps that is why Dobson chose to deliver his second lecture,\
  \ On The Cutting Of Grapefruit Into Segments Of Equal Size, in the form of rhyming\
  \ couplets, to the accompaniment of a glockenspiel. He was not a skilled glockenspielist,\
  \ nor did he have much understanding of geometry, as those Orchard Persons discovered\
  \ who went home and tried to cut their grapefruit the Dobson way .\nFor the third\
  \ and fourth lectures, Dobson resorted to anecdote and personal reminiscence, recounting\
  \ a series of yarns under the headings All The Plums I Have Ever Eaten, Where I\
  \ Was, And What They Tasted Like and How I Built A Coathanger Out Of Fig Stones.\n\
  Audiences were dwindling by this time, and only three people turned up to listen\
  \ to what was to become the most notorious of the Lectures, the Dialogue Between\
  \ A Raspberry And A Tangerine. Even those who are most severely critical of the\
  \ series are forced to admit that Dobson did a tremendous amount of research for\
  \ this one. He was barely out of the reading room of the Pointy Town Municipal Library\
  \ for weeks on end, poring over books on topics as diverse as fruit, philately,\
  \ biochemistry, aerodynamics, the Peninsular Wars, tugboats, flamenco dancing, and\
  \ the Diet of Worms. But his claims to have penetrated the very essence of a raspberry\
  \ and a tangerine are, quite frankly, ludicrous. Marigold Chew told him so as they\
  \ ate breakfast on a hopeless veranda on the morning before the lecture. Dobson's\
  \ response was to weep great racking sobs into his bowl of Special K. He spent all\
  \ day making revisions to the text, some of which have a certain Jesuitical rigour,\
  \ and by the time he arrived at the clearing between pear and persimmon orchards\
  \ he was brimming with confidence. Preposterous it may be, but the Dialogue Between\
  \ A Raspberry And A Tangerine retains to this day a kind of magnificent declamatory\
  \ brio. Lengthy extracts from the lecture formed the libretto of a concept album\
  \ by prog rock titans Gratuito\xFCs Umlaut.\nThe published edition of Six Lectures\
  \ On Fruit contained only the texts of the first five lectures. Some Dobsonists\
  \ have argued that the sixth in the series never actually existed, that Dobson had\
  \ some kind of brain spasm and that all knowledge of fruit was wiped from his mind.\
  \ E V Van Voo did much to spread this story, in a foolish \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019\
  \ novel, but he overlooks the fact that the pamphleteer was never a man to let ignorance\
  \ stop him expounding at length on any subject he turned his mind to.\nWhat in fact\
  \ happened was that when Dobson arrived in the clearing on the final Thursday he\
  \ found the doors of the Social Club barred and bolted, and no one in sight. Even\
  \ the birds had fled from their perches on the trees that fringed the clearing.\
  \ Dobson took one look at the mighty iron padlock on the door, reached into his\
  \ satchel, took out the notes of his sixth and final lecture\u2014some drivel about\
  \ bananas, or marmalade\u2014and tore them into confetti, and cast them unto the\
  \ winds, and then he trudged off into one of the orchards, and shook a branch until\
  \ pears and persimmons came tumbling to earth, and he sat on a tuffet and gorged\
  \ himself on fruit until he was bloated, and, bloated, he waddled homewards, along\
  \ the lane out of the orchard, body and brain with fruit bloated.\n[2007-03-06]"
