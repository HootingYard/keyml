text: "In the long ago, I was a quiet and well-behaved child, and I rarely got into\
  \ trouble. There was one occasion, however, when I caused something of a hoo-hah\
  \ at my primary school. I did not think then, nor do I think now, that I did anything\
  \ wrong. But I was reprimanded, and my mother was called to take me home, and for\
  \ the remainder of my time at the school I was considered a \u201Cbad egg\u201D\
  . The burning sense of injustice I felt half a century ago has stayed with me, and\
  \ it is fair to say it has cast a pall over my life.\nIt so happened that one wet\
  \ afternoon our teacher Mrs Screech\u2014I think she was related to M. A. Screech,\
  \ the editor of many Penguin Classics and author of Laughter At The Foot Of The\
  \ Cross\u2014asked the class to talk about our pets. One by one my little schoolmates\
  \ stood up and said things like \u201CI have a cat named Tiddles\u201D or \u201C\
  I have a dog called Scamp. He is a collie\u201D.\nWhen it was my turn, I stood up,\
  \ took a matchbox out of my pocket, and said, \u201CI have brought my pet with me.\
  \ He is a pismire and his name is Galahad,\u201D and I opened the matchbox and let\
  \ Galahad skitter about on my desk. For this innocent act, I was reprimanded and\
  \ taken home and ever after seen as a bad egg and a troublemaker and a wretched,\
  \ wretched boy. I was told that the word \u201Cpismire\u201D was unseemly and that\
  \ I was frightening the other children by letting a creepy-crawly loose in the classroom.\
  \ There were other offences, apparently, a long list of them, all bound up in that\
  \ single incident.\nBut Galahad was my pet, and he was a pismire. I cannot recall\
  \ when I discovered that \u201Cpismire\u201D was an archaic term for \u201Cant\u201D\
  , but as soon as I heard it I knew it was suitable for Galahad. He was fully deserving\
  \ of two syllables. He was a valiant little ant, and a loyal one. Every night, before\
  \ I went to bed, I would take him out of the matchbox and put him in the garden\
  \ so he could run about with all the other ants, and when I went to collect him\
  \ in the morning he was always there, with his teeming hundreds or even thousands\
  \ of fellows, and I would pick him up and put him in his matchbox and plop it into\
  \ my pocket. It may be that Galahad was not precisely the same ant every day, though\
  \ it was hard to tell, and I tried not to bother my little head about it. If he\
  \ was the same ant, as I like to think, then he is extraordinarily long-lived, for\
  \ an ant, as I still have him in a matchbox in my pocket as I write these words,\
  \ fifty years after the burning injustice which has cast a pall over my life. It\
  \ is a pall only lifted by Galahad himself. During our long and intense conversations,\
  \ conducted in the language of ants, punctuated by screeching, he offers me solace\
  \ and consolation. He is my pismire pal.\n[2015-01-07]"
