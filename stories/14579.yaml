text: "Binder's first piano concerto had no piano part and was not a concerto. There\
  \ was a piano in the second piano concerto but it was out of tune. The third piano\
  \ concerto was deafening. The fourth gave Binder the heebie jeebies. Binder's fifth,\
  \ or the sixth as it is usually called, was performed in a submarine. Let us draw\
  \ a veil over the sixth, by which I mean the sixth proper, rather than the fifth,\
  \ with which it is often confused, performed as it is in a submarine. The seventh\
  \ is that rare thing, a godawful din. Binder's eighth, ninth, and tenth piano concertos\
  \ are audible only to dogs. The eleventh features an electronically modified cat.\
  \ No animals were harmed in the composition of the twelfth, but the score for the\
  \ thirteenth piano concerto calls for the ritual slaughter of several otters. The\
  \ fourteenth is pithy. The fifteenth is punchy. The sixteenth was dedicated to Stalin.\
  \ The seventeenth is a carbon copy of the ninth. Piano Concerto No. 18 is so vivid\
  \ it makes grown men weep and grown women have an attack of the vapours. The nineteenth\
  \ has the charm of a sausage. The twentieth, the brilliant twentieth, is rudderless.\
  \ Rudders, snapped off boats, are repeatedly and relentlessly bashed on the keyboard\
  \ during the twenty-first. The twenty-second is popular in prisons. The twenty-third\
  \ is full of grace. The twenty-fourth was used in a toothpaste advert. The twenty-fifth\
  \ was written atop an important, stationary mountain. The twenty-sixth is fishy.\
  \ Binder's twenty-seventh is his longest piano concerto, a full performance lasting\
  \ several years. The twenty-eighth consists of a single note, of the performer's\
  \ choosing, plinked twice and plonked once. The twenty-ninth is lost. The thirtieth\
  \ is hidden. The thirty-first tugs at the heart-strings. The manuscript of the thirty-second\
  \ is rolled up and stuffed into a jam jar, and there is still jam in the jar. The\
  \ thirty-third is all that the thirty-second is not. The thirty-fourth gallops along\
  \ like a horse. The thirty-fifth slithers like a worm. Binder said of the thirty-sixth\
  \ piano concerto \u201Cde gustibus non est disputandum\u201D. Raindrops kept falling\
  \ on Binder's head while he was writing the thirty-seventh. The thirty-eighth is\
  \ a biography of Christopher Plummer imagined as a piano concerto. The thirty-ninth\
  \ steers its way through choppy waters towards an island where brutes disport themselves\
  \ in wild abandon before sinking into the sea.\n[2016-02-16]"
