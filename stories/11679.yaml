text: "I went for a stroll around Grimpen Mire. In my pocket, a doll made of wax.\
  \ I paused by a tussock during a break in the rain. I smoked a cigarette and thought\
  \ about Paavo Nurmi, the Flying Finn. It occurred to me that if ever I tried to\
  \ run as far, as fast as him, I would almost certainly collapse from exhaustion.\
  \ Grinding the butt of my cigarette into the muck, I took the doll from my pocket.\
  \ From another pocket I took a batch of pins. Spatters of rain started up again.\
  \ I adjusted my Homburg on my head, as best as I could with the doll in one hand\
  \ and the pins in the other. It was my intention to pierce the doll with the pins\
  \ while jabbering curses. I think it best that I do not divulge the name of the\
  \ cursee. In any case, it hardly matters, because I did not carry out my plan. I\
  \ cast the doll into the mire and dropped the pins in the muck by the mire's edge.\
  \ Then I turned on my heel and sprinted\u2014yes!, sprinted!\u2014back towards my\
  \ shabby hotel room in the town. Long before I reached it, I collapsed from exhaustion.\
  \ Unlike Paavo Nurmi, I had no idea how to pace myself. I am no Flying Finn, nor\
  \ was meant to be. I sprawled there in the muck and the rain fell down on me. I\
  \ let it fall. What could I have done to stop it? I have no power over the weather.\
  \ He whom I had been on the point of cursing, oh, now he has such power. The day\
  \ will come, perhaps, when he will have egg on his face. I am too tired to care.\
  \ I have run out of steam. I fear that, as dusk falls, gruesome creatures will crawl\
  \ from Grimpen Mire, grab me by the ankles, and drag me under. So be it.\n[2013-07-03]"
