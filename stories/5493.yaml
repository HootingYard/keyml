text: "Binder was a highly competitive composer, constantly seeking to outdo his illustrious\
  \ predecessors. He pitted himself against Bach and Borodin, Beethoven and Berg,\
  \ each of whose names, you will note, begin with B, like Binder's own. This fixation\
  \ had its origin somewhere within the pulsing grey jelly of the Binder brain, and\
  \ we know of only one occasion when he directed his efforts to going one better\
  \ over a composer outwith the ranks of the Bs.\n\u201CIf Richard Strauss could write\
  \ Four Last Songs,\u201D he shouted, one day, at his helpmeet, the dwarf Crepusco,\
  \ \u201CThen I shall write five!\u201D\nVery gently, the dwarf Crepusco, who was\
  \ both tactful and wise, pointed out to Binder that he was yet a young man, at the\
  \ outset of his career, and that to be writing his last songs so early was, shall\
  \ we say, a tad premature.\n\u201CWhy the hell should I wait until I am an octogenarian,\
  \ as Strauss was when he wrote his last songs?\u201D shouted Binder, \u201CDammit,\
  \ I shall write mine now, and they will be five in number, not a pitiable four!\u201D\
  \nAnd hardly were the words out of his mouth than the impatient young hothead strode\
  \ out of his chalet and down the mountainside to town, to buy a ream of sheet music\
  \ paper and a biro. Crepusco settled back on the divan, by the oil heater, and devised\
  \ a two-pronged strategy. The first prong was to ensure that, throughout his career,\
  \ however long it turned out to be, he forbade Binder from ever writing another\
  \ song. Were this prong to fail, as well it might, Crepusco reasoned that he could,\
  \ long in the future, scribble a sneaky amendment to the date on the MS of the Five\
  \ Last Songs, and forge parallel documentation if necessary, to confound the historians.\
  \ This was his second prong. Well satisfied, he closed his eyes and dreamed the\
  \ dreams of a dwarvish helpmeet, until Binder returned.\nThe first of the Five Last\
  \ Songs, a glistening jewel, was polished off that very same day. Binder took as\
  \ his model the jaunty cowboy song \u201CThe Man With The Foldback Ears\u201D by\
  \ the Reverend Fred Lane. Indeed, he took the song whole, in an act of plagiarism,\
  \ and then tweaked it here and there, scoring for a piccolo instead of guitar, undermining\
  \ the rhythm, inserting a campfire atmosphere, and translating the words into one\
  \ of the Nordic tongues. It is thought that Crepusco, his head still half in dreamland,\
  \ suggested the wash of melancholy overlaying the finished piece, a melancholy so\
  \ overpowering that most listeners begin to weep during this first song, and do\
  \ not stop until the following four have played out.\nIt was Crepusco, too, who\
  \ provided the words for the second song. He was steeped in the folk tales of his\
  \ Carpathian homeland, and oftentimes over breakfast would regale Binder with a\
  \ story or two. One of his favourites was \u201CThe Fable Of The Carpet Beetle And\
  \ The Submarine Captain\u201D, and he had abridged this long-winded and frankly\
  \ idiotic yarn to a dozen rhyming couplets. Finding the breakfast cereal carton\
  \ upon which he had scribbled his version, the helpmeet dwarf left it upon the rough-hewn\
  \ rustic wooden carpenter's bench where, at this time, Binder liked to compose.\
  \ Inspired, as Crepusco knew he would be, Binder set the words to what he dubbed\
  \ \u201Ca metaphysical oom-pah, heavy on the tuba\u201D. It was quite out of keeping\
  \ with the mood of the first song, but once again Crepusco applied a wash of melancholy,\
  \ this time particularly unremitting.\nMuch has been written about the washes of\
  \ Crepusco, with some critics insisting he has claims to be credited as co-writer\
  \ of the Five Last Songs. He disavowed such lobbying on his behalf, content to remain\
  \ in the shadows. \u201CBinder was a genius,\u201D he wrote, many years later, \u201C\
  And his name would ring down the ages whether I had been his dwarvish helpmeet or\
  \ not. The melancholy washes in which I almost smothered some of his songs were\
  \ involuntary, a by-product of my immeasurable gloom and the confined space of the\
  \ chalet, together with a certain suggestibility in Binder's character, particularly\
  \ when I placed him in a hypnagogic state, using tricksy methods as employed by\
  \ some of the great Carpathian mindbenders of my childhood years.\u201D\nWhich brings\
  \ us neatly to the third of the Five Last Songs, the middle one, known as \u201C\
  The Song Of The Carpathian Mindbenders\u201D. The score calls for three singers,\
  \ a pair of tubas, a fiddle and saw, and thousands upon thousands of handbells.\
  \ The words are deliberately senseless, the music both frightening and gorgeous.\
  \ At forty-five minutes, it is by far the longest of the five songs, though all\
  \ but two of those minutes consist of cacophanous, yet melancholy, bell-ringing.\
  \ In his lifetime, Binder steadfastly refused to allow a truncated version of the\
  \ song, without the bells, to be performed. Since his death, mischievous maestros\
  \ insufficiently awestruck by the Binder legend have chanced it, only to find that\
  \ audiences boo and throw tomatoes and walk out of concert halls en masse.\nThere\
  \ is a persistent rumour, put about by the more irresponsible Binderists, that the\
  \ song was originally meant to end with the howl of a werewolf. Let it be said,\
  \ once and for all\u2014this is bosh.\nThe fourth song, on the other hand, does\
  \ begin with howling, but it is human howling, very human howling. \u201CIt is the\
  \ howl of a soul in torment,\u201D wrote Glib, \u201CTorment which, as the song\
  \ progresses, evaporates, to be replaced by a fathomless sense of sludgy torpor,\
  \ as when one has eaten far too many boiled eggs at one sitting.\u201D This is a\
  \ sound observation, and indeed the song is now popularly known as \u201CThe Eggy\
  \ Breakfast Song\u201D. Its proper title is \u201CHabeat sua fata apis\u201D, that\
  \ is, \u201CA bee has its destiny\u201D, an enigmatic, and possibly meaningless,\
  \ saying Binder had had tattooed on his forearm during his unruly teenage years\
  \ in Cuxhaven. It is the most personal of the five songs, the only one where Binder\
  \ wrote his own lyric, in which he evokes his childhood, on the coast at Cuxhaven,\
  \ staring at the sea until enshrouded by mist. Quite what bees and breakfast have\
  \ to do with it is a mystery, and one the composer was happy to encourage.\n\u201C\
  Binder could be a very mysterious man,\u201D wrote Crepusco, \u201CParticularly\
  \ after eating too many eggs for breakfast. Sometimes his behaviour was so dotty\
  \ I had to inject him with one of my serums.\u201D Sometimes Crepusco could be a\
  \ very mysterious helpmeet.\nYou will be familiar with the fifth and final song\
  \ in the sequence, as it has been wrenched from its context and covered by innumerable\
  \ musicians, including Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, Kinnie The Explorer and Plastic Bertrand.\
  \ It is so well-known that it hardly seems worth writing about. For the rest of\
  \ his life, Binder was able to live comfortably on the royalties earned from this\
  \ one song.\n\u201CWhen the first cheque arrived in the post,\u201D wrote Crepusco,\
  \ \u201CHe immediately strode out of the chalet and down the mountainside to town,\
  \ and went to the bank, and cashed it, and bought a shiny new parpophone.\u201D\n\
  And thus was born the germ of the Sinfonietta For Shiny New Parpophone And Broken\
  \ Eggs. It is not Binder's best-loved work, indeed it is quite unlistenable, but\
  \ many would argue, and have done, in the pages of obscure music journals to be\
  \ found in the waiting rooms of culturally superior dentists, that it was with this\
  \ piece that the \u201CB\u201D (Binder) found his destiny.\n[2010-11-01]"
