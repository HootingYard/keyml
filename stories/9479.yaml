text: "[A slightly shorter version of this piece appeared in June 2006.]\nThere is,\
  \ or may have been, an old superstition that every farmyard has its own fiend. It\
  \ is said that Beelzebub personally allotted each fiend to its farmyard, and ratcheted\
  \ up the fiendishness of his dastardly plan by making the fiends extremely hard\
  \ to identify. So, for example, neighbouring farmyards may have very, very different\
  \ resident fiends\u2014a pig here, an old rusty iron pail there, a one-legged hen\
  \ in one farmyard and a big bright red tractor belching smoke in another. Exorcising\
  \ a farmyard of its fiend is thus fraught with difficulty, for the average countryside\
  \ exorcist, stepping through the gate of a farmyard for the first time, does not\
  \ know where to begin to look.\nThere is great disparity in the fiendishness of\
  \ farmyard fiends, and some diabolists have argued that Beelzebub treated the whole\
  \ matter with an uncharacteristic lack of diabolic concentration. For every farmyard\
  \ that is stricken by an energetic fiend, there are many more that can pass for\
  \ years, even decades, in untroubled bucolic peace. But of course it is the former\
  \ that gain attention. Who can forget the ruination visited upon Scroonhoonpooge\
  \ Farmyard in the 1930s, all those crop failures, diseases, fires, murders, contaminations\
  \ and inexplicable barn collapses, which ceased only when a marauding night-time\
  \ squirrel was captured in a net by Father Dermot Boggis and subjected to the full\
  \ rigour of his holy wrath? It took six months for the exorcist to expel every last\
  \ vestige of fiendishness from the squirrel, leaving the poor bushy-tailed mammal\
  \ thin and shrivelled and exhausted and close to death. And yet, as it was slowly\
  \ revived by the coddling of Old Ma Purgative at her verdant squirrel sanctuary,\
  \ so too did the farmyard flourish anew, with majestic fields of golden wheat, gleaming\
  \ new buckets replacing the old rusty pails, and happy, happy pigs.\nYou would be\
  \ forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard fiends is precisely the kind\
  \ of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed, Marigold\
  \ Chew often pressed him to tackle the topic, supplying the out of print pamphleteer\
  \ with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations of an\
  \ agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the once popular monthly magazine\
  \ Glimpses Of Farmyard Ruin, and wrote many letters to the editor, some of which\
  \ were published and one of which (October 1954) was selected as \u2018Letter of\
  \ the Month\u2019, for which Marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize\
  \ was a very large hog with a brain disease which went on wild rampages through\
  \ the house. Mischievously, the editor of the magazine, who had his own farmyard,\
  \ regularly used the monthly prize to rid himself of his farmyard fiends.\nAh yes,\
  \ note the plural. What happens, you will ask, when a fiend of the farmyard is identified\
  \ and destroyed, whether by slaughter, exorcism, or being given away as a prize\
  \ in a raffle, tombola, or by some other means, as happened with Marigold Chew?\
  \ Did Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard stay fiend-free once its sinister squirrel had its\
  \ demons cast out? How attentive was Beelzebub to the welfare of those he had sent\
  \ to wreak havoc in our bosky rural domains? Were new fiends recruited and trained\
  \ to carry out various infernal farmyard acts of fiendishness? These and other questions\
  \ were answered by Father Dermot Boggis himself, in his deathbed ravings, carefully\
  \ transcribed by his wrinkled old helpmeet, the widow Popsicle. Among the thousands\
  \ of pages she scribbled, we find this startling passage:\nGaaaa\u2026 gaaaa\u2026\
  \ inexplicable torment of the devil's long poking fork\u2026 his ladle\u2026 cataclysm\
  \ of shuddering abasement in the pit\u2026 and when did you last see your potatoes?\u2026\
  \ gaaaa\u2026. have the fields been hoed?\u2026. I see hundreds of cows\u2026 thousands\
  \ of cows\u2026 millions of cows\u2026 brutes\u2026 the flames of the fiery furnace\u2026\
  \ a crow on the branch of a dead tree\u2026 blasts of lightning\u2026 no diesel\
  \ for the tractor\u2026 blight!\u2026 blight!\u2026 worms eating the flesh of resurrected\
  \ horses\u2026 never resurrect a horse\u2026 never\u2026 pass me that feeble lamp\u2026\
  \ puddles of sludge and slop and constant rainfall\u2026 forty days and forty nights\u2026\
  \ flooded fields\u2026 the wheat ruined\u2026 ergot poisoning\u2026 a gruesome figure\
  \ in the shroud of death\u2026 find me a lonely cave\u2026 remote from human kind\u2026\
  \ dark as the midnight grave\u2026 and dismal as my mind\u2026 gaaaa\u2026\nAnd\
  \ with that last brief flash of lucidity, the remembered words of John Eccles (c.1688\u2013\
  1735), Father Boggis relapsed into inanity, the verbatim record covering four hundred\
  \ pages\u2019 worth of the widow Popsicle's palsied pencil-scrawl. The clue to the\
  \ farmyard fiends\u2019 damnable resilience is, I think, in that reference to the\
  \ crow perched on the branch of a dead tree. Think about it. But don't think too\
  \ hard, for then all you will see in your mind's eye is the bird and the branch.\
  \ You need to let the thought of the crow on the branch of a dead tree flit into\
  \ your brain, like a swooping bat, and then out again. You need to think of it with\
  \ the mental equivalent of peripheral vision. You need to try not to think about\
  \ it, just as Gordon Zellaby tries not to think about the bomb he has planted to\
  \ kill the Midwich Cuckoos in John Wyndham's novel of 1957, filmed as Village Of\
  \ The Damned in 1960, directed by Wolf Rilla and starring George Sanders as the\
  \ heroic, academic, and terminally ill Zellaby. Wyndham's fiends are not specifically\
  \ farmyard fiends, but close enough, close enough. Close enough, too, to little\
  \ Martin Amis, as can be seen by comparing these two pictures, one of little Mart\
  \ when tiny, the other a still from the film.\n\n\nBut now the dawn is near. The\
  \ sun will soon be lighting your path to the far flung fields. Go and till and plough\
  \ and harrow, feed your horses and your cows and your happy, happy pigs. You may\
  \ spit upon your farmyard fiend. It will pester you no more. It was only ever a\
  \ superstition, or it might have been.\n[2012-06-19]"
