text: "Yesterday's crumbs of Babinskiana provoked an inundation of letters from female\
  \ readers imploring me to post a picture of the Reverend John Chippendall Montesquieu\
  \ Bellew, he of the head of hair like a great ball of spun white silk, so they could\
  \ print it, cut it out, put it in a frame, and make it the centrepiece of a shrine\
  \ at which they could adore him, as so many women did when he was\u2014becomingly,\
  \ remember\u2014alive. I managed to track the Reverend down here, where you may\
  \ note he is categorised not merely under \u201Ccassock\u201D, \u201Cclergyman\u201D\
  \ and \u201CVictorian\u201D but also \u201Carms crossed\u201D and \u201Ckeen eyed\u201D\
  . Et voila!\n\nNot to be outdone, a plethora of male readers beseeched me, similarly,\
  \ to post a picture of Jules Am\xE9d\xE9e Barbey d'Aur\xE9villy, the boulevard magnifico,\
  \ of the gold-knobbed cane and hand-held mirror, no doubt so they could pick up\
  \ some invaluable tips on personal grooming. As always, I am happy to oblige.\n\n\
  Please note that these pictures are of Bellew and Barbey d'Aur\xE9villy themselves,\
  \ not of the criminal lunatic Babinsky in disguise, first as one, emerging from\
  \ a hovel, then as the other, prancing off a pier.\n[2010-08-20]"
