text: "Important news from Reuters\u2019 Berlin bureau:\nA badger in Germany got so\
  \ drunk on overripe cherries that it staggered into the middle of a road and refused\
  \ to budge, police said yesterday. A motorist telephoned police near the central\
  \ town of Goslar to report a dead badger lying in the road\u2014only for officers\
  \ to turn up and discover that the animal was alive and well, but drunk. Police\
  \ later discovered that the badger had eaten cherries from a nearby tree which had\
  \ fermented and given the animal diarrhoea as well as a hangover. Having failed\
  \ to scare the animal away, officers eventually used a broom to chase it from the\
  \ road.\nWhat the report fails to mention is that the \u201Canimal\u201D in question\
  \ was Little Severin, The Mystic Badger. How in heaven's name do you think he is\
  \ able to make all those devastatingly accurate mystic prognostications? Painting\
  \ him as a simple drunk is a travesty. Little Severin had, of course, gorged on\
  \ fermented fruit as a trusted method of inspiring a shamanistic\u2014or rather,\
  \ shabadgeristic\u2014hallucinogenic trance. I must admit it is not entirely clear\
  \ why he then chose to sprawl in the middle of an Autobahn, imperilled by the products\
  \ of the mighty Teutonic car industry, rather than engage in his usual scrubbling\
  \ about in the muck, but far be it from me to question the ineffable wisdom of Little\
  \ Severin. After all, the last person who did so was turned into a toad, and not\
  \ just a toad, but a blind toad with rickets and pins and needles. As, indeed, was\
  \ foretold, by the Mystic Badger himself, during an earlier cherry binge.\n[2009-07-09]"
