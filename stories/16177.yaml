text: "Tomorrow at the crack of dawn I shall be heading off to a foreign land, where\
  \ I shall prance about like a fool until New Year's Eve Eve. But fear not! You lot\
  \ will not be left bereft and weeping, tormented by a Hooting Yard-shaped hole in\
  \ your souls. Through the [something or other] of technology, daily potsages [sic]\
  \ will be appearing here, even as your favourite impecunious scribbler is thousands\
  \ of miles away from his escritoire.\nNot only will our Advent Calendar continue\
  \ to tock towards Christmas every morning, but from Thursday until 30 December you\
  \ will be treated to Ten Tarleton Tales, one for each day. These are reposts rather\
  \ than new stories, but they take on a fresh\u2014and possibly alarming\u2014significance\
  \ when bundled together as a sort of box set.\nMeanwhile, nearly all surviving episodes\
  \ of Hooting Yard On The Air from 2004 are now available on YouTube, or you can\
  \ go to Mixcloud for an archive of more recent shows.\nTaken together, all of that\
  \ should keep you lot occupied until I return. And though all of this bounty is\
  \ offered freely, it might well be that you feel compelled to offer up a prayer\
  \ of gratitude, invoking the twisted spine of St Spivack, and chucking oodles of\
  \ cash into Mr Key's Paypal coffers.\nA very happy Christmas to you all, and may\
  \ the Lord have mercy on your souls.\n[2017-12-19]"
