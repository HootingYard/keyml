text: "Word of the day\_: Mop.\nMop is the technical term for the stuff that grows\
  \ on top of a Beatle, hence moptop, as in the illustrative phrase \u201Cfour loveable\
  \ moptops who conquered the world\u201D. There are other meanings of mop, both as\
  \ noun and verb, but you know what?, I think I have already told you about them,\
  \ out of turn, when I was meant to be telling you about the word glue, as well as\
  \ boggle and clunk, none of which words I was able to give proper attention to because\
  \ of a flurry of correspondence from pesky reader Wlad Onanugu. See previous Word\
  \ Of The Day entries to relive the full horror.\nSpeaking of Mr Onanugu, he has\
  \ sent me yet another letter. It arrived while I was writing the above paragraph.\
  \ Here is what he has to say for himself:\nDear Mr Key\_: Why are you telling us\
  \ about mop when you said you were going to tell us instead about nap? Also, if\
  \ I am keeping proper track of things, were you not meant to be telling us about\
  \ pencil? I have a few further questions for you regarding parp\u2014as well as\
  \ toot and hooter and tots\u2014but I need to marshal my thoughts very carefully\
  \ before putting pencil to cardboard torn from a packet of breakfast cereal.\nI\
  \ confess myself utterly befuddled by Mr Onanugu's ability to know what I am writing\
  \ about before I have posted it here at Hooting Yard. The awful, terrifying thought\
  \ occurs to me that he might be some sort of phantasmal being whose only existence\
  \ is inside my skull, an emanation of the brain brought on by god knows what.\n\
  At times like these it can be helpful to slosh out the ears by listening to a few\
  \ Beatles hits. By the way, if you are not clear what a Beatle is, you will find\
  \ several references to them elsewhere on Het Internet. One word of warning\_: if\
  \ your source of Beatle lore is the pronouncements on the subject by the late Kenneth\
  \ Williams, please note that \u201Cthat Beatle who married an Asiatic woman\u201D\
  \ was not, as Williams has it, Ringo Starr.\n[2014-07-28]"
