text: "It is, I think, common knowledge that by eating the brains of certain animals\
  \ we can boost our own mental powers. Granted, this is not a practice which has\
  \ won the backing of the greatest living Maestro of the Mind, Tony Buzan, but the\
  \ results can only be described as buzantastic. The difficulty, of course, has always\
  \ been obtaining brains in the first place, and making them edible. Few of us are\
  \ so ruthless that we would consider tearing the brains out of the heads of our\
  \ domestic pets, our cats and dogs and budgerigars, and in any case, those are not\
  \ the kinds of brains that will do much to supercharge our mental abilities. I know\
  \ a poor soul who lived on a diet of budgerigar brains for a week, and he is now\
  \ fit for little else but dribbling and writing features for the Guardian weekend\
  \ magazine. Similarly, although your local zoo will provide a far greater range\
  \ of animal brains, some of them particularly mind-enhancing such as the brains\
  \ of giraffes and of exotic birds, zoos tend to have security guards who will Taser\
  \ you without compunction should you creep towards the enclosures at dead of night\
  \ armed with a jemmy, a skull-slicer, and a spoon. Being Tasered does not improve\
  \ your mental prowess, despite what you may have read in the Guardian. That article\
  \ was written by budgerigar-brains man.\nIt is a very welcome development, then,\
  \ that there is a new section on the delicatessen counter at Hubermann's where lucky\
  \ shoppers can buy a huge variety of boil-in-the-bag animal brains at ridiculously\
  \ low prices. The selection seems to have been made with human mental agility boosting\
  \ as the basic criterion, for we can find the brains of weasels and pigs and crows\
  \ and cows and giraffes and hoopoe birds and jellyfish and starlings and wolves\
  \ and locusts and okapi and trout and flamingos and bears and monitor lizards and\
  \ corncrakes and carp and badgers and hornets and lobsters and ducks and gazelles\
  \ and dozens of others, all conveniently packaged and ready to boil.\nFaced with\
  \ such a cornucopia there is an obvious temptation to go overboard and stuff your\
  \ gob with particularly toothsome brains, such as those of the rooting hog. This\
  \ is why the staff at Hubermann's are fully trained to advise on the government's\
  \ five-a-day guidelines, and hand out free leaflets with every purchase. To maximise\
  \ your brain potential, it is important to follow certain tips:\nHaving said that,\
  \ there may be occasions when, in order to boost a particular area of your mental\
  \ apparatus, a judiciously limited diet can be helpful. For example, you may wish\
  \ to improve your ability to interpret the scores of the more complex madrigals\
  \ of Thomas Weelkes (1576\u20131623), in which case you might want to eat a couple\
  \ of boil-in-the-bag conger eel brains for breakfast and supper each day. Studies\
  \ have shown that there are substances in the brains of all eels, but especially\
  \ the conger, which stimulate those parts of the human mind receptive to madrigal\
  \ score complexities. Admittedly, these studies are very much in their early stages,\
  \ and have yet to be given the imprimatur of any recognised academic institute,\
  \ but the experiments conducted so far have been more than promising. Separate research\
  \ is being done by historians of both eels as food and of choral music on whether\
  \ Thomas Weelkes himself ate the brains of conger eels during his time as a Gentleman\
  \ Extraordinary at the Chapel Royal.\nGenerally speaking, however, unless you have\
  \ a specific mind empowerment scheme you wish to propel forward, it is best to stick\
  \ to those five-a-day guidelines. Make sure you pick up one of the leaflets from\
  \ Hubermann's delicatessen counter, and study carefully the many diagrams in the\
  \ fold-out section so you can learn to tell the difference between the various animal\
  \ brains available, as it must be said that they all look quite similar when packed\
  \ into bags.\nOne final note. Those of you who fret about things can rest assured\
  \ that, according to the latest press release from Hubermann's, boil-in-the-bag\
  \ budgerigar brains are most definitely off the menu.\n[2008-07-25]"
