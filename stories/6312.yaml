  This week at The Dabbler I''ve devoted some words to the ever-intriguing subject
  of birds. Long-time readers will have read it before. I can always be relied on
  for avian lore. Some say I know not of what I speak, which is a monumental bit of
  cheek. Whether it''s a pratincole, a lark, or a linnet, I know all there is to know
  about birds, innit? Oh for the wings, for the wings of a dove! Or the wings of a
  nuthatch if push comes to shove. When push comes to shove I usually fall over. Unlike
  the corncrake, the wren, or the plover. They just fly away, on wings of song. I
  think that''s correct, but I may be wrong. There is so much to learn about birds
  of the air, more than my pea-sized brain can bear. But rather than stumbling through
  mental fog, I read words of wisdom in The Dabbler blog.
