text: "Have I exhausted the topic of the raking of gravel, specifically the raking\
  \ of gravel by an eerie and enigmatic handyman-gardener? I suspect I probably have.\
  \ It is high time we moved on to other topics, ones of more import, even perhaps\
  \ of lesser import, but irrespective of their relative import at the very least\
  \ different, wildly, vertiginously different, from gravel, and its raking. There\
  \ is only so much to be said. Indeed, one might be better occupied actually, physically\
  \ shifting gravel about with a rake than writing about it. Do not for a moment think\
  \ that that has not occurred to me. Had I a stretch of gravel on a pathway outside\
  \ my domain, I would certainly have raked it by now, several times, during the past\
  \ few days. But the pathway outside my domain is covered with flagstones, and I\
  \ own no rake. Thus I am compelled to write about the raking of gravel rather than\
  \ to do it.\nIt is not beyond me, of course, to go sashaying around my bailiwick\
  \ until I spot a pathway with gravel scattered upon it, and to march up the pathway\
  \ to the door, and to hammer my fist upon the door and, when it is opened, to greet\
  \ the person answering and to offer to rake their gravel for them, with the proviso\
  \ that they would have to supply the rake, a rake which I would of course return\
  \ to them immediately after I had finished raking the gravel. I would have to put\
  \ a stress on this last point to avert the possibility that the person might eye\
  \ me with suspicion as a potential rake-thief, my offer to rake their gravel mere\
  \ subterfuge. I like to think I do not cut a thief-like figure, do not carry a fishy\
  \ stink around with me, but some persons are more trusting than others, and if,\
  \ for example, the person at whose door I come calling has suffered recent theft\
  \ of garden implements, I could not blame them for smelling a rat, even if there\
  \ is no rat to be smelled.\nThat entire paragraph, however, hinges on the idea that\
  \ I might be desperate to rake gravel, and I am not. Not really. I do not say that\
  \ I would not spend a happy five or ten minutes raking gravel if the opportunity\
  \ presented itself. But it is not an opportunity I actively seek. I am content,\
  \ as I am sure you have twigged, merely to write about it. I wonder, momentarily,\
  \ whether one might find an equivalence between writing and raking, the writer and\
  \ the raker, words and gravel, but only momentarily. After a moment, I slap my forehead\
  \ with the palm of my hand, with some force, and remind myself that I have all but\
  \ exhausted the topic, and need to move on to fresh pastures, pastures not strewn\
  \ with gravel.\nBefore doing so, however, it will be a good idea to mop up any loose\
  \ ends. Then we can be sure that the raking of gravel has been covered, absolutely,\
  \ with the guarantee that we need never return to it. Otherwise there will always\
  \ be that nagging thought, in the brains of both writer (me) and reader (you), that\
  \ something has been left unsaid, that we will need to return, at some future date\
  \ not yet allotted, to the subject, to wring from it further insights, and this\
  \ thought will necessarily distract us from whatever else it is we ought to be concentrating\
  \ upon. To paraphrase Lord Denning, \u201Cthis is such an appalling vista that every\
  \ sensible person in the land would say that it cannot be right that this thought\
  \ should be allowed to nag at us\u201D. Lord Denning was not talking about the raking\
  \ of gravel, nor of what we might have neglected to say about it, but his remarks\
  \ are apposite, which is why I paraphrased them. I could draw upon other paraphrases,\
  \ and even direct quotations, in my support, were I so minded. But I am not. We\
  \ do not want to string this business out longer than we have to.\nHere, it is nevertheless\
  \ worth asking \u201Chow long might that be?\u201D What if I, or indeed somebody\
  \ else entirely, were to start a blog entitled The Raking Of Gravel, of which the\
  \ only subject under discussion was the raking of gravel? Can one imagine daily\
  \ postages, for years and years, where the topic is ever more thoroughly examined\
  \ and, as beardy postmodernist fatheads would put it, interrogated? You would have\
  \ to be mightily interested in the raking of gravel to read such a blog, and to\
  \ keep reading it, until kingdom come. I am sure there are at least one or two people\
  \ out there who fit the bill. They will be the ones becoming somewhat tearful and\
  \ melancholic as we at Hooting Yard now approach the final mopping up.\nThere may\
  \ be something to be said about the relationship between mopping and raking, between\
  \ the duties of a janitor, with a mop, in a corridor, and those of a handyman-gardener,\
  \ with a rake, on a gravel-strewn pathway. Certainly a janitor can be as eerie and\
  \ enigmatic as a handyman-gardener, and as given to gnomic utterances. They are\
  \ cut from the same cloth, generally speaking, though I think it would be a mistake\
  \ to regard them as interchangeable. Not a serious mistake, with world-shuddering\
  \ consequences, but a mistake nonetheless.\nNote to self\_: find out the difference,\
  \ if any, between a janitor and a janissary.\nChrist Almighty! I have had it up\
  \ to here with the raking of gravel by handymen-gardeners! It remains to acknowledge\
  \ that the original eerie and enigmatic handyman-gardener, Huw Halfbacon, mentioned\
  \ here explicitly the other day, is a character from Alan Garner's The Owl Service\
  \ (1967). It was adapted into a television series in 1969, where Huw Halfbacon was\
  \ played by Raymond Llewellyn. Here he is, on the right, in a still from the series,\
  \ many more of which can be seen here.\n\n[2012-06-27]"
