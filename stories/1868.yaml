text: "If time moved backwards, Hannah More (1745\u20131833) could have been the offspring\
  \ of Dobson and Prudence Foxglove:\nShe helped to initiate a line of publications\
  \ called Cheap Repository Tracts. These were inexpensive chapbooks\u2014softcover\
  \ books of four to twenty-four pages that often were illustrated with woodcuts.\
  \ More embarked on this project, which she said \u201Cbarely leaves me time to eat\u201D\
  , because she was disturbed that contemporary chapbooks were secular works that\
  \ often were ribald. She told Hester Piozzi that \u201C30,000 Hawkers are maintain'd\
  \ by this dissolute Traffic, and Boat loads of it [chapbooks] are sent away from\
  \ the Trading Towns to infect the villages\u201D. She wanted to circulate \u201C\
  Religious and Useful Knowledge as an antidote to the poison continually flowing\
  \ thro\u2019 the channel of vulgar and licentious publications\u201D.\nThe \u201C\
  religious and useful knowledge\u201D would be contained in short stories about \u201C\
  Striking Conversions, Holy Lives, Happy Deaths, Providential Deliverances, Judgements\
  \ on the Breakers of Commandments, Stories of Good and Wicked Apprentices, Hardened\
  \ Sinners, Pious Servants &c\u201D. More wrote many tracts herself (they were published\
  \ anonymously but those marked Z were written by her). The tracts are well written\
  \ and often describe accurately the lives of the rural poor, but they always have\
  \ a predictable ending. According to Anne Stott, More's biographer, \u201Ceverything\
  \ always turns out for the best provided one goes to church and keeps the sabbath\u201D\
