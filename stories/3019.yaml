  \ version of The Birds called The Cows. First they attacked David Blunkett, which\
  \ is understandable, but now they have killed a holidaying veterinary surgeon. Is\
  \ there not authentic Hitchcockian menace in this report?\naround lunchtime they\
  \ heard \u201Can unusual bellow\u201D\n\u201CI looked out of the window and saw\
  \ the lady in question stood up against the wall, she had a stick and was shaking\
  \ it, trying to get the cows away.\u201D\nMrs Johnson said she could see the cows\
  \ \u201Call stood, huddled together in an arch\u201D\nCrowsley's body was found\
  \ leaning against a stone wall and a semi-circle of cows close by.\n\nPhoto by Quilted\n\
