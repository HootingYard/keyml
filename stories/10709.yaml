text: "When Cornelius Cardew went crackers and became, first a Maoist and then a devotee\
  \ of Enver Hoxha of Albania, he repudiated much of his own earlier work and the\
  \ avant garde in general. He turned his fire particularly on Stockhausen, with whom\
  \ he had worked closely as both student and assistant. In The Listener (15 June\
  \ 1972), Cardew published a screed with the self-explanatory title \u201CStockhausen\
  \ Serves Imperialism\u201D. Here are two letters which appeared in the magazine\
  \ the following week:\n\nNo doubt Messrs Britton and Pullman went straight on to\
  \ a list of Enemies of the People who would be the first to be executed when the\
  \ Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)\u2014described\
  \ by Richard Gott as among \u201Cthe more perverse and irrelevant political groupings\u201D\
  \ of the time\u2014ushered in the glorious proletarian revolution.\n[2012-12-27]"
