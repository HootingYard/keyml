text: "A certain Mr Beale, in the nineteenth century, was collecting shells on the\
  \ shores of the Bonin Islands when he encountered \u201Ca most extraordinary animal\u201D\
  \ creeping on its eight legs towards the water. \u201CIt seemed alarmed and made\
  \ great efforts to escape, but the naturalist had no idea of consenting to the termination\
  \ of so unexpected an interview with the odd-looking stranger,\u201D so he trod\
  \ on one of its legs and then grabbed hold of another one and then \u201Cgave it\
  \ a sudden jerk to disengage it\u201D (the poor thing was clinging to the rock).\
  \ \u201CThis seemed to excite it into fury\u201D which by now was hardly to be wondered\
  \ at and, \u201Cit suddenly let go its hold of the rock and sprang on its assailant's\
  \ arm, which was bare, and fixing itself by its suckers endeavoured to attack him\
  \ with its powerful beak. The sensation of horror caused by this unexpected assault\
  \ may be readily imagined. Mr Beale states that the cold and slimy grasp of the\
  \ ferocious animal induced a sensation extremely sickening, and he found it requisite\
  \ to call to the captain, who was occupied in gathering shells at a little distance.\u201D\
  \nI don't know what Mr Beale had expected, but they proceeded to jump on the wretched\
  \ creature and hack it with the boat knife: \u201CIt did not surrender, till the\
  \ limbs by which it so tenaciously adhered were successively cut off.\u201D The\
  \ Victorians were notoriously wasteful of wildlife and we may be sure that Mr Beale\
  \ and the captain did not cook and eat this octopus. We are told that cephalopods\
  \ are unusually intelligent, which strikes us, prejudiced as we are against things\
  \ with tiny heads and eight legs, as strange but caused me to feel some sympathy\
  \ with Mr Beale's antagonist. It must have experienced its own sensation of horror\
  \ on being confronted with a heavily bewhiskered Victorian naturalist.\nfrom Fish,\
