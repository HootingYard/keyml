text: "I lollop. You lollop. He, she, or it lollops. We lollop. You lot lollop. They\
  \ lollop.\nThis is the famous opening paragraph of Dobson's unfinished, unpublished\
  \ novel The Lollopers. It was one of his very few attempts at fiction, a register\
  \ for which he was completely unsuited, as he recognised in his magisterial pamphlet\
  \ A Magisterial Exegesis Of My Resounding Failure As A Novelist, With A Surfeit\
  \ Of Adjectives And A Ham-fisted Watercolour Plate Of Ida Lupino (out of print).\
  \ Dobson wrote:\nWhat I wanted to do in The Lollopers was to drill down, down and\
  \ down, as deeply as anybody could drill, into the very core of lolloping. I thought\
  \ that if anybody was qualified for the task, it was me, for when I am not trudging\
  \ or plodding or gadding or sashaying or stalking, I lollop. I have lolloped along\
  \ canal tow-paths, seaside promenades, important metropolitan boulevards, rustic\
  \ lanes, and many another haunt of the pedestrian. I have lolloped in all four seasons\
  \ of the year, in light and dark, in blistering heat and bitter cold. Indeed, in\
  \ my preliminary sketches for the novel, I planned an entire chapter in which my\
  \ fictional hero, Dabson, a hugely successful pamphleteer, beloved by millions and\
  \ the cynosure of millions more, is seen lolloping during a cold snap.\nA secondary\
  \ aim was to really chew my way through the connecting wire, if there is one, between\
  \ lolloping and lopping. In the domain of trees, for example, lopping is an intrinsic\
  \ part of pollarding. You cannot pollard, say, a willow, such as the pollarded willows\
  \ by the canal just before the level crossing in Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945),\
  \ without doing a bit of lopping. You might use a woodsman's axe or a saw of some\
  \ description, but whatever cutting tool you avail yourself of, lop you will. The\
  \ question is, between the ramshackle shed from where you collect the axe or saw,\
  \ and the willow you are set to pollard, and thus lop, is it imperative that you\
  \ must lollop? Could you, in the throes of hysteria, skip, or even sprint? And if\
  \ you did not lollop, how would this affect the quality of your lopping, and therefore,\
  \ with piercingly acute logic, your pollarding? Actually, that appears to be three\
  \ questions, not one, so the careful reader will spot\u2014perhaps before I did\u2014\
  that I am becoming hopelessly entangled in the thickets of my own creative struggle.\
  \ I am no longer even clear whether I am writing in the appropriate grammatical\
  \ tense.\nWhen one considers that lopping might also apply to the lopping off of\
  \ limbs and\u2014gosh!\u2014whole heads by the armed and armoured henchmen of a\
  \ particularly vindictive mediaeval baron, is it any surprise that my novel juddered\
  \ to a halt after that magisterial opening paragraph? It is not.\nIn the pamphlet\
  \ Dobson confesses that he shoved the manuscript of The Lollopers into a drawer\
  \ where, later that year, around the time of Harold Wilson's resignation as Prime\
  \ Minister, it was eaten by voracious famished beetles.\n[2014-01-26]"
