  \ which died with a full sighing plop, heard her draw back the window-draperies\
  \ with the now remembered and recognisable squeaking drag of the rings on their\
  \ mahogany rod. The light struck Melanie's lids again, but she could not open her\
  \ eyes and meet Adelaide's, who had unlocked the door to the hall and called, \u201C\
  Lizzie! The lavender shovel!\u201D\nThere was a moment's waiting, and then Lizzie's\
  \ heavy steps came up the stone stairs, along the passage and into the room. Now\
  \ curiosity forced open Melanie's eyes, and she saw Lizzie come past her couch,\
  \ holding at arm's length a black kitchen-shovel on which burned red embers.\nAdelaide\
  \ was standing by the fireplace, a small green bottle in her hand. Lizzie held out\
  \ the shovel to her, and on the embers Adelaide dripped liquid from the bottle.\
  \ There was a sizzling, and smoke rose from the shovel, heavy with the smell of\
  \ lavender. Adelaide recorked the bottle, and replaced it behind the jar containing\
  \ the bulrushes, while Lizzie walked about the room, holding the shovel before her,\
  \ waving it slowly from side to side.\nThe embers were nearly grey when she again\
  \ passed by the couch on her way out of the room.\nfrom Marghanita Laski, The Victorian\
  \ Chaise-Longue (1953)\nI want a lavender shovel. A lavender shoveller would be\
  \ handy too.\n[2012-01-14]"
