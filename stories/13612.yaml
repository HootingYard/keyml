text: "Hooting Yard devotee Alasdair Dickson saw a ghost. Fortunately, in spite of\
  \ his terror, he had the presence of mind to take a snap, and he has donated the\
  \ exposure to the Hooting Yard Spirit Photography Bank. Here it is. The spectral\
  \ presence of a ghoulish phantom is clearly visible executing a woohoodiwoodiwoo\
  \ manoeuvre behind an Edinburgh municipal bench.\n\nSpeaking of ghosts, over the\
  \ past few years I have read quite a few books on spiritualism and the paranormal\
  \ in the Victorian era and the first half of the twentieth century. A striking feature\
  \ of the material is that, almost invariably, mention is made of Harry Price. Wishing\
  \ to discover more about the \u201Cveteran ghost-hunter\u201D than was divulged\
  \ in scattered references, I obtained a copy of Search For Harry Price by Trevor\
  \ H. Hall (Duckworth, 1978). What a hoot! The book proves to be a sustained character\
  \ assassination, demonstrating in forensic detail that Price was a liar and a fraud\
  \ and a charlatan, not only in the field of ghost-hunting, but, earlier in his life,\
  \ as a numismatist, archaeologist, and book-collector. It is a highly entertaining\
  \ read, and I have not yet arrived at the part, promised in the preface, where Hall\
  \ examines \u201Cthe ridiculous Brocken affair \u2026 the \u2018magical experiment\u2019\
  \ in the Harz Mountains in which a goat was supposed to change into a beautiful\
  \ youth (which attracted some 800 press reports in over a dozen countries)\u201D\
  . I will tell you all about that in due course.\nHooting Yard Encyclopaedia topics\
