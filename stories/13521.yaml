  Crack open a bottle of aerated lettucewater, toss your pointy hat into the air,
  and cut several brisk capers around your hovel! The cause of your unalloyed glee
  is the publication of a brand new Hooting Yard paperback, the eighth in the series.
  The Funny Mountain is now available for purchase from Lulu, so point your browser
  over there at once, and buy untold copies of what they are already calling the most
  important sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose since oo-er missus I don''t know
  when!
