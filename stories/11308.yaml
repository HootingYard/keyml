text: "After they scooped out most of my vital innards, the surgeons replaced them,\
  \ bish bosh, with artificial substitutes made from an amalgam of rubber and wire\
  \ and tin and concrete. Then they sealed up the slicings they had made earlier,\
  \ lifted me from the operating table and placed me into some sort of translucent\
  \ jelly pod. There was a blinding flash of light, and the next thing I knew I was\
  \ back in bed, in my pyjamas, in my chalet. I unbuttoned my pyjama jacket, expecting\
  \ to see scars, but I was completely unmarked.\nNow, from that account you might\
  \ think I am describing the experience of being abducted by aliens. We know how\
  \ fond they are of carrying out intrusive surgery for their own, inexplicable, purposes.\
  \ Forgive me if I gave the wrong impression.\nWhat actually happened was that I\
  \ woke up, in my pyjamas, in my bed, in my chalet, and I felt distinctly peaky.\
  \ Usually when I am peaky I swallow a glug of Dr Baxter's Invigorating Syrup, but\
  \ on this particular morning my peakiness was beyond the pale. One glug, then another,\
  \ did nothing to alleviate it, and so I thought it best to consult my doctor. As\
  \ it happens, his surgery is perched rather higher on the mountain slope than is\
  \ my chalet, so by the time I staggered into the waiting room I was peakier still.\
  \ I was so peaky it beggared belief.\nWhen, eventually, I was ushered in to see\
  \ Dr Fang, he took one look at me and gawped.\n\u201CGood heavens!\u201D he cried,\
  \ \u201CSeldom have I encountered so peaky a patient! You may be mere minutes from\
  \ death! Watch, now, as I prod my metal tapping machine and summon a hot air balloon\
  \ to ferry you immediately to my exciting new research clinic, even higher up the\
  \ mountain slope! There, my unpaid interns will carry out innovative and as yet\
  \ untested procedures to obliterate all traces of peakiness and have you back on\
  \ your feet in no time!\u201D\nMoments later, the door crashed open and a gaggle\
  \ of said unpaid interns, all white coats and stethoscopes and burning enthusiasm,\
  \ dragged me out and into the basket of their hot air balloon. At this point my\
  \ peakiness reached a new pitch, and I lost consciousness. You know the rest.\n\
  The point is, do I feel any better? It is difficult to judge. Admittedly, I have\
  \ not yet attempted to rise from my bed, in part because my new artificial innards\
  \ seem to weigh considerably more than those they replaced, which I last saw tossed\
  \ into a wastepaper bin in the clinic. Perhaps the extra weight I now carry is Dr\
  \ Fang's ruse to build up my strength. But I am also rather alarmed at the terrific\
  \ rate at which my rubber and wire and tin and concrete heart is pounding. I seem\
  \ to have acquired the metabolic rate of a squirrel. That may be a good thing, of\
  \ course. I will be more alert, though constant quivering may prove socially ruinous.\n\
  Dr Fang has promised to pay me a chalet visit tomorrow, during which he will check\
  \ my progress. I might also find out if there is any truth in the rumour that his\
  \ experimental surgery is in fact part of a dastardly plan to breed a race of half-men,\
  \ half-robotic automata, with whom he intends to conquer the world. I think I saw\
  \ on his bookshelf a ringbinder on the spine of which was written Plan For Global\
  \ Dominion Through The Agency Of Robot Squirrel People. I think I had best ask him\
  \ if I could borrow it.\nNow I think I will eat some nuts for supper.\n[2013-04-23]"
