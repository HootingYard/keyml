text: "Devoted Hooting Yard readers will know that I am always on the lookout for\
  \ boosters of one sort or another. I don't really care what kind of booster it is,\
  \ nor what it is designed to boost. It is entirely possible that my enthusiasm is\
  \ stirred simply by the sound of the words \u2018boost\u2019 and \u2018booster\u2019\
  . Broadly speaking, I would aver that you can't go wrong if your sentence has \u2018\
  boost\u2019 in it somewhere, even if it doesn't make sense. A while ago I employed\
  \ a team of boffins to analyse the neurological responses of a sample of listeners\
  \ to my radio show. The results, though difficult to clarify, buried as they were\
  \ in a vast pile of inexplicable data, showed that magnificently pleasurable brain-tinglings\
  \ occurred in seven out of ten people, irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity, sock-size,\
  \ religious or political affiliation, or the angle of the ears towards their wireless\
  \ sets, whenever I declaimed in sprightly tones the words \u2018boost\u2019 or \u2018\
  boosters\u2019. Further tests showed that the remaining three out of ten persons\
  \ each had so-called \u201Cboffin-resistant brains\u201D. Apparently the cranial\
  \ integuments of such persons send out weird wild rays or beams of some unknown\
  \ substance which thoroughly beflummox the dials and chockers on the boffins\u2019\
  \ conical scanners.\nAnyway, I make mention of all this because, during my stay\
  \ in Flanders, I could barely walk ten paces upon the cobbles without seeing this\
  \ excellent example of booster-related advertising.\n\nI am not sure whether Belgacom\
  \ boosts anything else, in addition to het internet, but I wouldn't put it past\
  \ them.\n[2010-03-15]"
