text: "You can now read Gilbert White's The Natural History Of Selborne as a daily\
  \ blog, so I recommend that you do so. One of my favourite items in the Hooting\
  \ Yard library is a 1946 book entitled The Portrait Of A Tortoise\_: Extracted From\
  \ The Journals And Letters Of Gilbert White, edited by the great Sylvia Townsend\
  \ Warner. She went through the Journals and simply extracted all the references\
  \ to Mrs Snooke's tortoise Timothy, from 1st November 1771 (\u201CMrs Snooke's tortoise\
  \ begins to scrape an hole in the ground in order for laying up\u201D) to 1st June\
  \ 1793 (\u201CTimothy is very voracious\_: when he can get no other food he eats\
  \ grass in the walks\u201D). Perhaps, after Jubilate Agno, I may read this on the\
  \ radio next time there is a special edition of Hooting Yard On The Air.\n[2008-01-16]"
