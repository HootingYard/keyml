  In The Dabbler this week I examine in breathtaking detail the parliamentary career
  of a scientist who dabbled in politics. Dabbler he may have been, but Sir Isaac
  Newton''s record as a parliamentarian, albeit brief, was exemplary, and ought to
  serve as a model for some of the more loathsome specimens at large in the Palace
  of Westminster today.
