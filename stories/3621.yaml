text: "\u201COverhead, there would sound a curious wailing from Father Bernard's room.\
  \ When I first heard this sharp cry break out on Monday morning, I had supposed\
  \ that Father Bernard was either having a fit or whipping himself. [Eric] Gill,\
  \ however, had quickly reassured me. It appeared that Father Bernard's vocal cords\
  \ were not all they might be and that he was studying a new method of voice-production,\
  \ invented by a man called White, in which the vocal cords were dispensed with altogether\
  \ and the notes produced by expansion and contraction of the sinuses. This did not\
  \ seem to me possible.\u201D\nRayner Heppenstall, Four Absentees (1960)\n[2010-01-04]"
