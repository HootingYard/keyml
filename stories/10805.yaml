text: "In a staggering breakthrough, tiptop gruntologists at a gruntorium high in\
  \ the Swiss Alps have discovered what they believe is the diary of the Grunty Man,\
  \ that terrifying figure from children's nightmares. As we all know\u2014and shudder\
  \ as we remember\u2014the Grunty Man dwells in a filthy and horrible and tenebrous\
  \ cave. Weirdly, some sort of magnetic anomaly in the rock of which the cave is\
  \ composed has led to the Grunty Man's bestial grunts being somehow recorded and\
  \ preserved for posterity. By harnessing state-of-the-art 78 rpm shellac disc engroovement\
  \ technology, the Swiss gruntologists were able to transfer the awful sounds from\
  \ the dank interior of the cave on to state-of-the-art 78 rpm shellac discs (with\
  \ grooves). A collection of said discs has now been made available to the public,\
  \ so we can all relive the terrors of our totdom.\nHere is a transcript of the Grunty\
  \ Man, musing upon his existence on this day in 1913, and 1813, and 1713, and 1613,\
  \ and back, back, at intervals of a century, to before the earth was formed, to\
  \ before the universe existed, to before time and space, back to that unimaginably\
  \ distant past when the Grunty Man was all there ever was, or ever is, or ever will\
  \ be:\nGrunt grunt grunt.\n[2013-01-11]"
