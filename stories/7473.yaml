text: 'Appended to The Dabbler review of a history of the Ordnance Survey, a comment
  from Jonathon Green to serve as a warning to surveyors, geometers, and cartographers
  everywhere:

  My favourite, if tragic cartographical story is retailed by Graham Robb in The Discovery
  of France (2007). It tells how a young geometer, employed in surveying a country
  that was still highly localised and almost wholly unmapped, arrived in the village
  of Les Estables, some forty miles (and about 400 years) away from Lyons. The villagers,
  simple peasant folk with their simple peasant ways and beliefs, assumed that this
  outsider, never seen in their village, must therefore be a herald of Satan. They
  hacked him to pieces.
