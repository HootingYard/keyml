text: "Call me Puff. I live in a cave by the sea, the very same sea where Ahab sailed\
  \ in the Pequod. As it happens, I am a dragon, and not just any dragon, but a magic\
  \ dragon. So put that in your pipe and smoke it. For many long years, I used to\
  \ entertain paper children with my conjuring tricks, accompanied by my lovely assistant\
  \ Winifred. Well, I say \u201Clovely\u201D, but in truth Winifred was a bit frumpy\
  \ for a magician's assistant. She had a pronounced stoop and a runny eye. However,\
  \ she was game for anything, including being sawn in half or plunged into a cauldron\
  \ of boiling tar\u2014or appearing to be, of course\u2014and there are very few\
  \ magician's assistants willing to live in a damp dark cave by the sea with only\
  \ a dragon for company, albeit a magic one.\nWinifred was also absolutely indispensible\
  \ in enticing the paper children from the various seaside villages thereabouts to\
  \ our magic shows. Had I lolloped into the square, snorting fire and thumping my\
  \ great scaly tail upon the ground, the paper children would have run screaming\
  \ and their paper parents would have bustled them indoors and bolted and shuttered\
  \ their hovels. The hovels, too, were of paper, so I could simply have set them\
  \ ablaze with a couple of fiery belches, but I am civic-minded as well as magical,\
  \ and in any case laying waste the land has never appealed to me, on aesthetic grounds\
  \ as much as anything. I much prefer to frolic in the autumn mist.\nThe magic shows,\
  \ which we held either outside the cave or in cow-strewn fields between the villages,\
  \ were always a great success. My prestidigitative skills are second to none, though\
  \ I say so myself, and certainly the envy of the magic dragon community. It took\
  \ long years of practice, manipulating my fearsome great talons, to shuffle a deck\
  \ of cards so that it was in perfect order, both numerically and alphabetically,\
  \ ace to king, clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. I killed or wounded countless\
  \ doves and rabbits before I learned to handle them with utmost delicacy. That was\
  \ before Winifred joined me, and I had to fight off attacks by vengeful doves and\
  \ rabbits singleclawed. Later, on the very rare occasions when I was set upon by\
  \ the great-great-great-grandchild of a dead or maimed dove or rabbit, Winifred\
  \ smashed it on the head with her spade and shoved it in her cooking pot. This was\
  \ the same pot I would chuck her into under the illusion it was brimful of boiling\
  \ tar, a trick which always elicited gasps and nausea from the paper children. Ah,\
  \ those were heady times!\nAlas, Winifred and I eventually had a falling out. It\
  \ was my fault. I felt in need of a holiday, and hired a boat with a billowing sail,\
  \ planning a sight-seeing voyage to take in the crumbling coastal castles of kings\
  \ and princes who had been exiled following the revolution. I knew the sea was riddled\
  \ with pirates, and it was for that reason I chose as shipmate a paper child instead\
  \ of Winifred. Far better, I reasoned, that in the event of a pirate attack I could\
  \ sacrifice a child made of paper, and flimsy tissue paper at that, than risk my\
  \ lovely, frumpy assistant coming to harm. She did not see it like that, insisting\
  \ she was no shrinking violet and would give any piratical waylayer the same treatment\
  \ she meted out to doves and rabbits. But I was stubborn, in that characteristic\
  \ way of dragons, magical or not, and on a misty autumn morning the paper child\
  \ and I set sail, leaving Winifred seething with rage on the shore, glugging from\
  \ a bottle of doves\u2019 blood. I did not expect, in the long months of our voyage,\
  \ that every single pirate ship we encountered, and there were many, would lower\
  \ its skull-and-crossbones flag at our approach. Even the most ruthless pirate,\
  \ it seemed, became a quaking knock-kneed jelly at the sight of me, roaring my name\
  \ and snorting fire.\nWhen I grew tired of having kings and princes bowing to me\
  \ from their dilapidated castle ramparts, we set sail for home. Winifred had upped\
  \ sticks and gone, I knew not where. And, at the very moment we docked, a sharp\
  \ gust of wind blew my shipmate paper child away, away, he was swept away and gone.\
  \ I was alone. Never again would I frolic in the autumn mists along the cherry lane.\
  \ I retired to my cave, where I slouch in the gloom, shuffling cards to pass the\
  \ time, surrounded by the bones of doves and rabbits, and memories of happier days.\n\
