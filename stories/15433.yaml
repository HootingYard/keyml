  Dear Mr Key, I am pleased to hear you are heading abroad for a well-earned break.
  I would be most interested to know what you are taking with you as holiday reading.

  Though I am leaving very early tomorrow morning, I have not finished packing. However,
  a couple of items have already found their way into my suitcase: the current issue
  of Fortean Times, and a new collection of essays by Gertrude Himmelfarb.
