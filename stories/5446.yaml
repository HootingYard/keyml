text: "Here is a simple method of grasping a weasel by the scruff of its neck, hypnotising\
  \ it, and having it do your bidding.\n1. Take one weasel.\n2. Grasp the weasel by\
  \ the scruff of its neck and hold it so that its head is no more than a couple of\
  \ inches from your eyes.\n3. Stare into the eyes of the weasel while making hypnotic\
  \ weaselly noises.\n4.\_Place the weasel carefully on your floor and issue it with\
  \ a command.\n5. When the weasel returns from its mission, pick it up by the scruff\
  \ of the neck, and repeat step 3, substituting hypnotic weaselly noises with antihypnotic\
  \ weaselly noises.\n6. Release the weasel.\nWhat could be simpler than that? Indeed,\
  \ the only difficulty most students find is to think up a suitable command for the\
  \ hypnotised weasel to obey. Experience shows that tasks involving high-pitched\
  \ squealing and savagery are likely to achieve the best results. If you are of a\
  \ squeamish disposition, command the weasel to do its slashing and slaughtering\
  \ in another room, or even outside, in your front garden, if you have a front garden.\
  \ Try to remember that weasels will attack most effectively if set upon organisms\
  \ of equal size, or smaller than themselves, although in certain circumstances they\
  \ can prove lethal and terrifying pitted against larger beings, particularly if\
  \ such beings are tethered to a stout post.\nAdvanced students may wish to attempt\
  \ the grasping, hypnotising, and commanding of more than one weasel at a time.\n\
  Even more advanced students can omit steps 5 and 6, and maintain a pack of hypnotised\
  \ weasels primed and ready to do their bidding in perpetuity, or until the weasels\
  \ die.\n[2010-10-21]"
