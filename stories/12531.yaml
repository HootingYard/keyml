  \ and Hove Herald that he had taken a lease of the St Ann's Well pleasure gardens\
  \ \u2026 By April 1893 Smith had been able to \u201Csupplement the many natural\
  \ attractions\u201D of St Ann's Well by the addition, among other things, of a monkey\
  \ house, a gypsy fortune teller, swings and see-saws for the children, and by popular\
  \ lectures and demonstrations by himself.\nIn May 1894 Smith announced that St Ann's\
  \ Well had become one of the most popular amusement resorts in Britain. He claimed\
  \ that \u201Cclose to 3,000 visitors\u201D had paid 3d. for admission on Whit Monday.\
  \ The attractions now included captive baboons, an exhibition of dissolving views\
  \ \u201Cby means of long-range limelight apparatus\u201D, and juggling and trapeze\
  \ artists.\nSmith's advertisements in the Brighton and Hove Herald and the Brighton\
  \ Gazette on 7 and 9 June 1894 announced a \u201CBALLOON ASCENT AND THRILLING PARACHUTE\
  \ DESCENT by Neil Campbell, Australia's \u2018Demon of the Air\u2019\u201D, on the\
  \ following Saturday, augmented by trapeze, juggling, and balancing acts. \u201C\
  The Demon of the Sky\u201D, it was said, \u201Cwill perform his wonderful leap from\
  \ the sky from a height of one mile by means of a parachute.\u201D We may perhaps\
  \ think that a mile was an exaggeration. However, in the event, Smith created more\
  \ of a sensation with his \u201CDemon of the Air\u201D than he could have anticipated.\
  \ \u201CHalf of Brighton\u201D, apparently, \u201Cwas wild with excitement\u201D\
  , because during the ascent of the hot-air balloon the Demon had been unable to\
  \ free himself to make his spectacular parachute descent. After drifting over the\
  \ town the balloon, with the Demon still attached, crashed into Brighton cemetery.\
  \ The Demon, it was stated, broke a tombstone by the force of his descent, but was\
  \ miraculously uninjured.\n[Let us leap forward sixty years\u2026]\nWhen the National\
  \ Film Theatre was opened on London's South Bank in 1957, the [British Film] Academy\
  \ invited the now ninety-three-year-old Smith as a guest. He was presented to Princess\
  \ Margaret, met Gina Lollobrigida and other stars of the film world, and was given\
  \ a picture of the theatre by Lord Hailsham.\nTrevor H. Hall, The Strange Case of\
