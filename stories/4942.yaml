text: "In an email I sent to someone the other day, I confessed to having an inner\
  \ Guardian-reading armchair lefty airhead nestling within me, adding the parenthetical\
  \ comment that he needs to be bludgeoned into submission. In truth, my inner woolly-brained\
  \ \u201Cprogressive\u201D loon has been shrivelling up slowly but surely for quite\
  \ some time. It won't take a bludgeon to bash him utterly senseless.\nAnd indeed\
  \ it has not, for today I have finally understood the obvious superiority of capitalism.\
  \ I really have.\nThere is, this week, in Trafalgar Square, a temporary maze. It\
  \ is open from 11 am to 8 pm, entrance is free, and it is a proper maze, with wrong\
  \ turns and dead ends and, best of all, hedges higher than Mr Key's head. I blundered\
  \ through it this afternoon, in sunshine after rainfall, and enjoyed myself, if\
  \ not quite immensely, then enough, enough. It was a diverting fifteen minutes,\
  \ wandering through a high hedge maze slap bang in the middle of London.\nMy pleasure\
  \ was soured only by the fact that, on the blue plaques dotted hither and thither\
  \ within the maze, I noted a number of typos. \u201CFred Astair\u201D without a\
  \ final \u201Ce\u201D? A misplaced apostrophe in \u201CBeatle's\u201D? I have come\
  \ to expect such slapdashery, but still it never fails to depress me. The blue plaques\
  \ themselves, by the way, give a clue to one reason for the maze being there in\
  \ the first place, which is that it's meant to boost the West End as a tourist hub.\
  \ There are no advertisements for particular shops or restaurants, just the general\
  \ message that this is a place of great historical interest which now, in the twenty-first\
  \ century, is the world's finest and most popular retail \u2018n\u2019 leisure complex\
  \ (or words to that effect). That's one reason why the maze is there, the other\
  \ being, of course, simply to provide people with the chance, for a week, to walk\
  \ through a maze in Trafalgar Square, at no cost, and without having your forehead\
  \ tattooed with a corporate logo or some such marketing ploy.\nBut why has it made\
  \ me embrace the joys of capitalism? For one very simple reason. Those high hedges,\
  \ of which the maze is constructed, were provided by RentaHedge! What a fantastic\
  \ idea for a business, one which\u2014crucially\u2014no bureaucrat or civic functionary\
  \ would ever think up. I am lost in admiration for the entrepreneurial genius who,\
  \ one day, thought: \u201CI know! I will make a living by renting hedges to people!\u201D\
  \nSadly, my own talents do not lie in that direction, so I shall continue to plough\
  \ my lonely furrow of prose. Pansy Cradledew suggested starting a business called\
  \ RentaSedge(warbler), renting sedge warblers to those who needed a temporary sedge\
  \ warbler, but a bank manager took one look at the business plan and reached for\
  \ his bludgeon. Heigh ho.\n[2010-08-04]"
