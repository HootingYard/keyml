text: "\nOver at The Dabbler this week I turn my attention to some lesser-known editions\
  \ of the Bible, as noted by Isaac Disraeli in his Curiosities Of Literature. This\
  \ is a splendid work, highly recommended to Hooting Yard readers. To take just one\
  \ essay at random, in Amusements Of The Learned, we are told that\nWhen Petavius\
  \ was employed in his Dogma Thealogiea, a work of the most profound and extensive\
  \ erudition, the great recreation of the learned father was at the end of every\
  \ second hour, to twirl his chair for five minutes.\nTwirling in a seated position\
  \ wasn't good enough for Cardinal Richelieu. He preferred \u201Cviolent exercises;\
  \ and he was once discovered jumping with his servant, to try who could reach the\
  \ highest side of a wall.\u201D\nMost amusing, perhaps, is the manner in which Baruch\
  \ Spinoza liked to unwind from his philosophical labours:\nAfter protracted studies\
  \ Spinoza, would\u2026 unbend his mind by setting spiders to fight each other; he\
  \ observed their combats with so much interest, that he was often seized with immoderate\
  \ fits of laughter.\n[2011-09-23]"
