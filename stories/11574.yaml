  \ Indeed, it was so far off what anybody might consider normal that I would happily\
  \ sign an affidavit to the effect that Norm was absolutely bonkers.\n\u201CNorm,\u201D\
  \ I said to Norm, some little while after making his acquaintance, and having witnessed\
  \ a plethora of oddities, \u201CIt seems to me that your parents, when naming you,\
  \ chose whatever the nominal opposite of the mot juste is. Whatever possessed them\
  \ to dub you Norm? Were you, perhaps, normal as a babe in arms, only latterly striking\
  \ out in wild and unhinged directions?\u201D\n\u201CSigismund has unlatched his\
  \ pig door,\u201D said Norm, as he writhed within his straitjacket. You see what\
  \ I mean? His reply made no sense whatsoever. He was a very trying companion. I\
  \ am as loyal as the most loyal of puppies to my friends and acquaintances, but\
  \ I think I might have broken things off with Norm, through sheer exasperation,\
  \ were it not that I, too, was enswathed in a straitjacket, and shared with Norm\
  \ the padded cell from which neither of us are ever likely to be released.\n\n[2013-06-08]"
