  \ of \u201CMr Key, you probably know more about ornithology than anyone else in\

  \ else leaning insouciantly against this mantelpiece. Tell me, what is your favourite\
  \ of all the birds of the air?\u201D\nMy reply to this will vary from day to day,\
  \ hour to hour, even minute to minute, but if I were to be asked right now, I would\
  \ say \u201CA mordant heron\u201D.\nAnd lo!, here is a particularly mordant heron,\
