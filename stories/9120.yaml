text: "Here you are, not a shadow above or below or around you, even though surrounded\
  \ by enormous objects; there is no more trail, no more precipices and gorges, no\
  \ more sky; there is nothing but whiteness to think of, to touch, to see or not\
  \ to see, it being impossible to raise your eyes from the white pointlessness [l'emb\xEA\
  tement blanc] which you take to be the middle of the trail; impossible to raise\
  \ your nose into the raging of the north wind; your eyelashes and moustache forming\
  \ stalactites, your ears nearly torn off, your neck swollen. Without your own shadow,\
  \ and the telegraph poles which follow the supposed trail, you'd be as hopeless\
  \ as a sparrow in the oven.\nArthur Rimbaud, in his account of crossing the Alps\
  \ in 1878, quoted in Somebody Else\_: Arthur Rimbaud In Africa 1880\u201391 by Charles\
  \ Nicholl (1997)\n[2012-05-10]"
