text: "\u201Cthe Knyght was a little less than Perfect, and his horse did not have\
  \ a metabolism\u201D\nPreamble to A Knyght Ther Was by Robert F Young, Analog Science\
  \ Fact & Fiction, July 1963\nThis fragment from a pulp magazine was almost certainly\
  \ the inspiration for Dobson's important pamphlet, published, as it happened, on\
  \ the day of the Kennedy assassination in Dallas, entitled, somewhat inelegantly,\_\
  \ A Comparative Study Of The Metabolisms Of The Horses Of Three Knights Of The Realm\
  \ (out of print).\nDobson begins with a bold declaration:\nIn this pamphlet I am\
  \ going to prove, beyond all reasonable doubt and brooking not one whit of opposition,\
  \ that the horse of Sir Lancelot, of the Arthurian Round Table, had the metabolism\
  \ of a squirrel, that the horse of his confr\xE8re Sir Bedivere had the metabolism\
  \ of a gnat, and that the horse of Sir Cloudesley Shovell, of later date, had a\
  \ metabolism so extraordinary and anomalous that science has yet to account for\
  \ it. My findings, which will completely overturn the accepted wisdom regarding\
  \ the metabolism of horses ridden by knights of the realm, are backed up by a wealth\
  \ of evidence only I have had the energy and diligence to winkle out of the documentary\
  \ record, and this evidence, in the form of a vast scholarly apparatus of footnotes\
  \ and citations and what have you will be published in a separate series of pamphlets\
  \ in due course.\nIt never was\u2014so the reader has to take on trust forty pages\
  \ of wild assertion, idiotic wittering, equine ignorance, and frankly incomprehensible\
  \ gibberish, all of it written, as we would expect, in majestic sweeping paragraphs.\
  \ The pamphlet is remembered today chiefly for the much-anthologised passage about\
  \ nosebags crammed with hay which, though factually inaccurate, has served as a\
  \ model for many a novice pamphleteer. I well remember the way these words of Dobson's\
  \ transfixed me in my early, faltering stabs at composition, and how for years I\
  \ was unable to write a finished piece without inserting something about hay in\
  \ nosebags, no matter what my ostensible subject. It must be said that editors were\
  \ kind to me. The inevitable rejection letters I received gently pointed out that\
  \ I could easily delete the hay in nosebags stuff without fatally undermining my\
  \ prose. But, oh!, I was young and headstrong and I would not countenance the change\
  \ even of a comma to what I had scribbled so decisively with my propelling pencil\
  \ on my tablet of notepaper. In those days, I cared not to pound the keys of a typewriter\
  \ like Mancunian polymath Anthony Burgess. My hero Dobson was a scribbler, and so\
  \ would I be.\nThe truth of it was, of course, that without acknowledging the fact\
  \ I was being smothered under the Dobson cushion, as so many beginners have been.\
  \ My salvation, and the prompt that allowed me at long last to cast the cushion\
  \ aside, was a commission from a now defunct magazine, Beasts Of Barnyard And Field,\
  \ to pen an article about nosebags crammed with hay. I worried and fretted at it\
  \ so much that, in nervously gnawing my propelling pencil I managed to get a sliver\
  \ of lead stuck in my craw, and had to be enclinicked. It was the morning of my\
  \ fifty-first day there when, sprawled on my balcony gazing at the mountains, I\
  \ sensed a tiny yet dramatic shifting of the integuments within my head, and knew\
  \ at once that I was free of Dobson. The mighty out of print pamphleteer will always\
  \ remain my idol, but on that morning in that clinic on that balcony I knew it was\
  \ possible for me to plough my own furrow.\nI tore up the few puny pages of prose\
  \ I had written about hay in nosebags, and instead submitted to the magazine a piece\
  \ about swill for pigs. Alas, later that day, listening to the news on the wireless\
  \ in the clinic's rumpus room, I learned that the skyscraper housing the offices\
  \ of Beasts Of Barnyard And Field had collapsed after attack by woodworm and weevils\
  \ and tiny, tiny beings that bore through cement, and the magazine had ceased publication.\
  \ Ha!, I thought, I am not going to let that stop me. And it has not.\n[2010-08-01]"
