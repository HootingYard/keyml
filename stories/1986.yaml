text: "The less variety there is at that meal [breakfast], the more is the danger\
  \ from any single luxury; and there is one, known by the name of \u2018muffins,\u2019\
  \ which has repeatedly manifested itself to be a plain and direct bounty upon suicide.\
  \ Darwin, in his Zoonomia, reports a case where an officer, holding the rank of\
  \ lieutenant-colonel, could not tolerate a breakfast in which this odious article\
  \ was wanting; but, as a savage retribution invariably supervened within an hour\
  \ or two upon this act of insane sensuality, he came to a resolution that life was\
  \ intolerable with muffins, but still more intolerable without muffins. He would\
  \ stand the nuisance no longer; but yet, being a just man, he would give nature\
  \ one final chance of reforming her dyspeptic atrocities. Muffins, therefore, being\
  \ laid at one angle of the breakfast-table, and loaded pistols at another, with\
  \ rigid equity the Colonel awaited the result. This was naturally pretty much as\
  \ usual: and then, the poor man, incapable of retreating from his word of honour,\
  \ committed suicide,\u2013having previously left a line for posterity to the effect\
  \ (though I forget the expression), \u201CThat a muffinless world was no world for\
  \ him: better no life at all than a life dismantled of muffins\u201D.\nThomas De\
  \ Quincey, \u201COn the Temperance Movement of Modern Times\u201D, Tait's Edinburgh\
