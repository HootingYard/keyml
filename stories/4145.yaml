text: "Oi, FK!, writes Tim Thurn in his usual artless manner, I am appalled at the\
  \ latest evidence of your slipshod treatment of your loyal readers. I very much\
  \ welcomed the Daily Bird Challenge instituted here on Monday, and I was even preparing\
  \ to acknowledge that perhaps you do know a little bit about ornithological matters\
  \ and are not a hopeless avian dumbkopf, as I have always suspected.\nI threw myself\
  \ heart and soul into the first of your challenges, removing my binoculars from\
  \ the satchel wherein they have been gathering dust since the last century and stalking\
  \ up and down and around my bailiwick hoping to spot a bluebird and a robin and\
  \ a starling and a grackle. I took a bag of reconstituted meat paste sandwiches\
  \ and a flask of piping hot tea, because I was in this for the long haul, and could\
  \ see myself being stranded on a hillside come dusk. I even had a picnic blanket\
  \ thrown over my shoulder, just in case. I spent the whole bloody day in the open\
  \ air, in spite of the weather, though I would have liked nothing better than to\
  \ be curled up on a rug in front of a roaring fire, like a well-kept dog.\nNow,\
  \ perhaps it is my own fault that I failed to check the noticeboard outside the\
  \ civic hall, and thus was unaware that Monday had been designated And No Birds\
  \ Sing Day by the authorities, in honour of some ailing palely loitering knight-at-arms\
  \ of yesteryear. Clearly, the birds, their tweeting and chirruping forbad, voted\
  \ with their wings and scarpered to a different neighbourhood for the day. That\
  \ is why I failed to spot any birds at all, let alone the ones designated in your\
  \ challenge. But I repeat, I put a great deal of effort into it, at some risk to\
  \ my holistic wellbeing, for I suffered much, much!, until I eventually threw in\
  \ the towel, towards midnight, and staggered home in a state of mental and corporeal\
  \ exhaustion. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I was impugned by a\
  \ peasant while trudging around the lake, upon which even the sedge was wither'd.\n\
  I slept in fits and starts, having hideous dreams about eggs and monkeys, but when\
  \ I rose on Tuesday and plunged my head into a bucket of icy water, I consoled myself\
  \ that the day would bring a new bird challenge. I resolved to be better prepared,\
  \ and before dawn I took a little hike over to the civic hall to check the noticeboard\
  \ for any further bird-related announcements. There were none, but to be on the\
  \ safe side I popped in to Old Pa Kropotkin's Bleach \u2018n\u2019 Fags \u2018n\u2019\
  \ Periodicals Kiosk to pick up the local newspaper. Back home before cock-crow,\
  \ I read This Particular Bailiwick's Daily Intelligencer front to back, line by\
  \ line, twice, over a breakfast of goat milk slops. I did not want a repeat of yesterday,\
  \ with its crushing humiliations, so I meant to be absolutely sure I was apprised\
  \ of all pertinent local ornithological goings-on before I took the daily Hooting\
  \ Yard bird challenge.\nThere was much to take in, for the Intelligencer was packed\
  \ with special reports from its tiptop bird reporter, young Dagobert Stalin, whom\
  \ I had had the pleasure of meeting a couple of times as he scampered around the\
  \ bailiwick with his reporter's pad and propelling pencil. There on page one was\
  \ his \u201Ctake\u201D on the success (or otherwise) of And No Birds Sing Day. Apparently\
  \ a crone on Rolf Harris Avenue had failed to muffle her sandpiper, while an avant-gardist\
  \ at the Conservatoire had insisted on rehearsing his Passacaglia For Three Electronically\
  \ Enhanced Buffleheads. Both crone and composer were to be shot at dawn, I learned,\
  \ and in fact, in the distance, I heard the firing squad. Turning to page two, Stalin\
  \ had a piece about owls, from which I could wring no sense, since he had written\
  \ it aping the style of Terry Eagleton. The next few pages were taken up with the\
  \ dismal and the mundane. I was looking for announcements and pronouncements of\
  \ a birdy hue, and eventually found some on the inside back page. Today, Tuesday,\
  \ I learned, there was to be an ostrich display in the park, the unveiling of a\
  \ tin blue-footed booby statue in the market square, some flummery with birdseed\
  \ and tea-strainers at the Opera House Annexe, and, according to Dagobert Stalin,\
  \ the expected appearance, in the sky, of an enormous flock of migrating swallows,\
  \ a flock so enormous it would blot out the sun. On the back page there was a small\
  \ item about a siskin, an attractive little finch, caged, and to be presented as\
  \ a prize to the orphanage's Orphan Of The Month. Spooning the last of my goat milk\
  \ slops down my gullet, I was well pleased and confident that I was as prepared\
  \ as ever I could be for today's bird challenge.\nInside the technohut, I depressed\
  \ the computer knob which began the process of \u201Cpowering up\u201D my Macrohard\
  \ Vista operating system. In just a few hours now, I would be plugged in to the\
  \ information superhighway of which Mr Blair had spoken with such enthusiasm. It\
  \ seemed so long ago, that bright new dawn when things could only get better. I\
  \ could barely remember whether it was before or after Peter Mandelson sported a\
  \ dapper moustache, and which guide dog accompanied David Blunkett at the time.\
  \ Thinking these thoughts, with time to kill, and savouring the goaty residue coating\
  \ my tongue, I strode manfully over to the town gymnasium to throw medicine balls\
  \ around to no apparent purpose and to spend a while on the simulated bobsleigh\
  \ machine. At the corner, as luck would have it, I bumped into young Dagobert Stalin,\
  \ but he was in a frantic hurry, rushing to some newsworthy incident, of which I\
  \ would no doubt read in tomorrow's paper.\nPT done and puffed out, not unlike a\
  \ magic dragon, I returned to the hut and was pleased to see steam hissing from\
  \ the i-ears of the computer, a sure sign that only a few minutes remained before\
  \ its \u201Cbooting up\u201D would be complete. I was already booted, of course,\
  \ and, in anticipation of the challenge to come, had changed into my dappled dun\
  \ suburban rambling fatigues. I sat at the console and waited for the Brian Eno\
  \ Parp. As soon as it parped, I logged in to what our Belgian chums call het internet\
  \ and steered my way to Hooting Yard.\nWhat did I find? A picture of Rolf Harris,\
  \ never unwelcome, but of no ornithological interest. Some drivel about Whittaker\
  \ Chambers and Alger Hiss. The mention, twice, of \u201Ccertain swooping birds of\
  \ the air\u201D momentarily sparked my interest, but no challenge was laid down\
  \ to the reader, so I spat into my spittoon and moved on. Nineteenth century twaddle\
  \ about mesmerism, followed by blather about soup. And? And? Nothing else. No Daily\
  \ Bird Challenge.\nThis, Key, is what I mean when I rebuke you for being slipshod\
  \ and abusing the devotion, sometimes fanatical, of your readers. It has become\
  \ quite clear that you know not a jot about ornithology, but I am now forced to\
  \ ask if you actually understand what the word \u201Cdaily\u201D means. The newspaper\
  \ I pored over with beetle-browed concentration is This Particular Bailiwick's Daily\
  \ Intelligencer. Has the significance of that title occurred to you? It signals,\
  \ even to a halfwit, that the paper comes out every day. Not just now and then.\
  \ Not just on rainy days. Not just when young Dagobert Stalin, its tiptop bird reporter,\
  \ can be bothered to clamber out of bed a-morning and arm himself with his reporter's\
  \ pad and propelling pencil and charge with the vigour of youth through the streets\
  \ and fields keeping his eyes peeled for all manner of birdy activity. No, the paper\
  \ appears, on Old Pa Kropotkin's kiosk counter and on other counters, and on shelves\
  \ and racks and turny display carousels, every single day of the year, except of\
  \ course for important festive holidays when everything shuts down. I speak of days\
  \ such as the anniversary of the Hindenburg disaster and Yoko Ono's birthday. But\
  \ otherwise, \u201Cdaily\u201D means \u201Cevery day\u201D. How in the name of the\
  \ Prince Elector of Tantarabim can you claim as much for your bird challenge? It\
  \ appeared once, and then the very next day it was gone, pfft!, vanished in the\
  \ haze, like that conjuring trick with the magnet and the whisk and the attractive\
  \ little caged siskin which I have been practising in my leisure hours.\nI am surely\
  \ not the only reader to find myself sorely tested by your cavalier ways, Mr Key.\
  \ Why don't you just come clean and admit that what little you know of birds could\
  \ be written, in very big bold block capitals, on a pinhead, and the head of a tiny,\
  \ tiny pin at that, not one of the bigger ones you find in shops for the larger\
  \ pin and pointy thing user? Were you to confess as much, believe me, you would\
  \ feel refreshed, as if washed in the blood of the lamb and wrapped in a towel of\
  \ unimaginable fluffiness. If I were not due back at the gymnasium in a few minutes\
  \ to put all the medicine balls back in their cupboards and to tweak and grease\
  \ the simulated bobsleigh machine in readiness for the orphans\u2019 simulated bobsleigh\
  \ cup tie needle match tomorrow, I would happily draft a mea culpa for you, with\
  \ vivid and sprightly wording you could be proud of. As it is, I and the rest of\
  \ your despicably ill-treated readers will have no choice but to entrust you to\
  \ do the decent thing.\nYours, more in sorrow than in anger, well, in truth, boiling\
  \ with rage and minded to strangle a few hens to assuage my fury, Tim Thurn.\nMr\
  \ Key would like it to be known, and not just known but shouted from atop tors and\
  \ promontories, that he has no intention of writing any such confession of avian\
  \ ignorance, now or at any time in the future, for he knows all there is to know\
  \ about birds, from the Arabian babbler to the barn owl to the carrion crow to the\
  \ dotterel to the Egyptian goose to the fulmar to the Goliath heron to the hoopoe\
  \ to the indigo bunting to the jackdaw to the kittiwake to the little stint to the\
  \ moorhen to the nightjar to the Oriental pratincole to the pin-tailed snipe to\
  \ Quetzalcoatl, albeit a mythical serpent, but with feathers, with feathers, like\
  \ a bird, to the ruddy shelduck to the sombre tit to the twite to the upland sandpiper\
  \ to the veery to the whimbrel to the yellow-bellied sapsucker, yea, unto Zino's\
  \ petrel. Shame on you, Tim Thurn, shame on you! Next you will be telling me there\
  \ is a bird beginning with X. There is not.\n[2010-03-31]"
