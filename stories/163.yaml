  \ of hideous shrubs and rivers. My eyes reject its colours\u2014it's grey and blue\
  \ in blotches. I keep a vinegar-stained map rolled up in my little suitcase. Proud,\
  \ majestic, grand, I leapfrog in the darkness. My torch shines on my map, a map\
  \ made by an idiot. One day I'll lose my thread. I'll stumble in the bracken, catch\
  \ fire, blaze, then smoulder. That land was just a rumour.\n[2007-05-17]"
