text: "So \u2026 this book I am working on, due out next year. It will be a whole\
  \ volume of Brief Lives, as posted recently in The Dabbler. As I explained there,\
  \ the entries are not really \u201Clives\u201D, in the sense of potted biographies,\
  \ but a single snippet about each subject, which could be an amusing or bemusing\
  \ fact, an anecdote, a quotation by or about the person, or in some cases simply\
  \ the preposterously lengthy title of a book they have written, as in this case:\n\
  Mowbray, Jay Henry (American writer, 20th century). Mowbray was the author of the\
  \ 1912 book Sinking Of The \u201CTitanic\u201D, Most Appalling Ocean Horror With\
  \ Graphic Descriptions Of Hundreds Swept To Eternity Beneath The Waves; Panic Stricken\
  \ Multitude Facing Sure Death, And Thrilling Stories Of This Most Overwhelming Catastrophe\
  \ To Which Is Added Vivid Accounts Of Heart-Rending Scenes, When Hundreds Were Doomed\
  \ To Watery Graves, Compiled From Soul Stirring Stories Told By Eye Witnesses Of\
  \ This Terrible Horror Of The Briny Deep.\nMuch of the material I have gathered\
  \ thus far (including Mowbray) lies buried deep within the Hooting Yard archives,\
  \ but of course my research is taking me further afield, to dusty tomes on library\
  \ shelves. And you lot can be of assistance, by bringing to my attention bits and\
  \ bobs of information that deserve a place in the book.\nThe criteria for entries\
  \ are that they are\_: amusing or bemusing (or both) ; true, or at least attested\
  \ as true by a reliable source ; not widely known (though I realise that is a subjective\
  \ judgement) ; and, oh, there was a fourth, but I cannot recall what it was.\nI\
  \ know all of you will be panting with eagerness to assist Mr Key in his endeavours,\
  \ and all assistants will be thanked by name in the book. Please send your suggestions\
  \ to hooting [dot] yard [at] gmail [dot] com. As this will be a scholarly work of\
  \ reference, please give details of your sources.\nMeanwhile, here, for your amusement,\
  \ is another brief life lugged out of the archives:\nNaz\xE1rio de Lima, Ronaldo\
  \ Lu\xEDs (Brazilian footballer, b. 1976). During a football match in 2009, referring\
  \ to a footballer named Rolando, a television commentator wondered \u201Chow long\
  \ is it since Ronaldo was marked by an anagram of himself?\u201D\n[2013-10-18]"
