text: "They must have been putting something in Fatima Gilliblat's cornflakes. We\
  \ don't hear from her for many a moon, but now, hard on the heels of her latest\
  \ recipe comes this thrilling letter:\nPantsil, Mr Key! [This is the form of greeting\
  \ Fatima always uses, for reasons lost in the fog of doo-dah.] Finding myself at\
  \ a loose end, and unnerved by inexplicable clunks, I thought it would be a good\
  \ idea to bury myself in research. As you know, I have long been fascinated by mystic\
  \ foods devoured by mystic beings, so I trotted off to the library chat \u2018n\u2019\
  \ snack zone to consult some reference works. I was wondering what, if anything,\
  \ was the connection between the manna sent down from heaven for the Israelites,\
  \ in the books of Exodus and Numbers, and ambrosia, as munched by the gods of Greek\
  \ mythology. It had also occurred to me that there may be a link to the mess of\
  \ pottage for which Esau sells his birthright in Genesis. Yes, yes, I know most\
  \ authorities would have it that Esau's mess was some kind of lentil stew, but I\
  \ have never been afraid to fly in the face of accepted wisdom, nor indeed to fell\
  \ sacred cows with my girly fists. I learned a thing or two from the matchless deeds\
  \ of Tiny Enid, you know.\nHaving silenced the chattering, snacking, mobile phone\
  \ wittering teenage hoi polloi with a thunderbolt, I spent some happy hours poring\
  \ over mystic texts. Pore, pore, pore, that was me, brows furrowed in concentration,\
  \ scribbling notes in my recipe ideas notebook.\nYou will be pleased to hear that\
  \ the result of my studies is a brand new Fatima Gilliblat recipe for what I was\
  \ going to call The Goo Of The Gods, until it struck me that violent monotheists\
  \ might take the usual umbrage and I could end up being cast into the outer darkness\
  \ or beheaded. So I settled on God Goo. For the time being I have decided to keep\
  \ it a secret formula, like Coca Cola, although I hasten to add that God Goo has\
  \ nothing whatever in common with that tooth-rotting fizzy pop.\nMy current plan\
  \ is to unveil this wondrous goo in a ten-part television series called Fatima Gilliblat's\
  \ Spiritually Uplifting Goo Kitchen Paradise. Keep an eye on the schedules.\n[2009-07-16]"
