text: "The organic things\u2014Italo-Semitico-Mongoloid\u2014inhabiting that awful\
  \ cesspool could not by any stretch of the imagination be call'd human. They were\
  \ monstrous and nebulous adumbrations of the pithecanthropoid and amoebal; vaguely\
  \ moulded from some stinking viscous slime of earth's corruption, and slithering\
  \ and oozing in and on the filthy streets or in and out of windows and doorways\
  \ in a fashion suggestive of nothing but infesting worms or deep-sea unnamabilities.\
  \ They\u2014or the degenerate gelatinous fermentation of which they were composed\u2014\
  seem'd to ooze, seep and trickle thro\u2019 the gaping cracks in the horrible houses\
  \ . . and I thought of some avenue of Cyclopean and unwholesome vats, crammed to\
  \ the vomiting-point with gangrenous vileness, and about to burst and inundate the\
  \ world in one leprous cataclysm of semi-fluid rottenness.\nFrom that nightmare\
  \ of perverse infection I could not carry away the memory of any living face. The\
  \ individually grotesque was lost in the collectively devastating; which left on\
  \ the eye only the broad, phantasmal lineaments of the morbid mould of disintegration\
  \ and decay . . a yellow and leering mask with sour, sticky, acid ichors oozing\
  \ at eyes, ears, nose and mouth, and abnormally bubbling from monstrous and unbelievable\
  \ sores at every point . . .\nH. P. Lovecraft describes Manhattan's Lower East Side\
  \ in a letter to Frank Belknap Long, cited in H. P. Lovecraft\_: Against The World,\
  \ Against Life by Michel Houellebecq (1991, 2005)\n[2013-06-21]"
