  \ update his exhaustive bibliography of out of print pamphlets by Dobson. \u201C\
  It's all a matter of diligent rummaging,\u201D writes Mr Jennings from the pompous\
  \ land of his banishment. Since we last heard from him, yesterday, he has managed\
  \ to track down a further title, and he is yet again to be commended for his thoroughness,\
  \ not least in assigning that pesky, but lovely, Bl\xF6tzmann Number to the pamphlet\
  \ he has unearthed. One day we might be able to work out its significance.\nPlease\
  \ note that the listed title is currently out of print.\n140. Library Clown Traumas\u2014\
