text: "Forgive me for returning to Pliny's Natural History yet again. Here (in Philomen\
  \ Holland's English translation of 1634) he is surely describing the tribe or grouplet\
  \ which spawned the Grunty Man:\n\u201CTauron writeth, That the Choromandae are\
  \ a savage and wild people: distinct voice and speech they have none, but in stead\
  \ thereof, they keep an horrible gnashing and hideous noise: rough they are and\
  \ hairy all over their bodies, eies they have red like the houlets, and toothed\
  \ they be like dogs.\u201D\nEarlier, I cannot remember where, I have said that the\
  \ Grunty Man is older than the Earth itself, but now I may have to revise that statement\
  \ in the finished version of my ten thousand page biography The Life And Times Of\
  \ The Grunty Man! (The exclamation point in the title is quite deliberate, and intended\
  \ to impart a sense of excitement to what is otherwise, I have to say, quite a dull\
  \ narrative, consisting as it does chiefly of scenes in which the Grunty Man grunts\
  \ from within his grim dark foul-smelling lair, century after century.)\n[2010-08-02]"
