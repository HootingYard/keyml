text: "Unaccountably, I missed by two years the centenary of the replacement of tin\
  \ by aluminium in the manufacture of what we still call tin foil. As so often, we\
  \ have boffins in Switzerland to thank for this innovation, namely Dr. Lauber, Neher\
  \ & Cie., who opened the world's first aluminium foil rolling plant in Emmishofen\
  \ in 1910. For those of you, and I know there are many, who like to keep track of\
  \ these things, Emmishofen is in the canton of Thurgau, or Thurgovia, in ancient\
  \ times the home of the people of the Pfyn culture, who apparently kept large numbers\
  \ of pigs.\nAs I say, I neglected to mention the centenary at the time, and I know\
  \ that many readers will have been drumming their fingers impatiently for the past\
  \ two years, wondering when I am going to get round to telling you what to do with\
  \ all that tin foil you have accumulated in your kitchen drawer. Well, I am delighted\
  \ to say that at long last I can turn my attention to this splendidly versatile\
  \ material. Just bear in mind that when I talk about tin foil I mean aluminium foil,\
  \ and I am not expecting you to try to track down a stash of the old tin stuff,\
  \ even if there is any still available, which I suspect there is not.\nThe best\
  \ thing you can do with your tin foil is to fashion for yourself a conical tin foil\
  \ hat. It is important that you make a cone shape, rather than trying to mould the\
  \ tin foil into the approximate shape of, say, a Homburg or a trilby or a stovepipe\
  \ hat. Though the wonder of tin foil is that all these hat types could quite easily\
  \ be made, you must stick to the cone. In part, this is in homage to Jimmy Goddard\
  \ and the copper cone he used for daily communication with space people. But do\
  \ not jump to the conclusion that your tin foil cone hat will help you to talk to\
  \ space people. It won't. Nor will it protect you from weird unearthly menacing\
  \ electromagnetic rays and beams and invisible hoo-hah. If such phenomena exist,\
  \ and can dislodge and jumble and even control the innards of your brain, they are\
  \ hardly likely to be dissuaded by a sheet of tin foil, are they? Nonetheless, when\
  \ forming your surplus tin foil into a hat, it is well to pay tribute to Jimmy Goddard\
  \ and the STAR Fellowship, for as Jesus said, \u201CA prophet is not without honour,\
  \ but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. And he could\
  \ there do no mighty work\u201D (Mark 6\_: 4\u20135).\nBut you can do mighty work,\
  \ wearing your conical tin foil hat. I am thinking specifically of amateur dramatics.\
  \ Some might call that leisure, rather than work, but believe you me, if you put\
  \ your heart and soul into it, amateur dramatics can feel like work, and mighty\
  \ work at that.\nThere are several parts in the repertoire where the wearing of\
  \ a conical tin foil hat is absolutely essential. Consider, for example, Old Nahamkin\
  \ in The Man Who Came To Dinner In A Shiny Pointy Hat by Belper Frisson. It is not,\
  \ admittedly, a very big part, and for most of acts two and three the character\
  \ lies apparently dead on the floor of the parlour while all hell breaks loose around\
  \ him, but just think of the applause that always greets his entrance, and that\
  \ ringing line \u201CHello, I have come to dinner, and I am wearing a shiny pointy\
  \ conical hat\u201D. It is also worth bearing in mind that Old Nahamkin gets to\
  \ keep the hat on, even after he is poisoned and stabbed and shot by the vengeful\
  \ Cassandra, he keeps it on throughout acts two and three, lying motionless on the\
  \ parlour floor, and at no time is the hat snatched by one of the other characters,\
  \ who gets to wear it instead,\nThat does of course happen in one of the other great\
  \ conical tin foil hat parts, the squalid mute in Pepinstow's An Inspector Wearing\
  \ A Shiny Pointy Hat Calls. The squalid mute, of course, turns out to be a police\
  \ inspector, a revelation somewhat less revelatory than Pepinstow intended, given\
  \ his cack-handed way of giving the game away in the play's title. But that need\
  \ not concern you. You will just need to make sure, as the curtain falls at the\
  \ end of each performance, that you retrieve your conical tin foil hat from the\
  \ actor playing Sergeant Piffle, who snatches the hat from atop the inspector's\
  \ head in that riveting scene at the end of act four, and wears it himself in a\
  \ clever ploy to foil Jasper's attempt to gain Nitty's inheritance. It might be\
  \ a creaking plot device, but whenever I have attended an amateur troupe's performance\
  \ of the play it has never failed to bring the house down.\nThere are other parts,\
  \ in some really tiptop dramas, where the wearing of your conical tin foil hat is\
  \ not actually called for in the script, but adds a certain something to the character.\
  \ You might get into arguments, or even fisticuffs, with the director, if they are\
  \ the type of director averse to the disporting of unnecessary conical tin foil\
  \ hats. If this is the case, the best thing to do is to say that you are under attack\
  \ from weird unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and beams and invisible hoo-hah\
  \ and must wear the conical tin foil hat as protection. Most theatre directors,\
  \ professional or amateur, will succumb to such a protest, particularly if it is\
  \ voiced in a wild and high-pitched screech.\nIf you loathe the very idea of amateur\
  \ dramatics, you can still find advantageous opportunities for the wearing of your\
  \ conical tin foil hat. Promenading, loitering, and hiking are all suitable activities,\
  \ particularly the latter, particularly in the rain, particularly if it is torrential.\
  \ There is nothing quite like the sound of the incessant pinging of water on metal,\
  \ as you hike in your conical tin foil hat through a teeming downpour.\n[2012-01-15]"
