text: "The relationship between a janitor and his pail is a matter well worth our\
  \ attention. Some janitors will call their pail a bucket, but it is much of a muchness.\
  \ It may well be that, for the pernickety, a pail and a bucket are not quite the\
  \ same thing, but we are not pernickety, at least not today. Today we are having\
  \ one of our non-pernickety days. Good heavens, we did not even time the boiling\
  \ of our breakfast egg to the second, as we do on our pernickety days. No, today,\
  \ we plopped the egg into the pan and set the burners roaring beneath it and we\
  \ wandered away, picked up the post from the doormat, kicked the wainscot, kicked\
  \ it again, God knows why, chucked the post into the wastepaper basket\u2014it was\
  \ all flyers, flyers\u2014put the kettle on, extracted from our majestic bouffant\
  \ a small beetle which had taken up residence, Peason-like, and placed it on the\
  \ windowsill, opened the window, adjusted the position of the vase of hollyhock\
  \ cuttings, turning them towards the light, though Lord knows there was little enough\
  \ light, so early was the hour, and pottered and puttered in other dithery ways\
  \ before returning to the kitchen to set the burners unroaring beneath the pan,\
  \ without checking the time on our wristwatch, rather judging that a sufficiency\
  \ had passed for the egg in the pan to be toothsome when shelled. On a pernickety\
  \ day, on the other hand, we would not leave our post, by the cooker, but count\
  \ the minutes and the seconds, gazing from wristwatch to pan and back again, and\
  \ as the second hand on the watch tocked to its appointed spot we would immediately\
  \ lift the pan from the roaring burners, extinguish them, hoist the egg from the\
  \ seething waters and transfer it to its egg-cup\u2014a souvenir egg-cup from an\
  \ ill-starred seaside resort\u2014sure in the knowledge that it had been boiled\
  \ for a very specific and particular length of time as recommended in Bl\xF6tzmann's\
  \ Manual of Egg-Boiling (second edition, lilac series). Thus the variation between\
  \ our pernickety and our non-pernickety days, a variation designed to crack us from\
  \ the bonds of rut.\nWhat does all that have to do with janitors and pails or, if\
  \ you prefer, janitors and buckets? Little or nothing, like the littleness of the\
  \ light as we tuck into our early morning boiled egg, like the nothingness at the\
  \ core of our all too mortal soul.\n[2014-11-11]"
