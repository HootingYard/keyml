text: 'Make sure you tune in to Resonance today, between noon and midnight, for the
  second half of the Fundraiser Weekend Marathon. Mr Key will be on air from 1.30
  to 2.00 PM announcing the auction of Derek The Dust Particle, Bring Me The Head
  Of Derek The Dust Particle!, and a complete set of Massacre, issues one to five
  of the anthologies published in the 1990s. I think bidding for items, by telephone,
  email, or metal tapping machine, continues until midnight, but all will become clear
  if you listen carefully.
