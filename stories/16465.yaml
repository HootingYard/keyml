text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Andy Martin, I recently read (or tried to read) a textbook\
  \ on recent developments in mathematics. Its pages are littered with sentences and\
  \ phrases which often sound as if they've been swiped from one of the earlier pamphlets\
  \ by that chap [Norman Davies] who wrote Further Science.\nMr Martin then lists\
  \ some of the inexplicable, yet curiously compelling, phrases he has digested, all\
  \ quoted verbatim from the text:\n\u2026degeneracy on a manifold\u2026\n\u2026lemmas\
  \ on ordinary differential operators with parameters\u2026\n\u2026sharp regularity\
  \ estimates for the solution of the oblique derivative problem\u2026\n\u2026instability\
  \ modes in Benard systems\u2026\n\u2026codimension-two bifurcations\u2026\n\u2026\
  the basic boundary value problems for operators with VMO coefficients\u2026\n\u2026\
  time dependent and time independent wave packet approaches to reactive scattering\u2026\
  \n\u2026laser excited wave packets in semiconductor heterostructures\u2026\n\u2026\
  Feshbach resonances and singular Hodge theory\u2026\n\u2026elliptic complexes of\
  \ pseudodifferential operators and to stratified media\u2026\n\u2026singular interaction\
  \ problems with distribution and hyperfunction data\u2026\n\u2026polar materials\
  \ without director symmetry\u2026\n\u2026the mechanical fragility of smectic bookshelf\
  \ structure\u2026\n\u2026quantum dot heterostructures\u2026\n\u2026eigenoscillations\
  \ in diffraction theory\u2026\n\u2026molecular integral evaluation\u2026\n\u2026\
  material tensors of ranks 2 to 7\u2026\n\u2026multiconfigurational self-consistent\
  \ fields and coupled clusters\u2026\n\u2026orientational aspects in pair transfer\
  \ and multichromophoric systems\u2026\n\u2026the Stokes parameters in nonlinear\
  \ media and self action polarisation phenomena\u2026\n\u2026canonical quantization\
  \ and stochastic wave functions\u2026\n\u2026quantum states of bosonic systems\u2026\
  \n\u2026phase space distribution functions and the density operator\u2026\nAs a\
  \ lover of books, adds Mr Martin, I assume you, too, are profoundly concerned about\
  \ the mechanical fragility of smectic bookshelf structure. Perhaps you've already\
  \ noticed it. I know I have.\n[2018-04-02]"
