text: 'The first fruits of my lobster research:

  The common English lobster, (Homarus vulgaris), as seen on the marble slab of the
  fishmonger, is very unlike his relatives beneath the waves. The curled up form in
  which he is seen when so exposed is not that usually assumed in its own element,
  unless in the act of exerting its immense powers of retrograde motion. These are
  so great that one sudden downward sweep of its curiously constructed, oar-like tail,
  is sufficient to send it like an arrow, three- or four-and-twenty feet, with the
  most extraordinary precision, thereby enabling our friend to retreat with the greatest
  rapidity into nooks, corners, and crevices among the rocks, where pursuit would
  be hopeless. His eyes being arranged on foot stalks, or stems, are free from the
  inconvenient trammels of sockets, and possess a radius of vision commanding both
  front and rear, and from their compound form (being made up of a number of square
  lenses) are extremely penetrating and powerful. The slightest shadow passing over
  the pool in which the lobster may chance to be crawling or swimming, will frequently
  cause one of these sudden backward shoots to be made, and H. vulgaris vanishes into
  some cleft or cavity with a rapidity of motion which no harlequin could ever, even
  in his wildest dreams, hope to achieve. Down among the deep channels, between the
  crags at the sea''s bottom, alarms, except from the sea robbers themselves, are
  not to dreaded.
