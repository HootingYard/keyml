text: "\nMy thanks go to OutaSpaceman for sending this photograph of a packet of what\
  \ are no doubt extremely toothsome toffee apple sausages. He asks \u201CWill they\
  \ protect me when ghouls attack?\u201D\nIndeed they will. To be more precise, they\
  \ will actually deter any attack. The last point in the government Ghoul Czar's\
  \ handy checklist referred to the preventative measure of nobbling a ghoul so it\
  \ is incapacitated from launching an attack in the first place. Toffee apple sausages\
  \ are absolutely perfect for this purpose.\nI need hardly explain why ghouls are\
  \ simultaneously attracted and repelled by this combinatory foodstuff. You do not\
  \ even need to open the packet. Simply take a saucer from your crockery cupboard\
  \ and place it on the floor, as you might do if intending to treat your cat to some\
  \ milk. Instead of pouring milk into the saucer, however, just place the packet\
  \ of toffee apple sausages on it, unopened, and go about your business, whatever\
  \ that business may be, whether it is pickling the tiny bones of a wren or rearranging\
  \ your collection of Vinder's soccer coupons in their leather-bound album.\nWhen\
  \ a ghoul comes a-shimmering and a-groaning into your homestead, it will be lured\
  \ by the toffee apple sausages, and hunker over the saucer, befuddled. One cannot\
  \ speak of its brain being discombobulated, for ghouls do not have brains as such.\
  \ Whatever that hideous insubstantial blob nestling within its ghastly head may\
  \ be, it is not a brain. But the blob will throb in the presence of toffee apple\
  \ sausages, and if the ghoul lingers long enough over the saucer, its head-blob\
  \ will either shrivel or explode, depending on what category of ghoul it is. The\
  \ one thing it will not be able to do is to summon the wherewithal to launch an\
  \ attack.\nIt will have been successfully nobbled.\nThere is much else that can\
  \ be said about the commingling of sausage and toffee apple, quite irrespective\
  \ of ghouls, but now I have to go and make a few changes to my exquisite hand-drawn\
  \ map of Blunkett-by-the-Blears.\n[2009-10-31]"
