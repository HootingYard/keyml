text: "These are dark tunnels, these Puckington Tunnels, and I have dwelt within them,\
  \ since snacking on that carton of yoghurt, for over a hundred years.\nThat innocent\
  \ little sentence, the conclusion to a piece about the Puckington Tunnels, caused\
  \ a good deal of consternation among the Hooting Yard readership, and brought to\
  \ the postbox a number of letters of complaint. This one, from Olivia Funnel, is\
  \ typical:\nDear Mr Key, she writes, I am well aware that the Hooting Yard canon\
  \ is riddled with inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and indeed with sheer ignorance,\
  \ but this time you have outdone yourself. At the end of The Puckington Tunnels\
  \ we learn that the narrator has been trapped in said tunnels for over a century.\
  \ This makes a nonsense of much of the preceding text. Even if we take at face value\
  \ the unlikely longevity of the narrator, we are left with a number of problems,\
  \ to wit:\nNone of the genres of lit referred to\u2014chick, git, and zadiesmith\u2014\
  existed one hundred years ago, so how is the narrator aware of them? How, too, does\
  \ he or she know about David Lammy's lamentable appearance on Mastermind? If the\
  \ tunnels are a magnet for tourists and part-time troglodytes, and one cannot escape\
  \ from the system once one has entered it, surely the place must be teeming with\
  \ bewildered folk? There are other stupidities in the text, but those will do to\
  \ be going on with. I think your devoted readership deserves clarification of these\
  \ matters, otherwise I will not be the only one whose life will be blighted irreparably\
  \ by flummoxment. Yours sincerely, O Funnel (Ms).\nI was not a little perplexed\
  \ by these matters myself, so I asked the narrator to address them. It was a simple\
  \ enough matter to communicate with him using the awesome power of Woohooboo. Here\
  \ is his reply:\nI am pleased your correspondent does not take issue with my remarkable\
  \ longevity, but it is still worth explaining that it is accounted for by certain\
  \ properties of the air within the tunnels. What these properties are I cannot say,\
  \ but I know I have never felt fitter in my life and that my lung capacity is that\
  \ of a fifteen-year old. I tested it myself, only yesterday, with a plastic-and-cellophane\
  \ lung analysis kit, so that is no idle boast.\nWith her queries about my knowledge\
  \ of bang up-to-the-minute popular culture, Ms Funnel makes broad assumptions without\
  \ pausing to think things through. Can she really imagine that there is a spot on\
  \ the globe, albeit a subterranean spot, that has escaped the ubiquity of zadiesmithlit?\
  \ If anything, I would say that in the Puckington Tunnels we outdo much of the world\
  \ in our devotion to the trendily headscarved faux intellectuelle writer. There\
  \ is a cult of Zadie down here, and the totems of Jeanette Winterson have been toppled\
  \ at last! And of course we receive regular consignments of chicklit and gitlit\
  \ to keep the troglodyte zombies out of mischief. I confess that it is unclear to\
  \ me how our lit is delivered. It is, I think, something to do with motors and rails\
  \ and pulleys and vacuum tubes.\nRegarding the appearance of the numbskull Lammy\
  \ on Mastermind, my knowledge of that came to me in a vision of almost Blakean intensity.\
  \ Enough said.\nI have spoken of \u201Cwe\u201D and \u201Cus\u201D and it is true\
  \ that I am not alone in the tunnels, that we have a thriving community here, kept\
  \ busy crawling on our bellies and reading lit. But there are fewer people than\
  \ one might imagine, given the number of tourists and weekenders. When he constructed\
  \ the tunnels, the \u201Chuman mole\u201D placed near the entrance a bottomless\
  \ viper pit, modelled on the one at Shoeburyness, and a majority of visitors plummet\
  \ down that, screaming. He was a proper caution, that Puckington.\nIt is to be hoped\
  \ that Olivia Funnel and the other serial whingers are satisfied with this compelling\
  \ report from our man in the tunnels. What he has to say makes complete sense to\
  \ me, and if holes remain in his narrative, then let it be a narrative with holes.\
  \ Dennis Beerpint once wrote a poem with holes in it, and it proved to be his most\
  \ popular work, far outselling his usual twee doggerel.\n[2009-01-18]"
