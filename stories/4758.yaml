text: "During the 1980s, my mother wrote a memoir of her teenage years in Belgium\
  \ during World War Two. The first version was written in longhand, and then she\
  \ bought a typewriter, typed it up, and made copies for her children. As far as\
  \ I know, she never submitted it for publication. The other day, my brother had\
  \ a bright idea. Why don't we publish it on the internet?, he suggested. Although\
  \ it is not written in diary format, I added my tuppenceworth to the effect that\
  \ it would lend itself to appearing as a blog, so\u2026 voila!, here is Ghent In\
  \ Wartime, a memoir in weekly instalments.\nI encourage you all to read it.\n\n\
