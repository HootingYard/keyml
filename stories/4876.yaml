text: "\nNige has a postage about Barbara Comyns, which served to remind me that Who\
  \ Was Changed And Who Was Dead (1954) is one of my favourite novels, and without\
  \ any doubt the finest book in the popular outbreak-of-ergot-poisoning genre. I\
  \ have not reread it for years, so have removed it from the shelves in readiness.\n\
  Those who like to delve into such things may wish to know that I consider it an\
  \ important influence on my own scribblings. How could it not be, when, leafing\
  \ through it just now I note sentences such as:\nThere was a great smell of mud,\
  \ and it was the first of June.\nWe always have cocoa after a thunderstorm.\nThe\
  \ village bachelor, drink-sodden Lumber Splinterbones, usually ambled along to Grandmother\
  \ Willoweed's birthday party.\nDennis was frightened of cows\nand there should now\
  \ be a question mark to end this sentence on a grammatically sound footing, thus\u2026\
