text: "I was interested to note that the 2013 Man Booker International Prize was awarded\
  \ to Lydia Davis. She is a writer who specialises in very, very short stories\u2014\
  so short they make Mr Key's own effusions seem like mighty epics. Could it be that\
  \ the hermetic and blinkered literary world is at last opening up to the odd and\
  \ the unfamiliar?\nI don't know Lydia Davis's work, other than a small selection\
  \ of stories which appeared in the print edition of the Guardian at the weekend.\
  \ But I am heartened by her success. It may prompt publishers to be just a tad more\
  \ adventurous and\u2014who knows?\u2014I might not be told (as I have been, more\
  \ than once) that I have \u201Cabsolutely no commercial potential whatsoever\u201D\
  .\nTo that end, and also as a way of emerging from the influenza-racked hiatus that\
  \ I know has had you lot mired in Hooting Yard-less misery for the past week or\
  \ so, I thought I might have a bash at a few shorter-than-usual stories over the\
  \ next few days. Clearly last year's thousand-words-per-day scheme, interesting\
  \ as it was (at least for me), did not quite capture the zeitgeist. All those hundreds\
  \ of essays were far too long. Cut!\n[2013-05-27]"
