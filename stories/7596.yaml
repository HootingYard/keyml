text: "Dan Chambers sent me this snap of a sampler, taken in the Bethnal Green Museum\
  \ of Childhood. The provenance card states that it was made by a girl named Enid,\
  \ aged fourteen, so, as Dan says, \u201Cmaybe not so tiny\u201D. But it may well\
  \ be that the Museum has not done its research thoroughly, and that the sampler\
  \ was made by an anonymous needleworker for Tiny Enid. What with the privations\
  \ of the times (1933) there may have been a dearth of thread, not enough, at any\
  \ rate, to sew both TINY and ENID.\n\n[2011-11-14]"
