text: "I went for a morning trudge around Nameless Pond and, having completed a circumnavigation,\
  \ I sat on a bench for a breather. I lit a cigarette and contemplated the ducks.\
  \ Foolishly, I had left my iDuck at home, so I had no idea whether I was contemplating\
  \ teal or mergansers, or indeed quite other types of duck. After some minutes, I\
  \ was joined on the bench by an ancient and withered gent whose approach I had not\
  \ been aware of. He had an air of the shabby genteel about him, and milky eyes.\n\
  \u201CGood morning,\u201D he said, without looking at me.\n\u201CHello,\u201D I\
  \ replied, hoping that would be the extent of our conversation. But no.\n\u201C\
  I see you are contemplating the ducks on the pond,\u201D he went on, \u201CAn activity\
  \ to which I myself have devoted many hours over the years. Many, many hours over\
  \ many, many years, for as you can see I am ancient and withered. I am almost as\
  \ old as Methuselah. That is not a name you come across very often nowadays, is\
  \ it?\u201D He did not pause to allow a response. \u201CIn fact I cannot think of\
  \ a single Methuselah I have ever met, and I have met an enormous number of people.\
  \ I used to be quite a gadabout before the stiffness and withering slowed me down.\
  \ I gadded hither and thither and met people from all walks of life, but never a\
  \ Methuselah. Unless of course that is your name?\u201D\n\u201CI'm afraid not,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CI am Mr Key.\u201D\n\u201CI am very pleased to meet you, Mr Key.\
  \ I am Mr Creeke, C. C. Creeke. The funny thing is, my parents never divulged what\
  \ the Cs stand for, and my birth certificate was rendered illegible in one of those\
  \ overturned bleach bottle mishaps one occasionally reads about in the popular press.\
  \ My father was a musician and my mother was a Marxist-Leninist, so I have long\
  \ suspected that I was named after Cornelius Cardew, the composer of 10,000 Nails\
  \ In The Coffin Of Imperialism, among other works, or possibly after Chris Cutler,\
  \ the drummer and percussionist in Henry Cow and roughly six hundred and forty-five\
  \ other bands and combos and one-off projects. Given my ancientness either may be\
  \ chronologically dubious, as parental choices, but the world is a very mysterious\
  \ place, Mr Key, as I am sure you have noticed.\u201D\nAgain he continued to babble\
  \ on without awaiting any kind of reply.\n\u201CIn a world of such mystery and bafflement\
  \ it is well to have at least one fixed point of clarity and order. I found it at\
  \ Pang Hill Orphanage, where for many years I was retained as the Inspector of Nuisances.\
  \ I see you are raising your eyebrows.\u201D\nI was not, and in any case he was\
  \ still not looking at me.\n\u201CIt surprises you to learn that any of the orphans\
  \ at Pang Hill could ever have been deemed nuisances. When would they ever have\
  \ had the time to be mischievous and pesky and scampish?, you wonder. Confined at\
  \ night to their iron cots, and in the daytime huddled in the cellar labouring away\
  \ by the dim light of a single Toc H lamp, betweentimes scoffing their gruel and\
  \ having compulsory singsongs and prostrating themselves before strange voodoo idols\
  \ and all the other activities of the orphanage day, they would surely have been\
  \ too exhausted to be nuisances. So you think. But believe me, Mr Key, when I made\
  \ my weekly visits, clanging my bell, there would be a parade of nuisances whom\
  \ it was my duty to inspect. And inspect them I did, with magnifying lenses and\
  \ calipers and measuring tape, and then I wrote my report for the beadle. What became\
  \ of my reports I never knew, and never asked. I had other things on my plate.\n\
  \u201CFor Pang Hill Orphanage and its nuisances demanded my attention on only one\
  \ day of the week. The rest of the time I was engaged on the first ever survey of\
  \ Pointy Town. I surveyed as many of the pointy bits as a man could reasonably be\
  \ expected to survey in one working lifetime. But whereas Pang Hill was a fixed\
  \ point of clarity and order, Pointy Town was quite the opposite. Indeed, surveying\
  \ all those pointy bits drove me crackers. There was no end to them, nor any sense\
  \ to them, and it wore me down, slowly but surely. That is why I am now so withered.\
  \ Oh, look! A pochard!\u201D\nAnd indeed, a pochard had come dabbling close to the\
  \ bank of the pond, so close I could have leaned forward and grabbed it and wrung\
  \ its neck, had I been so minded. But I have put my duck-strangling days behind\
  \ me. It was always a foolish and unpleasant hobby.\nWhile my attention was on the\
  \ pochard, C. C. Creeke vanished. I cannot put it more plainly than that. Just as\
  \ he had appeared on the bench without my noticing his advent, so he left it. I\
  \ looked around, wildly, but there was no trace of him. I was baffled, but the world\
  \ is indeed a very mysterious place.\nIt was time to go home. I got up and trudged\
  \ on my way, and then I spotted, half hidden in the sordid undergrowth beside the\
  \ pond, a plinth. Brushing the nettles aside, I read:\n\nThe foliage was too thickly\
  \ entangled for me to discover what was atop the plinth. And when I returned, the\
  \ next day, armed with a pair of secateurs, I was unable to find it again. I searched\
  \ and searched, but eventually I gave up, and sat on the bench, and smoked, and\
  \ contemplated the ducks.\n[Thanks to Outa_Spaceman for the snap,]\n[2012-08-24]"
