  \ trying to survey very complex\u2026 things\u201D. He paused beautifully at the\
  \ point where I have inserted that ellipsis. Leaving aside the intriguing notion\
  \ of baskets carrying out surveys, this seems to be a statement of brilliant profundity.\
  \ I have been thinking about it for a couple of hours now and have yet to winkle\
  \ from it the core of its wisdom.\n[2008-05-14]"
