text: "I do not use the word \u201Cnaff\u201D, because I think the word \u201Cnaff\u201D\
  \ is in itself naff. When I wish to describe something as naff, I employ a less\
  \ naff euphemism, with which those who know me are familiar. By the same token,\
  \ I object to the phrase \u201Cdumbing down\u201D, which in itself seems to me an\
  \ instance of dumbing down. \u201CInfantilisation\u201D is a possible substitute,\
  \ though it does not quite capture the full meaning of \u201Cdumbing down\u201D\
  .\nThe process, whatever we choose to call it, is all around us, of course. The\
  \ latest incidence occurred when I opened my gas bill. Instead of hoicking from\
  \ the envelope a bald bureaucratic statement, I was horrified to find myself looking\
  \ at what I mistook for a teaching aid from an infant school self esteem \u2018\
  n\u2019 diversity awareness hub. It was all blocks of glaring primary colours and\
  \ word balloons, complete with a sinister little photo-cartoon of a homunculus,\
  \ the head out of proportion to the body. I begin to wonder if British Gas will\
  \ accept payment in play money.\nOn an entirely different matter, I noted on a side\
  \ panel on the front page of yesterday's Grauniad the line: Lionel Shriver\_: Who\
  \ cares about what I eat?, to which my immediate response, spoken aloud as I chucked\
  \ the paper across the room in exasperation, was Nobody cares, Lionel Shriver, nobody\
  \ cares at all!\n[2013-05-12]"
