  \ phone down\n  And sheds a bitter tear\n  She's a little old woman who lives in\
  \ a shoe\n  And she's feeling kind of blue.\nCab Calloway calls a cab for her\n\
  \  And drives her to the future\n  Now she's no longer Mavis\n  Instead she's Minnie\
  \ the Moocher\nShe mooches and she smooches\n  Does fandangos in the aisles\n  Goodbye\
  \ to that confounded shoe\n  {And thank the Lord!)\n  \u2018She didn't take that\
  \ call from Miles\n[2014-08-17]"
