text: "\u201CAh! what a beautiful idea occurs to me at this point! Once, on the hustings\
  \ at Liverpool, I saw a mob orator, whose brawling mouth, open to its widest expansion,\
  \ suddenly some larking sailor, by the most dexterous of shots, plugged up with\
  \ a paving-stone. Here, now, at Valladolid was another mouth that equally required\
  \ plugging. What a pity, then, that some gay brother page of Kate's had not been\
  \ there to turn aside into the room, armed with a roasted potato, and, taking a\
  \ sportsman's aim, to have lodged it in the crocodile's abominable mouth! Yet, what\
  \ an anachronism! There were no roasted potatoes in Spain at that date (1608), which\
  \ can be apodeictically proved, because in Spain there were no potatoes at all,\
  \ and very few in England. But anger drives a man to say anything.\u201D\nThomas\
  \ De Quincey, The Spanish Military Nun (1854)\n[2010-12-27]"
