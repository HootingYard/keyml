text: "\nLast night I dreamt I went to the Nocturnal Pig Observatory again. But it\
  \ was one of those dreams where everything happens in bright and battering sunlight.\
  \ This made it particularly disturbing, because, with the exception of the unfamiliar\
  \ light, everything else in the dream matched my memories of those times. I sat\
  \ at the console, twiddling the knobs. I made adjustments to the pig scanner with\
  \ a pair of pliers. I gazed out through the pig-proof plexiglass observation panel,\
  \ while making indentations in my tally-stick.\nOne other detail that jarred was\
  \ the presence, within the Observatory, of an albino chicken. I think it may have\
  \ been a Vanbrugh chicken. It was so white, and the sunlight so glaring, that the\
  \ chicken seemed to shimmer, like one imagines an Angel of the Lord come to earth\
  \ upon a visitation.\nI saw no pigs, so in that sense again the dream had an air\
  \ of brute reality. Not once, in all my years of duty at the Nocturnal Pig Observatory,\
  \ did I ever spot a real pig. Sham ones, yes, of course, and puppet pigs, and ghosts\
  \ of pigs. But never a real, solid, porker. The flat wild bleak desolate windswept\
  \ tarputa is inimical to pigs, thank heaven, but we must always be on the watch.\
  \ Or at least we used to be, back in those days, when we were pig ignorant.\nNow\
  \ things have changed, many say for the better. Much of the tarputa is no longer\
  \ as flat and wild and bleak and desolate and windswept as once it was. There are\
  \ ice cream kiosks and miniature zoos and an aerodrome. There is a huge cement statue,\
  \ on a plinth, of star of stage and screen Googie Withers (1917\u20142011). There\
  \ is even, mischievously, an extensive modern state-of-the-art pig sty, though it\
  \ is of course empty of pigs, including sham and puppet and ghost pigs.\nOr is it?\
  \ One would have to creep up to the edge of the pig sty in darkness, on a moonless\
  \ night, and train one's portable pig scanner upon the most likely ghost-haunted\
  \ parts of the sty, and wait, in silence and awe, for a sighting, to be duly recorded\
  \ in one's ghost pig log, with a notch indented on one's tally-stick. Who among\
  \ us can say we are truly prepared for such a task?\nSince I awoke, I have been\
  \ thinking, like a man obsessed, about that shimmering albino chicken. What did\
  \ its dream-presence portend? I can wring no sense from it, as I prance like a ninny\
  \ across the tarputa, on my way to buy a choc-ice from the kiosk, and to lay a bouquet\
  \ of gladioli upon the cement feet of Googie Withers. That will make my Thursday\
  \ complete. And when I settle down to sleep, will I dream of the Nocturnal Pig Observatory\
  \ again? Will the past haunt me still? Do I dare to eat a peach? Is there honey\
  \ still for tea? Where have all the flowers gone? What's so funny 'bout pigs, love,\
  \ and understanding?\n[2017-09-16]"
