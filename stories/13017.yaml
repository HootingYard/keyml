text: "Diligent readers who commit to memory everything that I have ever written (that\
  \ is, most of you) will recall that somewhere or other I bemoaned the fact that\
  \ my brainpans are assailed by a persistent earworm. It is my fate to suffer, rattling\
  \ around inside my bonce, day in day out, the strains of Merry Xmas (War Is Over)\
  \ by Mr Lennon and Ms Ono, augmented by a choir of tinies. Why this is so, I cannot\
  \ say. All I can assume is that I must have done something awful in a previous life\
  \ and the gods have seen fit to torment me in a particularly cruel way.\nNow, perhaps,\
  \ there is a gleam of hope. For the past week or so, the Yuletide caterwaulings\
  \ of the Beatle and the woman Cornelius Cardew threw out of his house have been\
  \ replaced. But my new earworm is, it has to be said, somewhat challenging. I am\
  \ now beset by Henry Cow's Living In The Heart Of The Beast, which takes over a\
  \ quarter of an hour to work its way through my poor cranium. This is indubitably\
  \ more welcome, but I do ask myself why I can't have a snappy snippet of pop music,\
  \ which is what an earworm ought to be.\nIncidentally, for those of you who care\
  \ about such things, Living In The Heart Of The Beast was written (by Tim Hodgkinson)\
  \ during the period of collaboration between Henry Cow and Slapp Happy. The music\
  \ was given to Peter Blegvad, who was instructed to supply lyrics. He came up with\
  \ something about chickens. \u201CThis won't do at all.\u201D pronounced Hodgkinson,\
  \ who proceeded to write his own words, of a more Marxist-Leninist bent. Shortly\
  \ afterwards, Blegvad was dismissed from the merged group for \u201Cflippancy\u201D\
