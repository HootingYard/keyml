text: "John Tilbury, in his biography Cornelius Cardew\_: \_A Life Unfinished (2008)\
  \ on some of the later songs, when our hero had become a member of the Central Committee\
  \ of the Revolutionary Communist Party Of Britain (Marxist-Leninist):\nInvariably,\
  \ the songs are extended by virtue of repetition ; in \u201CRevisionist Somersaults\
  \ And The Opportunist Opposition\u201D the brevity and uneventfulness of the melody\
  \ is a blessing, except that there are ten verses; the crude lyric is provided with\
  \ music which is appropriately routine\u2026 How can this be explained\u2014by which\
  \ I mean, what was Cardew thinking at the time? I quote just the first verse:\n\
  One jumps out and one jumps in saying\nCPC(ML) agent of the bourgeoisie\nThe Moscow\
  \ \u2018communists\u2019 really love this country\nAnd say that CPC(ML) is against\
  \ democracy\nWith one foot in and the other also\nThe revisionists and opportunists\
  \ defend the status quo\n\u201CAn Opportunist Has Come Back Home\u201D is an endless,\
  \ turgid, sectarian tract attacking a \u2018revisionist\u2019 who has betrayed the\
  \ Party. The text is spoken and sung; the music is interspersed with, and accompanies,\
  \ speech alternating with a sung chorus\u2026 the whole text [is] of extraordinary\
  \ length, doubtless uncut and unabridged. Here, towards the beginning, Voice 1 describes\
  \ the young man:\nOh beautiful sight! What a striking pose!\nOh look at his Russian\
  \ greatcoat,\nThe Mao badge on his lapel,\nHis Castroite fatigues,\nAnd this is\
  \ not all! Oh yes!\n(Voice II)\nAn opportunist has come back home\nFor me, the wonderful\
  \ thing about these songs is that they are sung in an impeccably upper middle class\
  \ accent, and have a jauntiness redolent of the Bloomsbury set on a picnic outing.\
  \ Not so much jolly hockey sticks as jolly petrol bombs. (I'm also intrigued by\
  \ the way the ideological imperative of the lyrics means that they rarely scan comfortably.\
  \ Well, you try packing\_\u201Cour ideology is Marxism-Leninism, we're workers and\
  \ like workers everywhere our aspiration is for socialism ushered in by violent\
  \ revolution\u201D or \u201Cin utter chaos the old order spews out unlimited decadence\
  \ and parasitism\u201D into a singable song.)\n[2011-07-14]"
