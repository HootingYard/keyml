text: "Several readers have written in to ask if any parallels can be drawn between\
  \ Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely Zoo and Noah's Ark. The answer is: very few, the most\
  \ noteworthy of which is that Grandma Pipstraw had three sons named Ham, Shem, and\
  \ Japheth.\nFans of nineteen-sixties folk-pop may recall them as The Singing Pipstraws.\
  \ Think of The Seekers minus Judith Durham. Indeed, The Singing Pipstraws were sometimes\
  \ mistaken for the Australasian foursome (minus Judith Durham), chiefly because\
  \ Shem Pipstraw bore a striking resemblance to Seeker Athol Guy. He even obtained\
  \ his trademark spectacles from the same optician, despite living on the other side\
  \ of the world from that most wistful of eye specialists.\nInterestingly, the optician's\
  \ given name was Noah, and he lived on a boat moored in an important Australian\
  \ river the name of which escapes me. I wanted to write the Maitland, but I think\
  \ that is in Canada. There are so many rivers, not only in Australasia and North\
  \ America but also on the other continents, and I can hardly be expected to remember\
  \ them all, and to know at the drop of a hat which ones are on which continents.\
  \ I have never proclaimed myself a river expert\u2014unlike Ham Pipstraw, who, when\
  \ he was not strumming a stringed instrument and warbling, liked nothing better\
  \ than to pore over atlases and gazetteers, memorising all the rivers of the world,\
  \ their names and lengths and locations and directions of flow. By the time of his\
  \ tragically early death, Ham Pipstraw had committed to memory the details of at\
  \ least six rivers worldwide.\nSeveral readers have written in, in the last few\
  \ seconds, to ask for details of the tragically early death of sixties folk-pop\
  \ legend Ham Pipstraw. It happened like this. He was visiting the zoo and aviary\
  \ run by his mother, known as Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely Zoo, when he was engulfed\
  \ in a flock of whinchats. The frantic beating of their tiny wings did for Ham Pipstraw.\n\
  He was memorialised in a song by his surviving brothers, which topped the hit parade\
  \ until it was dislodged by a disc more in keeping with the freaky psychedelic groove\
  \ which fuddled the heads of the so-called new generation. All generations are new\u2014\
  that is the point of them.\nShem and Japheth invited Noah to replace Ham, so they\
  \ could be a trio again, but the wistful Australian optician declined, citing a\
  \ devotion to the correction of eyesight, a tin ear, and the trauma he had experienced\
  \ when his own beat combo recorded their difficult second album.\nOther parallels\
  \ between Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely Zoo and Noah's Ark are the subject of a forthcoming\
  \ stage musical starring a hologram of the late Dusty Springfield.\n[2018-03-04]"
