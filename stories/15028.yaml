  \ Out Of Print Pamphleteers. We are hoping to raise about 47 New Pence, but more\u2014\
  indeed, considerably more\u2014would aid the Relief Committee in their important\
  \ work of keeping that confounded wolf away from Mr Key's door.\nIf you have been\
  \ entertained, diverted, instructed, or otherwise had the cockles of your heart\
  \ warmed by Hooting Yard this year, or over the past god knows how many years, please\
  \ give generously. The \u201CDonate\u201D or \u201CSubscribe\u201D bits over to\
  \ your right, beneath all the books, will lead you to Paypal. Feel free to empty\
  \ your bank account should you feel strangely compelled to do so.\nAll donations\
  \ will be received with genuine gratitude.\n[2016-12-18]"
