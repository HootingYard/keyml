text: 'It is traditional at Hooting Yard, as Christmas approaches, to wheel out Little
  Severin, the Mystic Badger, and to pay close attention to his prognostications.
  The only difficulty lies in interpreting them, for Little Severin''s spooky forecasts
  take the form of his scrubbling about with his mighty claws among twigs and roots
  and undergrowth to no apparent purpose. So while we try to work out what on earth
  it may all portend, here is a snap of the Mystic Badger to print and cut out and
  paste with glue to your Hooting Yard Advent Calendar.
