text: "[Originally posted on Friday 24 July]\nThe bread I eat in London, is a deleterious\
  \ paste, mixed up with chalk, alum, and bone-ashes ; insipid to the taste, and destructive\
  \ to the constitution\u2026\nThe milk\u2026 should not pass unanalysed, the produce\
  \ of faded cabbage-leaves and sour draff, lowered with hot water, frothed with bruised\
  \ snails, carried through the streets in open pails, exposed to foul rinsings discharged\
  \ from doors and windows, spittle, snot, and tobacco-quids from foot-passengers,\
  \ over-flowings from mud-carts, spatterings from coach-wheels, dirt and trash chucked\
  \ into it by roguish boys for the joke's sake, the spewings of infants, who have\
  \ slabbered in the tin-measure, which is thrown back in that condition among the\
  \ milk, for the benefit of the next customer ; and finally, the vermin that drops\
  \ from the rags of the nasty drab that vends this precious mixture, under the respectable\
  \ denomination of milkmaid.\nI shall conclude this catalogue of London dainties,\
  \ with that table-beer, guiltless of hops and malt, vapid and nauseous ; much fitter\
  \ to facilitate the operation of a vomit, than to quench thirst and promote digestion\
  \ ; the tallowy rancid mass called butter, manufactured with candle-grease and kitchen\
  \ stuff ; and their fresh eggs, imported from France and Scotland.\nFrom\_The Expedition\
  \ Of Humphry Clinker by Tobias Smollett (1771)\n[2009-07-25]"
