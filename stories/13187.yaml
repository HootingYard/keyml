text: "The other day I met a man who has devoted the past several years to a singular\
  \ literary project. His aim is to produce a bowdlerised version of the complete\
  \ works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which all reference to the spine-tingling and the\
  \ spooky, the eldritch and the uncanny, is expunged. I was able immediately to grasp\
  \ the value of this scheme. Lovecraft is a fascinating writer, but there must be\
  \ many potential readers who are deterred from his work because, quite frankly,\
  \ they do not wish to get the collywobbles. Excise the spine-tingling and the spooky,\
  \ the eldritch and the uncanny, and an entire new constituency of fans will be created.\n\
  I asked my new friend how he went about the creation of an expurgated Lovecraft.\
  \ He explained that he began by simply deleting all the terrifying adjectives, adverbs,\
  \ verbs and nouns. This had the unintended consequence of rendering much of Lovecraft's\
  \ prose \u201Cbitty and near-incomprehensible\u201D, as he put it. Whole passages\
  \ were reduced to strings of prepositions. Though commendably brief, the resulting\
  \ text lacked heft. So then, he said proudly, his real work began. He realised that\
  \ he could reinstate a certain amount of readability, and up the word-count, by\
  \ replacing, for example, Shoggoth with a pretty vase of flowers, or hideous tentacles\
  \ with gambolling bunny rabbits. I pointed out to him that some people\u2014not\
  \ least myself\u2014found rabbits utterly frightening, and he promised to look again\
  \ at his revisions.\nThen he bid me farewell, and I sat alone at the caf\xE9 table,\
  \ mercilessly correlating all the contents of my mind.\n[2014-09-09]"
