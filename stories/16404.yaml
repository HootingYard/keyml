text: "Oh! How I pine for those winklepicker days\n  On the pier at Deal\n  Like Ingmar\
  \ Bergman's camera's gaze\n  In The Seventh Seal\n  Yes, I played chess on Deal\
  \ pier\n  Against Death dressed in black\n  But I was shod in winklepickers\n  And\
  \ they took Death aback\n  I saw envy on his pale white face\n  Envy for my shoon\n\
  \  And I bested Death on the pier at Deal\n  Under a Kentish moon\n[2018-03-26]"
