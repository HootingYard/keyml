text: "Yesterday, I put all my eggs in one basket and counted my chickens before they'd\
  \ hatched. These deeds put me in bad odour with the Eggs And Chickens Man who, when\
  \ he came on his rounds in the afternoon, reprimanded me. He told me in no uncertain\
  \ terms that I was foolhardy.\n\u201CI am sorry, tovarich,\u201D I said, for I lived\
  \ in the Soviet Union, at least within my head, \u201CI felt strangely compelled\
  \ to do both those things. I don't know what came over me.\u201D\nHe looked at me\
  \ closely, the expression on his face an admixture of reproach, contempt, pity,\
  \ disgust, superiority, compassion, bewilderment, nausea, menace, loathing, awe,\
  \ rancour, spleen, pomposity, sympathy, empathy, and psychopathology. I did not\
  \ like the way he was absent-mindedly swinging to and fro a huge gleaming razor-sharp\
  \ butcher's cleaver.\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D he said eventually, \u201CYou are a fool.\
  \ Like those holy fools with whom your beloved Mother Russia used to swarm.\u201D\
  \n\u201COh no,\u201D I said, \u201CYou've got the wrong Russia. I think you'll find\
  \ that holy fools were rife in the vast Russian countryside under the Tsar. My own\
  \ preference is for the Soviet Union, from which such fools were eradicated.\u201D\
  \n\u201CBe that as it may,\u201D said the Eggs And Chickens Man, \u201CThis is neither\
  \ Tsarist Russia nor the Soviet Union, and your behaviour was that of a fool, foolish\
  \ and foolhardy.\u201D\nI hate to be reminded that I do not actually live in the\
  \ Soviet Union. I could feel hot tears welling up.\n\u201CWhy don't you pop inside?\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CThere's a piping hot samovar full of black tea, far too much for\
  \ me to drink all by myself.\u201D\nHe gave the cleaver another, more measured,\
  \ swing, and I felt a sickening spasm in the bowels.\n\u201CI think not,\u201D he\
  \ said, \u201CI have my rounds to do. I'll be back tomorrow, and by then I'll want\
  \ to see that you've redistributed the eggs into several baskets and uncounted the\
  \ chickens.\u201D\n\u201CUncounted?\u201D I said, \u201CHow am I to uncount them,\
  \ tovarich?\u201D\n\u201CStop calling me tovarich,\u201D he said, \u201CYou are\
  \ perfectly able to button the buttons on your cheap serge jacket, and then to unbutton\
  \ them. The principle is the same.\u201D\nAs he walked off along the lane, jauntily\
  \ swinging the butcher's cleaver, it occurred to me that I could use what had just\
  \ happened as material for my work in progress, a novel written strictly according\
  \ to the precepts of socialist realism. I went indoors, poured a cup of black tea\
  \ from the samovar, and sat down at my escritoire.\nThree hours later, I was still\
  \ sat there, staring into space, my pen untouched, the paper blank, the black tea\
  \ stone cold.\n[2014-01-24]"
