  \ of your favourite television show of all time, The Frank Key And Lepke B. Half-Hour\
  \ will be broadcast live, yes live!, on ResoVision tomorrow (Saturday) at 2.30 PM\
  \ UK time. Turn on, tune in, shovel snack foods down your gullet, furrow your brow,\
  \ and concentrate. That is all I ask of you. God knows it is little enough, at least\
  \ for the time being, pending inquiries, debriefings, further snacking opportunities,\
  \ and hell freezing over.\n[2010-10-15]"
