text: "I received an invitation to attend a swish sophisticated cocktail party, and\
  \ decided to wear for the occasion my second-best bib and tucker.\nOn the evening\
  \ itself, with the party in full swing, I was leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece\
  \ when I was approached by a fellow guest.\n\u201CYou are a grown man,\u201D she\
  \ said, \u201CWhy are you wearing a bib?\u201D\nI embarked upon a lengthy explanation\
  \ of the phenomenon known as involuntary slobbering, citing certain vivid examples\
  \ both from my own experience and from the historical records. I prattled for quite\
  \ some time, holding my interlocutor spellbound, until one of my exemplary slobbering\
  \ vignettes caused her to interrupt me.\n\u201CSpiro Agnew?\u201D she cried, so\
  \ loudly that she caught the attention of guests on the far side of the room.\n\u201C\
  Indeed so,\u201D I said, \u201CAnd I will not qualify my assertion with that weasel-word\_\
  allegedly.\u201D\nAt this, she executed a startled little jump, and confessed to\
  \ a terrible fear of weasels. I told her they only alarmed me when they went pop!\
  \ up and down the City Road. More than once, I added, such weasel-popping had caused\
  \ me to slobber involuntarily. I was pleased, momentarily, to have brought the conversation\
  \ back to my chosen topic, but my new companion was now fixated upon weasels, and\
  \ insisted I join her in a search-and-destroy mission in case any weasels had infiltrated\
  \ the cocktail party.\n\u201CWith what,\u201D I asked, \u201CShall we destroy any\
  \ weasels we might hunt down?\u201D\n\u201CWell,\u201D she said, \u201CWhat is that?\u201D\
  \ and she pointed to my tucker.\n\u201CThat is my second-best tucker,\u201D I said,\
  \ \u201CIt goes with the bib.\u201D\n\u201CWe can use it to smother any weasels\
  \ we find!\u201D she cried, and she took me by the hand, and led me away from the\
  \ drawing room towards another part of the house where, she hinted, there might\
  \ be weasels.\nI never did get the chance to finish my exemplary slobbering vignette\
  \ featuring the thirty-ninth vice president of the United States of America. But\
  \ the weasel-frightened lady gave me her telephone number, so one evening soon I\
  \ will call her, and tell her the rest of that tale, and several others, until the\
  \ cows come home.\n[2017-03-18]"
