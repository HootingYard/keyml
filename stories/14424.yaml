  Into A Tin Bowl.

  The ceilings of Maison Crimplene are painted blue, with scattered spots of brilliant
  gold, to resemble a mediaeval painted sky. The floors are uniformly filthy. They
  have never seen a mop.

  On one wall of the tea ceremony parlour in Maison Crimplene hangs a hyperrealist
  portrait of John Prescott, painted by the noted hyperrealist Rex Hyper. On the opposite
  wall hangs a similar painting of Prescott''s wife Pauline. They are gazing at each
  other, forever.

  The major domo of Maison Crimplene is Pottymouth Peabrain of Plovdiv. Each time
  he opens his mouth it pours forth a tirade of disgusting abuse. But he speaks in
  Bulgarian, which few visitors to Maison Crimplene understand.

  The bomb that tore through the cellars of Maison Crimplene but somehow left the
  building standing was planted by a gormless idiot boy from the nearest village,
  across the lake. He drowned in the lake shortly afterwards, when he toppled from
  his dinghy, surprised by a tern.

  A black and white photograph of Maison Crimplene, taken at long distance from a
  mountain peak, appears on the cover of the September 1956 issue of Maisons Snapped
  From Mountains magazine. Its editrix at the time was noted hyperrealist painter
  Rex Hyper''s sister, Dot Photog.

  The extensive gardens of Maison Crimplene are littered with discarded bubblegum
  wrappers. Brutes with tails disport themselves in the trees and bushes, grunting
  in the daylight hours and howling in the night.

  In one room of Maison Crimplene, off the main passageway and down a short flight
  of slippery steps, are stacked hundreds and hundreds of gunny sacks crammed with
  gutta-percha. Ticks creep up and down the walls of this room.

  During the Second World War, troops from several combatant nations were billeted
  in Maison Crimplene, sometimes at the same time. Fighting,, brawling, and stabbings
  were averted through an unspoken code of bonhomie, exquisite manners, and pipe-smoking.

  Oh! the chandeliers in Maison Crimplene, the chandeliers!

  The most expensive room at Maison Crimplene is the one where Perry Como once stayed,
  accompanied by a pair of puppets made by the noted Swiss puppeteer Rolf Swisspupp.
  Como''s bill was settled by the priest from the nearest village, across the lake,
  in which the gormless idiot boy drowned when he toppled from his dinghy, surprised
  by a tern.
