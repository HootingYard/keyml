text: "When the panel met for the final time, to sign off on their deliberations of\
  \ the previous six sessions, it was brought to their attention that they had completely\
  \ forgotten to name one of the fruits.\n\u201CI have here a punnet of this fruit,\u201D\
  \ said the second secretary, \u201CIt has somehow escaped the panel's attention\
  \ heretofore.\u201D\nThere was a hubbub of consternation, which is a very different\
  \ thing to other hubbubs, such as the hubbub of outrage or the hubbub of rapidly-donned\
  \ camouflage jackets. Hubbubs of all kidneys, however, diminish eventually, and\
  \ when this one did, one among the panel who happened to be wearing an unnecessary\
  \ camouflage jacket, said:\n\u201CLet us take a close look at that punnet.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWould it not be better to look closely at the unnamed fruit contained in\
  \ the punnet, rather than at the punnet itself?\u201D\nThese words were spoken by\
  \ a panel member who had been conspicuously silent ever since the first session,\
  \ when he had pulled out of the bag, metaphorically, the word \u201Cclementine\u201D\
  , to denote the clementine, one of which he then pulled out of a paper bag, literally.\n\
  Sage heads nodding in agreement, the panel members gave their undivided attention\
  \ to the items of fruit in the punnet. After some while, one asked his fellows:\n\
  \u201CHave we already made use of the word \u2018grape\u2019?\u201D\n\u201CWe have.\
  \ But you are clearly thinking this fruit requires a one-syllable name.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Indeed.\u201D\n\u201COn what grounds?\u201D\n\u201COh, just look at it! Look at\
  \ them! In their punnet! I am sorry to sound so exasperated, but only a dolt or\
  \ a halfwit would dub that fruit with a multisyllabic name. It cries out for something\
  \ simple, and short, and blunt.\u201D\nThe passion of this outburst convinced the\
  \ other panel members of its general truth. Passion need not always denote truth,\
  \ of course. More often it can lead to all sorts of human error, particularly when\
  \ it crosses the line into hysteria. Consider the example of massed Corbynistas\
  \ with their placrads.\n\u201CIt is a shame,\u201D said Arpad, the senior member\
  \ of the panel, \u201CThat we have already registered \u2018passion fruit\u2019\
  \ as a fruit name.\u201D\n\u201COn that point,\u201D said his immediate table-neighbour,\
  \ \u201CCan anybody explain why, in some cases, we have used the word \u2018fruit\u2019\
  \ as part of the fruit name? I am thinking of the passion fruit and the kiwi fruit,\
  \ which you will recall we named at Thursday's session. Why are we labouring the\
  \ word \u2018fruit\u2019 when it is blindingly obvious that the thing denoted is\
  \ a fruit?\u201D\nBefore anybody could answer this reasonable query, there was an\
  \ interruption from the radio transmitter. The lovely strains of Xavier Cugat And\
  \ His Orchestra gave way to a gravely-voiced newsflash. There had been a bittern\
  \ storm over Ulm. Cugat resumed.\n\u201CHow about ulm?\u201D piped up Binns, \u201C\
  A punnet of ulms?\u201D\n\u201CIt is tempting,\u201D said Arpad, \u201CBut I have\
  \ two objections. First, the fruit may thereby become too closely associated with\
  \ the city in Baden-W\xFCrttemberg where this bittern storm has just occurred. Second,\
  \ I think we are all agreed that most fruit-names benefit from beginning with consonants.\
  \ Not all, but most.\u201D\nThe panel then worked through the alphabet, appending\
  \ consonants to \u201Culm\u201D. After a vote, they agreed unanimously on \u201C\
  pulm\u201D. When the second secretary came to write the new fruit-name in the register,\
  \ he was momentarily distracted by the cry of a bittern, booming from the marshes\
  \ anent the manse, and he accidentally transposed the middle letters of the word.\n\
  And hence the plum.\n[2018-05-02]"
