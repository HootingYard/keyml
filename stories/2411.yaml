text: "Mr Key would like to draw to your attention a small exhibition at the National\
  \ Portrait Gallery. Fabiola is a collection of mostly \u201Camateur\u201D portraits\
  \ of Saint Fabiola, collected over the years by the Flemish artist Francis Al\xC3\
  \xBFs. They are all based on a single source, a now lost 19th century painting,\
  \ which means they look almost identical\u2014but they're not, of course. The effect\
  \ of seeing them all gathered together in a couple of rooms is quite mesmerising.\
  \ The official gallery page is here, and there is a photograph of an earlier showing\
  \ in New York here.\_\n\n[2009-05-04]"
