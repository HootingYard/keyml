text: "Clint Eastwood's new film American Snipe has broken box-office records in its\
  \ first week on release. It is quite an achievement for the octogenarian director,\
  \ the more so, perhaps, given its ornithological theme. American Snipe tells the\
  \ true story of a snipe with a record number of kills. The film follows the bird\
  \ as it flies around, swooping down to catch and gobble up crane flies, horse flies,\
  \ deer flies, beetles, dragonflies, crickets, grasshoppers, ants, mayflies, butterflies,\
  \ caddis flies and moths. No explicit moral judgements are made, though at one point\
  \ an ornithologist, observing the slaughter, remarks \u201CThey're just insects\u201D\
  .\nThe film has provoked controversy in the United States, winning plaudits from\
  \ right-wingers while those on the liberal left have condemned it for painting a\
  \ picture of unalloyed avian savagery, instead of showing nature as twee and cuddly.\n\
  The role of the American snipe is played by an award-winning snipe with a particularly\
  \ long slender pointy bill.\n\n[2015-02-01]"
