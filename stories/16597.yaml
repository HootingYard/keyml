text: "The sun is a ball of flames. It feels like a torrid southern summer \u2026\
  \ I can see a port. People are strolling in the shade of the high harbour walls.\
  \ Shop doors are open wide. Aromas of tropical fruit fill the air with their fragrance.\
  \ Peaches, oranges, apricots, raisins, cloves, and pepper all give off their wonderful\
  \ scents. The asphalt steams after being sprayed with water. I can hear the strident,\
  \ guttural tones of Persian merchants offering their wares. My God! How marvellous\
  \ it smells here! How pleasant is the tropical air!\nSuddenly my foot tripped over\
  \ my ski pole. I quickly steadied myself against the kayak, opened my eyes wide,\
  \ and was dazzled by the sun. For a moment I did not know where I was. What had\
  \ happened to my tropical port? How the devil had I been transported to this icy\
  \ wasteland?\n\u201CWhat happened?\u201D asked my companions. \u201CNothing,\u201D\
  \ I answered, \u201CI tripped over my pole. The boreal landscape unfolded once more\
  \ before me in an infinite expanse, and the sun which had fleetingly brought me\
  \ such joy now sought only to blind and torture me.\nYet the hallucination did not\
  \ completely vanish. My nose was still filled with the aromas of Mediterranean fruit.\
  \ My companions were not conscious of my present condition. What did it mean? Was\
  \ I ill? I shut my eyes tight once again. I was like an automaton, moving rhythmically\
  \ with the pole in my right hand, and once again I could hear the monotonous tune:\
  \ \u201CFar to go, so very far!\u201D\nBut what I had just experienced continued\
  \ to trouble me. For strangely enough I had never liked those aromatic fruits. They\
  \ had never tempted my palate.\nValerian Albanov, In The Land Of White Death\_:\
