  \ new in my cupboard at The Dabbler. This week, a brief note on a forgotten drama\
  \ by the author of God Save The King/Queen, Henry Carey (c.1687\u20131743), together\
  \ with a link to the complete text. I hope this will be of interest to any clapped-out\
  \ old thespians among my readership. Word has it that the Bodger's Spinney Variety\
  \ Theatre will be mounting a star-studded production of the play in lieu of this\
  \ year's Christmas panto.\n[2010-11-26]"
