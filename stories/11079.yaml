text: "The Appointed Pointy Panel of the Pointy Town Institute of Pointiness was rocked\
  \ to its foundations yesterday by explosive revelations of malfeasance, perfidy,\
  \ and pelf. Unnamed sources suggested that the entire edifice could be brought crashing\
  \ to the ground.\n\u201CLet there be no mistake,\u201D said the source, \u201CThere\
  \ has been malfeasance at the highest levels, as well as perfidy and pelf, and not\
  \ only at the highest levels but at several lower strata. Quite how we go forward\
  \ following these explosive revelations is unclear. But go forward we shall, pointedly.\u201D\
  \nThe revelations first threatened to become combustible shortly after breakfast\
  \ time, and exploded immediately thereafter. So explosive were the explosions that\
  \ trees, including planes, poplars, pines, larches, sycamores, and yews were flattened,\
  \ and birds dropped dead from the sky. An eerie orangey purply yellowish mist o'erspread\
  \ Pointy Town, rendering most of the pointiest bits barely visible.\n\u201CI have\
  \ not seen anything like this since that business of the illegal picnicking hoo-hah\
  \ of yore,\u201D said one old-timer, a grizzled stoaty fellow leaning against a\
  \ wall in a pointy part of town. So ancient was he that nobody else had a clue what\
  \ he was talking about.\nOther Pointy Towners were more, or less, circumspect. Some\
  \ were not circumspect at all. Several had difficulty grasping the concept of circumspection,\
  \ and of pointiness, and even of malfeasance and perfidy and pelf.\n\u201CPersonally\
  \ I can't see what all the fuss is about,\u201D said a man who gave his name as\
  \ Unanugu, standing hopelessly at a decommissioned bus stop, \u201CI am just waiting\
  \ for the 666, even though the little dwarvish familiar perched on my shoulder,\
  \ invisible to all but me, tells me it will never pass this way again. But if I\
  \ believed everything it told me I would not be a salt of the earth citizen of Pointy\
  \ Town, would I?\u201D\nMarkets reacted in juddering fashion to the explosive revelations.\
  \ The pane dropped precipitously, then sprang back up, and kept on springing, until\
  \ it settled, just before dusk, at parity with the grebe.\nEmergency coat hangers\
  \ and tea strainers have been drafted in. The entrails of a slaughtered albino hen\
  \ will be read today at midday by a haruspex with a klaxon on a balcony in a thunderstorm.\n\
