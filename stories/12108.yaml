text: "The following is a comparative estimate of the dimensions of the Head of the\
  \ inhabitants in several counties of England.\nThe male Head in England, at maturity,\
  \ averages from 6 and a half to 7 and five-eighths inches in diameter; the medium\
  \ and most general size being 7 inches. The female head is smaller, varying from\
  \ 6 and three-eighths to 7 or 7 and a half inches, the medium male size. Fixing\
  \ the medium of the English head at 7 inches, there can be no difficulty in distinguishing\
  \ the portions of society above from those below that measurement.\nLondon \u2013\
  \ The majority of the higher classes are above the medium, while among the lower\
  \ it is very rare to find a large head.\nSpitalfields Weavers have extremely small\
  \ heads, 6 and a half, 6 and five-eighths, 6 and three-quarter inches being the\
  \ prevailing admeasurements.\nCoventry\u2014Almost exclusively peopled by weavers;\
  \ the same facts are peculiarly observed.\nHertfordshire, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk\
  \ contain a larger proportion of small heads than any part of the empire; Essex\
  \ and Hertfordshire particularly. 7 inches in diameter is here, as in Spitalfields\
  \ and Coventry, quite unusual. 6 and five-eighths or 6 and a half are more general;\
  \ and 6 and three-eighths, the usual size for a boy of six years of age, is frequently\
  \ to be met with here in the full maturity of manhood.\nKent, Surrey, and Sussex\u2014\
  An increase of size of the usual average is observed; and the inland counties, in\
  \ general, are nearly upon the same scale.\nDevonshire and Cornwall \u2013 The heads\
  \ of full sizes.\nHerefordshire\u2014Superior to the London average.\nLancashire,\
  \ Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Northumberland have more large heads, in proportion,\
  \ than any part of the country.\nScotland\u2014The full-sized head is known to be\
  \ possessed by the inhabitants; their measurement ranging between 7 and three-quarters\
  \ and 7 and seven-eighths even to 8 inches. This extreme size, however, is rare.\n\
