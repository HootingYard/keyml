text: "\nEight years and one month ago, I posted the following horoscope here at Hooting\
  \ Yard:\nOur horoscopes are based on the so-called Blodgett Astrological System\
  \ of six, rather than twelve, signs. Over many years, forecasts made under this\
  \ system have proved over eight hundred and forty-eight times more reliable than\
  \ all that Pisces and Aquarius nonsense! You can work out which sign you are by\
  \ referring to the absolutely splendid up to date online guide at www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/humanfate.html\
  \ (site under construction).\nFruitbat. Try to remember that you are lactose-intolerant.\
  \ The hours before twilight will be significant for your pet stoat. Throw away that\
  \ tub of swarfega.\nMayonnaise. It is time to dig out your copy of Gordon \u201C\
  Sting\u201D Sumner's profound I Hope The Russians Love Their Children Too and play\
  \ it again after all these years. You may overhear the phrase \u201Cgoing postal\u201D\
  \ more than once this afternoon. Pay special attention to patches of bracken.\n\
  Coathanger. Your recurrent nightmares about an albino hen will finally make sense.\
  \ Don't go near any buildings, large or small.\nSlot. At last your destiny will\
  \ begin to unfold, probably as you take a stroll along the towpath of the old canal.\
  \ Vengeful thoughts will assail your brain, but you should ignore them, and devote\
  \ your energies to making jam. A hollyhock may have special meaning for your kith\
  \ and kin.\nTarboosh. O what can ail thee, horoscope reader, alone and palely loitering?\
  \ Make sure you treat yourself to an electric bath and a session in a sensory deprivation\
  \ tank. The Bale of Gas in your House of Stupidity has incalculable effects. You\
  \ will stand on the steps of the Insane Asylum, and hundreds of men and women will\
  \ stand below you, with their upturned faces. Among them will be old men crushed\
  \ by sorrow, and old men ruined by vice; aged women with faces that seemed to plead\
  \ for pity, women that make you shrink from their unwomanly gaze; lion-like young\
  \ men, made for heroes but caught in the devil's trap and changed into beasts; and\
  \ boys whose looks show that sin has already stamped them with its foul insignia,\
  \ and burned into their souls the shame which is to be one of the elements of its\
  \ eternal punishment. A less impressible person than you would feel moved at the\
  \ sight of that throng of bruised and broken creatures. A hymn will be read, and\
  \ when the preachers strike up an old tune, voice after voice will join in the melody\
  \ until it swells into a mighty volume of sacred song. You will notice that the\
  \ faces of many are wet with tears, and there will be an indescribable pathos in\
  \ their voices. The pitying God, amid the rapturous hallelujahs of the heavenly\
  \ hosts, shall bend to listen to the music of these broken harps.\nNixon. Vile dribbling\
  \ goblins covered in boils will make life difficult today.\nWhy am I returning to\
  \ this old horoscope today?, you may ask. Well, for eight years I have been ignoring\
  \ a cardboard box full of letters which I received in the days after this postage\
  \ appeared. The box\u2014or rather its contents\u2014gnawed at my conscience. Gnaw,\
  \ gnaw, gnaw. I have had a terrible time. If you have ever felt reproached by sight\
  \ of a cardboard box, you will understand what I have been going through. That is\
  \ why I hid the box in a cubby and buried it beneath a pile of rags and locked the\
  \ cubby and took a bus to the seaside and hurled the key as far as I could into\
  \ the broiling ocean. I thought, by doing so, I could put those letters out of mind.\
  \ How could I be so na\xEFve?\nAfter a near decade of mental turmoil, yesterday\
  \ I called a locksmith and asked him to fashion a fresh key for the cubby. With\
  \ commendable honesty, given that he was turning down my custom, he pointed out\
  \ that the cubby door was of so flimsy a nature that even a puny person could bash\
  \ it open as easily as smashing an egg. Watch, he said. And he gave the door a thump\
  \ and it fell to bits and there was the pile or rags and, beneath, the cardboard\
  \ box, and, in the box, the letters.\nI plucked from the box the first one that\
  \ came to hand, and read it. Eight years had passed, but I remembered every word.\n\
  Dear Mr Key\nI am writing to complain about the horoscope you posted at Hooting\
  \ Yard yesterday. I was born under the sign of Coathanger, so I was fully expecting\
  \ my nightmares about an albino hen to make some sort of sense. I so arranged things\
  \ that I spent the day in an eerie blasted landscape of marshes and moorland, far,\
  \ oh so far, from any buildings. I awaited revelation, but revelation came there\
  \ none. I can only conclude that your so-called horoscope is a piece of piffle.\
  \ You have ruined my life. I am going to take my case to the Astrological Courts,\
  \ and you will be prosecuted, and all your stars will be blotted out, forever!\n\
  Yours vengefully,\nTim Thurn\nAll the other letters were similar. Complaints, gnashing\
  \ of teeth, rending of garments, rage, threats. Some were written in the blood of\
  \ ducks, never a good sign\u2014and I use the word \u201Csign\u201D significantly.\
  \ I never responded to a single one of these missives. I thought I was in the clear.\
  \ I did not know how grindingly slowly the Astrological Courts worked. But yesterday\
  \ their judgement arrived, in the form of a peculiar light in the sky and a distant\
  \ booming, as of a foghorn or perhaps a bittern. And when night fell, I cast my\
  \ gaze upwards, as I always do, and the sky was empty of stars.\nI still believe\
  \ I did no wrong. I blame Blodgett. I shall appeal to the Astrological Courts, and\
  \ hope for some shred of mercy in the sublunary world.\n[2012-09-14]"
