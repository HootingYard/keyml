text: "The diary of Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb, on this day one hundred years ago:\n\
  I gargled. You gargled. He, she, or it gargled. We gargled. You lot gargled. They\
  \ gargled. That was the gargling done, and it remained only to regargle before getting\
  \ down to the lesser business of the day, the gargling and regargling being, of\
  \ course, the main business, on this day as on every day in the current dispensation.\n\
  I know for a fact that some queer folk like to gargle with stuff that comes prepared\
  \ in bottles available from the chemist's shop, such as Dr Baxter's \u201CZippy\u201D\
  \ Fragrant Spitting Fluid. I abhor those concoctions. I make my own, a mixture of\
  \ ice cold water scooped from the duckpond, table salt, crushed violets, vinegar,\
  \ and goaty milk. The precise quantities of each ingredient I measure out in my\
  \ so-called \u201Cgargling jar\u201D, which in truth is just an ordinary jar with\
  \ horizontal lines scratched on the side with the sharpened ends of a pair of sugar\
  \ tongs. It has served me well these forty years, and will I hope continue to do\
  \ so for as many more years as the Lord sees fit in His ineffable wisdom to grant\
  \ me. Not that I am a religious man. Pious yes, religious no. If there is a Lord,\
  \ then He is a phantom in my head, lodged somewhere between the brain and the skull,\
  \ forever eluding the forceps of enquiry.\nI must admit that there are days when,\
  \ having gargled and regargled, I find myself at something of a loose end. On occasion\
  \ I throw caution to the winds and repair to the bathroom to gargle one more time.\
  \ Spellbinding as this can be, I know it only staves off the inevitable, which is\
  \ to buckle down to all those non-gargling activities with which I am afflicted.\
  \ On any given day these might include: not gargling, taking a constitutional round\
  \ and round the flowerbeds, scooping water from the duckpond, plucking then crushing\
  \ violets, milking several goats, resisting the temptation to regargle, firing off\
  \ a letter to the editor of the Gargling Gazette, shimmying up and down a rope ladder\
  \ as part of military training for a war I am convinced will never come, dispensing\
  \ alms to beggars and widows and orphans, communing with my spirit guide, hooplah!,\
  \ polishing the gargling jar, and writing in a crabbed and barely legible hand in\
  \ my diary. Today I did some of these things, not others, but with a heavy heart.\
  \ I felt drawn, irresistibly, to the bathroom sink, to gargle again, though I knew\
  \ it was madness.\nDr Baxter himself, in spite of his \u201CZippy\u201D potion,\
  \ warns against the dangers of overgargling in a pamphlet distributed by an urchin\
  \ in the village square. I do not think the urchin receives a farthing for his labours.\
  \ Come rain or shine he stands there, weedy and disease-ridden, handing out pamphlets\
  \ to passers-by. \u201CSickness Of The Brain Brought On By More Gargling Than Is\
  \ Wise And Proper\u201D are the words emblazoned on the cover, below which appears\
  \ a mezzotint by the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint showing a horrifying brainsick\
  \ mad person in the throes of unreason. Why does Dr Baxter at one and the same time\
  \ manufacture and sell his spitting fluid while dissuading people from wishing to\
  \ purchase it? The only reason I can think of is that he is brainsick himself, perhaps\
  \ from overgargling.\nMy own head, it must be said, or the brain inside it, has\
  \ not yet succumbed to lunacy. I feel my phantom Lord, nestled within, would tell\
  \ me were it so. He said nothing today, which I count as a perk. And so to cot.\n\
