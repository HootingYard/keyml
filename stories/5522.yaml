  In my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, I have transcribed the words of a children''s
  song appropriate for today''s date.

  The song is taken from a garish publication of the last century entitled Special
  Agent Rastus Blot''s Traditional Songbook For Winsome Tinies. It was a piece of
  spectacular self-aggrandisement by Blot. Though the songs purport to be much-loved
  chants and ditties sung by billions of children around the world, they were all
  in fact devised by the Special Agent himself, and feature him in a starring role,
  carrying out deeds of daring and bravado. When I did some research into the matter,
  I discovered that not one tiny has been heard singing any of these songs, anywhere,
  ever.

  Quite frankly, if you are going to present an urchin with a book as a gift, I would
  give Special Agent Rastus Blot''s farrago of nonsense a wide berth and buy Impugned
  By A Peasant & Other Stories instead.
