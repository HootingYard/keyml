text: 'Today''s advent calendar picture shows a bog, or more precisely a blanket bog.
  (A blanket bog ought not be confused with a Blunkett bog, which is the type of bog
  the blind philandering erstwhile Labour Home Secretary may stumble into when attacked
  by cows.) This particular bog is on Dartmoor, but I suspect it is similar to an
  Isle of Wight bog through which Margo Williams may be dragged by her ghostly spirit
  guides.
