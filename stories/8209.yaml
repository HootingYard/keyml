text: "They say the devil is in the detail, but is that a fact? I decided to find\
  \ out. First of all, though, I wanted to have a better idea of \u201Cthe detail\u201D\
  . I was pretty sure I would know the devil when I saw him, but somehow, paradoxically\
  \ perhaps, \u201Cthe detail\u201D seemed a more nebulous entity. So I turned, as\
  \ always, to the Oxford English Dictionary, which, for its main definition, has\
  \ this to say:\nThe dealing with matters item by item; detailed treatment; attention\
  \ to particulars. Esp. in phrase in (\u2020the) detail , item by item; part by part;\
  \ minutely; circumstantially. So to go into detail , i.e. to deal with or treat\
  \ a thing in its individual particulars.\nFair enough. That gave me somewhere to\
  \ start. If the detail is a minute individual particular item of a thing, what better\
  \ way to test the thesis than by taking something apart, bit by bit, until the devil\
  \ in all his evil burning foulness is found, lurking within\u2014or not, as the\
  \ case may be?\nThe next step was to choose something to dismantle. Now, it must\
  \ be said that I am not the most dexterous of chaps. On the contrary, I am a bit\
  \ of a butterfingers. Dangling on string from the ceiling of my boyhood bedroom\
  \ were many, many Airfix model aeroplanes\u2014Spitfires and Stukas and Messerschmitts\
  \ and Sopwith Camels and Boeing 747s and Parker Double Teenies and Harrier Jump\
  \ Jets and so on\u2014all expertly fitted and glued together and their insignia\
  \ transfers impeccably transferred, but all these were constructed by my older brother,\
  \ with whom I shared a room until I was about ten or eleven. I think I tried, at\
  \ least once, to emulate him, but the resulting plastic plane did not turn out well.\
  \ As I recall, the only successful model I made was a cardboard head of Henry VIII,\
  \ cut and folded from a template printed on the back of a Kellogg's Cornflakes carton.\n\
  It occurred to me that I could just smash something to bits, for generally speaking\
  \ violent smashing requires not dexterity but gung ho and a big hammer. Tempting\
  \ though this was, however, I felt it would be going against the spirit of the project.\
  \ I am not sure that fragments and smithereens count as \u201Cdetails\u201D according\
  \ to the dictionary definition. No, I must be methodical, and pick something apart\
  \ piece by piece, neatly aligning the individual parts on a suitable surface such\
  \ as a baize cloth laid out and flattened smooth upon a tabletop. Green baize would\
  \ make the most suitable background to contrast with the gaudy scarlet hue of the\
  \ devil, were he indeed to be hiding in the detail.\nAfter much reflection, I had\
  \ a brainwave. I was sitting there staring glumly out of the window at some crows,\
  \ humming and hawing whether to dismantle an alarm clock or a bicycle pump or an\
  \ orrery, when it struck me that of course the simplest thing to take to bits would\
  \ be something that was child's play to put together in the first place. Child's\
  \ play, literally. I scampered off to a toyshop and bought a Mr Potato Head.\nFor\
  \ those of you who have put away childish things (First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians,\
  \ 13\_: 11), and put them away so decisively that you can no longer remember who,\
  \ or what, Mr Potato Head is, let me remind you. Mr Potato Head is an American toy\
  \ consisting of a plastic model of a potato which can be decorated with a variety\
  \ of plastic parts that can attach to the main body. These parts usually include\
  \ ears, eyes, shoes, a hat, a nose, and a mouth. The toy was invented and developed\
  \ by George Lerner in 1949, and first manufactured and distributed by Hasbro in\
  \ 1952. The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts that could be\
  \ stuck into a real potato or other vegetable, such as a parsnip or turnip, or even\
  \ a fruit such as a clementine or a Carlsbad plum. Before leaving the toyshop with\
  \ my purchase, I checked to see that the model was sold in its constructed state,\
  \ rather than as a jumble of bits. It would be pointless for me to have to put it\
  \ together before dismantling it, and in any case, if the devil is in the detail\
  \ then he would likely be visibly evident within the Mr Potato Head packaging box,\
  \ his goaty horns and perhaps his pointy fork poking holes in the cardboard or cellophane.\n\
  Back home, I took Mr Potato Head out of his box and set him on the green baize cloth\
  \ upon the tabletop. Was that a whiff of sulphur I smelled? It might have been.\
  \ Perhaps the devil sensed I was closing in on him, and was giving off hellish vapours\
  \ in his panic. Thereagain, would the devil panic at being discovered in the detail?\
  \ He might, rather, be gleeful at being unloosed. I had not thought of that. I sniffed\
  \ again, and took a very careful look at Mr Potato Head, seemingly so innocent upon\
  \ the baize. Was I about to take an awful, irrevocable risk? Was I about to unleash\
  \ Satan from his bondage?\nI gazed into the eyes of Mr Potato Head and asked myself,\
  \ was I being criminally reckless, playing taradiddle with the fate of nations,\
  \ just to prove or disprove a familiar saying? Was there not an easier way? I came\
  \ to the conclusion that I have not studied demonology with sufficient intensity\
  \ to answer the question. And that is why I have made an appointment to see Father\
  \ Ninian Tonguelash, the Jesuit exorcist, to seek his advice, and why Mr Potato\
  \ Head is still sitting, all his constituent parts connected, undismantled, upon\
  \ the baize.\n\n[2012-01-25]"
