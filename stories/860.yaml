  of the sun''s rays which may be shining pitilessly into your kitchen domain. Further
  darkening of the cake can be accomplished by rubbing into it charcoal or play-soot.

  Now empty the contents of a sachet of cuppasoup into a bowl. I know it is called
  cuppasoup, not bowlasoup, but just do as I advise. You can choose whatever flavour
  of soup you desire, but do ensure that it is one heavy with croutons. In fact, however
  many croutons are present in the sachet, add further croutons. If you do not have
  access to a supply of croutons, obtain something hard, like a block of wood or an
  empacture of dried-up mud, and cut it into tiny crouton-sized cubes.

  Boil a kettle. Pour the boiled water into the bowl, sufficient to cover the powdered
  cuppasoup and the croutons and the added croutons. Remove the darkened sponge cake
  from the shadows, and crumble it into the soup.

  Stir and allow to sit undisturbed on a counter until cold. Protect it from the depredations
  of domestic pets, creeping vermin, and wild animals by surrounding the bowl with
  electrified chickenwire.

  For serving, pour the soup out of the bowl into an upturned potter''s cap, and use
  as a source of dunkage for digestive and other biscuits. When you, and your biscuits,
  are exhausted, pour the dregs of the soup into a drainage ditch, clean out the cap
  with soapy, soapy water, and return it to the potter.
