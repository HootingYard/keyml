text: "I am attempting to do a spot of Hooting Yard housekeeping, delving into the\
  \ terrifying innards of WordPress to tweak this website here & there. Frankly, I\
  \ find my brain befuddled, but progress is being made, albeit slowly.\nThus far,\
  \ I have managed to make a couple of updates to the sidebar. A while ago, ResonanceFM\
  \ discontinued its podcasts and, as far as I know, erased them from history. I haven't\
  \ worked out how to remove the podcasty links over to your right, but I have inserted\
  \ a link to the Hooting Yard audio archive on Mixcloud. Shows are available there\
  \ almost as soon as they have been broadcast.\nI recently trod in the puddle of\
  \ Instagram, and have added a sidebar link so you lot can go and look at pictures\
  \ posted by out_of_print_pamphleteer.\nI shall keep you informed of further refinements\
  \ if my brain doers not overheat in the meantime.\nUPDATE\_: I've also inserted\
  \ a sidebar Archives section, where you can browse through the morass of potsages\
  \ [sic] month by month.\nFURTHER UPDATE\_: Those podcast links have now been excised.\
  \ See the Comments, however, for Old Resonance Hooting Yard Podcasts News, and watch\
  \ this space \u2026\n[2017-12-08]"
