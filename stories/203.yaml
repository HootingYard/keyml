  \ new window will open, in which you should type your access code.\nIf you do not\
  \ have an access code yet, where have you been? To get an access code, albeit a\
  \ late one, you must subscribe to the HIMMELFARB Groupuscule Register. Your unique\
  \ access code can be retrieved from the database when you receive a confirmation\
  \ email, unless you are a seedy person, in which case it will be sent by carrier\
  \ cyberpigeon.\nYour access code is different from your password, but must be compatible.\
  \ For help with access codes and passwords, and to check compatibility, you need\
  \ to download a .pdf file from the HIMMELFARB Document Storage Mirror Site closest\
  \ to you. A list of locations is available to unregistered users via wingrotesque.\n\
  If the new window has not opened within five seconds, there is either something\
  \ wrong with your computer, or you have a deeply flawed personality. You may even\
  \ be a seedy person. It is not unknown for the seedy and dissolute to try to gain\
  \ access to HIMMELFARB, more's the pity. But the system is robust and we have a\
  \ proven track record of filtering out such deplorable specimens. Less sympathy,\
  \ more deploring, that's our motto. Much more deploring. Deploring and condemning.\n\
  To view the readme file on our vindictive methods of condemnation, you will need\
  \ to install a plug-in. You can do this even if you are a deplorable and seedy person,\
  \ because the software has been developed in full cooperation with the Holy See\
  \ in Rome. Upon installation, your computer will be imbued with Virtual Sanctity\
  \ (version 4.03) with automatic upgrades. If you are a confessor of a different\
  \ faith, there is no hope for you, no matter how often you sprawl on your prayer\
  \ mat or slaughter a sacrificial goat. You are advised to repent your sins before\
  \ it is too late, and your raiment is torn in shreds and your mouth is filled with\
  \ ashes.\nWe are always seeking to improve the quality of users\u2019 HIMMELFARB\
  \ experience, and we welcome feedback, so long as it is grammatically correct. Those\
  \ of you who write in as if you were a teenage nitwit sending a text message on\
  \ a mobile phone will be subject to condemnation so robust that you will wish you\
  \ had never been born.\n[2007-06-16]"
