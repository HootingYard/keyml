  \ or an eerily exact replica of it? \u201CThe Old Oaken Bucket\u201D\u2014published\
  \ \_in The Wasp, 3rd November 1883\u2014begins thus:\nWith what anguish of mind\
  \ I remember my childhood Recalled in the light of knowledge since gained, The malarious\
  \ farm, the wet, fungus-grown wildwood, The chills then contracted that since have\
  \ remained; The scum-covered duck pond, the pigsty close by it, The ditch where\
  \ the sour-smelling house drainage fell, The damp, shaded dwelling, the foul barnyard\
  \ nigh it\u2014But worse than all else was that terrible well, And the old oaken\
  \ bucket, the mould-crusted bucket, That moss-covered bucket that hung in the well.\n\
