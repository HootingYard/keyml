text: "Dax Pod clad in umber. Dax Pod Uberperson. Atop a large building, as he so\
  \ often is.\n\u201CI am Dax Pod,\u201D he says, \u201CKing of standing atop large\
  \ buildings, declaiming.\u201D\nHe declaims that he is Dax Pod and he is clad in\
  \ umber and is an Uberperson.\nDax Pod fans gather in the street below, peering\
  \ at their hero through binoculars.\nSome fans have lorgnettes. Some fans are bluestockings.\
  \ Dax Pod appeals to them because he knows his Milton, he knows his Sir Thomas Browne,\
  \ he knows his Sylvia Townsend Warner. Sometimes as he stands, clad in umber, in\
  \ his cape, atop a large building, he holds in one hand a literary work by one or\
  \ other of this trio. He can, it is said, recite the entire works of Herman Melville\
  \ from memory, including Pierre, or The Ambiguities.\nHe is a man to be reckoned\
  \ with.\nHe swoops, from atop the large building, wherever and whenever he is needed.\
  \ It may be a postal\_ delivery error, or a dog pound incident, or a planetary cataclysm.\
  \ Whatever it is, Dax Pod swoops.\nDax Pod swoops in his one-piece umber costume,\
  \ for he is Dax Pod and must swoop in umber to placate his fans.\nThey profiled\
  \ him in Gack! Readers saw Dax Pod at home, clad in umber, with umber-clad Mrs Dax\
  \ Pod and the Dax Pod kiddies, all clad in umber too, at their farmhouse, with their\
  \ pigs.\nThe pigs were snorting, wallowing in muck, filthy, filthy, filthy, and\
  \ cloven of hoof.\n[2009-02-16]"
