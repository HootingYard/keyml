text: "Meet me at midday at Wellbeloved Gutters, and we can swap dogs and consider\
  \ the drainage.\nDid I want to exchange Rags for Scamp? It did not seem as if I\
  \ had a choice in the matter. It was not that I had any affection for Rags, he was\
  \ flea-ridden and sick and dishevelled, but he was my Rags. Lord knows I had little\
  \ else to call my own, certainly nothing else living and wheezing.\nI used to have\
  \ my own cart, on wheels, but it toppled down a slope and fell to bits at the bottom.\
  \ I was distracted for a mere moment, by a bittern, or was it a plover?, but a mere\
  \ moment was enough for me to let go of the handle of the cart and for its subsequent\
  \ ruination. Then I was a man without a cart. Shortly afterwards, I obtained Rags,\
  \ by accident, outside a milk bar. The dog attached itself to me. It followed me\
  \ home, if you can call the wooden pallet in the shelter of the viaduct home.\n\
  I called it home, for a month or two, before fate swept me up and plopped me in\
  \ a hotel. Rags had to stay outside, on a patch of ground near the car park. I fashioned\
  \ a kennel for him out of bits of hardboard and nails. The patch was in the lee\
  \ of one of the hotel's huge forbidding windowless back walls. I know nothing of\
  \ architecture, but it struck me as an unusually designed building. The innards\
  \ were somewhere between palatial and gaudy. What a trick fate played to plop me\
  \ there!\nI tried to imagine Scamp\u2014big, bounding, brisk, panting Scamp\u2014\
  sitting half-in, half-out of the kennel, eating from Rags's bowl, in the shadow\
  \ of the hotel. I tried and failed. So I went down to the lobby and asked for some\
  \ notepaper and scribbled a reply.\nI will meet you at midday at Wellbeloved Gutters.\
  \ I am happy to consider the drainage. But a dog-swap is out of the question, for\
  \ the time being.\nI pressed a coin into the mitt of an urchin and sent him off\
  \ to deliver my message. Then I obtained some bones and jelly and went out the back\
  \ to feed Rags. His chain had been smashed to pieces, as if by a maniac's axe. Untethered,\
  \ Rags had fled. I returned to the lobby, slumped in an armchair next to a palm\
  \ tree, and bunched my fists.\nLater, torrential rain fell on Wellbeloved Gutters.\
  \ The rain drained away as rapidly as it fell, for they are highly efficient gutters,\
  \ probably the most efficient gutters in Pointy Town.\n[2014-06-08]"
