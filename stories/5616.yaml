text: "When keeping a tally of gnomes, it is important to be aware of the different\
  \ varieties, including newly-discovered types of gnome. It is all very well being\
  \ able to spot, for example, well-known gnomes such as garden gnomes, the gnomes\
  \ of Zurich, and Rudolf Steiner's curiously disturbing invisible gnomes, but what\
  \ will it profit a man if he tallies up some types of gnome but overlooks others\
  \ entirely?\nConsider, for example, the exhausted pipe-cleaner gnomes mentioned\
  \ in passing on page 149 of Kate Atkinson's novel Started Early, Took My Dog (2010).\
  \ To the best of my knowledge, these busy little fellows have not previously been\
  \ recorded in any authoritative list of gnome-types. Now they have been brought\
  \ to light, however, it is clear that one must keep an eye out for them when conducting\
  \ a gnome tally.\nMs Atkinson has little to say about them, although she does note\
  \ their propensity for drunkenness. We should not be surprised at this, for it does\
  \ not take much to intoxicate a gnome. And we can hardly begrudge these gnomes their\
  \ pots of foaming Norwegian lager after a hard day's pipe-cleaning. Even though\
  \ you are not a gnome, I expect you too would be exhausted if you were up at the\
  \ crack of dawn, armed with a scrubbing brush and a bucket of bleach, off to clean\
  \ pipes until nightfall.\nGnomes are particularly suited to cleaning duties, of\
  \ course, even when suffering from hangovers, as they usually are. Yet somehow in\
  \ his magisterial survey of common gnome occupations, Bl\xF6tzmann omits the pipe-cleaner\
  \ gnomes, jumping, in his alphabetic list, from oilrig janitor gnomes directly to\
  \ potting shed snack preparation gnomes. From this we can conclude that the exhausted\
  \ pipe-cleaner gnomes have deliberately concealed their existence from the wider\
  \ world, more successfully even than Steiner's creepy invisible gnomes, which is\
  \ saying something. The alternative is that Bl\xF6tzmann failed to notice them,\
  \ which would mean that his survey is not as magisterial as we have been led to\
  \ believe. Frankly, that doesn't bear thinking about. One thing we learn from any\
  \ half-competent gnome tally is that calling Bl\xF6tzmann's expertise into question\
  \ unleashes those terrible, terrible Bl\xF6tzmann Reputation Protection gnomes,\
  \ with their sharpened pins and hallucinatory facial expressions.\n[2010-11-28]"
