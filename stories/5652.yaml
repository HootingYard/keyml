text: "Sabine Baring-Gould Week continues, with another snippet from Purcell's biography.\
  \ It is 1867, and our hero (aetat. 33) has been appointed to the position \u201C\
  with the depressing title of Perpetual Curate\u201D to Dalton\u2026\n\u201CDalton,\
  \ a hamlet in Swaledale, was called, not without reason, \u2018Dalton i't Muck\u2019\
  , by reason of the remarkable amount of mud through which its few inhabitants had\
  \ in winter to make their way. A profusion of wild flowers in summer was an agreeable\
  \ feature of the place though somewhat outweighed by at least three disadvantages:\
  \ the smallness of the stipend, the stupidity of the people, and the enthusiasm\
  \ of the Viscountess Downe\u2026\n\u201CThe natives were perhaps affected by the\
  \ mud.\u201D\nI am reminded of Ruskin's peasants of the Vaudois valleys, \u201C\
  where the marshes\u2026 blast their helpless inhabitants into fevered idiotism\u201D\
