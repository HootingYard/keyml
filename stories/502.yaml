text: "For most of us, the words \u201CNightingale Board\u201D call to mind that empanelled\
  \ panel of eminent persons who devote valuable time to the counting and measuring\
  \ and tallying and calculating of nightingales and nightingale populations, their\
  \ habitats, flight patterns, wingspans, song variations and much else that is nightingale-related,\
  \ sometimes tangentially. I have been meaning to write about the Nightingale Board\
  \ for some time now, and regret the distractions of voodoo pig husbandry, ditch\
  \ digging, aimless lolloping and despair which have prevented me from doing so.\
  \ What I had in mind was to do a comparative study of the Nightingale Board and\
  \ the Hummingbird Board, the latter an equally tireless band of empanelled persons\
  \ who count and measure and tally and calculate all things hummingbird-related.\
  \ I had, in fact, set aside this morning to attack the project with vim and verve,\
  \ having farmed out the voodoo pig husbandry and ditch digging to a paid companion,\
  \ made a promise to myself not to lollop, aimlessly or otherwise, and countered\
  \ despair by drinking an infusion of Baxter's Perky-Uppy Expectorant Fluid. After\
  \ vomiting into an iron pail, I planned to sit down and bash out thousands of words\
  \ on both the Nightingale Board and the Hummingbird Board.\nAlas! As I wiped my\
  \ chin with a rag, the postie brought a letter from Hooting Yard reader Roland Clare,\
  \ drawing my attention to a completely different Nightingale Board. Mr Clare has\
  \ borrowed from his brother a book entitled Small Homes And How To Furnish Them\
  \ by Mrs Waldemar Leverton, published in London in 1903 by C Arthur Pearson Ltd.\n\
  \nWith great diligence, Mr Clare has executed some photorealist pencil drawings\
  \ of selected paragraphs from the book, the first of which tells us about this other\
  \ Nightingale Board:\n\nElsewhere in the book there is a splendid passage instructing\
  \ the reader on the important matter of toy owl construction:\n\nAccording to Mr\
  \ Clare, it is thought that \u201CMrs Waldemar Leverton\u201D is a pseudonym, an\
  \ anagram of the name of the true author of this excellent book, the Rev. Lowland\
  \ Stammerer. Intriguingly, that godly man was a founder member of the very first\
  \ Nightingale Board to be empanelled in his bailiwick. He may also have been involved\
  \ in the Hummingbird Board, though my researches into that must sadly be postponed\
  \ yet again, for I must lollop aimlessly now, in despair, while my paid companion\
  \ husbands voodoo pigs and digs a ditch.\n[2008-08-07]"
