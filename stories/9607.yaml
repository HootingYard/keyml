text: "I don't know if any television network commissioning wankers editors read Hooting\
  \ Yard, but I certainly hope so, because I have had a fantastic idea for a show.\
  \ It is a panel game called My Favourite Owl. The idea is that every week, four\
  \ panellists would each be given an hour to sing the praises of their favourite\
  \ owl. I do not mean they would actually sing, as there are already plenty of television\
  \ programmes where people wail and caterwaul to no good purpose. No, I mean simply\
  \ that the panellists would make the case for their favourite owl being the best\
  \ owl of the four extolled on that week's show. The chairman, who would ideally\
  \ be me, or if not me then a neglected genius, would then decide which of the four\
  \ owls was the winner.\nThose are the bare bones of the show, and I think any commissioning\
  \ wanker editor worth his or her salt would give it the green light straight away,\
  \ on that basis alone. However, I am given to understand that these people like\
  \ to preen themselves and pretend to an expertise and intelligence they signally\
  \ lack, and thus the creative genius pitching an idea must abase themselves by providing\
  \ unnecessary detail. So here are some further particulars.\nIf I do not get to\
  \ be the chairman, then ideally I would like that role to go to the neglected genius\
  \ Freddie \u201CParrotface\u201D Davies. Older readers may recall him from various\
  \ excruciating light entertainment television shows of the nineteen-seventies. For\
  \ me, however, Davies\u2019 immortality is guaranteed by his appearance in a film,\
  \ Peter Chelsom's masterpiece Funny Bones (1995). As the clapped-out old vaudevillian\
  \ Bruno Parker, Davies is magnificently lugubrious, and one wonders why he was never\
  \ cast in a Samuel Beckett play. It is Davies I see in my mind's eye as the derelict\
  \ and dilapidated protagonists of Beckett's great trilogy of novels Molloy, Malone\
  \ Dies, and The Unnamable. Now in his mid-seventies, Freddie \u201CParrotface\u201D\
  \ Davies could have a late-flowering career resurgence as the host and chairman\
  \ of My Favourite Owl.\n\nI said that each of the four weekly panellists would be\
  \ given an hour to extol their favourite owl. Clearly this means that each episode\
  \ would be at least four-and-a-half hours long, if we take into account the padding\
  \ and faffing. Objections will be raised that this is far too long for a prime-time\
  \ panel game, but I disagree. In a world of ever-decreasing attention spans, my\
  \ show would be striking a blow for something we miss profoundly. In the nineteenth\
  \ century it was quite common for large audiences to be attracted by lengthy talks\
  \ and lectures. In Amusing Ourselves To Death (1985), Neil Postman gives the example\
  \ of a hall full of people held spellbound by a seven-hour address by Abraham Lincoln\u2014\
  and this was before he was president, indeed before he considered running for president.\
  \ And this was not an unusual event. Clearly the human brain is capable of sustained\
  \ concentration, and it is our current Age o\u2019 Pap that is destroying it. Well,\
  \ I, and Freddie \u201CParrotface\u201D Davies, and our owl-loving panellists, will\
  \ restore it to sparkling good health.\nAs for those panellists, who would they\
  \ be, precisely? It is common knowledge, I think, that there is, in Television Centre,\
  \ a cupboard where the dozen or so panel show regulars are kept, to be trundled\
  \ in their chairs into place just before transmission of whatever programme they\
  \ are appearing on that day. Well, we are going to lock that cupboard! Instead of\
  \ the usual suspects, our panels will be composed of owl-loving people we drag in\
  \ off the streets, or rather off the pathways of owl sanctuaries\u2014true enthusiasts,\
  \ who may not be familiar to the audience, but whose eyes gleam with fanatical glee\
  \ when invited to prattle on about owls, uninterrupted, for sixty minutes.\nWe will\
  \ add a further layer of excitement to the show by leaving deliberately vague the\
  \ definition of \u201Cowl\u201D. So, for example, the favourite owl might be one\
  \ particular living owl, one kept as a pet. Or it might be a dead owl, stuffed by\
  \ a taxidermist. It might be not one owl, alive or stuffed, but a type of owl, saw-whet\
  \ or eared or horned or pygmy or stilt or maned or crested or screech or elf or\
  \ scops or hawk or fearful or giant or striped or white-faced or spectacled or laughing\
  \ or earless or little or tawny or barn. Or it might not be a real owl at all, but\
  \ a toy one or a trinket, a glove-puppet, perhaps, or a thing of rags and string\
  \ and glue, or a hideous gewgaw made from seashells, as one might find in a seaside\
  \ resort gift shop, the kind of seaside resort where Freddie \u201CParrotface\u201D\
  \ Davies, or Bruno Parker, would haunt the pier, majestically lugubrious. The fact\
  \ that there are numberless things called \u201Cowls\u201D that might be a panellist's\
  \ favourite suggests that the show could continue, week in week out, for years and\
  \ years.\nI expect eventually it would prove so popular that, slowly but surely,\
  \ all other television shows, including Channel 4 News, would lose their audiences.\
  \ The time will come, I believe, when the only use for a television set will be\
  \ to watch people talking at length about their favourite owl. That day cannot come\
  \ soon enough. In a better world, it would already have come to pass. I just hope\
  \ the commissioning wankers editors are paying attention.\n[2012-07-09]"
