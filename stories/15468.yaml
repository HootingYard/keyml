text: "Here is another golden oldie, buried in the (temporarily hard-to-access) archives.\
  \ It first appeared on the French-Canadian warbler Celine Dion's fortieth birthday.\
  \ The same day, incidentally, was the forty-sixth birthday of MC Hammer, who is\
  \ frightened of hammers.\nThere are some questions we can answer without hesitation.\
  \ Asked \u201Cwhat is your favourite website?\u201D, one hundred percent of sensible\
  \ people immediately shout \u201CHooting Yard of course!\u201D with unhinged and\
  \ hysterical enthusiasm. Similarly, when asked in which schoolbook depository they\
  \ would prefer to site a sniper's nest, an overwhelming number of would-be assassins\
  \ reply \u201Cthe Texas Schoolbook Depository at 411 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75202\u2013\
  3317, without a doubt!\u201D For my part, and in spite of the intervening decades,\
  \ a question I can answer without even thinking is \u201Cwhat was your favourite\
  \ weekly comic when you were tiny?\u201D It was The Hammer Of Christ, and, within\
  \ it, the strip I most adored was Buster And Radbod.\nEach week, I followed the\
  \ adventures of the chirpy pair with my jaw dropped and drool flowing freely down\
  \ my chin, my heart and pulse rates pounding desperately. It was through Buster\
  \ and Radbod that I learned to read, and I am forever in their debt.\nThey were,\
  \ in many ways, an ill-matched fictional pair. Buster was squat, hissy, and preening,\
  \ given to throwing fits and always attired in a bright yellow duffel coat and a\
  \ little pointed wooden cap. He existed on a diet of chocolate swiss rolls, sprats,\
  \ lettuce, and untreated milk straight from the goat. We were never given a glimpse\
  \ of the goat, but it was understood that it lived in a field a short walk across\
  \ the verdant hills from Buster's house and that its name was Buttercup. Buster\
  \ had more than one iron pail in which he would collect the milk, one painted red\
  \ and one unpainted, and a third, extra special pail that leaked and that he was\
  \ always promising to mend, but never did. Buster had too many teeth crammed inside\
  \ his mouth, certainly more than a non-fictional person would have, and some of\
  \ them were sharpened into fangs. He liked to sit atop a rotating plinth and spin\
  \ round and round until he was sick. I was always curious as to the engine which\
  \ rotated the plinth. It bore a distinct resemblance to undersea drilling equipment\
  \ I had seen, either in real life or in catalogues, although of course nearly all\
  \ of Buster and Radbod's adventures took place on dry land, far from the sea. Buster\
  \ was once or twice shown to be in possession of a pair of swimming trunks, they\
  \ were visible in pictures of his open wardrobe, alongside a snorkel and an oxygen\
  \ canister, but I cannot recall him ever wearing them. Buster had an owl as well\
  \ as a goat. The owl was also called Buttercup, and Buster treated it cruelly, often\
  \ pelting it with the shells of pistachio and Brazil nuts throughout the impossibly\
  \ long afternoons of his idyllic fictional summertime. The owl took its revenge\
  \ by regurgitating gobbets of semi-digested stoat or weasel on to Buster's pointed\
  \ wooden cap, which he would then have to rinse clean under the village spigot.\
  \ Doing so was always a risky business, for lumbering in the vicinity of the village\
  \ spigot was the village wrestler, a hairy brute capable of tearing an anvil in\
  \ half with his great hairy hands. Luckily for Buster, the village wrestler was\
  \ chained to a post next to the village spigot, and he was blind, so usually it\
  \ was possible to skip nimbly out of his reach, even though, being squat, Buster\
  \ was not the most nimble of cartoon characters. Indeed, he was not nimble at all.\
  \ He slouched and he trudged and he often trailed one of his legs behind him, as\
  \ if he were a lame child, but this was just rascality. Buster pretended to be lame\
  \ to diddle small coinage from shopkeepers and the ground staff at the aerodrome,\
  \ but most of them were wise to his tricks. In quite a few stories Buster and Radbod\
  \ mooched around the aerodrome, trying to enter the hangars, but they were invariably\
  \ stymied by one circumstance or another, be it the weather or early closing or\
  \ an attack of killer bees or a rusty padlock. Once they were about to step into\
  \ an unguarded and unlocked hangar when they were surprised by the ghost of Sylvia\
  \ Townsend Warner and fled screaming into the hills. Other literary phantoms haunted\
  \ the comic strip from time to time, for differing narrative purposes, and not always\
  \ at the aerodrome. The ghost of Emily Dickinson, for example, hovers in mid-air\
  \ outside the village shampooist in several frames of a particularly exciting adventure\
  \ in which a toggle on Buster's duffel coat is discovered to be a smooth round fragment\
  \ from the tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. Buster hires a broom to fight off\
  \ the ancient Egyptian ghouls who come to reclaim the pharaoh's toggle. The hiring\
  \ of brooms, sweeping brushes, dusters, squeegees, rags and other cleaning materials\
  \ is one of Buster's hobbies, along with bell-ringing, stamp collecting, making\
  \ fluted paper cupcake cases, pelting his owl with the shells of pistachio and Brazil\
  \ nuts, First World War battle re-enactments, tongue twisters, snakes and ladders,\
  \ playing songs from the Fort Mudge Memorial Dump LP on the glockenspiel, churning\
  \ up froth in a pail, bandage sculpture, tick tack, tacky tock, driving nails into\
  \ mud idols, Subbuteo table football, poop tack clatter tack whizz, ping pong, hopping\
  \ about flapping his arms, conjuring tricks, removing splinters from gashes, cardboard\
  \ appreciation, amateur dramatics, pencil sharpening, scattering pins all over the\
  \ place, bowling, bowls and dishes, and running a flea circus. I thought of Buster\
  \ rather than Radbod as a role model. Buster had nonchalance, \xE9lan, a filthy\
  \ temper, a ready wit, and peevishness. He was insouciant when one of his lungs\
  \ collapsed. He smoked Gitanes. He sometimes wore his pointed wooden cap at a jaunty\
  \ angle. He could hold his breath under water for several very very tense minutes.\
  \ He rattled about in a fantastic old jalopy. He had ambitions to be a bargee on\
  \ an extensive system of canals. He was a dab hand with a banjo, and not in a musical\
  \ sense. Once, he felled the blind brute village wrestler with a simple flick of\
  \ his duffel coat cuff, and afterwards had the grace to polish the blind brute village\
  \ wrestler's chain with a hired rag and his own home-made swarfega. He dazzled at\
  \ cocktail parties. He spat upon hissing coals. He tiptoed from rooms with a swish\
  \ of elegance. He was off on a frolic of his own.\nRadbod, by contrast, was a somewhat\
  \ colourless character.\nRecently I learned that a complete set of The Hammer Of\
  \ Christ, bound in the hide of a cloven-hooved beast of the barnyard, and containing\
  \ all the adventures of Buster and Radbod, will be for sale at an auction to be\
  \ held at the dilapidated Custom House by the harbour steps in the stinking seaside\
  \ resort where I usually spend my holidays. I am by no stretch of the imagination\
  \ an experienced auction-goer, and I have no idea how to make a bid. Do I nod, or\
  \ raise an eyebrow, or hold up a pencil, or flail my arms around? I do not want\
  \ to cut an idiotic figure, but nor do I want to miss the chance to get my hands\
  \ on such a treasure. It is a quandary, to be sure.\nHaving given it much thought,\
  \ I have decided to take my lead from Buster himself. In one episode of this most\
  \ marvellous of comic strips, he goes to an auction at a Custom House, not unlike\
  \ the auction at the Custom House I plan to attend, and, when the lot he covets\
  \ comes up, he sneaks outside and, through an aperture, pumps into the auction room\
  \ a fast-acting nerve gas. Or maybe it is just any old gas, I can't quite remember.\
  \ I suppose that's something I ought to check before carrying out my nefarious plan.\
  \ If I pump the wrong sort of gas through an aperture, who knows what might happen?\
  \ The problem is that, just as I am ignorant of bidding protocol at auctions, I\
  \ haven't got a clue about gases. I know there are lots of different kinds of gas\
  \ and that they act differently upon the people gathered in a room into which one\
  \ or other of them is pumped through an aperture, but how I am to go about picking\
  \ my gas is an absolute mystery. And so, for now, it shall remain, for there is\
  \ much that trumps gas research in my daily round, and right now I feel, as I so\
  \ often do, the call of the monkey, and I must pick nits out of my hair and shovel\
  \ bananas down my throat and swing from larch to sycamore in my larch and sycamore\
  \ enclosure, beyond the back garden, by the railway lines, where hooting freight\
  \ trains thunder along the track carrying vast loads of pig iron to Pig Iron Town,\
  \ where I have never been, and will never go, for it is far, far away, and built\
  \ entirely from pig iron.\n[2017-07-24]"
