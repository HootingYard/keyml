text: 'Behold the Nylon Duke. He is fashioned entirely from nylon, every last bit
  of him, yea, even unto his cartilages. He is a nylon wonder of the world.

  The Nylon Duke is pulled along, flat on his back, on a cart, by a great grey drayhorse
  with its bright and battering sandal, from village to village. At each stop along
  the way, in villages leafy or otherwise, he is hoisted upright by a system of winches
  and pulleys. The villagers gather and gasp and gawp at the sight of the Nylon Duke.
  They bring offerings of potatoes and similar root vegetables, piled high on the
  cart before being transferred into sacks by the Nylon Duke''s attendants. These
  attendants are not made of nylon.

  Elsewhere, there is a Nylon Duchess, and there may be a Nylon Dauphin, and there
  are even rumours of a Nylon Dunce. But in this land there are not enough great grey
  drayhorses to pull them on carts around villages. A Dearth Of Drayhorses is an oft-reprinted
  tract which goes some way to explaining this situation.

  Consider the Nylon Duke in the round, in all his pomp and finery and nylonosity.
  Would you begrudge him your potatoes? Think hard before you answer, for fig eider
  remprent, scou binder ad fig, as it is written, as it is engraved, as it is tattooed
  upon the foreheads of the attendants.

  The Nylon Duke''s given name is Bob.
