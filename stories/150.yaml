text: "In a piece on the Guardian Books Blog, Lee Rourke identifies \u201Cthe greatest\
  \ first line of any novel I have ever read\u201D, the opening of Ann Quin's Berg:\
  \ \u201CA man called Berg, who changed his name to Greb, came to a seaside town\
  \ intending to kill his father . . .\u201D Some of the commenters propose their\
  \ own favourite first lines, and one links to a list of the \u201Chundred best\u201D\
  \ from a website called LitLine. There is no explanation of how the hundred were\
  \ selected, or by whom, but it makes for an occasionally intriguing read.\nI had\
  \ been thinking of compiling a list of the hundred best opening lines from out of\
  \ print pamphlets by Dobson, and maybe one day I will do so. Certainly near the\
  \ top of the list would be \u201CThere was a thunderstorm, and I discovered I had\
  \ mislaid my bus pass\u201D from How I Mislaid My Bus Pass During A Thunderstorm.\n\
  Meanwhile, having managed to type a couple of paragraphs while wheezing and spluttering\
  \ due to my fever-racked condition, I am going to reward myself with A Nice Cup\
  \ Of Tea And A Sit Down.\n[2007-05-11]"
