text: "\nDaniel Barenboim has won many plaudits for his creation of the West-Eastern\
  \ Divan Orchestra, bringing together young musicians from different countries in\
  \ the Middle East to promote the cause of peace. Laudable as his efforts are, several\
  \ observers have noted that the world of classical music is too small and narrow\
  \ to have real societal heft. Pop music, they say, is the lingua franca that can\
  \ genuinely bring people of different faiths together. To this end, and as a faltering\
  \ first step in resolving the simmering civil war between the two major branches\
  \ of Islam, a new single has been released. It is a new version of \u201CI Got You\
  \ Babe\u201D by Sunni and Shia.\n[2017-09-06]"
