text: "\u201CGet carter!\u201D\nThat was my instruction, that morning, from the overseer.\
  \ But there were so many carters passing along the lane, driving their carts to,\
  \ or back from, the market square in the village, that I had no idea which carter\
  \ to get. Nor did I have a clue what to do with the carter when I got him, other\
  \ than to take him to the overseer.\nSo I hid behind a splurge of lupins beside\
  \ the lane, lying in wait for a carter weedy enough for me to overpower. I realised\
  \ I may have to wait quite some time, for all the carters passing by were big burly\
  \ types who would swat me aside with their fists and forearms. My name is Vercingetorix,\
  \ and I am puny.\nMy instruction was to get a carter, not their cart, but I could\
  \ not just leave a carterless cart abandoned in the lane. It would attract remark,\
  \ and remark could lead to pursuit, and pursuit to capture, and capture to blows\
  \ and bruises and blood. When getting my carter, I would have to shove their cart\
  \ off the lane and conceal it behind a splurge of lupins or, better, a hedge, where\
  \ it would go unremarked. This was going to prove more difficult than I thought.\n\
  The sun was high and searing when at last, along the lane, came toiling a weedy-looking\
  \ carter pulling a creaky old cart piled high with what I took to be turnips. Fortunate\
  \ for me that this was a land without horses, or indeed pack animals of any description,\
  \ for that saved me an additional quandary. I had only to get a carter and hide\
  \ a cart, not hide a horse or donkey into the bargain.\nI sprang out into the lane\
  \ in front of the weedy carter.\n\u201CHalt!\u201D I cried.\nThe carter, startled,\
  \ pulled from his cummerbund a firearm, cocked it, and pointed it at my head. Reluctantly,\
  \ I had to let him pass, and I scuttled back behind the splurge of lupins.\nThe\
  \ next few passing carters were of the big and burly type, so I dared not spring\
  \ out in front of any of them. I hid and hummed quietly and smoked and popped open\
  \ a can of Squelcho! to quench my thirst. Towards noon there was a lull in cart-traffic,\
  \ so I took the opportunity to practise my springing, leaping out into the lane\
  \ and waving my arms in an alarming manner, shouting my head off. In doing so I\
  \ spilled some of my Squelcho! but the little puddle it formed was soon lapped up\
  \ by a dog. This dog appeared to be a dog without a master, and I wondered if it\
  \ might be a helpful ally in my mission to get a carter. If I sent it bounding out\
  \ from behind the splurge of lupins, yapping, it might disconcert a weedy dog-frightened\
  \ carter long enough for me to get him and shove his cart out of sight.\nI beckoned\
  \ to the dog. I have a way with animals. I inspire pathetic devotion in dogs, cats,\
  \ squirrels, even geese and leafcutter ants, just by my beckoning manoeuvre, a sort\
  \ of gentle sweeping of the arm accompanied by intricate hand movements and a whispered\
  \ incantation. Sure enough, the masterless dog followed me to my place of concealment\
  \ behind the splurge of lupins. Immediately, I set about training it to yap at a\
  \ carter. For this purpose, I fashioned a sort of makeshift cart out of the empty\
  \ Squelcho! can and some twigs and lupin-petals. It didn't look much like a cart,\
  \ but I mimed pulling it and pushing it in a straight line, as if along the lane,\
  \ to represent which I scored a groove in the patch of ground behind the splurge\
  \ of lupins with the heel of my winklepicker. The dog gazed at me adoringly.\nAll\
  \ of this took quite some time, and I quite neglected to keep an eye out for passing\
  \ carters. Indeed, several weedy specimens I could have overpowered, even without\
  \ the dog, went a-trundling their carts along the lane, as I learned later when\
  \ reviewing the CCTV footage, back at the depot. The overseer was not best pleased.\
  \ He ranted at me, while the dog cowered behind a filing cabinet. He called me a\
  \ nitwit and a knave and several other choice words. I had been given a simple task,\
  \ to get carter, and instead I was found faffing about behind a splurge of lupins\
  \ with a dog and an empty can of Squelcho! and twigs and petals. I was not only\
  \ puny, I was hopeless and incompetent. Still, the overseer was willing to give\
  \ me one more chance. He told me to report to him the next morning for a new instruction.\n\
  \u201CWill do!\u201D I piped up, trying to show enthusiasm. \u201CCan I bring the\
  \ dog?\u201D I added.\nHe shook his fist in my face and told me to begone.\nThe\
  \ next morning I turned up bright and early at the depot, dog in tow. The overseer\
  \ was rummaging through paperwork and barely glanced at me. I wondered if he wanted\
  \ me to get carter again. But no.\n\u201CBring me the head of Alfredo Garcia!\u201D\
  \ he shouted.\n[2011-09-28]"
