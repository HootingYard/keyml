text: "I have received a bat-letter from Miss Dimity Cashew.\nDear Mr Key, she writes,\
  \ Like most people, I have always believed that the hideous bat god Fatso is the\
  \ most terrifying of all bat deities. This has been an article of faith for as long\
  \ as I can remember. However, I recently stumbled upon Wayne Ferrebee's blog Ferrebeekeeper,\
  \ where I discovered some rather alarming details about Camazotz, the Death Bat.\
  \ Now, while I am no expert on bat deities and their varying levels of hideousness,\
  \ violence, and terror, it seems to me that Camazotz would prove a formidable opponent\
  \ were he and the hideous bat god Fatso pitted against each other in some kind of\
  \ apocalyptic clash of bat deities. Your views on the likely outcome of such a battle\
  \ would be much appreciated, also of course the betting odds, in case I fancied\
  \ taking a flutter.\nYours primly, Dimity Cashew (Miss)\nPS\u2014I enclose a snapshot\
  \ of Camazotz from Mr Ferrebee's blog, so you can appreciate just how terrifying\
  \ he is. The bat god I mean, not Mr Ferrebee, obviously.\nRather than bashing out\
  \ an impromptu reply, I think I shall need to embark upon some serious bat god research\
  \ before jumping to any conclusions. Watch this space.\n\n[2011-07-06]"
