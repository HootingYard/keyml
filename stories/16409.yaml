text: "Yesterday's little winklepicker squib reminded me of a piece I wrote about\
  \ the pier at Deal in July 2012. Here it is again:\n\nAbove is a photograph of the\
  \ pier at Deal, on the coast of Kent. It is the last pier built in England, opened\
  \ in 1954, replacing a derelict nineteenth-century predecessor. At its far end,\
  \ it terminates in a large platform, lower than the main pier, and from this platform,\
  \ on either side, a set of metal steps lead down into the sea. I think I am right\
  \ in saying this is an unusual construction for a pier. It is a feature that sparked\
  \ an idea in the brain of the writer Rayner Heppenstall (1911\u20131981), who spent\
  \ the last few years of his life as a resident of Deal.\nEarly one morning in the\
  \ late nineteen-seventies, Heppenstall disembarked from a boat and clambered up\
  \ the steps at the end of the pier. He had come from France, brought across the\
  \ channel by a somewhat rascally French sailor, who would collect him from the same\
  \ spot on the evening of the same day. Heppenstall walked along the pier to shore,\
  \ and through Deal's dawn-deserted streets to his house. He was careful to ensure\
  \ he was not seen. As far as friends and neighbours were concerned, he was on holiday\
  \ in France. He spent the day, very quietly, at home, reading over his diaries of\
  \ the last few years. Heppenstall was a diligent diarist all his life, and often\
  \ used them as raw material for his fiction, after which he would destroy the originals.\
  \ He had brought a packed lunch with him, so he would not need to prepare anything\
  \ and thus create cooking smells. Similarly, when he smoked during the day he dispersed\
  \ the fumes and removed the evidence from his ashtray. When the cleaner came, in\
  \ the next few days, she would find no sign that Heppenstall had been there.\nWhen\
  \ evening came, and his neighbours had all returned home, Heppenstall took a loaded\
  \ revolver, fitted with a silencer, and went next door, where he slaughtered the\
  \ entire family. He then made his way back to the pier, where he was picked up from\
  \ the steps at the end, and taken back to France.\nOr rather, that is what he wished\
  \ he had done. Many of the entries in his diaries of the time consisted of accounts\
  \ of his neighbours\u2019 behaviour. They were noisy. They were rambunctious. They\
  \ were foul-mouthed. They were working class, or \u201Ccommon\u201D. Beneath the\
  \ cold forensic prose lies Heppenstall's exasperation, his seething rage, his murderousness.\
  \ These are the diary entries he transformed into his last, posthumously-published,\
  \ novel, The Pier (1986). I suppose it is unlikely that the noisy rambunctious working\
  \ class family in Deal ever read the book.\nWhen The Pier appeared, it was taken\
  \ as further evidence that Heppenstall had \u201Cgone mad\u201D. Certainly what\
  \ we read is the lethal fantasy of a man driven crackers by little more than whistling,\
  \ games of kickabout football, loud conversation, and noisy bouts of DIY. One of\
  \ the reasons he and his wife\u2014who becomes his sister in the novel\u2014moved\
  \ to Deal was that their last home in London was a flat above a launderette, the\
  \ din of which he found unbearable. Yet I suspect the real reason he was considered\
  \ to have gone bonkers was the turn his politics took.\nOriginally from Yorkshire,\
  \ Heppenstall had always been a tribal Labour voter, a \u201Cprogressive\u201D.\
  \ Since the end of the Second World War, he had worked as a talks producer for BBC\
  \ Radio. He lived in a literary intellectual milieu. In the nineteen-thirties he\
  \ shared a flat with George Orwell. He was a regular drinking companion of Dylan\
  \ Thomas\u2019. He made the first translation into English of Raymond Roussel (with\
  \ his daughter, Lindy Foord). He published several experimental novels and, in the\
  \ nineteen-sixties was considered a sort of godfather by younger writers such as\
  \ Ann Quin and B S Johnson. Both Quin and Johnson, incidentally, committed suicide\
  \ in 1973. Heppenstall didn't, but considered doing so. For more than three decades\
  \ he kept concealed behind his bookshelves a phial of crushed pink pills diluted\
  \ in water, which he regularly refreshed to maintain its potency. It was his guarantee\
  \ that death was always in his reach. In the end, he never took it. He died of a\
  \ stroke.\nIt was around the time of his retirement from the BBC, in 1973, and his\
  \ move to Deal the following year, that Heppenstall began to describe himself as\
  \ a \u201Cfreelance reactionary\u201D. Come 1979, he even considered voting Conservative,\
  \ though he very probably did not vote at all. But the break from the world and\
  \ the mindset he had inhabited is all too clear in some of his diary entries. It\
  \ is unlikely his colleagues in the BBC canteen or the London drinking clubs would\
  \ have taken kindly to his analysis of the Middle East, that \u201Cthe Jews are\
  \ a civilised race, whereas the Arabs are basically savages\u201D. He came increasingly\
  \ to loathe the modern world.\nWas this madness? The reactionary views, the suicide\
  \ phial, the murderous fantasy? Perhaps it was something in the air in Deal, home\
  \ to other London exiles such as the alcoholic Charles Hawtrey (thrown out of every\
  \ pub in town at one time or another) and Simon Raven. Hawtrey's house bears a blue\
  \ plaque, but there is no commemoration of Rayner Heppenstall. His neighbours, the\
  \ annoying children now adults, may still be living in the same house, all unaware\
  \ that the elderly, withdrawn, ill-tempered writer who once lived next door plotted\
  \ to kill them all.\nI walked along the pier at Deal yesterday, to the steps where\
  \ ghost-Heppenstall came and went on his fantasy killing spree. I passed some loud,\
  \ foul-mouthed, working class people, and also a few well-dressed elderly gents\
  \ taking an afternoon stroll. I wondered if I might see a small French motorboat\
  \ tied up at the end of the pier. But the steps were empty, descending into the\
  \ sloshing sea.\n[2018-03-27]"
