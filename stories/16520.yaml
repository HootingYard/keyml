text: "\u201CThe term \u2018nostalgia\u2019 was in fact dreamt up in 1688 by a doctor\
  \ called Johannes Hofer who was treating young Swiss mercenaries suffering from\
  \ a strange set of symptoms. They wouldn't eat, couldn't summon the will to live\
  \ and sometimes became dangerously ill with no apparent physical cause. They had\
  \ fainting fits, high fevers and indigestion. After talking to the young men, Hofer\
  \ realised they were simply ill for want of home. When he sent them back to the\
  \ mountains, they invariably recovered.\n\u201CEven earlier, Swiss soldiers were\
  \ said to be so susceptible to nostalgia when they heard a particular Swiss milking\
  \ song, \u2018Khue-Reyen\u2019, that its playing was punishable by death.\u201D\n\
