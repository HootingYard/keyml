text: "I went to the shops and bought a foghorn. I thought it would come in handy\
  \ if I were to find myself embroiled in the fog of war. I could toot my foghorn,\
  \ and then \u2026 well, to be honest I hadn't really thought beyond that. But they\
  \ make foghorns for a purpose, and a benign one, so I felt sure that, in the fog\
  \ of war, my foghorn would prove invaluable. It might even save my life.\nAt time\
  \ of writing, I am, or was, fortunate to live in a peaceable kingdom. King Gobbo\
  \ is a peaceable man, and though he has been provoked by certain of our neighbours,\
  \ over matters such as cow pastures and slurry pits and thermonuclear devices, he\
  \ has thus far managed to maintain the peace, either by capitulating to the aggressor's\
  \ demands in a fawning manner, or by laying waste to their territories by deploying\
  \ his fiercely loyal army of psychotic blood-drenched nutcases. Within our borders\u2014\
  and they are very pretty borders\u2014we remain at peace. That being the case, I\
  \ have not yet needed to toot my foghorn.\nI have not needed to, but I tooted it\
  \ anyway, to test it out. There was no fog. It was a clear day. You could see forever.\
  \ I tooted my foghorn. It sounded rather as I imagine a combination of bassoon and\
  \ piccolo would sound, playing a single protracted note, amplified to deafening\
  \ volume. The particular make of foghorn I had bought worked by a simple mechanism.\
  \ You depressed a knob to turn it on, and depressed the knob again to turn it off.\
  \ Unfortunately I can be a bit of a butterfingers, and when I depressed the knob\
  \ to turn it on, I somehow managed to jam it, so that when I tried to depress it\
  \ again to turn it off, my efforts were in vain. As I said, it was bloody loud,\
  \ and after trying to depress the knob a couple more times, I had to put my hands\
  \ over my ears.\nI stood there, like a fool, at the junction of Ritually Slaughtered\
  \ Poultry Street and Ringo Starr Boulevard, on a clear day when you could see forever.\
  \ And of course, if I could see forever, then so could everybody else, or most of\
  \ them. I wondered if I could pretend that the foghorn was nothing to do with me,\
  \ that I just happened to be passing by when some unseen miscreant depressed its\
  \ knob. But I had the receipt from the foghorn shop in my pocket, and it would certainly\
  \ be found when King Gobbo's secret police bundled me into a van and took me to\
  \ one of their damp dank subterranean interrogation chambers.\nI looked wildly around\
  \ to see if there was a municipal waste bin into which I could chuck the receipt.\
  \ Doing so would involve having to uncover one of my ears for the time it took to\
  \ remove the receipt from my pocket and discard it in the bin, and I might well\
  \ be deaf in that ear forever after, but that seemed my best option if I could accomplish\
  \ it before the arrival of the secret police. But there were no bins to be seen,\
  \ even though it was a clear day and I could see forever.\nThen I remembered King\
  \ Gobbo's latest ukase, proclaimed from his balcony just the other day. Bins were\
  \ banned throughout the land. Bins were only necessary where there was waste, the\
  \ King declared, and in his kingdom nothing went to waste. We were, he said, a frugal\
  \ and ingenious people, who would eke everything, everything!, until it was beyond\
  \ further ekeing, and could be eked no more. Or at least, we had better shape up\
  \ and become that frugal and ingenious people, or else.\nWith my hands over my ears,\
  \ and thinking about that \u201Celse\u201D, and the secret police, and the damp\
  \ dank subterranean interrogation chambers, I decided to make a run for it. I ran\
  \ and ran, until the din of the foghorn was slighly less deafening, I ran and ran\
  \ until I reached the border. It was a very pretty border. I handed myself over\
  \ to the enemy border guards, and begged for mercy. I would think twice before buying\
  \ another foghorn.\n[2016-01-18]"
