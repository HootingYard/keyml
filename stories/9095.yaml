text: "Like absolutely everybody else throughout the land\u2014with the sole exception\
  \ of Nige\u2014I have become enamoured of Scandinavian crime fiction. That is why,\
  \ the other day, I picked up a cheap paperback copy of Headhunters by Jo Nesbo and\
  \ have read about half of it at one sitting. It rattles along. I found myself diverted\
  \ by this passage:\nThe second [thing that caught my attention] was a quotation\
  \ from what are known informally as \u201CPontoppidan's Explanations\u201D in which\
  \ he declares that a person is capable of killing another person's soul, infecting\
  \ it, dragging it down into sin in such a way that redemption is precluded.\nAs\
  \ soon as I felt able to tear myself away from Headhunters, about ninety pages later\u2014\
  I did say it rattles along\u2014I made a cup of tea and devoted myself to discovering\
  \ what I could about Pontoppidan and his Explanations. The first thing I learned\
  \ was that no human being has ever resembled a poodle or a pompom as closely as\
  \ Erik Pontoppidan (1698\u20131764).\n\nIn the Wikipedia, he is listed in the following\
  \ categories: Danish theologians, Danish bishops, Danish ornithologists, Danish\
  \ naturalists, Norwegian bishops, 18th-century Lutheran bishops, People from Aarhus.\
  \ That gives us a reasonably comprehensive picture. As for the Explanations, these\
  \ appear to be one of his most important theological works, a 1737 official state\
  \ church explanation of the Lutheran catechism. One might think that makes for rather\
  \ dry reading, but the part alluded to by Jo Nesbo suggests otherwise. I may have\
  \ to see if there is an English translation available and pore over it for further\
  \ references to murder and infection and sin and eternal damnation.\nAs with so\
  \ many clergymen of the era, Pontoppidan was also an enthusiastic naturalist and\
  \ antiquarian. He compiled, in 1763\u201364, The Danish Atlas, a detailed and ambitious\
  \ description of Denmark based on information gathered from clergy around the country.\
  \ His Natural History of Norway (1752\u20131753), was a description not only of\
  \ the flora and fauna of the country, but also of the peasant population, their\
  \ ways of living and thinking, based upon close observation. It is thanks to Pontoppidan\
  \ that much folkloric material has been preserved.\nAmong his other works were a\
  \ standard Danish hymn book, a guide for vicars to help eradicate superstition and\
  \ reduce devotion to Catholic relics among the peasantry, a four volume history\
  \ of the Danish church, and a collection of epitaphs transcribed from tombstones.\n\
  Of particular interest, at least to me, is that Pontoppidan is one of the earliest\
  \ sources for our knowledge of that ferocious sea monster, the kraken. In the Natural\
  \ History of Norway he gives an extensive description of the beast and makes a number\
  \ of claims, including that the kraken is so enormous it is sometimes mistaken for\
  \ an island, and that the greatest danger to sailors comes not from the creature\
  \ itself but from the mighty whirlpool it leaves in its wake. Not that the kraken\
  \ does not have great destructive power, as Pontoppidan writes \u201CIt is said\
  \ that if [the creature's arms] were to lay hold of the largest man-of-war, they\
  \ would pull it down to the bottom\u201D. The image of the kraken dragging a ship\
  \ down to the bottom of the sea is startlingly similar to the image, in the Explanations,\
  \ of the soul-murderer dragging the infected victim down into sin. One wonders what\
  \ tormented phantasms were going on inside Pontoppidan's head, surrounded by that\
  \ pompom of snow-white hair and the crisp white ruff.\n[This piece is nowhere near\
  \ one thousand words in length, but I think it best to end there, when I have nothing\
  \ more to say, than to expand it needlessly by chuntering on. I could copy out bits\
  \ of Pontoppidanery from the Wikipedia and from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica\
  \ and from the 1914 New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopaedia Of Religious Knowledge (Third\
  \ Edition). I could point out that, weirdly, Erik Pontoppidan has his own Facecloth\
  \ page, which is \u201Cliked\u201D by a total of six people. (I am toying with the\
  \ idea of becoming the seventh.) But, short of immersing myself in certain of the\
  \ texts, I think I have learned enough, and told you enough, about Pontoppidan for\
  \ the time being. It is interesting to me that, just a few hours ago, I had never\
  \ heard of him, and a stray reference led me to find out that little which I have\
  \ found out. Now, when next I am at an elegant and sophisticated cocktail party,\
  \ leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece in my Tyrolean jacket similar to that\
  \ worn by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music, and the conversation turns,\
  \ as it so often does, to the subject of the kraken, I shall be able to pipe up\
  \ with a learned reference to Erik Pontoppidan. Having grabbed the attention of\
  \ the gathering, I can then dazzle my listeners with abstruse points of Scandinavian\
  \ theology and amusing anecdotes of eighteenth century peasant life in Norway. I\
  \ might even throw in a couple of Danish tombstone epitaphs for added entertainment,\
  \ by which time every single person at the cocktail party will be hanging on my\
  \ every word. There is every possibility that, at this point, the cry will go up,\
  \ from one voice or from many, to \u201Cplease, please tell us what Erik Pontoppidan\
  \ looked like, Mr Key!\u201D \u201CWell, those of you foregathered and rapt,\u201D\
  \ I will reply, \u201CIf you have ever seen a poodle, or a white pompom, and imagine\
  \ either of those in human form, then you can summon in your mind's eye a portrait\
  \ of our man.\u201D At which point I might sashay away from the mantelpiece and\
  \ pay a visit to the bathroom, wherein I shall liberally entalc my hair and head\
  \ and collar, and then reappear among the party guests, a striking tableau vivant\
  \ of Erik Pontoppidan. It will then remain for me to select a victim, murder their\
  \ soul, infect it, and drag them down into sin, in such a way that redemption is\
  \ precluded\u2014if, of course, it is that kind of cocktail party.]\n[2012-05-07]"
