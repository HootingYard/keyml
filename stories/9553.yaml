text: "Shortly after his stint on the Country Diary, and his abortive plans for a\
  \ country dairy, Dobson conceived the idea of writing an Urban Diary. By keeping\
  \ his observations to town and city, he reasoned, he would have no need to trespass\
  \ in the countryside and thus run the risk of encountering peasants who, as he put\
  \ it, \u201Cbabble gibberish in the guise of rustic wisdom and so befuddle my brain\u201D\
  . Dobson hawked his idea around a few newspaper and periodical editors, but found\
  \ no takers. Unwilling to abandon the idea, however, he issued what he intended\
  \ would be the first in a lengthy series of pamphlets. This work, Trudges In Towns\
  \ (out of print), has recently been hailed as a pioneering work of psychogeography,\
  \ a judgement which may be based on a misreading of the critic Brent Crude, who\
  \ suggested that \u201Cthere is more psychosis than geography on display in this\
  \ tatty pamphlet\u201D.\nThe title, with its plural Towns, is somewhat misleading,\
  \ as so far as we know Dobson never went further than a single town, Pointy Town,\
  \ in search of material. In fact, unstinting research by hothead young Dobsonist\
  \ Ted Cack suggests that the pamphleteer barely moved from one spot while working\
  \ on the text.\nThis is by no means, writes Cack, the work of a flaneur, nor even\
  \ of a pedestrian. What I have discovered in the course of my unstinting research\
  \ is that Dobson barely moved from his escritoire while writing Trudges In Towns.\
  \ He might have popped into the kitchen to boil some water in a kettle preparatory\
  \ to pouring it into a teapot into which he had already spooned, from a caddy, a\
  \ modicum of tea leaves, and he may have remained in the kitchen, staring vacantly\
  \ out of the window, at crows or cows or trees or whatever it was that was visible\
  \ outside his window at that time, while he waited for the tea leaves to infuse\
  \ the hot water, and he would still have been in the kitchen, away from his escritoire\
  \ when, eventually, he rested a tea-strainer over his cup and poured tea through\
  \ it from the teapot, into the cup, before adding a dash of milk, poured delicately\
  \ from a bottle taken from the refrigerator, also located in the kitchen, and, making\
  \ use of a teaspoon from the cutlery drawer, stirred the decoction so that milk\
  \ and tea-infused water were throroughly and inextricably intermingled, and he would\
  \ only return to his escritoire and get some bloody scribbling done when, having\
  \ placed the cup of tea atop a saucer, he carried it out of the kitchen, before\
  \ which he would have ensured that the tea-strainer and the teaspoon had been rinsed\
  \ under the tap and placed for the time being on the draining board anent the sink,\
  \ there to dry in the warm fug of kitcheny air. But that was about as far away from\
  \ his escritoire as he got. There is no evidence that he ever trudged the streets\
  \ of Pointy Town, alert to the sights and sounds and smells of what Keith Pratt,\
  \ husband of the toyshop assistant Candice-Marie Pratt, famously termed \u201Cthe\
  \ hurly burly of the urban conurbation\u201D. I forgot to mention, by the way, that\
  \ before rinsing the tea-strainer under the tap in the sink, Dobson would have deposited\
  \ the tea leaves caught in the strainer into a waste bin in the kitchen, one with\
  \ a flip top lid, a lid raised and lowered by depressing a pedal at the exterior\
  \ base of the bin with the sole of his foot. Some might accuse me of wittering away\
  \ with far too much detail about the inconsequentialities of Dobson's doings, but\
  \ in my view it is the duty of a biographer to act as a conjuror who makes his subjects\
  \ \u201Cwalk and appear that have layen in their graves many hundreds of years\u201D\
  , as John Aubrey put it. And, yes, I am well aware that Dobson has not been dead\
  \ that long, but I am writing for posterity, even if I am writing a short article\
  \ for a tatty magazine rather than a big fat biography.\nTed Cack need not justify\
  \ his methods to me. I am always delighted to read even the most trivial prattle\
  \ about the twentieth century's titanic out of print pamphleteer. In fact, I would\
  \ be spellbound by an account of his making of coffee, or cocoa, or his boiling\
  \ of potatoes, or his chopping of carrots, or a myriad of other activities, those\
  \ performed in the kitchen and elsewhere. Each fragmentary glimpse of Dobson contributes\
  \ to our portrait of the man, in all his Dobsonosity. Quite frankly, I don't care\
  \ if all that stuff he wrote in his Urban Diary was mere figment, embroidered from\
  \ the stuffing of his brain, rather than based on direct observation of whatever\
  \ was going on in Pointy Town at the time.\nBut what, precisely, was that stuff?\
  \ And why did not a single newspaper or periodical editor show the slightest interest\
  \ in it? After the initial rejections, Dobson thought that by issuing the pamphlet\
  \ as a kind of sampler, and sending copies to editors, he would have them fighting\
  \ tooth and claw, bidding ever more ridiculous sums of money, to engage him as a\
  \ regular urban diarist. In the event, the tatty pamphlets were chucked, unread,\
  \ into bins, much like the tea leaves from Dobson's tea strainer. Trudges In Towns\
  \ was meant to be the first in a series, but no subsequent pamphlets were ever written,\
  \ and it stands alone and isolated in the Dobson canon.\nThe problem, I think\u2014\
  and Ted Cack agrees with me\u2014is that the day Dobson chose to write about for\
  \ his first Urban Diary happened to be a day on which all the countryside persons\
  \ for miles around descended upon Pointy Town en masse, with their carts and horses\
  \ and hay and straw and turnips and potatoes and shapeless hats and smocks and muck\
  \ and slurry and what have you. Even if the pamphleteer had roamed further than\
  \ his kitchen, in the streets and alleys and mews of Pointy Town he would have met\
  \ with nobody but peasants, wide-eyed and dribbling and, of course, babbling gibberish\
  \ in the guise of rustic wisdom and so befuddling Dobson's brain.\nIt is his very\
  \ befuddlement that is expressed in the text, which makes no sense whatsoever, and\
  \ is largely unreadable. Even young hothead Ted Cack doesn't understand it, nor\
  \ even claim to, and that is saying something.\nA new edition of Trudges In Towns,\
  \ in which all the original words are crossed out and replaced by others, from opposite\
  \ ends of the dictionary, is currently in preparation. Ted Cack is writing an extremely\
  \ lengthy foreword, in which he promises to examine in detail Dobson's habitual\
  \ method of tying his bootlaces in the first week of March 1954.\n[2012-06-30]"
