text: "I have been commissioned to write the Life of the balletomane Nan Kew. I'll\
  \ say it again. I have been commissioned to write the Life of Nan Kew, the balletomane.\
  \ Now, never having written a Life before, I don't know what to do. I have no idea\
  \ how to set this Life in train. I only know one thing about Nan Kew for certain,\
  \ and that is that her eyes were blue.\nI have been advised by a tiptop biographer\
  \ of many persons of the past that I will have to talk to people she knew. But apparently,\
  \ nearly all her surviving pals live abroad, in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Spain.\
  \ Some are even as far flung as Peru. I do not even own a passport, as I have always\
  \ found travel to be an unbearable strain. I am reluctant even to travel by train.\
  \ Call me unadventurous, but I stick to my familiar surroundings like glue. I would\
  \ much rather sit fast than board one of those gigantic lumps of metal they call\
  \ an aeroplane.\nAn added problem is that everything I have written to date has\
  \ been fiction, but of course every last detail of this Life has to be true. That\
  \ much is plain. She had, though, a very long life, so there are many facts upon\
  \ which to chew. After doing a bit of research, I can add, to the colour of her\
  \ eyes, that she was a Jew. And that she had a pet dog, a Great Dane. Other than\
  \ that, so far, I haven't got a clue.\nIt would help if I knew something about the\
  \ ballet, too. But nothing bores me to tears as much as a prancing ninny in a tutu.\
  \ If you buy a ticket for the ballet you may as well pour your money down the drain.\
  \ That's my view. The sole reason I agreed to write this Life was the prospect of\
  \ financial gain. I accepted an advance, so I suppose that if I don't produce a\
  \ manuscript the publishers will sue. That would be a pain.\nLast time I was threatened\
  \ with legal action I spent six months hiding in a zoo. Granted, as a solution to\
  \ my problems it was not entirely sane. I pretended to be a veterinary surgeon,\
  \ there to care for a pregnant gnu. One day my cover was blown and I saw some coppers\
  \ approach and I ran off down a lane. Just my luck, I was set upon by a ruffian\
  \ crew. Their bashings to my head did something untoward to my poor poor brain.\n\
  That was not the end of my worries, because after that I caught the flu. And I had\
  \ a migraine. And I had a stone in my shoe. And then I was drenched by rain. Somehow\
  \ I managed to hobble into a church where I collapsed on to a pew. I let out a little\
  \ gasp of relief: \u201CPhew\u201D Too soon, for then I noticed that in my collapse\
  \ I had cut myself and blood was pouring from a vein. I rummaged in my pocket for\
  \ a jar of wound-soothing goo. It was an ointment containing linseed and mugwort\
  \ and feverfew. Oh, and with a smidgen of henbane. As I smeared the wound, I heard\
  \ the uncanny rattling of a chain. Trust my luck, or lack of it, to have taken shelter\
  \ in a church that had been deconsecrated and was now used for purposes new. In\
  \ this case, the rehearsal of a ballet, King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring\
  \ Systems, Its Janitor And Its Chatelaine.\nI could not help wondering if it was\
  \ a ballet Nan Kew had seen and favoured with a review. For at some point within\
  \ all the legal shenanigans and hiding out I had discovered something else about\
  \ the balletomane. That she wrote a column for a ballet journal, and the more she\
  \ wrote the more her reputation grew. I had found in an archive a bound copy of\
  \ this journal and had a read-through. God it was boring, I won't do that again.\
  \ She communicated her enthusiasm for the ballet with a lot of verbal pyrotechnics\
  \ and ballyhoo. And it seemed to me she stuck to received wisdom, there was nothing\
  \ she wrote that went against the grain. Not that I know anything about ballet,\
  \ that's true. But it occurred to me that if I was going to write this Life, now\
  \ I knew from where to take my cue. I could bulk it out with quotes from Nan, and\
  \ who would spot them, I mean, who? In the unlikely event that some ballet nutter\
  \ did, I was sure I could think up a way to explain. And a combination of plagiarism\
  \ and controversy could prove a heady brew. At least, from the publisher's point\
  \ of view. Who knows what a huge amount of sales my Life might attain? I might even\
  \ earn back the advance that was my due. I envisioned the launch of the Life, and\
  \ outside the bookshop an enormous queue.\nMy attention suddenly reverted to the\
  \ ballet rehearsal in the deconsecrated church, where they were trying out an exciting\
  \ scene in which King Jasper is slain. So complicated is the choreography that one\
  \ cannot tell if he is killed by the janitor or the chatelaine. I am more used to\
  \ pantomime, so when the culprit was revealed I gave a great hiss and a boo. At\
  \ which point the ballet dancers withdrew. Fool that I am, my hiss and boo had revealed\
  \ my presence to the ruffian crew. They came crashing through the church door, armed\
  \ to the teeth, demented and insane. But hot on their heels came the coppers, so\
  \ fast they almost flew. In the confusion and brouhaha I managed to flee, but my\
  \ flight proved to be just another turn of the screw. I ran slap bang into the side\
  \ of a huge metal crane.\nI was taken to a clinic where clinicians prodded my brain.\
  \ When I woke up, they said \u201CWe have some news for you\u201D. I wondered if\
  \ they were going to tell me I'd gone cuckoo. And that, in so many words, was true.\
  \ They said, \u201CYou have a derangement of the brain. You are in no fit state\
  \ to write the Life of Nan Kew, the balletomane.\u201D As if to prove their point,\
  \ I asked \u201CWho?\u201D They said \u201CThe balletomane, Nan Kew\u201D.\n[2012-03-27]"
