text: "So baffled were the police by the teeming ramifications of the Inspip case\
  \ that they had no idea what to do, until a dejected inspector threw in the towel\
  \ and suggested, reluctantly, that they call in Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
  \ in hope that he might hack a clearing through their mental forest, to which Tarleton's\
  \ response, upon receipt of the coppers\u2019 telegram, was to instruct his helpmeet,\
  \ the dwarf Crepusco, to pay them a visit and pull one of his faces at them, to\
  \ which Crepusco's response was \u201CAre you sure?\u201D, said in a trembling voice,\
  \ for he was all too aware that when he pulled one of his faces the effect on those\
  \ who saw it was akin to something from a story by H P Lovecraft, reducing the witness\
  \ to a horror-stricken gibbering wreck, fit only to be chained up in an asylum for\
  \ the incurably insane for the rest of their days, but Tarleton insisted, telling\
  \ Crepusco to pull face number forty-three, expressive of fathomless and bitter\
  \ contempt, so the dwarf toddled off along the lane towards the police station,\
  \ and on his way encountered, as chance would have it, one of the teeming ramifications\
  \ of the Inspip case, in that, not too far along the way, he tripped and toppled\
  \ into the bottomless viper-pit of Shoeburyness, and was mightily surprised, after\
  \ falling just a few feet, to land with a crunch upon a false bottom in the viper-pit,\
  \ a platform installed by unknown hand, possibly but not definitively Inspip's,\
  \ the crunchy nature of his landing caused by the bescatterment, upon the platform,\
  \ of eggshells in great abundance, with no sign whatsoever of the eggs\u2019 innards,\
  \ the albumen and yellow yolk and whatever else an egg expert might descry inside\
  \ an egg, there were just the shells, upon which Crepusco landed, crunchily, before\
  \ sitting up and rubbing his bonce and wondering why he had not continued to fall,\
  \ forever and ever, as ought surely to have been his fate, the viper-pit of Shoeburyness,\
  \ like that of Gaar, and several others, being notorious for being bottomless, according\
  \ to the guidebooks and gazetteers available from the souvenir kiosk located at\
  \ one end of a sort of modern-day ley line, along which magnets ceased to function\
  \ and clumps of vetch and bindweed withered, at the other end of which stood, surrounded\
  \ by an imposing fence fitted with floodlights, the police station, wherein the\
  \ frazzled coppers were still awaiting a response from Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
  \ and busying themselves meanwhile by rummaging, for the umperumpteenth time, through\
  \ their miles of filing cabinets in which every last scrap of information regarding\
  \ the Inspip case was kept, from that very first report of an eye-witness, a preternaturally\
  \ alert passer-by, who had tested negative for hallucinogens, thrice, and who had\
  \ brought, breathlessly, panting, panting, to the coppers\u2019 attention the curious\
  \ circumstance that in Scroonhoonpooge Model Village, the aviary, behind the milk\
  \ factory, was life-size, and filled with real birds, such that they would appear\
  \ enormous and monstrous to the tiny little figures populating the model village,\
  \ and their caws and chirps and chirrups and trills deafeningly loud, and that this\
  \ anomaly was just the kind of thing Inspip would clap his hands with glee over,\
  \ though try as they might not a single officer could say with any certainty, hand\
  \ on heart, that Inspip had form in the area, nor indeed that he even knew where\
  \ the Scroonhoonpooge Model Village was, given that all reported sightings of him\
  \ for the past two decades placed him elsewhere, and he had been banned from consulting\
  \ maps and atlases for even longer than that, ever since the Botched Shadow Puppetry\
  \ case, when he was, albeit briefly, in cahoots, or \u201Cup to his eyeballs\u201D\
  \ as Detective Captain Cargpan put it, with Babinsky, the lumbering walrus-moustached\
  \ psychopathic serial killer, an alliance that was mercifully short-lived, thanks\
  \ to Cargpan, the very same Cargpan who, now, rummaging in one of the filing cabinets,\
  \ chanced upon a tattered black-and-white snapshot of an unidentified acrobat performing\
  \ an unidentified feat of acrobatics which would have seemed physically impossible\
  \ were it not for the photographic evidence, and on a whim, or accident, the detective\
  \ captain looked at the snapshot from a geometrically unlikely angle, and saw suddenly\
  \ what nobody else had seen before, himself included, which was that, in her poise\
  \ and turpsiletto, the acrobat seemed to be personating the exact lineaments of\
  \ the stick-figure in the corner of an emblem on the flag of a secret society the\
  \ doings, or misdoings, of which had ravaged several important colonial outposts\
  \ and not a few unimportant ones at the tail end of the war, one of the wars, and\
  \ which had long been thought consigned to the dustbin of history but which, Cargpan\
  \ now realised, with a Lovecraftian shudder, could indeed still be active, and engaged\
  \ in nefarious shenanigans, here and now, and particularly in the model village\
  \ at Scroonhoonpooge, and he grabbed a butcher's pencil and began scribbling frenziedly\
  \ in his coppers\u2019 jotting pad, and then he rummaged in some of the other filing\
  \ cabinets, and tore some of his hair out, until he jumped up on to a desk in the\
  \ middle of the situation room, gaining the immediate and rapt attention of all\
  \ the other coppers, to whom he cried, ear-piercingly, \u201CWhere are the eggs?\
  \ Where are the eggs?\u201D, and they all knew at once he was referring to the various\
  \ birds\u2019 eggs laid by the anomalously life-size birds in the aviary of the\
  \ model village, and, gosh, this is exciting, at that very moment Crepusco the dwarf,\
  \ who had managed to clamber out of the temporarily non-bottomless viper-pit of\
  \ Shoeburyness, came blundering into the room, dozens of bits of eggshell clinging\
  \ to his clothing, and he was about to pull his fathomless and bitter contempt face,\
  \ number forty-three, when a sixth sense stopped him, seeing the blazing eyes of\
  \ Detective Captain Cargpan and all the other coppers gazing at him with an unmistakeable\
  \ gleam of dawning understanding and clarity, as when pennies drop from heaven,\
  \ every time it rains, and the clouds burst and it was raining now, as it always\
  \ rains on the feast day of St Bibblybibdib, for yes!, this all happened on St Bibblybibdib's\
  \ Day, which is why it is significant, and why I have told you about it, for had\
  \ it happened on any other day in the calendar year it would hardly be worth mentioning,\
  \ and it would have remained one of those untold stories of Tarleton, the amateur's\
  \ amateur, untold and unknown, never collected in any of the many volumes devoted\
  \ to his doings, all of which, like the pamphlets of the pamphleteer Dobson, are\
  \ out of print.\n[2017-11-14]"
