text: "In days of yore, when I was young, I tried my hand at verse rather than prose.\
  \ This was not a good idea. I do not have a poet's sensibility, although I am not\
  \ entirely sure what that means. I recall with fondness a handful of the verses\
  \ I wrote. There was one in particular, in which I alleged that I was sitting in\
  \ a room with massive shutters and had brilliantine in my hair, that nudges at my\
  \ memory. Thirty years or more have passed since I wrote it. If I recall correctly,\
  \ I was sitting in a room with massive shutters, and I did have brilliantine in\
  \ my hair. But of course my recollections are all askew. I barely recall last week,\
  \ let alone the early years of the Thatcher administration. It may be that the debaucheries\
  \ of my Wilderness Years frazzled certain circuitry in my bonce. That would account\
  \ for my imperfect memory.\nYet I know there were a few occasions when I slathered\
  \ my hair in brilliantine, though I am no longer clear why I did so. One such occasion\
  \ was New Year's Day 1980, which I spent in a holiday cottage on the south coast\
  \ owned by the parents of a friend of mine. This friend was a big-brained intellectual\
  \ with an alarmingly high-pitched voice who went on to become a successful television\
  \ producer of mindless tat. Even at that young age, he did not have enough hair\
  \ on his head to slather it with brilliantine. He was prematurely bald. But I was\
  \ not, and I had brilliantine in my hair.\nWere there massive shutters in that holiday\
  \ cottage? I do not remember any, but then I have never had much of a mind for architecture.\
  \ This is a failing, akin to my failure as a poet, but I lose no sleep over it.\
  \ I do not dream of a parallel world in which I roam through buildings spouting\
  \ expert knowledge of them in rhyming couplets. Perhaps I would be a better person\
  \ if I did. But I doubt it.\nIt has suddenly occurred to me that I posted that poem\
  \ at Hooting Yard ten years ago. I mistakenly attributed it, then, to Dobson,\n\
  There were massive shutters in that room, and I had never left it. Ah, I had brilliantine\
  \ in my hair. There were roses, there were lockets, I was lacking something, so\
  \ unnerved\u2014but for my hatred she\u2019d\u2019ve seen it, even eaten it, got\
  \ it on her eyelash, crushed it, broken it, eked it out of someone's purse or loved\
  \ it, lusted after it. So here's my signifier\u2014you can read it, you can keep\
  \ it. You're so fucking thick you don't even know what to do with it. Well \u2026\
  \ eyebrows, hair, my pastels, then breakfast and a lover. Oh come on, you must be\
  \ guessing. Or maybe you're just so fetching. I'm done with fleshing out my lying.\
  \ My hair is in a tangle and I haven't paid the rent. But I had brilliantine in\
  \ my hair, and yours were better shutters. Damn it, I couldn't even see your rubbish,\
  \ but I had brilliantine in my hair.\nWhat is all that about, apart from shutters\
  \ and brilliantine? It sounds peevish to me. I note that, ten years ago, typing\
  \ it out, I typed it as prose rather than verse. It makes little or no difference.\
  \ Either way, it is a fragment of the past, of a different time, when I stood on\
  \ a south coast beach on New Year's Day and posed for a photograph, black and white,\
  \ remembered but lost, with brilliantine in my hair.\n[2014-12-09]"
