text: 'It has come to my attention that a bishop, when dying, is compelled by law
  to bequeath his pack of dogs to the reigning monarch, for the sovereign''s free
  use and disposal.

  Perhaps there is a legal expert among my readers who could confirm whether or no
  this sensible measure remains on the statute book. And if it does, I would be interested
  to know if it is possible to pursue, beyond the grave, any bishop who, before his
  last gasp, broke the law by not so bequeathing his pack of dogs. It seems to me
  that a prelate who sinned by breaking the law, even in his last extremity, ought
  to be pitched from his heavenly perch into the maw of hell.
