  \ dunking. The thing about a Rich Tea biscuit, he thought, was that it had the consistency\
  \ of cardboard and tasted of nothing. Dunked, it had the consistency of hot wet\
  \ cardboard and still tasted of nothing. Of a sudden, with uncharacteristic impetuosity,\
  \ he flung the biscuit across the room, where it clattered against the wainscot\
  \ and broke into smithereens. Did he but know it, the aged grandee had, at the eleventh\
