text: "Some writers are so damned original that they create their own genre. This\
  \ is true even of certain pulp writers, such as the American scribbler Brent Crude,\
  \ who was born on this day in 1882. After knocking out short stories at a prodigious\
  \ rate for magazines such as Amazing Yarns, Astonishing Yarns, and Breathtaking\
  \ Yarns, in 1922 Crude published his first full-length novel. Flapper In An Airship\
  \ introduced readers to his heroine the flapper in an airship, and thus was born\
  \ the entire flapper-in-an-airship genre.\nOver the following two decades, dozens\
  \ of hacks bashed out novels about flappers in airships, but none could match Brent\
  \ Crude's industry, nor indeed his ability to devise page-turning pot-boilers about\
  \ flappers in airships. By the time of his death in 1941, it is thought he had written\
  \ over fifty novels featuring the flapper in an airship.\nInterestingly, Brent Crude\
  \ was an exact contemporary, 1882 to 1941, of both James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.\
  \ If he is little read today, it is probably because both flappers and airships\
  \ have fallen out of fashion. I think, however, he is due for a revival. This is\
  \ not a view shared by the literary critic Prig Blot, one of the few people who\
  \ has read all of Crude's work (or at least claims to have done so).\n\u201CThese\
  \ so-called flapper in an airship novels,\u201D he contends, \u201Care all much\
  \ of a muchness, Careful analysis of the texts, as carried out by me in my Scandinavian\
  \ ivory tower overlooking the fjords and glaciers of my homeland, demonstrates conclusively\
  \ that Brent Crude simply shuffled about the same sentences and paragraphs of his\
  \ first novel, over and over again, occasionally inserting a different adjective\
  \ here and there. I have wasted ten years of my life reading and rereading and rerereading\
  \ these foolish books, years I can never regain, and my soul is corroded, and all\
  \ I am good for now is to eke out what time is left to me chewing salted fish and\
  \ sobbing into my Scandinavian napkin.\u201D\nAll of Brent Crude's books are currently\
  \ out of print.\n[2015-12-14]"
