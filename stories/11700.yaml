  Ronald Knox, found awake aged four by a nanny, was asked what he was thinking about,\
  \ and he replied \u201Cthe past\u201D.\nA remark with a similar weight of world-weariness\
  \ was made by my eldest son, when he was but a tot. Having contracted some sort\
  \ of stomach bug, he vomited. As we mopped his fevered brow, he wailed \u201COh,\
  \ why can't I have a happy life?\u201D\n[2013-07-12]"
