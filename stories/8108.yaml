text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I get misty-eyed and nostalgic about something or\
  \ other. What I might be misty-eyed and nostalgic about is the fact that the piece\
  \ was written over a quarter of a century ago, which is a somewhat unnerving thought.\
  \ I did not know then what the piece was \u201Cabout\u201D, and in the succeeding\
  \ twenty-five years I have come no closer to grasping the world-shuddering significance\
  \ lurking within its two hundred and twenty-two words. But world-shuddering significance\
  \ there is, of that we can be sure. Do let me know if you can work out what it is,\
  \ because I still haven't got a clue.\nADDENDUM\_: I have changed two of those two\
  \ hundred and twenty-two words for this twenty-first century version, but the meaning,\
  \ whatever it might be, is not altered in any dramatic, or even undramatic, manner.\n\
