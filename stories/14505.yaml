text: "Gunner Pitkin found himself stranded behind enemy lines.\n  He hid in a barn.\n\
  \  There was a cow in the barn.\n  It was an enemy cow.\n  Back in the field tent,\
  \ Gunner Pitkin had had dinned into his head, by the captain, where his duty lay.\n\
  \  It was an enemy cow, so he had to kill it.\n  Gunner Pitkin was not the brightest\
  \ of men, but he realised that if he used his gun to shoot the cow, the noise of\
  \ the report could alert the enemy to his presence in the barn.\n  Back in the field\
  \ tent, Gunner Pitkin had had dinned into his head, by the captain, that part of\
  \ his duty was to avoid capture at all costs.\n  Gunner Pitkin looked wildly around\
  \ the barn, seeking an instrument by which he might bring about the death of the\
  \ enemy cow, but silently.\n  He saw a churn and a hoe and a spade.\n  Gunner Pitkin\
  \ put down his gun and picked up the spade.\n  He approached the cow.\n  Gunner\
  \ Pitkin hoisted the spade high, ready to bring it bashing down repeatedly and relentlessly\
  \ upon the cow's head.\n  Then it occurred to him that there lives the dearest freshness\
  \ deep down things, even cows, even enemy cows.\n  He put the spade down.\n  Gunner\
  \ Pitkin lay upon a bale of straw and fell asleep.\n  Several hours later he was\
  \ captured by the enemy.\n  In the prisoner of war camp, Gunner Pitkin occupied\
  \ his time making toy cows out of balsa wood and dough.\n  By the time the peace\
  \ was signed on Luneburg Heath, he had made hundreds of toy cows.\n  They can now\
  \ be found in a museum, a converted barn in a daffodil-splattered field that used\
  \ to be behind enemy lines.\n[2016-01-25]"
