text: "\u201CTrue confession:\_ I have had two library clown traumas in my career.\u201D\
  \u2014Mary, at Awful Library Books.\nMary clearly did not work at the Pointy Town\
  \ Municipal Library during the 1950s, or she would have had many more such traumas.\
  \ Between 1952 and 1958, the library was staffed entirely by frightful clowns in\
  \ full traditional clown costume, as part of a \u201Csocial engineering experiment\u201D\
  \ conducted by the Bl\xF6tzmannite head librarian, one Barb Crutch. She never made\
  \ clear the purpose of her scheme, nor indeed its results. She died in the Munich\
  \ Air Disaster, puzzlingly, for no one ever discovered what connection she had with\
  \ the Busby Babes, and her replacement as head librarian quietly dropped the clown\
  \ business. One Tuesday morning in March 1958, she tricked all the staff into thinking\
  \ they were going on a charabanc outing, and once they were all aboard, she persuaded\
  \ the driver to take them to a big top erected on a piece of land reserved for government\
  \ nerve gas tests. So ended the reign of clowns at Pointy Town Municipal Library.\n\
