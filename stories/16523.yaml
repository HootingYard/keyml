text: 'Pity me, O people of Switzerland. I am a Swiss soldier, and I languish in a
  Swiss dungeon, under sentence of death. My crime? I sang, in a public square, the
  milking-song Khue-Reyen. And thus I was condemned. I broke the law, and now I must
  pay the price.

  For comfort, in my cold Swiss subterranean cell, I clutch to my cheek the Bib of
  St Bibblybibdib. There is a story to tell of how this sacred relic came into my
  possession. It is not a particularly arresting story, but I will tell it anyway,
  to pass the time before I am dragged from my dungeon to the gibbet, and hanged by
  the neck until I am justly dead.

  There were a half-dozen of us, six Swiss soldiers, camped on a hill above a Swiss
  village. Our orders were to await the dawn and then to charge, screaming, down to
  the village and to lay it waste. Doing so, we were told, would bring us one step
  closer to victory over our foe.

  And so we charged, and so we screamed, and so we laid waste. And among the buildings
  to which we laid waste was the village church. And in the sacristy of this church
  was kept, in a bejewelled casket, the Bib of St Bibblybibdib.

  Was it the real Bib, or was it one of the dozens, even hundreds, of counterfeit
  bibs thought to be held in parishes throughout the cantons of Switzerland? We did
  not know. We were rough tough Swiss soldiers, not men of God. That is why, in deciding
  which of us should carry off the Bib as his war prize, we cleared the surface of
  the altar in the village church of its holy bric-a-brac, and played a game of cards
  upon it. We played My Lady''s Pudding under knock-out rules, and I was the last
  Swiss soldier standing.

  And so I was given first dibs on St Bibblybibdib''s bib.

  I will carry it with me to the place of Swiss execution, if they will let me. Whether
  they do or do not, at this hour of my death, pity me, people of Switzerland.
