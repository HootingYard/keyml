text: "A letter plops on to the mat, signed\u2014with a flourish\u2014by someone who\
  \ wishes to be known only as \u201CProcessed Cheese Enthusiast\u201D.\nDear Mr Key,\
  \ it reads, You are rightly regarded as a fount of all wisdom and an acknowledged\
  \ authority on just about any subject one can shake a stick at. At least, that is\
  \ what I have been told, by an acquaintance of mine. Well, not an acquaintance,\
  \ exactly, rather a fellow I bumped into on a canal towpath when I was out walking\
  \ my dog. It's not a real dog, more of an imaginary one, made out of paper like\
  \ the adopted children of Arthur Cravan and Mina Loy, but by god it's a faithful\
  \ hound. Anyway, the point is that I wasn't looking where I was going and I collided\
  \ with this chap, who bore a striking resemblance to one of the figures on the periphery\
  \ of a Pi\xE8ta painted by one of the Renaissance painters, though I can't remember\
  \ which one. Following our collision, he toppled into the canal, and after I pulled\
  \ him back on to the path we fell into conversation. At first this mainly consisted\
  \ of recriminations and dark threats of violence, but things soon settled down and\
  \ we strolled amicably along chattering away like a couple of chattering birds.\
  \ I would give you the name of the birds, but I know nothing of ornithology.\nBefore\
  \ we parted, near a telephone kiosk, the man mentioned, out of the blue, that you\
  \ are rightly regarded as a fount of all wisdom and an acknowledged authority on\
  \ just about any subject one can shake a stick at. I wondered for a moment if he\
  \ had taken leave of his senses, so I rattled off the standard questions\u2014what\
  \ year is this?, who is the current Prime Minister?, how much is that doggie in\
  \ the window?\u2014and he seemed compos mentis. I made a note of your name in my\
  \ pocketbook, for future reference.\nThe future has now arrived. When I sprang out\
  \ of bed this morning, I had a burning question in my head, to which I did not know\
  \ the answer. As I shovelled my breakfast down my gob, I recalled my encounter with\
  \ the man on the canal towpath, and that he had recommended you as a peerless source\
  \ of information on everything under the sun. So as soon as I had completed my post-breakfast\
  \ digestive exercises, I rummaged about in the various pockets of my various jackets\
  \ until I found the pocketbook in which I had written down your name. Now you will\
  \ be agog wondering what it is I wish to ask you.\nWell, Mr Key, it is this. As\
  \ you know everything there is to know, I can safely assume that you are familiar\
  \ with the Laughing Cow brand of processed cheese triangles, of which I am a great\
  \ enthusiast. Just in case, I have enclosed with this letter a sample of packaging.\n\
  \nYou will note that the cow on the Laughing Cow container is indeed laughing. You\
  \ will also note, though it is not strictly relevant, that the cow is sporting a\
  \ pair of earrings which, unlikely as it seems, are formed of a couple of packets\
  \ of Laughing Cow processed cheese triangles. That is not something you see every\
  \ day, is it? The question that has been raging in my brain since I woke up this\
  \ morning is this: what is the cow laughing at? I feel sure you will know the answer,\
  \ because the man on the canal towpath who I accidentally knocked into the canal\
  \ told me that you know pretty much everything about everything and willingly share\
  \ your knowledge with anybody. So please put me out of my misery and for God's sake\
  \ enlighten me. What is it that so amuses the cow?\nI shall be replying privately\
  \ to \u201CProcessed Cheese Enthusiast\u201D shortly. If any other readers have\
  \ queries about cow-related matters, or indeed cow-unrelated matters, please feel\
  \ free to drop me a line.\n[2015-12-17]"
