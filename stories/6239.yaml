text: "One dreary morning I went walking along the perimeter of the owl sanctuary,\
  \ past the decoy duckpond, beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before\
  \ the level crossing, and on to Blister Lane. The drizzle ceased, and through a\
  \ sudden gap in the clouds a shaft of sunlight beamed down upon the paving slabs\
  \ and the gutter, and I saw something glisten. Though still some yards away, I have\
  \ piercing eyesight, and I saw it was a tack, a tack glinting in the light. I wondered\
  \ if perhaps it had been discarded by an ironmonger or handyperson, deliberately,\
  \ because it was an imperfect tack, or accidentally, through carelessness or stupidity\
  \ or worse. When I reached the point on the paving alongside the gutter in which\
  \ the tack had been abandoned, I stopped still. Looking at it, from my freakish\
  \ height of six-foot-nine, I immediately knew it was made of brass. I am not a professional\
  \ metallurgist, but over the course of my long life I have trained myself to identify\
  \ any number of metals by sight, a skill which has proved useful in situations as\
  \ diverse as quiz shows, cocktail parties, and mining disasters. Clouds shifted,\
  \ the shaft of sunlight vanished, and the tack no longer gleamed. But there I was,\
  \ standing over it, so what choice did I have? I got down to it. I do not mean that\
  \ I \u201Cgot down\u201D in a groovy sort of way, daddy-o, as a soul singer might\
  \ \u201Cget down\u201D. No, I simply went down on my hands and knees, on the paving\
  \ slabs, and then got down further, sprawling, as it were, flat upon the slabs,\
  \ so that my body lay across Blister Lane while my head, and thus my eyes, were\
  \ directly above the brass tack.\nI was disporting myself thus, keenly eyeing the\
  \ brass tack, when I heard footsteps approaching. I did not wish to block the path,\
  \ so I sat up, and as I did so I popped the tack into my pocket. In spite of my\
  \ civic-minded physical manoeuvering, the footstepper did not continue wending his\
  \ way, but stopped short, looming above me.\n\u201CAre you alright?\u201D he asked.\n\
  He was a thick-set fellow, head like a potato, and he was dressed in the dust \u2018\
  n\u2019 muck-covered overalls of a labouring man. It occurred to me he might be\
  \ the owner of the tack, out hunting for it.\n\u201CI am fine, thank you,\u201D\
  \ I said, from my sitting position, \u201CI was just getting down to brass tack.\
  \ It is now in my pocket. Does it belong to you, by any chance?\u201D\n\u201CNo,\u201D\
  \ he replied, \u201CIn my line of work I have no need for tacks. I am a paviour,\u201D\
  \ he added, \u201CAnd I laid every paving slab for as far as the eye can see, including\
  \ the one you are sitting on.\u201D\n\u201COh, I'm sorry,\u201D I said, getting\
  \ to my feet.\n\u201CNot to worry,\u201D said the paviour, \u201CWell, now I have\
  \ ascertained that you are not an invalid or otherwise incapacitated, I shall be\
  \ on my way. I have paving to attend to elsewhere.\u201D\n\u201COf course,\u201D\
  \ I said, doffing my Homburg.\nI went home and put the brass tack on the kitchenette\
  \ floor, where I could in future get down to it at my leisure. Some authorities\u2014\
  Blodgett, for example\u2014insist that one must have more than one brass tack to\
  \ get down to, plural tacks, as it were, but such a hidebound view cuts no mustard\
  \ with me. I know my onions.\n[2011-03-19]"
