text: "Blodwyn was une merveilleuse. She had an orange head. She played spinet with\
  \ great \xE9lan the day before she wed. She married a man called Fulgenceac, one\
  \ of les incroyables. His nose was as the beak of a crow, and he soon lost his marbles.\n\
  Blodwyn hired a rowing boat and plied it \u2018cross the lake. She gathered herbs\
  \ and flowers an infusion for to make. \u201CThis will set your brain to rights,\
  \ do drink it, Fulgenceac,\u201D she said when she re-rowed the lake, as soon as\
  \ she got back.\nBut there was rotten ergot in her bubbling hot tisane, so when\
  \ her husband drank it he went permanently insane. Blodwyn had to chain him up in\
  \ the attic of their chateau, and ever after all her days were filled with grief\
  \ and woe.\nIf this story has a moral, it is one I have forgot. Just be very wary\
  \ of contaminated ergot.\n[2010-01-14]"
