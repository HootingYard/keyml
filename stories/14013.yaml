text: "Dear Mr. Key,, writes Poppy Nisbet from her fastness in North America, There\
  \ was an offer on Freecycle this morning for a \u201Cdisabled rooster\u201D. I haven't\
  \ been able to get it out of my mind. It read: \u201COffer: disabled rooster\u201D\
  .\nLikewise, on the bird front, I found a wonderful 17th century engraving of two\
  \ standing desert ostriches blowing on their eggs. After dogged persistence Google\
  \ finally produced a translation of the accompanying Latin text and I learned that\
  \ ostriches were believed to leave their eggs to hatch in the care of the sun and\
  \ the sand. The parent birds blew \u201Cnourishing breathe\u201D onto their offspring\
  \ before, er, deserting them.\nThe translation given for ostrich was \u201CSparrow-camel\u201D\
