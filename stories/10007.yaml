text: 'A couple of snaps of Volleyball, Tar & Shuddering, a 1989 work by Mr Key. It
  consists of a set of fifteen cards each bearing a colour illustration and a scribbled
  text (plus two endpapers, or, I suppose, endcards). I cannot recall how many copies
  were issued, but its rarity value is such that it can fetch as much as 35p at today''s
  prices.
