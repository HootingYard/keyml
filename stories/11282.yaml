  \ be brought into existence. What I do not mention in the piece is Hooting Yard\
  \ Earth, an important new interweb-based initiative over which boffins are currently\
  \ slaving in their remote subterranean Alpine fastness. Details are sketchy, but\
  \ apparently they think they have nearly completed work on an app which will tell\
  \ you how to get from Sawdust Bridge to the Blister Lane Bypass without becoming\
  \ hopelessly entangled in one of those terrible thickets of poisonous nettles.\n\
