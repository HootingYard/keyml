text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I couldn't help noticing that in the piece about\
  \ fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's training regime, Dobson repeatedly refers to\
  \ \u201Csoap flakes in a box\u201D, without telling us which brand of soap flakes\
  \ the champion sprinter used. This is a pity. I cannot be alone among your readers\
  \ in having world-shuddering sporting ambitions, and I try to replicate the fictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol approach in every particular. I have gone so far as to make\
  \ my coach wear an East European raincoat and to chain smoke at the side of the\
  \ track while I scamper round it. I grant you that she looks absolutely nothing\
  \ like Old Halob, and is about half a century younger than he was at his peak, but\
  \ you'd be surprised how effective the illusion can be, especially when she starts\
  \ hawking up gobbets of phlegm just like the cantankerous old rogue.\nIncidentally,\
  \ I am on the lookout for a black Homburg she can wear to make her look even more\
  \ like Old Halob, so if any of your readers know where I might get a genuine 1940s\
  \ Homburg, perhaps they could contact me through your Comments section. I'm afraid\
  \ I do not know my coach's hat size, and nor, I suspect, does she. Gone are the\
  \ days when people were as familiar with their hat size as with their shoe size.\
  \ It is all chips and PINs now, but that doesn't wash with me. I still sprinkle\
  \ cash about, whenever I go roaming, not that I have much time to roam given my\
  \ busy fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol-like training schedule.\nWhich brings me back\
  \ to the matter at hand, namely those soap flakes in a box. Was Dobson leery of\
  \ advertising a brand name, or what? I am aware that he was, or at least tried to\
  \ be, a pamphleteer of considerable moral fibre, but that seems to be taking things\
  \ a bit far. I am sure his legion of fans would have thought no less of him if he\
  \ had bandied brands like Omo or Daz in his pamphlets. When you consider that towering\
  \ intellectual figures of our own day such as Isaiah Berlin regularly turn up on\
  \ television to peddle Twinings tea\u2026 no, that's wrong, it's Stephen Fry, isn't\
  \ it? So easy to confuse two such rigorous \xFCberbrains. Anyway, it is time for\
  \ me to pound around that running track like a mad pursued thing, so I'll stop there.\
  \ But if you can winkle out of the archives any information about those soap flakes\
  \ in a box, I would be extremely grateful. Passionately yours, Tim Thurn, \u201C\
  going for gold!\u201D\n[2007-06-15]"
