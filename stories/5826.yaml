text: "\nI ought to have posted this waxen image last week, to mark the changing of\
  \ the year, but back then, in the past, I had never seen it. It's a detail from\
  \ \u201CTime And Death\u201D by Caterina de Julianis (1695\u20131742), a Neapolitan\
  \ nun and student of the Sicilian abbot and waxworker Gaetano Giulio Zumbo (1656\u2013\
  1701). More here, though I came across it when reading the section on \u201CWax\u201D\
  \ in Marina Warner's Phantasmagoria\_: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, And Media Into\
  \ The Twenty-First Century (2006). Later on in the book I am looking forward to\
  \ \u201CEther\u201D and \u201CEctoplasm\u201D\u2014as, in the latter case, will\
  \ be many visitors to this website. According to the statistics, more people come\
  \ stumbling through the rusty iron gates of Hooting Yard in search of ectoplasm\
  \ than of any other topic\u2014not surprisingly, when we consider Marina Warner's\
  \ observation that \u201Cthe gossip circuits of unofficial knowledge give the mental\
  \ skyscape of the twenty-first century the wild heterogeneity of the Hellenistic\
  \ world, as residues from different eras have adhered to form a sticky, bristling\
  \ deposit. Judaeo-Cabbalistic angels; Gnostic energumens, phantasms and succubi;\
  \ Neoplatonist daimons; Middle Eastern ghouls and genies; Romantic vampires and\
  \ revenants; African, Caribbean, and Native American zombies and spectres\u2014\
  all these various spirits and more besides flock and throng the entertainment ether\
  \ and the world-wide Web\u201D.\n[2011-01-08]"
