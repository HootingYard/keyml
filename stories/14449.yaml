text: "I thought it would be interesting to run a series examining the contents of\
  \ the gloveboxes of the rich and famous. That's right, I had finally taken leave\
  \ of my senses. What was I thinking? For one thing, I have minimal interest in the\
  \ rich and famous. Second, the glovebox is part of a car, and I know nothing about\
  \ cars. Like Pablo Picasso and Derren Brown, I have never learned to drive.\nIt\
  \ could be argued that the contents of a glovebox have nothing to do with the car\
  \ per se, and that there may be intrinsic interest in the jumble of knickknackery\
  \ to be found in the average glovebox. But if that is so, then the contents of the\
  \ gloveboxes of the indigent and wretched are likely to hold as much interest as\
  \ those of the rich and famous. Though of course the degrees of indigence and wretchedness\
  \ are pertinent. The greater they are the less likely the subject would be to own\
  \ a car, and therefore a glovebox.\nCould the word \u201Cglovebox\u201D be applied\
  \ to any box in which gloves are kept? In my world, you're damn right it could!\
  \ I am thinking, for example, of a cardboard shoebox from Freeman, Hardy, and Willis,\
  \ which, when new, contained a pair of shoes, or even galoshes, but which has long\
  \ since been reimagined as a handy box in which to store a selection of gloves,\
  \ particularly discarded single gloves where the matching glove has been lost.\n\
  You might wonder why such gloves, of use only to amputees, have not simply been\
  \ thrown away, into a bin or down a waste chute. You might wonder, but I don't.\
  \ I can discern the beauty in a cardboard box crammed with old and abandoned gloves.\
  \ In fact, I would go so far as to say it is going to waste shoved out of sight\
  \ in a cupboard under the stairs. Better by far to take the lid off, exposing the\
  \ gloves, and paste a little sticker on the side bearing the legend \u201CWhither\
  \ Capitalism?\u201D, and sell it for a small fortune to a contemporary art gallery\
  \ so contemporary art wankers can claim it is an \u201Cinterrogation\u201D of something\
  \ or other. When you have counted up your cash payment from the gallery and stuffed\
  \ it into your pocket, you can punch the nearest art wanker in the throat, which\
  \ is a valuable, if violent, use of anybody's time.\n[2016-01-15]"
