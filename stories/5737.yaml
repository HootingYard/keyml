text: "Listening to the hysterical news reports of our current snow-blanket, one might\
  \ think we had entered a new Ice Age. But this too shall pass. As far as I recall,\
  \ there are such things as seasons. For a sense of perspective, let us turn to George\
  \ A B Dewar\_:\n\u201CAt the acme of the year, days of great June with its clouds\
  \ of endless forms and phantasies, wisp, stipple and fleece of cirrus and cirrostratus,\
  \ snow mountains of cumulus; July with sorceries of silence and the scented breath\
  \ of its eve, with its strange dance of ghost moths at dusk, when Capella is flashing\
  \ intensely out of the afterglow and the gold taper of Mars is alight in the awful\
  \ blue; August knee-deep in the copse grasses with yellow-hammer days; autumn with\
  \ its golden-haired larches; winter with a wine-coloured withy wood by the estuary,\
  \ and the ghost-like earth-cloud, stratus, creeping over the darkening marsh or\
  \ heath; and at the same seasons the whirling columns of winter-gnats and the glittering\
  \ gossamer weighted with rainbow dewdrops. Then there is the faery year of our English\
  \ birds\_: spiral evolution of linnets in the frosty skies, loop of the rooks going\
  \ home to rest, a flock of starlings in autumn black-budding the ash tree a field\
  \ away, swans angel white clipt out on the leaden lake, thrushes singing like mad\
  \ in the grey stormy March dawn.\u201D\nIt is surprising, perhaps, to find that\
  \ an English nature writer in the first decade of the last century was some kind\
  \ of proto-Stalinist, but then there is this\_:\n\u201CThe right enjoyment and study\
  \ of these things must make men and women happier, completer in understanding in\
  \ taste and eye, and therefore better members of the State.\u201D\nQuotes from the\
  \ prefatory note to The Faery Year by George A B Dewar (1906)\n[2010-12-21]"
