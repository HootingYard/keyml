text: "\u201CHe who would valiant be had better buck his ideas up and stop cowering\
  \ behind that shrubbery.\u201D\nI made this observation to my companion as, during\
  \ a morning stroll, we spotted a puny nincompoop quaking with terror behind a clump\
  \ of shrubbery. I could tell he would valiant be because he was wearing the uniform\u2014\
  cap and smock and leggings and boots\u2014of the School of Valour, a nearby institution\
  \ where, once upon a time, I had given some lectures.\nMy companion was a little\
  \ more quick-witted than me.\n\u201CIt occurs to me,\u201D she said, \u201CThat\
  \ as he who would valiant be is quaking with terror, there must needs be some disaster\
  \ in the offing, of which we would do well to take note, and if necessary to guard\
  \ against, or overcome, or stymie.\u201D\n\u201CHow right you are!\u201D I hastened\
  \ to agree, \u201CBut I wonder what the nature of the disaster is. He who would\
  \ valiant be would, in the words of the hymn, be valiant \u2018gainst all disaster.\
  \ It could be anything from an erupting volcano to a bittern storm.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Indeed it could,\u201D she said, \u201CThough I am not sure a bittern storm fits\
  \ into the category of a disaster. It is more a natural phenomenon, an anomalous\
  \ one to be sure, but hardly disastrous.\u201D\n\u201CYou have a point,\u201D I\
  \ said, \u201CBut a sky teeming with birds in terrible numbers seems just the kind\
  \ of thing that might frighten this puny nincompoop cowering behind the shrubbery.\
  \ Look at him!, quaking there, as unvaliant a specimen as has ever worn the cap\
  \ and smock and leggings and boots of the School of Valour!\u201D\n\u201CWell, let\
  \ us approach him, you and I,\u201D she suggested, \u201CFirst to discover from\
  \ his own drooling lips what it is that has him so frit, and second to put some\
  \ fire in his belly.\u201D\nI agreed, and we turned back and pranced arm in arm\
  \ behind the clump of shrubs. Our appearance\u2014me drastically tall and engarbed\
  \ in Tyrolean hiking gear, my companion with the elegance of a swan but with a swan's\
  \ savagery in her eyes\u2014alarmed he who would valiant be. His quaking grew the\
  \ more tremulous, and he made the little whimpering noises of a born milksop.\n\u201C\
  Hey ho!\u201D said my companion, kindly, \u201COf what are you afeared, young student\
  \ of valour?\u201D\n\u201COh pity me,\u201D he wailed, \u201CFor I have been so\
  \ beset round with dismal stories that my legs are like jelly and I have piddled\
  \ myself!\u201D\nAt this intelligence my ears pricked up.\n\u201CDismal stories?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\u201CYes sir, truly dismal stories,\u201D he answered, \u201CI have\
  \ been so beset round with dismal stories of the lumbering walrus-moustached serial\
  \ killer Babinsky that I scarce dare to move in case he comes a-leaping upon me\
  \ with his butcher's cleaver or other instrument of violence.\u201D\nMy companion\
  \ and I withdrew to one side to confer.\n\u201CNeither an erupting volcano nor a\
  \ bittern storm, then,\u201D I said, \u201CBut awful disaster in the form of Babinsky!\u201D\
  \n\u201CIndeed so,\u201D she said, \u201CEven I quake with something not unakin\
  \ to terror at mention of that dreadful name, and I, as you know, was one of the\
  \ top scholars ever to study at the School of Valour.\u201D\n\u201CI know it well,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CThough as I recall you never attended any of the lectures I delivered\
  \ in its august hall.\u201D\n\u201CNo, I did not,\u201D she said, \u201CFor I was\
  \ too busy learning valour in the field, as we say, armed with sword and cudgel,\
  \ fighting giants.\u201D\n\u201CThen you will have missed my lecture on Babinsky,\
  \ in the course of which I gave a series of tips to those who would valiant be on\
  \ how to counter the sense of dread and jellying of the legs and piddling brought\
  \ about by the very thought of the fiend.\u201D\n\u201CTips which I am sure would\
  \ be of immediate benefit to the puny nincompoop,\u201D she said.\n\u201CYes,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CAnd as luck would have it I think I have my lecture notes scrunched\
  \ up in a pocket of my Tyrolean hiking jacket.\u201D\n\u201CThen rummage them out\
  \ and let us return behind the clump of shrubs so you can impart them to he who\
  \ would valiant be. When you are done, he will valiant be, I expect.\u201D\n\u201C\
  A capital idea,\u201D I said, and duly rummaged.\nUnfortunately, when we returned\
  \ behind the shrubbery, he who would valiant be was lying on the ground in several\
  \ separate pieces, each soaked in gore. While our backs were turned, he had been\
  \ set upon by the lumbering walrus-moustached serial killer and chopped to bits\
  \ by his butcher's cleaver. We span around, quaking with terror, knowing Babinsky\
  \ was close. But he had already lumbered away, out of sight, bent on further enormities\
  \ behind other clumps of shrubbery, elsewhere.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D, said my companion,\
  \ \u201CThat was a close shave!\u201D\n\u201CIt was indeed,\u201D I said, \u201C\
  Oh look! Up there, in the sky! Do you see that bittern storm?\u201D\n\u201CI do,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201CAnd I find it not the least bit terrifying, for I would valiant\
  \ be.\u201D\n\u201CUnlike the puny nincompoop,\u201D I said.\n\u201CUnlike the puny\
  \ nincompoop,\u201D she agreed.\n[2012-10-01]"
