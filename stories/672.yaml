text: 'Thrilling TV news! A fantastic new quiz show called The Bleakest Link begins
  tomorrow. Each week, the ghoulish wraiths of long-dead polar explorers, caked in
  ice, compete with each other to answer really hard questions. The winner is the
  icicle-dripping phantom who intones his answers in the bleakest, most ghastly tones.
  Filmed at an abandoned Antarctic weather station, the quiz features a tethered goat.
  A brain scanner attached to the goat measures the extent of its dreadful awe as
  each answer is boomed at it through a funnel, while a goat-physiology monitoring
  mechanism registers its fearful trembling. The quizmaster is Dale Winton, in a reindeer-hide
  anorak.
