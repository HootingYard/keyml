  \ in September 2005. I find myself somewhat alarmed to think that is almost seven\
  \ years ago. Where, where does the time go? Seven years is the length of time the\
  \ Jesuits need to claim a child's soul for life. It is longer than the Second World\
  \ War. Ay de mi! Ay de mi!, as Carlyle would say. For this reappearance, I have\
  \ added some useful notes.]\nIn certain parts of the world, people still sit around\
  \ their fires at dusk and tell each other stories. In the wretched village where\
  \ Marigold Chew grew up, there was one tale in particular that was told over and\
  \ over again. This was the story of Tadeusz Kapisko and his ears of wheat. It was\
  \ told so often\u2014sometimes three or four times in a single evening\u2014that\
  \ it was embedded in Marigold's brain, and years later, she could recount it word\
  \ for word, barely pausing for breath. Dobson always knew when she was about to\
  \ launch into the yarn, because she sucked in her cheeks and puckered her lips in\
  \ what he thought of as \u201Cthat Kapisko way\u201D.\nCuriously, the tale of Tadeusz\
  \ Kapisko and his ears of wheat was never written down, but if Marigold Chew's memory\
  \ is accurate, there was a record of sorts. She remembered, as an infant, seeing\
  \ pictorial representations of the main points of the story, richly painted in crimson,\
  \ cerulean blue and orpiment. Later in life, she tried to describe them.\nI recall\
  \ that the first picture was of Tadeusz Kapisko half hidden behind a cow. It was,\
  \ decisively, a French cow, une vache. I remember thinking how significant this\
  \ was, even as a tiny tot. The second picture was the shape of a medallion. The\
  \ painter overdid the orpiment, but what I loved about this one was that it showed\
  \ the exact moment of a hen's cluck. Tadeusz Kapisko is absent. I think we were\
  \ meant to infer that he had already gone off to war. Certainly that is the import\
  \ of the third picture, in which the Kapisko parents are shown filling rusty farmyard\
  \ pails with their tears. I could almost taste the salt of their sobbing, as they\
  \ waited for the wheat.\nPicture four was missing, it had been torn out, you could\
  \ still see the ghost shade of its adhesive. Some brute or vandal had scribbled\
  \ over the fifth picture with an indelible black marker pen, and the sixth had been\
  \ chewed by squirrels. So it was always a joy to look at the seventh, in which we\
  \ see Tadeusz Kapisko with his ears of wheat at last, returned from the trenches\
  \ minus one eye, leaning against the shed in which all the rusty farmyard pails\
  \ full of his parents\u2019 tears are kept. He is smoking a cheroot and looks the\
  \ spit and image of Josef Starling, though his hair has been painted in cerulean\
  \ blue with flecks of orpiment which may be accidental.\nThe eighth picture is like\
  \ a child's drawing. It shows the helicopters on the helipad, the burning cities,\
  \ and the pit of doom, making the next picture all the more alluring, the delightful\
  \ wash of colours showing meadows dotted with teasel, spurge, gentians, camellias,\
  \ columbine, bedstraw and edelweiss, honeysuckle, lupins and phlox. And hollyhocks,\
  \ hollyhocks.\n\u201COooh, mama! Papa!\u201D I used to pipe, as I turned to picture\
  \ number ten, \u201CWhere are Tadeusz Kapisko's ears of wheat?\u201D And my parents\
  \ would always smile conspiratorially and place their fingers over their mouths,\
  \ and I adored the anticipation of seeing the eleventh and last picture, all crimson\
  \ and cerulean blue and orpiment, King's yellow, the frying pan and the hunchback,\
  \ the countless pigs wallowing in their muck, the detective with his buttons and\
  \ the unshelled peas still snug in their pods, the glockenspiel and the fire extinguisher,\
  \ the tiny glittering ships afloat on the soaking wet sea, and there, if you looked\
  \ ever so closely, on the poop deck of the tiniest ship of all, triumphant in his\
  \ galoshes, with his ears of wheat, Tadeusz Kapisko, brave and strong!\nNOTES\n\
  In certain parts of the world, people still sit around their fires at dusk and tell\
  \ each other stories. One such part of the world, I have learned, is a house on\
  \ Jethro Tull Gardens, a cul-de-sac in a village in Oxfordshire. There, night after\
  \ night after night, folk gather around a fire to tell each other stories based\
  \ on Jethro Tull song lyrics. They transform Mr Anderson's rhymes into prose, creating\
  \ afresh tales of minstrels in galleries, heavy horses, Jeffrey going to Leicester\
  \ Square, and other marvels.\nTadeusz Kapisko. This appears to be a Polish spelling.\
  \ It has been given elsewhere as Thaddeus Capisco. Without knowing the precise location\
  \ of the wretched village where Marigold Chew grew up, we cannot plump for one spelling\
  \ or the other. One thing we can be fairly sure of, however, is that Marigold Chew\
  \ did not grow up in Jethro Tull Gardens. I think we would know, if she had. Or\
  \ do I mean if she did? Had? Did? Do? Be? Doobedoobedoo.\na French cow. I have long\
  \ wondered if this French cow is related to the laughing cow, a red cow usually\
  \ spotted on the paper element of the packaging of foil-wrapped processed cheese\
  \ triangles. For certain children, brought up in blasted urban wastelands far from\
  \ the bosky charms of a rustic idyll, this is the first, and possibly only, cow\
  \ they have ever seen.\nMention of the cow reminds me to draw your attention to\
  \ the latest media report of a cow attack, which I am pleased to note refers in\
  \ passing to David Blunkett. It also includes the immortal line: \u201CIt's hard\
  \ to comprehend just how big a cow is until you're underneath one, looking up at\
  \ it.\u201D\nJosef Starling. Paranoid, pock-marked Georgian, dictator of the Soviet\
  \ Union, died in 1953. Often confused with Clarice Stalin, heroine of The Silence\
  \ Of The Cows Lambs, a potboiler by Thomas Harris.\nthe burning cities. Possibly\
  \ the same burning cities alluded to in Nine Funerals Of A Citizen King by Henry\
  \ Cow. I have searched in vain on maps for a cul-de-sac called Henry Cow Gardens.\n\
