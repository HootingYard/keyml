text: "Last night I dreamt I went to Pointy Town again. I went by way of the Blister\
  \ Lane Bypass, where important roadworks were taking place. In spite of the fact\
  \ that I have never in my life been within twenty feet of a pneumatic drill, I took\
  \ it into my head that I wished, with all my heart, to take part in the roadworks.\
  \ I hopped off my bus\u2014a number 666\u2014dodged through the many container lorries\
  \ thundering along the road in both directions, and, anent a muddy trench, grabbed\
  \ hold of an unattended machine tool. With sure and steady thumb, I depressed the\
  \ knob that spurred the machine to life, and proceeded to gouge out crumbly slabs\
  \ of geological significance from the bottom of the trench. This being a dream,\
  \ I was able to continue my deft roadworks until I reached the burning core at the\
  \ centre of the earth. I stilled my machine, and dug through the final layers of\
  \ rock fragments with my bare hands, and there I discovered an egg.\n\u201CThis\
  \ is the egg of the world,\u201D I said, \u201CI wonder what will hatch from it?\u201D\
  \nWith the egg nestled in a pocket of my Tyrolean jacket, I clambered back up to\
  \ the earth's surface. Oddly, instead of finding myself at the Blister Lane Bypass,\
  \ I was in Pointy Town itself, near the viaduct, outside the Old Collapsing Abandoned\
  \ Swimming Pool. The door was ajar, and I pushed it open without the least trace\
  \ of fear and stepped inside. As I did so, I heard the egg in my pocket crack.\n\
  In the empty pool, with its distorting acoustics, a jug band, as if awaiting my\
  \ arrival, struck up a jug band arrangement of \u201CMother Goose\u201D by Jethro\
  \ Tull. Was it a goose egg I had in my pocket? I fumbled in my pocket to hoist out\
  \ the cracking egg. Something nipped my fingers, and I quickly pulled out my hand,\
  \ eggless. Blood was flowing, far more copiously than one would expect from the\
  \ tiny bite I had received. I waved my hand and my blood splattered the jug band.\
  \ They played on, undisturbed.\nThat is the thing about dreams, they make no sense.\
  \ They have no significance. I am not even sure what a jug band is. I have never\
  \ engaged in rogue roadworks. I have never been to Pointy Town.\n[2013-04-21]"
