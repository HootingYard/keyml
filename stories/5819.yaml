text: "As any fule kno, 99.9% of what passes for \u201Cart\u201D in this witless age\
  \ is mere piffle. As a rule of thumb, anything with the Charles Saatchi imprimatur\
  \ can be safely consigned to the waste chute of history. It is also very probably\
  \ true that anyone who describes themselves as an \u201Cartist\u201D (as opposed\
  \ to painter, potter, sculptor\u2014emphasising the craft) is actually an idiot.\
  \ Of course, it is the idiots who are showered with money and kudos.\nIn a brighter,\
  \ more sensible world, some of the unknown amateurs tirelessly plying their crafts\
  \ outwith the public gaze would be our stars. But then, perhaps it is because they\
  \ are unknown and amateur and ploughing their own lonely furrows that their work\
  \ is valuable.\nAll by way of preamble to egging you to delight in Outa_Spaceman's\
  \ latest project. Thus far, seven signs in seven days, marvellously enlivening his\
  \ little south coast bailiwick. Saatchi ought to write him a cheque immediately\u2014\
  ah, but OSM didn't go to Goldsmiths, and he doesn't live in Hoxton, and he isn't\
  \ a wanker, so he must continue to ply his craft in obscurity. But we can celebrate\
  \ it.\n\nADDENDUM\_: Some readers, seeing the heading \u201CArt\u201D, will have\
  \ supposed this postage to be devoted to Mr Garfunkel, singer, poet, pedestrian\
  \ and polymath. But according to his own website, he is known not as \u201CArt\u201D\
  , nor even as \u201CMr Garfunkel\u201D, but as \u201CThe G\u201D.\n[2011-01-08]"
