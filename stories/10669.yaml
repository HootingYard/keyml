  You will be thrilled to learn that Mr Key has returned to Blighty after his frolics
  on foreign shores. But before popping open that celebratory can of Squelcho! and
  throwing your hat in the air, bear in mind that I am a sick and snuffle-headed man,
  much given over the past few days to lying prostrate with my hand held to my forehead,
  like Bulle Ogier in Celine And Julie Go Boating, whimpering.

  I did manage to drag my bones to Resonance yesterday to declaim prose into a microphone
  for thirty minutes, and I cobbled together an anecdote about my holiday for The
  Dabbler. Other than that, prose has failed to pour out of me. Further dispatches
  from Hooting Yard soon, God willing. But for now, I am going to suck a Strepsil
  (honey and lemon).
