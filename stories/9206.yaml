text: "[With thanks to R.]\n\nGet Wheatear is an ornithological thriller film which\
  \ has become a cult favourite in the years since its release. The plot is as follows:\n\
  Pointy Town-born birdwatcher Jack Carter has lived in Tantarabim for years in the\
  \ employ of criminal ornithologists the Fletchers. Jack is sleeping with Fletcher's\
  \ girlfriend Anna and plans to escape to a dilapidated seaside resort with her.\
  \ But first he must return to Pointy Town to attend the funeral of his brother,\
  \ Frank, who died in a purported birds\u2019 nest egg-thieving accident. Not satisfied\
  \ with the verdict Jack wants to do his own investigating. At the funeral Jack meets\
  \ with his brother's teenage daughter Doreen, and Frank's mistress Margaret, who\
  \ is evasive.\nJack goes to the owl sanctuary seeking an old acquaintance called\
  \ Albert Swift, whose surname is also that of a bird, for information about his\
  \ brother\u2018s death. Swift evades him, but Jack encounters another old associate,\
  \ Eric Paice, now employed as a grader of birdseed, although he will not say for\
  \ whom. Tailing Eric to the country house of expert ornithologist Cyril Kinnear,\
  \ Jack bursts in on Kinnear playing Spot The Chaffinch. He meets a glamorous but\
  \ drunken lady called Glenda. Having learned little but made his presence felt Jack\
  \ leaves; Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers.\
  \ Back in town Jack is threatened by henchmen dressed in hen costumes to leave town,\
  \ but he fights them off; capturing and interrogating one to find out who wanted\
  \ him gone, and is given the name Brumby.\nJack knows Cliff Brumby as a bird fancier\
  \ with controlling interests in local seaside amusement arcades. Visiting Brumby's\
  \ house, Jack discovers Brumby knows nothing about him; believing he has been set\
  \ up he leaves. Next morning, two of Jack's birdwatching colleagues from Tantarabim\
  \ arrive, sent by the Fletchers to take him back, but he escapes. Jack meets Margaret\
  \ to talk about Frank, but Fletcher's men are waiting and pursue him. He is rescued\
  \ by Glenda driving a sports car, who takes him to meet Brumby at his new rooftop\
  \ aviary development atop a multi-storey car park. Brumby identifies Kinnear as\
  \ Frank's killer, explaining Kinnear is trying to take over his bird-related activities.\
  \ He offers Jack \xA35,000 if he will kill the expert ornithologist, which he refuses.\n\
  Jack compares birds\u2019 eggs with Glenda at her flat, where he finds and watches\
  \ a film about wheatears. The human participants are shown to be Doreen, Glenda,\
  \ Margaret and Albert Swift. Doreen is forced to swap birds\u2019 eggs with Swift.\
  \ Overcome with emotion, Jack is enraged and he half drowns Glenda in the bath.\
  \ She tells him the film was Kinnear's and she thinks Doreen was \u2018pulled\u2019\
  \ by Eric. Forcing Glenda in the boot of her car, Jack drives off to find Albert.\n\
  Jack tracks Albert down in an owl sanctuary, and Albert confesses he told Brumby\
  \ that Doreen was Frank's daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to\
  \ call the police on Kinnear. Eric and two of his men were responsible for Frank's\
  \ death, forcing him to climb up a sycamore to a high birds\u2019 nest having weakened\
  \ the boughs by partly sawing through them. Information extracted, Jack knifes Albert\
  \ in the stomach for being an accessory. Jack is attacked by the Tantarabim birdwatchers\
  \ and by Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna's affair. Jack shoots\
  \ one of them dead; Eric and the others escape, pushing the sports car into the\
  \ river, with Glenda still trapped inside. Returning to the car park Jack finds\
  \ Brumby, beating him senseless and throwing him over the side to his death. He\
  \ then posts the film about wheatears to the Bird Detectives Squad at Blister Lane\
  \ in Tantarabim.\nJack abducts Margaret at gunpoint. He sends a metal tapping machine\
  \ message to Kinnear in the middle of an ornithological gathering, telling him he\
  \ has the wheatear film and making a deal to give him Eric in exchange for his silence.\
  \ Kinnear agrees, sending Eric to an agreed location; however, he simultaneously\
  \ sends a metal tapping machine message to a starling taxidermist to dispose of\
  \ Jack. Jack drives Margaret to the grounds of Kinnear's estate, kills her with\
  \ a fatal injection of ducks\u2019 blood and leaves her body there; then he calls\
  \ the police to raid Kinnear's gathering.\nJack chases Eric along a beach until\
  \ he is exhausted. He forces Eric to drink a full bottle of ducks\u2019 blood, then\
  \ beats him to death with a hardback copy of A Complete Illustrated Register Of\
  \ All The Birds In The Known Universe. As Jack is walking back along the shoreline,\
  \ he is shot by the starling taxidermist with a sniper rifle. Jack's corpse lies\
  \ on the beach as the waves wash around him. Later, it is stuffed by the starling\
  \ taxidermist and put on display in a glass case in Pointy Town High Street, as\
  \ a warning to others.\nOne particularly famous scene is the dialogue between Jack\
  \ and Brumby at the site of the aviary development.\nJack\_: Tell me what you know\
  \ about wheatears, Brumby!\nBrumby\_: That depends on what type of wheatear you're\
  \ talking about, Jack. Do you mean northern wheatears, Isabelline wheatears, desert\
  \ wheatears, black-eared wheatears, pied wheatears, Cyprus wheatears, Finsch's wheatears,\
  \ mourning wheatears, Arabian wheatears, hooded wheatears, white-crowned wheatears,\
  \ black wheatears, Kurdish wheatears, rufous-tailed wheatears, red-rumped wheatears,\
  \ Hume's wheatears, mountain wheatears, Somali wheatears, variable wheatears, capped\
  \ wheatears, red-breasted wheatears, or Heuglin's wheatears?\nJack\_: Variable.\n\
  Brumby\_: Now you're talking, son.\nJack\_: Well spit it out then, you git.\nBrumby\_\
  : Bloody variable, them variable wheatears, bloody variable, Jack, like you wouldn't\
  \ believe.\nJack\_: Oh I believe you all right. [Watches in amazement as Brumby\
  \ is borne aloft by a flock of specially-trained linnets.]\nAlso of note is that\
  \ the film-within-a-film was directed by a man named Partridge, or possibly Siskin.\
  \ The siskin is not a wheatear, but an attractive little finch.\n[2012-05-19]"
