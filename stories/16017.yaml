text: "\nOi, you lot. Mr Key has just popped out to a kiosk on an errand, and while\
  \ he's gone I want to have a quick word with you.\nIn a few weeks\u2019 time, we\
  \ will be marking the birthday of gentle baby Jesus, who grew up to become Christ\
  \ Our Saviour. People celebrate the occasion, not by prostrating themselves before\
  \ the old rugged cross and begging for the Lord's mercy, but by giving each other\
  \ presents. Being a git, I do not quite understand this, but that's how it is.\n\
  And that being the case, what better gift could you lot give your loved ones than\
  \ a Hooting Yard paperback? Imagine their Christmas morning glee when, expecting\
  \ socks or piffle, they unwrap from its wrappings a book cram-packed with sweeping\
  \ paragraphs of majestic prose by Mr Key!\nIf you go to the main page and cast your\
  \ eyes over the sidebar you will find no fewer than nine paperbacks to choose from,\
  \ plus a hardback and an ebook. That is eleven happy friends and family members\
  \ who will have their noses stuck in a book on Christmas Day!\nMeanwhile, do not\
  \ forget poor scribbling Mr Key himself. All year he has been bashing out this stuff\
  \ for your entertainment and moral edification, and you have been able to read it\
  \ free of charge. Why not show your appreciation by making a donation, either a\
  \ one-off pittance or a regular monthly amount? You'll find Paypal links in the\
  \ sidebar below the books.\nBe sensible. And a very merry Christmas to you all.\n\
  The Hooting Yard Duty Git\n[2017-12-02]"
