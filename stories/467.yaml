  \ And yet it is still a thing of beauty, I think.\nIf I had more skill in technical\
  \ jiggery-pokery, I would have copied the image and posted it here to save you following\
  \ the link, but it didn't seem to lend itself to standard copying and pasting. Perhaps\
  \ I can rely on the helpful nature of a technobod reader to tell me how to do that,\
  \ and also to tell me if it's possible to do a Wordle of all of Hooting Yard, rather\
  \ than just some of it.\nN.B.\u2014There is a second one here.\n[2008-07-06]"
