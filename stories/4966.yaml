text: "She was a plucky tot, a heroic infant, and a little fascist\u2026 but was Tiny\
  \ Enid also a feminist pioneer? On the face of it, the answer to that question seems\
  \ self-evident. How else would one describe the club-footed young gal, pootling\
  \ about in her clapped-out jalopy, puffing away at cheroots, essaying deeds of matchless\
  \ valour, and giving a variety of malefactors a good kicking? Yet such were the\
  \ constraints imposed by society on what was deemed seemly, Tiny Enid oftbetimes\
  \ made great pretence of being a helpless weedy flibbertigibbety waif, ready to\
  \ swoon away or throw a fit of the vapours. Sometimes she put on such a show even\
  \ while performing one of her brave deeds. In this picture, for example, it looks\
  \ as if Tiny Enid is about to topple from a hot air balloon basket, and is being\
  \ saved by a pair of tender-hearted ruffians. She is, of course, acting out the\
  \ part expected of her in a patriarchal culture. What is actually happening here\
  \ is that Tiny Enid is cleverly distracting the ruffians\u2014card-carrying members\
  \ of the Communist Party, no less!\u2014for, moments after the sketch was completed,\
  \ she was back in the basket, her big black boot stamping on the neck of one ruffian\
  \ while the other flung himself overboard in a cowardly escape from the tot's righteous\
  \ wrath.\n\nPicture courtesy of Agence Eureka\n[2010-08-06]"
