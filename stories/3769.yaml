text: "I was out strolling by the canal the other morning when I was accosted by an\
  \ ACRONYM\u2014an Asbo-Carrying Ruffian Of Narrow Yob Mentality. He growled something\
  \ unintelligible at me in his barbaric innit-spreche, which I countered by telling\
  \ him, as bravely as I could, that I offered him the chance to turn himself from\
  \ an ACRONYM into an ACROSTIC\u2014an Asbo-Carrying Ruffian Of Spiritual Transfiguration\
  \ In Christ.\nWithout waiting for his reply, I whipped out of my pocket my much-thumbed\
  \ paperback copy of the Selected Poems of duck-mesmerising Victorian Jesuit Gerard\
  \ Manley Hopkins, and immediately began to declaim, in a booming voice, \u201CGod's\
  \ Grandeur\u201D.\n\u201CThe world is charged with the grandeur of God. / It will\
  \ flame out, like shining from shook foil; / It gathers to a greatness, like the\
  \ ooze of oil / Crushed.\u201D\nThe ACRONYM was too sunk in his vacuity to react\
  \ in any perceptible way, but the words of Hopkins are shocking and mighty and irresistible,\
  \ and I knew I had the upper hand.\nNearby, on a leaf, a mealybug unfurled its wings\
  \ and soared high into the heavens.\nMy work was almost done. I took the ACRONYM\
  \ by the hand and led him towards the church, where Father Boggis waited with an\
  \ old rugged cross and a handful of nails. I patted my pocket, feeling for the hammer\
  \ I carried there. I looked forward to landing the first blow, nailing to the rough\
  \ wood the filthy ruffian hand I held in mine.\nNOTE\_: For readers outside the\
  \ UK, it may be helpful to explain that an Asbo, or ASBO, is itself an acronym,\
  \ for Anti-Social Behaviour Order, a terrifying deterrent to scalliwags, innit.\n\
