text: "Traditionally, the tanager is the new year bird of Hooting Yard. A small to\
  \ medium sized member of the bird family Thraupidae, the tanager picks insects off\
  \ branches, often has a rather dull song, and lives in a cup nest on a tree branch.\
  \ Sometimes the cup can be almost globular, but that's a tanager for you. Because\
  \ it is a tropical bird, flocks of tanagers are incredibly rare in the sky around\
  \ Haemoglobin Towers, so the majority of Hooting Yard's new year tanager birds are\
  \ made of paper or cardboard. Well, all of them. The making of paper or cardboard\
  \ birds, often very elaborate ones, but sometimes really quite shoddy and slapdash,\
  \ has long been found to be a splendid way of keeping the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage\
  \ busy during the winter nights, when other, more fortunate children are fast asleep.\
  \ Throughout the month of December, the orphanage attic, open to the freezing and\
  \ black night sky, rings out with the jolly cries of infants competing with each\
  \ other to craft the very best paper or cardboard tanager using shredded newspaper\
  \ or crumpled cartons or torn-up Popsie The Pig annuals donated by a foundlings\u2019\
  \ charity. These latter are eagerly grasped by the larger and more lumbering orphans,\
  \ for the pretty coloured pictures of Popsie The Pig and her pals make for splendid\
  \ plumage on the paper birds. On New Year's Eve, each tiny collapses with exhaustion\
  \ on the floor of the attic, and a trio of worthies roams among their fallen little\
  \ bodies, destroying all but one of the paper or cardboard tanagers with hammers\
  \ and slicers. The sole surviving paper bird is carried off for the Hooting Yard\
  \ festivities that begin at dawn on New Year's Day, by which time the orphans have\
  \ been bundled downstairs and locked into the filthy and infested canteen for their\
  \ breakfast of cauliflower water and radishes.\n[2008-01-01]"
