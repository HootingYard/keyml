text: "Jasper The Baffled Eel is a brand new children's book about an eel named Jasper\
  \ who is baffled. What baffles him? Oh, just about everything that happens in his\
  \ life as an eel. I don't need to go into the details, as I am sure you can imagine\
  \ yourself as an eel and tally up in your head all the things that would baffle\
  \ you.\nI say it is a children's book, and that is indeed how it has been marketed\
  \ by the soulless twerps in the marketing department of the publishing house. But\
  \ I suspect the book may appeal more to older readers, very old readers, those in\
  \ or approaching their dotage. It may even prove popular among those who have passed\
  \ beyond dotage into death. At rest and encoffined, what better token of life to\
  \ take with them, clutched in their cold stiff hands, than this baffling eely book?\n\
  There are no illustrations. Most of the words are simple ones, of one or two syllables,\
  \ with only a few instances of longer or less common words, among which I noted\
  \ flapdoodle, japonaiserie, and haemoglobin. Jasper the eel is baffled by these\
  \ words, but you will not be, not even if you are dead, because nothing baffles\
  \ the dead.\nThey say walls have ears, but birds and eels do not. They also say\
  \ that Jesus wants me for a sunbeam, but try telling that to an eel. You will only\
  \ baffle the eel, as Jasper is baffled, in a bravura display of realism. It may\
  \ even be hyperrealism. There were certainly points in the book where I felt, vividly,\
  \ that I had been plunged into the wide Sargasso sea. I was sopping wet and festooned\
  \ with seaweed. Though it is fair to say that I am usually sopping and festooned,\
  \ when reading books. It is, and always has been, my way.\nOh, Jasper! Jasper! Poor\
  \ baffled eel. No longer a glass eel or an elver, with its life stretching before\
  \ it, full of promise, but a full-grown adult eel, lost in the immensity of the\
  \ world's oceans and seas and rivers and lakes and other watery parts, watery parts\
  \ that cover seven-tenths of this globe, with its magnetic bits and its vegetation\
  \ and its eels. For Jasper is not alone.\nBut he is alone, in this book. Population\
  \ of eels in its pages\u2014one. One eel, but oh! how he fills those pages, turning\
  \ up once, twice, even three times before it is time for you to turn the leaf. And\
  \ that is not surprising, because this is his story. No other eel gets a look in,\
  \ and nor does any other living creature, other than occasional mentions of a rabbit\
  \ and a plover and a brass-necked goose. But these are incidental beings. They will,\
  \ one day, have their own books, in which Jasper the eel may make a fleeting appearance.\n\
  I would have been interested to learn more, in this book, about eels and japonaiserie.\
  \ But then, most people who know me well will attest that I constantly carp on about\
  \ eels and japonaiserie, to the exclusion of other, perhaps more pressing, matters.\
  \ I make no apology. Though I may never be transfigured into a sunbeam for Jesus,\
  \ I have buttered my parsnips, and I will take them with me to the grave, instead\
  \ of my copy of Jasper The Baffled Eel, which I will donate to an orphanage library,\
  \ for the future edification of generation after generation of orphaned tinies,\
  \ as baffled as Jasper by the complexities of this complex and baffling universe.\n\
  Now let us all sing Sag Mir Wo Die Blumen Sind?\n[2017-09-21]"
