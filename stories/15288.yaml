text: 'No doubt you will be busy today organising a street party, hanging out streams
  of bunting, distributing paper plates piled high with sausage rolls and slices of
  fairy cake, and arranging entertainments featuring high-pitched discordant screaming,
  the cutting off of clothes, and world peace. Yes! It''s Yoko Ono''s 84th birthday.
