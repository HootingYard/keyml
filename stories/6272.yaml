text: 'I have been thinking of drawing a Venn diagram showing all possible Venns.
  There is John Venn himself, the invenntor of the diagram, also notable for having
  built an automatic cricket-ball-bowling machine which was used to great effect in
  Cambridge in 1909 against a visiting Australian XI. There is red ochre-stained Diggory
  Venn, the reddleman from Hardy''s The Return Of The Native (1878). And there is
  a hamlet in Saskatchewan called Venn which, in its glory days, had a wood crib grain
  elevator.

  There, that is three Venns to be going on with, sufficient for a diagram. Time to
  get the coloured pencils and paper!
