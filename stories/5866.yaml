text: "Sometimes, though rarely, Dobson's heart would swell with a charitable impulse,\
  \ and on one such occasion he hatched the plan of inventing a novelty sandwich paste,\
  \ the profit from sales of which he would donate to his local otter sanctuary.\n\
  \u201CI shall call it Otter Sanctuary Sandwich Paste,\u201D he explained to Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CThe better to fix in the minds of my customers the eventual destination\
  \ of their pennies.\u201D\n\u201CIt is a capital idea, Dobson,\u201D replied Marigold\
  \ Chew, \u201CBut it has a fatal flaw.\u201D\nDobson's face soured.\n\u201COh? And\
  \ what might that be?\u201D he asked.\n\u201CWe do not have a local otter sanctuary,\u201D\
  \ said Marigold Chew. And she tossed a pebble off the bridge across which they were\
  \ ploughing, into the tumultuous river below.\nLater, back at home, the out of print\
  \ pamphleteer racked his brains for a way to salvage his scheme, for the charitable\
  \ impulse was still throbbing. After a prolonged bout of pencil-sharpening, which\
  \ he found conducive to concentrated thought, Dobson made a Eurekaish grunting noise\
  \ and ran out into the garden, where Marigold Chew was busy with a pair of pruning\
  \ shears.\n\u201CWho says the otter sanctuary need be a local one?\u201D he cried,\
  \ \u201CI can divert the profits to a remote otter sanctuary!\u201D\n\u201CAll well\
  \ and good,\u201D said his inamorata, \u201CBut consider something else, Dobson.\
  \ Is there not a danger that your potential customers, otter-lovers every man jack\
  \ of them, might construe that a paste called Otter Sanctuary Sandwich Paste is\
  \ actually made out of pulverised otters? Even if they are wrong, I suspect sales\
  \ would suffer, simply due to the misunderstanding.\u201D\nDobson retreated indoors\
  \ and sharpened dozens more pencils. An hour later he was back in the garden.\n\u201C\
  Each tub of Otter Sanctuary Sandwich Paste would bear a label, a bold and bright\
  \ label, on which would be emblazoned the slogan \u2018Does Not Contain Otters\u2019\
  . That would set the otter-lovers\u2019 minds at rest, would it not?\u201D\n\u201C\
  It would,\u201D said Marigold Chew, snipping a sprig from a shrub, \u201CBut what\
  \ ingredients would your sandwich paste contain, if it is to be, as you suggested\
  \ while we were ploughing across the bridge earlier, a novelty sandwich paste?\u201D\
  \n\u201CDon't worry about that,\u201D said Dobson, airily, \u201CI will think of\
  \ something.\u201D\nDobson now had two immediate tasks to accomplish, which we can\
  \ summarise for the slow-witted reader as follows.\n1. To identify a remote otter\
  \ sanctuary deserving of the out of print pamphleteer's largesse.\n2. To concoct\
  \ a novelty sandwich paste the recipe for which must contain not a trace of otter\
  \ nor of the by-products of otters.\nTo facilitate his thinking on these critical\
  \ matters, Dobson would need to sharpen a goodly number of pencils. Yet every pencil\
  \ in the house had been sharpened to its utmost pointiness, as a result of which\
  \ the blades of the Dobson-Chew pencil sharpener were blunted, and needed either\
  \ to be honed upon a whetstone or else replaced with new blades. Thus, in addition\
  \ to the tasks enumerated above, the pamphleteer faced two further challenges, viz:\n\
  1. To obtain a fresh batch of pencils.\n2(a). To have sharpened the existing blades\
  \ of the pencil sharpener, or\n2(b). To replace the blades with brand new ones,\
  \ gleaming and lethal.\nA moment's thought was all Dobson needed to realise that\
  \ he could accomplish both these aims by paying a visit to the stationery department\
  \ at Hubermann's. In spite of the fact that it was pouring buckets of rain, he donned\
  \ his Belgian Railway Official's boots, lacing them so tightly he was in danger\
  \ of cutting off the blood supply below his ankles, and clattered out of the house\
  \ into the downpour.\nOne thing it is important for the reader to understand about\
  \ Dobson is that, in spite of his bookish erudition, he was a man profoundly ignorant\
  \ of the natural world. His witlessness in ornithological matters is well-attested.\
  \ But did you know that, if you were to line up for him, as at an identity parade,\
  \ an otter and a stoat and a weasel and a vole and a shrew, Dobson would have a\
  \ deal of difficulty telling you which was which? He had never paid proper attention\
  \ to his small mammal lessons at school, and forever after in life was lumbered\
  \ with bafflement about such creatures.\nKnowing this, we can grasp an understanding\
  \ of what happened next. Trudging along the towpath of the filthy old canal on his\
  \ way to Hubermann's in the rain, Dobson was set upon by a trio of savage and starving\
  \ small mammals roused by the smell of his Belgian Railway Official's boots. They\
  \ had, you see, recently been smeared with a protective coat of some sort of dubbin-substitute\
  \ by a wizened and scrofulous pedlar who came a-knocking at Dobson's door hawking\
  \ his wares. Whatever this substance was, and however well or ill it protected the\
  \ boots, it was absolutely irresistible to certain small mammals. Thus it was that,\
  \ in their frenzy about Dobson's feet, his tiny attackers caused the pamphleteer\
  \ to lose his balance, and he toppled over the edge of the towpath into the canal.\n\
  The rain had reduced to a drizzle by the time Dobson, sopping wet and with bits\
  \ of canal-water vegetation sticking out of his bouffant, came crashing through\
  \ the door and slumped in a chair. Marigold Chew gave him a quizzing look. He told\
  \ her of his mishap.\n\u201CThat remote otter sanctuary won't get a penny from my\
  \ sandwich paste!\u201D shouted Dobson, \u201CIn fact, to be on the safe side I\
  \ am not even going to make any sandwich paste! That will show them!\u201D\n\u201C\
  But was it a trio of otters that attacked your boots, or could it perhaps have been\
  \ stoats or weasels or voles or shrews?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\nIncapable of\
  \ a sensible response, Dobson fell into a sulk.\nA few miles away, on the outskirts\
  \ of another town, a wizened and scrofulous pedlar hawking his wares knocked upon\
  \ another door. In his punnet, he had jars and jars of paste for sale. Each was\
  \ labelled, but the labels were hard to decipher. In one light, they read \u201C\
  Dubbin Substitute\u201D, but then, seen from a different angle, \u201CNovelty Sandwich\
  \ Paste\u201D. The pedlar was dressed all in green, and when he spoke, the timbre\
  \ of his voice cast a spooky spell, as if he were a figure from a fairytale.\n[2011-01-16]"
