text: "\u201CWhen one opens a door there's something on the far side that was not\
  \ there before. I had a premonition that it would be irrevocable when, from a crate\
  \ filled with wood-shavings or curly paper, she unpacked the death mask of her late\
  \ husband. Even when they were drawing up the ground plan of our future house some\
  \ had thought the choice of site a dubious one, for there was an underground spring\
  \ there in which the foundations would some day be awash. But with much labour and\
  \ expense the water was diverted. There was another disagreeable impression I will\
  \ not pass over. It was like this. When we went to look at the house, which was\
  \ just being finished\u2014the beribboned tree already set on the rooftop by the\
  \ master carpenter\u2014there, in the future bathroom, where the spring had been\
  \ piped and made to provide our water-supply, there was an aquarium such as people\
  \ use for ornamental fish. It was full of hideous creatures swirling around in clusters.\
  \ This was the visiting card of someone I loathed, a candidate for the lady's favours,\
  \ a zoologist who had made a name for himself with experiments in cross-breeding.\
  \ Presumably he had caught these toads here in order to take them to Vienna and\
  \ use them for his experiments in the Institute in the Prater. A few days earlier\
  \ he had committed suicide\u2014this I learnt subsequently. So this was his bequest\
  \ to us. As quickly as I could I emptied the tub full of batrachians into the swampy\
  \ field that had come into existence all round the house since the previous winter.\
  \ What I should have liked best would have been to spare her the sight of these\
  \ fat-bellied creatures, for she was pregnant. Instead she had to watch and see\
  \ how each of the yellowish, disgusting toads of the larger sort, the females, carried\
  \ one of the smaller, greenish males to the water on her back. In coupling with\
  \ the females the males had fastened on to their sides with their sucker-feet. It\
  \ was early spring.\u201D\nFrom A Sea Ringed With Visions by Oskar Kokoschka (1962)\
  \ Though he does not name her, \u201Cshe\u201D is Alma Mahler\u2014the actual woman\
  \ as opposed to the later rag doll.\n[2009-11-14]"
