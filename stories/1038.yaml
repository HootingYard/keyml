text: "A dandy was the\_Black Prince of Elegance, the demigod of boredom who looked\
  \ at the world with an eye as glassy as his pince-nez, suffering because his disarranged\
  \ cravat had a crease, like the ancient Sybarite who suffered because his rose was\
  \ crushed. He is indifferent about the horse he rides, the woman he greets, and\
  \ the man he encounters and at whom he gazes a while before recognizing him. He\
  \ bears, written on his forehead\u2014in English\u2014this insolent inscription:\
  \ What do you and I have in common?\_\u2013 Paul de Saint-Victor, 1859\nVia The\
  \ Victorian Era\n\_\n[2008-11-30]"
