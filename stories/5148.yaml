  \ on which was scribbled the following:\n11 Petiver, Buddle & Doody. 48 Withering.\

  \ hammer on the Sabbath. 129 Discovery of plankton.\nDeploying my Holmesian deductive\
  \ skills, I worked out that these were notes I had made, long ago, when reading\
  \ The Naturalist In Britain\_: A Social History by David Elliston Allen (1976).\
  \ Seeking enlightenment, I located the volume on the teetering bookshelves, and\
  \ turned to the relevant pages. In some cases, it is no longer clear to me what\
  \ sparked my interest. Others, however, I was extremely pleased to be reminded of.\
  \ Here are the relevant quotes:\n\u201CRousseau's extreme short-sight was such that\
  \ at the best of times he saw the landscape as a blur, while his wife, in similar\
  \ fashion, never knew which day of the week it was and never even learned to tell\
  \ the time.\u201D\n\u201CIn many ways [Buckland] was undeniably a very curious person:\
  \ an oddly truncated man\u2026 He sported childish jests and puns, devised peculiar\
  \ contraptions, went in for the weirdest kinds of food\u2026 It was typical of him\
  \ that he drove round in a special kind of carriage, strengthened in an ostentatious\
  \ manner\u2026 he carried around a mysterious blue bag\u2026 he led his students\
  \ on excursions into the field wearing quite incongruously formal clothes.\u201D\
  \n\u201CRobert Dick\u2026 \u2018the Botanist of Thurso\u2019 made it his regular\
  \ practice to walk all day, for up to forty miles, with one ship's biscuit as his\
  \ only sustenance.\u201D\n\u201CPhilip Henry Gosse became so lost in his work that\
  \ he registered the birth of his only child with the remarkable entry in his diary:\
  \ \u2018Received green swallow from Jamaica. E delivered of a son.'\u201D\n[2010-08-30]"
