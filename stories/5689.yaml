text: "It has come to my attention that several readers think Saint Poppo, he of the\
  \ radiating lance, is a figment of my imagination. I am, apparently, given to dubbing\
  \ fictional characters with names not dissimilar to \u201CPoppo\u201D\u2014one is\
  \ reminded, perhaps, of Signor Ploppo, who had a dramatic conversation with a bird\
  \ called Ambrose.\nWhile I emit an equally dramatic sigh, may I point out, yet again,\
  \ with some exasperation, that the content of this website, and of the allied Hooting\
  \ Yard podcast, is almost entirely factual, based as it is on exhaustive research?\
  \ It is true that occasionally I might make something up from a sense of mischief,\
  \ or embroider certain facts to add a tad of piquancy or grit, but generally speaking,\
  \ what you have here is straightforward reportage. This planet of ours is a very\
  \ odd orb, you know.\nJust in case there remain some doubting Thomases, I reproduce\
  \ below a tremendous photograph of a fully poseable toy action figure of Poppo.\
  \ You will find some accompanying text here. Please remember to pray for Poppo's\
  \ intercession should you be dropsical.\n\n[2010-12-12]"
