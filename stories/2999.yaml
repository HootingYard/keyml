text: "The New Psalmanazar reminds us of catalogues of lost or imaginary books compiled\
  \ by Sir Thomas Browne and Fran\xE7ois Rabelais, which in turn reminded me that\
  \ for some time I have been planning an exhaustive catalogue raisonn\xE9 of the\
  \ out of print pamphlets of Dobson. This would be an inestimable boon to the amateur\
  \ Dobsonist, unable to gain access to the official archive because they haven't\
  \ got either a ticket or a key or indeed a clue as to which high Alpine pass it\
  \ is situated in.\n\nFran\xE7ois Rabelais\nMany, many, many of Dobson's pamphlets\
  \ have been mentioned in these pages over the years, but even that fragmentary list\
  \ has never been cobbled together into a coherent whole. Mr Key himself has avoided\
  \ the task, sad to say, forever devising new and ludicrous excuses, such as flint\
  \ in the heart or reruns of Daktari. A while ago, there was a suggestion that a\
  \ team of feral teenagers could be taken off the streets and locked in a bunker\
  \ until they had compiled a complete list, but it was rightly objected that they\
  \ could not be trusted to resist appending \u201Cinnit\u201D to the end of each\
  \ title. Judicious Tippexing could expunge such desecration, but who would wield\
  \ the Tippex?\n\nSir Thomas Browne\nAlas, it seems the Dobson catalogue raisonn\xE9\
  \ may have to join a list of lost or imagined catalogues, alongside such magisterial\
  \ lists as The Map Reference Points Of 400 Duckponds Mentioned In Binder's Lieder\
  \ and All Pebblehead's Cravats, Illustrated And Itemised.\n[2009-09-03]"
