text: "Diligent readers of the Comments will know that the other day I got into a\
  \ bit of a flap when someone had the temerity to include one of those godawful smiley\
  \ faces to accompany her observations on the \u201CProphet\u201D Mohammed cartoon.\
  \ Indeed, so grumpy did I become that I could only becalm myself by mooing like\
  \ a cow, which I am given to understand is a proven relaxation technique peddled\
  \ by stress counsellors. I mooed the afternoon away, and so intensely did I immerse\
  \ myself in cowdom that, at dusk, I found myself standing in a field, staring blankly\
  \ at nothing, while gnats and midges hovered in the air around me.\nWhile I was\
  \ thus engaged, Antipodean Hooting Yard researcher Glyn Webster made better use\
  \ of his time. He has devised an extremely helpful Table Of Non-Bl\xF6tzmann Smileys\
  \ which is reproduced below. Mr Webster has suggested that it may be possible for\
  \ a boffin to tinker with the WordPress software to make these the default symbols\
  \ for Hooting Yard and, while I do not encourage the use of them at all, this is\
  \ well worth looking into.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\
