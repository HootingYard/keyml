text: "Madam Galvani observed convulsions in a dead frog, which laid near an electrical\
  \ machine which was in action. Although there is a diversity of information as to\
  \ whether it was she or a student who noticed the incident first. As she is said\
  \ to have been an invalid, and the frogs were for her benefit, it is more than likely\
  \ she had an eye on them, and it would not be strange if they both saw the convulsions\
  \ at the same time. However, the subject was investigated by Dr. Galvani, who was\
  \ a Professor of Anatomy, and they found that. a knife touched the frog, and that\
  \ when a metallic substance in contact with a nerve of the creature, was brought\
  \ within the action of the electrical machine, there followed a twitching of the\
  \ limb. And since that time a great many discoveries have been made about all this,\
  \ and a machine constructed, called the Galvanic Battery; the principle of it, being\
  \ that when two metals are connected by some substance capable of exciting their\
  \ different electricities, similar effects to these described may be observed. Charges\
  \ from the battery will occasion contortions and violent jerkings in dead corpses,\
  \ which are rather horrible to witness. After the skin has been removed from the\
  \ hind legs of frogs and some salt sprinkled over them, (while they are raw of course),\
  \ the legs will quiver and jerk in a curious manner, occasioned by the action of\
  \ the salt upon them. It is likely that Madam Galvani was going to have the frogs\
  \ for her dinner. They have a taste between fish and chicken; you broil them over\
  \ the fire, and then put a little sprinkle of salt, and the least dust of pepper,\
  \ if any at all, then you will have delicious morsels. It is not necessary to cook\
  \ them out of doors; building fires is a dangerous employment for children, and\
  \ if you ever have any, bring them into the kitchen, and do the cooking there, where\
  \ you can get help if you should need it. A word more about that pepper. Pepper,\
  \ spice and other irritants, should be used with caution, if used at all, for the\
  \ effect of them is to excite the coating of the stomach, and lead eventually to\
  \ disease. In concluding about the battery alluded to, it is capable of producing\
  \ great quantities of electricity; there is a positive pole and a negative pole,\u2014\
  the positive pole attracts a negative pole, and a negative pole attracts a positive\
  \ pole. These terms, positive and negative, express different quantities of the\
  \ fluid, positive being more, and the negative less. The term pole, in this connection,\
  \ meaning point; point of concentration. Exactly how the metals are arranged in\
  \ a pile, and the vessels with acid and water, and so on, are adjusted, is explained\
  \ in works on the subject. We have learned so much of the ways of electricity, that\
  \ we cannot be surprised as our predecessors were, even if dead bodies jerk and\
  \ thump around. They have, by tracing remarkable phenomena, which astonished them,\
  \ elucidated them and placed them where they belong, under and within this property\
  \ of matter.\nfrom Properties And Powers In Every-Day Matters by A Corey (1876),\
  \ as noted in Odd Books\_: A Safe House For Literary Misfits, which is highly recommended.\n\
