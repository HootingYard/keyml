text: "Browsing in a bookshop the other day, I noticed among the new titles a considerable\
  \ number of books about \u201CThe New China\u201D. I have not read any of them,\
  \ and did not buy any of them, but I have nevertheless been thinking about The New\
  \ China and how it might differ from The Old China.\nI began by wondering if I could\
  \ gain a grasp of the matter by comparing New Labour with Old Labour. A moment's\
  \ reflection, however, dissuaded me from going down that path. First, The New China\
  \ clearly has a definite article, whereas my researches have shown that nowhere\
  \ was New Labour ever referred to as The New Labour. Second, while New Labour supplanted\
  \ Old Labour, it has in itself now been replaced by, variously, Blue Labour, New\
  \ Old Labour, or simply Labour. As far as I have been able to ascertain, this has\
  \ not yet happened to The New China, which remains The New China in opposition to\
  \ The Old China.\nThere is one remarkable similarity, and one glaring difference,\
  \ between The New China and The Old China. (I am sure there are more, of each, but\
  \ these two instances will suffice to get us to the nub. The nub, after all, is\
  \ where we want to be, whether it be The New Nub or The Old Nub, or just The Nub,)\n\
  The similarity is this. To a large extent, one will find that the rivers and the\
  \ mountains of The New China are almost exactly the same as those of The Old China.\
  \ There may be the occasional small variation, but nothing a geographer of any stripe\
  \ would deem significant. (I will be writing about the stripes of geographers, in\
  \ another context, shortly.)\nOn the other hand, the people of The Old China have\
  \ been completely replaced by new people in The New China. If we pluck a year of\
  \ The Old China at random\u2014say 1736\u2014we find that every single one of those\
  \ Old Chinese people is gone, and also that not one of the New Chinese people has\
  \ yet arrived on the scene.\nIt is of course possible to posit a very different\
  \ kind of The New China, where all the mountains and rivers have been replaced by\
  \ new ones, whereas the people are the same. They would be staggering about, withered\
  \ and wizened and toothless and doolally, without a clue where they were, their\
  \ familiar landmarks, the rivers and mountains, changed, and changed utterly, in\
  \ The New China.\n[2014-11-16]"
