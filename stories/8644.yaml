text: "It came as something of a shock when I learned that my fate was written in\
  \ the stars. I had no idea that every last particular of my life, from cradle to\
  \ grave, was foretold in the barely visible movements, thousands and millions of\
  \ miles away, of fiery burning rocks scattered across the sky. As soon as I learned\
  \ this, I was avid to know what lay in store for me. Only then did I realise that\
  \ I could not read the stars, so I went to consult a stargazer.\nHe ushered me in\
  \ to his observatory, high on a promontory, and tapped a spindly finger on the end\
  \ of his telescope. He bade me peer through it, and I saw manifold stars, impossibly\
  \ distant, burning bright in the night sky.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D I said, \u201CHow\
  \ lovely they are. Yet to me, senseless, devoid of meaning.\u201D\n\u201CThat is\
  \ where I come in,\u201D he said, lighting his pipe and puffing on it with the air\
  \ of a great sage. Then he faffed about with some gubbins and projected the image\
  \ seen through the telescope on to a canvas screen.\n\u201CSee this star?\u201D\
  , he said, pointing with a pointy stick at one bright twinkle among the myriad,\
  \ \u201CThis is your guiding star.\u201D\nI could only say \u201CGosh!\u201D again.\n\
  \u201CThe official name of this star is B76428\u2013552,\u201D he said, \u201CBut\
  \ that is a dull as ditchwater name for a star, so, as with other stars, we give\
  \ it a more memorable nickname.\u201D\n\u201CAnd what is the nickname of my guiding\
  \ star?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CWe call it Fascist Groove Thang,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  It is among a cluster of stars nicknamed after pop records made thirty-odd years\
  \ ago, when it was first observed through my mighty telescope. I have kept a careful\
  \ eye on it ever since. That is how I knew you would come to visit me in my observatory\
  \ today, though I must have misread the signs and portents, for you arrived ten\
  \ minutes later than I expected.\u201D\n\u201CAh,\u201D I said, \u201CThe delay\
  \ was on account of important roadworks at the Blister Lane Bypass. My bus was diverted\
  \ down a side road rife with lupins.\u201D\nThe stargazer puffed his pipe, even\
  \ more sagely.\n\u201CStill, that is a conundrum, and one I must puzzle out. The\
  \ stars ought to have foretold the important roadworks. They almost certainly did.\
  \ Much more likely that I somehow misread the signs and portents. I am getting a\
  \ bit slapdash in my dotage, and my eyesight is no longer what it was. Once it was\
  \ piercing, like a hawk.\u201D\nI commiserated with him, recommended some proprietary\
  \ eye-drops, and then begged him to reveal what the stars told him about my future.\
  \ He used the pointy stick to describe arcs and angles across the screen, and finally\
  \ pointed once again at Fascist Groove Thang, so bright! so twinkly!\n\u201CWell,\
  \ Ivan Denisovich,\u201D he said, \u201CIt seems that next Thursday, you will meet\
  \ a tall, dark stranger, you may have a stroke of good luck, and an opportunity\
  \ may arise at work. Also, there may be an incident involving a dog, or possibly\
  \ a tortoise.\u201D\n\u201CWow!\u201D I said, \u201CThe person who told me that\
  \ my fate was laid out in detail in the stars obviously knew what they were talking\
  \ about. That's four things that will happen on just one day of my allotted span.\u201D\
  \nThe stargazer's countenance suddenly darkened. He took a long, sage, puff on his\
  \ pipe and he frowned.\n\u201CI hope you do not intend to ask me, as some others\
  \ have done, what is writ upon the stars regarding the precise duration of your\
  \ allotted span,\u201D he said.\nNow, call me a fathead, but the blindingly obvious\
  \ had not even occurred to me. Of course, if my fate were foretold, that would include\
  \ the date and indeed the circumstances of my death.\n\u201CActually, no,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CRight this minute I am more concerned about this business with the\
  \ tortoise next Thursday.\u201D\nThe stargazer relaxed.\n\u201CI did not say it\
  \ would necessarily be a tortoise. I said there might\u2014might\u2014be an incident\
  \ involving a dog or a tortoise.\u201D\n\u201CWell,\u201D I said, \u201CCould you\
  \ not peer a bit harder, or describe slightly more precise arcs and angles with\
  \ your pointy stick, or do whatever it takes to read my guiding star, Fascist Groove\
  \ Thang, more closely? I would really like to know if there definitely will be an\
  \ incident, and if so, whether a dog or a tortoise will be involved.\u201D\nAnd\
  \ I meant it. This is not the place to explain my preoccupation with tortoises\u2014\
  particularly with Thursday tortoises\u2014but it is very real, and exhausting, and\
  \ occasionally almost fatal.\n\u201CI can draw up a chart,\u201D said the stargazer,\
  \ \u201CWhich will break next Thursday down into ten-minute chunks. I will have\
  \ to observe Fascist Groove Thang more closely, through an even more powerful telescope,\
  \ in an even bigger observatory upon an even higher promontory. But if that is what\
  \ you wish, so be it. Bear in mind that the chart will be unintelligible to one\
  \ with such a puny brain as yours, so I will have to interpret it for you. And of\
  \ course one must always take account of the vicissitudes of cloud cover. But I\
  \ think I should be able to come up with a definitive narrative of events, rich\
  \ in detail, including even the name of the tortoise, if it turns out there is a\
  \ tortoise involved in the incident, if of course there is an incident.\u201D\n\u201C\
  That would be dandy,\u201D I said, and I forked over the stargazer's hefty fee.\n\
  But would it be dandy? Bitter experience told me that tortoises on Thursday spelled\
  \ ruination and destruction of all my hopes, ever since that picnicking fiasco in\
  \ Shoeburyness. The less said about it the better, if I wished to retain my sanity.\
  \ I went to sit in the stargazer's waiting room, while he pootled off to a bigger\
  \ observatory on a higher promontory. He had not told me how long it would take\
  \ him to read my fate in the stars, but he said that if I went and peered through\
  \ his telescope at Fascist Groove Thang from time to time, I might be able to discern\
  \ the signs and portents of his return, and the cast of his countenance, and whether\
  \ the news he brought back with him was good, or bad, or worse\u2026 even fatal.\n\
  He has been gone now for six days. Tomorrow is Thursday. I have no idea what tidings\
  \ he will bring, for all I have seen through his telescope is a scattering across\
  \ the sky of burning fiery rocks, impossibly distant, devoid of meaning, senseless,\
  \ senseless.\n[2012-03-12]"
