text: "One of the incidental pleasures of reading the long-forgotten memoirs of obscure\
  \ figures from our island history is to stumble upon fleeting mentions of that gruesome\
  \ ogre of children's nightmares, the Grunty Man. All of us, I think, can recall\
  \ the shiver that ran down our spine when we sat at mama's knee and she read to\
  \ us tales of the fearsome Grunty Man, lurking in his cave and occasionally emerging\
  \ into the light to grunt and grunt and lay waste the earth and grunt some more.\
  \ Now we are grown we can look back with fondness on this loathsome fantastical\
  \ creature, safe in the knowledge that he never really existed \u2026 or did he?\n\
  The other day, I was reading the long-forgotten memoirs of an obscure figure in\
  \ our island history, the expatriate Hollander Joost Van Dongelbraacke. It is an\
  \ unfathomably dull book, or I should say books, for Van Dongelbraacke managed to\
  \ eke seven fat closely-printed volumes from what was, by any measure, a fairly\
  \ uneventful life. I love this stuff and could read it until the cows come home.\
  \ I was about half-way through volume three when, to my delight and consternation,\
  \ I came upon this passage:\nAt luncheon that day I ate a goodly amount of My Lady\
  \ Kent's Pudding, but it had not been sufficiently boiled, or perhaps it had been\
  \ boiled for too long, for shortly after digesting my third bowl-ful I suffered\
  \ the most terrible mortification of the bowels and had to be carried from my place\
  \ by the servants and deposited on an an ottoman in the smoking room where I moaned\
  \ weakly and cursed heaven. Thereafter, to make recompense, when I was able to move\
  \ I repaired to my private chapel and offered orisons to the Almighty that he might\
  \ spare me from the horrors inflicted by skittish cooks.\nI then determined to berate\
  \ said cook, and had her summoned from the pantry, only to be told she was not to\
  \ be found there. I strongly suspected her of being involved in unseemly canoodling\
  \ with Mr Snippage, the gardener, and so I pulled on my out of doors boots and went\
  \ striding through the grounds, past the filbert hedges and towards the ha-ha, where\
  \ Snippage had his hut. While I was walking thus, waving my stick, I caught a fleeting\
  \ glimpse of the Grunty Man, darting between the elms.\nWhen I reached the hut I\
  \ banged my fist on the door, hoping to disturb the gardener and the cook. But there\
  \ was no response, and when I opened the door to peer inside, I found the hut was\
  \ empty. My mood was now tempestuous, so on my way back to the house I berated one\
  \ of the estate peasants who was pushing a wheelbarrow full of dead toads from one\
  \ pond to another. Shouting my head off did me the world of good.\nBack in the house,\
  \ I settled in the library and spent a profitable hour reading a collection of sermons\
  \ by Parson Freakpit. Outside the sky was louring and there were hints of English\
  \ drizzle. I closed the book and thought longingly of the canals of my homeland.\
  \ These thoughts were interrupted by a servant who came to inform me that the cook\
  \ and Mr Snippage had been seen boarding the mail coach heading for the coast. I\
  \ cursed heaven once again, kicked the servant all the way along the corridor, and,\
  \ feeling a renewed mortification of the bowels, shut myself in the Thunder Box\
  \ until it was time for supper.\nFor supper that day I ate a goodly amount of My\
  \ Lady Kent's Pudding.\n[2016-02-21]"
