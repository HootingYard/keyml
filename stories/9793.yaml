text: "Here comes the Krummhorn Man.\n  He's had a palaver.\n  He has to solve acrostics\
  \ for his mother.\n  She is blind, and so is her dog.\n  The dog's name is Spinach.\n\
  \  Spinach is a good name for a dog.\n  That's what mother thinks.\n  She is ninety\
  \ now, and every domestic pet she has ever had since she was a tiny tot she has\
  \ called Spinach.\n  The donkey, the hamster, a kitten, several goldfish, certain\
  \ other types of fish, rabbits and budgerigars, all Spinaches.\n  This might be\
  \ called monomania.\n  The Krummhorn Man looks kindly upon his mother.\n  He is\
  \ a good son.\nTake a look at him now, a shopping list scrunched in his fist, prancing\
  \ up the street.\n  He is on his way to the butcher's.\n  The butcher is a caution.\n\
  \  He's Cyclopean and bears duelling scars.\n  Lit by the moon, he howls, a proper\
  \ butcher's howl.\n  He keeps a vase of peonies on his mantel.\n  Oh for campions\
  \ and oxlips!\n  Today it is sausages for the Krummhorn Man.\n  The sausages have\
  \ the name of an English county.\n  The butcher, the butcher, the butcher with his\
  \ meat-cleaver.\n  How sharp it is, and fearsome.\n  He whets the blade on a whetstone\
  \ behind his kiosk.\n  You can hear the scree scree scree before dawn.\n  He wakes\
  \ the town.\nSausages bought, on goes the Krummhorn Man, past the haberdasher and\
  \ the aquarium.\n  Past all things.\n  Out into the gorse and nettles, followed\
  \ by geese.\n  Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\n  But he is not pied and he has\
  \ no pipe and it is not Hamelin.\n  It is an English county with the same name as\
  \ the sausages.\n  Or it might be, if things fit neatly together.\n  He pops a boiled\
  \ sweet into his mouth.\n  It is a spangle.\n  Invisible threads bind him to the\
  \ past.\n  He smacks his lips.\n  The sound alerts an otter.\n  The Krummhorn Man\
  \ shook off the geese and now he has an otter.\n  He sits down by the river.\n \
  \ He has to solve acrostics for his mother.\nThe wind is fair, the wind is foul.\n\
  \  The Krummhorn Man throws in the towel.\n  It is carried downstream towards the\
  \ sea.\n  The otter follows him back to mother.\n  Dog and otter in mother's parlour.\n\
  \  The one blind, the other not.\n  What a palaver.\nUmbilically linked as once\
  \ he was he makes a pot of tea.\n  He ties a knot in a dishcloth and chucks it out\
  \ of the window.\n  And here comes Mister Snippage, toiling along the lane.\n  He\
  \ is lame and pale and valiant.\n  What ho, what ho.\n  And tally tally ho too.\n\
  \  Then the Krummhorn Man makes himself scarce.\n  He takes himself to a place of\
  \ defeat.\n  He leaves the sausages on the kitchen counter.\nWhere would he be if\
  \ he were not here?\n  Over the sea and in a capital city loud with life.\n  Churning\
  \ up the churnable, sparks and pangs, wearing a hat at a jaunty angle, getting into\
  \ tangles, bumping things.\n  He peers into the distance through the mist.\n  The\
  \ glue factory has closed down.\n  He keeps one arm in a sling for old time's sake.\n\
  \  He was once the invalids\u2019 invalid, just as the butcher is the butchers\u2019\
  \ butcher.\n  It says so on a sign on his wall.\n  There is a red wax seal embossed\
  \ on it of heraldic significance.\n  Red wax too in the Krummhorn Man's hair.\n\
  \  A barber put it there for a prank.\n  Little gobbets, tiny orbs.\n  He is a very\
  \ peculiar barber, shunned by many, and that is no surprise.\n  The barber is down\
  \ a way from the butcher and the haberdasher and the aquarium, and around a corner,\
  \ ever in shadow.\n  It is where they hold table-rapping meetings, with ectoplasm.\n\
  \  The Krummhorn Man sought his father there.\n  He is a good son.\nHedges flank\
  \ the abandoned glue factory.\n  They have not been snipped for many a spring.\n\
  \  It is a place to pine.\n  There are still nozzles to be seen among the ruins.\n\
  \  The Krummhorn Man has his favourites.\n  He has snapped thousands of photographs\
  \ with a long lens.\n  He used to use a Polaroid.\n  Polaroids and polar bears and\
  \ polar wastes, he kept them together in his head.\n  It was a nice head, mother\
  \ said.\n  It was the colour of curd.\n  The otter was gone from the parlour when\
  \ he went back, bent on his sausages.\n  The fat sizzled in the pan.\nJust then\
  \ Mister Snippage came toiling back along the lane and began to pound on the door\
  \ with his great hairy fists.\n  Spinach dragged his ancient canine bones to the\
  \ doormat and dribbled.\n  At the same time the telephone rang and an alarm sounded.\n\
  \  It was pandaemonium.\n  The hospital helicopter was circling overhead.\n  There\
  \ was gunfire coming from the hills.\n  It turned out to be a mock emergency, staged\
  \ by actors.\n  Even Mister Snippage was not really Mister Snippage at all.\n  His\
  \ part was played by an elfin amateur caked in makeup.\n  The sausages were burned\
  \ black.\nSee, see, the Krummhorn Man has set out again, in the rain, in the rain.\n\
  \  This time he has taken a pipe.\n  Its bowl is in the lee of the brim of his hat\
  \ so the rain does not douse it.\n  But the shutters are down at the butcher's shop.\n\
  \  The butcher is gone for the day.\n  Where is he gone to?\n  That is what everyone\
  \ is asking, in a huddle at his door.\n  Then the band strikes up that old traditional\
  \ air \u201CButcher, Butcher, Where Have You Been?\u201D\n  But until he comes back\
  \ they will be in the dark.\nButcher, butcher, where have you been?\n  Until I come\
  \ back you will be in the dark.\n  Butcher, butcher, what have you seen?\n  I have\
  \ seen a swan in a pond in the park.\n  Butcher, butcher, why is it dark?\n  Because\
  \ the shutters are down on my shop on the street.\n  Butcher, butcher, will you\
  \ ever come back?\n  I shall return with contaminated meat.\nThe Krummhorn Man goes\
  \ home sausageless in the downpour.\n  He must solve acrostics for his mother.\n\
  \  Spinach is asleep in front of the fire.\n  He is dreaming a dog dream of triumph\
  \ and vinegar.\n[2012-08-02]"
