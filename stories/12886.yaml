text: "A letter arrives from Tim Thurn:\nHey there, Mr Key!\_: Every so often over\
  \ the years you have made mention of a snack or breakfast item called \u201Csmokers\u2019\
  \ poptarts\u201D. I don't smoke myself\u2014it's a filthy habit and you ought to\
  \ be roundly ashamed of yourself\u2014but I must confess that whenever I read about\
  \ what I assume to be poptarts specifically designed for smokers I find myself salivating.\
  \ It can be quite embarrassing, for I usually read Hooting Yard when travelling\
  \ on public transport, and on more than one occasion I have been found drooling\
  \ spittle over a fellow-passenger. I have been mistaken for an indigent, and beaten\
  \ about the head with a rolled-up copy of The Daily Incandescent Bus Passenger.\n\
  Obviously my response to the words \u201Csmokers\u2019 poptarts\u201D is irrational,\
  \ as if I were a Pavlovian dog. I have been led to delve into my family history\
  \ to discover whether there is something nameless and awful lurking in my genetic\
  \ heritage. Thus far I have gone back as far as the sixteenth century without finding\
  \ anything pertinent, though obviously there were numerous smokers among my ancestors,\
  \ for time was when seemingly everybody smoked, all the time. What a disgusting\
  \ world it was!\nAnyway, back to the present day, or to be more precise the recent\
  \ past, the very recent past, actually the Thursday just gone. Although you have\
  \ not mentioned smokers\u2019 poptarts for quite a while, I have\u2014as you may\
  \ have guessed\u2014become obsessed with them. Standing at the bus stop on Thursday\
  \ morning, wobbling my head gently from side to side and up and down in a futile\
  \ attempt to empty it of thoughts of you know what, I suddenly felt impelled, as\
  \ if by some eldritch force, to cave into my longings and to damn well go and buy\
  \ a packet of smokers\u2019 poptarts and wolf them down, there and then.\nDo you\
  \ know what? I could not find a single shop, in the great metropolis of Pointy Town,\
  \ that sold them! I tried bakeries, pastry shops, general grocers, supermarkets,\
  \ hypermarkets, corner shops, charity shops, snackbars, picnic shops, and many another\
  \ type of shop, and from each one I tottered out empty-handed and increasingly desperate.\
  \ Also, I missed my bus.\nI realise I am on the verge of doolallydom, if not already\
  \ there, and that the proper response to that terrible morning would have been to\
  \ plunge my head repeatedly into a bucket of icy water and then have a lie down\
  \ in a darkened room for several days. A sensible man would have done that, but\
  \ I am no longer a sensible man. That is why I am writing to you, imploring you,\
  \ beseeching you, like a grubby mendicant sprawled at the feet of a potentate, to\
  \ provide me with the recipe, so I can make my own smokers\u2019 poptarts, in my\
  \ own kitchen, and stuff them down my gob until I am sick. That, I think, Mr Key,\
  \ is my one remaining hope on this earth.\nYours in extremis, Tim Thurn\nTim might\
  \ find it helpful to track down a copy of Dobson's pamphlet How To Make Your Own\
  \ Packet Of Half A Dozen Smokers\u2019 Poptarts For Tuppence-Ha'penny (out of print).\
  \ It is many years now since I have seen a copy, but as I recall the pamphleteer\
  \ gives a jaunty account of his own muckings about in the kitchen with stuff like\
  \ flour and suet and duckpond water and rolling pins and greaseproof paper and the\
  \ Lord knows what else.\n[2014-07-30]"
