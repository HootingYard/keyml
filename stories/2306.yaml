text: "The Islamic chaplain at Yale University says there is \u201Cgreat wisdom\u201D\
  \ in the idea of putting to death those who leave his religion. I suspect he may\
  \ need to have his brain tampered with, or at least be given a dictionary so that\
  \ he can learn the meaning of \u201Cwisdom\u201D. Here, for example, is a proper\
  \ example of great wisdom from Mick Hartley:\n\u201CIn these dark days it's somehow\
  \ comforting to think that someone, somewhere, has been spending their time fitting\
  \ eye-patches on bees.\u201D\nIt is indeed.\n[2009-04-17]"
