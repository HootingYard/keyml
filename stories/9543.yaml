text: "I have a picture postcard of the Old Town of Prague, on the reverse of which\
  \ there is printed a quotation from \u201CThe Dairies Of Franz Kafka\u201D. For\
  \ many years, in fact until yesterday, I assumed this was a misprint. It was only\
  \ when I conducted some mopping up research into the whole business of Dobson and\
  \ his Country Diary that I realised I had misread some of the paperwork. My source\
  \ material actually referred to Dobson's Country Dairy. This leads me to wonder\
  \ if the picture postcard is indeed correct, and Franz Kafka, too, had his own dairy\
  \ in the Bohemian countryside, over which his biographers have drawn a veil. I will\
  \ look into this matter in due course, but for the time being, while I still have\
  \ these masses of Dobsonia strewn around my boudoir, I think it best to winkle out\
  \ what facts I can about the titanic pamphleteer's dairy.\nApparently, one windy\
  \ March morning in the early nineteen-fifties, Dobson made a sudden announcement\
  \ at breakfast. He and his poppet, Marigold Chew, were in the midst of an experimental\
  \ breakfast phase at the time, what with postwar rationing, and were tucking into\
  \ boiled viper-heads on toast. Suddenly, Dobson put down his fork, finished chewing,\
  \ swallowed, and said:\n\u201CGod Almighty, I've had it up to here with this pamphleteering\
  \ lark! I am out of print and nobody cares what I have to say about any topic under\
  \ the sun. I think I shall retire to the countryside and surround myself with goats.\u201D\
  \n\u201CAnglo Nubian, Toggenburg, Golden Guernsey, or Bagot?\u201D asked Marigold\
  \ Chew, raising an eyebrow.\n\u201CI beg your pardon?\u201D said Dobson, who had\
  \ no idea what she was talking about.\n\u201CI am wondering which types of goats\
  \ you intend to surround yourself with,\u201D said Marigold Chew. Then, noting that\
  \ Dobson's countenance was expressive of the most profound bafflement, she added,\
  \ \u201CThose are the names of four breeds of goat. There are others, but I did\
  \ not wish to overstimulate your brain and have it explode so early in the morn.\u201D\
  \ It was five-thirty, and the sun had not yet risen.\n\u201CIn my world, a goat\
  \ is a goat,\u201D said Dobson, and he left the breakfast table to go rummaging\
  \ in a pile of old magazines, one of which be brought back triumphantly.\n\u201C\
  I knew I had this somewhere,\u201D he said, \u201CIt's The Listener, Vol I, No 16,\
  \ 1st May 1929, and I kept it because it has a very interesting article by H S Holmes\
  \ Pegler on goat-keeping. Listen to this. Many people have a prejudice against goat's\
  \ milk, thinking it has a peculiarly goaty flavour. This misapprehension has probably\
  \ arisen from the experience of tourists in Switzerland and Italy where goat's milk\
  \ is in common use, and frequently offered in mugs or glasses which have not been\
  \ properly cleaned.\u201D\n\u201CAnd your point is?\u201D asked Marigold Chew.\n\
  \u201CMy point is,\u201D said Dobson, becoming exasperated, \u201CThat if I retire\
  \ to the countryside and surround myself with goats, I can serve their milk to tourists\
  \ in properly cleaned mugs or glasses and thus demonstrate that goat's milk does\
  \ not have a peculiarly goaty flavour. It's a guaranteed money-spinner. Tourists\
  \ will shun Switzerland and Italy with their goaty flavoured goat's milk and throng\
  \ to the Dobson Countryside Goat Dairy instead!\u201D\nSo feverish with excitement\
  \ was the pamphleteer that, leaving half a slice of toast and a boiled viper-head\
  \ untouched, he leapt up again from the breakfast table, donned his Panamanian Canal\
  \ Inspector's boots, and crashed out of the door into a downpour. He caught the\
  \ first bus of the new day into the countryside, alighting at a godforsaken spot\
  \ on a blasted heath. It was desolate and windswept and foul, but in his mind's\
  \ eye Dobson saw a gleaming space age dairy with his name emblazoned over the gates,\
  \ and happy goats frolicking and gambolling, and queues of tourists lining up to\
  \ purchase properly cleaned mugs or glasses of non-goaty flavoured goat's milk.\
  \ The rain had stopped, briefly, and Dobson sat down on a stone and lit a cigarette\
  \ and pondered his next step. The first thing to do, he decided, was to obtain some\
  \ goats.\nDobson waited several hours before a countryside person hove into view,\
  \ toiling across the heath with a pitchfork over his shoulder.\n\u201CHail, peasant!\u201D\
  \ cried Dobson, \u201CTell me, where is the nearest goat shop?\u201D\nThe rustic\
  \ squinted at him.\n\u201CWhat sort of goats would you be after, sir?\u201D he asked.\n\
  \u201CIn my world, a goat is a goat,\u201D said Dobson for the second time that\
  \ day.\n\u201CThat's as may be, sir,\u201D said the peasant, pausing to flick bits\
  \ of muck off the ends of his pitchfork with horny fingernails, \u201CBut I'd have\
  \ to know whether you want Anglo Nubians or Toggenburgs or Golden Guernseys or Bagots\
  \ before deciding which direction to point you in. But choose your goat, and point\
  \ you I will, through copse or spinney, past brook or rill.\u201D\n\u201CIs that\
  \ some kind of rustic saying?\u201D\n\u201CIt is sir, countryside wisdom, hard won,\
  \ and ancient, and timeless.\u201D\n\u201CLook,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CIt's really\
  \ very simple. I just want to buy a goat. Or several goats. I don't care what type\
  \ of goats they are.\u201D\n\u201CBeware the man who chooses no goat,\u201D said\
  \ the peasant, and he brandished his pitchfork with some menace.\n\u201CIs that\
  \ another rustic saying?\u201D snapped Dobson. But it was a rhetorical question,\
  \ and before the peasant could answer, the pamphleteer turned away and began trudging\
  \ across the blasted heath as the clouds burst and rain began to fall again. Not\
  \ for the first time, Dobson felt defeated by the countryside. By the time he reached\
  \ home, hours and hours later, he had abandoned the idea of running a goat dairy.\n\
  \u201CI am going to have another crack at pamphleteering,\u201D he told Marigold\
  \ Chew, and, still sopping wet, he sat slumped at his escritoire and wrote the opening\
  \ lines of his pamphlet Let Tourists Go To Switzerland And Italy And Drink Goaty\
  \ Flavoured Goat's Milk From Improperly Cleaned Mugs And Glasses, And See If I Care!\
