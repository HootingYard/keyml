text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tzipi Blankette, again, Thank you very much for the helpful\
  \ information about the little stint. I now wish to raise a completely unrelated\
  \ matter. I read with great interest your piece on the feeding of a pigtape, and\
  \ I find myself in something of a quandary. I would very much like to obtain a pet\
  \ pigtape for my tiny infant, Bathsheba, but I have been told in no uncertain terms\
  \ by a number of religious and spiritual authorities that she does not have a soul.\
  \ One particularly forbidding Jesuit announced, in a booming voice, that little\
  \ Bathsheba is the spawn of the devil. Apparently, it is rare for a baby to be born\
  \ with vivid markings resembling the number 666 emblazoned atop their skull. Now\
  \ she is some six years of age, her hair has grown and the markings are no longer\
  \ visible, but Father Tonguelash S.J. says this makes no difference.\nSpawn of the\
  \ devil or no, it does seem to be the case that Bathsheba is soulless, for her innards\
  \ have been examined with probes, plungers, x-ray scanners, and geothermal imaging\
  \ systems, and in among all the bones and veins and tissue and sinew and liver and\
  \ lights etcetera there is indeed no sign of anything resembling a soul, which as\
  \ we know is about the size and shape and colour of a plum tomato, though intangible\
  \ and shimmering and glorious and immortal in a way that a plum tomato is not. That\
  \ being so, Bathsheba has no suitable home in which a pigtape might nest, but I\
  \ so want her to have one, especially now she is going to kindergarten. You know\
  \ what children are like, and I fear she will be teased mercilessly.\nPlease let\
  \ me know if there is any advice you can give a poor addled parent at this difficult\
  \ time. Yours even more sincerely than yesterday, Tzipi Blankette.\nWell, Tzipi,\
  \ I suggest you ignore the Jesuits and just go ahead and buy a pigtape for your\
  \ daughter. Most townlets have a pigtape supplier, usually located down one of the\
  \ less salubrious alleyways near the railway station. Pigtapes may need a few days\
  \ to acclimatise themselves to their new environment. Set aside a small nook or\
  \ cranny in your home to settle the pigtape in, and before bringing it home lay\
  \ out plenty of newspaper and throw the windows open. Place in the nook a small\
  \ box or carton, lined with a scrap of fabric taken from a piece of clothing worn\
  \ by its new owner, in this case Bathsheba. Some wool from one of her bonnets would\
  \ be ideal. To help the pigtape get used to its new surroundings, avoid making loud\
  \ noises or sudden movements in the vicinity of the carton. When it has had a few\
  \ days to adjust, you can introduce it to Bathsheba gently, for two or three minutes\
  \ at a time. If she is clutching in her little fist a leaf of lettuce, a radish,\
  \ or some breadcrumbs, all the better. It is also a good idea to put out a saucer\
  \ in which you can pour the dregs from a can of Squelcho!, but make sure Bathsheba\
  \ doesn't lap this up herself. After a few days, or weeks, or months, or in some\
  \ cases even years, the pigtape will be thoroughly at home, and will creep, grunting,\
  \ to its permanent nest, or sty, when you are not looking.\nNOTE\_: Mr Key wishes\
  \ to thank Miss Dimity Cashew for her help with pigtape advice.\n[2011-07-31]"
