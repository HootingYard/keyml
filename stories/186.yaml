text: "Dobson was a great collector of coupons. Almost all coupons are redeemable\
  \ in one form or another, but not in Dobson's world. \u201CDo not even think of\
  \ urging me to redeem any of my coupons!\u201D he shouted, more than once, when\
  \ it was gently suggested to him that he was sitting on a fortune in unredeemed\
  \ coupons. Curiously, for a man so attached to the written word, the pamphleteer\
  \ preferred coupons with minimal or no wording, and those which were beige in colour.\
  \ Another thing he used to say, or to shout, was \u201CI cannot be doing with flimsy\
  \ coupons made of paper!\u201D He never said so explicitly, but for Dobson the Ur-coupon\
  \ was a small, blank, beige, rectangular piece of cardboard.\nA few years ago I\
  \ was sitting in a snackbar when something curious happened. Some would say the\
  \ mere fact of me sitting in the half-civilised air of a snackbar is curiosity enough,\
  \ given that I am more usually to be found sprawled in a ditch or languishing louchely\
  \ in a damp and derelict farmyard outhouse, but stay with me on this one, if you\
  \ will. I would rather not explain what I was doing tucking into a snack in a snackbar\
  \ in mid-afternoon on a Tuesday, togged out in what I have to say was a rather fetching\
  \ Lord Summerisle yellow polo neck and drainpipe trousers combination. Granted,\
  \ I do not have the bouffant sported so majestically by Christopher Lee in The Wicker\
  \ Man, and perhaps there was rather a lot of straw snagged in my hair, together\
  \ with the odd beetle, but all I can say is that I cut a pretty dashing figure.\
  \ My surroundings probably had something to do with it, as it was a bloody fantastic\
  \ snackbar, all things considered.\nAnyway, I was chomping my way through my snack\
  \ when the man behind the counter began to sing. It was not a song I knew. The verses\
  \ seemed to consist mostly of extracts from the Book of Isaiah. There was a bit\
  \ that went \u201Che is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep;\
  \ Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba\u201D which I recognised, but it was\
  \ when the snackbar tenor got to the chorus that my ears really pricked up. \u201C\
  Yea, and I shall wash myself in the blood of the Lamb, and plead with the Lord,\
  \ to get me a small, blank, beige, rectangular piece of cardboard,\u201D he sang.\n\
  This was extraordinary. This was a song about the out of print pamphleteer's Ur-coupon!\
  \ Could Dobson have written it himself? I choked on my potted paste pie and leapt\
  \ to my feet. For a second I wondered if the gasps from an adjoining table meant\
  \ that I was not the only Dobsonist to frequent this snackbar, but then I realised\
  \ that my neighbours were gazing awestruck at my winklepickers. Who can blame them?\
  \ I flashed a rakish smile, a beetle dropped from my hair, and I lolloped elegantly\
  \ over to the counter.\n\u201CI gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them\
  \ that plucked off the hair,\u201D the man was singing now, but I held up my hand\
  \ and stopped him.\n\u201CTell me,\u201D I drawled, not wanting to sound too excited,\
  \ \u201CWhat is that song you are singing?\u201D The man held up a little sign informing\
  \ me that he was deaf as a post, so I repeated my question using the only sign language\
  \ I know, which is a version of the Bl\xF6tzmann system that I learned as a youth\
  \ in the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift movement. Luckily the stone deaf singer knew\
  \ it too. Later, he was to explain to me that he had not learned the system in the\
  \ Kibbo Kift, but, to my astonishment, directly from Bl\xF6tzmann himself, shortly\
  \ before that towering figure was blown up in the Hindenberg.\nIf one can jabber\
  \ in sign language, we jabbered. Ten minutes in, by which time I was leaning as\
  \ insouciantly as I could against the counter, the better to show off my poise,\
  \ the snackbar singer broke off from our conversation to harry the rest of the snackers\
  \ out into the wind and the rain. He slammed the door shut as the last one left,\
  \ locked it with a surprisingly enormous key, and pulled down the blinds. Then he\
  \ took me into a back room, beyond the kitchen and the pantry, and we settled ourselves\
  \ in for what I can only describe as a Dobsonathon. It's not a pretty word, but\
  \ I can't think how else to describe a discussion that continued, virtually uninterrupted,\
  \ for the next four days.\nIt turned out that my new pal was an autodidact who had,\
  \ for the past decade, devoted himself to getting to the bottom of this thing Dobson\
  \ had about coupons. It was a narrow speciality, to be sure, but the world needs\
  \ people like him. He confessed that he was completely uninterested in the bulk\
  \ of the pamphleteer's pamphlets, had never read them and never intended to, and\
  \ indeed could not care less about any aspect whatsoever of Dobson's activities\
  \ save for his coupon mania. I wondered if Guido\u2014I learned his name eventually,\
  \ on day three, I think\u2014was himself a coupon collector. I put this to him,\
  \ in my best attempt at a Terry-Thomas voice, and it was the only time during the\
  \ whole Dobsonathon that he laughed. At least, I think he laughed. He gurgled, caterwauled,\
  \ hooted, made noises similar to those of an enraged badger, shrieked, and spat\
  \ all over the table. Something in his demeanour signalled that he expected me to\
  \ fetch a mop and wipe down the formica, but I have pride as well as poise, so I\
  \ spat on the table myself, repeatedly, though I forebore from the gurgling and\
  \ caterwauling etcetera. That gave him pause, so much so that it was like sitting\
  \ opposite a life-size wooden effigy in the back room of a snackbar. Although this\
  \ was not an experience I had ever had before, or not precisely, I knew instinctively\
  \ how to deal with it. I reached with a certain deftness into a pocket of my drainpipe\
  \ trousers, uncapped the lid from a tiny bottle of Dr Baxter's Cranium Agitator,\
  \ wafted it under Guido's nose, and was rewarded by the sight of him twitching back\
  \ to life, just as I had suspected. And so our conversation was able to continue,\
  \ though I never did find out the answer to my question. To this day, I have no\
  \ idea if Guido too was a coupon enthusiast in his own right. I saw no evidence\
  \ that any coupons had been amassed within the snackbar, and I had a damned good\
  \ search when my host took a toilet break, but of course he may have been one of\
  \ those collectors who keeps his cargo in the safety deposit box of a large and\
  \ important foreign bank, just as Dobson did, if we are to believe the janitor of\
  \ a large and important foreign bank who contributed a letter to the Quarterly Digest\
  \ Of Dobson Studies, Volume XIV, Number 2, a letter which the editor authenticated\
  \ as genuine after subjecting it to a battery of forensic tests. Such is the dedication\
  \ of those who take these matters with due seriousness. It is a trait I admire,\
  \ and I admired it in Guido, just as he admired my yellow polo neck sweater and\
  \ my effortless social graces.\nNow. Guido's song, which had so transfixed me, and\
  \ forged a bond between us, was self-penned. Dobson, it appeared, had had nothing\
  \ to do with it. I can't say this surprised me. We all know that the pamphleteer's\
  \ few attempts at songwriting were absolutely pathetic, hardly the kind of thing\
  \ to worry proper songsmiths such as, to pluck a name at random, Leo Sayer. Others\
  \ have written about the horrors of hearing such Dobson dirges as the godawful Drink\
  \ Ye Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take You Away, so\
  \ I needn't add to the brickbats. What intrigued me was why Guido, robbed of hearing\
  \ by that kindergarten firework mishap, had chosen to compose a song about Dobson's\
  \ couponophilia, and not only that but a song which aped the pamphleteer's own wailings\
  \ in many respects. Of course, Guido's work was a thing of melodic loveliness, so\
  \ in that sense it differed, but even so, the whole business struck me as a bit\
  \ fishy.\nOver a dish of shredded cabbage and bloaters, towards the end of our long\
  \ talk, my pal told me that what he was trying to do was to somehow become Dobson,\
  \ the better to understand him. This was such a startling admission that I am afraid\
  \ I banged my knee on the underside of the table and let out a yelp, which, let\
  \ me tell you, is an unforgivable breach of etiquette when one is sharing a meal\
  \ with a snackbar counter man of Guido's eminence. I was mortified. I knew he had\
  \ not heard my yelp, but he had seen it, and had probably felt its vibrations in\
  \ the air around his impossibly handsome head. I let fall my napkin, with as much\
  \ daintiness as I could muster, stood up leaving my bloaters half-eaten, and swept\
  \ out of the room, through the pantry and the kitchen and the snackbar itself, wrenched\
  \ the strangely enormous key in the lock, flung open the door as if I were at a\
  \ vital moment in a Terence Rattigan drama, and hit the grimy streets of this hepcat\
  \ town, wishing I had a muffler to muffle me against the wind. What I was muffled\
  \ against, for weeks afterwards, was shame at my own lack of table manners. Unable\
  \ to face up to the enormity of my conduct, I retreated to my usual haunts, the\
  \ ditches and barnyards, and tried to blame the fiasco on Guido. On the rare occasions\
  \ I was approached by a peasant of those parts, I would beseech them not to go anywhere\
  \ near the snackbar, thinking to smash asunder what today would be called its customer\
  \ base. I used some of the straw snagged in my hair to fashion a Guido-like voodoo\
  \ doll and stuck it with pins innumerable.\nBut came the day I found myself first\
  \ whistling, then humming, then, boy oh boy, singing lustily, from a mountaintop,\
  \ that stirring chorus about Dobson's small, blank, beige, rectangular piece of\
  \ cardboard, his Ur-coupon, and tears streamed down my face as I understood how\
  \ fortunate I had been to spend four days with the Man Who Would Be Dobson. He wasn't,\
  \ of course. No one could be. But Guido came closer, I think, than anyone else ever\
  \ has to being imbued with the pamphleteer's true spirit. It was a privilege to\
  \ know him. I am still on that mountaintop, still singing, dressed now in the apparel\
  \ of a beatnik, but minding my manners more than ever, and still attracting gasps\
  \ from passers-by.\n[2007-06-04]"
