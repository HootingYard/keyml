  \ Bowie tells us that \u201CYou can buy God\u201D. I had always thought he was spouting\
  \ twaddle, and pernicious twaddle at that, until I saw, in a New York shop window,\
  \ the baby Jesus for sale, with a price tag tied to his elbow. Alas, the shop was\
  \ shut, and I was unable to make purchase.\n\n[2013-03-08]"
