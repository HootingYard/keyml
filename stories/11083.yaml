  \ me, well, I wallow in sin. At least, I would so wallow, were there any opportunities\
  \ for sin in this godawful rustic backwater. Oh, how I would like to be a lascivious\
  \ urban voluptuary, fat and greasy! Instead, I have to spend my days surrounded\
  \ by straw and hay and pigs\u2014pigs unnumbered!\u2014and my nights tossing and\
  \ turning on a pallet in a hayloft, exhausted yet sleepless, janglebrained and hopeless.\n\
  Sometimes I pore over maps, searching for a path or lane that might lead from this\
  \ hellhole to a City of Sin. If ever I find one, I shall stuff a few sorry provisions\
  \ into a hanky and tie it to the end of a stick and tote the stick over my shoulder\
  \ and set off, one crack of dawn, to march along that path or lane towards my fat\
  \ and disgusting destiny.\nYesterday the village priest came shambling past the\
  \ pig sty and I hailed him. I asked him to hear my confession. We went into a secluded\
  \ corner of a barn.\n\u201CBless me father,\u201D I said, \u201CThough I have not\
  \ sinned, much as I would wish to.\u201D\n\u201CThen you are a pure and holy person,\
  \ perhaps even a saint!\u201D he replied.\n\u201CBut what of my sinful thoughts?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\u201CThoughts?,\u201D he said, \u201CYou are a peasant, and the child\
  \ of peasants. Surely you cannot claim to have an inner life? Are you not empty-headed,\
  \ more akin to a beast of the field?\u201D\n\u201CBut I do have thoughts,\u201D\
  \ I protested.\nAt this the priest looked vexed and troubled. He told me that, if\
  \ I did indeed have thoughts within my head, I must be a very peculiar peasant indeed.\
  \ He posited that I might be a changeling.\n\u201CI shall have to question your\
  \ ma and pa very closely, my child,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd get them to recollect\
  \ the precise circumstances of your birth. It may be that they found you, bundled\
  \ up in swaddling cloth, the abandoned babe of a wicked sophisticated urban person.\u201D\
  \n\u201CGosh!\u201D I said.\nAnd thus it was that, later, the priest took me by\
  \ the hand and led me away from the straw and the hay and the numerous pigs, away\
  \ along a lane that led to a city. He did not allow me time to gather a few meagre\
  \ provisions and bundle them up in a hanky and tie the hanky to a stick.\nAnd so\
  \ I was delivered to the city with nothing but the peasant rags I was dressed in\
  \ and a letter of introduction to a morally bankrupt urban fop of the priest's acquaintance.\n\
  After I waved goodbye to the priest, I made my way through streets teeming with\
  \ sin to the fop's bijou flatlet in a high-rise apartment. He was leaning against\
  \ a mantelpiece with a glass of brandy in one hand and a book of evil poetry in\
  \ the other. My heart was thumping. I realised this was the life I had been born\
  \ to. The foppery, the bijou high-rise flatlet, the brandy, the evil poetry . .\
  \ .\n\u201CYou smell of pig,\u201D said the fop, \u201CBegone!\u201D\n\u201CB-b-but\
  \ what of social mobility?\u201D I wailed, \u201CIf I have a bath . . .\u201D\n\
  The fop held up a dainty hand to hush me.\n\u201CCease your barbaric grunting,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CYou speak of phantasms.\u201D\nAnd from behind an arras his valet\
  \ appeared and dragged me out of the flatlet into the lift, which sank, oh so rapidly!,\
  \ back down to the street.\nLater, sprawled in the gutter, drenched by city rainfall,\
  \ spat upon by passing urban sophisticates, smelling of pig, weeping, when it seemed\
  \ all hope was lost, I had a brainstorm, such as occurs perhaps but once in a lifetime.\
  \ The idea sparked in my head fully-formed, clear in all its details, as sharp and\
  \ glittering as a diamond. I had discovered the Blairite Third Way!\n[2013-02-27]"
