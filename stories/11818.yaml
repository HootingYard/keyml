text: 'As you know, I am currently keeping my eye out for chickens. Thanks, then,
  to Ruthie Bosch for sending me this snap of a chicken alongside a smoking child,
  from a century or so ago. I will probably receive a stern directive from some governmental
  agency insisting that I airbrush the gasper out of the photograph, but history is
  history. Weirdly, it seems that in the early twentieth century not everyone was
  in thrall to some kind of Blairite-Cameronian-Third-Way-Consensus, in spite of what
  the BBC tells us. (See Lark Rise To Candleford, and any other period drama.)
