text: "Sinbad Hoonjaw ran amok. He fried some bean sprouts in a wok. And then he stuffed\
  \ them in a sock, for he is quite the nutter.\nSinbad Hoonjaw went astray. He lay\
  \ down on a bale of hay. He ate a bowl of Special K, then threw up in the gutter.\n\
  Oh dearest Sinbad, take this clump, a clump of posies for your sprains, I plucked\
  \ it at the council dump, oh dear dear Sinbad rattle your chains.\nThe finest fellow\
  \ that ever there was, I sing for Sinbad today because Sinbad Hoonjaw's eyes are\
  \ blue, and the number of eyes is thirty-two.\nThirty-two eyes? Can that be so?\
  \ And twenty feet from top to toe? A giant Sinbad with too many eyes? Or is it just\
  \ a clever disguise?\nIs he a dwarf in a paper suit? Does anybody give a hoot? You\
  \ say he's twee, you say he's cute. For he is Sinbad Hoonjaw.\nBut I have news you'll\
  \ hate to hear. He is about to disappear. Oh do not sob a salty tear. Weep not for\
  \ Sinbad Hoonjaw.\nHe was only ever a clutch of syllables, jaw and bad and hoon\
  \ and sin.\n  Now spit them out and into the bin.\n  The dustbin of words, where\
  \ you forage for meaning,\n  Like George Formby, while window-cleaning.\n  You're\
  \ up so high where the air is thin\n  Now spit the words out into the bin.\n[2014-02-14]"
