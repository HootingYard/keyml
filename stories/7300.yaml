text: "\nHere are some flappers:\n\nYou can read about one particular flapper, and\
  \ a criminal flapper at that, in my cupboard this week at The Dabbler. The flapper\
  \ is accompanied in my tale by a chump (unillustrated).\nRay Bradbury wrote a famous\
  \ collection of short stories called The Illustrated Man (1951), made into a film\
  \ (1969) starring Rod Steiger (1925\u20132002). Were Mr Steiger still with us, I\
  \ think I would write to him suggesting he play a character called The Unillustrated\
  \ Chump. This would not be an adaptation of The Chump And The Flapper, the story\
  \ in today's Dabbler, but a wholly different work, based on the boiling frustrations\
  \ of a chump who, try as he might, cannot get his likeness depicted by a single\
  \ illustrator. Mr Steiger did boiling frustration very well, and though he may have\
  \ had difficulty playing a chump\u2014for he was the most unchumpish of men\u2014\
  his training in the Method would no doubt have stood him in good stead. Alas, it\
  \ is not to be.\n[2011-09-16]"
