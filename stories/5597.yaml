text: "Back in the summer of 2008, I had cause to mention Sabine Baring-Gould, author\
  \ of innumerable works including a sixteen-volume Lives Of The Saints, a study of\
  \ werewolves, grave desecration and cannibalism, and a biography of Robert Stephen\
  \ Hawker (1803\u20131875), the eccentric country vicar who spent much of his time\
  \ smoking opium in a clifftop hut made from driftwood, talked to birds, dressed\
  \ up as a mermaid, excommunicated his cat, and kept a pet pig.\nI am pleased to\
  \ report that this morning, at the London Library, recalling Baring-Gould, and brimming\
  \ with glee, I borrowed his Hawker biography (The Vicar Of Morwenstow, 1886), a\
  \ collection of pieces entitled Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869), and a biography\
  \ of the great man himself, Onward Christian Soldier\_: A Life Of Sabine Baring-Gould,\
  \ Parson, Squire, Novelist, Antiquary 1834\u20131924 by William Purcell (1957).\n\
  This trio of tomes will, I expect, contain much that is diverting and instructive\
  \ and I shall share the more startling bits with you when I buckle down to reading\
  \ them.\n[2010-11-22]"
