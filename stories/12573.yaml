text: "I remember as if it were yesterday my very first encounter with Tarleton. He\
  \ was propping up the bar in a beige and dismal drinking den, beetle-browed and\
  \ lantern-jawed and babbling to no one in particular. I sat on a stool beside him,\
  \ ordered a sprangeloenkenkischt, and listened to what he had to say.\nHe was only\
  \ recently back from a hush-hush mission in the East, and was worrying, like a dog\
  \ with a sheep, at the impossibility of grasping the difference between the Near\
  \ East, the Middle East, and the Far East. What seemed to bother him was that, whereas\
  \ the location of the Middle East was as clear as dammit, between the Near and the\
  \ Far, placing the Near and the Far was by no means as simple a matter. If you were\
  \ slap bang in the middle of the Middle East, for example, the Near East and the\
  \ Far East would be equidistant from where you stood, or sat, or lay sprawled in\
  \ a hammock in the blistering noonday sun, going mad.\nWhen he briefly paused to\
  \ glug his kolokkengehemmelbe, I asked him which East, Near or Middle or Far, he\
  \ had been in, on his hush-hush mission. Swallowing the dregs of the fiery liqueur,\
  \ he spluttered and told me the point of a hush-hush mission was that it was hush-hush.\
  \ I could not disagree with that. I bought him another drink. His tongue did not\
  \ need loosening, but I was at a loose end, and he seemed to be a man of parts,\
  \ well worth listening to.\nI was wrong. For the next two hours, he gabbled on and\
  \ on and on, without cease, trying but failing to settle the matter of the three\
  \ Easts, Near and Middle and Far, now and then pulling from his pocket a crumpled\
  \ map, hand-drawn with a leaky biro on a filthy napkin, on which he had tried, tried\
  \ and failed, tried again and failed again, like the best or worst of Beckettians,\
  \ to hammer home the geography of the East, to pin it down, definitively, so that\
  \ he would no longer need to think about it. That, he said, in among his witterings,\
  \ was what he could not stand\u2014that no matter how hard he tried, the East would\
  \ remain forever beyond his grasp.\nEventually he staggered off to the lavatory\
  \ to vomit. He had left the napkin map on the counter. Idly, I picked it up. I turned\
  \ it this way and that, and then, feeling the breath of God on the back of my neck,\
  \ I crumpled it up and uncrumpled it and turned it upside down and back to front.\
  \ I laid it back on the counter and smoothed it out, downed the last of my goospelkschnittzern,\
  \ wrapped my muffler tight about my neck, and tottered out into the icy blizzard.\
  \ As I followed the tractor-tracks back towards my chalet, I heard from inside the\
  \ bar a scream, at once hysterical and tragic and unhinged and ecstatic. I lit my\
  \ pipe, as snowflakes fell.\n[2014-03-27]"
