text: "\nWho is the third who always walks beside you?\n  When I count, there are\
  \ only you and I together\n  But when I look ahead up the white road\n  There is\
  \ always another one walking beside you.\nT. S. Eliot's note on these lines from\
  \ The Waste Land explains that they \u201Cwere stimulated by the account of one\
  \ of the Antarctic expeditions . . . that the party of explorers, at the extremity\
  \ of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was one more member than\
  \ could actually be counted\u201D.\nThe account was by Ernest Shackleton, of the\
  \ Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914\u201317. The explorer was reluctant\
  \ to speak of the extra man, who, \u201Cduring that long and racking march of thirty-six\
  \ hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it seemed to me\u201D\
  \ joined him and his companions. It has long been believed that he\u2014it?\u2014\
  was an incorporeal being, a spirit guide, summoned by Shackleton's brain through\
  \ \u201Cmonotony, darkness, barren landscapes, isolation, cold, injury, dehydration,\
  \ hunger, fatigue and fear\u201D, as Michael Shermer put it in an article in the\
  \ Scientific American. A similar delusion is said to have affected others, including\
  \ the transatlantic pilot and accidental baby-killer* Charles Lindbergh, who sensed\
  \ the presence of a ghostly co-pilot on his solo flight.\nA recent discovery by\
  \ boffins in Antarctica, however, suggests that there actually was an extra man\
  \ with Shackleton's party. A manuscript, entitled I Was Shackleton's Extra Man,\
  \ was found encased in ice on a stray floe somewhere between South Georgia and the\
  \ Antarctic ice-mass. It was so well preserved that, when thawed out, the ink was\
  \ still not dry. Unfortunately, slapdash handling by an over-eager boffin resulted\
  \ in smudging, rendering parts of the text illegible. What follows are passages\
  \ from this historic document.\nGood evening. My name is [smudged]. You do not know\
  \ me. You have never known me. You will never know me. But if ever you trek with\
  \ sledge and husky across the great ice continent of the south, you might see me.\
  \ There! That is me, up ahead of the rest of the group, trudging through the snow.\
  \ That is me, lolling behind, never quite catching up with the main party. That\
  \ is me, over to the side, left or right, just out of earshot. I am always with\
  \ you but never quite with you. But I am no figment. I am all too real.\nI first\
  \ arrived in Antarctica in [smudged], the first man ever to set foot here. I was\
  \ here before Scott, before Amundsen, before Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. I was\
  \ here when the world was young. I cannot remember quite how I found myself here.\
  \ One minute I was lounging in a hammock in the daffodil-strewn garden of [smudged],\
  \ then I was out at sea on some kind of raft, and it was cold, and I shivered, and\
  \ everything was white, the sky and the sea and the ice.\nI made landfall. The raft\
  \ was crushed by pack ice. I headed for the interior, but soon enough I was walking\
  \ around in circles, my mind both numbed and unhinged by monotony, darkness, the\
  \ barren landscape, isolation, cold, injury, dehydration, hunger, fatigue and fear.\
  \ I would have gone to pieces, but at the end of my tether I was befriended by penguins,\
  \ who took me to their colony and nursed me back to health on a diet of fish and\
  \ algae and a rigorous exercise regime of swimming and flapping my arms and legs.\n\
  The years passed in a white ice haze, and I was content. But one day I woke up and\
  \ I was filled with a hankering for home. I longed for the daffodil-strewn garden,\
  \ the hammock, and suddenly memories came flooding back, of [smudged] and Captain\
  \ Nitty and the betting shop and [smudged] and the riotous parties up at the Big\
  \ House and crates of negus and [smudged] and bouquets of enormous genetically modified\
  \ crocuses. I had to return. With tears in my eyes, tears which turned instantly\
  \ to icicles, I bid farewell to my penguin friends and trudged away across the ice\
  \ and snow.\nIt was weeks later when I came across a group of explorers. I was no\
  \ longer used to the company of men, so while I shadowed them I kept my distance,\
  \ always enough distance to avoid having to speak, to explain myself, to tell my\
  \ story. What was there to tell? Nothing of note ever happens here. Time stops.\
  \ I had no idea how many years had passed, seven or seventy or seven hundred.\n\
  When the explorers were asleep in their tents, I crept closer and went rummaging\
  \ in the stores lashed to their sledges, the cases packed with monogrammed silver\
  \ cutlery, backgammon boards, cigar cases, clothes brushes, tins of button polish,\
  \ and copies of The Vicar Of Wakefield. I confess I helped myself to certain items,\
  \ but never stole anything important.\nAnd then one day I went a bit too far ahead,\
  \ or fell too far behind, I cannot remember which, and the explorers vanished in\
  \ the mist, and I never saw them again.\nBut luckily this was the golden age of\
  \ polar exploration, and soon enough there was another raggle-taggle band of doughty\
  \ chaps struggling with sledges and huskies across the ice. I joined them, too,\
  \ in my just-out-of-reach way, hoping if I followed them we would arrive back at\
  \ their ship, and I could stow away upon it, and return at last to [smudged] and\
  \ daffodils.\nYet so incompetent were all these chaps that I ended up as I had begun,\
  \ going round and round in hopeless circles. I am still here, lost in the ice, hankering\
  \ for home, salty icicles dripping down my cheeks.\nTomorrow I shall get a gun and\
  \ shoot an albatross.\n* NOTE\_: See Crime Of The Century\_: The Lindbergh Kidnapping\
