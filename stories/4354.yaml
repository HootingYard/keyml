text: "Returning from Belshazzar's feast, Agnetha and Benny grew increasingly despondent,\
  \ and by the time they reached the hotel both of them were staggering under the\
  \ oppressive weight of grim Scandinavian misery.\n\u201CIf Fernando were here,\u201D\
  \ groaned Benny, \u201CHe would brighten things up. He could draw sunbeams from\
  \ a cucumber.\u201D\n\u201CYou forget that Fernando is but a fictional character\
  \ in a songlet, Benny,\u201D snapped Agnetha. Tears were rolling down her cheeks.\n\
  \u201COh,\u201D said Benny, staring out of the hotel window. He saw Anni-Frid flit\
  \ past, like a phantom. Agnetha was beating her fists upon a piece of pine furniture.\n\
  \u201CAt least here there is no mysterious writing upon the wall, as there was at\
  \ the feast,\u201D added Benny, trying to open a crack in the gloom.\nAll of a sudden\
  \ Bj\xF6rn came striding manfully into the hotel lobby. His hair and beard and face\
  \ and clothing were blackened from the charcoal he had been burning.\n\u201CI am\
  \ looking for Anni-Frid,\u201D he said, \u201CHave you seen her?\u201D\n\u201CNo,\u201D\
  \ said Benny, lying through his teeth. But had he really seen her? Or were his eyes\
  \ playing tricks on him again, as they had in Uppsala?\n\u201CCheck the abandoned\
  \ cow byre,\u201D said Agnetha, \u201CShe went there earlier to clean her rifle.\u201D\
  \n\u201CSince many years I haven't seen a rifle in her hand,\u201D said Bj\xF6rn.\
  \ He dashed outside into the mist that engulfed the hotel grounds.\nAgnetha and\
  \ Benny slumped in the lobby armchairs, expecting to hear a rifle shot in the distance.\
  \ But none came. The only sound was the whirring of the fan above their heads and,\
  \ outside, the strange cries of such Scandinavian birds as had not flown south for\
  \ the winter.\n\u201CAnyway, how would Fernando draw sunbeams from a cucumber?\u201D\
  \ asked Agnetha, eventually.\nBut Benny had fallen asleep, lost in dreams of Belshazzar.\n\
