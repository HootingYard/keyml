  \ which alone could be its\_interest for me ! I believe I should stop short. The\
  \ London years are not definite, or fertile in disengaged remembrances, like the\
  \ Scotch ones\_: dusty dim, unbeautiful they still seem to me in comparison ; and\
  \ my poor Jeannie's \u2018problem\u2019\u2026 is so mixed with confusing intricacies\
  \ to me that I cannot sort it out into clear articulation at all, or give the features\
  \ of it, as before. The general type of it is shiningly clear to me. A noble fight\
  \ at my side ; a valiant strangling of serpents day after day done gaily by her\
  \ (for most part), as I had to do it angrily and gloomily ; thus we went on together.\
  \ Ay de mi! Ay de mi!\nThomas Carlyle, recalling his wife Jane Welsh in Reminiscences\
  \ (1881)\nIt was a rainswept gloomy afternoon in Chelsea when the doorbell clanged\
  \ at the house on Cheyne Walk. Sparky chatterbox and letter-writer Jane Welsh went\
  \ to answer it herself, for she had given all the servants a day off to enjoy the\
  \ rain and gloom. She opened the door to reveal, standing on the step, a tall angular\
  \ dusty creaking tatty bristly fellow, whose eyes were like fathomless whirlpools.\
  \ He might have been a chimney sweep, had he been dustier and the dust blacker.\
  \ As it was, she recognised him immediately, not surprisingly, as he called at the\
  \ house at about this time every single day.\n\u201COld Snakey!\u201D she cried,\
  \ \u201CYou are a tad early.\u201D\n\u201CYes, Mrs Carlyle, so I am, I hope not\
  \ inconveniently so. I'm afraid my appointment book is absolutely chocker at the\
  \ moment so I have had to squeeze you in today as best I can.\u201D\n\u201CWell\
  \ I am indebted to you for fitting us in. You know your way to the parlour. Go thither\
  \ while I fetch Mr Carlyle.\u201D\nAnd while Old Snakey made his way to the parlour,\
  \ Jane Welsh Carlyle climbed half-way up the stairs towards the attic where her\
  \ husband sat scribbling away at his interminable biography of Frederick the Great.\n\
  \u201COh Thomas! Thomas!\u201D, she cried, but it was no use. The attic was soundproofed\
  \ to blot out the sound of the next door neighbour's rackety hens, and of train\
  \ whistles, both of which drove the Scottish sage crackers. Jane climbed further\
  \ up the stairs until she was at the door of the attic, flung it open, and announced\
  \ in a bright and cheerful voice,\n\u201CThomas, you must come down at once! I am\
  \ so happy! The snake charmer is here!\u201D\n\u201CIsn't he a tad early?\u201D\
  \ growled the irascible polymath.\n\u201COh don't get all grumpy, Thomas\u201D pleaded\
  \ Jane. She was in high spirits, ever since the arrival of Old Snakey.\nThe pair\
  \ of them made their way down to the parlour, Jane skipping with glee, Thomas glowering\
  \ with anger.\n\u201CWhat with all this carry on I am never going to finish my life\
  \ of Frederick the Great,\u201D he moaned.\n\u201CI am sure you will, Thomas, even\
  \ if it takes you thirteen years of ultimately worthless toil,\u201D said Jane,\
  \ while humming a happy ditty.\nIn the parlour, Old Snakey was sitting in an armchair,\
  \ getting himself into what generations yet to come would call \u201Cthe zone\u201D\
  .\n\u201CYou two can make idle chitchat while I fetch the tall amphora-shaped wicker\
  \ baskets from the cellar,\u201D said Jane, in high frolic.\nBut the snake charmer\
  \ and the proto-Fascist sat in silence until Jane returned, lugging the two tall\
  \ amphora-shaped wicker baskets she had fetched from the cellar.\n\u201CDo you have\
  \ any preferences today?\u201D asked Old Snakey.\n\u201CI'd like a boa constrictor,\
  \ please!\u201D shouted Jane with unrestrained glee, \u201CAnd what about you, Thomas?\
  \ A python? A viper? A burrowing asp?\u201D\nBut Thomas merely grunted.\n\u201C\
  Oh, you're such an old miseryguts!\u201D said giggly Jane, \u201CGive him a surprise\
  \ then, Old Snakey!\u201D she added.\nAt which the snake charmer took from his pocket\
  \ a flute or pipe of mysterious Oriental origin and proceeded to play upon it a\
  \ mesmerising melody of mysterious Oriental origin. And as he played, so the lids\
  \ of the tall amphora-shaped wicker baskets were dislodged, from within, and out\
  \ of each came crawling a serpent, a boa constrictor and a diamondback rattlesnake.\n\
  \u201COoh, how unbearably thrilling,\u201D cried Jane, \u201CWe haven't had a diamondback\
  \ rattlesnake before! Isn't that exciting, Thomas?\u201D\nBut Thomas Carlyle, his\
  \ head still stuffed with what he called Prussian blockheadism, was hardly listening.\n\
  \u201CWell,\u201D said Old Snakey, replacing his mysterious Oriental flute or pipe\
  \ in his pocket, \u201CI have much to do, so I shall take your leave. I'll let myself\
  \ out. See you tomorrow!\u201D\nAnd he left the room, leaving the Carlyles and the\
  \ serpents alone together. No sooner had he gone than Jane sprang upon the boa constrictor,\
  \ laughing her head off, and strangled it with her bare hands.\n\u201CYour turn,\
  \ Thomas. Come on, cheer up!\u201D\nBut as he loomed above the diamondback rattlesnake\
  \ with murder in his eyes, there was no lightning of the Craigenputtock savant's\
  \ mood. He was angry. He was as gloomy as the Chelsea weather. He fell upon the\
  \ serpent with all his bottled-up ferocity and gripped its throat in his big hairy\
  \ fists and squeezed and squeezed until the serpent sank limp and dead upon the\
  \ carpet.\nBeside him, Jane Carlyle clapped her hands like an overexcited child.\n\
  \u201CTip top serpent strangling, Thomas!\u201D she yelled, \u201CWell, that's that\
  \ done for another day. You can go back to your attic and write more guff about\
  \ Frederick the Great. I will throw the corpses of the serpents over the fence into\
  \ next door's garden.\u201D\n\u201CI expect that is why his damned hens make so\
  \ much damned noise!\u201D shouted Thomas Carlyle, and he puttered up the stairs.\n\
  Outside, it was still rainswept and gloomy. It was another nineteenth-century afternoon\
  \ in Cheyne Walk. Ay de mi! Ay de mi!\n[2012-06-03]"
