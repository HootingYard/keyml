text: "You will recall the film Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994) in which Sandra Bullock\
  \ and Keanu Reeves are aboard a bus which will explode if it goes below fifty miles\
  \ per hour, having been primed with a bomb by cackling evildoer Dennis \u201CDon't\
  \ try to grow a brain, Jack!\u201D Hopper. I have been wondering if a similar adrenalin-thumping\
  \ conceit could be applied to the writing of prose.\nI am not suggesting I do anything\
  \ so foolhardy as to ask a disgruntled and slightly maimed ex-police officer to\
  \ hitch me up to a bomb which will detonate if I stop writing\u2026 well, I suppose\
  \ that is what I am suggesting. Cowardice, or sheer common sense, persuades me,\
  \ however, to hit upon a less perilous incentive.\nI have just spent ten minutes\
  \ staring vacantly at the screen trying to think what that incentive might be.\n\
  In Speed, Dennis Hopper is gleeful when a television reporter describes the fiendish\
  \ quandary into which he has placed the bus passengers as \u201Cthe whim of a madman\u201D\
  . He repeats the phrase to himself, chuckling. Now I am an almost inhumanly sensible\
  \ chap, and not a madman at all, but perhaps the whim of a madman is precisely what\
  \ I need to give vent to, if I wish to prime my prose with the innards-wrenching\
  \ pell-mell momentum of the film.\nOf course, not everyone would agree that Speed\
  \ is an appropriate model. Dennis Hopper rather overdoes the criminal mania, Keanu\
  \ Reeves is wooden, and the best that can be said of Sandra Bullock is that she\
  \ is irritating. And even though Keanu's fellow bomb-defusion expert Jeff Daniels\
  \ is killed off, you know that Keanu himself, and Sandra Bullock, will escape unscathed,\
  \ and Dennis Hopper come to a grisly end, because it's that sort of film. But predictability\
  \ has its own special charms. And predictability plus innards-wrenching pell-mell\
  \ momentum is clearly popular, when we consider that Speed reportedly earned its\
  \ makers over three-hundred-and-fifty million dollars. Now if I could only devise\
  \ my madman's whim, perhaps I could make a similar sum from a piece of prose.\n\
  The glum bat of misery swoops o'er my bonce as I stare at the screen and, regretfully,\
  \ admit to myself that this present piece of prose is not the one that will earn\
  \ millions. Having said that, should any readers feel impelled to deposit a vast\
  \ sum of money into the Hooting Yard Paypal account, I would be most grateful.\n\
  But, just as Sandra Bullock has to keep her foot on the accelerator of that bus,\
  \ I have to keep tippy-tapping away. It is true that I will not be blown to kingdom\
  \ come if I stop. In fact, nothing at all will happen. I do not need to grow a brain\
  \ to know that. Indeed, I have the freedom to get up and walk away and make a cup\
  \ of tea, so I think that is what I shall do, right now. If I had a University of\
  \ Arizona Wildcats tee-shirt, I would take the opportunity to change into it while\
  \ the kettle is a-boiling.\nYou will recall that Sandra Bullock's wearing of a top\
  \ with the Arizona Wildcats\u2019 logo proves to be a pivot on which the plot of\
  \ Speed hinges. When last I saw the film I had not yet learned of that other great\
  \ mainstay of Arizona life, the regional dish greasy doings. It seems to me that\
  \ either Jan de Bont, or his screenplayperson Graham Yost, or indeed Keanu Reeves\
  \ or Sandra Bullock or Dennis Hopper or even poor killed-off Jeff Daniels might,\
  \ at some point during the production, have suggested adding a further layer to\
  \ the Arizona reference by mentioning, or\u2014better\u2014showing, greasy doings.\
  \ It would probably be stretching credulity to have any of the imperilled bus passengers\
  \ tucking into greasy doings, but Dennis Hopper spends much of his screen time gobbling\
  \ snacks while watching his madman's whim unfold, so how difficult would it have\
  \ been to make at least one of those snacks greasy doings? Now I come to think of\
  \ it, given that, as I said, the dish was unknown to me when last I saw the film,\
  \ perhaps we are shown Dennis Hopper eating greasy doings! Obviously I shall not\
  \ rest until I have confirmed whether or not this is the case, so I shall have to\
  \ watch Speed again, with an eagle eye on the Dennis Hopper scenes.\nIt has just\
  \ occurred to me that I do not know what greasy doings look like. I must embark\
  \ on further research before my next viewing, or I will not know them if and when\
  \ I see them, and that would be a bloody tragedy.\nI don't know about you, but my\
  \ feeling is that, were this present piece of prose the bus in Speed, it would be\
  \ dangerously close to dropping below fifty miles per hour, and thus exploding.\
  \ Innards-wrenching pell-mell momentum is easier to blather about than to maintain,\
  \ in spite of the cup of tea which I was hoping would fuel a jamboree of thrills\
  \ and spills. That may be a lot to ask from a cup of tea, but it has been argued\
  \ that generations of British chaps could not have built an empire without their\
  \ cups of tea, and I am not trying to build an empire, merely to write deathless\
  \ prose, and perhaps earn millions, or thousands, or hundreds, or even just a pittance,\
  \ by so doing.\nYet all the while the urge to cease and stare, not at the screen\
  \ but out of the window, at trees and crows, grows ever more intense. What would\
  \ Keanu do?\n[2012-01-26]"
