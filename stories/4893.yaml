text: "I don't know about you, but increasingly I find myself compelled to cast anathemas,\
  \ often at bus stops, supermarkets, and other sites of close contact with one's\
  \ fellow citizens. But getting the tone right can be the devil of a job. One wishes\
  \ the curse to come across as neither deranged nor weedy, but rather as a considered,\
  \ cogent, rational, searing, and\u2014above all\u2014unarguable response to the\
  \ situation.\nHow pleased I am, then, to have discovered this splendid outburst\
  \ from Austin Osman Spare:\n\u201CYour theology is a slime pit of gibberish become\
  \ ethics. In your world where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity, everything\
  \ ends miserably, besmirched with fratricidal blood.\u201D\nIt is from his book\
  \ Anathema Of Zos, A Sermon To The Hypocrites (1927) which I am clearly going to\
  \ have to read, possibly even learn by heart. Further reading here and, enticingly,\
  \ the opportunity in a couple of months\u2019 time to see an exhibition of Spare's\
  \ work.\n\n[2010-07-30]"
