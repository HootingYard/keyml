  \ But what a bit!\nAt an advanced stage, the gunk is scraped off with a tallow-knife,\
  \ collected in a pot, reduced by steaming and fed to seahorses. After several days\
  \ the seahorses begin to display intricate and abnormal behaviour patterns. These\
  \ patterns can be traced on graph paper with propelling-pencils and a ruler. Comparison\
  \ with earlier graphs, done under a double blind test, has proved immensely illuminating.\
  \ So lustrous, indeed, that copied out onto onion-skin paper and crumpled up, they\
  \ can be inserted into glass bulbs and light a long corridor in a large building\
  \ for upwards of four days. By the fourth day, they are dimming, there is a dying\
  \ of the light, and sensitive persons mourn, as mourn they might.\nHaving disposed\
  \ of the gunk as described, the main bulk is best fed through a sieve. The most\
  \ effective sieve to use is one with so-called \u201CSwedenborgian angel\u201D holes.\
  \ These are not generally available in the shops, but can be ordered direct by post\
  \ from the manufacturers, thus keeping costs surprisingly low. You might want to\
  \ purchase two or three at one time. The fragile nature of the sieve means that\
  \ it will not, alas, survive much use. It is easily distressed, especially when\
  \ you try to force stuff through the holes, as certain boisterous and reckless persons\
  \ tend to do. If you have such a person on your team, it is a good idea to keep\
  \ them away from the sieves by telling them to go and keep an eye on the seahorses.\n\
  Other pesky or exasperating team members can be usefully employed\u2014and kept\
  \ out of your hair\u2014by laying the plumb line. This should consist of tent-pegs\
  \ and butcher's string and stretch as far as the eye can see. The line should ideally\
  \ be at the height of an average hollyhock, the calculation being made by consulting\
  \ the tables at the back of the Annual Hollyhock Height Register. A copy of this\
  \ ought to be in your local reference library, but will usually not be available\
  \ for borrowing, so a literate and numerate member of the team, with a valid library\
  \ ticket, should be delegated to copy out the required details. They can use the\
  \ back of the graph paper on which the behaviour patterns of the seahorses have\
  \ earlier been inscribed in majestic sweeping lines and arcs of unsurpassed beauty.\n\
  Meanwhile, having fed the main bulk through the sieve into a bucket, the bucket\
  \ can now be ferried to the platform. This should stand on sturdy props, the sturdier\
  \ the better. Do not on any account use balsa wood. You are probably familiar with\
  \ the case of Tarleton, and what transpired with his balsa wood props. If necessary,\
  \ test the sturdiness using the standard tests of sturdiness which appear as Appendix\
  \ VII in your pamphlet. Otherwise, proceed directly to the siphon and funnel palaver.\n\
  Siphon the stuff out of the bucket, working slowly and methodically and seamlessly.\
  \ As it passes through the funnel, take snapshots at one-minute intervals from the\
  \ designated angles. These need not be full colour snapshots, unless they have been\
  \ explicitly specified in the contract. That is certainly an unusual clause nowadays,\
  \ and if it does appear, it is worth checking. The contract might, after all, have\
  \ been drawn up by a halfwit. Try to ensure that no seahorses are visible in the\
  \ background of the snapshots.\nThe whole lot, save for the scraped-off gunk, should\
  \ now have been transferred into beakers, without spillage. Align the beakers along\
  \ the plumb-line. Once they are in place, and only when they are in place, attach\
  \ the snap-on, snap-off lids. Using a thick bold black indelible marker pen, draw\
  \ identifying symbols on the lids. For examples of apt symbols, see Appendix IX.\
  \ Make sure each one is different. There is often a temptation to repeat the seahorse\
  \ symbol because it is so fetching. Fight against this temptation with all your\
  \ might, like Christ in the wilderness.\nIn case of rainfall, it will be necessary\
  \ to cover both beakers and plumb line with tarpaulin(s). The approved colour is\
  \ an almost transparent light blue. Any other colour is likely to result in fewer\
  \ points being awarded, without the right of appeal. Again, the case of Tarleton\
  \ should give you pause if you are thinking of using black or yellow tarpaulin or,\
  \ God forbid, a particularly opaque one. It was not amusing when Tarleton had to\
  \ account for himself before the panel.\nThe seahorses\u2019 tiny brains will by\
  \ now be utterly ravaged. Scoop them from the tank with a standard angler's net\
  \ and deposit them on the slab. One by one, using a very sharp kitchen knife, remove\
  \ the brain from each seahorse. If you feel pangs of pity in your soul you are pursuing\
  \ the wrong hobby and would be better off taking up ping pong. Place the brains\
  \ in a brown paper bag. Twist the top of the bag to seal it and then swing it around\
  \ your head several times while ululating an incantation. It is important to note\
  \ that this step is essentially meaningless, so you need not put a great deal of\
  \ effort into it. But it is always a good idea to show willing. You do not know\
  \ who is watching.\nHolding the bag in your right hand, walk the length of the plumb\
  \ line, pausing at each beaker. At each pause, gaze mournfully into the middle distance,\
  \ your lips trembling. Some of the feathers in your headdress may fall to the ground.\
  \ You should disregard them, while at the same time being very careful not to tread\
  \ on them as you resume your walk towards the next beaker along the line. That is\
  \ unless they are sparrow feathers, in which case you should pick them up and put\
  \ them in your pocket. But that of course should go without saying, as it is blindingly\
  \ obvious, if you have got this far.\n[Extract from The Book Of Significant Tomfoolery\
