text: "Digby Thew, oh Digby Thew! What are we doing to do with you?\nIf it please\
  \ Your Worships, I would like very much to be a conductor on the sleeping car of\
  \ an important railway line. I would wear a cap, and have a sash, and fill out dockets,\
  \ and attend to the passengers\u2019 every need. I would hope the sleeping car,\
  \ like the rest of the train, at least in its first class compartments, was fitted\
  \ out to the brim of luxury.\nDigby Thew, oh Digby Thew! What on earth's come over\
  \ you?\nI realise my request is an unexpected one, Your Worships, given that until\
  \ now my place has been in the fields, tilling. And tilling hopelessly, I might\
  \ add. But I must confess that, like a number of characters in the great dramatic\
  \ tragedies, I have a vaunting ambition. I have not actually seen any of these plays\
  \ myself, indeed I have never been within ten miles of a theatricum, but I have\
  \ heard of them, repeatedly, from my more learned colleagues in the fields, when\
  \ tilling.\nArbogast, what say you? What's your take on Digby Thew?\nAs you know,\
  \ Your Worships, I have compiled a lengthy and exhaustive report on the Tiller Thew.\
  \ I think you will find it appended to Bundle Six. My conclusions there set out\
  \ are that Digby Thew is a hopeless tiller of the fields, as he himself acknowledges.\
  \ It is high time he was dragged away from said fields, to till no more, in perpetuity,\
  \ and found some other line to which to apply his talents. For let there be no mistake\
  \ that talent he has, oodles of it, oodles. Our quandary is to discover the nature\
  \ of that talent. It may well be that the wearing of a cap and a sash, the wearing\
  \ of them alone, leaving aside the dockets and the attending, will help to reveal\
  \ it.\nPut Digby Thew in cap and sash? That may be considered rash.\nIt may indeed,\
  \ Your Worships, but think how you would be commended for boldness if everything\
  \ worked out ticketyboo.\nVery well then, Digby Thew. Now prove yourself to be ticketyboo.\n\
  I will do my utmost, Your Worships. In cap and sash I shall prance along the corridor\
  \ of the sleeping car of the important railway line, filling out and issuing dockets.\
  \ Oh, I am almost physically sick with excitement! To think that a hopeless tiller\
  \ of the fields such as me should be given the chance to prove himself ticketyboo!\
  \ I shall not let you down, Your Worships!\n\nNewspaper reports on the following\
  \ day told a terrible tale of mayhem and chaos on the railways. In the sleeping\
  \ car, nobody got a wink of sleep. They were kept awake all night by the antics\
  \ of the conductor, who wreaked untold damage to the purple and gold luxurious deep\
  \ plush pile carpet in the car, by hacking at it all night long, hopelessly, with\
  \ a hoe.\n[2011-07-23]"
