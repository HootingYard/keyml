text: "I have maintained a list of every book I've read since 1982. (I did once have\
  \ an earlier list, stretching back to the mid-seventies, but this was irretrievably\
  \ lost at some point, and my memory is not good enough to recreate it.) I thought\
  \ it would be a fine thing to create a gallery of the covers of these many, many\
  \ books, where possible showing the edition I read\u2014not always possible when\
  \ I borrowed the book from a library. Here is a first stab at the project, showing\
  \ the first six books I read in 1982. The next half-dozen will appear tomorrow.\n\
