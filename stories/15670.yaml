text: "Last night I dreamt I went to Urk again. Have you ever been to Urk, wide awake\
  \ or in your dreams? You would surely remember if you had. Urk is a unique place,\
  \ a tiny Belgian exclave oh! so high in the Alps. More precisely, it is an exclave\
  \ of the province of Flanders, though its tiny population includes a tiny proportion\
  \ of Walloons.\nUrkites are known to state, with pride, that \u201Cnothing ever\
  \ happens\u201D in Urk. That is largely true. It is so tiny, and so high above sea\
  \ level, in contrast to the rest of Flanders, that very little of note has ever\
  \ occurred there. Its official history, available from the kiosk in the street (both\
  \ singular), runs to a four-page pamphlet printed in very big type, one-and-a-half\
  \ pages of which consist of advertisements. And the pages themselves are tiny! Just\
  \ as the kiosk is tiny and the street is short.\nUrk never signed up to the European\
  \ Union's Schengen Treaty, so visitors\u2014if there are any\u2014still need to\
  \ show their passports at the frontier. This is a chalet at the foot of the funicular\
  \ railway which climbs up, up, up, at dizzying steepness, to the village, where\
  \ the air is thin and the police officer is idle.\nAs one alights from the railway,\
  \ one is thrust almost immediately into the heart of Urk. This is the village square.\
  \ It is a patch of well-tended lawn, with a flowerbed rife with tulips, and a tiny\
  \ concrete statue of tiptop Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx. It is here you will also\
  \ find, slumped on a bench, at all hours of day and night, the Blind Goose-Killer\
  \ of Urk.\nWhen the exclave was founded, by a smattering of Belgian tuberculosis\
  \ patients over a hundred years ago, it was decreed that only one person in Urk\
  \ was permitted to kill a goose, and that this person must be blind. All the other\
  \ laws governing the territory were imported wholesale from Flanders. The origins\
  \ of the goose-killing edict are obscure, and may have resulted from a misunderstanding.\
  \ Whatever the case, there has always and forever been a designated Blind Goose-Killer\
  \ in Urk. It is a lifetime position, one of great honour but paltry reward.\nWhat\
  \ happens is this. Let us say you are in Urk and you wish to make a goose die. You\
  \ must go to the bench in the square and rouse the Blind Goose-Killer, who is probably\
  \ dozing. You introduce yourself, presenting your identity papers, if you are an\
  \ Urkite, or your passport, if you are a visitor. The Blind Goose-Killer cannot,\
  \ of course, see these documents, but will enact what is known as \u201Cthe sniffing\
  \ and the rustling of the pages\u201D.\nYou must then state, in Flemish, that you\
  \ wish a goose to be killed, and ask the Blind Goose-Killer to kill the goose for\
  \ you. Almost invariably, and while still half-asleep, the Blind Goose-Killer will\
  \ accede to your request, although once in a blue moon, or if in an ill temper,\
  \ or if bilious, he or she will refuse. Assuming the answer is positive, you must\
  \ then go and fetch the goose you want killed.\nYou hand the goose to the Blind\
  \ Goose-Killer. Apart from blindness, another characteristic shared by all who have\
  \ held the position is the possession of a pair of hands with eerie, vaguely inhuman\
  \ musculature. Once in the grip of these hands, the goose cannot escape its fate.\
  \ You could say its goose is cooked, though that introduces a second, putative,\
  \ abstract goose, which is one goose too many, and may serve to befuddle the Blind\
  \ Goose-Killer, so is best left unsaid.\nAs soon as it has been strangled, you take\
  \ the dead goose from the Blind Goose-Killer and offer your thanks. Although they\
  \ are in receipt of an annual stipend from the burghers of Urk, you should give\
  \ them some loose change as a tip.\nAs I said, last night I dreamt I went to Urk\
  \ again. It was a disturbing dream, more of a nightmare. The entire tiny exclave\
  \ was overrun with living, honking, dazzlingly white geese. And there, on the bench\
  \ in the square, was slumped the Blind Goose-Killer, torn and bloody and lifeless.\
  \ He had been pecked to death.\n[2017-09-19]"
