text: "Ingmar and Hetty are the first fop and fopette we meet in the smash hit musical\
  \ Seven Fops For Seven Fopettes. Ingmar is standing on a hayrick, whistling, and\
  \ Hetty enters stage left, carrying a lamb. In most productions the lamb is a mere\
  \ bundle of cotton wool. There is nothing remotely foppish about either of them.\
  \ Indeed, they might be mistaken for yokels.\nThen Ingmar sings the smash hit number\
  \ \u201COn Luneberg Heath Did I Lay Down My Submachine Gun\u201D, and Hetty replies\
  \ with \u201CGut That Herring!\u201D. By now the audience is utterly confused. Fops,\
  \ yokels, militia men, fisherfolk? What is going on here?\nThe action now turns\
  \ to the barn, from within which comes a cacophony of different noises, including\
  \ clanking, siphoning, ragtime piano, hooters, the cries of triumphant pole-vaulters,\
  \ oompah oompah music, and the like. Ingmar and Hetty enter the barn to investigate,\
  \ and when they emerge, they have become foppish, indubitably so. Hetty sings \u201C\
  I Am A Fopette On Crutches After That Accident In The Barn\u201D. They then become\
  \ engaged and a Lutheran pastor beckons them from the wings.\nThe second fop and\
  \ fopette to be introduced are Gladiolus and Gladiola. They are already wholly foppish\
  \ as they descend from a balcony on strings. Yes, they are puppets! The orchestra\
  \ strikes up a puppetty kind of tune, sprightly yet with mordant passages. Gladiolus\
  \ torments a heron\u2014also a puppet\u2014in a languid manner. Gladiola rescues\
  \ the heron from his clutches, and with a startling bit of stage trickery it is\
  \ transformed into a real heron. The fop and the fopette profess their undying love\
  \ for each other, and a Lutheran pastor beckons them from the wings.\nFive other\
  \ fop and fopette couples appear in turn during the next forty minutes. There are\
  \ moments of melodrama and terror, bits of slapstick, a Dadaist interlude, and many\
  \ smash hit songs before the curtain falls.\nAct Two begins with the Lutheran pastor\
  \ centre stage, alone at a lectern. He recites lengthy passages from Pontoppidan's\
  \ Explanations, while behind him mute blind love monkeys cavort in cardboard trees.\
  \ The second half of Act Two is the audience participation section, always an unnerving\
  \ experience. Usually, the rifles are loaded with blanks, and the piano wire is\
  \ actually made from thin strands of easily breakable dough.\nAct Three, with its\
  \ famous airship sequence, has always proved a huge challenge to directors. While\
  \ the orchestra plays Metamorphosen by Strauss, in the happy up-tempo version by\
  \ Julius Uptempo, the audience has to be convinced that six fops and six fopettes\
  \ parachute from the airship with seconds to spare before it explodes and is engulfed\
  \ in flames. Ingmar and Hetty remain on board, and are assumed to have perished\
  \ until the exciting finale.\nAct Four has never been performed in public, for reasons\
  \ given variously as stupidity and fire regulations.\nIn the exciting finale, the\
  \ seven fops and fopettes are married in a ceremony performed by the Lutheran pastor.\
  \ Ingmar and Hetty explain their escape from the burning airship in mime. Wilted\
  \ flowers are tossed on to the stage by a stooge in the audience, and there is a\
  \ rousing chorus of the smash hit \u201CThin Strands Of Easily Breakable Dough\u201D\
  .\nCritics were unanimous in their praise of the musical from the outset. In Unanimous\
  \ Praise Of Musicals magazine, Volume XVII, No. 7, July 1953, Bengt Bunglawala wrote:\n\
  I have often dreamed of seeing a musical featuring fops and fopettes and puppets\
  \ and a Lutheran pastor and a mysterious barn and a heron and melodrama, terror,\
  \ slapstick and a Dadaist interlude and audience participation and an exploding\
  \ airship and mute blind love monkeys, all accompanied by smash hit songs and a\
  \ happy up-tempo version of something by Strauss. In fact, it has been my recurring\
  \ dream, from which I have awoken, biting my pillow in a frenzy, five or six nights\
  \ a week since I was so high. Now it has become a reality, and it does not disappoint.\
  \ My only cavil is that there was no place for either Jack Hulbert or Cicely Courtneidge\
  \ in this production.\nIn Effusive Reviews Of Musicals magazine, the critic Tord\
  \ Grip (no relation to the football coach) was effusive:\nBoy oh boy! What a musical!\
  \ My critical review of it is particularly effusive regarding the audience participation\
  \ segment, when I contrived to substitute blanks for live ammunition and shot my\
  \ great rival Bengt Bunglawala in the kneecaps. That will teach him to question\
  \ my critical acumen!\nA film adaptation of Seven Fops For Seven Fopettes, featuring\
  \ Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, is still in the throes of production, several\
  \ decades after shooting began. No release date has yet been announced.\nTinie Tempah's\
  \ cover version of the smash hit from Act Three, \u201CA Fopette Dons Her Parachute\u201D\
  , features on his next album, which may mercifully never be released due to a sudden\
  \ and unexpected upsurge of good taste in the record-buying public.\nAlain de Botton's\
  \ squib How I Based My Entire Life On What I Learned From \u201CSeven Fops For Seven\
  \ Fopettes\u201D is available from all good airports.\n[2012-10-10]"
