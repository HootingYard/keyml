text: "In yesterday's piece on foopball I gave due credit for the (correct) spelling\
  \ of that word to Geoffrey Willans, chronicler of St Custards. I was led, naturally,\
  \ to think of his co-creator Ronald Searle, and to realise how educational Searle's\
  \ cartoons were in my formative years. I still have the copy of The Penguin Ronald\
  \ Searle which was on my parents\u2019 bookshelves when I was growing up, and which\
  \ I pored over with delight over and over again\u2014and still do. It was from Searle\
  \ that I learned of the existence of certain great books (Gibbon's Decline And Fall\
  \ Of The Roman Empire, Roget's Thesaurus), grammatical terms (the gerund), and historical\
  \ events (the Relief of Mafeking). He did not of course tell me anything about them,\
  \ but it was clear to me that they were part of an inherited cultural knowledge,\
  \ things I ought to know about, that I would learn about at school as I grew older.\
  \ Alas, it was the 1960s, so by the time I might have expected my teachers to enlighten\
  \ me, the rot had set in. With the exception of the Thesaurus, I do not recall hearing\
  \ about any of them at my 1970s grammar school. What knowledge I did pick up came\
  \ from the same source as the cartoons themselves\u2014the bookshelves at home.\n\
  If things were beginning to fall apart by the 1970s, how much have they crumbled\
  \ to collapse today? I doubt the words \u201Cthe Relief of Mafeking\u201D have been\
  \ spoken in a state school for decades past. It was, after all, a magnificent example\
  \ of British Pluck, a concept wholly alien in our brave new world. Now British Pluck\
  \ may be laughable\u2014and it is, it is\u2014but at the very least the tinies ought\
  \ to be told about it. For younger readers wondering what in heaven's name I am\
  \ talking about, here is a quotation which encapsulates something of the spirit:\n\
  We certainly have the habit of stepping off the kerb without looking round, but\
  \ this is not so much from blank foolishness as from the feeling that the road belongs\
  \ to foot sloggers as much as to any motorist; and if, as a consequence, we get\
  \ it in the back we merely die asserting our right. That's British.\nTo which one\
  \ feels compelled to respond, on the contrary, it is blank foolishness. But it is\
  \ also magnificent in its way. It should come as no surprise to learn that those\
  \ words were written by Robert Baden-Powell, a man who appropriately shared his\
  \ initials with British Pluck. And Baden-Powell was propelled to fame, before he\
  \ created the Scout movement, by his role at Mafeking.\nWhy did an insignificant\
  \ railway siding on the line between Bulawayo and Kimberley assume such talismanic\
  \ importance? News of the Relief of Mafeking gave rise to such unbridled rejoicing\
  \ back in Britain that a new word\u2014mafficking\u2014was coined to describe it.\
  \ And as we have seen, decades later Ronald Searle could make it the basis of a\
  \ cartoon knowing that his audience implicitly understood the reference. Briefly,\
  \ what happened was that, under the command of Baden-Powell, British troops hunkered\
  \ down at Mafeking to resist an expected Boer invasion of the Natal Colony and to\
  \ draw Boer troops inland, away from the coast, thus making it safe to land further\
  \ British troops. It was, in that sense, a pre-planned siege.\nNo one really expected\
  \ it to succeed, given the comparative strength of the forces on either side. But\
  \ the Boers reckoned without the sort of man who would breeze into the path of speeding\
  \ motor vehicles just because he considered it the inviolable right of an Englishman\
  \ to do so. Baden-Powell seemed to consider the whole thing as a boyish prank, and\
  \ employed \u201Cjoyous little dodges\u201D to outwit the enemy,\ntransmitting mock\
  \ orders through a megaphone, sowing sham minefields, climbing through imaginary\
  \ barbed wire, casting grenades by fishing rod.\nThere were other, more substantial\
  \ defensive methods, of course, but what may really have tipped the balance was\
  \ his ability to keep morale and spirits high. In those far off days, there was\
  \ an agreed ceasefire every Sunday, and the future Chief Scout used the opportunity\
  \ to provide well-organised opportunities for entertainment and recreation:\nThere\
  \ were Beleaguered Bachelors\u2019 Balls and beautiful baby competitions, cricket\
  \ matches and horticultural shows, bicycle races and tea parties, gymkhanas and\
  \ fetes . . .On Guy Fawkes\u2019 Day he mounted a firework display, first having\
  \ warned the Boers not to be alarmed. At Christmas he presided over a dinner . .\
  \ . He arranged polo fixtures on week-days\u2014when occasional shells added to\
  \ the game's excitement.\nNo doubt Baden-Powell was inspired, in both his tactical\
  \ and entertainment activities, by the memory of his early days in the 13th Hussars:\n\
  their favourite mess amusement . . . was to pile all the furniture into a heap and\
  \ turn somersaults on top of it while proclaiming \u2018I am a bounding Brother\
  \ of the Bosphorus\u2019. The height of comic sophistication reached by the Hussars\
  \ was to twirl the chandeliers at mess balls and spray the dancers with hot candle\
  \ wax . . . [Baden-Powell's] favourite music hall \u2018artistes\u2019 were the\
  \ trick cyclist, the \u2018fellow with a spring necktie\u2019, and the \u2018champion\
  \ smasher of plates\u2019 .\nAs with his road sense, one is tempted to dismiss Baden-Powell\
  \ as a blithering idiot. It is a sobering thought, however, that it is precisely\
  \ such blithering idiots, of the same mould, who explored the world and built an\
  \ empire. They had British Pluck, and it is something that may never be revived,\
  \ but is certainly worth remembering.\nIncidentally, well to remember too that among\
  \ the troops who arrived to relieve Mafeking was Baden-Powell's brother, who had\
  \ the splendid name Baden Baden-Powell.\nNB\_: The quotations above are all taken\
