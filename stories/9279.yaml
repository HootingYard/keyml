text: "I have never read Touching The Void, Joe Simpson's 1988 account of clambering,\
  \ crawling, and hopping down a snowy Peruvian mountainside with a broken leg. It\
  \ was recommended to me, by someone whose recommendations I generally trust, but\
  \ for some reason I never got round to it. Today I learned, via the Grauniad, that\
  \ the book has become a set text for teenpersons in our self esteem \u2018n\u2019\
  \ diversity hubs. I was startled, as I had no idea they were still encouraged to\
  \ read. It was not this revelation, however, that was the point of the story. Rather,\
  \ it was that various scallywags have been conversing with Simpson through the medium\
  \ of Twitter. All this social networking and internettery can bring writers and\
  \ readers together, you see.\n(As I know myself. In a fit of madness, I once sent\
  \ an email to Alain De Botton to berate him for not knowing the difference between\
  \ deprecate and depreciate. He replied, the sensitive soul, within about thirty\
  \ seconds, to protest that he did know the difference, and went into a lengthy and\
  \ convoluted justification of his misuse. I was not convinced.)\nAnyway, I am afraid\
  \ I must report that, rather than taking the opportunity to applaud Joe Simpson\
  \ for his valour and grit and gumption, the teenpersons have been whingeing at him.\
  \ Much of this is not worthy of comment, but I have to applaud the youngster who\
  \ coined the term \u201Ccrevasse wanker\u201D.\nNow I tend not to use the language\
  \ of the gutter myself, not from any sense of prudery, but simply because I consider\
  \ it a bit lazy. I once knew a man whose every single utterance included at least\
  \ one \u201Cfuck\u201D, and usually more. It was very tiresome to listen to him,\
  \ and after a while one wanted to stuff a rag into his mouth and have him whipped\
  \ out of town, as they might have done in an earlier, less barbarous age. Or perhaps\
  \ I mean more barbarous. If so, it would suggest that a certain modicum and type\
  \ of barbarism is actually a good thing. I must ponder that.\nGenerally speaking,\
  \ the rarer the fuckery the more effective it is. Pansy Cradledew, for example,\
  \ a woman of great elegance and grace, lets rip with a \u201Cfuck fuck fuck!\u201D\
  \ about once a year, on average. So unexpected is it that jaws drop, glass tumblers\
  \ shatter, and birds fall stone dead from the skies. Ms Cradledew's last outburst,\
  \ at some point in the year of Our Lord MMXI, was occasioned by some finicky faffing\
  \ with thin strips of cardboard and adhesive paste in the course of constructing\
  \ a cardboard model of an important building. She was not using the proprietary\
  \ paste known as Cow Gum. Perhaps that is what caused the sudden fuckery.\nIf one\
  \ must swear more often than annually, then I think one should at least approach\
  \ the task with mad creativity. The baroque flights of sweary fancy in the scripts\
  \ of The Thick Of It are a model here, but I think it is no accident that they are,\
  \ precisely, scripted. Few of us could come up with those verbal fireworks spontaneously.\
  \ The sadly-unnamed Twitterer who called Joe Simpson a \u201Ccrevasse wanker\u201D\
  \ belongs, I think, in Malcolm Tucker's company. It is a phrase of genius. I only\
  \ wish I could think of occasions when I might use it myself.\nKnowing not a jot\
  \ about Joe Simpson, and not having read his book, nor seen the film documentary\
  \ which was adapted from it, I have no idea if he deserves to be called a crevasse\
  \ wanker. But without for one moment discounting the valour, grit and gumption of\
  \ those who pit themselves against nature's terrors\u2014mountains, oceans, uncharted\
  \ territories, polar wastes\u2014there is something faintly laughable about the\
  \ whole business, is there not? I have read more widely in the accounts of Simpson's\
  \ predecessors in earlier centuries, and part of the pleasure, if not most of it,\
  \ is in the contemplation of the sheer foolishness at large. The following quotation,\
  \ very dear to me, seems to sum up an entire ethos. In Ex Libris\_: Confessions\
  \ Of A Common Reader (1998), Anne Fadiman writes\nWho but an Englishman, the legendary\
  \ Sir John Franklin, could have managed to die of starvation and scurvy along with\
  \ all 129 of his men in a region of the Canadian Arctic whose game had supported\
  \ an Eskimo colony for centuries? When the corpses of some of Franklin's officers\
  \ and crew were later discovered, miles from their ships, the men were found to\
  \ have left behind their guns but to have lugged such essentials as monogrammed\
  \ silver cutlery, a backgammon board, a cigar case, a clothes brush, a tin of button\
  \ polish, and a copy of The Vicar Of Wakefield. These men may have been incompetent\
  \ bunglers, but, by God, they were gentlemen.\nIncompetent bunglers, gentlemen,\
  \ and very probably crevasse wankers. It is a term we can also apply to the doomed\
  \ Scott and his chums, perishing at the South Pole a hundred years ago. I am beginning\
  \ to think it would make a splendid title for an anthology.\nIncidentally, does\
  \ one have to be British to be a crevasse wanker? Perhaps I am blinkered, but somehow\
  \ certain foreign persons seem less preposterous when pitting themselves against\
  \ the etcetera etcetera. For example, Werner Herzog's various forays, and accounts\
  \ of others\u2019 forays, into inhospitable wildernesses are, to be sure, ridiculous,\
  \ but there is a mad grandeur about them. Could Aguirre, The Wrath Of God be retitled\
  \ Aguirre, The Amazonian Jungle Wanker? I think not.\n[2012-05-25]"
