text: "From Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 2, Number 12, May 1851\n\u201CPhysico-Physiological\
  \ Researches on the Dynamics of Magnetism, &c., by Baron CHARLES VON REICHENBACH,\
  \ translated from the German, by JOHN ASHBURNER, M.D., is a scientific treatise,\
  \ showing the relations of magnetism, electricity, heat, light, crystallization,\
  \ and chemism to the vital forces of the human body. It is founded on an extensive\
  \ series of experiments, which tend to bring the mysterious phenomena of Mesmerism\
  \ within the domain of physics, and in fact to reduce the whole subject of physiology\
  \ to a department of chemical science\u2026 The investigations, of which the results\
  \ are here described, are of a singularly curious character, exhibiting the most\
  \ astonishing developments, with a philosophical calmness that is rare even among\
  \ German savants.\u201D\n\u201CIn the album presented to the King of Bavaria by\
  \ the artists of M\xFCnich, is an admirable composition by H\xFCbner. It is an expression\
  \ of the feelings of a large portion of Upper Germany. It represents a female prostrate\
  \ upon the ground, with the arms crossed, the face entirely hidden, in an attitude\
  \ of the deepest despair. The long hair floats over the arms, and trails along the\
  \ ground. The whole figure is a mixture of majesty and utter abandonment. The simple\
  \ title of the piece is\u2014Germania, 1850.\u201D\n[2010-07-24]"
