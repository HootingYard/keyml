text: "The weed people first came to public attention in William Hope Hodgson's 1907\
  \ book The Boats Of The \u2018Glen Carrig\u2019. They lived at the time exclusively\
  \ in a silent, weed-choked sea in the land of lonesomeness, and were described by\
  \ Hodgson thus:\nWe each of us stared down upon a most unearthly sight; for the\
  \ valley all beneath us was a-swarm with moving creatures, white and unwholesome\
  \ in the moonlight, and their movements were somewhat like the movements of monstrous\
  \ slugs; though the things themselves had no resemblance to such in their contours;\
  \ but minded me of naked humans, very fleshy and crawling upon their stomachs; yet\
  \ their movements lacked not a surprising rapidity. . . these things below us had\
  \ each two short and stumpy arms; but the ends appeared divided into hateful and\
  \ wriggling masses of small tentacles, which slid hither and thither as the creatures\
  \ moved about the bottom of the valley; and at their hinder ends, where they should\
  \ have grown feet, there seemed other flickering bunches. . .\nNow it is scarcely\
  \ possible to convey the extraordinary disgust which the sight of these human slugs\
  \ bred in me; nor, could I, do I think I would; for were I successful, then would\
  \ others be like to retch even as I did, the spasm coming on without premonition,\
  \ and born of very horror. And then, suddenly, even as I stared, sick with loathing\
  \ and apprehension, there came into view, not a fathom below my feet, a face like\
  \ to the face which had peered up into my own on that night, as we drifted beside\
  \ the weed-continent. At that, I could have screamed, had I been in less terror;\
  \ for the great eyes, so big as crown pieces, the bill like to an inverted parrot's,\
  \ and the slug-like undulating of its white and slimy body, bred in me the dumbness\
  \ of one mortally stricken.\nIn the century since Hodgson's encounter, the weed\
  \ people have become familiar figures to us, though it is fair to say there has\
  \ been no lessening in the visceral horror their appearance provokes in even the\
  \ strongest of constitutions. Thus it was that, when I arrived for my appointment\
  \ with a weed person at a swish metropolitan hotel, and it wriggled into view, a\
  \ spasm came upon me without premonition, and I would have retched, had there been\
  \ a bucket, and had it not been such an unforgivable social gaffe. As it was, I\
  \ managed to swallow a mouthful of sick, and I took my seat opposite the white and\
  \ unwholesome being, and proceeded with the interview.\nQ\u2014Thank you very much\
  \ for agreeing to meet me for what, I think, will be deemed an historic interview.\
  \ You are, of course, the first weed person ever to subject yourself to a no-holds-barred,\
  \ warts-and-all Q and A session.\nA\u2014[Silence]\nQ\u2014I suppose the first thing\
  \ to ask you is how you feel when the initial reaction you are greeted with is invariably\
  \ one of vomiting, loathing, and horror?\nA\u2014[Silence]\nQ\u2014It is interesting\
  \ that Hodgson says you are eerily silent even when attacking sailors. You seem\
  \ to be silent now. I hope that doesn't mean you're going to attack me!\nA\u2014\
  Oh no, don't worry your little human head about that. I think in the past hundred\
  \ years we have learned some manners.\nQ\u2014Yes, that is what I was given to understand.\
  \ May I ask what prompted that change, from hideous silent savagery to, shall I\
  \ say, impeccable drawing-room punctilio?\nA\u2014It's a good question. There are\
  \ two factors to take into account. First of all, it's important to understand just\
  \ how lonesome and silent and terrifying was the weed-continent that was our only\
  \ home. Since the diaspora, as we learned about other parts of the globe, less lonesome\
  \ and silent and terrifying, we have embraced civilisation, at least to some extent.\n\
  Second, we cannot underestimate the profound effect on us when we discovered Wilhelm\
  \ Reich's orgone accumulator boxes. I well remember my first session. I sat in a\
  \ prototype copper Faraday cage filled with SAPA-bion cultures, naked, for five\
  \ hours. When my eyes slowly adapted to the darkness, the room appeared grey-blue,\
  \ with fog-like formations and bluish dots and lines of light. Violet light phenomena\
  \ seemed to emanate from the walls. My mind seemed to be unfurling. I admit that\
  \ when I closed my eyes, the surging and seething continued, which would suggest\
  \ I was hallucinating, but I convinced myself the visions were real because they\
  \ seemed to get larger and more intense when I held a magnifying glass to my eyes,\
  \ and darkened when I put on a pair of sunglasses. I started to see a blue vapour\
  \ emanating from my body. I was radiating at the tendrils, at the penis. Madame\
  \ Curie may have died of it, but I would not go to pieces. I was radiating. I realised\
  \ I had orgastic potency.\nQ\u2014And you persuaded your fellow weed-people to become\
  \ Reichians?\nA\u2014Yes, that's right. We were initially fascinated by his soup-making\
  \ activities of the early 1930s.\nQ\u2014Soup?\nA\u2014Reich experimented with a\
  \ powerful microscope to examine the vegetative currents he had observed emanating\
  \ from his analysands. He threw meat, potatoes, vegetables of all kinds, milk and\
  \ eggs into a pot, which he filled with water. He cooked the mixture for half an\
  \ hour, took a sample, and hurried with it to the microscope. He then stared at\
  \ it for up to six hours at a time, hypnotized by the kaleidoscopic patterns on\
  \ which he gazed. He saw minuscule blue vesicles breaking off, slowly clustering\
  \ together, and pulsating. They looked to Reich like pseudo-amoebas, and though\
  \ he admitted he had only limited knowledge of protozoology, and deliberately refrained\
  \ from reading the literature so he could remain unbiased in his observations, he\
  \ became convinced he had discovered a hitherto unnoticed life form that existed\
  \ in nature and possessed its own generative power. He was seeing nothing less than\
  \ the first steps in the origin of life.\nQ\u2014In a bowl of soup?\nA\u2014Yes!\
  \ And this vital force was his first inkling of orgone energy. From there he went\
  \ on to construct the boxes in which so many people sat, for so many hours, to usher\
  \ in a new free world of unrestrained orgasmic release. Not just Beat poets and\
  \ Norman Mailer and Germaine Greer and Sean Connery, but, I am proud to say, all\
  \ of us weed-people.\nQ\u2014And as a result, you no longer attack people?\nA\u2014\
  Well, we have not yet managed wholly to overcome our atavistic impulses. From time\
  \ to time we gather in a hideous slithering slimy silent mass, imagining we are\
  \ back among the weeds and, yes, we do launch ghastly attacks upon you puny humans.\n\
  Q\u2014Oo-er!\nA\u2014[Eerie silence.]\nParts of the above were adapted from Adventures\
