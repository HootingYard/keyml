text: "\nBrowsing in the basement of a dust-choked and unkempt secondhand bookshop,\
  \ I found on the floor a slim pamphlet entitled A Guide To The Care And Feeding\
  \ Of The Internal Combustion Monkey. The author's name was not given, but there\
  \ was a picture of him below the title, a cad, a cad wearing a cravat, with a Terry-Thomas\
  \ moustache and a glint in his eye. That glint, I assumed, that cad's glint, was\
  \ the glint that led him to envisage, and then to invent, the internal combustion\
  \ monkey. Why did he not wish to crow his name from the rooftops, or at least to\
  \ print it on his pamphlet?\nI picked up the pamphlet, and purchased it (thruppence),\
  \ and made it my life's work, from that hour, to find out exactly who this cad was,\
  \ to give him a name, to slot him into his deserved place in the history of this\
  \ our island's glory.\nI began with the cravat. In the picture on the pamphlet it\
  \ was black and white, but I felt sure the real thing, when tucked around the neck\
  \ of the cad, had been bursting with colours. Which colours? I made multiple photocopies\
  \ of the picture, and spent two years, armed with crayons and watercolours and state-of-the-art\
  \ pigment-staining technology, working out the colour combinations most likely to\
  \ have emblazoned the cravat of the cad. It was thirsty work, and I drank a well\
  \ dry. This did not sit well with the well's owner, a florid bumpkin plagued with\
  \ whitlows, who evicted me from my chalet anent the well. And so I roamed the hills,\
  \ reduced to just a few crayons, but with my portfolio of photocopied hand-coloured\
  \ cad portraits intact, tucked in a satchel slung over my good shoulder.\nThere\
  \ was, up in the hills, the salon of a cravatteuse, and I made no bones about badgering\
  \ her. One by one I waved in front of her the photocopies, much as a conjuror might\
  \ deploy a deck of playing cards for a magic trick, until, at last, she stopped\
  \ me, by pointing her finger decisively at the photocopy of the cad in which I had\
  \ coloured his cravat in swirling curlicues of baize-green and fire-ant-red and\
  \ Lee Harvey Oswald beige, with a few subtle tints of indigo, cerise, puce, chartreuse,\
  \ mauve, mauve, and more mauve.\n\u201CThat is his cravat!\u201D, she cried.\n\u201C\
  And who is or was he?\u201D I asked.\nHer eyes narrowed. Her lips puckered. Her\
  \ dog, sitting at her feet, snarled. I felt a sudden mortification of the bowels.\n\
  \u201CHe was an unspeakable cad!\u201D she cried, and she had her dog chase me out\
  \ of the salon, and further up into the hills, where the air was thin, and the promontories\
  \ dizzying. I had left my satchel and crayons and sheaf of photocopies at the salon,\
  \ but clutched in my good hand the only photocopy that mattered, the one with the\
  \ accurate rendition of the colour scheme of the cravat sported by the cad. And\
  \ I knew, now, what I had not known before, that his name was unspeakable.\nI remained\
  \ in the hills for several years, living on rainwater and birds felled with well-aimed\
  \ pebbles. Slowly, gradually, I came to understand that, if the name of the cad\
  \ was unspeakable, then it had never been spoken, that nobody knew what it was,\
  \ leading to the inescapable conclusion that, thus unknown, it could not be written\
  \ down, which was why it did not appear, printed in big bold black letters on the\
  \ cover of the pamphlet the cad had written about the care and feeding of the internal\
  \ combustion monkey.\nAnd so I came down from the hills, and adopted a new life\
  \ as a bargee on an unimportant canal, and I sprouted a Terry-Thomas moustache,\
  \ and, yes, yes!, I too wore a cravat, of baize-green and fire-ant-red and Lee Harvey\
  \ Oswald beige, with a few subtle tints of indigo, cerise, puce, chartreuse, mauve,\
  \ mauve, and more mauve, and whenever I was asked my name, by other bargees or by,\
  \ say, canalside picnic persons. I shut my mouth, and kept it shut, and said nothing.\n\
