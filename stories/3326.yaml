  Dear Mariella, I have had a long-time interest in beekeeping. Unfortunately I have\
  \ a mortal fear of bees (and similar stinging insects), and neither my partner nor\
  \ I enjoy the taste of honey, rendering the material benefits of keeping bees somewhat\
  \ moot. I have read a great deal of books on the subject and have yet to determine\
  \ just why I am so fascinated by this most peculiar hobby\u2014though I do quite\
  \ enjoy watching beekeepers remove the honeycomb frame from an apiary, as I find\
  \ it quite relaxing. It has got to the point where it is affecting my marriage,\
  \ as my partner is entirely unsympathetic to what she describes as an \u201Cobsession\u201D\
  . I tend to spend most evenings reading apiarist manuals and commenting on beekeeping\
  \ forums on the net, to the detriment of our sex life. I am interested in sex, but\
  \ at this point I am more interested in bees. Is this kind of relationship normal?\
  \ How can I bring my partner round to enjoying my interest in beekeeping with me?\n\
