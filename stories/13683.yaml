text: 'Next time you go for a stroll along the Appian Way, take a pair of shears with
  you. Then, if you happen to encounter a hairy slave hurrying along, you can seize
  him and chop off his hair with the shears. When his bare scalp is revealed you will
  be able to read the secret message tattooed upon his bonce, previously hidden by
  his luxuriant bouffant. The message will be intended for a distant military general
  or potentate. Commit it to memory. You are now in possession of important and privileged
  information, and knowledge is power.

  Continue along the Appian Way until you reach the the encampment of the general
  or the palace of the potentate. Being neither hairy, nor a slave, nobody will suspect
  you of being the carrier of the secret information. You can use this to your advantage
  in all sorts of ways.

  Next week, in Hints And Tips For Ancient Romans, we will look at how you can influence
  the prognostications of a haruspex by tampering with the hot entrails of a freshly-slaughtered
  chicken.
