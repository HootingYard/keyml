  \ for to milk me a cow.\n  Madge Strudwick, Madge Strudwick, what will you do then?\n\
  I'll read the hot entrails of a fresh-slaughtered hen.\nAfter studying this verse\
  \ for several hours, pupils are required to write a potted biography of Madge Strudwick,\
  \ of no fewer than twenty thousand words, following her progress from the iron cot\
  \ in the orphanage to a pauper's grave, and taking in significant events in her\
  \ life, including the appearance of milk teeth, theft of her breakfast porridge\
  \ by bears, pole-vaulting competitions, airship disasters, the darning of a rent\
  \ in her polka dot dress, ignominy and pelf, later further pelf, deployment of the\
  \ Snodgrass implement, pantry etiquette, on her first looking into Chapman's Homer,\
  \ dreary rainy autumnal afternoons, the thing with the spatchcock, the encounter\
  \ with a spider while sat on a tuffet eating curds and whey, what she really thought\
  \ about curds, the pricking of her thumbs, dust in her boudoir, the agony in the\
  \ garden, gardening tips, her reputation as a chatterbox, clown murder, shortcake\
  \ recipes, planetary influences, chocolate swiss roll, gladioli, Choctaw lineage,\
  \ speech impediment, holiday snapshots, filbert hedges, the pounding of those infernal\
  \ drums, pictures of Jap girls in synthesis, collusion with vampires, baffling reappearance\
  \ of milk teeth, sun worship, pet budgerigar, possible sighting on the grassy knoll\
  \ on 22 November 1963, ribbons, melodrama, shoes, bus pass, library ticket, pippy\
  \ bag, anaconda, hoop, shutters, antimacassar, nunnery, pincers, peg, tap, bedevilment,\
  \ soot, soap, soup. Extra points will be given for pointy bits.\n[2014-10-22]"
