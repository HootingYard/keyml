text: "More from Phil Baker's biography of Austin Osman Spare, one of the chief pleasures\
  \ of which is its plethora of anecdotes and asides. Such as this:\nIn the 1960s\
  \ Ted Hughes and Peter Brook attempted to develop a language called Orghast, effectively\
  \ a magical language where words would have \u201Ca more inevitable relationship\
  \ to reality\u201D. For example, the Orghast for \u201Cdarkness opens its womb\u201D\
  \ (\u201Cstaple of any phrasebook\u201D as a cynic writes) is BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR.\n\
  I would like to learn and become fluent in Orghast. Apparently it has a vocabulary\
  \ of some two thousand words, but of these only about fifty count as \u201Creal\
  \ Orghast\u201D, according to Ted Hughes, and he should know. I wonder what the\
  \ Orghast is for \u201CBy \u2018eck, Sylvia, when you first kissed me you drew blood\u201D\
  .\nI hope, when I have mastered the fifty magic words, that I do not have the dismissive\
  \ attitude of Rayner Heppenstall towards another invented language\nI had never\
  \ thought highly of Esperanto (my father had once tried to make me learn it, but\
  \ when I found the word for bird was \u2018birdo\u2019 I could no longer take it\
  \ seriously).\n[2011-08-29]"
