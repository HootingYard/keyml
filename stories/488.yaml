text: "For a long time, I used to go to bed early. I was exhausted from long days\
  \ working as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. There are those who think\
  \ that being a janitor is an easy life, little more than a matter of rattling a\
  \ set of keys, sloshing a mop along a corridor floor, and glaring reproachfully\
  \ at all who pass by. There may be janitors of that kidney, but I was not that kind\
  \ of janitor, and never had been, neither in this nor in any of my earlier janitorships.\
  \ It is a curious fact that the buildings in which I have been a janitor have all\
  \ housed milk-related activities. Before being appointed to my post in the evaporated\
  \ milk factory, I worked at a condensed milk canning plant, a milk of magnesia research\
  \ laboratory, and a milk slops sloppage tank.\nWhen I was younger I lacked application\
  \ and was frequently reprimanded, on a carpet, as is usually the case, by my superiors.\
  \ The overseer of the sloppage tank was particularly rancorous, as I recall. But\
  \ by the time I fetched up at the evaporated milk factory, I took my duties seriously,\
  \ excessively so, and that was why I was exhausted at the end of the day. To be\
  \ precise, I was exhausted before the end of the day, hence my going to bed early.\n\
  There is a pamphlet by Dobson, entitled Tips For Janitors (out of print), which\
  \ helped to mend my ways. One boiling hot summer Sunday, at a loose end, I went\
  \ to visit a dying janitor in a Mercy Home. His brow was beetle and his jaw was\
  \ lantern, and he was slowly perishing from a malady which had set in after an attack\
  \ of the bindings and which he could not shake off due to his advanced age. It was\
  \ not entirely clear just how old he was, for his birth certificate had been destroyed\
  \ by worms. He certainly looked unbelievably ancient when I went to see him on that\
  \ boiling day. Propped up in a sort of collapsible medical chair, surrounded by\
  \ dripping foliage, like General Sternwood in The Big Sleep, he had made a vain\
  \ attempt to mask his decrepitude by dyeing his hair black with boot polish and\
  \ by sporting the type of tee shirt worn by young Japanese trendies. Neither ploy\
  \ fooled me. I knew I was looking at a janitor who had begun his career in the age\
  \ of gas mantles and steam.\nMy visit was prompted by a plea from the Charitable\
  \ Board For Janitors Close To Death, seeking volunteers to pay social calls on janitors\
  \ close to death to brighten their last days. I thought myself too lugubrious to\
  \ be suitable for such a good deed, but the Board's director, an ex-flapper by the\
  \ name of Mimsy Henbane, said that this particular dying janitor rejoiced in the\
  \ lugubrious and funereal and bleak and that my presence would lift his spirits.\n\
  Like the Italian castrato opera singer Luigi Marchesi (1754\u20131829), who, irrespective\
  \ of the part he was playing, insisted on making his stage entrances on horseback,\
  \ wearing a helmet with white feathers several feet long, I liked to cut something\
  \ of a dash when entering a Mercy Home. On this particular Sunday I was ensmothered\
  \ in fine kingly raiment, complete with the pelt of a wolverine (Gulo gulo, the\
  \ largest land-dwelling member of the weasel family), a burnished golden helmet\
  \ Marchesi would have died for, and a bauble or two. It was stiflingly hot, of course,\
  \ but my blood is ice cold, and I had achieved a temperate equilibrium as I strode\
  \ majestically into the greenhouse wherein the dying janitor awaited me. I am unable\
  \ to tell you his name, not because I do not know it, but because I found it completely\
  \ unpronounceable. He was of Tantarabim parentage, and bore one of those impossible,\
  \ and I must say foolish, names they are so fond of in that land. He was also wearing\
  \ a pair of dentures which had been designed for a mouth much larger than his, so\
  \ it was not only his name I failed to catch. I had brought with me, as a gift,\
  \ a bag of Extra Crunchy Hard Crunchable Crackers, and it looked to me as if those\
  \ gigantic teeth would be more than a match for their crunchiness. Indeed they were.\
  \ For a few minutes, as the dying janitor shovelled the crackers gratefully into\
  \ his gob, it was like being in a hot damp greenhouse with a snapping turtle. He\
  \ crunched his way through the whole bagful so rapidly that I wondered if he was\
  \ ever fed. I had not seen any staff in the Mercy Home, not even a janitor. In fact,\
  \ I had not seen any other patients. There were some pigs in a sty between the greenhouse\
  \ and the main building, but otherwise the place seemed deserted.\nOne of the things\
  \ I have always liked about people from Tantarabim is that they are so easy to rub\
  \ along with. After he had scoffed his crackers, the dying janitor sat there smiling\
  \ weakly but, I supposed, contentedly, while I loomed above him lugubrious and funereal\
  \ and bleak, just as Mimsy Henbane had suggested. I decided to stay until his smile\
  \ faded, and propped myself against a pane of glass, having first twisted the dying\
  \ janitor's neck round slightly so I was still within his sight. It felt good to\
  \ be doing something selfless for one who had trodden the path of janitordom before\
  \ me. I pondered if this was what being a boy scout was all about. My only connection\
  \ with the toggled tribe had been a single incident, in the year of the Tet Offensive,\
  \ when I failed to stop a snackbar hooligan pushing a puny boy scout into a lake.\
  \ I would have intervened, but I was preoccupied at the time with recalibrating\
  \ a mechanism, one of my leisure pursuits in the days when I was an indolent janitor\
  \ rather than the indefatigable one I became at the evaporated milk factory, when\
  \ I no longer had time nor energy for leisure pursuits of any kind. Despite his\
  \ puniness, the boy scout had passable swimming skills, and he managed to avoid\
  \ drowning in the lake, a lake in which many had met a watery death. I knew this\
  \ because their names were inscribed on a plaque affixed to a post at the edge of\
  \ the lake, and I had bashed the post into the mud myself, with a hammer, one day\
  \ many years before when I had nothing else to do. I used to roam the lakes and\
  \ ponds and thereabouts with my hammer, looking for posts to bash into the muck.\
  \ If I could not find any posts I became disconsolate and squatted on the nearest\
  \ available tussock, sobbing, until it was time to wend my way home.\nI had plenty\
  \ of time to dwell upon my past as I leaned against the pane of glass in the hot\
  \ greenhouse, for the dying janitor's smile never wavered. It seemed that he was\
  \ so pleased with the crackers and with my lugubrious presence that he had entered\
  \ a state of transcendent bliss. I was determined, however, to keep to my plan of\
  \ staying with him until he was no longer smiling. I knew Mimsy Henbane would approve,\
  \ and in a sense it was also a way of assuaging the guilt I still felt about failing\
  \ to prevent the snackbar hooligan shoving that puny boy scout into the lake. That\
  \ had happened many years before, as I have indicated, but as time passed my conscience\
  \ gnawed at me with ever increasing ferocity. In those days, far from going to bed\
  \ early, often I never went to bed at all, instead marching up and down countryside\
  \ lanes all night, incapable of sleep. I was keeping the same hours as owls, and\
  \ if nothing else that fraught insomniac period helped me to extend my ornithological\
  \ education. If I was a pamphleteer like Dobson, rather than a janitor, I am sure\
  \ I could churn out innumerable essays on owls and other nocturnal birds. As it\
  \ is, I make do by buttonholing the occasional evaporated milk factory employee\
  \ and sharing my bird-learning with them, whether they like it or not. It was a\
  \ pity that the dying janitor was from Tantarabim, and wearing dentures far too\
  \ big for his mouth, and thus would have been unintelligible to me were he to be\
  \ prodded into speech, for there was something in his demeanour which told me that\
  \ he, like me, was an erudite janitor. I could not guess what his area of expertise\
  \ was, of course, so I made a mental note to ask Mimsy Henbane when next I called\
  \ into the Charitable Board For Janitors Close To Death HQ.\nMimsy's journey from\
  \ flapper to charitable board director was an extraordinary one. Her story has inspired\
  \ poets, novelists, composers, film makers, and creative titans in just about any\
  \ field you can think of, not least the designers of tee shirts worn by young Japanese\
  \ trendies. Dennis Beerpint wrote a series of Cantos about her. Anthony Burgess\
  \ struggled for years with a novel based on her life, but was forced to abandon\
  \ it when he concluded that such a work was beyond his imaginative powers. An opera\
  \ bouffe by Boof was inspired by her. Dan Brown is apparently working on a potboiler\
  \ called The Mimsy Henbane Code. Before his untimely death, Rainer Werner Fassbinder\
  \ planned a film about her set in a tough foreign dockyard full of tough homosexual\
  \ sailors. The list goes on. Yet intriguingly, not one of the works based on her\
  \ life ever addressed the root of her devotion to janitors close to death. There\
  \ is always plenty about her flapperhood, and about the Antarctic expedition, the\
  \ beekeeping, the shipwreck, the surgical interventions, the gladsome spring and\
  \ the buffets of autumn, the postage stamp mystery, the years of crime, the gutta\
  \ percha interlude, the bittersweet romances, the collapsed lung, the other collapsed\
  \ lung, the delicate little fists beating hopelessly against wooden panels in the\
  \ hut in the forest, the evil chickens, the gaudy boudoir, the Karen Carpenter incident,\
  \ the vandalism, the scuba diving, the pitfalls, the obelisk, the gravel pathways,\
  \ the euphonium band, the pint of milk, and the gruesome business in the tough foreign\
  \ dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. Yet of janitors, dying or otherwise,\
  \ not one word. I know, because I've checked. Before I started working myself to\
  \ exhaustion in the evaporated milk factory, I was able to spend some of my leisure\
  \ time making a thorough study of all the Mimsy Henbane-related books and films\
  \ and plays and opera bouffes and trendy Japanese tee shirts etcetera. From Beerpint\
  \ to Burgess, from Boof to Brown, no creative titan deems janitors worthy of a mention.\
  \ I try not to take this personally, and deny that I have poked pins into miniature\
  \ wax effigies of any of those named, or of any others, such as Harrison Birtwistle\
  \ and Salman Rushdie and the paperbackist Pebblehead, during spooky midnight ceremonies\
  \ where I have been joined by jabbering chanting hooded bloodsoaked wild-eyed whirling\
  \ drooling drugged-up maniacs. In any case, whatever lugubrious dismay I may feel\
  \ towards those who have ignored my profession is more than outweighed by the fact\
  \ that Mimsy Henbane herself devoted her latter years to my kind. And she did so\
  \ selflessly, apart from the excessive fees she charged to those lucky enough to\
  \ find a haven in one of her Mercy Homes, or in one of the greenhouses next to the\
  \ pig sties in one of her Mercy Homes, and the extra charges she levied on the relicts\
  \ of those janitors who, dying, died, and passed into the realm of which we know\
  \ naught. So despite my hours of study, I am as clueless as the next janitor as\
  \ to Mimsy's motives. All I know is that she fully deserves my gratitude, and that\
  \ is why I stood leaning against a pane of glass in that greenhouse while a dying\
  \ janitor propped up in a collapsible medical chair, his hair slathered in boot\
  \ polish and his dentures too big for his mouth, smiled at me for three whole days.\
  \ I did it for Mimsy.\nI think what wiped the smile off his face at last was that\
  \ he felt pangs of hunger for more crackers. He mumbled something at me in that\
  \ weird, impossible Tantarabim accent, and pointed a bony finger at the empty cracker\
  \ bag he had dropped on the floor. I told him that I would go to Old Ma Purgative's\
  \ clifftop superstore, a lengthy hike away, to get another bagful. I wondered if\
  \ he would still be alive when I returned. As I turned to sweep out of the greenhouse\
  \ as dramatically as I had entered, in my kingly raiment, he rummaged in a little\
  \ wooden cupboard next to his chair, took out the Dobson pamphlet Tips For Janitors,\
  \ and pressed it into my greedily outstretched hands.\nOver the next few days, as\
  \ I made my slow lugubrious funereal bleak way towards the coast and the clifftop,\
  \ I stopped from time to time to sprawl on bright summertime lawns and I read the\
  \ out of print pamphlet from cover to cover. When I had finished it, I started again\
  \ from the beginning. I was thunderstruck. In spite of my various milk-related janitorial\
  \ posts, I felt I was reading about an entirely new and different calling, one of\
  \ which I was profoundly ignorant. Between them, the dying janitor and Mimsy Henbane\
  \ and Dobson changed my life.\nEager as I was to become a reborn janitor at the\
  \ earliest opportunity, I was mindful of my promise to the dying janitor in the\
  \ greenhouse next to the pig sty. I had made him so happy with that bag of Extra\
  \ Crunchy Hard Crunchable Crackers, and had vowed to fetch him another bag. Torn\
  \ between duty and desire, I spent a miserable morning sobbing on a tussock. Then\
  \ Fortune smiled upon me, just as the dying janitor had done, by sending into my\
  \ path a boy scout. As puny as the one who, years before, I had seen pushed into\
  \ a lake by a snackbar hooligan, the child appeared at the side of my tussock and\
  \ inquired if I had a job for him to do in exchange for a shilling. I took his coinage\
  \ and sent him off towards Old Ma Purgative's clifftop superstore, having armed\
  \ him with full instructions and a map, and his shilling back to pay for the crackers.\
  \ Then I turned my face towards Pointy Town and headed for the evaporated milk factory,\
  \ and a new life.\n[2008-07-20]"
