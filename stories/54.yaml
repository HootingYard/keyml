text: "More from Carl Sagan's excellent The Demon-Haunted World. He tells us that,\
  \ according to alien abductee Betty Hill, the pesky visitors from outer space \u201C\
  frequently help themselves to some of [the abductee's] belongings, such as fishing\
  \ rods, jewelry of different types, eyeglasses or a cup of laundry soap\u201D.\n\
  Remember that, and next time you see a myopic angler festooned with rings and necklaces\
  \ emerging from the launderette, you can make a citizen's arrest and cart it off\
  \ to your secret underground lab.\n[2007-02-16]"
