  \ banished from our mental purview, dumped into a gigantic imaginary dustbin, the\

  \ creatures, always worthy of a few lines here and there. We don't go overboard,\
  \ we don't babble on and on and on about badgers, but we take note of their doings,\
  \ and bring you interesting badger news when appropriate.\nWhat to do then, when\
  \ a non-existent \u201Ccelebrity\u201D and badgers collide? It is with a heavy sigh\
  \ that I bring you this four-month old headline which has only just been transmitted\
