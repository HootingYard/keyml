text: "It is ever more apparent that Hooting Yard needs to be both robust and transparent.\
  \ I want to move the debate forward, and that is why I am making arrangements for\
  \ someone\u2014possibly the octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins\u2014to clamber up a\
  \ ladder on to the roof of a large and imposing building and to shout, through a\
  \ loudhailer, a robust and transparent message. The message will be shouted in a\
  \ transparently robust manner, from behind a transparent screen, made of robust\
  \ glass. It's a big ask, but I think it's important to begin the conversation. One\
  \ benefit of such robust transparency is that we might, as a result, be invited\
  \ into the government's big tent of all the talents. Asked to predict the likelihood\
  \ of this, our resident prognosticator Little Severin The Mystic Badger scrabbled\
  \ around in a pile of twigs and muck and came to no definite conclusion. Perhaps\
  \ he is insufficiently robust. Nor, of course, is he transparent, being a badger.\n\
