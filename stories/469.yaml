text: "He was a man of parts.\nHe was a slobbering and syphilitic whoremonger who\
  \ could yet charm the birds from the sky, often when leaning against a mantelpiece\
  \ at a swish cocktail party.\nLike Erik Satie, he liked to eat sausages in camphor.\n\
  His neck movements were sometimes like those of a vulture and sometimes like those\
  \ of the sadly extinct giant short-faced bear.\nWhen out and about on his so-called\
  \ \u201Cpatrols\u201D, he usually wore a crushed crimplene cravat and a superabundance\
  \ of brazen jet cufflinks, each one of which he polished vigorously with swarfega.\
  \ The distribution of so many unnecessary cufflinks about his person was a wonder\
  \ to behold, and was regularly remarked upon by fashion mavens, but never copied.\n\
  When he wore a hat, he wore it with a chain linking it to a sturdy ring bolted to\
  \ the back of his neck, and he wore it with eclat.\nHe sucked on spangles of many\
  \ flavours.\nSlipping out of a den of vice through a side door, slinking with surprising\
  \ elegance along a night alley thick with the leavings of debauchery, he whistled\
  \ Oh Danny Boy, attracting the attention of police officers. Threatened with truncheons\
  \ and prosecution, he turned upon those who would do him harm a basilisk stare,\
  \ and faced them down, magnificent in his imperiousness.\nHis slobberings increased\
  \ as he grew older, and he collected them when he could into a tin spittle-basin,\
  \ and left it out on his porch at night, where rainfall diluted the slobberings,\
  \ and the morning dew diluted them further, and during his morning patrol he poured\
  \ them into a pond.\nYou could cut yourself on the creases in his trousers, they\
  \ were so well-pressed. He ironed them with a vintage Pastewick steam iron.\nLike\
  \ Georges Clemenceau, he ate gruel for breakfast.\nWhen taking refuge in thickets\
  \ of shrubbery he passed the time by fomenting wild schemes in his brain.\nThe skin\
  \ on his ears had a patina of verdigris, as if it were copper or bronze, likewise\
  \ the skin in the area of one of his collarbones.\nImagine him at ninety, in a dinghy,\
  \ somewhere out on the cold and roaring sea, alone, without oar or compass or radio\
  \ set or his beloved sausages in camphor, his tin flask of Courvoisier almost empty.\
  \ Even here, long-tailed vermin are scuttling through his mind, like the sewer it\
  \ is. His slobbering is unabated. Yet two days later he is to be found sprawled\
  \ in a deckchair upon a golden beach, his still glorious bouffant shiny with hair\
  \ oil, the bolt in the back of his neck freshly greased, and dangling from the ring\
  \ and the chain a Panama hat like the one favoured by actor Sydney Greenstreet.\n\
  And imagine him now aged just ten, at a crossroads in desolate terrain. A big black\
  \ crow is perched on the signpost. Whither shall he wander, this puny child?\n[2008-07-07]"
