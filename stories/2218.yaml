text: "Letters have been pouring in from readers eager to make their own putti, wondering\
  \ how to go about doing so. Here, for example, is Tim Thurn:\nDearest Frank, he\
  \ writes, in his overfamiliar way, I am eager to make a putto of my own, but have\
  \ absolutely no idea how to go about it. Can you offer any tips to a cack-handed\
  \ reader whose previous efforts at craft projects have ended in disaster? Passionately\
  \ yours, Tim.\nThe first thing I will say is that cack-handedness, in and of itself,\
  \ should never deter a Hooting Yard reader from undertaking any craft project, however\
  \ complicated. As M People put it so eloquently, \u201Cyou've got to search for\
  \ the hero inside yourself\u201D. Do you think for one minute that heroes such as\
  \ Ulysses or Tristram Shandy or Watt would have shrunk from the challenge of putto-making,\
  \ had they had to face it? No, they would not. So stop whimpering and just get on\
  \ with it.\nTo make your own putto, it is absolutely imperative that you first acquire\
  \ a grounding in the art of the Renaissance. In fact, you need more than a grounding.\
  \ Ideally, you should be able to triumph over Bernard Berenson in a quiz on the\
  \ subject. Berenson has been dead since 1959, so to prove your mettle you must consult\
  \ a backstreet medium and have him or her summon the shade of Berenson from the\
  \ Other Side. Apart from their immense knowledge of things past, present, and to\
  \ come, spectral beings from beyond the grave can be surprisingly quick on the buzzer\
  \ in tense quiz-type situations, so you should get in some fairly hefty practice.\
  \ Tecwen Whittock, whose coughing prompted correct answers from Major Charles Ingram\
  \ in the great Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? cheating affaire of 2001, and was\
  \ himself a contestant on the show, built his own homemade four-button console and\
  \ rehearsed on it for hours. This is the kind of preparation you would do well to\
  \ imitate before facing the spirit of Bernard Berenson in a Renaissance art quizathon.\n\
  Having, I hope, crushed the shade of Berenson and demonstrated your sweeping knowledge\
  \ of the subject, you will now be in a position to make your own putto. Get some\
  \ putty, mould it into a putto, give it a lick of paint, and voila!, there you have\
  \ it. One reader who tried this out was OutaSpaceman, and here is the result:\n\n\
  If you wish to make edible putti, for the decoration of cakes and pastries and so\
  \ on, you can use dough instead of putty, and food colourants instead of paint.\
  \ A generous slice of chocolate swiss roll upon which a pair of dough putti are\
  \ disporting themselves makes the perfect addition to a worker's lunchbox, and is\
  \ said to aid productivity on the factory floor, according to the nutritionist Catnip\
  \ Wedge. Wedge has been dead even longer than Bernard Berenson, but he proffered\
  \ his opinion when his phantom, bespattered rather disgustingly with an excess of\
  \ ectoplasm, was summoned by Madame Boubou, the backstreet medium I consulted.\n\
