text: "It was summer, a hot day. I was eating breakfast when I was disturbed by a\
  \ knocking at the manor gate. Pushing my lemon meringue pie to one side, I picked\
  \ up my portable aerophone, or parp, and snapped it open. I held it at arm's length,\
  \ above my head, until it locked on to my factotum, Chumpot. A chiaroscuro image\
  \ of his head, floating in a haze of static, appeared on the screen. I pressed the\
  \ parp's summoning knob and waited.\nWhile I waited, I thought about Chumpot. Days\
  \ can pass without encountering him, and I wanted to be sure it was indeed he who\
  \ answered the summons. He has been our family factotum since long before I was\
  \ born. If it is possible to be both suave and decrepit, both urbane and toothless,\
  \ that was Chumpot. Heaven knows how aged he was, or from what wood his crutches\
  \ had been fashioned.\nEventually he appeared, creaking, in the doorway. I told\
  \ him I had heard a knocking at the manor gate and would have him investigate. He\
  \ muttered something unintelligible and went away. I finished off the lemon meringue\
  \ pie and started in on a dish of bloaters. I had eaten all but one of them when\
  \ Chumpot returned, bringing with him a stranger. This fellow was nondescript, so\
  \ I shall non descript him.\n\u201CGood morning on this hot summer's day,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CI am Detective Captain Cargpan, and I have come to place you under\
  \ arrest.\u201D\nI was momentarily disconcerted, but quickly realised the copper's\
  \ error.\n\u201CYou are confusing me with Chumpot,\u201D I said, gesturing at the\
  \ factotum, \u201CHe is a member of the lower orders, the servant class, and thus\
  \ given to acts of malfeasance. By all means take him away.\u201D\n\u201CYour factotum\
  \ is as innocent as a newborn kitten,\u201D said Cargpan, \u201CIt is you I have\
  \ come for,\u201D\nAnd he spat in my eye.\n\u201CBut I have done nothing wrong!\u201D\
  \ I cried.\n\u201CAre you sure of that?\u201D said the policeman, spitting in my\
  \ other eye, \u201CThe crimes of humankind are numberless, numberless. For example,\
  \ in Thailand it is against the law for an individual to own more than one-hundred-and-twenty\
  \ playing cards.\u201D\n\u201CBut we are not in Thailand and I do not own that many\
  \ playing cards,\u201D I shot back.\n\u201CWell,\u201D said Cargpan, looking thoughtful,\
  \ \u201CThose are both matters we can look into down at the station, in the basement\
  \ interrogation chamber. We might also find out whether you have ever taken hold\
  \ of a salmon in a suspicious manner, whistled excessively, allowed a chicken to\
  \ cross a major thoroughfare, or given a pig the name Napoleon. Who knows what you\
  \ might have done in addition to the heinous enormity for which I am arresting you?\u201D\
  \nI was about to ask what that was, but Cargpan whacked me on the windpipe with\
  \ his truncheon. I saw my factotum smirking. As I gasped for breath, I was astonished\
  \ to hear the copper say \u201CExcellent work, Chumpot\u201D. Then the pair of them\
  \ bundled me none too gently out of the room and down the stairs and along the hallway\
  \ and out of the manor door and into the back of Cargpan's gleaming black police\
  \ van.\nAs we drove along bosky country lanes towards the village police station,\
  \ I experienced a shocking epiphany. Despite his suavity and urbanity, Chumpot was\
  \ a most untidy man. His clothing was ragged and filthy, his shoes were always caked\
  \ with mud, and I suspect he was a stranger to shampoo. Yet he wore pinned to his\
  \ chest a brooch, polished to a gleam every day, a gleam so bright that, when it\
  \ caught the sun, on hot summer days such as this, it flashed gash gold-vermilion,\
  \ and almost blinded the observer with its brilliance. It was an oddity, compared\
  \ with the factotum's general unseemliness, and once, long ago, I had asked him\
  \ about it.\n\u201CThis brooch belonged to my dear departed mother,\u201D he told\
  \ me, \u201CShe was a sainted woman, a paragon of virtue, a model of kindness. She\
  \ spent untold years resuscitating newborn kittens whose owners had drowned them\
  \ in the toilet. I was devoted to her. As she took her last dying breath, in the\
  \ drainage ditch where her poor withered body passed beyond this cruel world, she\
  \ pressed her brooch into my hand and made me promise to wear it every day, and\
  \ to polish it to a gleam every day, in her memory. And I have kept that promise.\
  \ I could do no other.\u201D\nI found this little speech emotionally shattering,\
  \ and I wept. And now, in the back of the police van, I was again emotionally shattered,\
  \ and again I wept. For I suddenly saw what I had been blind to for so many years.\
  \ Chumpot had lied to me. His \u201Cbrooch\u201D was a police badge!\nWell, how\
  \ was I to know? This was in the days before we all became familiar with coppers\
  \ and their ways through endless television crime dramas and police procedurals.\
  \ In any case, Chumpot was, as I had told Cargpan, a member of the servant class.\
  \ As any phrenologist will tell you, though such specimens are habitually dishonest,\
  \ they lack the intelligence necessary to embroider so credible and heart-wrenching\
  \ a tale as Chumpot's account of his dying mother.\nI was still in a state of mental\
  \ chaos when they tied me to a chair in the basement interrogation chamber and shone\
  \ a Kleig light into my eyes. From behind it, I heard the suave and urbane voice\
  \ of Chumpot, as if for the first time.\n\u201CWell, well, well,\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201CI suppose I ought to introduce myself, or reintroduce myself. I am Detective\
  \ Cadet Chumpot, though you might prefer to think of me as the Recording Angel.\
  \ I've been keeping tabs on you for years and years, since before you were born.\
  \ And in that time, I've gathered enough evidence of your unimaginably numerous\
  \ and multifarious crimes to have you banged up in chokey for a very long time indeed.\
  \ My boss, Detective Captain Cargpan, says he's never seen such a lengthy rap sheet.\
  \ I suppose we'd better make a start on it. So, in your own words, tell me about\
  \ the time you cooked and ate a mute swan that was, as you well knew, the property\
  \ of the Queen, as all mute swans are.\u201D\nAnd so began my interrogation. I confessed\
  \ to everything on that long, long list. I sang like a canary. And all the while,\
  \ in my throbbing brain, I kept asking myself\u2014what would become of that last,\
  \ uneaten bloater in my breakfast dish? That is the great question, or rather it\
  \ would be if I still had any prospect of release.\nThe first sentence, and the\
  \ last, were translated from the German by Willa and Edwin Muir. Everything in between\
  \ was not.\n[2018-03-02]"
