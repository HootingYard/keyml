text: "You will be pleased to hear that I have been indefatigable, over the last couple\
  \ of days, in my mermaid research. In a bunker deep underground, I was able to view\
  \ several hours of footage from various demonstrations, hoping to spot a committed\
  \ member of the social justice movement, in other words a mermaid, being clubbed\
  \ senseless, possibly even to death, by a brutish copper or two. Well, when I say\
  \ that is what I was hoping to see, I do not mean that I was excited by the prospect\
  \ of watching a semiaquatic being being roughed up by the forces of law and order,\
  \ rather if that is what I did see it would confirm mermaids\u2019 status as committed\
  \ members of the social justice movement. Are you still with me? This isn't particularly\
  \ complicated stuff, but I am having some difficulty explaining myself. Though I\
  \ must say it was fun to write a grammatically correct sentence containing two adjacent\
  \ \u201Cbeing\u201Ds. Anyway, to my infinite regret the footage was shaky and blurry\
  \ and I couldn't make anything out in detail, so I am still unable to reach a definitive\
  \ mermaid conclusion. What I do have, courtesy of OSM, is a photograph of a gathering\
  \ of mermaids, perhaps protesting in favour of world peace or against capitalism.\
  \ Neither George Galloway nor Annie Lennox, say, is visible in the picture, so it's\
  \ hard to be sure what exactly the mermaids are making a fuss about. Careful study\
  \ of the photo will be necessary, through a microscope, which I shall have to borrow\
  \ from my next door neighbour, a somewhat perplexing individual with cake-crumbs\
  \ in his beard. He is often reluctant to respond to my urgent hammerings at his\
  \ door, so please be patient and I will return to this important topic when I have\
  \ something concrete to report.\n\n[2009-05-08]"
