  \ summer you might spend your evenings going for long hikes before or after supper,\
  \ roaming the hills and the moors, as autumn descends you will want to close the\
  \ shutters and gather round a blazing fire, pater and mater familias and your bewildering\
  \ number of tinies. And on such evenings, even reading aloud lengthy passages from\
  \ the Bible can pall, so you will want other resources, and what could be better\
  \ than a diverting parlour game?\nTo play Poop Or Orlop? (sometimes known as Orlop\
  \ Or Poop?) all you need is a supply of cardboard and some string and some glue.\
  \ One member of the family is designated as the \u201CAdmiral\u201D (if you are\
  \ upper class), the \u201CCaptain\u201D (if you are middle class) or the \u201C\
  Skipper\u201D (if you are working class). Everyone else leaves the parlour and gathers\
  \ crammed in the pantry for an hour or so. The \u201CAdmiral\u201D or \u201CCaptain\u201D\
  \ or \u201CSkipper\u201D uses this time, and the cardboard and the string and the\
  \ glue, to transform the parlour into a nautically-accurate poop or orlop deck.\n\
  When the rest of the family returns from the pantry, each in turn must use skill,\
  \ judgement, and knowledge of ship construction to declare whether the parlour is\
  \ now a poop deck or an orlop deck. Those who decide correctly are treated to a\
  \ \u201Cfeast at the captain's table\u201D, that is, they are each allowed to go\
  \ back to the pantry and choose a snack from among the snack items on the pantry\
  \ shelves. Those who decide incorrectly are \u201Ctossed into the sea\u201D, that\
  \ is, they must clamber out of the open window and wait shivering in the garden\
  \ until the next round.\nThe \u201CAdmiral\u201D or \u201CCaptain\u201D or \u201C\
  Skipper\u201D then dismantles the cardboard and string and glue poop or orlop deck\
  \ and returns the parlour to its pristine condition. The winners come back from\
  \ the pantry stuffed with sausages or pies or fruit, and the losers climb back in\
  \ through the window, and someone else is designated as the \u201CAdmiral\u201D\
  \ or \u201CCaptain\u201D or \u201CSkipper\u201D and the game begins again.\n[2011-11-06]"
