text: "Older readers will recall House Of Turps as an out of print pamphlet published\
  \ by the Malice Aforethought Press in 1989. That's how I recall it myself. But yesterday,\
  \ rummaging in a midden, I came upon several sheets of buff paper, the typed manuscript\
  \ of a piece also called House Of Turps. It bears no resemblance to the published\
  \ text. It is the \u201CPrologue\u201D to what I clearly intended as a lengthy narrative\
  \ poem which, equally clearly, I thereafter abandoned. For the benefit of scholars\
  \ who, I know, devote their waking lives to poring over every syllable I have ever\
  \ written, here is that fragment of the lost (until yesterday) House Of Turps \u2026\
  \n\n\_Welcome to the House of Turps,\n  Riddled with visionaries, idiots, twerps,\n\
  \  Bores, poltroons, maniacs, cranks,\n  Of the highest and the lowest ranks;\n\
  \  Raised and ruined, rich and poor \u2013\n  What brings them all to the same door?\n\
  \  A vision of a visionary world.\nEach year a pennant is unfurled\n  From the very\
  \ top of the House's walls,\n  In howling wind, as the mercury falls,\n  As winter\
  \ bites. Ice grips the land.\n  Each member of our demented band\n  Bids fare thee\
  \ well to home, kith, kin,\n  And with a doomed and gritty grin\n  Sets forth upon\
  \ a long slow trudge\n  Towards a circular bank of sludge.\n  This sludge-bank bars\
  \ the trudgers\u2019 way.\n  To cross it takes near half a day,\n  Weighed down\
  \ by netting, pig-iron shoes,\n  Tourniquets, gum, a supply of booze,\n  Branches,\
  \ forks, baize and bait \u2013\n  All gifts for the Keeper at the gate,\n  The unfurler\
  \ of the Winter Flag.\n  He's eighty-nine. His name is Cragg.\n  The House of Turps\
  \ depends on him.\n  His countenance is pale and grim.\n  His history's shadowy\
  \ and obscure.\n  He's lived here since the age of four.\nAs each guest lurches\
  \ from the slime\n  Cragg makes a note of name and time\n  Scraped on the page with\
  \ a blood-stained hook\n  In his huge registration book.\n  He slams it shut then\
  \ barks: \u201CGo flee\n  To room nineteen!\u201D or \u201Ctwenty-three!\u201D.\n\
  \  The guests head off on a path of gravel\n  For they have not yet ceased to travel.\n\
  \  The House looms a further six miles\u2019 trudge\n  Over gravel and pebbles,\
  \ not slime or sludge.\n  Cragg remains, hard by the gate,\n  Until he's counted\
  \ in all eight.\n  We'll leave him there, improbably dressed,\n  As we consider\
  \ each mad guest.\nPOTATO SMITH is sick at heart,\n  Festooned with rotten sacking.\n\
  \  He made a fortune in fine art.\n  His sense of humour's lacking.\n  Curt and\
  \ shrivelled, eighty-five,\n  He likes to suck wood-splinters.\n  He is only just\
  \ alive,\n  But comes here every winter.\nPRIMROSE LEEK, a friend to ants,\n  Is\
  \ only thirty-two.\n  She wears black hat, black coat, black pants,\n  She's also\
  \ known as Sue.\n  Though dumb in summer, at the House\n  She speaks the lingua\
  \ franca.\n  She murdered Hector Lockjaw Frowse,\n  The international banker.\n\
  Then there's DR RUFUS GLUBB,\n  The noted bandage-stainer.\n  His head looks like\
  \ a bakelite tub\n  Topped by a bent tea-strainer.\n  His belly has grown to a pot\n\
  \  From eating too much custard.\n  The other guests loathe him a lot\n  But think\
  \ he cuts the mustard.\nOur fourth pal has a widow's peak,\n  Looks not unlike a\
  \ panda.\n  C. T. PUCK's part-Dutch, part-Greek,\n  Half-blind and part-Greenlander.\n\
  \  She lives on a diet of gruel and slops\n  And vats of sour beer.\n  You can't\
  \ buy those things in the shops,\n  But Cragg supplies them here.\nLASCELLES DISTEMPER\
  \ JARLEY\n  Has no sense of direction.\n  He is a proper Charlie\n  And has a cork\
  \ collection.\n  He says \u201Cby Jove!\u201D and \u201Cgolly gosh!\u201D\n  And\
  \ other dumbkopf phrases.\n  He talks a huge amount of tosh\n  And he is prone to\
  \ crazes.\nOLD DOGMOUTH's fits are legion.\n  He broke his wooden legs.\n  Like\
  \ others from his region\n  He sets fire to hard-boiled eggs.\n  Cragg and he are\
  \ so alike\n  They could share the same mother,\n  But Cragg was once an orphan\
  \ tyke\n  And Dogmouth has no brother.\nSISTER GERTIE of the Cross\n  Is a religious\
  \ nutter.\n  She roams the land astride her \u201CHoss\u201D,\n  A goat, a fractious\
  \ butter.\n  Moths have fluttered round her head,\n  Its incandescent light\n  Proof\
  \ that she is not quite dead\n  But shining, dazzling bright.\nThe last of the guests\
  \ at the turpentine House\n  Has crutches painted yellow.\n  His head is cracked,\
  \ he's such a louse,\n  He's such a grotesque fellow.\n  Watch him grow warts upon\
  \ his ears,\n  Watch him act agitator.\n  He's quite as vile as he appears \u2013\
  \n  NED HELLHOUND, your narrator.\nSo now we've met this motley crew,\n  On with\
  \ our tale of derring-do.\n[2017-10-01]"
