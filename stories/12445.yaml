text: "Nappa Gisburn brought to my attention a television programme entitled Lobstermen\_\
  : Jeopardy At Sea, screened on something called the Quest Channel. I did not see\
  \ it, but then, as Mr Gisburn himself noted, it was probably less exciting than\
  \ its title promised.\nIt served to remind me, however, that some years ago I encouraged\
  \ readers to join the Adopt A Lobster scheme. Some of you in fact did so, and have\
  \ the certificates to prove it. What I find both worrying and perplexing is that\
  \ nobody seems ever to have received any news of their lobster. Much as I would\
  \ like to think that Babinsky and Bobnit Tivol and Tiny Enid are scuttling happily\
  \ across the ocean floor, snapping their claws at minnows, I just don't know, and\
  \ it's the not knowing that leads me to lie awake at night, thrashing around on\
  \ my pallet, biting my pillow, and generally making a sorry spectacle of myself.\n\
  Readers will recall that I undertook a special study of lobsters and consider myself,\
  \ if not an expert, than certainly as someone qualified to embark on a worldwide\
  \ lecture tour, all expenses paid. Should you, or anybody you know, wish to invite\
  \ me to some far-flung yet luxurious corner of the globe, and to put me up in an\
  \ exquisite hotel for a week, I will be happy to deliver a five- or ten-minute unillustrated\
  \ lecture on lobsters while waving my arms about in a foolish, hysterical manner.\n\
