  \ \u201CBroadsword\u201D nor \u201CDanny Boy\u201D has been used, these of course\
  \ being the codenames spectacularly en-un-cia-ted by Richard Burton (for himself\
  \ and the great Michael Hordern) in Where Eagles Dare (1968). Still, at least I\
  \ now know to refer to Richard Milhous Nixon as \u201CSearchlight\u201D in future.\n\
