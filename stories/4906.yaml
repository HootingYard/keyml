text: "So there I was, thinking that in Austin Osman Spare I had found my go-to guy\
  \ for curses, imprecations and anathemas. That was until I came upon the Scots poet\
  \ Allan Ramsay (1686\u20131758), of whom I was only dimly aware.\nWhat happened\
  \ was this. It occurred to me this afternoon that it was a matter of utmost urgency\
  \ that I discover the etymology of \u201Cfrogman\u201D, specifically whether, at\
  \ any point, the word \u201Ctoadman\u201D had been preferred. As always happens\
  \ as soon as one consults the Oxford English Dictionary, I was blown off course.\
  \ My attention was caught by \u201Cfrogland\u201D, which is defined, not unexpectedly,\
  \ as \u201Cmarshy land in which frogs abound, as the Fens, Holland, etc.\u201D The\
  \ first of a mere two citations in the OED is \u201C1721 RAMSAY Tartana xxxiii,\
  \ May she be curst to starve in frogland fens.\u201D\nMy curiosity was piqued. Who\
  \ was she and what had she done to deserve so awful a fate? I soon found an online\
  \ edition of Allan Ramsay's Poems of 1721 and read:\nMay she be curst to starve\
  \ in Frogland Fens, / To wear a Fala ragg'd at both the Ends, / Groan still beneath\
  \ an antiquated Suit, / And die a Maid at fifty five to boot ; / May she turn quaggy\
  \ Fat, or crooked Dwarff, / Be ridicul'd while primm'd up in her Scarff ; / May\
  \ Spleen and Spite still keep her on the Fret, / And live till she outlive her Beauty's\
  \ Date ; / May all this fall, and more than I have said, / Upon that wench who disregards\
  \ the Plaid.\nGosh. This strikes me as a somewhat hysterical overreaction to someone\
  \ eschewing the wearing of tartan, but then I am not a mad Scotsman, so what do\
  \ I know?\n[2010-08-01]"
