text: "And still the onward march of Hooting Yard into every nook and cranny in the\
  \ universe continues, unstoppable! The latest place we have wormed our way into\
  \ is the Public Domain Review, a project of the Open Knowledge Foundation. The Public\
  \ Domain Review is, as it says, \u201Cexactly what it says on the tin: a web-based\
  \ review of works which have entered the public domain. Each week an invited contributor\
  \ presents an interesting or curious work with a brief accompanying text giving\
  \ context, commentary and criticism.\u201D\nThis week's invited contributor is your\
  \ very own Mr Key, who was asked to write a brief piece introducing that inimitable\
  \ masterpiece Jubilate Agno. The lovely people at the Review have added the audio\
  \ of the legendary ResonanceFM recording (an outtake of which appeared here the\
  \ other day), so now you know exactly what to do with the next three hours of your\
  \ nasty, brutish and short life.\nADDENDUM\_: On the subject of global dominion,\
  \ WordPress keeps me alerted to mentions of Hooting Yard wherever and whenever they\
  \ occur. And today, I am pleased\u2014albeit rather beflummoxed\u2014to learn that\
  \ Unthinkable Consulting, on its \u2018delicious\u2019 feed, recommends the \u201C\
  offbeat brilliance\u201D of Hooting Yard, \u201Can example of a gift-based literary\
  \ business model\u201D. Well, at long bloody last. Ever since I started tippy-tapping\
  \ the contents of this website over seven years ago, I have been waiting for somebody\
  \ to acknowledge that, all along, I have been constructing a gift-based literary\
  \ business model, daddy-o.\n[2011-01-31]"
