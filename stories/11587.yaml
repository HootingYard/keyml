text: "Clearly the contemplation of my juvenilia has discombobulated me. Since reading,\
  \ then posting, the opening paragraph of \u201C-En\u201D on Sunday, I have found\
  \ myself unable to write a word. With last year's experiment of bashing out a thousand\
  \ words a day, I thought I had proved, at least in my own case, that \u201Cwriter's\
  \ block\u201D was a convenient myth we tell ourselves so we can spend more time\
  \ staring out of the window in blissful idleness. Yet it appears that such blocks\
  \ do exist, even for me!\nI think, however, that I have hit upon the nub of the\
  \ problem. Contained in the text of \u201C-En\u201D is that resounding trio of sentences\
  \ \u201CPole to pole. Hole to hole. Mole to mole.\u201D Weirdly, these words haunt\
  \ me. They make no sense, or at least no sense that I can ascertain some forty years\
  \ after I wrote them. But I am strangely exercised by the thought that somewhere\
  \ along the line I took a wrong turning, and it is sentences like these I ought\
  \ to have been writing all these years. Coal to coal. Soul to soul. Bowl to bowl.\n\
  It occurs to me, of course, that had I stuck to my guns I may not have gained the\
  \ readership I have, such as it is. There is only so far one can take the method,\
  \ and one need not take it far at all before boring the reader into stupefaction.\
  \ But is not a kind of hypnagogic stupefaction a worthy aim for a writer to cast\
  \ over his readers? It might be, you know, it very well might be.\nFor guidance\
  \ on the matter I turned, as ever, to Dobson, the twentieth century's titanic out\
  \ of print pamphleteer. In his pamphlet Stringing A Few Words Together To No Apparent\
  \ Purpose (out of print), he has this to say:\nStringing a few words together to\
  \ no apparent purpose, to the possible stupefaction of one's readers, is a worthy\
  \ aim. Blunt screw fleck. Calmative pin-cushion rosette. Smelly little penguins.\
  \ See? It can work wonders. Now I am going to take a nap.\nNow I am going to take\
  \ a nap.\n[2013-06-12]"
