text: "For no pressing reason\u2014a note to myself as much as anything\u2014I thought\
  \ I would post the names of the months of the French revolutionary calendar, together\
  \ with the information that they were devised by Fabre d\u2019\xC9glantine, poet\
  \ and dramatist, who ended up under the guillotine (there's a surprise) and that\
  \ the calendar itself was in use from November 1793 until the end of 1805, although\
  \ it was deemed to have begun on 22 September 1792. So, those months then:\nVend\xE9\
  miaire, Brumaire, Frimaire, Niv\xF4se, Pluvi\xF4se, Vent\xF4se, Germinal, Flor\xE9\
  al, Prairial, Messidor, Thermidor, Fructidor.\nI have absolutely no idea how those\
  \ names translate into Esperanto, but I suppose if you bung an \u201Co\u201D on\
  \ at the end of each you won't go far wrong.\nADDENDUM\_: Mention of the guillotine\
  \ leads me to add that the first models of the new improved execution engine were\
  \ constructed by Tobias Schmidt, by trade a maker of harpsichords.\n[2010-01-05]"
