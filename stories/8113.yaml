text: "The other day, as I was wending my way along the city streets, I saw, on the\
  \ back of a passing bus, an advertisement for a product called Feroglobin.\n\nI\
  \ have since learned that this is an iron supplement for the formation of haemoglobin.\
  \ But it seems to me that a moving vehicle is not an advisable place to advertise\
  \ it, for one glances at the poster, and before one has a chance to read it properly,\
  \ away growls the bus, out of the range of one's vision, or at least of my, myopic,\
  \ vision. I would have liked more time to scrutinise the advertisement, for on that\
  \ first glance I misread it as Ferogoblin. I then spent rather a lot of time wondering\
  \ (a) what in the name of heaven a Ferogoblin might be, and (b) why it was advertising\
  \ itself on the back of a bus. My mind reeled.\nReaders may recall that almost exactly\
  \ a year ago I wrote here about the official colour coding system for goblins. To\
  \ recap briefly, the agreed categories are as follows:\nRed\_: Hobgoblins.\nOrange\_\
  : Fat Goblins.\nYellow\_: Pilfering Goblins.\nGreen\_: Teutonic Forest Goblins.\n\
  Blue\_: Goblins found under sinks.\nIndigo\_: Wet Goblins.\nViolet\_: All other\
  \ goblins not classified above.\nAccording to this list, Ferogoblins\u2014which\
  \ I take to be a contraction of Feral Goblins\u2014must be included in the \u201C\
  all other goblins not classified above\u201D subset, unless of course there are\
  \ goblins which are both feral and hob, or feral and fat, or feral and given to\
  \ pilfering, or feral and dwelling in Teutonic forests, or feral and found under\
  \ sinks, or feral and wet. I suppose such goblins might well exist. But for the\
  \ sake of argument, and because it is tidier, let us assume there is a discrete\
  \ type of goblin known as the feral or fero-goblin. Logically, then, it must fall\
  \ within the \u201Call other goblins\u201D category, which would mean code violet.\
  \ Yet intuition, and indeed common sense, tell us that violet is not at all the\
  \ most suitable colour for a feral goblin. In fact it seems utterly inappropriate,\
  \ the sort of colour one might only apply to a feral goblin in a world turned upside\
  \ down, a topsy turvy world of chaos and confusion.\nThis insight leads us to the\
  \ startling conclusion that feral goblins must therefore be somehow outwith the\
  \ known colour spectrum. Imagine that! I told you my mind was already reeling, and\
  \ now it reeled even more. It perhaps also accounts for their feral nature, that\
  \ they may be untamed and prone to havoc on account of being set apart from the\
  \ normal run of goblins. Such alienation can cause low self-esteem, as we have learned\
  \ from many addle-brained social psychologists in recent decades. What could be\
  \ more damaging to a sense of goblin selfhood than to be forever banished, by one's\
  \ very nature, from the visible colour spectrum? It is a harsh fate indeed, so no\
  \ wonder they turn feral.\nHowever, I was clearly thinking along the right tracks,\
  \ because so terrible a social stigma could well account for feral goblins advertising\
  \ their existence on the backs of buses. It is one way to get yourself noticed,\
  \ as the producers of several dire West End musicals have discovered. But an advertisement\
  \ on the back of a bus does not come cheap, and one wonders how the feral goblins\
  \ raised the necessary cash. My guess is that they were in cahoots with the pilfering\
  \ goblins (code yellow), who diverted a proportion of their ill-gotten gains to\
  \ the feral goblins in return for the Lord knows what maleficent favours. Being\
  \ feral, the feral goblins may have agreed to, for example, gnaw and slash at and\
  \ scratch and screech at innocent passers-by, terrorising them into a state of paralysing\
  \ fear so that the pilfering goblins could come leaping down from the rooftops and\
  \ make away with their wallets and purses and cashboxes. No doubt the two groups\
  \ would then meet in a secluded goblins\u2019 nest to divvy up the proceeds.\nThis\
  \ does raise the question of the bus operators\u2019 willingness to accept advertising\
  \ on the backs of its buses from such nefarious clients. Or, let us say, it would\
  \ raise that question were it not the case that I misread the advertisement, which\
  \ turned out to have not a jot to do with goblins whatsoever. You live and learn.\n\
