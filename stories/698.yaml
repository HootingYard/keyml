text: "Sedgeweg, a crony of the Tuppers, had many toppings. Some of them were like\
  \ lids and some like caps. One of particular note was the flat one, the one that\
  \ decisively lacked fizz. That was unusual, but not unexpected, for Sedgeweg was\
  \ a ringer, and a Tewkeston one at that, with the distinctive old red shawl and\
  \ the calipers. His grip was firm, you could say that for him, and you could say\
  \ much else. People did. Take a walk along the bridle path one morning, just after\
  \ dawn, and you will hear of little else. Even the birds making a birdy dawn din\
  \ seem to call out his name, although of course that is just our human fancy at\
  \ work. Any bridle path hereabouts will be the same, in the mornings, crowded with\
  \ folk who've risen early from their beds, wandering out of doors like sleepwalkers,\
  \ heading nowhere in particular, with no particular business. It may be the pong\
  \ of the bridle paths that attracts them, in their dozens, woken from dreams of\
  \ pigs upon gravel, always the same dream, shared by so many, it is quite a wonder.\
  \ After all, this is not pig country, hasn't been for a hundred years or so, long\
  \ before Sedgeweg's time. By the time he came along it was all geese, or otters,\
  \ or just vast tracts of cement. His parents had both been among those who poured\
  \ the cement, without much in the way of skill, but with enthusiasm. You need to\
  \ be keen to perform certain actions, when you've not been apprenticed to them.\
  \ But Sedgeweg knew ringing backwards, he'd been trained to it. Lots were, once.\
  \ You'd be surprised how readily he took to it, all things considered, by which\
  \ \u2018things\u2019 I mean his dumps and flops and clownishness. Each in turn he\
  \ struggled with, but defeated. He was a decent man. Some, on the bridle path of\
  \ a morning, have it that he cannot count and never could, but they are wrong. A\
  \ ringer unable to count would be a strange creature indeed, as strange in its own\
  \ way as those otters that now prevail where once the pigs held sway. They are not\
  \ quite like any other otters, or at least any you are likely to chance upon at\
  \ a standard riverbank. Take your binoculars or a telescope and have a look, you'll\
  \ see what I mean.\_\n[2008-10-07]"
