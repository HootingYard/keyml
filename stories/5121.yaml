text: "\u201CIn the beginning of the eighteenth century the great-grandfather of the\
  \ famous Lord Macaulay, the author of the glowing and impassioned History of England,\
  \ was minister of Tiree and Coll, when his stipend was taken from him at the instance\
  \ of the Laird of Ardchattan. The slight inconvenience of having nothing to live\
  \ upon did not seem to incline the old minister in the least degree to resign his\
  \ charge and to seek a flock who could feed their shepherd. He stayed valiantly\
  \ on, doing his duty faithfully by his humble people. But after some time had elapsed,\
  \ \u2018his health being much impaired, and there being no church or meeting-house,\
  \ he was exposed to the violence of the weather at all seasons; and having no manse\
  \ or glebe, and no fund for communion elements, and having no mortification for\
  \ schools or other pious purposes in either of the islands, and the air being unwholesome,\u2019\
  \u2014he was finally compelled to leave, much to his own regret and that of his\
  \ poor little flock.\u201D\nHattie Tyng Griswold, Home Life Of Great Authors (1886)\n\
