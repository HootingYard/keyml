text: "I regret to say that yesterday we overlooked an important anniversary here\
  \ at Hooting Yard. I refer not to the birthdays of Gilbert White (1720) or Tristan\
  \ Corbi\xE8re (1845), nor to the shuffling from this mortal coil of Machine Gun\
  \ Kelly (1954). Nor am I even drawing to your attention the incident at Chappaquiddick\
  \ (1969), though you may very well expect me to.\nNo, what we ought to have celebrated\
  \ yesterday with flags and bunting and possibly a primitive blood sacrifice was\
  \ the tenth anniversary of the first ever batch of smokers\u2019 poptarts going\
  \ on sale. This toothsome \u201Cbreakfast solution\u201D is rightly celebrated by\
  \ smokers and poptart lovers throughout the world, or what passes for the world\
  \ when seen through a fug of dense Madagascan cigarette smoke.\nTo commemorate what\
  \ social historians are already calling \u201Cthe smokers\u2019 poptart decade\u201D\
  , the manufacturers are issuing celebratory packets of brand new Wafer-Thin Organic\
  \ Potato-Trifle-Flavour Rectangular Ready-Toasted Smokers\u2019 Poptarts, including\
  \ a free gift with every purchase of a poptart-shaped ashtray made of unbaked clay\
  \ from the spooky quarry on Blodgett Island.\nLegally inescapable health warnings\
  \ on the packaging have been artfully subverted, thanks to top mezzotintist Rex\
  \ Tint, whose design incorporates mezzotints showing noteworthy historical figures\
  \ simultaneously smoking and stuffing smokers\u2019 poptarts down their gullets.\n\
