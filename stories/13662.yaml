text: "Hooting Yard has now been a presence on what Tony Blair and I like to call\
  \ the Information Superhighway for more than a decade. It is an arresting thought\
  \ that the site has existed for a longer period of time than that required by a\
  \ Jesuit to completely brainwash a child. This startling fact prompts two further\
  \ thoughts, today. First, I am minded to add a slogan to that red rectangle at the\
  \ top, saying \u201CDispensing prose to hoi polloi since 2003\u201D. Second, that\
  \ on a day such as this, when my brain is empty, I can hark back ten years and repost\
  \ something from so long ago that it is unlikely any of you lot will remember it.\
  \ I certainly don't. Exactly ten years ago, on 11 January 2005, this piece appeared\
  \ under the unwieldy title First Spruce, Now Rusty And Squalid. For this reappearance\
  \ I have taken the opportunity to insert a few paragraph breaks to make for easier\
  \ reading. I am sure you can think of a way to show your gratitude for such thoughtfulness.\n\
  Consider that fall. One day, you are spry, preening and spruce. Then, knocked sideways,\
  \ cast down, become rusty and squalid. How does it happen? Is there a moment, a\
  \ split second, when jauntiness turns to sackcloth and ashes? What would your journal\
  \ read?\nEleven a.m.\_: o! such bliss and splendour! How blessed am I to be among\
  \ the animate and quick.\nEleven o one a.m.: Ach! Does earth harbour a wretch as\
  \ miserable as I, one who crumbles in despair and is fit only to slither in the\
  \ muck with the worms?\nHow are we to make sense of such a catastrophic change?\
  \ Crystal balls may help seers and soothsayers see into the future, but is it true,\
  \ as some say, that we can make sense of the present by staring long and intently\
  \ with our eyes wide open at the surface of a muddy pond over by Bodger's Spinney?\
  \ And not any of the ponds there, just one, the most brackish of the ponds, the\
  \ one which is inky black and fathomless. What will we see on the surface of that\
  \ pond if we stare at it long enough?\nI will tell you. Ignore the flies and mosquitoes\
  \ and the mutant tadpoles that occasionally disturb the water, and sooner or later,\
  \ you will be able to discern, dimly at first, but with increasing clarity, the\
  \ incredible face of the Psychopond Dweller, shimmering, gaunt, bewitched and bewitching,\
  \ and its expression will reveal to you the meaning of neither past nor future but\
  \ of the present moment, radical, decisive and, like the cockles and mussels in\
  \ the old song, alive, alive-oh.\n[2015-01-11]"
