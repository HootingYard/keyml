text: "\nThe Raid On Entebbe (disambiguation).\nThe Raid On Entebbe can refer to\_\
  :\na hostage-rescue mission carried out by commandos of the Israeli Defence Force\
  \ at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on 4 July 1976;\na 1977 film dramatisation of the\
  \ incident starring Peter Finch (whose surname is also the common term for medium-sized\
  \ passerine birds in the family Fringillidae);\nthe given name of a pet hamster\
  \ kept by the potboiling paperbackist Pebblehead.\nPebblehead was once asked in\
  \ an interview why he had named his hamster The Raid On Entebbe. This is what he\
  \ said by way of reply:\n\u201CI don't know what you're talking about. I haven't\
  \ got a pet hamster. I grant you, there is a small cage over there, fitted with\
  \ a wheel for a small mammal to run around on like a mad thing, and lined with excelsior,\
  \ or wood wool, for the comfort of such a small mammal, and, yes, there is a strong\
  \ hamstery odour in the vicinity of the cage. But I challenge you to show me an\
  \ actual hamster.\u201D\nThus challenged, the journalist interviewing Pebblehead\
  \ pointed to what looked undoubtedly like a hamster, nestling in the corner of the\
  \ cage, almost covered in excelsior, and fast asleep.\n\u201CBlimey!\u201D said\
  \ Pebblehead, \u201CWhere did that come from?\u201D\nA press statement was later\
  \ issued on Pebblehead's behalf by a crack team of brain-doctors.\n\u201CFor some\
  \ time now, Pebblehead has been suffering from what the medical profession terms\
  \ intermittent hamster-blindness. The condition is debilitating and incurable, although\
  \ the symptoms can be alleviated with a combination of intravenous drugs, eye drops,\
  \ and frenzied activity, for example, bashing out potboilers on a typewriter at\
  \ the rate of several novels a week. Incidentally, all of us have previously served\
  \ as commandos in the Israeli Defence Force, so if you know of any hostages who\
  \ need to be rescued from African airfields, do drop us a line.\u201D\nPebblehead's\
  \ latest potboiler, Invisible Hamster Mayhem!, is now available from all good petshops.\n\
