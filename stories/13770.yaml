text: "When James Newell Osterberg Jr was a tiny infant, he was fed on a diet of mashed\
  \ up pap made from eggs. It was the piquant memory of these slops that informed\
  \ his later decision, when embarking upon a career as a musical performer, to adopt\
  \ the pseudonym Eggy Pap. A typographic error\u2014or rather two typographic errors\u2014\
  rendered the name differently on the label of his first vinyl waxing. Deploying\
  \ one of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies avant la lettre, Osterberg determined to\
  \ \u201Chonour [his] error as a hidden intention\u201D, and retained the inaccurate\
  \ pseudonym throughout his subsequent career.\n[2015-02-03]"
