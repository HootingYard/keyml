text: "Once upon a time there was a groovy janitor. That is about all there is to\
  \ say about him. He was groovy, and he was a janitor. Or, he was a janitor, and\
  \ he was groovy. These two statements are not identical. We must be alert to nuance.\
  \ Do we give more or less weight to his janitordom or to his grooviness? Much as\
  \ we might wish to grant them equal importance, we know in our heart of hearts that\
  \ to do so is blind idiocy. Oh come on, admit it. You are leaning, even if only\
  \ slightly, in terms of your level of interest in this majestic piece of prose,\
  \ towards the janitoriness or the groove.\nAs a janitor, the groovy janitor was\
  \ often to be found in a corridor, with a mop and a pail, rattling a bunch of keys,\
  \ or perhaps bearing down upon a fixture or fitting armed with a hammer or a screwdriver\
  \ or a wrench. As a person of groove, the groovy janitor, while so engaged, would\
  \ often be snapping his fingers to the latest sounds from some of our top beat groups,\
  \ a long but not exhaustive list of which has been compiled by Bernard Levin. Shall\
  \ we refamiliarise ourselves with the roll call?\nSome [beat groups] were almost\
  \ as famous, and successful, as the Beatles; some were known only to the most devoted\
  \ aficionados. But all added to the atmosphere of the decade, and the isle was full\
  \ of noises as never before, coming from, among others, the Rolling Stones, the\
  \ Bee Gees, the Monkees, the Doors, the Cream, the Mothers of Invention, the Seekers,\
  \ the Who, the Small Faces, the Pretty Things, the Animals, the Pink Floyd, the\
  \ Scaffold, the Grateful Dead, the Tremoloes, the Family, the Supremes, the Holding\
  \ Company, the Four Tops, the Led Zeppelin, the Shadows, the Exploding Galaxy, the\
  \ Editors, the Fugs, the Gods, the Kinks, the Hermits, the Paper Dolls, the Breakaways,\
  \ the Greaseband, the Casuals, the Amen Corner, the Big Sound, the Flirtations,\
  \ the Herd, the Marbles, the Status Quo, the New York Public Library, the Hollies,\
  \ the Foundations, the Electric Havens, the Four Seasons, the Bachelors, the Seychelles,\
  \ the Love Affair, the Fifth Dimension, the Three Dog Night, the Equals, the Vagabonds,\
  \ the Marmalade, the Mindbenders, the Moody Blues, the Mirettes, the Tuesday's Children,\
  \ the Plastic Penny, the Procol Harum, the Troggs, the Fruit Machine, the Union\
  \ Gap, the 1910 Fruitgum Co., the Beach Boys, the Fairport Convention, the Vanity\
  \ Fair, the Harmony Grass, the Aces, the Young Tradition, the Nice, the Dubliners,\
  \ the Tinkers, the Fleetwood Mac, the Incredible String Band, the Web, the Little\
  \ Free Rock, the Blodwyn Pig, the Liverpool Scene, the Spooky Tooth, the Third Ear,\
  \ the High Tide, the Mamas and Papas, the Carnations, the Pacemakers, the From Genesis\
  \ to Revelation, the O'Hara Express, the Pentangle, the Chickenshack, the Blind\
  \ Faith, the Fourmost, the Searchers, the Four Pennies, the Bar-Kays, the Unit Four\
  \ Plus Two, the Hedgehoppers Anonymous, the Applejacks, the Box Tops, the Edison\
  \ Lighthouse, the Blood, Sweat and Tears, the Vibrations, and the Rada Krishna Temple.\n\
  From this we can adduce that our groovy janitor was being groovy, and a janitor,\
  \ in the 1960s. But that was half a century ago! He is fifty years older now, creaking,\
  \ wrinkle-rutted, near bald and toothless, gasping weakly from a bed in a Mercy\
  \ Home. It is no longer accurate to describe him as a janitor, for he has carried\
  \ out no janitorial duties for twenty years at least. We can call him an ex-janitor,\
  \ or a retired janitor. And what of his grooviness? Is he still groovy? Let us ask\
  \ the superintendent of the Mercy Home, Mrs Pantoofle.\n\u201CThe retired janitor\
  \ lying sprawled in his iron cot in Hopeless Ward? You are asking me if he is groovy?\
  \ Define your terms, please.\u201D\nWe set out for her the chief characteristics\
  \ of grooviness, in alphabetical order, supported by illustrative diagrams we have\
  \ tucked in our pocket for just such an eventuality.\n\u201CI see,\u201D says Mrs\
  \ Pantoofle, though as she is wearing a pair of very stylish mirror sunglasses we\
  \ cannot be sure of the truth of this remark.\n\u201CI would say,\u201D she continues,\
  \ \u201CTaking everything into account, that the ex-janitor has indeed retained\
  \ his grooviness. Only the other morning, as one of the skivvies attended to his\
  \ bedpan, she noted that he was babbling incoherently in his weak and reedy voice.\
  \ With great presence of mind, she made a tape of his gibbering on the Mercy Home\
  \ cassette recorder. We played it back during the staff meeting at lunchtime, while\
  \ eating fruit. At first the tape yielded nothing intelligible, but when we pricked\
  \ up our ears and concentrated very hard, we realised the retired janitor was reciting\
  \ \u201CHowl\u201D by Allen Ginsberg. What could be groovier than that? It fried\
  \ my wig, daddy-o!\u201D\nThe moral of this story is that, while janitordom may\
  \ fade away and vanish, grooviness prevails. Let that be a lesson to you.\n[2017-01-19]"
