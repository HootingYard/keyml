text: "Once there were two of us little goatherds in the wood, and were talking of\
  \ various childish things: amongst others we wished that we could fly, for then\
  \ we would fly out of the mountain to Germany (for so Switzerland was called in\
  \ St. Gall). On a sudden came a frightfully large bird darting down upon us, so\
  \ that we thought it was going to carry one or both of us away. At this we both\
  \ began to scream, and to defend ourselves with our shepherd's crooks, and to cross\
  \ ourselves, till the bird flew away; then we said to one another, \u201CWe have\
  \ done wrong in wishing to be able to fly; God did not create us for flying, but\
  \ for walking.\u201D Another time I was in a very deep fissure looking for crystals,\
  \ of which many were found in it. All at once I saw a stone as large as an oven\
  \ starting from the side, and as I had no time to get out of the way, I stooped\
  \ down upon my face. The stone fell several fathoms down to a spot above me, and\
  \ from thence it made a spring away over me, so that I escaped with a whole skin.\
  \ I had plenty of such joys and happiness on the mountains among the goats, of which\
  \ I now remember nothing more.\nfrom The Autobiography Of Thomas Platter, A Schoolmaster\
  \ Of The Sixteenth Century, Translated From The German By Mrs Finn (1847)\n[2011-12-23]"
