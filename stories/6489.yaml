text: "\u2026 speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young\
  \ writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical\
  \ ideas of Friedrich Schelling, and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine,\
  \ perhaps best translated as \u2018science mysticism\u2019, defined the entire natural\
  \ world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity\
  \ as a series of \u2018polarities\u2019. According to Schelling's doctrine, the\
  \ whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical\
  \ objects \u2018aspired\u2019 to become something higher. There was a \u2018world-soul\u2019\
  \ constantly \u2018evolving\u2019 higher life forms and \u2018levels of consciousness\u2019\
  \ in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards\
  \ a higher state.\nSo carbon for example \u2018aspired\u2019 to become diamond;\
  \ plants aspired to become sentient animals; animals aspired to become men; men\
  \ aspired to become part of the Zeitgeist or world spirit. Evolutionary, idealist,\
  \ electrical and Vitalist ideas were all evidently tangled up in this system, which\
  \ had an obvious appeal to imaginative writers in the Jena circle like Novalis,\
  \ Schiller and Goethe, as well as experimental physiologists like Johann Ritter.\
  \ It had its attractions, not least in its optimism and its sense of reverence for\
  \ the natural world. But it also constantly teetered on the brink of idiocy. One\
  \ of its wilder proselytisers, the Scandinavian geologist Henrick Steffens, was\
  \ said to have stated that \u2018The diamond is a piece of carbon that has come\
  \ to its senses\u2019; to which a Scottish geologist, probably John Playfair, made\
  \ the legendary reply: \u2018Then a quartz, therefore, must be a diamond run mad\u2019\
  .\nRichard Holmes, The Age Of Wonder\_: How The Romantic Generation Discovered The\
  \ Beauty And Terror Of Science (2008). In some ways the joys of this book are encapsulated\
  \ in a single brief sentence on page 273:\nThe Anti-Jacobin magazine made a more\
  \ general link between radical politics, inhaling gas, flying balloons and mesmerism.\n\
