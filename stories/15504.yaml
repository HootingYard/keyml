text: "Dear Mr Key, writes rock \u2018n\u2019 pop critic Rick Rockpopcrit, I was fascinated\
  \ to read your piece about Pierre et Clothilde yesterday. It is true, sadly, that\
  \ the duo's career lay in tatters by the early 1970s. What was missing from your\
  \ article, however, was any account of Pierre's later involvement in the punk \u2018\
  n\u2019 post-punk scene. My cousin Sid Punkcrit covered this in an article for the\
  \ monthly magazine Punks Named Pierre in September 1979. I clipped it out with a\
  \ pair of extremely shiny scissors, and am sending it to you so you can transcribe\
  \ it and share it with your readers.\n\nExciting news reaches us that Pierre, previously\
  \ of chart-non-topping duo Pierre et Clothilde, is making a comeback! He has completely\
  \ reinvented himself for the punk \u2018n\u2019 post-punk era, fronting a new band\
  \ called Pierre et les Pantoufles (above; Pierre is on the far left). Their first\
  \ single, O\xF9\_est Clothilde?, a raucous and godawful discordant din, had me tapping\
  \ my toes while wearing my own pantoufles. The B side, Clothilde, Mon Amour is less\
  \ of a toe-tapper and more of a hands-over-the-ears cacophany of cacophonosity.\n\
  The band is currently in the studio recording their debut album, Devons-nous jeter\
  \ cette salet\xE9\_\xE0\_\_nos pop-enfants, Clothilde? It promises to be a cracker.\
  \ That is a view shared by Plastic Bertrand, who I bumped into in a corridor on\
  \ my way to conduct an interview with Pierre. It came as a surprise to me that Plastic\
  \ Bertrand is not, as I thought, made of plastic. This revelation so disconcerted\
  \ me that, when I sat down with Pierre, the first thing I said to him was: \u201C\
  Pierre, did you know that Plastic Bertrand is not made of plastic?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Oui\u201D he muttered, before launching into a mournful lament about Clothilde,\
  \ accompanied by copious weeping. Unfortunately, it was all in French, or the dialect\
  \ of French spoken by Walloons, a language with which I am wholly unfamiliar. So\
  \ I just sat there trying to look sympathetic, while puffing on a Gitane. There\
  \ was no sign of the Pantoufles.\nBy the time Pierre eventually shut up and dried\
  \ his eyes with a dainty and unpunklike silken handkerchief, I had got through an\
  \ entire pack of Gitanes and had heard quite enough mawkish Wallonian blathering.\
  \ I was trying to work out what to do next. I could slap Pierre about and tell him\
  \ to get a grip. Or I could try to divert him on to a different subject. Best of\
  \ all, perhaps, I could sweep imperiously out of the room and pursue Plastic Bertrand.\n\
  Then the door crashed open, and a woman swept imperiously into the room. I thought\
  \ for a moment she was some kind of space hippy. Then I realised\u2014it was Clothilde!\n\
