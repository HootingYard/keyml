text: "I have written previously, on a number of occasions, about bogs, but as far\
  \ as I recall I have not addressed the important topic of bog standards. It is helpful,\
  \ as ever, to define our terms at the outset, so let me cobble together a very basic\
  \ definition of the bog standard.\nBog standard\_: A standard, or flag, assigned\
  \ to a bog, and usually flown from a flagpole anent the bog.\nNow if I know my readers,\
  \ and I think I do, you will be sitting there open-mouthed, perhaps dribbling slightly,\
  \ saying to yourselves something along the lines of \u201CWell, I am utterly befuddled.\
  \ Never in all my life have I ever seen a flag flying next to a bog, unless inadvertently.\
  \ Certainly not where the flag is inextricably bound to the bog, is as it were the\
  \ bog's flag. No, that is wholly outwith my lived experience. And yet Mr Key is\
  \ never wrong, as far as I am aware. His is a still small voice of certainty in\
  \ a baffling world. Blimey. No wonder I am befuddled.\u201D\nYou may mop up your\
  \ dribble and unfuddle your head, for I shall explain all. What I did not mention,\
  \ in my definition, was that the bog standard was confined to a particular time\
  \ and place, and that time has passed and that place is no more. Those of you with\
  \ a smattering of vexillological learning may have an inkling of what I am talking\
  \ about. You might guess that this has something to do with that flag-mad king,\
  \ Gobbo III, of the bog-riddled land of Tantarabim.\nIf you were paying due attention\
  \ to Herr Von Straubenzee's lessons, in the old wooden schoolroom long ago, you\
  \ may recall Gobbo III, his tyrannical reign, his temper tantrums, his odd refulgent\
  \ crown, his bustling and stamping, his surfeit of lampreys, his wax effigy, his\
  \ cardboard queen, his lupin nosegays, his unrestrained power, his ceremonial pincers,\
  \ his butt of Malmesbury, and of course his flags. You may recall these things because,\
  \ if Gobbo III was mad for flags, then Herr Von Straubenzee was mad for Gobbo. He\
  \ rarely taught us about anyone or anything else, long ago in the old wooden schoolroom,\
  \ with frost on the windowpanes and icicles hanging from the ceiling.\nIt was while\
  \ I was spending an hour or two slumped on a municipal park bench, watching swans\
  \ and ducks in a municipal park pond, that my thoughts turned to reverie, and all\
  \ unbidden my mind was filled with Herr Von Straubenzee. The memory of him in turn\
  \ reminded me of Gobbo III, and of his flag-madness, and I remembered something\
  \ we had been told of the time he, the King, decreed that every bog in the land\
  \ should have its own flag. I could only remember vaguely, so on my way home I popped\
  \ in to the Vexillology Club, and got a temporary ticket to use its library, and\
  \ I pored over many many books about flags, and eventually I found what I was looking\
  \ for. I seemed to remember Herr Von Straubenzee telling us that the proclamation,\
  \ or promulgation, of Gobbo III's decree had been recorded, and preserved, and indeed\
  \ it had, for there it was tucked away in the endpapers of one of the books I consulted.\n\
  Bow down, bow down, ye serfs and peasants, and pin back your ears, for I am your\
  \ King and I have a proclamation to proclaim! Let my words crash like thunder in\
  \ your ears! In my majesty and magnificence I hereby decree that every bog in the\
  \ land shall have its own flag. I have a vision, of a stout and mighty flagpole\
  \ planted in the muck anent each bog, and from each flagpole shall fly that bog\
  \ its flag. And let no one, not princeling nor peasant, not noble nor knave, cause\
  \ any one of the flags o\u2019 the bogs ever to be lowered, for any reason whatsoever,\
  \ natural or supernatural, sensible or foolish. Let the vexillographers of the land\
  \ begin work this very day on the designs of said flags, to be submitted for my\
  \ personal approbation. This I decree, for I am mighty and majestic, and I hold\
  \ in my hand the ceremonial pincers. I am Gobbo!\nIt is one of the great sadnesses\
  \ of my life that I never heard these words spoken by Herr Von Straubenzee. While\
  \ it is true that his voice was thin and reedy and he often had to break off from\
  \ speaking to cough up blood into the pail he kept by his lectern, he would have\
  \ done them justice, I think, in the old wooden schoolroom long ago, with frost\
  \ on the windowpanes and icicles hanging from the ceiling, a freezing draught creeping\
  \ in under the door and making the flimsy flames from the blubber candles flicker.\
  \ The flames cast shadows on the walls, and I remember how Frau Von Straubenzee,\
  \ after our lessons, would enchant us with her shadow puppetry, of cows and pigs\
  \ and mythological beasts and noble kinsmen and hydroelectric power stations and\
  \ swans and ducks.\nSpeaking of which, I hid the transcript of Gobbo III's proclamation\
  \ under my fantastically stylish Flinders Petrie cardigan, nipped out of the Vexillology\
  \ Club library via the back staircase, and returned to the municipal park bench,\
  \ by the municipal park pond. The swans and ducks were still splashing about. A\
  \ pond is not a bog, far from it, but as I sat there in the dying light of an autumn\
  \ afternoon, I thought how the scene would be improved by a flagpole and a flag,\
  \ a special flag designed for that pond alone. Now, for the first time I realised\
  \ that Gobbo III, for all his tyrannical reign and his temper tantrums and his odd\
  \ refulgent crown and his bustling and stamping and his surfeit of lampreys and\
  \ his wax effigy and his cardboard queen and his lupin nosegays and his unrestrained\
  \ power and his ceremonial pincers and his butt of Malmesbury, was that rare thing,\
  \ a wise king, perhaps even a philosopher king.\nTo each bog its flag. That simple\
  \ phrase holds a deeper, more profound truth than the mere words can convey. I think\
  \ Herr Von Straubenzee, in the old wooden schoolroom long ago, with frost on the\
  \ windowpanes and icicles hanging from the ceiling, a freezing draught creeping\
  \ in under the door and making the flimsy flames from the blubber candles flicker,\
  \ knew that. And I salute his memory.\n[2012-07-07]"
