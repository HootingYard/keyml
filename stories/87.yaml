text: "Before winning fame\u2014or perhaps notoriety\u2014as the coach of fictional\
  \ athlete Bobnit Tivol, the chain-smoking miseryguts we know and love as Old Halob\
  \ led a purposeless and indigent existence. The familiar image of him, in that raincoat,\
  \ grim and windswept and coughing up catarrh, standing at the side of a running\
  \ track spurring his fictional prot\xE9g\xE9 on to ever greater sprinting triumphs,\
  \ had not yet been beamed through television screens across the globe back in the\
  \ days when only a cluster of hovels stood on the site that would one day become\
  \ the Old Halob Stadium Of Sporting Triumph And Prowess.\nIn his bestselling paperback\
  \ Old Halob And Petula Clark\_: Are They The Same Person?, Pebblehead posits the\
  \ theory that the (possibly) East European coach and the English songstress are\
  \ the same person. He points to the well-documented fact that both, as children,\
  \ sang in the entrance hall of Bentalls Department Store in Kingston-upon-Thames\
  \ in exchange for a tin of toffee and a gold wristwatch. In addition, like Petula\
  \ Clark, Old Halob released a CD entitled L'essentiel\u201420 Succ\xC3\xA8s Inoubliables.\
  \ This is where his argument fails to convince, for where the aged pop diva's album\
  \ contained songs, and was a chart hit in Belgium, Old Halob's CD consisted of a\
  \ recording of him eating his breakfast and grumbling about his moth-eaten raincoat,\
  \ and was an international, rather than merely a local, success.\nPebblehead's twaddle\
  \ is thoroughly demolished, of course, if we consider that for the first fifty two\
  \ years of his life, Old Halob did little except refill bird feeders in the grounds\
  \ of a Home for the Deranged, a job for which he was paid with a daily bowl of gruel\
  \ and slops. His parents were fabulously wealthy, and lived the life of Riley in\
  \ a big forbidding castle, but their son lacked ambition, and they disowned him\
  \ when, at the age of nine, he rejected their birthday gifts of a booster pack,\
  \ the elixir of life, a modelling contract with L'Oreal, and a populated planet\
  \ in a far distant galaxy to treat as his plaything.\nNo one, not even Pebblehead,\
  \ knows what happened to transform the dull-witted bird feeder maintenance man into\
  \ an athletics coach of legend. Perhaps a clue lies in his change of diet. Shortly\
  \ after Old Halob's fiftieth birthday, the management of the Derangement Home was\
  \ restructured following a report from consultants Pricewatergatecoopersfreemanhardywillis.\
  \ As part of their recommendations, Old Halob stopped eating gruel and slops and\
  \ was instead fed on whelks and barnacles. The evidence is not conclusive, but future\
  \ biographers would be stupid to ignore it.\nAnd that is all I have to say about\
  \ Old Halob today.\n[2007-02-28]"
