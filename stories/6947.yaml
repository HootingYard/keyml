text: "Hooting Yard reader Richard Carter has a letter published in the latest edition\
  \ of the\_London Review Of Books. I take the liberty of reproducing it here for\
  \ your edification and instruction. Our resident anagrammatist R. (who is not Richard,\
  \ by the way) should find it of particular interest:\nSteven Shapin writes that\
  \ Darwin's uncontrollable retching and farting seriously limited his public life\
  \ (LRB, 30 June). Some years ago, to my delight, I worked out that the great man's\
  \ full name, Charles Robert Darwin, is an anagram of \u2018rectal winds abhorrer\u2019\
  . Unfortunately for my anagram, the meanings of words, like species, can evolve.\
  \ On the rare occasions that Darwin mentioned his problems to friends, he always\
  \ used the word \u2018flatulence\u2019. Nowadays, we think of flatulence as being\
  \ synonymous with farting, but in Darwin's day it meant (as it technically still\
  \ does) an accumulation of gases in the alimentary canal. While I'm sure that Darwin\
  \ must have vented his excess gas one way or the other, there's no reason to believe\
  \ that his farts were uncontrollable.\n[2011-07-21]"
