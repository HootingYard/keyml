text: "Long, long ago, so long ago that the Malice Aforethought Press was not even\
  \ a twinkle in my eye, I wrote a poem entitled My Plankton Theory. Here it is:\n\
  All my life I'd waited\n    To announce my plankton theory\n    The public laughed\n\
  \    Top scientists jeered\n    When they heard my plankton theory\nWhen I was a\
  \ small boy\n    I swam in ponds and lakes\n    Then I grew up\n    Got diving gear\n\
  \    And I worked out my plankton theory\nNow I'm about to die\n    I won't go skindiving\
  \ again\n    It's in my head\n    On my deathbed\n    But I never, ever tested my\
  \ plankton theory\nAs I remembered, there was another version of this in which I\
  \ had a bauxite theory rather than a plankton theory. That can't be right, because\
  \ the middle verse would make no sense. The flaw in my recollection was confirmed\
  \ when I came upon a big fat book of poems in the same paper-midden as I found the\
  \ old Malice Aforethought Press mail order catalogue. It turned out I was confusing\
  \ My Plankton Theory with a wholly separate piece, a love song entitled 40 Years\
  \ Of Hell In A Bauxite Mine. I shall draw a veil over that one.\nThe point is that\
  \ this book is crammed with over one hundred poems, written I would guess between\
  \ 1980 and 1986, and they are almost uniformly dreadful. I can just about tippy-tap\
  \ out the words of My Plankton Theory without running screaming into the hills to\
  \ throw myself into a tarn, but only just. I find myself thanking the Lord and his\
  \ angels and the hideous bat god Fatso and many another deity that Het Internet\
  \ as we know it did not then exist, for there would have been a very real risk that\
  \ I would have posted my verses for the world to read instead of scribbling them\
  \ in a private notebook. Youth of today, be warned! Think before you commit your\
  \ burblings to the interweb!\nIt is not as if I can excuse the drivel as the product\
  \ of teenage angst, as I was no longer a teenager. I do not understand, looking\
  \ back, why I was writing verse instead of prose. But verse it was, page after page\
  \ of it. It is true that I had a very short-lived career as a performance poet,\
  \ in those heady post-punk days when performance poets were all the rage. When I\
  \ say short-lived, I ought to be clear and explain that I did one gig. This was\
  \ in Norwich, in 1982, where I supported the amusing band Serious Drinking. (The\
  \ amusing thing about them was that they pretended to be oiky proles but were of\
  \ course university graduates, and at least two of them were in receipt of healthy\
  \ trust funds. I suspect genuine oiky proles spotted the imposture without too much\
  \ difficulty.) My approach at the gig was that, after shouting\u2014yes, shouting\u2014\
  each poem (examples, Snackbar Hooligan and Ten Days In a Shed), I scrunched up the\
  \ sheet of paper on which it was hand-scribbled and threw it into the audience.\
  \ I think I was generally well-received, and I am not entirely sure why this remained\
  \ my one and only appearance before I resurfaced on a stage, twenty years later,\
  \ shortly before the dawn of the Hooting Yard you know and adore. I do recall feeling\
  \ a tingle of pleasure when the Norwich gig was announced by John Peel on his radio\
  \ show. I was billed as \u201CFrank Key The Poet\u201D.\nPerhaps, in spite of the\
  \ lack of actual performances, it was the thoroughly wrong-headed idea of myself\
  \ as \u201CThe Poet\u201D that kept me beavering away at verses for the next few\
  \ years. I moved away from Norwich and was no longer in contact with any kind of\
  \ local music scene where I might have been prevailed upon to spout my stuff to\
  \ crowds of adoring fans. The big fat hardback notebook was, then, quite consciously,\
  \ just for me. I am pleased to be able to say that I never badgered family and friends\
  \ with it. Few experiences are as discomfiting as being trapped in a room with someone\
  \ who says \u201CLet me read you a few of my latest poems\u201D, and I had been\
  \ at the listening end of that particular horror often enough never to inflict it\
  \ upon anyone else. But it does make me wonder why on earth I was writing all this\
  \ stuff, and that it was all verse and no prose.\nAs for My Plankton Theory itself,\
  \ the roots of this towering work lie in the late 1970s, when I recall watching\
  \ a television programme\u2014probably Horizon\u2014in which it was confidently\
  \ asserted that \u201Ckrill is the food of the future\u201D. Well, almost forty\
  \ years on, here we are in the future, and I am not eating krill. At least, I don't\
  \ think I am. Maybe I ought to take a closer interest in packaging, and lists of\
  \ ingredients, and modern food production processes. It may be that I am eating\
  \ a lot more krill than I suspect, shredded or pulped and somehow injected into\
  \ my breakfast cereals and snack items and smokers\u2019 poptarts and so forth.\
  \ But I envisaged a more explicit krill-centred diet, chains of fast food restaurants\
  \ called Krill R Us or Kentucky Fried Krill, krill-based delicacies for the gourmet,\
  \ or even that staple of science fiction imaginings, the krill-pill, which I would\
  \ obtain from a Krill-O-Mat before zooming off on my jetpack. Alas, the future has\
  \ not turned out quite as forecast. Thereagain, when I was a little boy I swam in\
  \ municipal swimming pools rather than in ponds and lakes, I have never been skindiving,\
  \ and I never, ever really had a plankton theory.\n[2012-04-22]"
