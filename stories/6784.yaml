text: "I caught this morning morning's minion, with a combination of cunning, inhuman\
  \ patience, and a big net weighted with baffles. I lay in wait from before dawn,\
  \ behind an arras, primed by a flask of vitamin-enhanced Squelcho! from which I\
  \ took regular slurps. Then, as morning broke, as the kingdom of daylight's dauphin\
  \ came prancing into the room carrying a breakfast tray, I pounced, leaping out\
  \ from behind the arras, shouting, and chucking the net over him. He dropped the\
  \ tray, and flailed and screeched, dapple-dawn-drawn, and I bashed him on the bonce\
  \ with a brick and dragged him off to my lair elsewhere in the castle.\nLater in\
  \ the morning my father, the king, ran me to ground in a pantry, my heart in hiding,\
  \ scoffing cake. He was in a filthy temper, because, of course, he had had no breakfast.\
  \ That was why he came barging into the pantry; he was hoping to forage for toothsome\
  \ treats among the leftovers. At sight of me, however, his hunger was suppressed\
  \ by a great eruption of rage.\n\u201CUnworthy princeling!\u201D he roared, \u201C\
  Preening milksop! Rancorous varlet!\u201D\nHe continued with this tirade of insults\
  \ for some time, his kingly boom growing louder and louder, so loud that the tins\
  \ on the pantry shelves began to wobble and clatter.\nWhether it is because of my\
  \ twisted spine, my slobbering, or my pointy little head, my father harbours the\
  \ conviction that I am unfit to succeed him on the throne of his shabby kingdom.\
  \ Blind to my brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, he has been\
  \ plotting to do away with me, enlisting the help of his minions, morning's one\
  \ and afternoon's one and evening's one, Freeman, Hardy and Willis. That he has\
  \ no other heir, nor is likely to spawn one in his ancient dotage, does not seem\
  \ to have occurred to him.\nI, in turn, was plotting against the minions. Having\
  \ nabbed Freeman at first light, I planned to entrap Hardy and Willis by similar\
  \ means in the coming hours. Once I had the three of them safely imprisoned in my\
  \ lair, I could move on to the next stage of the plot, though what that might be\
  \ had not yet formed in my brain, buzzing and pulsating and rather too big for my\
  \ abnormally tiny head.\nFor the time being, I simply stood there, twisted and hunched\
  \ and scoffing cake, as my father heaped imprecations upon me in the pantry, and\
  \ the tins on the shelves clattered and shook until one fell to the floor and as\
  \ it hit the tiles I saw the metal\nBuckle! AND a fire broke from it then, a billion\
  \ times told lovelier, more dangerous than my father's temper. The blaze that broke\
  \ from the buckled tin of compressed reconstituted snacktime meat substitute was\
  \ so surprising it even shut my father up. He stopped shouting and looked at it\
  \ with awe and terror in his eyes.\nThe fire quickly burned down to blue-beak embers.\
  \ I kicked the charred tin across the pantry floor with my club foot and snapped\
  \ my fingers.\n\u201CAh my dear,\u201D I said to papa, \u201CFall, gall yourself,\
  \ and gash gold-vermilion\u201D, and I left the words hanging, and hobbled out of\
  \ the pantry, stuffed with cake, to waylay Hardy, afternoon's minion, as he came\
  \ on duty.\n[2011-06-26]"
