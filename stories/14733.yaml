text: "In a review of a new biography of Thomas De Quincey, Hermione Eyre brilliantly\
  \ describes him as \u201Cbroke, pompous, and high as a kite\u201D. Could the same,\
  \ I wondered, be said of Mr Key? Let us take them in turn.\nBroke. Definitely. I\
  \ have a very limited income, and I lead a very frugal life. I am deeply grateful\
  \ to my subscribers and those who make one-off donations (you know who you are)\
  \ who help to alleviate my penury. I did entertain the fantasy, last year, that\
  \ Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives might become a huge international bestseller\
  \ and thereby bring the wealth of Croesus showering upon me, but of course this\
  \ failed to happen. Writing is not a sensible pursuit if one wants to become rich.\n\
  Pompous. I try my best to burnish my pomposity. Declaiming and pontificating, particularly\
  \ upon subjects I know little or nothing about, is a helpful approach in this regard.\
  \ It is also important not to behave, or even think, as if one is broke (see above).\
  \ In fact, reduced circumstances can make pomposity easier to achieve. Having little\
  \ justification to assume an air of grandeur, my attitude of rising high above the\
  \ riffraff is most surely pompous, and I would have it no other way.\nHigh as a\
  \ kite. This is where I am unable to compare myself to De Quincey. In the last century,\
  \ I could have done. An American editor, considering my early work, wondered if\
  \ I wrote under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. (This is referred to in David\
  \ Langford's 1993 article, here.) While I eschewed illegal drugs, I was pretty much\
  \ perpetually drunk for the last twenty years of the twentieth century, so I suppose\
  \ it is true that all my early writing was done when I was high as a kite, or pissed\
  \ as a newt. Eventually, of course, my debauches left me unable to string a coherent\
  \ sentence together, and I was reduced to bestial grunting on the way to and from\
  \ the off licence.\nI swore off booze in 2001 and haven't touched a drop since then.\
  \ At first I did worry that perhaps clear-headed sobriety would scupper my prose,\
  \ but of course it didn't. Every so often I toy with the idea of writing one of\
  \ those booze-memoirs, but the thing about drunks \_and druggies is that we are\
  \ very, very boring. Unless, like Thomas De Quincey, we are touched by genius.\n\
