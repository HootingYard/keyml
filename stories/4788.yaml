  \ Things Of The Outside World, Last Fire (1861)\_:\n\u201CAmatus Lusitanus relates\
  \ the case of a monk who fainted when he beheld a rose, and never quitted his cell\
  \ while that flower was blooming. Orfila (a less questionable authority) gives the\
  \ account of the painter Vincent, who was seized with violent vertigo, and swooned,\
  \ when there were roses in the room. Voltaire gives the history of an officer who\
  \ was thrown into convulsions and lost his senses by having pinks in his chamber.\
  \ Orfila also relates the instance of a lady, of forty-six years of age, of a hale\
  \ constitution, who could never be present when a decoction of linseed was preparing,\
  \ being troubled in the course of a few minutes with a general swelling of the face,\
  \ followed by fainting and a loss of the intellectual faculties, which symptoms\
  \ continued for four-and-twenty hours. Montaigne remarks on this subject, that there\
  \ were men who dreaded an apple more than a cannon-ball. Zimmerman tells us of a\
  \ lady who could not endure the feeling of silk and satin, and shuddered when she\
  \ touched the velvety skin of a peach\_: other ladies cannot bear the feel of fur.\
  \ Boyle records the case of a man who experienced a natural abhorrence of honey\
  \ ; a young man invariably fainted when a servant swept his room. Hippocrates mentions\
  \ one Nicanor, who swooned whenever he heard a flute ; and Shakespeare has alluded\
  \ to the strange effect of the bagpipe. Boyle fell into a syncope when he heard\
  \ the splashing of water ; Scaliger turned pale on the sight of water-cresses ;\
  \ Erasmus experienced febrile symptoms when smelling fish ; the Duke d'Epernon swooned\
  \ on beholding a leveret, although a hare did not produce the same effect ; Tycho\
  \ Brahe fainted at the sight of a fox, Henry III of France at that of a cat, and\
  \ Marshal D'Albret at a pig. The horror that whole families entertain of cheese\
  \ is well known.\u201D\n[2010-07-17]"
