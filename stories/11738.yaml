text: "For a long time I coveted my neighbour's ox. I knew this was wrong, deeply\
  \ wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. It was a tremendous ox, with a splendid\
  \ pair of horns, a tail that shouted \u201Csoup!\u201D, and great bulky lumbering\
  \ solidity. Its name was Keith. I watched it, through my greasy window pane, as\
  \ it mooched in its oxy way around my neighbour's paddock, and I coveted it.\nI\
  \ think it important to point out that I did not covet my neighbour's house, which\
  \ was in any case an unseemly hovel compared with my chalet. Nor did I covet his\
  \ wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ass, for the simple reason\
  \ that he did not possess any of these. He was a lonely and lowly fellow, crushed\
  \ by penury, and it was something of a miracle that he had managed to get his hands\
  \ on an ox.\nAnd what an ox! The first time I slapped eyes on Keith I was transfixed.\
  \ I rubbed at the window pane with a rag the better to view the magnificent beast.\
  \ After a while I pulled up a chair so I could sit while peering through the pane,\
  \ for I felt my spindly legs giving way due to nervous tension. I used the rag to\
  \ mop my brow, and gazed, covetously, oh covetously, all the livelong day. Every\
  \ now and then, Keith would snort, and I could hear him clearly, for his snorting\
  \ was loud and sonorous, and I felt frissons of pleasure.\nFull many a day sat I\
  \ watching this majestic ox, coveting him, wanting him for my own. As I watched,\
  \ I hatched plot after plot. I would beat my neighbour to death with a spade, and\
  \ with the same spade bury him in the earth, and so claim Keith as mine. Or, I would\
  \ run away with the ox, hauling him along by a halter, heading for the distant hills.\
  \ Or, I would forge documents proving to the unsuspecting eye that I was the ox's\
  \ rightful owner, pursuing my neighbour through the highest courts in the land.\
  \ Or, I would find, somewhere, a lesser ox, an inferior one, and when my neighbour's\
  \ back was turned would substitute it for Keith, and keep Keith with me always.\n\
  It was this latter plot that gave me pause. I realised I had not the first idea\
  \ how to care for an ox. Upon what did one feed them? What oxy appurtenances did\
  \ they require to live in comfort? Would I risk being gored by those horns were\
  \ I inadvertently to vex my coveted Keith?\nThen I began to wonder if my covetousness\
  \ was all it seemed. Was it the ox I coveted, in and of itself, or was it the act\
  \ of coveting something\u2014anything\u2014that rightly belonged to my neighbour?\
  \ Could it be that what I really desired, over and above everything, was to sit\
  \ peering through my greasy window pane, consumed with feelings of envy for the\
  \ lonely lowly penurious wretch next door? And, had it not been his ox, would I\
  \ have coveted whatever beast he kept in his paddock, be it a duck or an ant?\n\
  I was able to give further thought to these matters when the season of mists descended\
  \ upon the land, and nothing was visible from my window, nothing at all save a milky\
  \ grey blur of blankness. The air was so thick and dense that sound did not carry,\
  \ and I could hear no snorts from Keith. I moved my chair away from the window,\
  \ and pulled down the shutters, and I gazed instead at my ceiling, upon which, like\
  \ Dennis Wheatley, I had painted the stars in their heavens.\nCould I covet a star?\
  \ I could. I picked one, fat and sprightly and sparkling, oh sparkling in a way\
  \ no ox, not even Keith, could sparkle. And while I sat and waited out the long\
  \ long months of mist, I hatched plot after plot to yank that star from the sky\
  \ and drag it down to earth, to hold it beside me, burning bright, all mine, my\
  \ coveted star.\n[2013-07-17]"
