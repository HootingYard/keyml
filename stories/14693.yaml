  \ Word reaches me, however, of the intriguing appearance of a supposed watering-hole\
  \ in north London, pictured below. I say \u201Csupposed\u201D because, reportedly,\
  \ nobody has ever been seen either entering or leaving this mysterious establishment.\
  \ My hunch is that it is some kind of portal to Plovdiv. Boffins are probably hard\
  \ at work tweaking the complicated gubbins designed to rend asunder the laws of\
  \ physics so that, on stepping through the door, one is instantly transported\u2014\
  teleported?\u2014to Plovdiv itself.\n\nMany thanks to Max D\xE9charn\xE9\_for the\
