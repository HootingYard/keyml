text: "Recently there has been prattle in certain corners of Interwebshire predicting\
  \ the imminent demise of the blog. It is, we are told, an outmoded form, due to\
  \ be tossed into the dustbin of history, conquered by the implacable might of social\
  \ networking, wittering and twittering. Such a prediction is quite obviously ballocks\
  \ (as Beckett would spell it). The blog will continue to thrive, at least in this\
  \ neck of the woods, for your beloved Mr Key long ago realised that it is absolutely\
  \ the perfect medium for the outpourings of his puny and pea-sized brain. And I\
  \ am of course not the only one whose blatherings could never be constrained by\
  \ arbitrary twitter-lengths and similar barbarities.\nThis by way of preamble to\
  \ news of a brand new blog for which I must take a small measure of responsibility.\
  \ It is not Hooting Yardy in any way, rather the result of protracted cajoling and\
  \ mental thumping on my part. Believing, as I do, that some of us were born to blog,\
  \ I have finally managed to bash some sense into the noggin of a friend, who until\
  \ now has been writing indefatigably but shoving everything into a drawer to moulder\
  \ unread. What on earth is the point of that in the era of Het Internet?\nThus the\
  \ birth of BlackberryJuniper and Sherbet, wherein we are promised \u201Cwaffling\u201D\
  \ about such matters as \u201Cmodern neo-paganism, established religion, food, animals,\
  \ astronomy, history, books, music, pub quizzes, TV, films, philosophy, psychology,\
  \ and my feeble beginner attempts at gardening\u201D. I told you it wasn't Hooting\
  \ Yardy. What it is is an individual voice, babbling away in inimitable fashion,\
  \ and allowing the babble to be read, rather than muffled and hidden and forgotten\
  \ in that dust-choked drawer.\nI commend it to your attention. Start here, lap it\
  \ up, add it to your RSS feed, and don't forget to post your comments.\n[2011-09-01]"
