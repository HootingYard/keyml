text: "Unfortunately, Madame Boubou did not enclose a snapshot of her engulfment by\
  \ ectoplasm with her Message From Beyond. As luck would have it, a trawl through\
  \ the Hooting Yard Archives turned up this picture which enables lucky readers to\
  \ see with their own eyes the amazing phenomenon of ectoplasmic hoo-ha:\n\nAccording\
  \ to The Minnie Harrison Page, what we see here is \u201Cectoplasm emanating from\
  \ the Medium's mouth. Taken in complete darkness using Kodak infra-red plate. Exposure\
  \ by means of powerful \u2018Sashalight\u2019 bulb through \u2018Wratten\u2019 glass\
  \ filter\u2014extremely deep ruby-red colour. The Ectoplasm is emanating from her\
  \ mouth and in this form it is quite transparent, very similar in appearance and\
  \ texture to chiffon.\u201D\nThose of you who think Minnie Harrison is sitting there\
  \ in her 1948 Middlesbrough sitting room with a net curtain stuffed in her mouth\
  \ are sadly deluded and will not get a helping of Madame Boubou's delicious Boiled\
  \ Rhubarb Surprise.\n[2007-05-22]"
