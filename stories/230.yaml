text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I am a huge fan of Hooting Yard and an even\
  \ huger fan of computer and console games. Can you tell me if there are plans afoot\
  \ for a Hooting Yard-based game I will be able to play on my Gameboy, Wii, or what\
  \ have you?\nOh dear, is all I can say. I can only assume that Tim is a teenage\
  \ boy, for only teenage boys ought to be playing computer games. (Teenage girls\
  \ are busy editing the features pages of The Guardian.) That so many adults spend\
  \ their time \u201Cgaming\u201D is clear evidence of the culture of infantilisation\
  \ which we see all around us. I recommend compulsory reading of The Anatomy Of Melancholy\
  \ and enforced contemplation of the paintings of Oskar Kokoschka, as a start.\n\
  Meanwhile, somewhat shamefacedly, I do have to confess that I have granted a licence\
  \ to a Japanese software development company to create a thoroughly enticing game\
  \ based on certain Hooting Yard characters. The working title for the game is Fictional\
  \ Athlete Bobnit Tivol Magnificent Sprinting And Polevaulting Golden \u1E7Aberchallenge.\
  \ As far as I can understand such things, the titular challenge for players is to\
  \ lead a little pixellated fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol avatar through a series\
  \ of increasingly difficult virtual sporting tournaments. As one progresses through\
  \ each level, cantankerous trainer Old Halob is on hand (coughing and spluttering\
  \ on a variety of high tar cigarettes) to offer tips and advice. The further along\
  \ the player goes, of course, the less help is available from Old Halob, and at\
  \ the highest levels he occupies a corner of the screen languishing in what looks\
  \ like a sanatorium.\nThe putative teenage purchaser of the game can choose from\
  \ various options. You can play as fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, or compete against\
  \ him. In this mode, Old Halob acts as a fiendish adversary, given to such tactics\
  \ as poisoning your pre-sprint cornflakes, blinding you with pepper spray, or breaking\
  \ your legs. You can also select different locations for the stadia in which the\
  \ contests take place, including ancient Latvia, the Essex seaside town of Jaywick,\
  \ and the mystic and frankly terrifying Land of Gaar, alive with nightmarish monsters\
  \ and things that creep upon the face of the earth. The only game setting which\
  \ is fixed and unchangeable is the colour scheme, which as you would expect is sepia.\n\
  The developers hope to gain some celebrity endorsements before the game is released,\
  \ and I understand that they have already made tentative approaches to such luminaries\
  \ as Chris de Burhg [sic] and David Blunkett MP. According to marketing strategists,\
  \ a touchy-feely version for the blind is predicted to outsell the sighted edition.\n\
