text: "\nThis week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I revisit my explanation of the true\
  \ meaning of the words ACRONYM and ACROSTIC. There has been a very slight bit of\
  \ rewriting, the sort of thing that, in years to come, when I am long dead and gone,\
  \ may keep scholars occupied, or indeed fighting with one another, as they fret\
  \ and worry and chew their pencils over the difference between the original and\
  \ the revised versions. To lay a trap for those future scholars, let me just note\
  \ here that the Dabbler text includes the word filthy, which is absent from the\
  \ original Hooting Yard text. This might be connected to the recent appearance on\
  \ these pages of the filthy magpie. Or it might not. Of such arcana, pamphlets can\
  \ be written\u2014and will be!\u2014by scribblers with nothing better to do.\n[2014-08-15]"
