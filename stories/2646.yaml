text: "I went to sea in a fishing smack, and I dangled a net over the side, and I\
  \ caught, among minnows and weed, a cod. Then I steered for shore. At the quayside,\
  \ I hurried to my chalet and I slapped the cod on my tabletop and, with great savagery,\
  \ I gutted it with my bare hands, exposing its innards. I took the liver over to\
  \ the draining-board, where I had ready a glass jar into the neck of which I'd stuck\
  \ a funnel. I squeezed and squeezed the liver until my fists ached, until every\
  \ last drop of oil had dripped down the funnel into the jar. Then I threw the funnel\
  \ away and took a big iron spoon, and I poured oil out of the jar onto the spoon\
  \ and inserted the spoon in my mouth and I drank the oil greedily, desperately,\
  \ gurglingly.\nAnd that, my syphilitic friends, is how I preserve my health, and\
  \ why I can gambol \u2018cross the greensward with the zip and vim of a monkey,\
  \ when the fancy takes me.\n[2009-07-19]"
