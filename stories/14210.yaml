text: "The estimable Richard Carter has reviewed Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief\
  \ Lives on Gruts. I commend it for your attention, not least because in its second\
  \ half Mr Carter has wisely adopted Hooting Yard-approved book-reviewing practice.\
  \ The correct approach was first used ten years ago in our review of Dennis Beerpint's\
  \ novel The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo, reproduced below:\n\
  \u201CAn immense mass of clotted nonsense\u201D. That was the verdict of the magazine\
  \ Teachers\u2019 World upon the first publication of Ulysses by James Joyce, and\
  \ I am tempted to say the same about this Beerpint book, and leave it at that. Astonishingly,\
  \ however, this thousand-page tome has already been made a set book for schools,\
  \ colleges, and orphanages throughout the land, which means that your tots, if you\
  \ have any, or you, if you are a tot, will have to become familiar with it. When\
  \ examination time comes round, everyone's knowledge of Dennis Beerpint's fictional\
  \ farrago will be tested to the full. And so, public-spirited as ever, I am going\
  \ to try to save you from wasting your precious time actually reading the damn thing,\
  \ by telling you what you need to know.\nPlot : Tadzio Gobbo is a princeling in\
  \ a fictional Renaissance city state, clearly meant to remind us of the setting\
  \ of a Jacobean drama such as The Courier's Tragedy by Richard Wharfinger. As the\
  \ novel opens, Gobbo is pristine, even, and uncreased. \u201CIf he were a piece\
  \ of cardboard,\u201D writes Beerpint, \u201Che would not be of the corrugated kind.\u201D\
  \ Chapter by chapter we watch as the princeling becomes ever more becrumpled in\
  \ a variety of unspeakably squalid ways, until at the end there is a deus ex machina\
  \ and he is unfolded and ironed out.\nCharacters\_: Tadzio Gobbo is a crude self-portrait\
  \ of the author, sharing his weediness, neurasthenia, predilection for twee verse,\
  \ and hypochondria. Many of his becrumplements are accompanied by the onset of an\
  \ imagined disease, such as yaws, the bindings, ague, flux, black bile, bitter colic\
  \ and the strangury. Beerpint attempts to play up a certain devil-may-care foppishness,\
  \ but this is never convincing. In fact it is laughably inept.\nThere is a host\
  \ of secondary characters, the most important being Lugubrio, the princeling's mad,\
  \ stiletto-wielding uncle. Beerpint is constantly harping on about his \u201Cfrantic\
  \ black eyebrows\u201D, which soon becomes tiresome. Lugubrio's sole motive for\
  \ all his actions, from eating his breakfast to murdering a crippled beggar, is\
  \ revenge, but what or whom he is avenging is never made clear to the reader.\n\
  Other characters in the novel are a mixture of fictional, legendary, and real historical\
  \ figures. Among the latter are Anthony Burgess, Edward G Robinson, Emily Dickinson,\
  \ L Ron Hubbard and Veronica Lake. Beerpint thinks he is being clever by setting\
  \ some of the scenes in a so-called \u2018Scientology tent\u2019 on the banks of\
  \ \u2018Lake Veronica\u2019, but the effect is simply witless, and the reader will\
  \ struggle not to throw the book into the fireplace.\nImagery\_: As a poet, Beerpint\
  \ has been praised for his imagery (although I cannot think why) and The Unspeakably\
  \ Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo is jam-packed with all his old favourites.\
  \ Crows, cows, burnt toast, pencil-cases, weather systems, the blood-spotted handkerchief\
  \ of a tuberculosis patient, chaffinches, hedgerows, the horn of plenty and the\
  \ Garden of Gethsemane, mud, chutes, Mudchute, potato recipes and pastry fillings,\
  \ starlings, pigs, more starlings, more pigs, a nightmarish albino hen and the Munich\
  \ Air Disaster are all evoked at one time or another in imagistic ways, as the princeling\
  \ become ever further becrumpled.\nDoes the book have heft?\_: Yes it does.\nStructure\
  \ : The book is divided into forty nine chapters, fairly uniform in length. Each\
  \ chapter ends with a reminder, as if the reader needed one, that a further stage\
  \ of unspeakably squalid becrumplement has taken place, except for the last chapter,\
  \ to which I have already referred. Beerpint is clearly fond of the practice found\
  \ in the picaresque novel of summarising the plot in his chapter headings. To take\
  \ a random example, Chapter XXVI is titled: \u201CIn which the becrumpling of Tadzio\
  \ Gobbo proceeds apace, as his mad uncle Lugubrio unleashes a swarm of killer bees\
  \ into the sports arena during a wrestling contest, and a false eclipse of the sun\
  \ leads to rioting and flux; together with some notes on the flocking of chaffinches\
  \ and the nesting habits of starlings, an aside in which a missing punctuation mark\
  \ spells doom for an apothecary, and the reappearance of Lugubrio's lobster.\u201D\
  \nPlagiarism or quotations\_: Certain passages in the book appear to have been copied\
  \ verbatim from novels by Barbara Taylor Bradford, Elias Canetti, Dan Brown, and\
  \ the sociopathic ex-jailbird Jeffrey Archer. Dennis Beerpint presumably considers\
  \ this to be postmodernist irony, a dangerous medical condition best treated by\
  \ having one's brain sluiced out with a violent purgative.\nNarrative sloppiness\_\
  : Untold oodles of it. It is a sloppy, flabby and slapdash book from first to last.\
  \ At its core is a burning jewel of flummery and poppycock.\nBrow\_: Neither high,\
  \ middle, nor low. Not even no-brow. This book's brow is frantic and black (see\
  \ above).\nBookcase location\_: Finding the right spot for this volume on your bookcase\
  \ or bookshelf is likely to be fraught with difficulty. Dobson's invaluable pamphlet\
  \ on the shelving of books, which is sadly out of print, will not help you, even\
  \ if you manage to track down a copy, for as the titanic pamphleteer readily admits,\
  \ \u201CThere are certain books, especially those written by twee poets such as\
  \ Dennis Beerpint, which resist proper shelving on even the most well-ordered of\
  \ bookcases. Top left corner? No. Squeezed in among the drivel and tat on the bottom\
  \ shelf? Hardly. Shoved behind the collected works of Edward Upward and quietly\
  \ forgotten? Certainly not, because you will always remember that it is there, and\
  \ its hidden presence will reproach you every time you go anywhere near the bookcase,\
  \ and you will be as the lowest worm or beetle or that which creepeth on its belly\
  \ in the foulest muck of the earth.\u201D Maddeningly, Dobson goes no further, he\
  \ leaves us in the lurch, he refuses to say what I think he means\u2014set fire\
  \ to the damn thing in your garden, just as Burgess biographer Roger Lewis was tempted\
  \ to do with a rival Life of the absurd Mancunian polymath.\nMarketing ploy : Each\
  \ copy of The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo comes with a free\
  \ gift, viz. a paper bag of badger food. For that reason alone, I recommend that\
  \ you buy a copy at once.\n[2015-11-19]"
