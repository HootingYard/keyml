text: "\u201CThe word \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 was not known to the Victorians, and after\
  \ it was coined by the French spiritualist Charles Richet it vied in favour with\
  \ \u2018teleplasm\u2019 and \u2018ideoplasm\u2019. Richet had thought up the term\
  \ after a seance in 1903.\n\u201CThere are many descriptions in spiritualist literature\
  \ of a misty vapour issuing from a medium which sometimes solidifies. When the medium\
  \ Slade was in Australia in 1878 he produced a cloud-like whitish-grey vapour, \u2018\
  Dr\u2019 Monck produced a white patch that turned into a cloudy pillar, and D D\
  \ Home managed to extrude a variety of clouds that formed into hands. In 1885, Eglinton\
  \ managed a dingy white-looking substance that swayed and throbbed. Madame d'Esperance,\
  \ an almost forgotten medium born in 1849 and noted for her looks rather than her\
  \ phenomena, described the production of ectoplasm as though fine threads were being\
  \ drawn out of the pores of her skin and woven about her face and hands like a spider's\
  \ web. The \u2018red, sticky matter\u2019 described by Bournemouth medium, Vincent\
  \ Turvey, was an unusual variation on the theme, and when Florence Cook was manifesting\
  \ Katie King the latter \u2018was connected with the medium by cloudy, faintly luminous\
  \ threads\u2019.\n\u201CEctoplasm is supposed to have exuded from any or all of\
  \ the medium's orifices, and to have been responsive to light, when it would retract.\
  \ \u2018Ectoplasm\u2019 was captured by an investigator early in this [i.e., the\
  \ twentieth] century; it burned to an ash, leaving a smell as of horn. Chemical\
  \ analysis revealed the presence of salt and phosphate of calcium. It is perhaps\
  \ unfortunate that modern chemists have not had the opportunity to try their skills\
  \ on this mysterious substance.\u201D\nRonald Pearsall, The Table-Rappers (1972)\n\
  Sometimes, ectoplasm could appear inexplicably like a piece of net curtain, as in\
  \ this 1948 photograph of the Middlesbrough medium Minnie Harrison:\n\n[2010-04-02]"
