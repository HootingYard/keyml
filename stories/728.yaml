text: "Yesterday, as I was bumbling about town, I was waylaid by a wild-eyed chap\
  \ who dragged me down an alleyway, trapped me between some bins and a wall, and\
  \ demanded of me that I answer his question.\n\u201CAnd what might your question\
  \ be?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CWell,\u201D he replied, in a shaky and somewhat unhinged\
  \ voice, \u201CIn the midst of the crunch de la credit and the Armageddon brought\
  \ on by the collapse of the global banking system, is there anything\u2014anything\
  \ at all\u2014we can grasp at, as at a straw, from the out of print outpourings\
  \ of the pamphleteer Dobson?\u201D\nNow this was not an unreasonable question, and\
  \ it is one I had been steeling myself to answer at some point, as each day brings\
  \ news of further ruination and collapse, particularly in Iceland, the least populous\
  \ and second smallest of the Nordic countries, a volcanically and geologically active\
  \ island on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Many fjords punctuate its extensive coastline,\
  \ and there are many geysers. Its native beasts include the\_Icelandic sheep,\_\
  Icelandic cattle,\_Icelandic chicken,\_Icelandic goat\_and the sturdy\_Icelandic\
  \ horse. Polar bears\_occasionally visit the island, travelling on icebergs from\
  \ Greenland. Birds, especially sea birds, are a very important part of Iceland\u2018\
  s animal life.\_Puffins,\_skuas, and\_kittiwakes\_nest on its sea cliffs. Yet in\
  \ spite of such interesting features, nothing, it seems, can stop the destruction\
  \ of Iceland's banking system.\nI managed to persuade my wild-eyed assailant to\
  \ unhand me, and suggested that we could talk more productively away from the noisome\
  \ pong of the bins. He agreed, and we decamped to a churchyard rife with sycamore\
  \ and larch and laburnum, in the shade of which we leaned against a couple of tombstones,\
  \ each to his own tombstone, and I was about to begin my reply when my waylayer\
  \ declared that he had a great thirst upon him and that he intended to scamper hotfoot\
  \ to a nearby grocer's to obtain refreshments. He would, he said, be back in a jiffy,\
  \ and off he went.\nI was pleased to be given an interval in which to collect my\
  \ thoughts. I had been ransacking my brain for nuggets, indeed for jewels, to scatter\
  \ into the plainer mulch of my reply. We can use all sorts of metaphors to help\
  \ us picture the mind, and I am fond of the one that fancies it as an attic crammed\
  \ with packing cases and trunks and cardboard boxes. We haul ourselves up a ladder\
  \ into the attic and pick our way by torchlight among the crates, opening this one\
  \ and that as we go, and sometimes we find what we are searching for and sometimes\
  \ we hit upon the unexpected. Blather blather. I have, as you know, an extensive\
  \ knowledge of Dobson and his works, but in order to answer the question I had been\
  \ asked I would have to prise open some of the most securely nailed-down packing\
  \ cases of all, in the furthest corners of my cerebral attic. I had a vague memory\
  \ that the pamphleteer had had much to say about the German Dax, and if I could\
  \ recall where he said it and in what context I felt sure it would lead me to remember,\
  \ with blinding clarity, all sorts of other Dobsonisms regarding not just the Teutonic\
  \ stock market but other stock markets, and by extension other financial gubbins,\
  \ no doubt including the banking system, and then I would have a thorough and sparklingly\
  \ intelligent response to declaim unto my alleyway abductor. Dax, Dax, Dax\u2026\
  \ I kept repeating the word in my head, hoping to stumble upon the mental cardboard\
  \ box I sought, but before I did so my waylayer returned, armed with a couple of\
  \ cartons of Squelcho!, one of which he tossed to me in a casual, loose-limbed fashion,\
  \ as if we had been friends from childhood. I thanked him.\n\u201CThink nothing\
  \ of it,\u201D he replied, \u201CThe cost of a carton of Squelcho! is a small price\
  \ to pay for what you are about to tell me. As the value of stocks plummets around\
  \ the world, a man can have no surer guide than Dobson. Given your encyclopaedic\
  \ knowledge of that titanic pamphleteer, those of us who have only a glancing acquaintance\
  \ with him can come to you and be given the balm and succour we so desperately need.\
  \ So you need not thank me for a mere carton of Squelcho! In fact I have a mind\
  \ to fetch you something to eat as well as to drink. Wait here while I get you some\
  \ crinkle-cut oven chips in a cardboard cone!\u201D\nAnd off he went again. I redoubled\
  \ my fuming mental activity, which I am afraid consisted of simply repeating \u201C\
  Dax, Dax, Dax\u201D over and over again. This time I said it aloud, and became aware\
  \ of a rustling in a clump of graveyard shrubbery. \u201CDax, Dax, Dax\u201D I babbled,\
  \ and out of the foliage bounded an enormous hound. I think it was a mastiff. Whatever\
  \ it was, it sprang at me and sank its gleaming fangs into my cravat. It was going\
  \ for the flesh of my neck, of course, but I wear densely woven cravats designed\
  \ by the cravattist Elspeth Banshee, and even the most savage of pooches would have\
  \ trouble getting its fangs clean through one of her creations. The weight of the\
  \ dog knocked me over, however, and as I fell I banged my head on the tombstone\
  \ upon which I was leaning. Before I lost consciousness, I was aware of a dreadlocked\
  \ scapegrace emerging from the shrubbery in pursuit of the mutt. I remember thinking\
  \ that the laws of nature demand that lanky stringy-bearded white Rastas keep their\
  \ dogs on the ends of lengths of string, and that I had thus been felled by an anomaly.\n\
  I came to thinking I was covered in blood, but it was just the spillage from my\
  \ carton of Squelcho! To one side of me stood the indigent with his unleashed hound,\
  \ to the other my earlier assailant clutching a cardboard cone of crinkle-cut oven\
  \ chips. I sat up.\n\u201CLet me get this straight,\u201D I said. Turning to the\
  \ bedraggled wretch, I asked him to confirm that his dog was called Dax and that\
  \ this had occasioned its flying leap at me. He nodded. \u201CAnd you,\u201D I said,\
  \ turning to the other, \u201CHave brought me a cardboard cone of oven chips which\
  \ have yet to see the innards of an oven and thus remain frozen and will doubtless\
  \ take quite some time to thaw out in the crisp autumn chill of this October morning.\
  \ Correct?\u201D And he nodded too.\nSometimes I wonder why it is that as I wander\
  \ this fair city the only people I come into contact with are the feckless and the\
  \ desperate and the seedy and the sick and the stupid. I rubbed the back of my head\
  \ where it had taken a tombstone clonk, pulled my Elspeth Banshee cravat into a\
  \ particularly fetching cravatoisement around my neck, stood up, plopped my drained\
  \ Squelcho! carton into a municipal waste bin, and strode away out of the churchyard,\
  \ whistling magnificently, witnessing civilisation crashing around me, and as happy\
  \ as a pig in a mudbath.\n[2008-10-10]"
