text: "It pains me to say it, but a few readers are claiming that the Cow & Pins is\
  \ a fictional tavern, a tavern simply made up by Mr Key for his own amusement. A\
  \ \u201CFacebook group\u201D, whatever that might be, has been set up, called The\
  \ Cow & Pins Is A Fictional Tavern, A Tavern Simply Made Up By Mr Key (Of The Hooting\
  \ Yard) For His Own Amusement, which, at the last count, had somewhere between three\
  \ and thirty-five thousand six hundred and forty-six members. One can tell that\
  \ the originators of this calumny are not true devotees, because they have made\
  \ the elementary mistake of referring to \u201CThe Hooting Yard\u201D, when of course\
  \ it never attracts the definite article, never has and never will, so long as there\
  \ is calcium in Mr Key's bones.\nAnyway, to prove these accusers wrong once and\
  \ for all, here is a hyperrealist photograph of the Cow & Pins inn sign, taken by\
  \ Rex Hyper, the noted hyperrealist.\n\n[2009-01-25]"
