text: "Our series on the origins of common phrases continues with a look at \u201C\
  to blodly go . . \u201C.\nWhat do we mean when we say \u201Cto blodly go . . .\u201D\
  ? It is superficially similar to \u201Cto boldly go\u201D, a phrase commonly used\
  \ when describing the forward motion of the USS Enterprise, a spaceship on a five-year\
  \ mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations,\
  \ far in the future and, I have to tell you, wholly fictional in nature. By contrast,\
  \ \u201Cto blodly go\u201D is a way of describing the forward motion of one whose\
  \ progress is accompanied by a soundtrack of tunes by the beat group Blodwyn Pig.\n\
  Unlike boldly going, there are various circumstances in which one may be blodly\
  \ going, and these can be both fictional and non-fictional, that is, real, dammit,\
  \ as real as the large stone kicked by Dr Johnson in order to refute Bishop Berkeley.\
  \ But to consider fictional blodly going first, we might imagine a cinematheque\
  \ film or television programme in which a character is seen in forward motion, from\
  \ point A to point B, while on the soundtrack we hear, say, \u201CThe Modern Alchemist\u201D\
  \ or \u201CBackwash\u201D from Blodwyn Pig's debut album Ahead Rings Out (1969).\n\
  In terms of all-too-real blodly going, this would be seen when a person is lolloping\
  \ along the street with, inserted into their lugholes, the pods attached to a digital\
  \ musical reproduction device such as an mp3 player. Unless they have the volume\
  \ turned up to a barbarous pitch, we would not necessarily know they were listening\
  \ to, for example, \u201CThe Squirrelling Must Go On\u201D from Blodwyn Pig's second\
  \ album Getting To This (1970). We may therefore not know blodly going when we see\
  \ it.\nSimilarly, a person may be driving a car or coach and be listening to a Blodwyn\
  \ Pig recording on their on-board sound system. If the volume is not too loud, and\
  \ they whizz past us as we stand at a bus stop awaiting hopelessly the 666, then\
  \ we will be all unawares that such whizzing is blodly. But it is, it is.\nOne of\
  \ the main differences between boldly going and blodly going is, of course, that\
  \ in the former case Captain Kirk and his crew are zipping across galaxies with\
  \ an attitude of boldness. These people are not shrinking violets who would hardly\
  \ dare say \u201CBoo!\u201D to a goose, or indeed a space-goose. Wherever they go,\
  \ at whatever warp factor, they go there boldly. But with blodly going, the goer\
  \ has much more latitude. Going blodly might mean creeping, gadding, prancing, zooming,\
  \ limping, skulking, zipping, careering, stalking, plodding, staggering or any number\
  \ of other forms of locomotion. The blodliness of the act lies in the accompanying\
  \ soundtrack.\nWas this article helpful? Choose the statement below which best describes\

  \ I have no idea what you are talking about\n\u25A0 I have always been a great fan\
  \ of Blodwyn Pig and think the best move Mick Abrahams ever made was to leave Jethro\
  \ Tull\n\u25A0 I am Ian Anderson, and I stand on one leg to play my flute. What\
  \ can Mick Abrahams do to compare with that, eh?\n[2013-06-03]"
