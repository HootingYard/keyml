text: "\u201CClicking the link would have been a letdown\u201D noted Glyn Webster\
  \ in the email to which he attached this screenshot:\n\nHe may be right, and life\
  \ is too short to follow up every damned link thrown at us by Google. But I confess\
  \ I am very intrigued. In a world of fluffyheads, pseudoscientists, conspiracy theorists,\
  \ theocratic nutters and whatnot, who would have thought that the greatest and most\
  \ dangerous enemy of Reason is poultry? This calls for proper investigation, before\
  \ the majestic achievements of the Enlightenment are brought crashing to the ground\
  \ by vengeful and unreasonable hens. Fear not\u2014Mr Key is on the case!\nI suppose\
  \ one can take a crumb of comfort from the doubt implicit in the question mark appended\
  \ to the caption. Nevertheless, until I am able to bring you further revelations,\
  \ keep a beady eye on any poultry you come across. Meanwhile, I shall begin by looking\
  \ up what Diderot had to say about hens, to discover if he had any inklings of the\
  \ threat.\nUPDATE\_: Hmm, this could prove significant. In D'Alembert's Dream (1769),\
  \ Diderot has Bordeu say this\_: \u201CBut here's a strange fact which countless\
  \ educated people will tell you is true but which is false, namely, that in the\
  \ poultry yard of the archduke they've seen a disgusting rabbit who used to act\
  \ as a cock and service around twenty shameless hens who were happy with the arrangement.\
  \ The people will add that they have been shown some chickens covered with fur which\
  \ were the products of this bestiality. You can be sure they were ridiculed.\u201D\
  \nClearly my next step must be to conduct a rigorous survey of the poultry yards\
  \ of archdukes.\n[2010-06-15]"
