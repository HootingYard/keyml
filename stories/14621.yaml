text: "John Hargrave, founder of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, wrote an article in\
  \ 1925 entitled \u201CA Short Exposition of the Philosophical Basis of the Kibbo\
  \ Kift\u201D. It includes a passage where Hargrave insists on the \u201Cunity of\
  \ the unique units of the Universe\u201D:\nteapots, chairs, mud, electric light\
  \ bulbs, fingernails, hammers, steam engines, mountains, hats, shoes, needles, tram\
  \ tickets, lilies, telephones, tents, dynamos, walking sticks, cow dung, churches,\
  \ iron foundries, neckties, cats, human beings, steel plates, bricks and mortar,\
  \ glass, sealing-wax, trees, thoughts, tables, music, flowers and flower-pots, clouds,\
  \ gutter-gratings, books, food, buttons, machine guns, beads, rain, clocks, boots,\
  \ ferro-concrete, eggs, sunlight, coal, stars, solar systems, slugs, pictures, maggots,\
  \ wheel bolts, smells, darkness and light, collar-studs, speech, seeds, birds, bootlaces,\
  \ insects, skeletons, pepper-corns, babies, Space, Time, Matter, all religions,\
  \ all Spirits, all Matter(s) \u2026 all, all, are actually the ONE GREAT POWER.\n\
  This is quoted in Annebella Pollen's book The Kindred Of The Kibbo Kift, which you\
  \ will recall I recommended during the run of the 2015 Hooting Yard Advent Calendar.\
  \ If you need any further persuasion to obtain a copy, please note that it has recently\
  \ been acclaimed as \u201Cthe most beautiful book in Switzerland\u201D.\n[2016-03-01]"
