text: "\u201CThe haddock\u2026 amongst marine animals, is supposed, throughout maritime\
  \ Europe, to be a privileged fish\_: even in austere Scotland every child can point\
  \ out the impression of St Peter's thumb, by which, from age to age, it is distinguished\
  \ from fishes having, otherwise, an external resemblance. All domesticated cattle,\
  \ having the benefit of man's guardianship and care, are believed, throughout England\
  \ and Germany, to go down upon their knees at one particular moment on Christmas\
  \ Eve, when the fields are covered in darkness, when no eye looks down but that\
  \ of God, and when the exact anniversary hour revolves of the angelic song, once\
  \ rolling over the fields and flocks of Palestine.\u201D\nHargrave Jennings, Curious\
  \ Things Of The Outside World, Last Fire (1861)\n[2010-07-17]"
