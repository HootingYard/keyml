text: "\nWe travelled to Hoon by hot air balloon. I took my harpoon, and impaled a\
  \ wolf that was roaming the woodland below us. We hauled the wolf into the basket\
  \ of our balloon, by a long and sturdy rope that was tied to the end of the harpoon.\
  \ We arrived in Hoon, two balloonists and an impaled wolf, making a bumpy landing.\
  \ The Hoon Head Honcho of Hunted Wolves was there to greet us. \u201CI will have\
  \ that wolf,\u201D he said, \u201CIt is not yours to keep. Here in Hoon we keep\
  \ all hunted wolves, including those that have been impaled by a harpoon shot from\
  \ a hot air balloon.\u201D But we wanted to keep our harpooned wolf, as a rug for\
  \ the basket of our balloon, so I pulled the harpoon out of the wolf and pointed\
  \ it at the man from Hoon. \u201CWe shall keep our wolf. If you try to take it you\
  \ will feel the point of this harpoon upon your neck,\u201D I said. We did not know\
  \ that the man from Hoon was a Wolfman. His head changed shape, and then the rest\
  \ of him, and with his savage claws he tore the silken fabric of our balloon. We\
  \ were trapped in Hoon, helpless among the Wolfmen.\nSource\_: Victorian Tales Of\
