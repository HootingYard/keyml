  This week in The Dabbler I confess to my teenage crush on Harold Wilson. Required
  reading, I think, for anyone interested in pipe-smoking premiers, political paranoia,
  spiders, and bedridden teenagers who have lost the use of their lower limbs.

  For younger readers, here is a photograph of Harold Wilson. On no account should
  you confuse this with December''s daily advent calendar picture. While there is
  always the possibility that Wilson may appear on your calendar at some point, that
  day has not yet come.
