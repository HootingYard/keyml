text: "The little dry leaves are blowing against the windows of a house near the sea,\
  \ with a sound like the whispering of small pale ghosts; they are blowing along\
  \ the parade, over the edge of the century, they are floating away and away into\
  \ the far-off plantations where the country gentlemen are rooted in the mould.\n\
  Here they come, these small ghosts left over, drifting over, from the eighteenth\
  \ century\u2014dry ghosts like the Beau and Beelzebub or Wicked Shifts, Bogey and\
  \ Calibre, Gooserump and King Jog, Mouldy and Madagascar and Snipe, and Mr Creevey\
  \ himself brushing those leaves together with his old hands. Soon there will be\
  \ no leaves left.\nOn the 22nd day of January in the year 1820, whilst the threadbare-looking\
  \ sea beat thinly upon the shore, a man of fifty-two years of age, his once robust\
  \ and reddish face now yellow, his thin dyed black hair, that had once been shining\
  \ and carefully brushed (where any remained), now dull with sweat, and with the\
  \ grey showing through the black and with the skull showing through the hair, lay\
  \ dying upon a hired bed in Sidmouth.\nThe magnificent opening paragraphs of chapter\
  \ one (\u201CThe Death Of The Duke Of Kent\u201D) of Edith Sitwell's 1936 biography\
  \ Victoria Of England. They don't write 'em like that anymore.\n\n[2013-08-29]"
