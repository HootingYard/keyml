text: "Here is the score of Cornelius Cardew's 1971 piece 10,000 Nails In The Coffin\
  \ Of Imperialism. (Click on the image for a slightly larger view.) Note particularly\
  \ that \u201Cyeah!\u201D at the end.\n\nCardew submitted the piece for publication\
  \ in the magazine Aspen, but it was rejected by the editor, American composer Tom\
  \ Johnson, for being \u201Cjust too out of keeping with the issue as a whole\u201D\
  . How different the world might be, forty years later, if the piece had been published!\
  \ All over the world, proletarians would have pored over the latest issue of Aspen\
  \ in their millions, seized on the revolutionary implications of Cardew's score,\
  \ and begun the inevitable historical process of driving those ten thousand nails\
  \ into the coffin of imperialism, thus ushering in a bright new Maoist Utopia of\
  \ political re-education camps and mass famine, where \u201Cworkers would machine-gun\
  \ bosses into bloody pits\u201D, in the words of a poem in praise of Cardew's political\
  \ mentor Hardial Bains. Er\u2026 yeah!\n[2011-07-03]"
