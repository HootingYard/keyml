  On the morning of the second Tuesday in July, as Lars Talc was passing along the
  Avenue Ack on his way to the scientifico-medical club, a mighty thunderstorm was
  blasting the heavens, booming in gong-sounds. The lightning was very slender and
  nimble, and as if playing very near. Flashes lacing two clouds above or a cloud
  and the earth started upon the eyes in live veins of rincing or riddling liquid
  white, inched and jagged as if it were the shivering of a bright riband string which
  had once been kept bound round a blade and danced back into its pleating. Several
  strong thrills of light followed each flash but a grey smother of Finnish darkness
  blotted the eyes if they had seen the fork, and dull furry thickened scapes of it
  were left in them.

  At fourteen minutes past nine, high above Talc, a cloud charged with positive electricity
  unleashed a bolt of lightning towards the negatively-charged earth upon which he
  trod. The lightning flew from side to side, forking through the thinnest air, and
  sought, near the ground, a splendid conductor, which it found in a wee sliver of
  tungsten, or wolfram, embedded by Bewg in the bony core of the talismanic horn which
  Talc carried in the breast pocket of his dashing blazer. From there, the lightning
  bolt zipped across Talc''s chest, through one of his metal buttons, down to the
  buckle of his belt, shot through his right leg, ankle, and foot, and crashed into
  the waiting earth.

  Moments later, Talc, too, toppled to the ground. His eyes were bulging, his brain
  was a fuzzing jelly, his limbs were at once numbed yet quivering, twitching, spastic.
  Burned striae on his flesh sizzled hotly. His gaze fixed upon the Finnish heavens,
  he thought of musketry, tickets, bunny rabbits, a well, fjords, ig, Minnie, ping
  pong, Bewg, the horn, Marseilles, his songbook, Chodd, angels, adjutants, penk,
  a motorboat, dappled things, dim things, destruction, defiance, dolour, dust, and
  death.

  He expired at fourteen and a half minutes past nine in the morning, on the second
  Tuesday in July, struck by lightning on the Avenue Ack, on his way to a scientifico-medical
  club he had joined by dint of intrigue.
