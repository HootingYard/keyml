  \ Yard:\nBASHFUL COCTLOSH TRAUMA SURGEON\nBeing the title of a novel by Maisie Pew,\
  \ due to be published in September. It is a book of ten chapters, their titles being:\n\
  I. The Gelignite Zombie Person From Didcot\nII. Pudding Time\nIII. Paste, Then Gruel\n\
  IV. Our Hero, Dr Slab, Goes Haywire\nV. Being A Chapter In Which Lovecraftian Shudders\
  \ Are Experienced By A Barnyard Person And A Ferocious Bat-Being\nVI. Tord Grip\n\
  VII. The Other Gelignite Zombie Person From Didcot\nVIII. That Sinuous L'Oreal Toss\
  \ Of The Hair Performed By A Pirate Gang\nIX. Shoes? Boots? String?\nXII. Mild Peril\
  \ Fop Dilemma\nLong-term readers, and those with their wits about them, will know\
  \ that, contrary to my claim, no such book was ever published. This is because (a)\
  \ I made it up, and (b) \u201CMaisie Pew\u201D did not then, and does not now, exist.\
  \ I made her up too. Of course, I could have written Bashful Coctlosh Trauma Surgeon\
  \ myself, and I may even have planned to, but I never did. I still could. I rather\
  \ fancy it would be a pulpy potboiler. If I followed the practice of certain eminent\
  \ pulp writers, I might be able to bash it out in a week or so. The thing to do\
  \ would be to start typing and not fret too much about felicities of style and wotnot.\n\
  Incidentally, for those who care about such matters, \u201CCoctlosh\u201D was a\
  \ sort of proto-Hooting Yard, or proto-Pointy Town. It was a fictional location\
  \ which was the setting for a few stories I wrote as long ago as the late 1970s,\
  \ each of which featured Josef Bong. Mr Bong was stolen from The Good Soldier \u0160\
  vejk by Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek, where he is mentioned, just once, in passing, in\u2014\
  I recall\u2014a newspaper cutting, where he is described as a \u201CBrave Driver\u201D\
  \ (of a train). My Josef Bong rode a horse, mounted upon which he arrived in Coctlosh\
  \ in the first of the stories, on a blistering hot day. I do not remember much else\
  \ about these ancient texts, which are\u2014alas\u2014lost. Burned, I think, in\
  \ a frenzy, long ago.\n[2014-05-14]"
