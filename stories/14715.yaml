text: "Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree. Now, take a step back and consider\
  \ your handiwork. Did you tie the knot with due care, so that it will not come loose\
  \ and the yellow ribbon be borne away in the howling gale which, if we are to believe\
  \ Tim the radio meteorologist, is imminent? You had best check that knot again.\
  \ And did you ensure that the ribbon you used was as yellow as yellow could be?\
  \ The painter Pierre Bonnard once remarked \u201CYellow! One can't get enough of\
  \ it!\u201D and there spoke a man who knew what he was talking about. So while you\
  \ stand there, feeling the first faint stirrings of the coming gale, ask yourself\
  \ if Bonnard would give your ribbon the thumbs up. If you can honestly say \u201C\
  Yes!\u201D, and you are convinced your knot is secure, then you may give yourself\
  \ a pat on the back and repair to Old Ma Purgative's Tea Shop for a well-earned\
  \ snack.\nBut soft! Who cometh? Who is this, mincing along the lane towards the\
  \ old oak tree, armed with a gleaming pair of scissors? Why, it is Mr Snippy! He\
  \ has designs on your yellow ribbon. If he is not stopped, he will snip snip snip\
  \ with his scissors and stuff the ribbon into his pocket and scurry away, cackling,\
  \ looking for other ribbons to snip, from other trees.\nPick up that spade and bash\
  \ Mr Snippy with it. While he is lying on the ground groaning and gurgling, snatch\
  \ up the scissors and toss them into the mire beyond the old oak tree, having first\
  \ embluntened them with an embluntening tool. Then give Mr Snippy a few kicks for\
  \ good measure and sashay off towards the Tea Shop. The wind is coming in, and you\
  \ will want to be indoors, safe and snug, so you can write up your report to the\
  \ Old Oak Tree Yellow Ribbon Board of Supervisors. They do not suffer fools gladly.\n\
