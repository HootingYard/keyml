text: 'At last, a modicum of sense from the pubescent noodleheads who run the television
  schedules. I wonder if their ranks have been infiltrated by a Dobsonist? Apparently,
  there is a forthcoming series called Strictly Pamphleteering, in which contestants
  will write pamphlets and declaim them on live television. Week by week, the panel
  of judges and the public will vote out the most hopeless would-be pamphleteer, until
  at the end of the series, the winner is crowned Strictly Pamphleteering Pamphleteer
  Of The Year.

  No details have yet emerged of who will be on the judging panel, though names such
  as Dale Winton, Yoko Ono, V S Naipaul and Leo Sayer have been touted. The panel
  will also decide on each week''s pamphlet topic, with subjects ranging from ospreys
  to goat husbandry to the astronomical innovations of Tycho Brahe. We can be sure
  that the eventual winner will have shown a splendid ability to declaim mighty pamphleteering
  prose about pretty much anything under the sun. Could this show bring us a 21st
  century Dobson? I live in hope.
