text: "Dear Frank, writes Tim Thurn, who has taken to calling himself Tim Thurn Of\
  \ That Ilk, I assume in a desperate attempt to lend himself some gravitas, I was\
  \ intrigued to read in your account of the Old Farmer Frack Memorial Essay Contest\
  \ that the judges would include Wilf Self, Wilf Amis, and Wilfette Winterson. I\
  \ have never heard of any of these people, despite being incredibly well-informed\
  \ in all manner of subjects. Indeed, so huge is the amount of information stored\
  \ within my brainpans that I have been compared, by idiots, to Stephen Fry, and\
  \ by people with a modicum of sense to Roger Bacon (c.1219\u20131294), \u201CDoctor\
  \ Mirabilis\u201D, the man who, it was claimed, had read everything.\nNot wishing\
  \ to doubt your word, I ran the names past my uncle, whose name also happens to\
  \ be Wilf. He looked at me witheringly and, with barely a pause, accused you of\
  \ having invented your Wilfs, and Wilfette, out of whole cloth. \u201CThese people\
  \ do not exist,\u201D were his exact words, and I believe him, for he has made a\
  \ point, during his long life, of keeping tabs on all the Wilfs and Wilfettes who\
  \ have ever existed. Some may think it a foolish hobby, and it probably is, but\
  \ that's my Uncle Wilf for you.\nAnyway, his pronouncement set me thinking. Why,\
  \ I asked myself, would Key go to the trouble of making up a couple of Wilfs and\
  \ a Wilfette when he must have known that he would be exposed as a fraudster and\
  \ scoundrel as soon as anyone took the trouble to check? I must admit that for quite\
  \ some time I was stumped. I just sat there, chewing the end of a pencil, risking\
  \ lead poisoning, beflummoxed. But soon enough it was time for Uncle Wilf's daily\
  \ outing, and I pushed him in his super whizzo wheelchair a few times around the\
  \ pond, the pond next to the cement facsimile of the Old Tower of Lobenicht. You\
  \ will recall that as the tower which Immanuel (not Wilf) Kant liked to look at\
  \ through his window as he sat by the stove in circumstances of twilight and quiet\
  \ reverie, not that he could be said properly to see it. Perhaps something of Kant's\
  \ cerebral magnificence imbued my own brain, in spite of the cement copy being a\
  \ poor substitute for the real tower, for in a flash of insight I realised what\
  \ it was you were up to.\nMy theory, which I am going to write up into an essay\
  \ and have published in some obscure and unread academic journal, Wilf willing,\
  \ is that you were dropping great clanging hints to your readers of the full names\
  \ of some of those Hooting Yard characters whose first names we are never given.\
  \ Wilf Dobson? Wilf Blodgett? Old Ma Wilfette Purgative? Old Farmer Wilf Frack himself?\
  \ You need neither confirm nor deny that this is the case, Mr Key, for so sure am\
  \ I of the stupendous accuracy of my flash of insight that I know, as well as I\
  \ know the consistency of the drool dribbling down my Uncle Wilf's chin, that I\
  \ will be proved correct in the Harmanite court of public opinion, the only court\
  \ that counts.\nYours ever, Tim Thurn Of That Ilk (and his Uncle Wilf, Of That Ilk)\n\
