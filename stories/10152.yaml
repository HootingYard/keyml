text: "I have heard it said that by repeating the word \u201COm\u201D, over and over\
  \ again, for hours upon end, one can achieve a state of spiritual transcendence.\
  \ The person from whom I heard this was an ancient mystic with a straggly beard\
  \ who was sitting cross-legged three-quarters of the way up a mountain slope, where\
  \ the air was rarefied. I was panting and out of breath and relying on my Alpenstock\
  \ to keep me upright. Then all of a sudden, half hidden in the cloudy mist, I saw\
  \ this fellow, his wrinkled countenance a picture of beatific bliss. Glad of the\
  \ company after so many hours toiling up the mountain by myself, I slumped down\
  \ next to him and we fell into conversation.\n\u201CGood day,\u201D I said. I never\
  \ say \u201CHello\u201D, which is an improper form of greeting in my view, an illegitimate\
  \ coinage by Thomas Edison devised from the huntsman's cry \u201CTally-ho!\u201D\
  \ Look it up.\n\u201CGood day to you, sir,\u201D replied the wrinkled ancient, \u201C\
  You have pierced the cloudy mist by which I am normally occluded from the eyes of\
  \ ordinary mortals.\u201D\nIt had never occurred to me that I might be an extraordinary\
  \ mortal, and the thought was a pleasing one, so I smiled. This is not, generally\
  \ speaking, a good idea, for it is my unfortunate lot that whenever I smile my face\
  \ assumes the rictus cast of a maniac or a death's head, and those who see it tend\
  \ to run screaming. The ancient, however, stayed put. My smile held no terrors for\
  \ him. I began to wonder if anything did.\n\u201CIf what you say is true,\u201D\
  \ I ventured, \u201CCould it be that you are one of those gnomes Rudolf Steiner\
  \ writes about, invisible to the common riffraff, perceived only by those of a more\
  \ elevated insight?\u201D\n\u201CDo I look like a gnome to you?\u201D he asked.\
  \ It was not a snappish response, rather a gentle enquiry.\n\u201CI suppose not,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201CBut as you are squatting cross-legged upon the mountain slope I\
  \ cannot rightly adjudge your full height when in a standing position.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Rest assured I am no gnome,\u201D he said, \u201CI am one of the Hidden Masters\
  \ of whom Madame Blavatsky wrote so eloquently.\u201D\n\u201CWell knock me down\
  \ with a feather,\u201D I said, \u201CBut I thought you had your abode in the mountains\
  \ of Tibet, whereas this is, unless I am mistaken, an Alpine peak.\u201D\nThe ancient\
  \ now moved for the first time since I had encountered him. He slipped one hand\
  \ inside his white robe, and produced a feather, I think one plucked from a kingfisher\
  \ or a heron. He waved it in front of me, and I was propelled flat on my back as\
  \ if the stuffing had been knocked out of me. Gasping for breath, I sat back up\
  \ and goggled at him.\n\u201CI did as you asked,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd now in\
  \ return you must do as I ask.\u201D\n\u201CWhat do you want me to do?\u201D I said,\
  \ between gulps for rarefied air.\n\u201CContinue up to the top of the mountain,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201CWhen you reach the summit, you will see that it is strewn with\
  \ small pebbles. One among these pebbles, just one! mark you, is a mystic pebble,\
  \ possession of which grants visions of realms beyond human sense to the possessor.\
  \ You must find that pebble among all the other pebbles and bring it down from the\
  \ mountaintop to me.\u201D\n\u201CHow will I know which is the right pebble?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\nIt was at this point in the conversation that he vouchsafed to me the\
  \ business about repeating \u201COm\u201D over and over again, for hours upon end,\
  \ until I reached a state of spiritual transcendence.\n\u201CWhen that state is\
  \ achieved,\u201D he said, \u201CYou will be able to perceive the mystic glow of\
  \ the mystic pebble. Then you must pick it up, pop it for safekeeping into your\
  \ mouth, as if you were a Beckettian tramp, and suck upon it while you clamber back\
  \ down the mountain.\u201D\n\u201CYes, oh Master!\u201D I said, and up I went.\n\
  The air was more rarefied still at the summit, and I was gasping for breath as I\
  \ collapsed on the peak next to a patch of strewn pebbles. I poked at them with\
  \ my Alpenstock, wondering if I might already be spiritually advanced enough to\
  \ perceive the mystic glow. After all, I had it on the highest authority that I\
  \ was an extraordinary mortal who had pierced the cloudy mists which normally occluded\
  \ the Hidden Master. But no particular pebble stood out from among the others, so\
  \ I made myself as comfortable as possible and started to say \u201COm\u201D.\n\u201C\
  Om,\u201D I said, \u201COm Om Om.\u201D\nI felt like a fool. I felt like even more\
  \ of a fool when night crashed down upon the mountaintop and I was still sitting\
  \ there saying \u201COm\u201D. And I felt like the most foolish fool of all fools\
  \ when dawn broke, and I was still sitting there, still saying \u201COm\u201D, over\
  \ and over again.\nIt has been six weeks now. I seem to be clawing my way towards\
  \ a new plane of existence. I experience neither hunger nor thirst. My beard is\
  \ straggly, and the sun has bleached my Alpine mountaineering garb so I appear to\
  \ be wearing a white robe. My Alpenstock has been dragged away and gnawed by a venturesome\
  \ mountain goat. I say \u201COm\u201D and I gaze upon the pebbles, and I await spiritual\
  \ transcendence.\n[2012-09-17]"
