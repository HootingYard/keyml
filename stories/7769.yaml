text: "It was a little late to search for the philosophers\u2019 stone in 1669, yet\
  \ it was in such a search that phosphorus was discovered. Wilhelm Homberg (1652\u2013\
  1715) described it in the following manner: Brand, \u201Ca man little known, of\
  \ low birth, with a bizarre and mysterious nature in all he did, found this luminous\
  \ matter while searching for something else. He was a glassmaker by profession,\
  \ but he had abandoned it in order to be free for the pursuit of the philosophical\
  \ stone with which he was engrossed. Having put it into his mind that the secret\
  \ of the philosophical stone consisted in the preparation of urine, this man worked\
  \ in all kinds of manners and for a very long time without finding anything. Finally,\
  \ in the year 1669, after a strong distillation of urine, he found in the recipient\
  \ a luminant matter that has since been called phosphorus. He showed it to some\
  \ of his friends, among them Mister Kunkel.\u201D\u2026\nTo obtain phosphorus, a\
  \ good proportion of coal (regarded as a type of phlogiston) was added to urine,\
  \ previously thickened by evaporation and preferably after putrefaction, and the\
  \ mixture was heated to the highest attainable temperature. It was obvious that\
  \ phlogiston entered into the composition of the distillation product. The question\
  \ remained whether this product was generated de novo. In his research of 1743 to\
  \ 1746, Andreas Sigismund Marggraf (1709\u20131782) provided the answer. He found\
  \ the new substance in edible plant seeds, and he concluded that it enters the human\
  \ system through the plant food, to be excreted later in the urine. He did not convince\
  \ all the chemists with his reasoning. In 1789, Macquer wrote: \u201CThere are some\
  \ who, even at this time, hold that the phosphorical (\u2018phosphorische\u2019\
  ) acid generates itself in the animals and who consider this to be the \u2018animalistic\
  \ acid.\u2019\u201C\nAlthough Marggraf was more advanced in his arguments than these\
  \ chemists, yet he was a child of his time. The luminescent and combustible, almost\
  \ wax-like substance impressed him greatly. \u201CMy thoughts about the unexpected\
  \ generation of light and fire out of water, fine earth, and phlogiston I reserve\
  \ to describe at a later time.\u201D These thoughts went so far as to connect the\
  \ new marvel with alchemical wonder tales. When Marggraf used the \u201Cessential\
  \ salt of urine,\u201D also called sal microcosmicum, and admixed silver chloride\
  \ (\u201Chorny silver\u201D) to it for the distillation of phosphorus, he expected\
  \ \u201Ca partial conversion of silver by phlogiston and the added fine vitrifiable\
  \ earth, but no trace of a more noble metal appeared.\u201D\nfrom Eduard Farber,\
