text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler, my cupboard contains a bran tub of bittybobs. To\
  \ give you some idea of what I am talking about, here is the Oxford English Dictionary\
  \ definition of bran-tub (with a hyphen) which, as you can see, leads directly to\
  \ its definition of bran-pie (also with a hyphen), a term I confess is entirely\
  \ new to me:\n bran-tub n. = bran-pie n.; also fig.\n1858 C. Parry\_in E. Parry\_\
  Mem. (1870) vii. 173\_\_ It quite reminded me of the bran-tub itself as I unpacked\
  \ each separate article.\n 1909 Westm. Gaz. 22 Apr. 8/2\_\_ Sideshows will contain\
  \ the ever-popular phrenologist's tent and bran-tub.\n 1963 Times Lit. Suppl. 26\
  \ Apr. 313/3\_\_ This is a mathematical bran-tub.\n bran-pie n. a tub full of bran\
  \ with small gifts hidden in it to be drawn out at random, as part of festivities\
  \ at Christmas, etc.\n1877 Cassell's Family Mag. May 377/1\_\_ In the last division\
  \ of the tent we had\u2025a bran-pie.\u2025 The bran-pie was an oblong washing-tub\u2025\
  filled with bran, in which were hidden\u2025small articles.\n 1889 Peel City Guardian\
  \ 28 Dec. 7/4\_\_ Sometimes what is termed a \u2018bran pie\u2019 is employed\u2025\
  for storing the presents in.\n 1904 Daily Chron. 27 Feb. 3/2\_\_ The bran-pie\u2025\
  is the receptacle of second-rate presents: gifts not quite showy enough to be displayed\
  \ upon a Christmas tree.\n 1916 Daily Colonist (Victoria, Brit. Columbia) 4 July\
  \ 4/4\_\_ All sorts of seasonable refreshments will be served and the blue ribbon\
  \ girls will have an attraction in the form of a bran pie.\n 1931 V. Woolf\_Waves\
  \ 236,\_\_ I think more disinterestedly than I could when I was young and must dig\
  \ furiously like a child rummaging in a bran-pie to discover my self.\nI am disconcerted\
  \ to learn, however, that neither bittybob (without a hyphen) nor bitty-bob (with\
  \ a hyphen) is defined in the OED. Can such things be?, to quote Ambrose Bierce.\n\
