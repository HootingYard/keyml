text: "Many years ago, I wrote a story based upon an alphabetic structure, called\
  \ Abandoned Zoo. Yet I could so easily have used the title Alpine Zombie to achieve\
  \ the same narrative ends. Whereas Abandoned Zoo was about an abandoned zoo, Alpine\
  \ Zombie, had it ever been written, would have been about a zombie in the Alps.\
  \ The mood, rather than being one of misty melancholy\u2014and as I recall, there\
  \ was much mist in Abandoned Zoo\u2014would have been closer to terror, as the zombie\
  \ stalked denizens of the Alps such as goatherds and yodelling Edelweiss-pickers.\
  \ I might even have arranged for a walk-on part for Captain Von Trapp, memorably\
  \ played by Christopher Plummer in the film version of The Sound Of Music. How would\
  \ the Austrian martinet have dealt with a threatening zombie? The cold imperious\
  \ contempt with which he faced the Nazis would not, I'll wager, suffice to cow a\
  \ great lumbering glassy-eyed member of the living dead community, as I suppose\
  \ we should call them nowadays. I have not read enough of the literature to know\
  \ if a zombie can be stopped in its tracks by a person brandishing an acoustic guitar,\
  \ gathering around him an ex-nun and several tinies, and launching into an Alpine\
  \ songlet. It would be a tactic worth trying at least once, and that could be made\
  \ the central incident at the heart of the story called Alpine Zombie.\nGiven that\
  \ the central figure in the tale would be a monster of the mountains, my prose would\
  \ have to glisten with sufficiently bright clarity to ensure the reader did not\
  \ mistake the zombie for a Himalayan Yeti. Inserting the \_proper names of a number\
  \ of notable Alpine peaks would help to pin our yarn to its geographical cushion.\
  \ Their deployment within the text could follow an alphabetic schema to enhance\
  \ the A to Z superstructure of our story. Thus, the zombie could pursue Captain\
  \ Von Trapp from Alphubel to Zinalrothorn, taking in, say, Bl\xFCemlisalp and Car\xE8\
  \ Alto and Dom and Eiger and Finsteraarhorn and Grimming and Hochgall and so on\
  \ and so forth along the way. So haphazard and incoherent a journey may make no\
  \ sense, but in dizzying the brains of both the reader and Captain Von Trapp himself,\
  \ it would no doubt add to the terror of the tale.\nIt would probably be a good\
  \ idea to have the ex-nun and the tinies also menaced by zombies, perhaps while\
  \ cowering in a chalet.\n[2010-10-28]"
