  \ skidding in there on all fours. I want to be slipping and sliding and I want to\
  \ hit the gates of heaven with a bang. And when I stand up, when I stand before\
  \ Christ, I want there to be blood on my knees, and my elbows. I want to be covered\
  \ with mud. And I want to be standing there with a ragged breastplate of righteousness,\
  \ and a spear in my hand. And I want to say, \u2018look at me, Jesus, I've been\
  \ in the battles, I've been fighting for you\u2019.\u201D\u2014Retired Lieutenant-General\
