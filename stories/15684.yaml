text: "One morning recently, I walked out of my house and along the path to my front\
  \ gate, and there, standing on the other side of it, was a barbarian. Sensing that\
  \ he was about to smash my gate down with mighty blows from the heavy wooden club\
  \ he was brandishing, I moved to distract his attention by pointing up at the sky\
  \ and saying \u201COh look! A peewit!\u201D\nAccording to Pepinstow's Bumper Book\
  \ of Barbarians, barbarians are particularly partial to peewits, and will usually\
  \ become much less barbaric in their presence. But of course, I had invented the\
  \ peewit, I had pointed at nothing. I was merely playing for time. Soon enough,\
  \ the barbarian at my gate would realise there was not a nearby peewit, and he would\
  \ set about smashing down my gate and laying waste to anything and everything in\
  \ his path, including me.\nAs he turned his head to look up, therefore, I dug into\
  \ my pocket for a glob of plasticine, and swiftly fashioned it into a toy or model\
  \ peewit. It was a pretty cack-handed effort, resembling a punch-drunk starling,\
  \ or even Stalin, rather than a peewit. I hoped nevertheless it would serve to fool\
  \ the barbarian and placate him for a minute or two.\nThis would give me time to\
  \ make a call to the Defence of Civilisation Foot Patrol, who would come screeching\
  \ up in their squad cars and Taser the barbarian. You might wonder why a Foot Patrol\
  \ goes about in cars, but these are strange times, strange times indeed.\nBefore\
  \ I had time to call them, however, the barbarian at my gate had ascertained that\
  \ the sky was empty of peewits, turned his head back to glare at me, spotted the\
  \ plasticine sort-of-peewit in my outstretched hand, made a series of mawkish icky\
  \ cooing noises, grabbed the peewit in his huge hairy paw, and begun dribbling.\
  \ Not for the first time, I gave thanks to Pepinstow.\nBut in the Bumper Book, Pepinstow\
  \ advises strongly against the Tasering of placated barbarians. Apparently, this\
  \ only redoubles their barbarity when the effects of the Taser wear off. Thus I\
  \ was in something of a quandary. The barbarian, too stupid to realise that the\
  \ plasticine peewit was not a real peewit, remained as if transfixed at my gate,\
  \ thus blocking my exit. And I had an urgent appointment at the Village Wrestling\
  \ Ring!\nAlso, it occurred to me that the manner in which the barbarian was mauling\
  \ the peewit, in the mistaken belief that he was coddling it, meant that it would\
  \ soon lose its peewity shape, and be once again a plasticine glob. As soon as the\
  \ barbarian noticed this, he would cease the cooing and the dribbling and be once\
  \ again barbaric. What was it Pepinstow had written? To the barbarian, mauling is\
  \ coddling, or words to that effect.\nI realised I needed a real peewit, one that\
  \ could fly, and thus coax the barbarian to follow it, away from my gate. But where\
  \ could I obtain a peewit at short notice? I rushed back indoors and logged in to\
  \ the ePeewit website on my computer. I noted that there were a couple of fairly\
  \ local peewit vendors, one of whom offered express delivery by drone. I tried to\
  \ place an order, but as usual the ePeewit site was agonisingly slow and repeatedly\
  \ asked me for my password and the name of my childhood pet puppy. I could not remember\
  \ my password and I never had a puppy.\nIn desperation, I wondered if I could make\
  \ my own flying peewit, out of plasticine, by attaching to it a propellor. I had\
  \ a stash of plasticine, but where could I obtain a propellor? Could I make one\
  \ using a couple of drinking straws? Damn Pepinstow for not addressing this eventuality!\n\
  Then I heard the first crunch! of my gate being smashed by the barbarian's club.\
  \ Clearly the plasticine peewit had lost its shape and he was no longer placated.\
  \ I cowered in a corner, listening to the awful sounds of the barbarian destroying\
  \ my gate, and my garden path, and my front door, and anything else in his way as\
  \ he came lumbering, barbarically, into the room. I was about to cry out for mercy,\
  \ using the wording recommended by Pepinstow, when the barbarian laid down his club,\
  \ mopped his brow with a filthy rag, and said:\n\u201CGood morning to you, sir.\
  \ I am Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb. I come from a far country, and my brain\
  \ is hot.\u201D\nNOTA BENE : Readers who have immersed themselves in Mr Key's witterings\
  \ since the last century may recognise this as an hommage to The Immense Duckpond\
  \ Pamphlet (1990).\n[2017-09-23]"
