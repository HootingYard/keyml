text: "Over at Airy Persiflage, Walter O'Hara\u2014known to his friends as Mister\
  \ Nizz\u2014gives a fine rendition of \u201CI Had A Hammer\u201D. I am very fond\
  \ of the grain of his voice, which has the curious quality of making me believe\
  \ every word of what he tells me. There is also a pleasingly ramshackle air to his\
  \ podcast, as if he has simply plopped himself down in front of a microphone for\
  \ a few minutes in between feeding the hens or fixing the roof. (I should make it\
  \ plain here that I am wholly unacquainted with Mr O'Hara and have no idea how he\
  \ spends his days.)\nLinks to his earlier readings from the Hooting Yard Treasury\
  \ O\u2019 Prose can be found here.\n[2011-02-08]"
