text: "\u201CDrink Ye Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take\
  \ You Away\u201D. As we have learned, this was the title of a song written by the\
  \ out of print pamphleteer Dobson, one of several appalling stabs he made at the\
  \ form. No one with any sense has ever listened to a Dobson song more than once,\
  \ for the experience is excruciating, as I can avow. That is by no means all I avow,\
  \ and if we had but world enough and time I would give you a list of every single\
  \ avowal I have ever made, which I am sure you would find interesting reading. Alas,\
  \ time presses, heavy as a big lump of iron, and you will have to be satisfied with\
  \ that single avowal of the frankly horrifying nature of the Dobson songbook, beside\
  \ which the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred is like an infant's picture\
  \ book devoted to perky piglets and bunny rabbits.\n\u201CDrink ye every one the\
  \ waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away\u201D is also a line\
  \ from the Book of Isaiah (Authorised Version, chapter 36, verses 16 and 17). Most\
  \ of the lyrical content of Dobson's wretched songs was taken from Isaiah, for no\
  \ apparent reason. One would have thought so prolific a pamphleteer would have been\
  \ capable of penning his own words, even keen to do so. Not Dobson. What he appears\
  \ to have done, so far as we can tell, is to pick phrases pretty much at random\
  \ from the book Peter Ackroyd has called \u201Ca series of incandescent utterances\u201D\
  , to shove them together with no regard for sense or metre or singability, and then\
  \ to set them to music so woefully inadequate that it beggars belief. No wonder\
  \ Marigold Chew took to wearing a pair of reinforced cork earplugs. Discovering\
  \ that the standard earplugs sold at Hubermann's failed to block out completely\
  \ the din from Dobson's rehearsal room, the resourceful Marigold located a cork\
  \ reinforcing atelier hard by the banks of the Great Frightening River. On her first\
  \ visit, she was surprised to discover the workshop populated entirely by gnomes,\
  \ some Swiss, some Austrian, and some claiming citizenship of Gondwanaland. \u201C\
  They may have been disturbingly-proportioned little men wearing pointed caps,\u201D\
  \ she later wrote, \u201Cbut they certainly knew how to reinforce cork.\u201D As\
  \ with all his fads, Dobson's songwriting shenanigans petered out after a couple\
  \ of months, and peace once more reigned in the house, but Marigold Chew, enchanted,\
  \ continued to visit the little people by the river for the rest of her life.\n\u201C\
  Drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away\u201D\
  \ are the words the Grunty Man roared at a cowering tangle of orphans he waylaid\
  \ one terrible Thursday afternoon. The pallid tinies were foraging for roots and\
  \ scraps in a noisome ditch beyond Blister Lane when cracks of lightning rent the\
  \ sky, thunderclaps boomed, and before they could run back to the safety of the\
  \ orphanage, the Grunty Man was there! They had thought him a mere figment of nightmares,\
  \ but here he was, all too real, solid and hairy and brutish and grunting. They\
  \ trembled as the Grunty Man repeated his strange and evil plan, all except one\
  \ precocious orphan who put her hand up to ask a question, as if she were in a classroom\
  \ rather than in a noisome ditch. This disconcerted the Grunty Man, who was impatient\
  \ for the nippers to glug down the water from their cisterns so he could carry then\
  \ away to his horrible lair up in the hills, as his scheme dictated. \u201CWe did\
  \ not bring our cisterns with us on our foraging expedition,\u201D piped up the\
  \ brave tot, \u201CSo may we be excused to go back to the orphanage and there to\
  \ drink from them every one?\u201D As soon as the Grunty Man had grunted his confused\
  \ agreement, off they all scampered, back to Pang Hill Orphanage, where they armed\
  \ themselves with pitchforks and shovels. Then they burst out through the iron gates\
  \ as one, and ran back to the ditch, and chased the Grunty Man back into the hills\
  \ from whence he had come. For many long years after that fateful Thursday afternoon\
  \ he sat stewing in his lair trying, in his slow-witted way, to work out the flaw\
  \ in his plan, which as I said before, was both strange and evil.\n[2007-06-05]"
