text: "St Dunstan's Cup is the name given to a wassail-and-carousing practice once\
  \ popular in the Fens and the Ditches. In the midst of a wassail-and-carouse, a\
  \ participant would throw their drained goblet up in the air, and whoever caught\
  \ it with one hand upon its descent would become \u201CSt Dunstan\u201D. Other wassailers-and-carousers\
  \ would then pick \u201CSt Dunstan\u201D up, carry him to the yard outwith the wassailing-and-carousing\
  \ parlour, and fling him into a cesspit. After wallowing for a few minutes, \u201C\
  St Dunstan\u201D would then heave himself out of the pit, crawl back into the parlour,\
  \ and shout \u201CWhich among you is my uncle \xC6lfheah, Bishop of Winchester?\u201D\
  \ The person roaring their head off at the most ear-shattering volume would be dubbed\
  \ the Bishop, and \u201CSt Dunstan\u201D would hand them the goblet, which would\
  \ again be tossed into the air, and thus the whole senseless business would begin\
  \ again. At most wassails-and-carouses in the Fens and the Ditches, St Dunstan's\
  \ Cup would continue until everybody present had been flung into the cesspit at\
  \ least once.\nThe practice is thought to have died out with the development of\
  \ modern sanitary methods of coping with human filth and muck. In those wassailing-and-carousing\
  \ parlours which still survive, it has been replaced by a game called St Dunstan's\
  \ Tongs. This is a far more complicated pastime, with abstruse rules, and has been\
  \ described as \u201Ccontract bridge for the hopelessly inebriate\u201D. Some Sunday\
  \ newspapers published in the Fens and Ditches carry columns devoted to the strategy\
  \ and tactics of St Dunstan's Tongs, written in impenetrable prose.\nNext week\_\
