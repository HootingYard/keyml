text: "In her comment on yesterday's Tale of Popsy the Pony, Pansy Cradledew berates\
  \ me for failing to give the name of the squid. I accept that this was an unforgivable\
  \ omission and fatally undermines what might otherwise have been a classic text\
  \ destined to be read and reread and rereread throughout the ages. Thus I am more\

  \ name of the young scamp seen chasing a swan on a new piece of signage in St James's\
  \ Park. He was chosen from a pool of over a thousand applicants to appear on the\
  \ sign. There is some evidence that the pool was the very same pool into which Neville\
  \ Mossop (the squid) slithered, after devouring Popsy the Pony, but this has yet\
  \ to be confirmed.\n\nIncidentally, Neville Mossop also turns up in a new collection\
  \ by twee poet Dennis Beerpint:\nThere was a young fellow from Glossop\n  Whose\
  \ name was Neville Mossop\n  He frightened swans\nThis is one of the so-called \u201C\
