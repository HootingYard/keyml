text: "Herewith Chapter 49 of Pallid Ada, The Crippled Heiress:\nCountless fathoms\
  \ deep, far far below the roiling ocean waves upon which our battered leaking ship\
  \ is pitched and tossed, down, down in the black depths at the very sea bed, in\
  \ a crevice of a rock encrusted with a billion years of salty encrustment, what\
  \ wonders would we see, lit by the glow of fat eerie beings that pulsate and drift\
  \ in the undersea world! Directly below our ship, far, far below, nestled in the\
  \ crevice, there is a man! Dressed in garb half tattered black cloth half trailing\
  \ weed, he is breathing freely, from his perfume bottle atomizer air bulb invention.\
  \ Around him are gathered ranks of aquatic beings, the finned and the tendrilled,\
  \ the suckered and the eyeless, the translucent and those that are mere blobs. They\
  \ are rapt. For, with glubs and gurgles, the man is preaching to them the Word of\
  \ the Lord. The man is none other than Alonzo Plunkett, the kindly Christian gentleman\
  \ we last saw being dragged into the sea from a deserted stretch of British beach\
  \ in the lobster-like claws of a sea monster!\nIt is with the aid of compass and\
  \ sextant and stout-hearted prayer that we have dropped anchor at the very spot,\
  \ in the vastness of the oceans, below which the semi-amphibious benefactor of Pallid\
  \ Ada, the Crippled Heiress, is converting the denizens of the deep. Following his\
  \ briny abduction, a committee of seaside worthies raised funds for a voyage to\
  \ go in search of Plunkett. No better captain could we have than the terrifying\
  \ and God-fearing retired Admiral Pipstrew. Poring over his charts, sucking on his\
  \ pipe, beseeching the Lord, our captain has steered us hither and thither for six\
  \ long years, following the most fleeting of clues, until now the prize is in our\
  \ grasp!\nAuks and guillemots wheel madly in the sky above our ship as, out on deck,\
  \ crewmen Totteridge and Whetstone laboriously engarb themselves in the very best\
  \ shiny brass Victorian diving gear. The captain stands to one side, his highly-polished\
  \ peg leg glistening in the sunlight. Having at the last affixed to their helmets\
  \ unfeasibly extensive lengths of pneumatic rubber tubing, the crewmen topple over\
  \ the side, but not before Admiral Pipstrew booms out a hymn, and we all join in.\
  \ And then, first Totteridge, then Whetstone, are gone, vanished below the waves.\
  \ We can but wait for their return, Alonzo Plunkett safe and sound in the net they\
  \ carry between them.\nSound, did I say? However kindly, however Christian, however\
  \ expert in the geological treasures of the British coastline, how sound can a man\
  \ be after spending six years in the blackest deep, his only company the weird aquatic\
  \ life-forms that God, having made, at once condemned to remain submerged in the\
  \ depths of the blue tumultuous waters? From poop to orlop, as we wait, there are\
  \ mutterings that the Plunkett restored to the world of men will be a twitching\
  \ and shattered glubb-glubbing wreck, drooling brine, his once fine bouffant shockingly\
  \ tangled with weed and sea-scum. The tension mounts, and we busy ourselves with\
  \ abstruse nautical activities, as our captain broods on the bridge, absent-mindedly\
  \ prising barnacles off a stray timber plank.\nNight falls. Night at sea is very\
  \ different to night on land. Better writers than I, immeasurably better, have evoked\
  \ the arresting aura of the sea-night. So much greater are they, the very air around\
  \ them is rarefied and pure and I am not fit to breathe an atom of it. If ever I\
  \ were to meet such a writer, which I would not, but if, say, I was mistakenly invited\
  \ to a swish cocktail party at which one was present, I would expect to be squashed\
  \ beneath their boot like a mite. I am but a humble jack tar, eking my sorry living\
  \ in the rigging, scribbling prose in my too few idle moments, smudging the brine-soaked\
  \ pages as I sweep from them the crumbs of the hard tack biscuits that fall from\
  \ my caried gob.\nDawn breaks, and still there is no sign of Totteridge and Whetstone.\
  \ Dawn at sea offers a very different prospect to dawn on land. There are great\
  \ painters whose canvases will show you why. My own daubs, done with the dregs from\
  \ tins of ship emulsion, will not.\nOur only means of communication with the two\
  \ crewmen gone below to rescue Alonzo Plunkett is a coded system of tugs to the\
  \ ropes to which they are attached. It had been thought prudent not to extend the\
  \ complexity of the system by adding a series of secondary tugs to their pneumatic\
  \ rubber tubing, as a single misjudged tug might disrupt their air supply and consign\
  \ them to a watery death. Admiral Pipstrew, who has not slept, is ready to command\
  \ one tug on the ropes, to signal, as previously arranged, \u201CIs Almighty God\
  \ keeping you safe from harm in the immensity of His fathomless oceans?\u201D But\
  \ he stays his hand when an eagle-eyed cabin boy pipes up to announce that both\
  \ Totteridge's and Whetstone's ropes are being tugged from below. And as we look,\
  \ indeed they are, not merely tugged but yanked, pulled with main force, so threatening\
  \ to topple the mast to which they are lashed. That mast is the mainmast, so as\
  \ it topples, the ship itself will keel over. We are in mortal danger!\nWhatever\
  \ is tugging those ropes has inhuman strength. Our captain has to decide whether\
  \ to sacrifice two of his crew for the good of all. But a night without sleep has\
  \ scattered his wits, and he delays too long. With a last mighty heave, the ship\
  \ is overturned, and every man jack of us is tossed into the sea.\nOur descent to\
  \ the depths is calm and dreamlike. There is no panic, no thrashing about, no bobbing\
  \ to the surface for a last hopeless gulp of air before plunging again. We sink,\
  \ every one of us, slowly and peacefully, until we land, with scarce a bump, on\
  \ the sea bed. And there before us, in translucent shimmers, we see Alonzo Plunkett,\
  \ and Totteridge, and Whetstone, and any number of fantastic marine life-forms,\
  \ greeting us with glub-glub hosannahs, in the undersea paradise built with his\
  \ bare hands by the kindly Christian gentleman during six years of hard subaquatic\
  \ toil, to the glory of God.\n[2009-07-14]"
