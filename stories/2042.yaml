text: "Those of you who enjoyed listening to Norm Sherman's reading of \u201CFar,\
  \ Far Away\u201D will be pleased to hear that this week's featured story on his\
  \ Drabblecast podcast is \u201CBoiled Black Broth And Cornets\u201D. Once again,\
  \ his approach to the telling of the tale is wildly at variance with my own*. Actually,\
  \ I haven't yet read this piece on the radio, but when I do, it will sound completely\
  \ different. I am very fond of Norm's treatment, he somehow makes my words much\
  \ spookier than I thought they were.\nIn the preamble, Norm mentions that he has\
  \ just bought a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude & Pippy Bags. He's obviously\
  \ a very sensible man. If you haven't yet purchased your own copy, do so now.\_\n\
  * UPDATE\_: In a comment on the Drabblecast discussion forum, listener \u201Ctbaker2500\u201D\
  \ concurs: \u201CWhilst listening to the story, I also heard in my head how Frank\
  \ would read it. Two entirely different beasts. Frank always sounds so indifferent,\
  \ Norm so earnest. \u201D Hmm\u2026 \u201Cindifferent\u201D? An interesting choice\
  \ of word. I think it may be the mot juste.\n[2009-03-12]"
