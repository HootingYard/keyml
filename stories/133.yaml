text: "At a jumble sale last week, I was delighted to pick up a bundle of Dennis Beerpint\
  \ poetry books for less than the price of a toffee apple. Well, I say books, but\
  \ these are leaflets really, of between four and twelve pages each, printed with\
  \ a Gestetner machine in the early 1970s. Here at Hooting Yard we think Beerpint\
  \ is a criminally overlooked versifier, often subjected to critical maulings when\
  \ he ought justly be garlanded with laurels.\nMuch of the material in these forgotten\
  \ publications sees Beerpint finding his voice, and admittedly that voice was still\
  \ a little shaky at this early stage in his career. I was struck, however, by the\
  \ odd gem such as Illness, which begins:\nOh how dark the night is / When you've\
  \ got meningitis\nand by Being A Bee, with its wonderfully evocative couplet\nI\
  \ do as I do and I does as I does / And what I do and does is buzz\nI think it is\
  \ lines like these that fool people into thinking Beerpint \u201Ctwee\u201D, or\
  \ a peddler of doggerel. This seems a particularly fatuous accusation when one considers\
  \ titanic works of poesy such as Lines Upon The Death Of Dag Hammarskj\xF6ld In\
  \ A Plane Crash (September 1961), with its vibrant \u201Cpluckety-pluck\u201D rhythms,\
  \ massive resonance, reach, vigour, gargantuan ambition, deliberately blurred vision,\
  \ knock-kneed tremblement, sourness, decisively windswept atmosphere, implacability,\
  \ tartness, muscular bounding strides, and bravery in confronting, head-on, conundrums\
  \ of global significance. It ends with this Beerpintian flourish:\nO Dag! Alenda\
  \ lux ubi orta libertas / I've reserved a pew at your Requiem Mass\nWho else could\
  \ have written that?\n[2007-03-23]"
