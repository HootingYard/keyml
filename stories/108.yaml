text: "This is the coat of arms of Cuxhaven:\n\nIn Cuxhaven, there is a tower built\
  \ of concrete which is inaccessible to the public, which means to you and me, as\
  \ well as to native Cuxhavenites. The significance of this inaccessible Cuxhaven\
  \ tower for denizens of Hooting Yard will become apparent quite soon.\nThere is\
  \ a beach at Cuxhaven, too, which is the setting for Pebblehead's bestselling paperback\
  \ The Beach At Cuxhaven, which I wouldn't recommend, as it is a mere potboiler,\
  \ with wooden characters, leaden imagery, and a pewter plot.\n\n\_\n\_\n[2007-03-10]"
