  the apogee of superficiality\u201D is to scribble a PS on the outside of an already-sealed\
  \ envelope. Clearly this is something only a girly like \u201CCase 11\u201D would\

  \ unmanly fop with an interest in the arts.\nBut wait! His thesis is comprehensively\
  \ demolished when we consider this passage from Richard Holmes's The Age Of Wonder,\
  \ in an account of Mungo Park's second African expedition:\nThe atmosphere among\
  \ the surviving members of the expedition is caught in a letter which the cheery,\
  \ hardbitten Captain John Martyn wrote\u2026 Finally he added a scrawled note on\
  \ the stained outer flap of his letter, dated 4 November. It captures a soldier's-eye\
  \ view of the British imperial mission. \u201CPS Dr Anderson and Mills dead since\

  \ further study.\n[2011-04-19]"
