text: "Astonishingly, today is the fifth anniversary of the publication of Bl\xF6\
  tzmann's historic bird psychology diagram. Ornithologists throughout the world will\
  \ be celebrating this landmark in a manner only ornithologists can, that is, by\
  \ gathering upon promontories peering at the sky while munching filberts.\n\n(Click\
  \ on the diagram for a larger image,)\nIt is hard to put into words the earth-shuddering\
  \ ramifications occasioned by Bl\xF6tzmann's diagram. Certainly it has had immeasurable\
  \ effects upon the way we puny humans apprehend our beak\xE9d, wing\xE9d, airborne\
  \ pals. I for one am reduced to dribbling with joy that I no longer languish in\
  \ bird-ignorance, as I sadly did until this day five long years ago.\nUPDATE\_:\
  \ Inexplicably, several errors crept into the reproduction of Bl\xF6tzmann's diagram.\
  \ The corrected version appears below, and will, again, loom larger should you click\
  \ upon it.\n\n[2011-03-11]"
