text: "\nIt has become something of a clich\xE9 for people to say they are frightened\
  \ of clowns. Far more terrifying, to my mind, are putti. You know where you are\
  \ with a clown\u2014in the Big Top, where he galumphs across the sawdust with a\
  \ bucket and a hooter. But those damnable putti!\nLet's be honest, if you were out\
  \ and about, sashaying along the street, taking the air, and you saw, swooping through\
  \ that air and coming to rest, hovering just above your head, a chubby baby with\
  \ a full head of curly hair, and wings, and possibly armed with a bow and arrow,\
  \ I think you would shriek in terror and run screaming for the hills. This would\
  \ be a mistake. The wiser thing to do, in the circumstances, would be to run screaming\
  \ for shelter, inside an enclosed building, where you could barricade yourself in.\
  \ Putti can fly, but they cannot fly through brick walls.\nIf you run for the hills,\
  \ the putti will follow you, calling out to their putti pals to join them. And that\
  \ call! These are babies, remember, so their call is a godawful infant squeal, accompanied\
  \ by gurgling. By the time you get to the hills, bedraggled and panting, there might\
  \ be dozens or hundreds of putti hovering around you, like drones. If, in your terror,\
  \ you piddle in your pants, as you are likely to do, the putti will giggle, in that\
  \ horrible babyish way that is more like hiccups. Do you really want to find yourself\
  \ alone in the hills beset by a swarm of hiccuping flying babies, some of whom have\
  \ bows and arrows?\nThe wards of our lunatic asylums are crammed with poor souls\
  \ who made the mistake of trying to flee from putti in the open air. The other mistake\
  \ people sometimes make is to think they can turn the tables on the armed putti\
  \ by shooting arrows at them so they drop, fatally wounded, from the sky. This doesn't\
  \ work. You cannot kill a putto. Unlike Ploppo the Clown, they are immortal.\nThankfully,\
  \ since Renaissance times, we have seen rather less of the putti than we used to.\
  \ Scientists are not sure what has caused the drop in numbers. It could be something\
  \ to do with smog. But they are still out there, cherubic and terrifying and swooping\
  \ through the air\u2014flying babies!\u2014and you would do well to be on your guard.\n\
