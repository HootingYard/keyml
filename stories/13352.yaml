text: "I can see my father now\n  With his spade\n  Digging up potatoes\n  In a field\n\
  \  As rain pours down\n  Then trudging back\n  His boots in the muck\n  To the filthy\
  \ cottage\n  Where my mother clutches her rosary beads\n  And prays to the Blessed\
  \ Virgin\n  For more rain\n  And more potatoes\n  To feed the visiting priest\n\
