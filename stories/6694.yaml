text: "Since my appointment with a psychotherapist last week, I have been making strenuous\
  \ efforts to get in touch with my inner glove compartment. To be honest, I didn't\
  \ even know I had one. The psychotherapist, however, was quite sure. Her view was\
  \ that only by allowing my inner glove compartment free rein could I find happiness,\
  \ or, if not happiness, at least a measure of contentment with my lot. When I objected\
  \ that, not being a car owner, I did not actually have an outer glove compartment,\
  \ she waved her hand dismissively and said our session was at an end.\nThe first\
  \ step, I supposed, as I made my way home, was to visualise my inner glove compartment.\
  \ I found this immensely difficult to do, not having an outer one to picture in\
  \ my mind's eye. I thought about various cars I had sat in as a passenger and tried\
  \ to summon up their glove compartments, but to no avail. This led me to question\
  \ the pertinence of the psychotherapist's advice, but I had a whole week to get\
  \ through before I saw her again, during which time I might suffer a complete mental\
  \ collapse if I did not do as I was bid. Were I to dry myself in the air of crime,\
  \ as Arthur Rimbaud once recommended, I could have stolen a car and claimed it as\
  \ my own, and thus gained possession of a glove compartment. But I eschew criminality\
  \ in all its forms, and I have never learned to drive, so that particular avenue\
  \ was not open to me.\nWhat I did, when I got home, was to sit down at my metal\
  \ tapping machine and send messages to everyone I knew who owned a car, asking them\
  \ to furnish me with details of its glove compartment. The replies came in over\
  \ the next couple of days, and from the details afforded to me I built up a mental\
  \ picture of a sort of Ur-glove compartment. I next tried to imagine this being\
  \ lodged inside me, in my brain, or my stomach, or my soul. The psychotherapist\
  \ had not been specific about its location.\nI thought I was getting on quite well,\
  \ and was certainly showing no signs of delirium or derangement or discontent. Then\
  \ I happened to mention the business to a colleague, who suggested that it was perhaps\
  \ the contents of the inner glove compartment, the stuff I had crammed into it,\
  \ with which I needed to get in touch. This was a revelation which necessitated\
  \ a further round of metal tapping machine messages. From the responses I received\
  \ I was able to draw up a lengthy list of items. Granted, this was a list of the\
  \ things my car-owning acquaintances kept in their actual glove compartments, rather\
  \ than the contents of my own inner one, but it gave me something to work with.\
  \ And work I did, my mental cogs whirring away, greased and thrumming.\nI was incapable,\
  \ however, of reaching any sensible conclusions. I had a pretty good idea of the\
  \ general shape and capacity of my inner glove compartment, and had filled it with\
  \ a higgledy-piggledy collection of gubbins drawn from a Dictionary Of Correspondences\
  \ Between The Physical And Psychical Realms by Bl\xF6tzmann. Thus, for example,\
  \ a spare set of car keys in the real world corresponded to a spare set of so-called\
  \ \u201Cspiritual transportation hypnovehicle keys\u201D in the kingdom of the mind,\
  \ and a discarded toffee apple wrapper signified a \u201Cdiscarded mental wrapping,\
  \ a bit sticky, and decisively crumpled\u201D. This was all very well, but what\
  \ did it mean? It wasn't my stuff after all, but the ethereal correspondents of\
  \ my acquaintances\u2019 stuff.\nIt dawned on me that in order to get in touch with\
  \ my inner glove compartment I was going to have to have my own real, solid, physical\
  \ glove compartment after all. Then I could shove various bitty-bobs into it, remove\
  \ them, lay them out neatly on the kitchen table and check each one against its\
  \ corresponding item in Bl\xF6tzmann. I could not afford to buy a car, which in\
  \ any case would be of no use to me, but perhaps I could pick up a secondhand glove\
  \ compartment, salvaged from a pranged and crushed crashed machine. But where would\
  \ I put it? Presumably a glove compartment would have to be inserted into a host\
  \ of some kind to truly count as a glove compartment. Otherwise it might as well\
  \ be an old shoebox or a carton. How much easier things would be if my psychotherapist\
  \ had told me to get in touch with my inner shoebox!\nThe more I thought about my\
  \ inner shoebox, the more it appealed to me. Indeed, I was quite convinced that\
  \ I was already in touch with it, with an intensity my psychotherapist would surely\
  \ approve of. I thus consigned my inner glove compartment to oblivion, and dallied\
  \ with it no more. That is probably why, before my next appointment, I suffered\
  \ a complete mental collapse and was carted off to a grim bleak institution perched\
  \ on a wild and windswept hillside. From my window, I look out upon a major arterial\
  \ thoroughfare, along which, in both directions, cars zoom by. Each one, I know,\
  \ has its own glove compartment, crammed with stuff, stuff of which I can but dream.\n\
