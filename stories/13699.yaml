  \ basket, cloister, hearth,\n  The benefits of an electric bath.\n  Duggleby's lantern,\
  \ Duggleby's tent,\n  Who knows where Van Hooften went?\n  Lumbar puncture, lumber\
  \ yard,\n  Janissary, janitor, sentry, guard,\n  Cuxhaven diphthongs and candy floss,\n\
  \  This paint's matt, that paint's gloss.\n  One must not forget emulsion\n  Nor\
  \ attraction and repulsion.\n  Magnets! Magnets! Hopes and fears\n  And a pair of\
  \ gardening shears.\n  He is still wet behind the ears\n  This rag will mop up all\
  \ his tears.\n  Duggleby went to Banbury Cross\n  But he didn't give a toss.\n \
  \ Crocus, marigold, fuchsia, egg.\n  Two-nil down in the second leg.\n  This paint's\
  \ blue, that paint's pink.\n  Duggleby collapsed on the skating rink.\n  Van Hooften\
  \ planned an imperial spree,\n  Mumbled threats, scrim and scree.\n  Is there a\
  \ doctor in the house?\n  The grunt, the groan, the pang, the grouse,\n  The mordant\
  \ herons on the bank\n  Oh the chains, the chains they clank.\n  Liposuction, fol\
  \ de rol,\n  Cutting capers, eyeless doll.\n  Creeping past the graveyard tombs,\n\
  \  Distant gunfire, distant booms.\n  Squelchy pig boy, guttersnipe,\n  Linctus,\
  \ soup, Gepetto's pipe.\n  He has a jug but I have none.\n  Ah\u2014he flew too\
  \ near the sun.\n  That is why his jug is cracked.\n  Now we are ready for the final\
  \ act.\n  Duggleby darned the curtains well.\n  Lilac scattered on tortoiseshell.\n\
  \  Notwithstanding Cav and Pag\n  He kept them in his pippy bag.\n  Duggleby, Duggleby,\
  \ move along,\n  That's the end of the Duggleby song.\n[2015-01-19]"
