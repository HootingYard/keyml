text: "As you lot probably already know, today is the first day of International Brain\
  \ Awareness Week. But not at Hooting Yard! No, here we decided instead to celebrate\
  \ International Lobster Brain Awareness Week. Who gives tuppence for the paltry\
  \ human brain when we could be raising our awareness of the majestic brain of the\
  \ lobster? It is an organ that, as one noteworthy lobster enthusiast claimed, is\
  \ quite possibly the pinnacle of God's creation.\nThe first thing you ought to know\
  \ about the lobster brain is that it is roughly the size of the tip of a ballpoint\
  \ pen, or Biro. Imagine that! There are several other things you will wish to know,\
  \ but we have a whole week ahead, so be patient.\nIf there is anything in particular\
  \ you are keen to be made aware of, with regard to the brains of lobsters, please\
  \ add your questions in the Comments. We have a team of lobster experts standing\
  \ by, ready to answer them.\nNota Bene\_: Please feel free to frame your questions\
  \ in the language of lobsters.\n[2017-03-13]"
