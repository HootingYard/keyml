text: "From Wasp Watch to Walrus Watch. Glyn Webster prods me in the direction of\
  \ The Dim-Post and its Walrus o\u2019 the Day. I agree with Mr Webster that it is\
  \ indeed a most magnificent walrus. The pedant in me hesitated to link to it, due\
  \ to the annoyingly misplaced apostrophe in the postage title, but I am in a magnanimous\
  \ mood. Also, comment number four, from \u201Cgarethw\u201D, which I recommend you\
  \ read after glorying in the visual magnificence of the walrus, served to remind\
  \ me that it is quite some time since I have been active in my pursuit of L'Oreal.\
  \ Readers may recall that I was outraged to discover the company was claiming to\
  \ have invented light reflecting booster technology, even employing the airhead\
  \ Andie MacDowell to parrot this balderdash in its television adverts. For the umpteenth\
  \ time, let me set the record straight. Light reflecting booster technology was\
  \ originated and developed and concocted and devised here at Hooting Yard, for purposes\
  \ other than hair. One day, I feel sure, L'Oreal will admit this, and get me to\
  \ disport my bouffant in their adverts instead. Perhaps they think I have let them\
  \ off the hook. Not so! I shall fire off one of my much delayed more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger\
  \ missives later today.\n[2009-10-19]"
