text: "\u201CThe Theobald case . . . is of importance because it demonstrates how\
  \ blind, unquestioning belief in the occult powers thought to be about them could\
  \ reduce the attitude of a private educated family of the England of the 1880's\
  \ towards their own lives to a condition where it becomes difficult to believe that\
  \ they were of sane mind. Morell Theobald was a well-known chartered accountant,\
  \ a member of the first Council of the Society for Psychical Research and its first\
  \ Hon. Treasurer. Over a period of some years the most extraordinary phenomena were\
  \ alleged to have occurred in Mr Theobald's house, in which the whole family ultimately\
  \ became involved. Dr Dingwall wrote:\nIn 1882 Mr Theobald had engaged a new cook\
  \ who turned out to be a very powerful physical medium. Since she found it very\
  \ difficult to get up in the morning and to get breakfast at 8 a.m. so that Mr Theobald\
  \ could catch his train, the spirits intervened. Fires were lit in the kitchen:\
  \ the table laid: kettles put on to boil: the tea made, and occasionally the boiling\
  \ water transported at a distance from one kettle to another. Hundreds of spirit-writings\
  \ were found on ceilings and walls and other astonishing phenomena went on from\
  \ year to year. Not only did the spirits help in the domestic work of the house:\
  \ they helped to move the baggage when the family was away: and on one occasion\
  \ the cook and Miss Theobald passed a bath, laden with various objects, going down\
  \ the stairs by itself just as they were going up.\n\u201CTheobald described these\
  \ wonders in a series of letters to the spiritualist magazine Light in 1884, and\
  \ in his book Spirit Workers in the Home Circle published in 1887. Other incredible\
  \ events included the unpacking of a picnic hamper by the spirits, and the supernatural\
  \ cooking of puddings for the Sunday evening meal whilst the family were holding\
  \ s\xE9ances. Whether the spirits assisted Theobald in his auditing of the accounts\
  \ of the S.P.R., a duty which he carried out for ten years, I do not know.\u201D\
