text: "Newspaper reports of the annual swan upping on the Thames reminded me of an\
  \ amusing swan-related matter which I had unaccountably forgotten to mention. During\
  \ the Wimbledon tennis championships, I forget which game exactly though it may\
  \ have been one of the men's semi-finals, during one of the breaks between sets,\
  \ the BBC cameras drifted off to the surrounding scene, and showed a jetty by the\
  \ river around which sunbathers sprawled. Also present was a swan, approached by\
  \ a tiny tot who looked as if she was wanting to feed it a sandwich. The proximity\
  \ of tot to swan led one of the commentary team to observe that, belying their elegance\
  \ and grace, swans are of course savage and aggressive creatures. Whereupon fellow-commentator\
  \ Tim Henman\u2014whose surname suggests he knows a thing or two about birds, or\
  \ at least about poultry\u2014said (and I paraphrase from memory):\nWhenever you\
  \ see a swan, someone always points out that they are capable of breaking your arm.\
  \ Have you ever met anybody who's had their arm broken by a swan? I haven't.\nSadly,\
  \ the cameras then returned to the tennis, and we were not treated to any further\
  \ swan-talk from Hen-man.\n\nSwan upping in the last century\n[2013-07-19]"
