  \ February 2006:\n\nAlmost exactly two years ago, on 13 March 2004 to be precise,\
  \ our quote of the day was by William Hope Hodgson, from From The Tideless Sea.\
  \ To jog your memories, he wrote\nI am writing this in the saloon of the sailing\
  \ ship, Homebird, and writing with but little hope of human eye ever seeing that\
  \ which I write; for we are in the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea\u2014the Tideless\
  \ Sea of the North Atlantic. From the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see, spread\
  \ out to the far horizon, an interminable waste of weed\u2014a treacherous, silent\
  \ vastitude of slime and hideousness!\nWhen I chose the quotation I was unfamiliar\
  \ with the work of Hodgson, a state of affairs which continued, shamefully, until\
  \ just a few days ago. I am indebted to Tim Gadd for drawing my attention to this\
  \ superb writer and encouraging me to immerse myself in the slimy, weed-choked pages\
  \ of his books.\nWilliam Hope Hodgson (1877\u20131918) was an author, photographer,\
  \ sailor, and body-builder, who wrote four novels before concentrating on short\
  \ fiction. He was killed in the First World War. H. P. Lovecraft was an admirer,\
  \ praising his \u201Cserious treatment of unreality,\u201D and the critic Sam Gafford\
  \ notes \u201Chis apparently inexplicable choice of writing styles\u201D in an essay\
  \ entitled Writing Backwards.\nReading his first published novel, The Boats Of The\
  \ \u2018Glen Carrig\u2019, I was struck by something else \u2018apparently inexplicable\u2019\
  . The story purports to be\nan account of [the boats\u2019] Adventures in the Strange\
  \ places of the Earth, after the foundering of the good ship \u2018Glen Carrig\u2019\
  \ through striking upon a hidden rock in the unknown seas to the Southward, As told\
  \ by John Winterstraw, Gent., to his son James Winterstraw, in the year 1757, and\
  \ by him committed very properly and legibly to manuscript\nso what we get is a\
  \ thrilling yarn wherein the narrator recounts coming ashore in the Land of Lonesomeness.\
  \ . .\nwe found it to be of an abominable flatness, desolate beyond all that I could\
  \ have imagined\u2026 in the end, we found\u2026 a slimy-banked creek\u2026 the\
  \ banks being composed of a vile mud\n. . . before heading off to an island on a\
  \ weed-choked sea where the bulk of the tale takes place. As in From The Tideless\
  \ Sea, the setting is thus an interminable waste of weed\u2014a treacherous, silent\
  \ vastitude of slime and hideousness!\nLurking in the weeds are various disgusting\
  \ creatures which our heroes fight off and outwit, in between doing boat repairs.\
  \ But is there any other writer who would take pains to mention every single occasion\
  \ his characters break off for a meal? Until the end, where several weeks\u2019\
  \ action is summarised, the narrative takes us day by day, and Hodgson regularly\
  \ reassures us that the castaways are getting proper meals.\nI did some basic word-count\
  \ analysis on the novel, and Hodgson's focus of attention became clear. It is indeed\
  \ a weed-choked book\u2014weed, and enticing variants such as the weed-continent,\
  \ appear 223 times (in a 60,000-word text). Considering that our narrator and his\
  \ curiously anonymous pals spend much time in terror of the various disgusting creatures\
  \ I mentioned, it is no surprise to find hideous, monsters, and tentacles accounting\
  \ for a total of 51 words. Yet breakfast, dinner, and food win the day with 53.\
  \ And as it seems de rigueur to have a puff after every meal, smoke is mentioned\
  \ 15 times.\nI have just begun reading Hodgson's second novel, The House On The\
  \ Borderland, and sure enough, by page three,\nTonnison had got the stove lit now\
  \ and was busy cutting slices of bacon into the frying pan.\nI hope an enterprising\
  \ publisher reissues Hodgson's works, if one has not already done so, but I would\
  \ dearly like to see The William Hope Hodgson Recipe Book, a boon for any picnic-person\
  \ in a silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!\n[2013-02-13]"
