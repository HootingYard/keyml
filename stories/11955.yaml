text: "The latest issue of the weekly magazine Doings Of Pebblehead\u2014The Weekly\
  \ Magazine Devoted To The Doings Of The Paperback Potboilerist Pebblehead contains\
  \ a fascinating interview with the paperback potboilerist Pebblehead. In it, he\
  \ announces a brand new work in progress, which he is currently bashing out on his\
  \ typewriter in his so-called chalet o\u2019 prose, pipe clenched between his jaws.\n\
  \u201CAs you know,\u201D he says, \u201CI have written a tremendous number of police\
  \ procedurals, many of them featuring maverick detective Detective Captain Cargpan.\
  \ The other day, I was about to embark on another one when the thought occurred\
  \ to me that perhaps it was time I wrote a different type of procedural. After all,\
  \ why should the police be the only public servants whose procedures are examined\
  \ in forensic and, let us not forget, thrilling detail by fiction writers? God knows\
  \ how many paperbacks and television shows have been devoted to following police\
  \ procedures. Well, I decided to break with convention and write a paperback potboiling\
  \ blockbuster which, while decisively procedural, focusses on different procedures.\
  \ As yet untitled, it will be a lollipop lady procedural, the first, I hope, of\
  \ many.\u201D\nOutside of Britain and Australia, readers may not know what a lollipop\
  \ lady is. Helpfully, then, the editors of Doings Of Pebblehead\u2014The Weekly\
  \ Magazine Devoted To The Doings Of The Paperback Potboilerist Pebblehead provide\
  \ a footnote explaining that a lollipop lady is a lady armed with a circular placard,\
  \ resembling a gigantic lollipop, who strides into the road and causes traffic to\
  \ halt so that gaggles of tinies on their way to their schools self esteem \u2018\
  n\u2019 diversity awareness hubs can cross the road without being squashed to death\
  \ under the wheels of cars, vans, trucks, lorries, buses, coaches, and huge sinister\
  \ smoke-belching tankers such as the one featured in Steven Spielberg's second film,\
  \ Duel (1971), starring Dennis Weaver.\nThe magazine also includes a picture of\
  \ a lollipop lady, similar to the one below, so the more dimwitted among the readers\
  \ can grasp what Pebblehead is talking about.\n\u201CIt seems to me,\u201D continues\
  \ Pebblehead in this fascinating interview, \u201CThat there is a great deal of\
  \ thrilling fictional potential in a lollipop lady procedural following the procedures\
  \ of a lollipop lady. She is a lone figure, striding out into the menace of the\
  \ open road, into the path of cars, vans, trucks, lorries, buses, coaches, and huge\
  \ sinister smoke-belching tankers such as the one featured in Steven Spielberg's\
  \ second film, Duel (1971), starring Dennis Weaver, and causing them to put on their\
  \ brakes and slow to a halt through the sheer force of her personality, not forgetting\
  \ her circular placard resembling a giant lollipop, so that tinies, who without\
  \ her would almost certainly be squashed to death under the wheels of the speeding\
  \ cars, vans, trucks, lorries, buses, coaches, and huge sinister smoke-belching\
  \ tankers such as the one featured in Steven Spielberg's second film, Duel (1971),\
  \ starring Dennis Weaver, can safely reach their schools self esteem \u2018n\u2019\
  \ diversity awareness hubs. At the moment I am tussling with the name to give my\
  \ heroine. I think I might call her Mrs Cargpan. Then readers will have the added\
  \ frisson of wondering if she is the wife of the hero of many of my police procedurals,\
  \ maverick detective Detective Captain Cargpan.\u201D\nSo saying, the indefatigable\
  \ paperback potboilerist clenched his pipe between his jaws and dismissed the callow\
  \ cub reporter from Doings Of Pebblehead\u2014The Weekly Magazine Devoted To The\
  \ Doings Of The Paperback Potboilerist Pebblehead with a lordly wave of his surprisingly\
  \ dainty hand.\n[2013-09-11]"
