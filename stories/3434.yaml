  \ Barry) for providing an answer to the question: \u201CWho was on the bill with\
  \ Russolo and Marinetti when the Futurists visited London, performing at the London\
  \ Coliseum in June 1914?\u201D The query was posed by Ed himself, by the way, but,\
  \ recognising that this information would be of immeasurable benefit to Hooting\
  \ Yard readers, he has kindly allowed me to post the results of his research here,\
  \ including the invaluable links. And the answer is:\nLydia Kyasht, Russian ballerina,\
  \ b.1885, performing an excerpt from\_Javotte.\nHelen Eley and Sam Hearn, after\
  \ their tour of\_Hullo, Tango! (a successful 1913 revue\u2014485 performances in\
  \ the West End \u2013\_ devised by Max Pemberton and Albert de Courville. Music\
  \ by Louis Hirsch; Lyrics by George Arthurs. Additional songs by Maurice Abrahams,\
  \ Grant Clarke and Edgar Leslie. One song from which \u201CGet Out and Get Under\u201D\
  \ was still popular enough to be performed in the 1960s.)\nArthur Winckworth, Emilie\
  \ Smith and\_George Graves & company in\_Koffo of Bond Street (farcical playlet,\
  \ four years old already in 1914, featuring popular comedian Graves and opera singer\
  \ Winckworth).\nGeorge French , b. 1876, Scots comedian and panto star who drew\
  \ on multiple cultural personae including a very popular madcap Geordie footballer,\
  \ chosen to appear in the 1912 Royal Music Hall Command Performance.\nGertie Gitana\
  \ (\u201Cthe Staffordshire Cinderella,\u201D b. 1887), popular for her signature\
  \ tune \u201CNellie Dean\u201D (premiered in 1907). Her earnings rose to well over\
  \ \xA3100 per week and her name could fill any hall. Recorded songs on the Jumbo\
  \ label in 1911\u201413.\nCecilia and Lina Lallier \u2013 no details available\n\
  The Nathal Trio \u2013\_A novel turn. \u201COne of these performers, in the guise\
  \ of a monkey, might be described as Darwin's \u201CMissing Link\u201D. He climbed\
  \ a rope fixed from the orchestra to the roof of the building, gripping with his\
  \ toes as easily as with his fingers, and hanging head downwards from that dizzy\
  \ height, literally made the audience gasp.\u201D\nHenry Helme, a \u201Csinger from\
  \ the French Alps.\u201D\nIn the interlude(s), The Bioscope (films unknown, but\
  \ likely to be independently made in the provinces by small companies and comedic\
  \ in nature: see here.\nAlfred Dove & orchestra, playing (i.a.) Saint Saens\u2019\
  \_Javotte. Dove was conductor of the London Coliseum Orchestra, later the musical\
  \ director for Oswald Stoll, who during the First World War put together all-female\
  \ orchestras. The Coliseum retained its male drummer during the War.\nNote: Marinetti\
  \ \u201Cgot the bird\u201D for a full twenty minutes from the audience \u201Cmore\
  \ thoroughly than we have ever heard it given in the history of variety theatres,\u201D\
  \ according to\_The Stage. Later Marinetti castigated the English newspapers for\
  \ their baleful influence on perceptions of the avant-garde: \u201Cthe public drank\
  \ in their poisonous garbage.\u201D Plus\_\xE7a change?\n[2009-11-13]"
