text: "Every now and then I ponder whether it would be a good idea to abandon all\
  \ this Hooting Yardery and instead devote my energies to writing a blockbuster.\
  \ In my mind's eye I see the shelves of airport bookstalls groaning under the weight\
  \ of sundry copies of a thick paperback with gold-embossed lettering on the cover.\
  \ I further imagine staring at a computer screen on which my earnings from royalties\
  \ and commercial licensing deals are continuously updated, the numbers growing huger\
  \ with every passing second. Meanwhile, the telephone does not stop ringing, as\
  \ calls come in from Hollywood agents desperate to obtain the film rights. And then\
  \ I think, why bother writing the blockbuster? Why not just go straight to the film\
  \ script? I have never actually attempted to write a screenplay, but it can't be\
  \ that difficult. Well, maybe it is, but needs must when the devil drives.\nThe\
  \ Devil Drives might have been a good title for my film script a few years ago,\
  \ when Hollywood was enamoured of Satan and all his works. But I suspect the time\
  \ for a road movie in which Beelzebub drives across America wreaking fiendishness\
  \ at every turn has passed. Vampires and zombies seem more the thing these days,\
  \ but that is a furrow well-ploughed.\nSo I decided to play a game of Protagonist\
  \ Location Literary Reference, or Prolo Litref for short. This is a pastime I devised\
  \ myself. You get a set of bleached blank playing cards, and divide them into three.\
  \ Readers with their wits about them will know what to do next, but for any clots\
  \ and dullards drooling their way through this, the idea is that on one set of cards\
  \ you write the names of various protagonists, on another a variety of settings\
  \ or locations, and on the third some interesting literary bittybobs, be they names\
  \ of authors, or book titles, or anecdotes, or what have you. You then splat the\
  \ cards face down in three groups upon a large flat surface, such as an ice rink,\
  \ and pick one card from each.\nThat is how I arrived at the idea for my screenplay,\
  \ which involves an underpants bomber on a submarine, also aboard which are Ted\
  \ Hughes and Sylvia Plath. This seems to me to have the potential to be a surefire\
  \ multiplex hit. I have heard that Hollywood producers sometimes like to have a\
  \ \u201Cwild card\u201D element in a plot, some little thing to differentiate the\
  \ film from a thousand others. In this case, I think that, having Ted Hughes aboard\
  \ the sub\u2014actually, it might be a U-Boat\u2014we could introduce a stowaway\
  \ crow. This would add so many frissons I can't begin to count them.\nAlready I\
  \ am carried away with enthusiasm, and imagining scenes which I will somehow have\
  \ to fit in to the script. Ted and Sylvia kissing and drawing blood from each other,\
  \ as they tended to do. The underpants bomber being revealed to have a morbid fear\
  \ of crows. The U-Boat captain, who I suppose will have to be portrayed negatively,\
  \ shouting orders in German, with subtitles, while water from a leaking pipe drips\
  \ from the brim of his captain's cap.\nMaddened Plathists would no doubt complain,\
  \ and even picket the cinemas, if Ted got to hang out with a U-boat crow without\
  \ Sylvia's enthusiasms being equally catered for, so perhaps she could have a box\
  \ full of bees in the cargo hold. I realise that we would be skittering a little\
  \ close to Snakes On A Plane territory\u2014Bees In A U-Boat\u2014but that is a\
  \ risk I am willing to take. It could also provide the pretext for a scene in which\
  \ the bees somehow get into the underpants bomber's underpants, and either trigger\
  \ or disable the bomb. What the crow might be up to at the time I have not yet worked\
  \ out\u2014probably perching atop Ted's head, cawing.\nThough it would be tempting\
  \ to portray the underpants bomber as a beardy jihadist nutcase, I would like the\
  \ film to be a little more subtle. I am also bearing in mind television showings,\
  \ where, at least in Europe, the Muslim character always turns out to be innocent,\
  \ even saintly, in spite of being a prime suspect early on. Perhaps we would need\
  \ to cast someone like Tom Hanks as the terrorist. The details of why he has a bomb\
  \ in his underpants can be worked on. Perhaps it was placed there against his will?\
  \ By Sylvia? Or by Ted and Sylvia working in unison? There are various possibilities,\
  \ and the great thing is they are all packed with thrills and spills.\nI have mentioned\
  \ that there has to be a lot of water leaking into the U-Boat, which is old and\
  \ riddled with metal fatigue. Seals and bolts creak and strain under the pressure\
  \ as the sub dives ever deeper. It might even be heading into an abyss, a previously\
  \ unknown trench on the sea bed wherein, billions of years ago, superintelligent\
  \ aliens beings formed a colony\u2026 no, no, I am not going to go there.\nActually,\
  \ why make a one-off film when surely a twelve or twenty-four episode television\
  \ series would prove more lucrative? This would necessitate having all the actors\
  \ speaking Danish and wearing chunky knitwear which might get sodden by all that\
  \ leaking water. But there would be time to insert all sorts of subplots and also\
  \ to explore the complex pasts of, and the relationships between the characters.\
  \ Is the captain an old flame of Sylvia's? Is the underpants bomber a failed poet\
  \ with a grudge against Ted? Is the captain a secret Muslim? I don't know if the\
  \ Danes have, or had, U-Boats, but a little tweaking of history is forgiveable.\n\
  Clearly I have a lot of work to do pulling all the strands together, but quite frankly\
  \ I can't see this failing to be a popular success.\n[2012-05-14]"
