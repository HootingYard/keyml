text: "\nTuesday Weld Goes Berserk is the title of a puppet show created by the noted\
  \ glove-puppeteer Dot Glovepup. It acts as a companion piece to her earlier, award-winning\
  \ show Googie Withers Goes Haywire, and has proved equally controversial. Both shows\
  \ are clearly indebted to the traditional Punch And Judy format, with squeaky, braying\
  \ voices and demented violence. Dot Glovepup has been forced, in both cases, to\
  \ add a prominent programme note declaring that \u201Cany resemblance to actual\
  \ persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental\u201D.\nTuesday Weld Goes Berserk\
  \ is divided into three acts. In the first, the Tuesday Weld glove puppet is presented\
  \ as calm, placid, and peaceable. Indeed, one could say that she is wholly inert,\
  \ the better to contrast with the \u201Cgoing berserk\u201D which follows. This\
  \ opening scene lasts anywhere between four and fourteen seconds, depending\u2014\
  according to the glove-puppeteer\u2014on the mood of the audience.\nIn Act Two,\
  \ Tuesday Weld gets married to the British pianist, actor, and comedian Dudley Moore.\
  \ She then goes berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled with pellets\
  \ of lead and then shoving him down a well. Immediately afterwards, Tuesday Weld\
  \ marries the Israeli violinist and conductor Pinchas Zukerman. She proceeds to\
  \ go berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled with wet impacted sand\
  \ and then shoving him down a mineshaft.\nIn Act Three, a police officer attempts\
  \ to arrest Tuesday Weld, but she scampers away and, dressed in a pink duffel coat,\
  \ goes cavorting at nightfall on the beach at Deal, skipping about and waving her\
  \ arms before mincing along the pier and vomiting into the sea, an obvious reference\
  \ to the haunting image of Carry On actor Charles Hawtrey described in the closing\
  \ pages of All The Devils Are Here by David Seabrook (Granta, 2002).\nCritics have\
  \ questioned the absence from the puppet show of Tuesday Weld's first husband, Claude\
  \ Harz. Dot Glovepup, interviewed for the magazine Characters Ignored In Glove Puppet\
  \ Shows Weekly, hinted that he may appear in a planned \u201Cprequel\u201D glove\
  \ puppet show featuring both Tuesday Weld and Googie Withers.\nTuesday Weld Goes\
  \ Berserk is currently showing at a temporary kiosk at the end of the pier at Deal.\
  \ Admission is free to those wearing pink duffel coats.\nNOTA BENE\_: In the text\
  \ above, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.\n\
