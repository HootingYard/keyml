text: 'Those of you who enjoy listening to the Hooting Yard On The Air podcasts, be
  warned. Following an important meeting chaired by Mrs Gubbins, the programmes will
  shortly be recalibrated, and you will no longer be able to listen to them on such
  equipment as iPods and mp3 players. Instead you will need to obtain a 1952 Zenith
  Radio Hat. I am sure you will agree that your listening pleasure will be distinctly
  enhanced.
