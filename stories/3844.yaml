  \ afternoons. Things were not nearly so idyllic for Augustus Hare:\n\u201CI remember\
  \ that one day when we went to visit the curate, a lady very innocently gave me\
  \ a lollypop, which I ate. This crime was discovered when I came home by the smell\
  \ of peppermint, and a large dose of rhubarb and soda was at once administered with\
  \ a forcing-spoon, though I was in robust health at that time, to teach me to avoid\
  \ such carnal indulgences as lollypops for the future. For two years, also, I was\
  \ obliged to swallow a dose of rhubarb every morning and every evening because\u2014\
  according to old-fashioned ideas\u2014it was supposed to \u2018strengthen the stomach\u2019\
  ! I am sure it did me a great deal of harm, and had much to do with accounting for\
  \ my after sickliness.\u201D\nFrom The Years With Mother\_: Being an abridgement\
