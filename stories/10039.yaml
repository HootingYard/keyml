text: "Over in his Inexplicable World yesterday, Outa_Spaceman conducted \u201Can\
  \ experiment in writing something using the first word I read after waking this\
  \ morning\u201D. Sacr\xE9\_bleu!, I thought, now that is a simple and efficacious\
  \ way to solve the problem, which often besets me, of having to summon up from within\
  \ the deep interior cranial nooks and crannies a topic each day to which I can devote\
  \ a thousandish words.\nTwo questions may occur to you about my thinking process:\
  \ (1) Does Mr Key habitually think in French oaths? (2) Why is his thinking so prolix?\n\
  I would like to address both those queries, though I fear that my response to (2)\
  \ would in itself be prolix. I therefore intend to put it to one side, as a topic\
  \ for a future essay on prolix thinking. Had I an in-tray, I would scribble the\
  \ question on a sheet of paper and pop it into the tray, which I visualise as being\
  \ constructed of wire. In the absence of such a tray, I shall merely shove the idea\
  \ into one of those deep interior cranial nooks and crannies and pluck it out, as\
  \ one would thine eye if it offended thee (Matthew 18:9) at an appropriate time.\n\
  As for (1), it is not the case that I habitually think in French oaths. I am to\
  \ all intents and purposes a monoglot, regrettably, though like most people I have\
  \ a little store of foreign words and phrases I am able to deploy when the fancy\
  \ takes me. When my thought processes call for a foreign oath, it is probably more\
  \ likely to be the Russian \u0411\u043E\u0436\u0435 \u043C\u043E\u0439. This is\
  \ pronounced \u201Cbozhe moy\u201D, and translates as \u201CMy God!\u201D, for as\
  \ you will know if you have been reading Hooting Yard assiduously, God in Russian\
  \ is Bog, the root form of \u201Cbozhe\u201D. And if you have not been reading Hooting\
  \ Yard assiduously, then I am afraid all I can say is God\u2014or Bog\u2014help\
  \ you.\nOuta_Spaceman claims that the first word he encountered after he woke up\
  \ yesterday was \u201Copinionated\u201D. Plenty of room for manoeuvre there, and\
  \ had it been by some inexplicable Koestlerian coincidence the first word I had\
  \ read today, I think I could quite easily have strung out a thousandish words,\
  \ particularly if I considered truncations such as pinion and pin. Pinion would\
  \ have allowed me to \u201Cgo off on one\u201D about birds, a topic upon which I\
  \ can expatiate for umpteen thousands of words, as assiduous Hooting Yard readers\
  \ will know (see above).\nUnfortunately, however, the first word I read after waking\
  \ this morning held less promise. While slurping coffee, I picked up the book I\
  \ am currently reading\u2014Saturnine by Rayner Heppenstall\u2014opened it at the\
  \ page where I had slipped my cardboard bookmark\u2014 bearing a photograph of St\
  \ Alberto Hurtado SJ, Jesuit, Priest, Companion of God, Saint, Born 22 January 1901,\
  \ Died 18 August 1952, Canonised 23 October 2005, given to me by Chris Weaver of\
  \ Resonance104.4FM, who believes that I have a \u201Cthing\u201D about Jesuits\u2014\
  and scanned my eyes down the right-hand page (p. 9) where I had left off reading\
  \ yesterday. As is apparent, I have only just started reading this book, but I am\
  \ enjoying it immensely. The Acknowledgements and Disclaimer alone (p. 5) made me\
  \ laugh (though not out loud). Assiduous Hooting Yard readers (see above, see above)\
  \ will I hope have shared that laughter as I fatally interrupted my reading to transcribe\
  \ p. 5 yesterday evening. I say \u201Cfatally\u201D as I barely returned to Saturnine,\
  \ managing only pp. 7\u20139 (or most of 9) before I began to feel sleepy.\nI think\
  \ there are far too many parenthetical and subsidiary clauses in this essay. But\
  \ I am not going to rewrite it. You will just have to cope as best you can.\nSo\
  \ there I was, slurping coffee, shortly after 6.00 a.m., taking Outa_Spaceman as\
  \ my guide, and I read \u201CThe\u201D. Or rather \u201CTHE\u201D, for the typesetting\
  \ of the book (1943) renders the first line of each new section entirely in upper\
  \ case. \u201CTHE\u201D. And what was my project? To write \u201Csomething using\
  \ the first word I read after waking this morning\u201D. A thousandish words on\
  \ \u201CTHE\u201D, then. Any prospect of finding, however tangentially, an ornithological\
  \ angle and thus being able to spout effortlessly until the cows come home was cruelly\
  \ blocked.\nNow I am sure that if I put my mind to it, I probably could bash out\
  \ a thousandish words on the definite article, and the fact that in Saturnine it\
  \ was printed in capital letters would be of enormous help, in that I could prattle\
  \ on about upper and lower case. Well, another time perhaps. For now I decided that\
  \ On \u201CTHE\u201D was a topic for my imaginary wire in-tray. Instead, I would\
  \ resort to cheating. I read on:\nTHE GREAT FROST OF 1938 BEGAN ON DECEMBER 20TH,\
  \ the date of my first visit to the Middlesex Hospital.\nMuch, much more promising\
  \ than a mere \u201CTHE\u201D. I could take as my topic either the Great Frost Of\
  \ 1938 or, failing that, The Great Frost. The latter would allow me to write either\
  \ about the Great Frost of 1683, or of 1709, or indeed of Great Frosts generally,\
  \ with their attendant frost fairs. (If I wrote about frost fairs and frozen rivers\
  \ I would no doubt be able to shoehorn in a paragraph or two about birds, river\
  \ birds such as moorhens and kingfishers.) Alternatively, I could write about Robert\
  \ Frost or David Frost, or both, tackling the thorny question of which more justly\
  \ deserved the title of \u201CThe Great Frost\u201D, were such a title to be bestowed,\
  \ and were it to be limited to the poet or the television person, to the exclusion\
  \ of any other Frosts you might care to name. In fact, such a vista of possibilities\
  \ opened up before me that there was an ominous rumbling noise in the deep interior\
  \ cranial nooks and crannies. I know from bitter experience that this betokens an\
  \ overheated brain, so instead of writing a single word, I slammed Saturnine shut\
  \ and wrapped a cold wet towel around my head and stared out of the window, at crows\
  \ and starlings and sparrows and linnets and pipits and swifts and nuthatches and\
  \ so an ad infinitum.\n[2012-08-30]"
