  \ version of Hooting Yard? Today, news comes in that leads us a little closer to\
  \ answering that age-old question.\nThe comments appended here by readers are always\
  \ worthy of your attention. Occasionally I think it necessary to give a comment\
  \ a more prominent airing, for even the most assiduous reader might miss a buried\
  \ gem. Like this one, received today regarding The Heroic Bus Driver Of Pointy Town:\n\
  Hi there. With all this discussion of our township I thought it was about time we\
  \ thanked you for putting Pointy Town on the map. Well, it already is on the map\
  \ of the Yukon Territory here in Canada, but we don't get to be in the news much.\
  \ Pointy Town has just elected a Mayor for the first time, after being recognised\
  \ as a township, and we have appointed a promotions chief to put us on the Web.\
  \ The Mayor is Johnny Osikomiwasa (proud of his Inuit roots) and his buzz word this\
  \ week is \u2018promotion\u2019. So that's what I am doing. So I intend to climb\
  \ to the top of Pointy Hill (it really is very pointy) and start promoting\u2014\
  well actually I will probably have to do the promoting from my office computer.\
  \ So keep up the good work and tell the world about our Pointy Town. Hugs, Kelly\
  \ (very tired, on fire watch)\nNow, Kelly Le Cornu, my correspondent, has an email\
  \ address at pointytown.com.ca, and I have no reason to believe she is a fictional\
  \ character. Isn't it marvellous to think that there is a real Pointy Town, with\
  \ a Pointy Hill? I am looking forward to the promised web presence of this magnificent\
  \ township, and will certainly link to it. If anyone would like to start planning\
  \ an outing, let me know. As some wag put it the other day, \u201Cit's like Hooting\
  \ Yard gone mad!\u201D\n[2007-03-06]"
