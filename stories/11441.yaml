text: "I am currently reading blockbusting paperback bestseller Gone Girl by Gillian\
  \ Flynn. It's a page-turning thriller which I am much enjoying, in a blockbusting\
  \ paperback bestseller page-turning thriller kind of way. But I reach page 260,\
  \ and lo! there is a sudden and awful clunk! Until now, all the dialogue has been\
  \ believable\u2014you can imagine the characters speaking the words Ms Flynn puts\
  \ in their mouths. But would anyone, in any circumstances, ever, say:\n\u201CI think\
  \ that's it. Yes, Amy is using a Madness song to give me a clue to my own freedom,\
  \ if only I can decipher their wily, ska-infused codes.\u201D\nI shall be looking\
  \ for opportunities to say this as often as possible in future.\n[2013-05-16]"
