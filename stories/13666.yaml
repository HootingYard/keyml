text: "Once upon a time there were three little bunny rabbits. Their names were Flopsy,\
  \ Mopsy, and Satan. Flopsy and Mopsy were completely normal bunny rabbits, but Satan,\
  \ though to all outward appearances he too was a normal bunny rabbit, was in fact\
  \ the devil incarnate, incarnate in the form of a bunny rabbit. Confident in his\
  \ overwhelming power to wreak havoc and destruction upon the earth, Satan was playing\
  \ a long game, biding his time, gambolling in the meadow with Flopsy and Mopsy and\
  \ doing nothing to let slip his true identity.\nIt so happened that one day there\
  \ came clopping by the meadow the itinerant Jesuit Father Ninian Tonguelash, astride\
  \ his elegant horse. Now, wondrously, the disposition of the buttercups splattered\
  \ across the meadow matched precisely the disposition of the stars in their constellations\
  \ in the sky. It was as if the meadow was a mirror image of the night sky, or vice\
  \ versa. I know nothing of astronomy, so cannot tell you which particular constellations\
  \ were reproduced by buttercups on the sublunary sphere. But Father Ninian Tonguelash\
  \ knew all about astronomy, for like all Jesuits he was an intellectual and knew\
  \ everything there is to know about everything, everything, that is, except the\
  \ ineffable mystery of Christ Our Lord, and even of that eternal enigma he knew\
  \ more than most. So as he came clopping past the meadow he could not help but notice\
  \ the remarkable disposition of the buttercups, and he tugged on the reins of his\
  \ horse, brought it to a halt, and dismounted.\n\u201CWait here a while, Keith,\u201D\
  \ he said, popping a sugarlump into the horse's enormous mouth, \u201CThere is something\
  \ I must investigate.\u201D\nFlopsy, Mopsy, and Satan, meanwhile, were gambolling\
  \ about on the far side of the meadow, thoroughly engrossed in whatever unimaginable\
  \ vacuity engrosses little bunny rabbits. This was true even of Satan, for he had\
  \ \u201Cgone native\u201D, as it were, while waiting for the time best suited to\
  \ unleashing pandaemonium upon the world. Not one of the little bunny rabbits paid\
  \ the least attention to the gaunt figure of Father Ninian Tonguelash, stalking\
  \ across the meadow, sprinkling each individual buttercup with holy water for purposes\
  \ only a Jesuit could understand.\nBut as he came closer, the very air shuddered.\
  \ The Jesuit sensed the presence of evil, and Satan sensed the presence of rigorous\
  \ intellectual Roman Catholicism. Father Ninian Tonguelash looked wildly about him,\
  \ trying to pinpoint the source of all that was foul and unholy. But Satan knew\
  \ his enemy immediately. He ceased to gambol, and fixed the Jesuit with a piercing\
  \ gaze of unalloyed hatred. At this critical point, Flopsy's and Mopsy's gambollings\
  \ were so frisky that they collided with the priest's spindly legs and, in his valiant\
  \ efforts not to stamp them underfoot, he toppled over.\nAnd then there was a thunderclap.\
  \ Sudden rain poured down in torrents. Keith the horse swallowed the last of his\
  \ rapidly dissolving sugarlump. Flopsy and Mopsy gambolled away. And with his head\
  \ resting on the grass, Father Ninian Tonguelash gazed into the eyes of Satan, and\
  \ Satan gazed back.\nStrange to think that this otherwise ordinary wet afternoon\
  \ in March could have witnessed the most decisive event in human history. Armageddon\
  \ could have begun, there and then, in a buttercup-splattered meadow. We do not\
  \ know, we cannot guess, who would have emerged victorious. All we can say with\
  \ certainty was that a psychopath-poacher arrived on the scene. From whence he came,\
  \ we know not, and whither he went, only Keith the horse knows.\nThe psychopath-poacher\
  \ levelled his shotgun. First he shot Satan. Then he shot father Ninian Tonguelash.\
  \ Then he plucked a fistful of buttercups, and trudged across the meadow to where\
  \ Keith waited patiently. He climbed into the saddle.\n\u201CGee up!\u201D he yelled,\
  \ and off he galloped on Keith. He had buttercups for his lady-love. In this gorgeous,\
  \ terrible world, even psychopath-poachers have devoted lady-loves.\n[2015-01-12]"
