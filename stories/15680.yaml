  Now then tinies, listen here to yesterday''s edition of Hooting Yard On The Air,
  brought to you by ResonanceFM. But be warned that the show contains unutterable
  Lovecraftian horror. Mr Key reads Mr Key Goes To Innsmouth, Cocking A Snook, and
  tells of the life of Saint Rumwold, The Pious Infant.
