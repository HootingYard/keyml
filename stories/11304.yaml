text: "Close to the ruins of Eynsford Castle, Philip [Heseltine / Peter Warlock] shared\
  \ the small main-street cottage with his composer friend, E. J. Moeran, together\
  \ with a collection of cats and a Maori housekeeper-cum-factotum, Hal Collins (Te\
  \ Akau) (d. 1929). Collins had previously been a barman at a London drinking club.\
  \ [Cecil] Gray gave this intriguing description of him:\n\u201CIn contra-distinction\
  \ to this more or less floating population of cats and women, a permanent member\
  \ of the establishment was a strange character called Hal Collins . . . whose Maori\
  \ grandmother had been a cannibal and used, within his memory, to lament the passing\
  \ of the good old days when she could feast upon her kind. Besides being a graphic\
  \ artist of considerable talent, particularly in woodcut, he was one of those people\
  \ who, without ever having learned a note of music or received a lesson in piano\
  \ playing, have an inborn technical dexterity and a quite remarkable gift for improvisation.\
  \ He used to compose systematically, also, but without being able to write it down;\
  \ I remember him once playing to me a whole act of an opera he had conceived on\
  \ the subject of Tristram Shandy . . . He subsisted chiefly on stout, of which he\
  \ consumed gargantuan quantities, and when elated would perform Maori war dances\
  \ with quite terrifying realism. On spirits, however, he would run completely amok,\
  \ in true native fashion, and on one occasion almost succeeded in massacring the\
  \ entire household.\u201D\nAnother snippet from Peter Warlock\_: The Life Of Philip\
