text: "Last weekend I visited St Ives for the first time in twenty years. In the latter\
  \ part of the last century I went there regularly, for holidays, when I used to\
  \ take regular holidays. In spite of its popularity, I adore the town. Even when\
  \ it is jam-packed with tourists at the height of summer, one does not need to wander\
  \ far to avoid the throng, and out of season it is a delight. On the last weekend\
  \ of September it was not too hideously crowded, and not greatly changed from how\
  \ I remembered it.\n\nOne change, which, given the passing of time, I expected,\
  \ was that my favourite shop would have vanished, and indeed it had. This was The\
  \ Mirror And The Lamp, on St Andrew's Street, just along from the harbour and Market\
  \ Square. In truth, I had never quite understood how the shop survived as long as\
  \ it did, given that it was a secondhand or antiquarian book dealer with a very\
  \ limited stock, mostly of poetry, and that, I recall, of a fairly narrow range.\
  \ My memory may be askew, but I seem to remember it specialised in French symbolists\
  \ and surrealists\u2014not, one would think, exactly what the casual tourist in\
  \ St Ives was looking for.\nThe proprietrix of The Mirror And The Lamp was Gertrude\
  \ Starink, who I remember as a fragile bespectacled bluestocking. In addition to\
  \ books, she also sold her artworks, some paintings and collages, but more enticingly\
  \ small limited-edition illustrated booklets. Of course, ninety percent of the population\
  \ of St Ives consider themselves artists, and bash out seascapes and nautical daubs\
  \ for the tourists. Gertrude Starink's work, while often informed by the locality,\
  \ was of a different order. Her bestseller (I presume) was the commercially-published\
  \ St Ives Alphabet, twenty-six cards reminiscent of a more benign Edward Gorey.\
  \ An additional pleasure of The Mirror And The Lamp was that every purchase was\
  \ individually wrapped\u2014with exquisite care\u2014in paper printed with the shop's\
  \ emblem, reproduced above.\n\nWhen I returned home, it occurred to me to discover\
  \ if Gertrude Starink had left any trace on the interweb. I was saddened to learn\
  \ that she had died in 2002, aged just 54. At the same time, I was intrigued to\
  \ learn that she was originally from Holland, born Ruth Smulders. (Given that my\
  \ own mother spoke Flemish, I was surprised I had not picked up on her accent.)\
  \ She was also considered one of the finest Dutch poets of the late twentieth century,\
  \ having published, over twenty years, a series of \u201Cbundles\u201D under the\
  \ collective title The Road To Egypt. Most interestingly\u2014and somehow absolutely\
  \ in keeping with the woman I remember sat behind her desk in the dark interior\
  \ of that shop\u2014she and her husband Jan (who died earlier this year) had spent\
  \ fifteen years translating into Dutch The Life And Opinions Of Tristram Shandy,\
  \ Gentleman.\nI still adore St Ives, but it is diminished by her absence.\n[2014-10-04]"
