text: "Now, where was I? Away in a haze, probably. But I really must tell you about\
  \ the time Dobson wangled himself a job on Modern Snipe magazine. It is a wonder\
  \ that a pamphleteer with so shaky a grasp of ornithology should seek employ on\
  \ such a title, but Dobson had his reasons. Well, reason. In the course of a conversation\
  \ with a regular down at the Cow & Pins, Dobson learned that the name of the editor\
  \ of Modern Snipe was an anagram of Marigold Chew, and he chose to see in this some\
  \ sort of mystical significance. Ten minutes later, he was hammering in a decidedly\
  \ non-mystical manner on the office door of Grimlaw Chode.\nThe offices of Modern\
  \ Snipe were at that time a suite of rooms on the top floor of a massive and efficient\
  \ laundry building. Steam billowed from open windows and pipes and ducts, and an\
  \ overpowering odour of boiling shirts and soap powder pervaded the neighbourhood.\
  \ Never the most observant of men, Dobson did not look up as he approached to see\
  \ if any birds perched on the roof, but had he done so he would have seen but a\
  \ solitary crow, and not a snipe in sight.\n\nWe do not know how Dobson convinced\
  \ Grimlaw Chode to take him on at once as a special rapporteur, but we do know that\
  \ Chode, like the United Nations, was given to bandying about the word rapporteur\
  \ rather than reporter. There was no element of pretension in this. Chode came from\
  \ a family of international diplomats, and had modelled the editorial structure\
  \ of Modern Snipe on that of a mixture of huge transnational organisations, of which\
  \ the UN was only one. OPEC and CAFCON and SMERSH were in there, too. He gave Dobson\
  \ a blue helmet to wear, and told him to go away and write something exciting about\
  \ snipe.\nIt is tempting here to veer off into a digression about Dobson and hats,\
  \ a topic of endless fascination to some of us. But I fear things would get out\
  \ of hand, particularly if I began to babble on about Dobson's Homburg, itself a\
  \ single hat that evokes a world of allusions and references, from James Mason to\
  \ Procol Harum. Better that we address such matters at another time, and content\
  \ ourselves now with the image of the pamphleteer trudging home along the towpath\
  \ of the canal, a gleaming blue helmet atop his cranium, and the brain inside that\
  \ cranium throbbing with an inchoate tangle of cerebral gibberish, at the dim centre\
  \ of which lurked the signal fact that Dobson knew nothing whatsoever about snipe.\n\
  Marigold Chew was in the back garden, training bees at the trellis, when the pamphleteer\
  \ arrived home. He tossed his blue helmet onto a hat-peg with surprising aplomb,\
  \ and sat down immediately at his escritoire. Pencil sharpened and with a fresh\
  \ notebook open before him, he wrote:\nHow fine a bird the snipe is! But first,\
  \ consider this: he who wishes for the cloths of heaven may find his hopes dashed\
  \ and his garb but rags and tatters. Yet there be not woe in this, for is it not\
  \ the stamp of such a man that he looks out upon a darkling plain and pitches forth\
  \ his wishes into a well where one day pennies will be spilled?\nAt this point Marigold\
  \ Chew came in from the garden. She had one of her trained bees on her shoulder,\
  \ like a pirate's miniature parrot. \u201CWhat on earth is that blue helmet hooked\
  \ on to the hat-peg?\u201D she asked. Dobson explained.\nMarigold Chew was aghast.\
  \ \u201CI have nothing but admiration for your talents as a penny-catch-all pamphleteer,\u201D\
  \ she announced, as her trained bee swapped shoulders, \u201CBut the job of special\
  \ rapporteur on Modern Snipe will prove your undoing!\u201D And she swept dramatically\
  \ out of the door, and headed off in the rain to Huberman's department store, to\
  \ make enquiries about bee baskets. Dobson returned to his notebook.\nAs your special\
  \ rapporteur, he scribbled, it is my job to bring to readers new and unexpected\
  \ perspectives on the travails of the modern snipe. That much I shall do, without\
  \ fear. I once had custody of a clairvoyant pig, and in a very short time it taught\
  \ me many things. One lesson I recall was sweet indeed. At that time I was fond\
  \ of wearing my Homburg hat. It was the hat I wore when studying the Hittites, and\
  \ now I wore the hat to study the pig. One day, walking across a field with the\
  \ pig in tow, I stopped to mop my brow, and removed my hat and placed it on a stone.\
  \ At once, out of the sky swooped a big-beaked bird and perched upon my Homburg.\
  \ Was it a snipe? It may have been. I looked at the bird, and then I turned to look\
  \ at the pig, and I realised with a start that the pig saw neither me nor the bird,\
  \ for being a clairvoyant pig it could see only the future, centuries hence, when\
  \ where we stood was a darkling plain, and the spot where I laid my hat was a deep\
  \ dark well, at the bottom of which was a mountain of pennies chucked in hope by\
  \ generation upon generation of the disappointed. And I further realised that all\
  \ that hope was embodied in the form of the bird perched on my Homburg. And I affirm\
  \ that, yes, it was a snipe.\nThe last sentence was a complete lie, of course, as\
  \ Dobson could affirm no such thing. But he was extremely pleased with his initial\
  \ foray in to the heady world of contemporary ornithological journalism. Slapping\
  \ the blue helmet back on his head, he stuffed the notebook into his satchel and\
  \ crashed out of the door. On the canal towpath, he met Marigold Chew. She was carrying\
  \ half a dozen bee baskets and the evening newspaper.\n\u201CLook at this,\u201D\
  \ she said.\nDobson read the headline on the just-published Evening Dachshund. He\
  \ was not a man who often goggled, but he goggled now. SNIPE MAN SLAIN, it read.\
  \ Within the last hour, Grimlaw Chode had been shot dead. By a sniper. And so ended\
  \ Dobson's career as a birdy rapporteur.\n[2007-07-30]"
