text: "These plastic betrayals, oh how they discomfit me. Harken, child, harken. Elspeth\
  \ is keening next to the ha-ha, undone, again, by foxgloves, again. Of Hubert, the\
  \ verbal mash is clogged, as if by butter unclarified. The child preens near the\
  \ fort.\nThey are taking a heronry census. Noddy's cap snagged on a twig. Elspeth\
  \ miscounted the bobbins. Of Hubert, oh Hubert!, where is he in that mosh pit? A\
  \ flock of seagulls might pass unnoticed before the gong is sounded for supper.\n\
  The clairvoyant, Hetty, wears night-vision goggles. The child's toffee apple lies\
  \ untouched on the windowsill. Elspeth has come unstrung. Of Hubert, dear Hubert,\
  \ word comes of bathtub gin. They count the herons again, using tally sticks.\n\
  What will become of this parcel of land? Soil ne'er smelled so soily. They gathered\
  \ around the box to watch Blunkett weeping, again. The grain of his voice is tape-damaged.\
  \ Elspeth drops her empty teacup on the rug. The child genuflects. Of Hubert, silly\
  \ old Hubert, no angels wassail.\nThese vinegar dusks tug me to The Clappers. Hetty\
  \ is up in the tower. The distant Carpathians shimmer. A dog returns to its vomit.\
  \ Elspeth, and poor Hubert, and the child, pore over photographs. Blunkett in extremis.\
  \ Hubert's weasel moustache.\nThe doctor is coming, on his bicycle. Stunned nightingales\
  \ plummet from the rooftops. Now the child wails for a choc ice. These iron nostrums,\
  \ oh how they break us. The box in the corner has collapsed like a pudding. Harken.\
  \ Harken, to the lovely gunshots.\nBreakfast, the next day, veered from egg to herring.\
  \ The copper came with his truncheon. Hetty's garb was polka-dotted. They awaited\
  \ the final heronry count. Pips were spat into the empty grate. Blunkett seemed\
  \ a distant memory. Wolves circled the grange.\nThere will be no further episodes\
  \ of this shabby soap opera. There was a damning review in The Slop Bucket. \u201C\
  Incoherent gibberish from first to last.\u201D And\u2014pffft!\u2014it is swept\
  \ away and gone.\n[2016-03-08]"
