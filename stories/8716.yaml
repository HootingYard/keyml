text: "It was late on a winter's evening when I turned on to the lane leading to the\
  \ Bad Vicarage. There was ice in the puddles and the thorn bushes glittered in the\
  \ moonlight. On the other side of a filbert hedge a peasant person was worrying\
  \ the ground with an agricultural tool.\n\u201CGood evening, peasant!\u201D I called,\
  \ \u201CCan you tell me who is vicar nowadays in the Bad Vicarage?\u201D\nIt was\
  \ twenty years since I had been in these parts. I doubted that the Bad Vicar of\
  \ the olden days was still in residence, but I wanted to make sure.\n\u201CGood\
  \ evening to you, sir,\u201D said the peasant, resting from his twilight labours\
  \ and leaning on his implement, \u201CThe vicarage is bad indeed, as bad as any\
  \ vicarage in Christendom. But the vicar whose sinecure it is is, shall we say,\
  \ a fair to middling vicar. I would not call him good, but he is by no means as\
  \ bad as the Bad Vicar of old.\u201D\n\u201CThank you,\u201D I said, and felt compelled\
  \ to add \u201CYou are, I may say, very well-spoken for a peasant.\u201D\n\u201C\
  I am a so-called New Peasant,\u201D said the peasant, \u201CMy soul has been re-engineered\
  \ by the Great Helmsman, all praise to him. It was he who ensured the destruction\
  \ of the Bad Vicar, after all.\u201D\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D I asked, \u201CThen\
  \ praise to him indeed, as you say. Yet for all that, the Bad Vicarage is still\
  \ bad, in spite of its fair to middling vicar, and though you are a New Peasant,\
  \ here you are at nightfall, tilling the fields or whatever you are doing with that\
  \ agricultural implement, just as an old peasant would do.\u201D\n\u201CThe countryside\
  \ is the countryside, sir,\u201D he said, gnomically, and he went back to work.\n\
  I carried on up the lane, my mind a welter of chaos. If the Great Helmsman had wrought\
  \ the ruination of the Bad Vicar, why had he left the Bad Vicarage standing? And\
  \ why, installed in it now, was a fair to middling vicar? Were there no good vicars\
  \ in these parts? My uncle, for example, was a good vicar. Why had he been passed\
  \ over for the sinecure? But then, was he still alive, or had he been one of the\
  \ many victims of the Bad Vicar, mourned and unmourned? These and other questions\
  \ tugged at the reins of my sanity as I approached ever closer the great forbidding\
  \ gate of the Bad Vicarage.\nAs if to signal a shift in the very nature of things,\
  \ just as I raised my hand to grasp the bell-pull dangling from the gate, the bright\
  \ moon was of a sudden blotted out behind a cloud. I shuddered, but yanked the rope,\
  \ only to hear a dull flat clunk rather than a clang. A bad bell for a bad vicarage.\
  \ What else should I have expected?\nBut the clunk had the desired effect, for peering\
  \ between the railings I saw the door of the Bad Vicarage creak open, and emerging\
  \ from it a fellow I took to be the fair to middling vicar. He was young and spry\
  \ and came bounding up the path to open the gate for me.\n\u201CYou are the vicar?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\u201CThat I am,\u201D he cried, with unwarranted bonhomie, \u201CCome,\
  \ visiting stranger, for the night is a chill one, and you must warm your collywobbles\
  \ beside a roaring fire.\u201D\nAnd soon enough the two of us were sat in armchairs\
  \ by the fireside, slurping from beakers of hot and vitamin-enhanced goaty milk\
  \ froth. Clearly, in destroying the Bad Vicar, the Great Helmsman had spared his\
  \ goats. I could hear them, tethered in the back garden, bleating and occasionally\
  \ butting their heads against the wall.\n\u201CExplain to me,\u201D I said, coming\
  \ straight to the point, \u201CHow it can be that this vicarage is still a Bad Vicarage,\
  \ when you yourself, armed with the sinecure, are not a Bad Vicar?\u201D\nThe fair\
  \ to middling vicar laughed, slopping some of his milk froth onto the threadbare\
  \ rug at his feet.\n\u201CThis will always be a Bad Vicarage,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  The rugs are threadbare, the floorboards are rotting, the paint is chipping, the\
  \ roof is falling in, the heating is clapped out, the drains are clogged, and the\
  \ goats are maddened.\u201D\n\u201CCould you not see to it that repairs are made\
  \ and the goats inspected by a veterinary surgeon?\u201D I asked.\nHe laughed again,\
  \ but this time it was a hollow laugh of infinite despair.\n\u201CWhat would be\
  \ the use?\u201D he said.\n\u201CWell,\u201D I said, \u201CIf both the repair persons\
  \ and the veterinary surgeons were unstinting in their efforts, it would no longer\
  \ be a Bad Vicarage. It would become fair to middling, and in time, possibly, even\
  \ good. Imagine that.\u201D\nHe put his drained beaker on the rug, stood up, and\
  \ went to stand by the window, peering out, his back turned to me.\n\u201CYou have\
  \ come here, \u201D he said, after some minutes of eerie silence, \u201COn a cold\
  \ winter's evening, uninvited, unannounced. I sense you are no stranger to this\
  \ place. I can hear in the bleating of the goats that they know you, that they have\
  \ encountered you before. Just before you arrived, I received a message on my metal\
  \ tapping machine from the New Peasant stationed behind the filbert hedge at the\
  \ entrance to the lane. He told me you had no need to ask for directions, that you\
  \ made your way here with practised steps, indeed that you minced hither as directly\
  \ as a crow in flight. You nestle in the armchair by the fire and slurp the hot\
  \ and vitamin-enhanced goaty milk froth from the beaker I have given you, and you\
  \ know damned well that the rugs are threadbare, the floorboards are rotting, the\
  \ paint is chipping, the roof is falling in, the heating is clapped out, the drains\
  \ are clogged, and the goats are maddened. You know the Bad Vicarage as well as\
  \ you know the back of your hand. Who the devil are you?\u201D\nAnd he spun around\
  \ to look at me, and I looked back, my red eyes gazing at him like firebolts.\n\u201C\
  I am the Bad Vicar,\u201D I said, \u201CCome to regain my sinecure.\u201D\nAnd,\
  \ at my summons, the maddened goats, their tethers loosed, came crashing through\
  \ the window.\n[2012-03-20]"
