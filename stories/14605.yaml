text: "\nSad news. The Dabbler has been mothballed for an indefinite period\u2014\
  as explained here. I have been contributing to it pretty much every week for five\
  \ and a half years. Those of you with more leisure time than sense may wish to consult\
  \ the full archive of Key's Cupboard. It merely remains for me to thank the redoubtable\
  \ Brit and the other Dabblers for their support over half a decade. And do not forget\
  \ that Dabbler Editions published the comprehensive e-anthology By Aerostat To Hooting\
  \ Yard, edited and introduced by Roland Clare. If you do not yet have a copy, go\
  \ and buy one immediately, or you will be set upon in awful nightmares by the Grunty\
  \ Man.\n[2016-02-21]"
