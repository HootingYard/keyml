text: "Many years ago, in the last century, I began to write an epistolatory novel.\
  \ The opening sentence, as I recall, was\nDear Professor Talc, Thank you for sending\
  \ me an envelope full of flies.\nThere were not many sentences after that, three\
  \ or four perhaps, before it petered out. I did not even get as far as finishing\
  \ the first of what, I suppose, ought to have been dozens or hundreds of letters.\
  \ I have no plans to revisit this abandoned work and to try to make something of\
  \ it. It was a rather foolhardy idea to make one of the protagonists an entomologist,\
  \ when I know virtually nothing of entomology. I might have been on firmer ground\
  \ had I had one, or both, or all of my letter-writers be an ornithologist. Though\
  \ my knowledge of that subject too is scanty, I am able to blather on about birds\
  \ in a reasonably fluent manner. I cannot say the same about insects. So had I,\
  \ for example, begun my novel with the line\nDear Professor Talc, Thank you for\
  \ sending me an envelope full of feathers.\nI might have continued. I might have\
  \ written a long, involved, and emotionally charged epistolatory novel about a gang\
  \ of corresponding ornithologists. I might, in my mid-twenties, have written a bestselling\
  \ blockbuster, the paperback edition with a glossy gold-embossed cover, on sale\
  \ at all the best airport bookstalls. I might have tasted early success, on a global\
  \ scale, and as a consequence become a very different type of writer. Instead of\
  \ languishing, as I do, in penury and obscurity, I might today be lounging on the\
  \ balcony of an Alpine chalet, hearing the approach of my fawning valet, Jarvis,\
  \ bringing, on a silver tray, my lunchtime tipple of aerated lettucewater along\
  \ with the usual pile of urgent pleas from Hollywood moguls seeking to obtain the\
  \ film rights to my latest book. I might have been looking forward to spending the\
  \ evening leaning against a mantelpiece at a glittering and sophisticated cocktail\
  \ party, the cynosure of all eyes. But it was not to be, and all because I wrote\
  \ \u201Cflies\u201D instead of \u201Cfeathers\u201D, and was thus stumped as to\
  \ what on earth I could write next.\nThere is a lesson there, I suppose, but one\
  \ I have learned too late. Or have I learned it at all? This morning, for example,\
  \ I awoke with the phrase \u201Con sudden darting movements in the insect world\u201D\
  \ clattering around inside my head. Before I had even leapt out of bed to ablute\
  \ I decided it would be the title of today's essay. And thus it proved. But in the\
  \ thirty years since I abandoned my novel about a gang of corresponding entomologists,\
  \ have I learned anything more about insects? Have I learned enough, at least, to\
  \ write something informative and involved and emotionally charged about insects\
  \ and their human students? The answer comes easily. No, I have not.\nHere is what\
  \ I do know. That there are certain insects which have the facility to make sudden\
  \ darting movements, so sudden, so darting, that they fill one\u2014well, me\u2014\
  with wonder. Sometimes these insects will be still for a considerable length of\
  \ time, so still they might be in suspended animation, or dead, and then\u2014whizz!\u2014\
  in a split second, in the blink of a human eye, they have darted off, to a distant\
  \ spot, where they might resume their eerie stillness.\nThis is not true of all\
  \ insects. Ants, for example, those tiny creeping things beloved of Horace Donisthorpe,\
  \ are not in general given to sudden darting movements. Consider leafcutter ants,\
  \ which we admire for their stolid implacable scurrying. They do not suddenly flit\
  \ from their column, distracted by who knows what ant-distraction. Nor do any number\
  \ of slow lumbering beetles, which we might encounter toiling slowly across our\
  \ carpets, bent on to us unfathomable beetle business.\nBut if we turn our attention\
  \ to, say, the Gerridae, commonly known as water striders, water bugs, magic bugs,\
  \ pond skaters, skaters, skimmers, water scooters, water skaters, water skeeters,\
  \ water skimmers, water skippers, water spiders, or Jesus bugs, these are insects\
  \ much given to sudden darting movements. Pay a visit to a pond and you might profitably\
  \ watch them, standing still upon the water on their thin spindly stilten legs,\
  \ before their attention is caught by some tiny waterborne being which serves them\
  \ for nutriment, upon which they will pounce and devour. Where you or I would take\
  \ a knife and fork and ever so slowly raise a portion of food to our mouths, the\
  \ water strider cannot afford such leisure. If it crept towards the tiny waterborne\
  \ being at snail's pace, the being would sink or fly out of reach. Hence the evolutionary\
  \ necessity, for the water strider, of its sudden darting movement. So too for flies,\
  \ and other insects I might name were I more learned in entomology than I am.\n\
  It is diverting to imagine what a human might look like were we able to make sudden\
  \ darting movements on a par with certain insects. Let us say I am standing beside\
  \ you at a bus stop when you spot, across the road and some yards to the left, a\
  \ toothsome snack for which you have a sudden insatiable hunger. One moment, there\
  \ you are next to me, and then, in the blink of an eye, you have made a sudden darting\
  \ movement, and appear, as if teleported, across the road and some yards to the\
  \ left, stuffing your face in a somewhat disgusting fashion with the snack item.\n\
  In The Fly (David Cronenberg, 1986), Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle suggests this\
  \ sudden darting facility by jerking his head in spasms. It is rather disconcerting,\
  \ to see a human act so, and reminds us of the gulf that lies between us and the\
  \ insect world. Perhaps we ought to be thankful that we are incapable of such sudden\
  \ darting movements as are made by flies etcetera. Life is stressful enough as it\
  \ is.\n\nA water strider, snapped before it made a sudden darting movement out of\
  \ shot\n[2012-03-21]"
