text: "From the archives, August 2012:\nI used to know a man who, like Sloppy in Our\
  \ Mutual Friend, could do the Police in different voices. It began as a party trick,\
  \ for which he always received thunderous rounds of applause, upon which he eventually\
  \ became dependent. There came a time when he no longer used his normal speaking\
  \ voice at all. He couched every single utterance in one of his different Police\
  \ voices, but the novelty wore off, and people no longer clapped, and he grew sour\
  \ and disillusioned and rancorous, and ended his days drunk to high heaven sprawled\
  \ on the floor of a hotel lobby at a seaside resort. It is a cautionary tale, then,\
  \ his life.\nBut that ruinous end cannot dim the joy of his early forays into doing\
  \ the Police in different voices. I remember as if it were yesterday the first time\
  \ I came across him. I was attending a sophisticated cocktail party in a sophisticated\
  \ house in a sophisticated part of town, and, being myself deeply and ineradicably\
  \ unsophisticated, was having a rather hard time mingling. I was leaning against\
  \ a mantelpiece, trying my best to look insouciant, but the only people who deigned\
  \ to speak to me were those who challenged my very presence, accusing me of being\
  \ some kind of valet or factotum or, worse, an interloper. I grew increasingly cantankerous,\
  \ losing any sheen of sophistication I might have hoped to assume. I spat at people\
  \ and pointedly ground out my cigarette butts on the expensive carpet. Across the\
  \ room I saw a couple of genuine factotae approaching, huge burly monobrowed fellows,\
  \ like minatory bears, bent, I supposed, on chucking me out into the street. Before\
  \ they reached me, however, the hubbub of sophisticated chitchat suddenly ceased,\
  \ and one voice was ringing out solo.\n\u201COn the fifteenth inst at eight forty-six\
  \ pee em I was proceeding along Letsby Avenue in a northerly direction when I spotted\
  \ the accused taunting a kitten. I apprehended him in the course of this bestial\
  \ enormity and\u2014\u201C and then, without missing a beat, he quoted that twit-and-jug\
  \ bit from The Waste Land, \u201C\u2014Twit twit twit, Jug jug jug jug jug jug,\
  \ So rudely forc'd, Tereu\u201D. Then he continued, in so deep and grave and sonorous\
  \ a voice we might have been listening to T S Eliot himself, \u201CAnd I dragged\
  \ him down to the nick for a mild roughing-up by some of Inspector Cargpan's boys.\u201D\
  \ It was marvellous, and we all applauded, and my lack of sophistication was forgotten\
  \ as all eyes turned to the owner of the voice.\nOr, as I learned soon enough, voices.\
  \ A couple of weeks later I went to another sophisticated cocktail party. This time\
  \ I took the precaution of wearing spats and a dressing gown, to give myself airs.\
  \ I was leaning against a mantelpiece when once again, there was a hush and a single\
  \ voice made itself heard:\n\u201COn the sixteenth inst at six fourteen pee em I\
  \ was proceeding along Letsby Avenue in a westerly direction when I spotted the\
  \ accused engaged in a hate crime against a sparrow. No! Oo-er, missus. Really!\
  \ Nay, nay and thrice may! Titter ye not! Oo-er. I dragged him down to the nick\
  \ and handed him over to Inspector Cargpan's boys for a roughing-up in the basement.\u201D\
  \nIt was extraordinary. There was no hint of T S Eliot. This time it was is if Frankie\
  \ Howerd had come back to life. Again there was a round of applause. I left my mantelpiece\
  \ and made my way across the room to congratulate the speaker personally, but before\
  \ I could reach him he had flitted away, possibly with some of the silverware tucked\
  \ in his pocket.\nOver the next few years, during my inveterate partygoing, I came\
  \ upon the fellow, who I had dubbed \u201CSloppy\u201D after his Dickensian inspiration,\
  \ on numerous occasions. Every time I heard him he do the Police in different voices.\
  \ Some of them were recognisable. As with his Eliot and Howerd, he could do pitch\
  \ perfect impersonations of Enoch Powell and Bernard Levin, both Mike and Bernie\
  \ Winters, and the Irish one-time hostage Brian Keenan. I even heard him do Yoko\
  \ Ono. He had other voices which seemed to spring from his repertoire of invented\
  \ characters, a chuckling Quaker, for example, and a breathless bike wanker. He\
  \ never repeated himself.\nThe last time I saw, or rather heard, Sloppy, was at\
  \ a sophisticated cocktail party at an art gallery private view. I was leaning against\
  \ a mantelpiece staring vacantly at a splattery daub when a voice rose above the\
  \ arty babbling. And this time it was not a speaking voice. Sloppy was singing!\
  \ Well, perhaps it would be more accurate to say he was caterwauling, in an ear-splitting\
  \ high-pitched screech. I recognised that sound immediately, and did not need to\
  \ wait for the words \u201CRoxanne, you don't have to put on the red light\u201D\
  \ to know he was doing the Police in the voice of Gordon Sumner.\nThat, at least,\
  \ was what I thought. But on my way home that night, through certain half-deserted\
  \ streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels and\
  \ sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells, I picked up the Evening Rag, and reading\
  \ it on the unsophisticated top deck of the unsophisticated bus which took me to\
  \ my unsophisticated home, I read that the man I knew as Sloppy had been buried\
  \ that day in a seaside resort graveyard, having died drunk to high heaven sprawled\
  \ on the floor of a hotel lobby earlier in the week. I realised, with a shock, that\
  \ the screeching caterwauler at the private view must have been Sumner himself,\
  \ and I wept. I could connect Nothing with nothing. The broken finger-nails of dirty\
  \ hands. My people humble people who expect Nothing.\nla la\nTo Carthage then I\
  \ came\nBurning burning burning burning\nO Lord Thou pluckest me out\nO Lord Thou\
  \ pluckest\nburning.\n[2018-07-14]"
