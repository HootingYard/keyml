text: 'Barring cancellations or hissy fits, next week will see the first of Hooting
  Yard''s new Public Seminars where matters of great import will be debated by a mix
  of experts, intellectuals, charlatans, rascals, and persons of fecklessness.

  The topic of our first debate is Life Beyond Death, and will be an exciting head-to-head
  pitting the enormously wealthy best-selling author Deepak Chopra against Hooting
  Yard''s very own Little Severin, The Mystic Badger. Mr Chopra will argue that he
  has spiritual insights into life after death, based on his rigorous and expert understanding
  of quantum physics. Little Severin will scrubble about in the undergrowth and snuffle
  the air in his mystic way, thus proving a worthy opponent. Claims that the debate
  is weighted too heavily in Mr Chopra''s favour can be summarily disposed of. Little
  Severin knows just as much about quantum physics as his human opponent, if not more
  so, and to suggest that the badger will be outwitted is plain wrong. You''ll see.

  The debate will take place in a tent in the middle of a field near Sawdust Bridge.
  Tickets to see Little Severin are free, but unfortunately you will have to pay through
  the nose to see Mr Chopra''s segment, for so high a spiritual plane has he reached
  through use of Transcendental Meditation and other techniques that it takes an enormous
  cashflow to keep him bobbing up there in the mystic aether. In addition to a wallet
  packed with cash, please bring some grubs and roots to donate to Little Severin''s
  cupboard.
