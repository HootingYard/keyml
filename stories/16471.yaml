text: "Henry Fuseli ate a diet of raw meat in order to obtain splendid dreams. Lamb\
  \ spoke of \u201CLilliputian rabbits\u201D when eating frog fricassee; and his sister\
  \ Mary, wielding a knife, chased a little girl who was helping her in the kitchen\
  \ and then stabbed her own mother through the heart; Hazlitt was perceptive about\
  \ musculature and boxers; Wordsworth used a buttery knife to cut the pages of a\
  \ first-edition Burke. Coleridge, his head shrouded in a fog, read poetry badly\
  \ and moaned gloomily. The dreams of Jean Paul, the crow that loved the storm, reverberated\
  \ across the Lake District\u2026 There were others who helped themselves to dreams.\
  \ Robert Southey experimented with laughing gas. Ann Radcliffe sought out huge quantities\
  \ of indigestible food to reinforce her terrible night visions. Mrs Leigh Hunt was\
  \ proud to have produced an apocalyptic dream, which then appeared in a poem by\
  \ Shelley. Coleridge, distracted by the scratching of his pen over the paper while\
  \ transcribing his dream, forgot part of it. And Lamb complained about the derelict\
  \ impoverishment of his dreams.\nFrom Three Possible Lives by Fleur Jaeggy (2005).\
  \ The lives of which she writes are of Thomas De Quincey, John Keats, and Marcel\
  \ Schwob.\n[2018-04-06]"
