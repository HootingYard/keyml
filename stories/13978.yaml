text: "\nIn The Dabbler this week I have a good moan about a couple of current exasperations,\
  \ the phrase \u201Cour NHS\u201D and the word \u201Cmum\u201D. The piece ought to\
  \ have been far more vituperative and indeed unsuitable for family reading, but\
  \ the editor chose to illustrate it with a photograph of that lovely cuddly character\
  \ John Lydon, so I suppose it's fortuitous that I toned down my invective.\n[2015-04-24]"
