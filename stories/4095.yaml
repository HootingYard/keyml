text: "Your favourite radio programme, Hooting Yard On The Air, will be six years\
  \ old next month. As happens from time to time, I have been pondering whether or\
  \ not to change the theme tune, which, since very early in the show's run, has been\
  \ the \u201CCaucasian Lullaby\u201D by Slapp Happy & Henry Cow, from the Desperate\
  \ Straights album of 1975. When I mention to people that I am considering a change,\
  \ I am almost invariably met with gasps of horror, as if by dumping the eerie lullaby\
  \ in favour of something else I would be doing violence to a well-loved national\
  \ institution, much as if I were to throw pebbles at Stephen Fry. So there is every\
  \ likelihood the sixth anniversary will come and go without any change whatsoever.\
  \ I am enamoured, though, of the University of Ghana Postal Workers\u2019 Stamp-Cancelling\
  \ Song, also from 1975, which was brought to my attention by Glyn Webster, to whom\
  \ many thanks. Should this become the new Hooting Yard theme? Please make use of\
  \ the Comments to air your views.\n[2010-03-24]"
