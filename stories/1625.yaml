text: "Mr Key tries to avoid ranting here at Hooting Yard. If he started, he might\
  \ never stop. But something got his goat today, belatedly and unexpectedly, so bear\
  \ with him please.\nAnd so we are about to enter the new Dark Ages. Things are bad\
  \ enough already, in Papworld, ruled by airheads for airheads. Now we enter the\
  \ Era of Pap and Darkness. A dim society gets dimmer, in more ways than one.\nI\
  \ read about the new criminal status of the 100W light bulb a while ago, but only\
  \ now have I summoned my rage. This is what happens. Relentless idiocy begets inertia\
  \ even in those of us who still cling helplessly and hopelessly to the Raft of Sense.\n\
  Well, I shall blunder about, in the gloom, half-blind, calling down imprecations\
  \ upon the filament-bulb-hating nitwits. But eventually I will start shouting \u201C\
  Bring me my blubber candles! Forward to the Dark Ages! Give me dimly-lit pap or\
  \ give me death!\u201D And I shall be a good citizen at last, and be given my badge.\n\
