text: "There is a pavilion by the shore. I do not go there any more. I used to visit\
  \ every day on my clomping horse with its rattling dray, and I'd hammer my fists\
  \ upon the door of the pavilion set beside the shore, but I do not go there any\
  \ more. I cannot go there any more.\nI used to clomp along the lane lined by beech\
  \ and larch and plane, but something went wrong in my brain and now I languish in\
  \ the drain.\nI languish in a drainage ditch. I'm smeared with grease and tar and\
  \ pitch. I've lost the use of my lower limbs and at the mercy of vermin's whims.\n\
  All sorts of vermin suck my blood as I lie sprawling in the mud, and others gnaw\
  \ my skin and bones while I groan my dramatic groans.\nAbove me, a hot air balloon\
  \ will be arriving very soon. I'll be winched up by a length of rope, and washed\
  \ with disinfectant soap.\nThe balloonist will sing rousing hymns to cure my withered\
  \ lower limbs, and we'll hover in the boundless sky eating a snack of lemon meringue\
  \ pie.\nThen I'll be dumped back on the lane, a few tweaks putting right my brain,\
  \ and then I shall return once more to the bright pavilion by the shore.\nI'm sure\
  \ there's something, before I go, that you are very keen to know. The balloonist's\
  \ name\u2014don't be a clot! It was Tiny Enid, the heroic tot!\_\n[2009-03-24]"
