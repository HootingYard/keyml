text: "Much as I am enamoured of the idea of sun worship, as practised by Aztec fundamentalists\
  \ and the islanders in The Wicker Man, among others, I cannot help but feel John\
  \ Donne was right when he described the golden orb as a \u201Cbusie old foole\u201D\
  . At Hooting Yard, it is usually overcast, or raining, or snow-smothered, which\
  \ is just how we like it. (To those of you who live in snowless regions, be advised\
  \ that snow is nothing else but the foam or froth of rainwater from heaven.)\nOne\
  \ person who I suspect would have agreed with me was the painter Karl Weschke. When\
  \ asked if he chose to live in Cornwall because of the quality of the light, he\
  \ replied: \u201CCornish light? I've got a 60-watt light-bulb and I keep the curtains\
  \ closed.\u201D\nSee how much one can learn by reading The Dabbler?\n[2010-08-05]"
