text: "\nAnd further, let it be known, known and digested, known and digested and\
  \ regurgitated, regurgitated in the form of words, that it be known better, that\
  \ in the last century Mudchute was the home of a monomaniac. Actually, to call Caspian\
  \ Sea Spanglebag a monomaniac is not strictly true, for he had not one but two abiding\
  \ obsessions.\nThe first, which is of little interest to us, was his conviction\
  \ that the tyrant of the Soviet Union was called Josef Starling, while the heroine\
  \ of Thomas Harris\u2019 The Silence Of The Lambs was named Clarice Stalin. Being\
  \ bonkers, Spanglebag was unmoved by the facts that the moustachioed and heavily\
  \ pockmarked dictator chose the pseudonym \u201CMan of Steel\u201D in preference\
  \ to his real name of Djugashvili, and that the troubled FBI rookie is a fictional\
  \ character.\nBut it was the Mudchute man's belief that hendiadys is a disease afflicting\
  \ poultry, rather than a figure of speech, which consumed most of his energies.\
  \ It would not be an exaggeration to say that Spanglebag declared war on the makers\
  \ of dictionaries, lexicons, grammars and encyclopaedias. Most of the major publishers\
  \ of reference books have somewhere in their archives a fat file containing letters\
  \ with that Mudchute postmark, all written by pencil in tiny, tiny handwriting,\
  \ their tone varying from mild complaint to violent menace. One example will suffice.\n\
  I purchased the latest edition of your wordbook, writes Spanglebag on 23rd June\
  \ 1989, and was surprised to see you define hendiadys as \u201Ca figure of speech\
  \ in which two words connected by a conjunction are used to express a single notion\
  \ that would normally be expressed by an adjective and a substantive; the use of\
  \ two conjoined nouns instead of a noun and modifier\u201D. You then go on to list\
  \ instances from the Bible, such as \u201Ca mouth and wisdom\u201D in Luke 21:15,\
  \ and \u201Cthe hope and resurrection of the dead\u201D in Acts 23:6. I do not take\
  \ kindly to spending money on such drivel, and have torn your worthless book to\
  \ shreds, and I would have scattered those shreds to the winds from atop a hill,\
  \ were there any high hills in Mudchute, which there are not, so instead I steeped\
  \ the shreds in buckets of water until they were but pulp, yes! pulp. Please correct\
  \ your gruesome error in future editions, or I will ensure you become the laughing\
  \ stocks of the reference book world, and you will weep with shame.\nNote that Spanglebag\
  \ sees no reason to advance his own belief that hendiadys has something to do with\
  \ sick poultry. To him, it would have been to point out the obvious, like saying\
  \ that water is wet, that the Pope is Catholic, or that Hooting Yard is by far the\
  \ loveliest thing on the wuh-wuh-wuh, and not just by far, but far and away, away\
  \ with the fairies, tiny delicate shimmering beings with wings, which, if they exist,\
  \ exist only in Cottingley, where they are made of paper, and held in place in the\
  \ garden by means of pins.\nHow pertinent is the fact that this odd little man,\
  \ Spanglebag, lived his whole life in Mudchute, only rarely roaming farther afield?\
  \ I think it is crucial. It made him what he was, even before the construction of\
  \ the Docklands Light Railway. It is as if he embodied the spirit of the place,\
  \ Mudchute's mud and Mudchute's chute, the caked, black, stinking mud and the gleaming\
  \ metal chute down which it slides and slithers and tumbles, into god knows what\
  \ foul pit of hideousness and eeuurrgghh.\n[This is a mildly tweaked version of\
  \ a piece which originally appeared in August 2005. Can it really be so long ago?\
  \ Yes, it can. It is.]\n[2017-10-04]"
