text: "Detective Captain Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb was not related either to the writer\
  \ Ford Madox Ford (1873\u20131939) nor to his grandfather, the painter Ford Madox\
  \ Brown (1821\u20131893). Ford Madox Ford was born Ford Hermann Hueffer, went by\
  \ the name Ford Madox Hueffer, and in 1919, decided to ditch the Hueffer because,\
  \ in the aftermath of the Great War, it sounded too German. Casting around for a\
  \ new surname, he did not look far, and simply repeated the Ford. Similarly, there\
  \ came a point when Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb decided to get rid of the Unstrebnodtalb,\
  \ allegedly because it sounded too foolish, and in choosing a replacement went for\
  \ Madox, so he became known as Ford Madox Madox.\nI have tried to discover if there\
  \ are any notable persons named Madox Ford Madox or Madox Ford Ford, but so far\
  \ without success. Nor have I found anybody called Ford Madox Green or Ford Madox\
  \ Black or Ford Madox followed by any other colour on the spectrum. One will turn\
  \ up eventually, of that I am sure.\nAs a Detective Captain with a clutch of exciting\
  \ cases under his belt, Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb had a vast amount of paperwork\
  \ to do when he changed his name to Ford Madox Madox. He had to go back over all\
  \ his old case files in the basements of several different police stations, crossing\
  \ out Unstrebnodtalb and inserting Madox. This was in the days before Liquid Paper\
  \ correction fluid had been invented by the mother of the Monkee Mike Nesmith, so\
  \ the Detective Captain had to scratch out the Unstrebnodtalbs with a sharp pointy\
  \ blade, without actually gashing a hole in the paper, and then gingerly write Madox\
  \ in the resulting off-white space. How much easier the job would have been had\
  \ Liquid Paper, or its rival, Tipp-Ex been invented!\nIncidentally, there are those\
  \ who claim Mike Nesmith's mother invented Tipp-Ex, but that was a separate innovation\
  \ devised by Wolfgang Dabisch in Germany. Dabisch was not related to any Monkee.\
  \ Liquid Paper was invented in 1951, and Tipp-Ex in 1959. Quite what the difference\
  \ between these two products is I have no idea, save that one is American and the\
  \ other European. Nor do I know if Bette Nesmith Graham and Wolfgang Dabisch ever\
  \ met, at some kind of correction fluid summit. Had they done so, it would certainly\
  \ have been a clash of the titans. I must do further research on this particular\
  \ point, and if I get nowhere, just make something up in lieu of facts.\nBefore\
  \ leaving this absolutely fascinating topic and getting back to our main business\
  \ of the day, which is Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb aka Ford Madox Madox, it is worth\
  \ noting that Dabisch is a splendid surname for an inventor of correction fluid,\
  \ given that you sort of dab the stuff carefully on to the paper, or at least you\
  \ used to, in the days when we used typewriters rather than these newfangled space\
  \ age computers. Of course, some writers stick loyally to their typewriters, and\
  \ some indeed even more loyally to pens and pencils. For all I know there may even\
  \ be writers who still use goose quills. I have been tempted to do so myself, were\
  \ it not that the logistics of creating a daily blog from scratchy goose quill manuscripts\
  \ seems so fearfully complicated.\nI apologise, by the way, for using the word \u201C\
  logistics\u201D. It is one of those words much favoured by the kinds of people who\
  \ like nothing more than to obfuscate and to make simple tasks sound complex. Coupled\
  \ with \u201Csolutions\u201D it is even more horrifying. Though I have to say if\
  \ I saw a van passing with Ford Madox Logistics Solutions emblazoned on its side\
  \ I would be very tempted to scribble down the telephone number or email address\
  \ for future reference. One final logistics note: I have seen an advertising poster\
  \ repeatedly in recent days inviting me to \u201CImagine the Olympic Games without\
  \ logistics\u201D. I have, and they were remarkably like the Olympic Games with\
  \ logistics, but that is perhaps a failure of my imagination.\nA few paragraphs\
  \ ago we left Detective Captain Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb, now Ford Madox Madox,\
  \ in the basement of one among any number of police stations altering old case files,\
  \ scratching out Unstrebnodtalb and inserting Madox. Now admittedly, this is not\
  \ the most enticing of scenes. Even tiptop writers like frizzy-haired Jeanette Winterson\
  \ and that equally frizzy-haired chap, what's his name?, oh yes, Sebastian Faulks,\
  \ would be hard-pressed to make something of it. Grunting detective, in basement,\
  \ armed with sharp pointy thing, scratching away.\nI suppose one could introduce\
  \ a thrilling time-travel element, where a being from the future suddenly materialises\
  \ behind the Detective Captain. Unstrebnodtalb / Madox spins around, a look of astonishment\
  \ on his chops. The being from the future tells him to be not afeared, the way angels\
  \ do in Bible stories, but then assures the Detective Captain he is not an angel.\n\
  \u201CI am merely a being from the future,\u201D he says, \u201C1960, to be precise.\
  \ And in that future which you must find as unimaginable as the Olympic Games without\
  \ logistics, do you know what? We no longer need to scratch out writing with sharp\
  \ pointy blades, for we have something called correction fluid! Look!\u201D\nAnd\
  \ the being takes from one pocket a bottle of Liquid Paper, and from another pocket\
  \ a bottle of Tipp-Ex, and says:\n\u201CNot only do we have correction fluid, we\
  \ have two different types. One is American, and it is called Liquid Paper, and\
  \ the other is German, and called Tipp-Ex.\u201D\nFord Madox Unstrebnodtalb aka\
  \ Madox is goggle-eyed. He reaches out his hands to take one, or both, of the bottles.\
  \ But the being pops them back into his pockets and slaps the Detective Captain's\
  \ hands away.\n\u201CSorry, but I cannot let you use them. Were you to do so, an\
  \ anomaly would be created in the space-time continuum that could have cataclysmic\
  \ world-shuddering effects on the very fabric of the universe!\u201D\nAnd with that,\
  \ he dematerialises, leaving the Detective Captain once again alone in the basement\
  \ of a shabby provincial police station.\nBeat that, Winterson and Faulks, with\
  \ your frizzy hair and Oxbridge backgrounds and publishing contracts!\nAnd Mr Key\
  \ softly and suddenly vanishes away, in search of a bottle of ink and a goose quill\
