  \ up to speed with the doings of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, upon which you occasionally\
  \ report. I wonder if you could tell me if she is in any way related to Willie \u201C\
  Woo Woo\u201D Wong, after whom a San Francisco children's playground is named? My\
  \ tiny daughter has grown fond of Willie \u201CWoo Woo\u201D Wong's swings, and\
  \ is often to be heard screaming and gurgling with delight, noises which in an uncanny\
  \ way remind me of the eldritch wailings of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman as she skips\
  \ and trudges around in the dark dark woods on moonlit nights. What can it all mean?\n\
