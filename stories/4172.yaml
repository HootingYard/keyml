text: "Half a dozen precautions against premature burial:\n\u201CThe novelist Wilkie\
  \ Collins always left a letter on his dressing-table adjuring anyone finding him\
  \ dead to call a doctor and make certain, Harriet Martineau left her doctor ten\
  \ pounds to see that her head was amputated before burial, the actress Ada Cavendish\
  \ willed that her jugular vein be cut before interment, and the journalist Edmund\
  \ Yates did likewise, providing twenty guineas as a fee for the officiating surgeon.\
  \ Lady Burton provided for her heart to be pierced with a needle, while Meyerbeer\
  \ arranged to have bells tied to his extremities when he was dead.\u201D\nRonald\
