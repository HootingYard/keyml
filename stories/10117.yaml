text: "Startlingly hirsute Italian artist Accurso Git unveiled his latest work at\
  \ the Pointy Town Biennale this week. Egregore is an anatomically accurate facsimile\
  \ of the brain, rendered in Git's favourite medium, marshmallow. Intriguingly, the\
  \ startlingly untidy artist has chosen to express the concept of the egregore\u2014\
  an occult concept representing a \u201Cthoughtform\u201D or \u201Ccollective group\
  \ mind\u201D, an autonomous psychic entity\u2014with a marshmallow model not of\
  \ the human brain, but that of the lobster.\nThe students of lobsterdom among you\
  \ will know that the brain of a lobster is about the size of the tip of a ballpoint\
  \ pen. They do not possess the keenest intellects in the animal kingdom. Asked why\
  \ his brain was so tiny, Accurso Git initially misconstrued the question and set\
  \ about his interviewer with his fists, those startlingly hairy fists, with the\
  \ result that the interview had to be postponed for a month while the interviewer\
  \ received hospital treatment. During this time, the startlingly ill-tempered artist\
  \ was given several written assurances that the tiny brain being referred to was\
  \ that of the lobster, not the one encased in his own startlingly enormous head.\
  \ When he was eventually placated, and the interview resumed, in a clinic annexe\
  \ where the interviewer was learning to walk and talk again, Git gave this reply:\n\
  \u201CHave you seen the cost of marshmallows? Add together the prices of sugar and\
  \ corn syrup and water and gelatin that has been softened in hot water and dextrose\
  \ and vanilla flavourings, take into account the optional use of colouring agents\
  \ and/or eggs, tack on the labour involved in whipping the mixture to a spongy consistency,\
  \ and it will be clear even to a simpleton that a startlingly impoverished artist\
  \ like me, the critically acclaimed Accurso Git, could not afford more than a tiny,\
  \ tiny amount of marshmallow. What little money I have must be kept aside for gourmet\
  \ meals and wine and international jetset travel and floozies and pipe tobacco and\
  \ a place at the table in the tiptop casinos! Yet as I struggled to bring to birth\
  \ my vision, I realised that a tiny lobster-brain-sized marshmallow facsimile brain\
  \ was the perfect realisation of the egregore. Were it the size of a human brain,\
  \ it would be too big. Were it smaller than a lobster brain, it would be as near\
  \ as dammit invisible. By settling upon the size I did I have proved yet again that\
  \ I am the greatest artist of this or any other age.\u201D\nThis kind of talk is\
  \ par for the course with the startlingly egotistical artist, and is difficult to\
  \ argue with unless one wishes to end up in hospital alongside others who have crossed\
  \ him. And in truth, he has a point. When one spends many hours in contemplation\
  \ of Egregore, as I have done, the sheer artistic force of the piece becomes clear.\
  \ To a layman it might look like nothing more than a singularly tiny marshmallow\
  \ placed upon a plinth with a glass case surrounding it, the sole object in the\
  \ startlingly vast galeria of the Pointy Town Civic Hall, Scout Hut, & Temporary\
  \ Allotment Rental Office. Yet, as so often, the layman does not see what the piercing\
  \ acuity of the goatee'd, cravat-wearing art critic sees. Admittedly, I too was\
  \ at first deluded into thinking it was a mere miniature marshmallow brain. In fact\
  \ I stomped off to the galeria canteen and unleashed my laptop and, over a startlingly\
  \ ungenerous helping of sausages \u2018n\u2019 pickle, I tapped out an article in\
  \ which I suggested that Accurso Git had lost his mojo.\nWhere, I asked, were the\
  \ signs of the majestic genius whose rendering in marshmallow of the Tet Offensive\
  \ had been at once so offensive and so thick with sugar and corn syrup and water\
  \ and gelatin that had been softened in hot water and dextrose and vanilla flavourings\
  \ and colouring agents and eggs? And where oh where was the startlingly combative\
  \ artist whose marshmallow Noli me tangere somehow cast two millennia of Christian\
  \ art into the dustbin of history?\nThe answer was that he was standing right behind\
  \ me in the canteen, breathing down my neck and with his fists, those startlingly\
  \ bony fists, raised ready to strike. I did what any goatee'd cravat-wearing art\
  \ critic would have done in the circumstances, and offered him a spoonful of pickle.\
  \ While he was engaged in munching it, with his startlingly awful table manners,\
  \ I had time to reassess Egregore. I continued to reassess it until Accurso Git\
  \ dropped his fists, sat down, and called to the waiter for a bottle of wine and\
  \ an ashtray and a floozie. Until, that is, he appeared to be relaxing, and no longer\
  \ startlingly combative. I then gave him what was left of my sausage, for in all\
  \ honesty I had lost my appetite.\nWhat I have not lost my appetite for is Egregore.\
  \ To that end, I obtained a special permit to set up a camp bed in the galeria,\
  \ and I now spend all day, every day, gazing, with my customary piercing acuity,\
  \ at a tiny model of a lobster brain fashioned from sugar and corn syrup and water\
  \ and gelatin that has been softened in hot water and dextrose and vanilla flavourings\
  \ and colouring agents and eggs, then whipped to a spongy consistency by marshmallow\
  \ technicians, more than ever convinced that what I am gazing at is beyond any doubt\
  \ the very finest tiny model of a lobster brain fashioned from sugar and corn syrup\
  \ and water and gelatin that has been softened in hot water and dextrose and vanilla\
  \ flavourings and colouring agents and eggs, then whipped to a spongy consistency\
  \ by marshmallow technicians in the entire history of Western, or indeed any other,\
  \ art. And that is my considered opinion as a goatee'd, cravat wearing art critic\
  \ sans pareil.\n[2012-09-12]"
